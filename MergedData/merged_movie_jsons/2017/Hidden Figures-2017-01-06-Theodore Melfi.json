            "content": "I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for \"colored\" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, \"Hidden Figures,\" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human \"computers\" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As \"colored\" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.",

            "review_title": "Major Feel-Good Movie, just gets better as it goes along",
            "content": "In the opinion of this reviewer, an extraordinary achievement.The characters on which the film is based were special and unique on their own, and well deserving of the sort of semi-documentary films that Hollywood likes to serve up.However, to take that story and bump it up to a major \"feel-good film\" that engages the viewer from the getgo and does not let up until the very end of its 2 hour and 5 minute running time, THAT is what elevates this project to greatness.I want to be clear on this because it is important. There are two ways to do a feel-good film. One is (ironically!) by the numbers, using proved plot arcs and other script devices to make it work. An example of this for example is the latest Disney release MOANA which has taken some heat from critics for being derivative and not original. But that, you see, is the tried and true method to achieve the effect that the producers wanted. And it works.The other way to make a film engaging and fun is to use your instincts and your actors to get the most from each scene. No rule book, no fixed way of doing a scene, just doing what works. This is, I believe the way that writer/director Theodore Melfi set out to do Hidden Figures, and boy did he pull it off! The acting is stellar. Costner has matured in his latest film roles and his work here is as far from the nonsense he used to do (like the dreaded Robin Hood) as the earth is from the sun.Taraji P. Henson finally lands a great role, the kind of role she was looking for when she left the hit series Person of Interest a tad early.And every good film or TV series needs a character who is \"the glue\" or a reference point that the viewer can use, like a compass needle, to see where we are in the main story. Here Octavia Spencer gives the performance of her life as that \"glue\" and helps the director to pace the film.Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is a real gem of a film.First and foremost this is down to some incredible performances. Taraji P Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae were an absolute joy to watch. From the very first scene with all three of them on screen together, you just knew the film was going to be something special. All three of them were fantastic and I couldn't take my eyes off of them. The supporting cast were also great, but it really was all about these three talented actresses smashing it.The story is something very special too. It was one I knew nothing about, but am so glad I now know more about it thanks to this film. Hidden Figures tracks the careers of three women working at NASA at the height of the space race. The film is so inspiring as we witness their perseverance, their incredible spirit and talent, and their pioneering impact on humanity's exploration of space. This alone would have been impressive, but these women were able to achieve what they did in the face of gut wrenching sexism and racism. Hidden Figures does such a good job of shining a light on the racism and despicable attitudes that these women had to face, and as a result is a pretty tough watch at times.What also makes this film very special is the expertly crafted script. If, like me, you have no idea about science and maths, don't let that put you off. The script does a great way of simplifying things, so that you can appreciate the gravity and importance of what these women were doing, without getting bogged down in heavy exposition.I really could not recommend this film enough. Everything about it fits together so perfectly, from the direction to the acting to the score, its just such a good well rounded film.Watch Hidden Figures ASAP! You will not be disappointed.",

            "review_title": "It made for an old-fashioned movie going experience...",
            "content": "This is the true story of three African-American women who worked for NASA on the Mercury program in the early 1960s. Solid performances by all, some laugh-out-loud scenes, and some very emotional moments. It's also an important look back at the civil rights issues of the time period. The climax is a bit Apollo 13ish, and I'm fairly certain some scenes were embellished, but who cares. You should walk away from this film smiling, maybe even a bit choked up.And in spite of it being an overall positive experience, I could feel the oppression at certain points - Dorothy at the library just trying to find the right book, but it is in a part of the library to which she cannot gain admittance due to her race. Mary being reminded that she must sit in the back of the court room, again because of her race. Katherine runs across campus just to find a bathroom that she is allowed to use and never once complaining about it until she is publicly berated about her use of time. Kevin Costner's character appears to be a generally good person who doesn't care about race, and yet still never even thought about the difficulty of being forced into a certain bathroom half a mile away. You don't need to understand the mathematics to enjoy the film, but I admit, it was fun to hear some concepts I haven't heard since my college days.The theater was almost full, with people of all ages. I was particularly happy to see some kids there, as there is much for them to take away from this film.Twice during the movie the audience broke into applause, and then applauded at the end credits as well. I don't recall the last time I heard that at a film. And most importantly - I did not see a cell phone light up the whole time - truly a miracle.",

            "content": "Appreciation. It's a condition which requires information and understanding and results in increased compassion, acceptance and inclusiveness. There are few ways to enhance appreciation for others more effectively than a well-made movie and the 2016 historical drama \"Hidden Figures\" (PG, 2:07) takes full advantage of that opportunity. Without being too busy or too preachy, this film helps the audience better appreciate the struggles of being a minority \u2013 and a working woman (and even a mother working outside the home) \u2013 in the early 1960s, the pressure involved in competing with the Soviet Union in the early years of the space race, the difficult challenges surrounding getting man into space (and returning him safely to earth) for the first time and the courage it required of those who were willing to go. That's a lot for one movie \u2013 and might be too much for many \u2013 but \"Hidden Figures\" is up to the challenge.The film is an adaptation of Margot Lee Shetterly's book of the same name and follows three black women who worked in NASA's computer section in 1961. That's not to say that they worked on computers \u2013 THEY were the computers. Back when electronic computers (with only a fraction of the capacity and speed of today's mainframes) took up an entire room \u2013 and were just beginning to be installed in places like NASA \u2013 talented mathematicians did calculations for the space program by hand.Dorothy Vaughn (Oscar winner Octavia Spencer) is a mathematician who is also mechanically-inclined, develops a talent for programming IBM computers and is a natural leader, but is denied a well-deserved supervisory position by NASA culture \u2013 and her supervisor (Kirsten Dunst). Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) is a brilliant mathematician who struggles to balance the demands of her increasing responsibilities at NASA with caring for her three young daughters whose father has passed away. Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) is an outspoken aspiring engineer who is held back from becoming an actual engineer because of her lack of education, which she has difficulty overcoming because of segregation.All three women make progress in their attempts to reach their goals and fulfill their potential, but with much difficulty, based on their gender and their race. Dorothy has been managing the women of the computer section for some time, but has to fight for the title and the pay \u2013 and even takes it upon herself to learn more about NASA's newly-arrived IBM computer, while understanding that doing so could eventually cost her and her co-workers their jobs. Mary continues to make valuable contributions to NASA's efforts, while trying to work through the catch-22 of needing additional education to become an engineer, with the only nearby school offering such classes refusing to accept any black students.But most of the screen time belongs to Katherine's story. As the most talented mathematician of all of NASA's human computers, she is called up to work in NASA's Space Task Group where she works directly with the standoffish Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) and is supervised by the group's director, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). Even as Katherine continues to demonstrate her capabilities, she is still subjected to drinking coffee from a pot labeled \"Colored\" and having to walk 20 minutes (each way) to the building where the nearest restroom for black females is located. Eventually, she earns the respect of her peers \u2013 and comes to the attention of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) himself, who comes to trust her calculations above all others. Katherine also attracts a different kind of attention from the commander of a local Army Reserve base, Lt. Col. Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali), who is also single. Embodying the dual meaning of the movie's title, Katherine works out the hidden figures needed for Glenn's mission and Jim doesn't mind that her figure is hidden beneath those unflattering 1960s dresses, as he comes to care more about her heart \u2013 and the very sharp mind hidden behind her even less flattering eye glasses.\"Hidden Figures\" is a marvelously entertaining film. The script adaptation by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi tells its true story accurately and engagingly, weaving its many story lines together seamlessly, educating and entertaining their audience throughout. Melfi also directs and uses his talented and award-worthy cast to thrill us, to make us cheer and give us moments of humor and just plain fun. I was impressed at how much this movie packed in without seeming cluttered, how much it affected me emotionally without being manipulative, and how much appreciation I gained for these women, their struggles and the importance of the times in which they lived and accomplished so much. It's also surprising that so little has been widely known about these women \u2013 until now. Don't let \"Hidden Figures\" be a hidden treasure. See it soon! It's\u0085 out of this world. \"A+\"",

            "content": "My grandson advised me to watch this movie. I'm not much of a movie watcher but was greatly impressed with the movie. I was employed by a major company in the late 60's This movie occurred a little before that. I was actually a teen when John Glen took his trip into space. I and many other blacks had no knowledge of this crew of women and how they contributed to the NASA project. In the late 60's, there were race riots and lots of racial conflicts. I remember in my senior year, Westinghouse Electric was located in a black community but had no black employees. They came to the black high schools and wanted the top 3 stenographers from each school to apply to their company. This was based on efforts from the community to hire black employees. We were tested. We all had to have 3.8-4.0 QPA's and be able to type 80-100 words per minute and transcribe at 100 wpm. I was 1 of the lucky ones. I had an academic diploma with business classes as my minor. Ten women were hired. I was so excited. But the minute I walked out on the floor, all eyes were on me. There were no black/white bathrooms, but we were pushed to the back of the line and not allowed to use the mirrors until all the white girls had left the restrooms. It wasn't a rule, but we were shoved to the back. We were laughed at and talked about in front of our faces. But under no circumstances was I going to allow somebody else to take this job away from me. We took it! We were treated like we were from a 3rd world country. The white girls didn't even know how to change the typewriter ribbons. Their typing speeds only had to be 45-50 to get in. Shucks, I had to be the best! I was awed to have typed on the IBM Selectric typewriter. The same one in the movie! But we had to care for their machines as well as our own. In high school we only had manuals. Eventually I went to Univ of Pgh. to study accounting at night. I took all of the courses required to get out of the steno pool, but was consistently turned down 10 years trying to become an Accounting Clerk. While whites with less education and less seniority were chosen over and over again over me. I had to type for the controller, because of my super fast, error free statistical typing skills while his secretary filed her nails and poured coffee. Of course, I was never paid what she made. To make a long story short, we black women stayed. Some of us for 40 years. It took years before we were looked at like humans--before people would talk to us, eat at the same lunch table, sometimes they would make us wait last to get on the elevators to go home. But over the course of 10- 40 years, we earned that respect. We did become manager secretaries. We did earn engineering degrees at night and worked our way up. We did end up with white women becoming our best friends. We became their bridesmaids instead of their maids. We went to their parties, instead of cleaning up after the parties. This movie may make some people uncomfortable, and perhaps you don't believe it was like that for smart black women, actually any black person. But believe me, I am a living witness at age 67 to recall the bigotry and hatred I once experienced as a young woman 18 years old, only to retire from the company with much respect. Many of my friends that started when I started, are still in touch. We always laugh and say \"We were the first.\" Because we knocked down those walls of prejudice and differences and created a path for people of all colors to follow. I loved the movie. I only wished that those women had been recognized a little sooner for their contributions to the NASA PROJECT. The portrayal of bigotry and indifference is real. It really did happen in the 60's. As a child I remember the black/white bathrooms--not being allowed in Howard Johnson's on the turnpike and going shopping in the department store via the back warehouse door. Katherine was older than me. Did she run almost a mile to the bathroom? Maybe, maybe not. But don't judge this movie based on that. Some real prejudices were worse than that. History cannot be changed, only learned about. I am proud to be a part of that growing history along with Katherine.",

            "content": "First I would like to say that I thought this was a tremendous movie. It is well written, acted, directed, and the story is amazingly compelling. Then I read a bit about the true story of these amazing women. There were such great liberties taken with their stories that I was a bit appalled. While it did a great job making us feel just how amazing these women were it failed to show the role NASA played correctly. I will simply paste the wiki of the reality of the mindset of NASA as well as the real story, in a super condensed way. Science is anti-stupidity and racism is stupid. I wish that NASA and science had been presented in a bit better light. Paste starts here:The film, set at NASA in 1961, depicts segregated facilities such as the West Area Computing unit, an all-black group of female mathematicians, who were originally required to use separate dining and bathroom facilities. However, in reality, Dorothy Vaughan was promoted to supervisor of West Computing in 1949, becoming the first black supervisor at the NACA and one of the few female supervisors. In 1958, when the NACA made the transition to NASA, segregated facilities, including the West Computing office, were abolished. Dorothy Vaughan and many of the former West Computers transferred to the new Analysis and Computation Division (ACD), a racially and gender-integrated group.Mary Jackson completed her engineering courses and earned a promotion to engineer in 1958, becoming NASA's first black female engineer. Katherine Johnson was assigned to the Flight Research Division in 1953, a move that soon became permanent. When the Space Task Group was formed in 1958, engineers from the Flight Research Division formed the core of the Group and Katherine moved along with them. She coauthored a research report in 1960, the first time a woman in the Flight Research Division had received credit as an author of a research report. The Space Task Group was led by Robert Gilruth, not Al Harrison, who was created to simplify a more complex management structure. Vivian Mitchell and Paul Stafford are composites of several team members reflecting common social views and attitudes of the time. Karl Zielinski is based on Mary Jackson's mentor Kazimierz \"Kaz\" Czarnecki. John Glenn, who was much older than depicted at the time of launch, did ask specifically for Johnson to verify the IBM calculations, although she had several days before the launch date to complete the process.",

            "content": "This is one of those \"based on true events\" films that the moment you return from the theater you're going to hop on the internet and explore the story. That's a good sigh. Unfortunately, here the need to do some fact checking might not stem from all the right reasons.Hidden Figures is an upbeat, inspiring tale about the role three African-American women played in the NASA program during the early 60's. First Katherine Johnson (Henson), our lead, a gifted mathematician and human computer trying to carve out a roll in the Space Test Group. Second, Dorothy Vaughan (Spencer), leader of the \"colored computers.\" She wants both the supervisor title she deserves and to survive the transition to IBM's mechanical computers. Finally Mary Jackson (Monae), who is trying to overcome discriminatory policies to become NASA's first female engineer. These women must meet challenges in the workplace then return home to more struggles African-Americans were fighting nationwide. Having the performances to anchor your character drama goes along way. Henson is solid, but Spencer is Oscar worthy and Monae's performance is part of a spectacular 2016. I will be on the lookout for more from this talent. Kudos to the supporting roles played by Ali and Costner. Beyond the highlight performances, the scenario is well worth a shot. We have seen heroes fighting against segregation. We have seen space race movies. The mix presents America at its finest and most appalling. A cute combo. The woman at the core are also very deserving of a chance in the sun. The problems creep in with presentation. The director/writer Melfi and co-writer Schroeder were clearly unsatisfied with the quiet, real nobility with which these woman conducted themselves. I cannot say if what the creators did is ethical, but the addition of obviously manufactured drama was a damning decision. This leads to some awkward trust issues. After watching some Hollywood like Johnson erupting at her boss's boss, it becomes more difficult to believe in the little things. Did Johnson really need to run a half a mile just to use the restroom? Or even the climax. On the day of the launch, did John Glenn trust Johnson's calculations over the IBM? It turns out only one of these inclusions are factual. Not the one you think, and perhaps the true story demonstrates more bravery. I'm not going to share any more of my digging here. Others asked the same questions and the answers are readily available. The point is after I watched Hidden Figures I wanted to learn if I had been lied too. Sad, because doubts are not what stories this wonderful deserve. Beyond this major stumble, Hidden Figures is well worth anyone's time. Educational, but entertaining. Positive without preachy. Family friendly in a genuine way. At the theater, I sat next to a nineish year old who kept asking her mother questions. The daughter was interested and wanted to follow every detail. The mother gave brisk answers not wanting to miss a moment. That's a true event, I swear, and the best praise for Hidden Figures I can muster.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed watching Hidden Figures. The story was compelling and laid out neatly for our viewing pleasure. It shone a spotlight on a part of history with which I wasn't familiar. And, most importantly, it made me want to learn more about Katherine Goble Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan. What a shame the screenwriters felt they had to preach at me about racism rather than just tell the true story of these amazing and talented women. They weren't amazing and talented \"in spite\" of being black or \"in spite\" of being women, they were just amazing and talented in their own right. One day, perhaps, Hollywood will get a clue and give audiences credit for having a brain.Much of the atmosphere of racism in the movie did not ring true for me. In many cases it didn't even make sense, so I looked into it. The first question I had for the internet was \"Did Katherine Goble have to run half a mile to use a bathroom on the NASA complex?\" The answer is no. For more info on the conditions and life of Katherine Johnson check out the interview with her here: https://youtu.be/r8gJqKyIGhE. In particular check out 11:49 where she says she \"didn't feel segregation\". Everyone was working. The job was important and they weren't going to jeopardize the mission with foolish racist antics. She was part of a team. I would've liked to have heard so much more about Katherine and her mind and work, less about the social issues of the 1960s! I understand screenwriters have to condense a large amount of information into a couple of hours but the ham-handed and, let's be honest, false representation of racism at NASA and the treatment of these women was a repeated and unwelcome intrusion into what should have been a very interesting and educational movie about such remarkable women. For example: I strongly suspect Katherine Goble never, ever would have been so unprofessional as to scream at her boss and co-workers like she does in what Hollywood probably sees as a \"cathartic\" scene. It was completely out of character and a distraction from what should have been the real story, that of Katherine's accomplishments. Goble was a conscientious and intelligent woman who would've never done such a thing which, to my way of thinking, says a lot more about her than this silly, manufactured scene. But I don't want to run the risk of being just as ham-handed in my review and I'll leave my criticism at that. I'll only add, don't let the prospect of being bludgeoned by an anti-racism message keep you from going to see Hidden Figures.",

            "content": "Wanted to see as many 2016 films as possible, especially those that won or were nominated for the big awards. 'Hidden Figures' also had the further interest on being based on an incredible true story, with just as incredible people, set during a very interesting and still hard-hitting period of history.'Hidden Figures' was one of the best-received films of the year critically and it is not hard to see why. Not saying that it's perfect or one of my favourites of all time, and it won't work, and has not worked, for everybody. Can definitely see the criticisms directed against it, or at least a few of them. There are a lot of exceptional elements here too that make it an illuminating and entertaining film that is hard to dislike regardless of any factual inaccuracies and distortions. The film is very well made, beautifully shot with the 60s setting recreated and evoked expertly. The direction keeps things moving while giving some breathing space, allowing the character interaction and situations to shine through (and shine through they do) and making the most of the story and period. The music is a dynamic fit. Particularly good here are the performances, with Octavia Spencer and especially Taraji P. Henson giving two of the year's best performances. Kirsten Dunst is given her meatiest material in years and her performance is one of her best, likewise with Kevin Costner. The three lead characters are ones you root for all the way, ones you laugh with, are moved by and are inspired by. Katherine in particular. Much of the script sparkles in sharpness, wit and insight. Parts are amusingly absurd which provides a levity that stops the film from becoming overly-serious. Parts make one reach for the tissues. Parts make one angry in a way that is appropriate. And throughout a great job is done honouring these characters while not making them complete saints. Not everything works. The colleague characters, though acted very well, are nowhere near as interesting or well developed. They are instead too one-dimensional and pat, with only Costner's character showing a glimpse of any kind of an open mind. It does get a little heavy-handed, a hard trap to avoid with the subject matter and period and credit is due not trivialising segregation. Especially true in most of the characterisation being too neat, parts that are a little preachy and the coloured bathroom running gag getting a little repetitive. Personally wouldn't call 'Hidden Figures' offensive, more that subtlety isn't a strong suit.Overall, very well done, not a film to remain hidden and does inspire to read more about the story, the characters and the period. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Why this has not been known for many, many years - that is a sad state. Thank heaven the daughter wrote the book and these women will have the credit they so deserved. A good showing of the discrimination shown the black people in the 60's - it was well represented but the story took front page. I love these women - they were mothers, wives and eventually recognized as experts in their field of math and coding. I grew up in the late 50 and 60's - so impressive that the three did not let anything hold them back. They did it quietly and with respected results - but this story should have been told in the 60's. The acting is excellent, the sets are so believable, the culture is there - thank you Theodore Malfi for a an entertaining and educational film. And Pharrell for the music.",

            "content": "Not knowing what to expect, I checked out to see how the story of three female individuals made a difference at NASA back in 1961. I've witnessed in past historical dramas of where racism included violence, but that is not the case regarding Hidden Figures. Rather it focused more on how it was overcome in casual, everyday life (especially the workplace).The story revolves around three brilliant African-American women by the names of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson as they live their lives working at NASA among a nearly all-white staff. Despite segregation still circulating at the time, each of them proved that no matter what color they were, it's their intellect and willpower that got them through each obstacle of the day and also helped make history for astronaut John Glenn to be the first American astronaut to completely orbit the Earth.With an interesting balance of wit and drama, I found its tribulations to be the main focus. Since the movie was based on true events, to me it felt like a wonderful tie-in to the 2014 drama \"Selma\" since that too revolved around a time when people marched to spread the word of ending segregation. But unlike Selma where black people and Dr. Martin Luther King fought for the right to vote, Hidden Figures tackled both the obstacles of racism and even sexism in of all places NASA. It was very jarring to see that despite the characters' extensive knowledge in their work and upon receiving their own respective degrees in their studies, it's still looked down upon by the self- righteous higher-ups. Taraji P. Henson (Empire) sure brought out a splendid performance as mathematician Katherine Johnson. Likewise for her costars Octavia Spencer (The Help) and Janelle Monae as they helped balance the drama, including sass to boot. Kevin Costner and 'Big Bang Theory' star Jim Parsons also helped give some depth (though I wouldn't call them antagonists) in these women's lives.Personally, I enjoyed the events that unfolded overall. When it came to the racial undertones and confrontations in a few scenes, myself and a few others in the theater old or young were left curious and appalled at the same time by how this was a thing in the 1960s compared to the present. It's sure to go far with various accolades.The moral: If you put your mind to it, things can be accomplished no matter how many would say otherwise.",

Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) are three black women working at NASA where they face certain segregation issues. When Russia gets a man into space, the U.S. kick it up a gear and Katharine is selected to help due to her math skills and soon all three women are breaking new ground.HIDDEN FIGURES tells a true story and the title certainly fits because I'm going to guess that a lot of people weren't aware of who these three women were. Everything a film comes out that is based on a true story some people break out the tired \"it isn't 100% accurate\" debates. Well, this movie isn't a documentary. It's a docu-drama so it's obvious that certainly things are going to be altered for dramatic purposes so attacking the film for changing a few things is just silly.As far as the film goes, it's certainly a crowd-pleaser as you get a terrific story, three strong women to look up to and of course some great performances. The performances are certainly the key to the film's success because the screenplay offers up all three characters a lot of development and thankfully the actors pull off their parts. Henson certainly deserved an Oscar-nomination that was robbed by Meryl Streep. She certainly gives one of the best, the strongest and one of the most emotionally powerful performances of the year. I'm willing to bet years from now her performance will still be remembered while Streep's is forgotten.The supporting cast is terrific as well with Spencer once again delivering a very good performance in the role of a woman who pretty much allows herself to walked over until she sees what standing up can do. Monae is also wonderful in her supporting bit and offers up some much needed comedy relief. Kirsten Dunst is also very good in her role as an obvious racist. Then you've got Kevin Costner offering up his strongest performance in years as Katharine's boss who is willing to break rules to get the job done.HIDDEN FIGURES is technically very impressive with a rousing score, some great cinematography and plenty of nice direction throughout. If you're a fan of mainstream movies meant to make you stand up a cheer then you've got a winner here.",

Directed by Theodore Melfi and stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Kevin Costner and Kirstin Dunst, Hidden Figures would be a good film had it not been so concerned with the idea of the empowerment of women that it forgot to be a good, engaging film. It has the proper ingredients to become a heavy hitter but trades it in using its excellent cast as more of a political statement than anything else.The film starts off by introducing us to Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson (Henson, Spencer and Janelle Mo\u00e0ne) in almost the exact same ways. We see that Katherine is a number cruncher and a brilliant woman all around...then the exact same character traits are rehashed for Spencer and Mo\u00e0ne's characters. There is nothing different between the women, there are 3 of the same character in one film. The only difference between the three is Taraji P. Henson's excellent performance that makes her thoroughly enjoyable throughout a film that would have been a direct-to-digital film otherwise. The film does very little to give any development to these women and keeps drowning us in the notion that \"this is girl power.\" It became extremely redundant after awhile and left me waiting for the film to get serious but it never did. This is a film that is more about what the characters did rather than how and why they did it.Overall, Hidden Figures is a bland film with paper thin characters that tries to make more of a political statement rather than make a good film. This is a perfect example of political climate affecting creative endeavors. If there were anything I could say it is: if you're going to see the film, see it for no other reason than Taraji P. Henson's excellent performance. Taking her out of this film in any way, shape or form would have probably stopped this film in the development process but then again, maybe that is where this should have stayed.",

When a movie is talked about as much as this and in such a positive light it is difficult for it to live up to the hype, usually. This one came close. I will admit this wasn't really what I expected though. I really expected this to focus more on the racial tensions that the women went though. While that did play a large part in this it seemed that that aspect was an afterthought. I'm not saying that's a bad thing though. The movie seemed to focus more on Johnson and the others proving themselves through her job to the point of being needed, regardless of gender or skin color. That is a lesson everyone needs to learn.

            "content": "A necessary reminder of days gone by and why resentment still lingers. It's 1961 in one of those bureaucratic offices in the NASA research center at Langley, Virginia. Since it's 1961 in Virginia, all the facilities are segregated by law, including office buildings, rest rooms, and drinking fountains. Well, there are about two dozen African-American ladies who are more than usually smart and serve as \"computers\" -- ie., human beings who do math by hand -- and their African-American supervisor is the cooperative and relatively restrained Olivia Spencer. Their immediate boss is the very polite, very Southern, very racist Kirsten Dunst, whose name means \"haze\" in German. (I just threw that in because I had to learn it in a painful German class and saw no reason why you shouldn't suffer a little too over the word. Now we both know, and you've paid the lesser price, believe me.) Where was I? Yes, in 1961 NASA didn't even have the most elementary of technical facilities and these ladies are really math whizzes -- one especially, Taraji P. Henson, is even more knowing than the rest and is recruited by the director, Kevin Costner, into the sanctum sanctorum of the board room, which she enter boldly, where no \"Negro\" has gone before. The all-white male staff don't greet her. They simply stare in disbelief. Casting has made the right choices in all cases. None of the ladies is a glamour girl, although I wouldn't have minded Beyonc\u00e9 in a prominent role, come to think of it. Costner, however, is indifferent to the staff's response, just as he's indifferent to the indignities these human computers are suffering. As one of the ladies puts it, \"He only thinks about numbers.\" So naturally when Costner chews out Henson for so often being out of the office, she shoots back with a couple of reasons why: the rest rooms in the building are segregated, and when she has to visit the bathroom she must run to the nearest colored bathroom in a building a quarter of a mile away, rain or shine. Costner take a crowbar to the \"Whites Only\" bathroom and demolishes it. The Russians are ahead of us in the space race, so let's not leave our desks any more than we have to, and by the way, let's work late without pay. And no more of this racist stuff.The film goes on to trumpet the very real talents and achievements of Taraji Henson and the rest, along with all the indignities imposed on them. For many Americans, the indignities are the stuff of history but it wasn't all that long ago. I remember hitch-hiking north on US 40 and encountering colored and white rest rooms at all the stops, well into Maryland. We needed this reminder. That kind of \"racist stuff\" is behind us now, thank God, but the sentiments persist in some quarters.Therein lies the chief problem with this movie. I'll have to shed my PC mantle for a few minutes. The movie is buffed to a high sheen. The whites are all either prejudiced or, at best, sullen or indifferent, with John Glenn a notable exception. The blacks are uniformly good -- indignant but well behaved, except for one or two thoroughly justified outbursts that are necessary to capture the attention of the white guys. The story lacks subtlety. And further I don't need to be preached to or taught a lesson because I'm already a member of the choir. The few scenes that are nuanced stand out like a gastropod on its poduncle. Here's one such scene. Towards the end, when the ladies have proved their value, Olivia Spencer and her nemesis Kirsten Dunst find themselves alone in the now-integrated ladies' room. Dunst approaches the ever-smiling Spencer and assures her that she, Dunst, is not really prejudiced against black, regardless of what Spencer might think, \"please believe me.\" Still smiling politely, Spencer replies, \"Yes. I really believe that you think that.\" How desperately the movie needs more such scenes.There's another irritating weakness too. A lot of time is given over to Tararji Henson's budding romance and ultimate marriage to a black colonel in the U.S. Army. It's all there -- the widowhood, the four charming children, the occasional misunderstanding, the declamation of undying love, the transfer of the mother's wedding ring at the birthday party, the tears of happiness. My God, it's Lifetime Movie Network!I've now gotten the bad stuff out of the way and can say that the movie is well worth watching for any number of reasons. Math wizards are always fascinating anyway. It's a special talent that shows up early in childhood and is later heavily impacted by training, so it's hard to separate the inherited talent from the knowledge picked up in a calculus class. It's not a talent measured on any of the most commonly used intelligence tests, which dismiss it as a mere \"aptitude\", like musical ability. Shame on the psychometrists.Anyway, you won't regret seeing it.",

With that said, it still is interesting to see what went on and how they strove for dignity and acceptance in the face of racial prejudice. Of course, NASA was (is) in the South, so hanging over everything are all the things that those who simply lived normal lives had to deal with. I understand that the whole thing with running to the bathroom was fiction. But it made a point. The writing on the blackboard and standing on a ladder is visual, but it was more likely done in notebooks or on pieces of paper. Did an entire group of these women march into the IBM computer room and take over? Probably not en masse. But I gave it a nine because it was a hallmark in showing us what these ladies, who were every bit as competent as their white counterparts, had to do to get respect. The movie is touching and exciting. I was pleased to see the events surrounding John Glenn's historic flight. I remember as a high school kid, how much we feared for his fate.

Since the Civil Rights movement was only beginning, and NASA was located in southern regions of the US, these women were subject to legal discrimination. \"Hidden Figures\" follows the careers of some of these women. But it does this in a heavy-handed, formulaic way.Ever since \"The Ugly Duckling\" of Hans Christian Anderson, the formula has been predictable: a member of a despised minority is grudgingly admitted into a previously exclusive activity. Will the minority figure excel in the new position, or will he/she fail miserably, justifying the prejudices of the ruling class? Telling you the answer would be a spoiler, so you'll have to guess it for yourselves, but it's not too difficult.In \"Hidden Figures\", all the whites are bigots (except for John Glenn and one department head), and all the blacks are hard-working, clean, patriotic moral wonders. This is history dumbed down to junior high-school level. The heroine, a mathematically gifted black widow has managed to stay chaste and raise three perfect children while handling a difficult job under trying conditions. The other characters are no more believable.The period detail is mostly well done, with electric typewriters and glass-knobbed coffee percolators. But in the early '60s, all engineers would have carried slide rules, the way doctors wear stethoscopes. There are none to be seen here. Also, any time the heroine wants to work out a mathematical problem, she has to climb a ladder and write it out on a large blackboard. Scrap paper existed in the '60s.If you want to watch a simple-minded morality play rather than a movie, history reduced to the level of \"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\", then \"Hidden Figures\" is for you.",

Although that line of dialogue, as spoken by actor Kevin Costner as Harrison, is inspiring enough to have been prominently featured in the television, radio, and computer advertising for the picture, there's really nothing particularly special about Costner's delivery of the line in the movie\u2014the words are spoken with some authority, but also fairly quietly, almost conversationally, without any emphasis.And that's one of the most likable aspects of Hidden Figures, the new 20th Century-Fox/Fox 2000 motion picture about the early days of the US space program and the importance of three very special people to the project's eventual success in landing a man on the moon. NASA was during that time very much a man's domain. The story of a handful of uniquely-gifted women who were able to gain entry to that exclusive territory is inspiring enough. That some of these women were African-American during a time of segregation and oppression makes a great story even better.With the possible exception of the three women whose story it depicts, Hidden Figures is populated by characters who are sometimes flawed and eccentric or motivated by their own narrow personal agendas, but united in a mission to navigate the impossible, and in the process invent an entirely new branch of science.In this way, Hidden Figures is refreshingly a movie about integration and civil rights in which integration and civil rights are almost\u2014but not quite\u2014secondary to a crackerjack story about exceptional people during exceptional times.Katherine Goble, played by Taraji P. Henson, is an intellectual prodigy whom since childhood has grasped advanced theoretical mathematical concepts as if God Himself were her tutor. A shy, reserved, and bespectacled widow and mother of three, Henson plays the role as if segregation is an unfortunate and irritating inconvenience which only serves to distract her from her primary scientific passion.Mary Jackson, played by model and recording artist Janelle Monae, is a research mathematician and physical scientist who yearns for an education in engineering. The mother of two and married to a civil rights activist, Mary is more career-oriented, determined and irreverently outspoken than her friend Katherine\u2014the word sassy springs to mind. Unable to pursue her educational degree in a state where scholastic segregation is still legal, Mary ultimately takes her ambitions into a courtroom and challenges the law.Dorothy Vaughn, portrayed by the wonderful Octavia Spencer, is the most philosophically-canny of the three friends, seemingly willing to compromise with segregation for as long as it doesn't interrupt her plans or career path. A mathematician assigned because of her gender and race to a secretarial pool, Dorothy finally employs subterfuge, and even a humorous little piece of larceny, as a means of gaining the information she needs to operate the new room-sized IBM computer NASA's experts don't even know how to turn on.Registering the most impact among the supporting characters is Kevin Costner as Al Harrison. As played by Costner, Harrison is so consumed and obsessed with his mission of placing an American into space that he's virtually oblivious to the world and society which surrounds him. A consummate professional, the gruff, humorless Harrison needs the best scientists in the country to help him invent the new science required of his mission\u0085no matter their color. Harrison is a fictional character, an amalgamation of several different NASA administrators, and Costner plays him perfectly.Also notable is actor Glen Powell as astronaut John Glenn. Although he does not bear even the slightest resemblance to the astronaut, Powell easily captures Glenn's million-megawatt charisma and charm. When the IBM computer's trajectory figures appear shaky, Glenn insists Goble personally\u2014he calls her \"the smart girl,\" the cardinal plaudit in Glenn's vocabulary\u2014check the numbers before he climbs onto the rocket for his launch into history. It's a charming, little-known detail to an American legend, and it's absolutely true.Theodore Melfi guides Hidden Figures with a loose and relaxed hand, wisely allowing the story to unfold naturally, in its own time. He essentially lets the story to speak for itself. While the viewer never gets the sense that actual historical events are unfolding on screen, it's a consummately agreeable history lesson. is so fascinating to others.Hidden Figures takes more than a few liberties with the facts, but the filmmakers will be quick to point out that the picture is not a documentary\u2014the words projected on screen at the beginning of the movie read, \"Based on a True Story.\" As Americans, we sometimes seem to hobble ourselves, and move forward only with great reluctance and deliberation. And even accounting for the progress we achieve, often after a period of enlightenment we take a step or two backward and build walls of mistrust instead of bridges of understanding.While Hidden Figures is being described accurately as a \"feel-good picture,\" at the time of the historic space mission of John Glenn which concludes the picture, the fire hoses and police attack dogs shamefully used during the historic civil rights demonstrations of Selma and Birmingham were still a year or so in the future.So as we're patting ourselves on the back and congratulating ourselves on how far we've traveled since that time in the early 1960s when Kevin Costner's character in Hidden Figures tells his newly integrated staff \"We get there together or we don't get there at all,\" we might also want to be mindful of how far we still need to go.",

Did the director really need to portray every white person, bar two, as vigorously racist or anti-women, even though virtually all the characters are clearly intelligent and from well educated backgrounds? This is a film where the message would have been stronger and more credible if a degree of balance and subtlety had been added to the mix.

            "content": "This absolutely fantastic film will inspire so many people to never give up on their dreams and talents. It shows that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.The movie takes place in the 1960s where sexism and racial discrimination is still at a high. There is fear of the Soviet Union since they already have the technology to send astronauts into space, though there is still hope for America. This is a true story which revolves around three extremely intelligent African-American women - Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) and Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) who all work for the NASA program. They are the brains behind the launch of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell). The woman struggle with using their brilliance since they live in a world where the color of their skin defines who they are and who they are not going to be.The acting is fabulous! Taraji P. Henson is made to play Katherine Johnson. Taraji highlights the braveness and intelligence of her character, adding a bit of a quirky side as well. I feel that I know her character like a friend. Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) is my favorite character out of them all. She has this determination in her that is mind blowing. She can be very serious at times, but one of the most hilarious people at others. Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) definitely takes on the leader role. When watching this film you feel for her struggles and want her to succeed so badly. Octavia brings boldness and sarcasm that just makes you adore her. I felt the strong friendship between these woman.I could tell how much time was spent in designing the set and costumes. The sets are so realistic that I felt transformed into that time period. I loved looking at the small details added to each set. Renee Ehrlich Kalfus designed the costumes which are so colorful and suit each character perfectly. It is so interesting to see how different the clothes were back then. The costumes helped add to it being the 60s.My favorite scene is when Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) breaks down the colored woman's bathroom sign to show that everyone can share the same restroom. Al Harrison is the head of the NASA launch program. This is my favorite scene because I loved seeing someone who looked beyond the color of people's skin.The main message of this film is to never give up on your dreams, even when people tell you that you can't. The three woman look beyond their gender and their skin color. They look at the talents they have. One example of this is when Katherine Johnson is talking to Jim Johnson. Jim is surprised as to why they are having a woman do such important things at NASA. Katherine retorts with an inspiring line \"Yes they let women do some things at NASA Mister Johnson. And it's not because we wear skirts. It's because we wear glasses!\" I recommend this film for ages 9 to 18. The younger audiences will enjoy learning about the past and be inspired to shoot for the stars. The older audiences will like the comedy and the amazing story. I give this film a 5 out of 5 astronaut stars.Reviewed by Talia J., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org.",

            "content": "In 1961, three Black female geniuses ( Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson) work for NASA. We can tell it's 1961 by the ubiquitous pictures of JFK. The three work as human computers doing calculations.Katherine is a mathematician who is basically Einstein without the crazy hairdo. Mean White people are mean to her. They mistake her for a janitor, make her drink coffee from a separate pot, and worst of all, force her to walk half a mile in the rain while carrying a bunch of folders, just to go pee.\nSheldon from The Big Bang Theory is particularly mean to Katherine. He's always trying to take credit for her work. Katherine is clearly the smartest person in all of NASA.\nKevin Costner is Katherine's boss, who destroys the colored bathroom sign, thus freeing up her genius and enabling her to get John Glenn into orbit. John Glenn was in his forties at that time, but the actor playing him looks like Scut Farkas from A Christmas Story. NASA probably would've had to shut down if it wasn't for Katherine. Sheldon ends up subjugated to Katherine and serving her coffee.Dorothy is a mechanical genius who can fix cars just by magically touching the engine with a screwdriver. Kirsten Dunst is mean to Dorothy, and won't let her get a promotion. When NASA gets a new computer, (that is too big to fit through the door), the White doofus programmers don't have a clue how to get the thing to work. Dorothy can get the computer functioning just by magically touching a wire. Dorothy gets promoted to supervisor and gets to act sanctimonious towards Kirsten Dunst. Dorothy is clearly the second smartest person at NASA.Mary is an engineering genius who can't get promoted to engineer because of mean White people. She has to go to court to fight for the right to go to engineering school. The mean White judge really doesn't want to allow her admission into the school, but Mary wins him over with sassy Black girl attitude. I believe she later went on to invent the internet. Mary is clearly the third smartest person at NASA.Hidden Figures is a plodding, predictable, Howard Zinnesque soap opera of Whites oppressing Blacks, which is mostly fictitious. The three women really existed and really did work at NASA. But all they did was work in groups doing tedious calculations in pre computer times. Katherine Johnson stated that she was treated well and didn't face any discrimination. This film is nothing more than post \"Oscar so White\" agitprop. It would almost work as an absurdist comedy if it's intentions weren't so deplorable.Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past. -George Orwell",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. The space program has created many iconic images over the years: rhesus monkeys in space suits, the Mercury 7 Astronauts press conference, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin erecting a flag on the moon, and numerous Space Shuttle missions \u2013 some successful, others quite tragic. We've even been privy to cameras inside the space station and the NASA control center. Despite all of that, director Theodore Melfi's (St Vincent, 2014) latest film uncovers a part of history to which most of us knew nothing of.Adapted from the book by Margot Lee Shetterly, the film stuns us with the story of the \"Colored Computers\" \u0085 the African-American female mathematicians who manually checked and cross-checked the endless calculations, formulas and theories required to launch a rocket into space and bring it (and the astronaut) back home. It's a crowd-pleasing history lesson and an overdue tribute to, and celebration of, three intelligent women of color who played crucial roles in the success of the American space program We first meet a young Katherine Johnson as a child math prodigy whose school can't provide her the challenge she needs. Next we see her as a bespectacled adult (Taraji P Henson) on the side of the road beside a broken down car with her friends and co-workers Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (musician Janelle Monea). They are on their way to work at Langley in the computing department. Dorothy is the ad hoc supervisor of the group and is in a non-stop battle for the title and increased pay that comes with the job. Mary is the razor-tongued one who is striving to overcome all of the obstacles on her way to becoming the first female African American Engineer at NASA. These are good friends and smart women caught up in the racism and sexism of the times and of the organization for which they work.Soon, Katherine is promoted to the Space Task Group run by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). This is a group of true rocket scientists, and Katherine is charged with checking and confirming their work \u0085 a thankless job for anyone, but especially for a black woman in the early 1960's. Her supervisor (Jim Parsons) refuses to give her the necessary security clearance \u2013 huge portions of the work are redacted, making it increasingly difficult for Katherine to run the numbers. This is a seemingly accurate and grounded portrayal of racism in the workplace. At the time, racism and sexism were mostly woven into the fabric of society \u0085 it's \"just the way things are\". It's almost a passive-aggressive environment with separate coffee pots and restrooms clear across campus.There are numerous sub-plots \u2013 probably too many. We even get an underdeveloped romance between Katherine and a soldier named Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali, so great in this year's Moonlight). We follow Mary as she goes to court in pursuit of the right to attend the college that offers the engineering courses required for her certification. We see Dorothy with her kids, as well as her ongoing head-butting with her condescending supervisor (Kristen Dunst), who claims to have nothing against 'you people'. Dorothy's response is clever, crowd-pleasing and a reminder that this is an air-brushed version of reality \u0085 but also a view that we rarely see. As the Mercury Project progresses, we see how Harrison (Costner) is so focused on getting the job done, that he is oblivious to the extra challenges faced by Katherine \u2013 that is until her emotions erupt in a scene that will have Henson under Oscar consideration.The slow implementation of the first IBM mainframe is important not just to NASA, but also to Dorothy and her team. They see the future and immediately start self-training on Fortran so that they are positioned for the new world, rather than being left behind. Eye-opening sequences like this are contrasted with slick mainstream aspects like no slide-rules (not very camera friendly, I guess), stylish and expensive clothing for the underpaid women, and a steady parade of sparkling classic cars in vibrant colors \u2013 no mud or dents in sight. Sure, these are minor qualms, but it's these types of details that distract from the important stories and messages.The film does a nice job of capturing the national pride inspired by the Mercury project, and astronauts such as John Glenn (played here by Glen Powell, Everybody Wants Some!!). It even works in some actual clips and captures the pressure brought on by the race to space versus the Russians. There is an interesting blend of Hans Zimmer's score and the music of Pharrell Williams that gives the film a somewhat contemporary feel despite being firmly planted in the 60's. This mostly unknown story of these women is clearly about heroes fighting the daily battles while maintaining exemplary self-control. It offers a positive, upbeat and inspirational message \u0085 believe in yourself, and don't pre-judge others. Don't miss the photos over the closing credits, and don't hesitate to take the family to the theatre over the holidays.",

Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughan who quickly learns to program the new IBM computers, yet she is not allowed to borrow advanced books from the local library and Janelle Monae plays Mary Jackson who strives to be accepted at an accredited all white college so she can become an aerospace engineer.The women just encounter indifference at NASA given various tasks but thing come to a head when Katherine is promoted to work with a core group of scientists and mathematicians who want to send the first man to space until they are beaten to it by the Soviets. They work under fair but firm disciplinarian Al Harrison (Kevin Costner.)However even amongst this elite group she encounters prejudice, she is not regarded to be up to the task, belittled and even ignored. She even has to use her own separate kettle as the main one is for whites only and of course she has walk half a mile to use the blacks only toilet which is in another section of NASA.So here is an example of why I found this film to be infuriatingly hokey. Harrison would constantly come out of his office and asks for Katherine but she is never there and no one answers him where she is. The reason for her whereabouts is that she has gone to the blacks only toilet. This seemingly goes on for months until one day Harrison summons Katherine and asks her why she is never at her post and she lets loose of how she cannot use the toilet in the building and her colleagues watch in silence.The whole thing was just so bluntly done. So Harrison never noticed the blacks only kettle in the office or that the only black person in the team might encounter prejudice or wait weeks to find out why she needs to pop out for so long and also did not admonish other staff for being so insensitive or team leaders such as Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) for being prejudiced.Despite being entertaining and even inspirational I just thought Hidden Figures was so poorly written and structured.

Racism is a key component when in fact although existing in society it was not particularly bad at NASA. Maybe Hollywood had to compensate for the lack of awards for black people in 2016?

A considerable time is spent displaying the mathematician struggles going over and over to the \"colored bathroom\" and having to run for several miles.... (carrying multiple folders that unless she was going to stay in the bathroom for a week did not make any sense)..... but the complete thing is FALSE. Never happened. She actually went all the time to the white bathroom in the building she worked, and this was NEVER and issue for her or for anybody.

Henson's maths genius Katherine G. Johnson racing to the bathroom across what seems like an entire complex or Kevin Costner's kind hearted white boss Al Harrison smashing down a coloured bathroom sign with an audience watching on, feel more light-hearted than occurrences of much meaning and fail to distinguish themselves from the pack. Which means there really isn't much of substance to be found in a true life tale that has an abundance of it at its core.Focussing largely on Henson's Katherine (who often steers into an overacting zone) and her racially tense appointment to an important computer office tasked with sending America's first manned spacecraft into space, those expecting the trio that includes Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae to get amongst the action will be disappointed as they are relegated to caring friend side characters that ad very little to proceedings at all.Taking nothing away from what Johnson achieved in her time at the NASA complex, it would've been great for Melfi to pay more screen time to Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson's plights as black American woman that to achieved great things under duress and racism as it feels as though we've been short changed from their plights as Johnson gets the bulk of the important scenes.The relegation of these characters in Hidden Figures displays a glaringly obvious fault with a film that is clearly looking to be a crowd pleaser over a real memorable and moving one, which is a real shame for a story that deserves a lot more than this unfairly praised event.Final Say \u2013 Hidden Figures will make you feel good but it isn't the sum of its parts when all the critical and commercial success is bought into the equation.While this perfectly average film has its heart in a good place and has a nice glossy sheen, you can't help but feel that this Hollywoodized experience is far less heartfelt and moving than it should've been and ends up being the year's worst Best Picture entrant by a country mile.2 \u00bd bashed down bathroom signs out of 5",

Henson, Octavia Spancer, Janelle Monae, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, and Jim Parsons.The acting in this inspiring story is excellent, natural, and low key. Based on a non-fiction book by Margot Lee Shetterly, the film is about three black women who entered the space program as mathematicians. At NASA they had a dual fight - not only were they black, but they were women in a man's world. The film shows the segregation and prejudice they encountered. It also shows a world just before computers came in, with space trajectories figured out in pencil. Totally amazing. The story culminates with - what else - John Glenn's historic orbiting of the earth.Fortunately for these brilliant, ambitious, and determined women, the prejudice shown in the film was actually overdone to make the story of their accomplishments stronger. Their accomplishments were pretty darned impressive anyway.In the film, Katherine (Henson) has to walk 40 minutes to the \"colored\" bathroom until her supervisor, Harrison (Costner) finds out about it. In truth, though this is something Mary (Monae) did encounter, Katherine didn't know about a segregated bathroom and used the regular one for years. Katharine, in fact, when interviewed, said that while prejudice existed underneath, in truth, everybody was concentrated on their work.Costner's character is a mixture of different people, as is often done in films. He didn't really allow Katherine into an important meeting - she started pushing to attend them, and did, beginning in 1958. When Mary goes to court so she can attend a white school at night, this didn't happen, though the school was segregated. She requested and received an exemption. You can see that would have looked pretty unexciting on film.I don't think embellishing incidents and creating new ones that don't hurt the true story is a bad thing - the screenwriters wanted to make a point and more importantly, since it is film, do something visually. I think they could have done it without every character so totally against these women. I'm white, and having worked in many offices, I can promise you there's a Jim Parsons character in every one no matter a woman's color. Back then men resented women in positions of authority. Probably many of them still do. The purpose of true stories told in film, I feel, is to get you interested in the topic and read about it. Anyone looking for complete accuracy is going to be sadly disappointed, as I think some of the reviewers on this board were. But in the end, we still had three amazing women working in the space program - and John Glenn did in fact ask Katherine to verify the IBM calculations before his launch. Pretty darned impressive.",

I can't imagine any of these things happening just decades ago. I wonder if people were more inclusive and embraced diversity back then, perhaps science would have advanced quicker by years simply because of the inclusion of brilliant minds who were excluded because of race.",

            "content": "To answer my question brought about in the intro of this review, 'Hidden Figures' falls in the ranks of being a titan in its class. This film brings on an array of emotions throughout the duration of its run time. From delightful happiness, to laughter, to anger, and more. Overall though, it was a pure delight and feel-good film to witness and enjoy. The story is empowering to see what these three women overcame during their life and stopped at nothing to achieve what they set their minds to. For a dialogue heavy drama, I was impressed by how attention-grabbing the story of 'Hidden Figures' was. Usually, I have a tendency to lose focus on dramas but this film did such a great job at delivering a captivating performance of the story through the multitude of emotions it presented to the audience... The cast of 'Hidden Figures' all are such powerhouse performances during their respective screen time. Easily, my favorite was Taraji P. Henson, the \"star\" of the film, so to speak, all though surrounded by other equally powerful actors and actresses. Alongside of her, Kevin Costner had a great performance and very memorable one on top of it for me. If there were any negatives I can truly put together for 'Hidden Figures', it may be that I feel Janelle Mon\u00e1e's character was a bit underplayed with the screen-time given to Taraji's and Octavia's, but it was still an enjoyable performance to witness.A rightful film deserving of its 2017 Oscar nominations. 'Hidden Figures' is a delightful film to watch with a story that captivates its audience through an array of emotions. A highly recommended film from Oberrated.-- Oberrated.com --",

It is indeed hard to believe nowadays that, before the digital computer, there really was no way of, say, multiplying two numbers having many significant digits apart from using 'long multiplication' or tables of logarithms. The latter rarely went beyond 7 significant figures, leaving only long multiplication. It was not unusual to employ people simply to perform that relatively mundane task. The most famous person to do the job was Nevil Shute Norway, now known as Nevil Shute, who worked at Farnborough (a leading UK aviation research establishment). The point is that, far from being a tale of empowerment, this 'space-age' opening was simply a new form of slavery or of typist-pool routine.",

It is a thrillingly believable film about the significance of black women producing miracles at NASA during the height of racial struggle. The time is 1961, JFK was president, Martin Luther King Jr. was the man of attention in civil rights, and the rush to hurdle a man into space was central to America's thinking and desire. As the United States raced against Russia to put a man in space, NASA found untapped talent in a group of African-American female mathematicians that served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in U.S. history. Based on the unbelievably true life stories of three of these women, known as \"human computers\", we follow these women as they quickly rose the ranks of NASA alongside many of history's greatest minds specifically tasked by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) with calculating the momentous launch of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) into orbit, and guaranteeing his safe return. Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e), and Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) crossed all gender, race, and professional lines while their brilliance and desire to dream big, beyond anything ever accomplished before by the human race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true American heroes. The men in the picture include Jim Parsons (thankfully stepping out of his Big Bang character), Mahershala Ali, Aldis Hodge, as well as the white women in positions of power \u2013 Kirsten Dunst, Kimberly Quinn \u2013 all offer solid support. But this is a film about a time of transition in so many arenas, and visiting the realities of colored bathrooms, prejudice, and the fierce competition with Russia are well to remember. The film is not with out flaws (the musical score is not at all form the period, though is sounds well) and there is a little too much time spent on the social lives of these extraordinary women, but it is a film everyone should see \u2013 it is just that important to realize the major role black women played in the beginning of computers and the space program.",

The hard work culminates in John Glenn's flight on Friendship 7.This story is a great unknown American history. Sometimes, it pushes too hard on the social commentary button. It's not really necessary since the story lays it out so well. There is no need for Taraji to make that big speech. A simple proclamation of her bathroom use and the fact that she's dripping wet should be enough to allow for a great moment for Al Harrison. There is also no need for him to take down the bathroom signs in such a theatrical way. The problem with these theatrical moves is the diminishment of the inherit power of those moments. Instead of commenting on the coffee pot, somebody could later drink her coffee as a point of transformation. While it doesn't make the movie bad, it is unnecessary for this great story.",

            "content": "As a child of the early 60s, the 'Space Race', as started by John F. Kennedy in his famous speech announcing that America would put a man on the moon before the decade was out, is something that is still inherently thrilling to me. As also illustrated in many films, for example \"Pride\", and TV series, such as \"Life on Mars\", the 60s and 70s were also a world away in social terms for where we find ourselves 50 years later. Looking back today at the casual racism and sexism of that time is quite shocking. Seeing some parents bringing their child into the cinema to see \"Hidden Figures\" it made me appreciate just how alien some of the scenes on the screen would be to a child. Why would Black people only be able to use a \"colored bathroom\"? Why would a black person in a room full of white people have to drink from their own coffee pot? Why would it be so strange for a woman to hold a senior position in the organisation?This is the backdrop behind \"Hidden Figures\". It's NASA in 1962 and the race is on with the Russians to get the first person into orbit around the Earth. Getting the first person into space has already been lost after Yuri Gagarin's Vostok 1 success. But the Americans are not only struggling with the rocketry, which has a nasty habit of exploding spectacularly on the launchpad. They are also struggling with the mathematics required to successfully place a craft into orbit and, crucially, allow it to re-enter the atmosphere without burning up: America needs a successful mission, and to see a pilot with 'The Right Stuff' descending to earth in a blazing crock-pot on live TV is not part of the planned PR exercise!Enter three unexpected heroes in the form of Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson, \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\"), Dorothy Vaughn (Octavia Spencer, \"The Help\", \"Insurgent\") and May Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e, \"Moonlight\"). The three friends are all struggling in different ways at NASA's Langley Research Center to be recognised in the system that \u2013 as black women \u2013 is severely biased against them. Central to the story is Johnson, a widowed mother of two, whose maths genius becomes key to unlocking the safe return of John Glenn. The secondary stories have Jackson having to go legal to get to be the first African American engineer in NASA (unbelievable!) and Vaughn, in probably the least dramatic storyline, struggling to be recognised as a supervisor in the supervisor job she is doing. Also co-starring is man-of-the-moment Mahershala Ali as Colonel Jim Johnson, Katherine's potential new boyfriend, and Kevin Costner as Al Harrison the head of the Space Task Group. (NASA report that the film 'simplifies' the complex management chain actually in place with \"Harrison's\" character being an amalgum but most aligned to Robert C. Gilruth). It's great to see Costner back on the big screen again, and the character walks a fine line on the segregation argument: you feel the actions of the man are aligned with completing the mission rather than his own personal beliefs. Jim Parsons (\"The Big Bang Theory\") also co-stars as Johnson's spiky chauvinistic and racist supervisor as does Kirsten Dunst, in a similar role, as Vaughn's supervisor.A key mention at this point to the score by Hans Zimmer which adds greatly to the emotion of the spaceflight scenes. However, more generally in the sound area \u2013 and as a postgraduate physicist \u2013 can I just remind film-makers YET AGAIN that there is NO sound in space, so adding effects to booster separations and \"whooshings\" of spacecraft as they go by is NOT required! (You can't imagine how much I cringe at these moments).This is ultimately a film about girl empowerment and black empowerment, so it is not surprising that all of the women in my life have gone gaga about this film. As somebody completely outside of that particular Venn diagram, I found the film to be a solid and respectful telling of a true story that should have been known a long time ago. Was it as gripping and exciting as \"Apollo 13\"? No, not in my view. But as an educational missive aimed at that \u2013 presumably perplexed \u2013 young child in my screening, this is a timely reminder for the present political system as to how far the world has come in fifty years, and how we must NEVER retreat down that road again.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",

Henson (The Karate Kid (2010), TVs Person of Interest) stars as Katherine G. Johnson one of several African-American women 'human computers' employed by NASA in the space race between the US and Russia.With her friends Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer: The Help, Being John Malkovich), their unofficial supervisor, and Mary Jackson (musical recording artist, actress and model Janelle Mon\u00e1e: Friends with Benefits, The Equalizer), who desperately wants to apply to become an engineer, they have to deal with segregation, racial and sexual bias. Although Dorothy is fulfilling the role of supervisor, she is not given the title nor the pay she is entitled to and her boss, Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst: Wimbledon, Spider-Man trilogy) seems unwilling to even discuss the discrepancy.When Katherine is reassigned to help The Space Task Group, led by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner: Dances with Wolves, Field of Dreams), with analytic geometry, she finds prejudice even when it comes to drinking coffee and going to the bathroom. She begins to realise that being great at her job is not enough to be considered an equal as her immediate boss Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons: Garden State, TVs The Big Bang Theory) seems particularly keen to keep her out of the loop and out of meetings. She is a widow with a young family and works hard and long hours to keep her new position, with the consolation of the arrival of a new handsome man, Colonel Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali: Moonlight, TVs House of Cards) in her personal life.Mary is reassigned to the wind tunnel team, where her new boss Karl Zielinski (Olek Krupa: Burn After Reading, Salt) encourages her to enrol in a local College so that she can realise her dream of becoming an engineer. There is just one problem, the only school that offers the right course is an all-white institution and she will have to go to court to petition to attend. But nothing is going to stop her from reaching her goal, not even her husband Levi (Aldis Hodge: Straight Outta Compton, Die Hard with a Vengeance) who sees the barriers and does not want her to get hurt.Meanwhile, Dorothy has seen the arrival of the new IBM machine and knows that this will lead to a future that will leave them all without jobs, so she sets about learning all she can to become a programmer.All three ladies work hard to help realise the NASA dream of getting John Glenn (Glen Powell: The Dark Knight Rises, The Expendables 3) into orbit and back to earth safely.With excellent performances all round, this film shows us a fascinating insight into the history of not only the difficult challenges of getting a man into space, but the struggles minority women had to face working back then. Set in 1961, we follow the lives of the three women working as human 'computers.' The film is never preachy and delivers the information with compassion and is engaging and entertaining.Mostly following Katherine's story, we are taken on her journey feeling along with her the lows (I have to mention a particular moment when Dorothy's boss Mrs Mitchell is telling her that 'they should be grateful they have jobs at all' when a gentleman behind me in the cinema loudly stated that he would have wanted to 'smack her in the mouth') and highs (genuinely joyful and humorous moments like the broken-down car section) and gaining a respect and admiration for these women who accomplished so much in such difficult circumstances.Although it did not in any way feel like a lecture, I felt educated and both my friend and I wanted to learn more about these amazing women.With an incredible soundtrack by Pharrell Williams, available via Entertainment/Columbia Records, this film is a gem of a movie that deserves all of the accolades, including the SAG Award for Outstanding Performance.",

Having the Voyager satellite exit the solar system may seem like a major accomplishment (which it is), but it's still small compared to the size of the universe. Who can blame us considering how we've come within the world of transportation. Even getting to space took some time to figure out. It's something we've been trying to do for a while, but everything was set on a hurrying motion once the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. The 1960's had us racing against the Soviets for everything; power, technology, and especially the accomplishment of space. It was all about being the first and the US government wanted to make sure that NASA could make that happen. Like I said, the problem was solving a lot of problems that it took to get people to space and making sure they could get back. NASA had hired some of the most intelligent people around, yet they were still having trouble finding the right solutions. The answers seemed to be found within the minds of outsiders as shown in Hidden Figures. In the early 1960's, racial segregation is still an issue. Things seem to be a bi more progressive at NASA as they have employed several African-Americans to do a lot of the computing that complicated things. Here we focus on three individuals; mathematics genius Katherine Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (played by Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (played by Janelle Mon\u00e1e). They seem to be doing well at NASA, even though they still face some discrimination from their white superiors. Once the Soviets get the first people into space, NASA is looking to get an astronaut to orbit the Earth.Katherine is hired up to help compute launch and landing numbers for the Space Task Group, being directed by Al Harrison (played by Kevin Costner) and his assistant Paul Stafford (played by Jim Parsons). Meanwhile, Dorothy sees that her and her fellow computing workers are about to be out of a job now that new IBM computers are being installed. To ensure work, Dorothy takes it upon herself to learn to new computer and see if she can get her coworkers to understand it. Also, Mary is being recommended to become an engineer, but company regulations require a certain course from a college that's white only.Unlike Moonlight, which was a bleak and human look at a struggling African-American, Hidden Figures is more upbeat and hopeful portrayal of changing times. Does that make it better then the latter? No, as Moonlight is something that'll be studied in a lot of college courses in race relations, Hidden Figures is more general with it's approach and will be played in the high schools as a history lesson. That is definitely not a bad thing as this movie is still entertaining, especially considering that the majority of the plot is solving a complex mathematical formula.All three main actors (Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e) are fantastic and carry their own stories well enough that your never disappointed that the movie is cutting away to their segment. I was curious about how all the of them were going to proceed, given the unfortunate rules of the time. I liked the majority of the cast around them (with the exception of Jim Parsons, who only seems to be playing a version of his Bing Bang Theory character). The film can get a little slow towards the hour mark, but it all picks up towards it's finale which I wont give away. I'll give this eight Mercury rockets out of ten. If you have any interest of the space program and it's history, then I cannot recommend this movie enough. Hidden Figures has a lot energy and passion of portraying this real life story. Like Rudy, I think this'll make people want to follow their goals more. So see if this rocket story launches in your favor.",

All three are gifted beyond even their contemporaries at NASA, but all three are held back by the double \"handicaps\" of sex and colour. This film tells their stories.There are several stories here - as well as the individual stories of the three women, there is also the story of fighting to get John Glenn into orbit and safely returned to Earth, and a variety of what would be called sub-plots if this were fiction.But it isn't fiction. Dramatised for the screen, yes, but the substance here is true, and it is sobering to realise that the colour bar in the USA was fully operational so recently.For all that we are presented with a dispiriting picture of how things were, we are never lectured to. This film is rich and heartwarming, helped by the portrayal of these three great women whose achievements and real-life pictures are shown with the end credits. These are strong characters, nicely drawn. We like them, and are pleased to see that their abilities and achievements are finally recognised. The performances here are all good - the principals hold the film, of course. but Kevin Costner as the Head of the Mission Control maths department is another sympathetic character, while Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons are effectively less so.The period detail is good. The film is paced well, subject only to a bit too much time given to Katherine's half-mile runs to the toilet. And there is quite a lot of humour. For a two-hour film, the time never drags.

I think Kevin Costner held a piece of chalk a couple of times, but he spent most of the time telling us how awesome the main character was. Whilst the height of realism is not required, the hard focus on the main character suggested almost that she was doing ALL the work herself, which made the whole thing look weak and unconvincing.(Mini-spoiler: what DID give her the right to insist on attending a classified briefing? Theoretically, other people would have to know data too, but, of course, no one else does anything at all, so her case is different. Seemed like a pretty cushy job to work in that office.) Some other things happened in this movie. They weren't as important as the main characters. (The really motivated and snappy character got left behind about half way through.

Needless to say being an African American female was replete with hardships; every small step forward was on the back of sacrifice and suffering. This uplifting true story is a testimonial to the unwavering efforts of three brave women who, through their genius and determination, forged the first steps towards equality at NASA. Writer-director Theodore Melfi has chosen the crowd-pleasing path, opting for a more light-hearted tone that allows the audience to revel in the brilliance of these women rather than getting bogged down in the difficulties that they faced. The tough topics aren't shied away from entirely though, one particularly heart-wrenching scene places the issue of segregation front and centre when mathematical genius Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) is forced to explain that her bathroom breaks are so lengthy due to the building having no 'coloured toilets'. It's not an overly subtle screenplay, the broad strokes of struggle often boiled down to showcase moments like the aforementioned confrontation, but it's delivered with such passion and pluck that it's utterly affecting. A spot on cast helps with the energy too: Henson shines throughout as a widowed mother of three, Octavia Spencer bustles with resolve as the pragmatic Dorothy, Janelle Mon\u00e1e spices it up as sassy engineer Mary, and Kevin Costner brings his All-American charm to a forward-thinking NASA manager. Insightful, moving and entertaining, Hidden Figures is an inspiring tale of achieving one's dreams despite constant adversity.",

            "content": "\"Every time we get a chance to get ahead they move the finish line. Every time.\" Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) The pre-launch action prior to the late John Glenn's epic orbit in 1962 is uniquely lensed through the points of view of three black women who, as math-based NASA computers, were instrumental in the success of the project. Hidden Figures goes beyond the romance of the history to touch on multiple cultural challenges with soft, fuzziness and smarts.On one level, this biopic hammers home the stupidity of segregation especially when it requires math genius Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) to spend 40 minutes to go to the \"colored\" toilet. Well, launch honcho Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) takes care of that problem by tearing down the sign and with it the prejudice under attack in the Civil Rights Movement.Costner embodies the rational but humane spirit of NASA, which, like him, needs to get the job done regardless of social inequities, as leaders like him reach beyond computation to bigger issues like beating the Russians in the space race. His cool but caring and global instincts mirror President Kennedy's drive to succeed regardless of the civil rights turmoil.On a second level, Hidden Figures tackles the second-class citizenship of women, who despite capabilities as powerful as those of men, are excluded from meetings that would put them in charge of the rapidly-changing computations especially about the tricky re-entry going from parabolic to elliptical or the other way in a dance with death. I'm being unfairly flip because the heart of this drama is not math but the right of all humans to be equal.The premise of the film with brilliant ladies marginalized until they direct their individual fates is an apt metaphor for oppressed and undervalued people.On a third level, this entertaining drama deals with the colossal emergence of computers, in this case giant mainframe IBMS, which threaten not only our Russian competitors but also the jobs of our brilliant ladies. Have no fear, for Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) comes to the rescue as supervisor par excellence.Hidden Figures could be criticized for its lenient treatment of wrongdoers and its benign depiction of the heroines, but I prefer to think like Costner's character that we should go beyond the \"figures\" to the bigger gestalt of universal equality. In this warm history, even the Russians come off well enough as experts who beat us into orbit (Yuri Gagarin).Yet, we beat them to the moon! That striving without cultural barriers is the anchor of this romantic adventure, just as riveting as any superhero blockbuster, a genre that has gone way beyond prejudice long ago and far, far away.",

You'll feel better and uplifted after watching it, and possibly ashamed of certain aspects of America's past.Because it's also a story of prejudice and segregation and the inhumanity - and, let's face it, downright stupid ignorance - of man to fellow man, and woman and African-American women in particular. And, yes, even though it takes place in the 1960s, it's about the inherent arrogance and stupidity of men so nothing changes there! Makes you wonder how much better so many areas of life and business would be if women had more input or control.The three stars - Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e - are superb and Kevin Costner is excellent although his role is hardly demanding. Kirsten Dunst, one of my fave actresses, seems almost to be playing a bit-part, slightly under-acting, but convincing as someone who, perhaps, changes their mind.The best lines go to Spencer and Dunst:Dust: \"Despite what you may think, I have nothing against y'all.\"Spencer: \"I know. I know you probably believe that.\"Badoom!!!Yes, the director also had a hand in the screenplay but not solely and it was based on a book so if there were any indulgent excesses they were generally reigned in.Throw in some info about the space race and this is an all-round excellent movie, well worth watching for many reasons, and family-friendly, too!",

Within the framework of reverse racism, the real genius, white man Jack Crenshaw, is barely acknowledged.Hidden Figures matters and must be lavished with awards and praise to hide that it is propaganda based on a fabric of lies.

It is truly a beautiful story that showcases three brilliant and courageous colored women who made their voices heard and improved things for themselves. Katherine, Mary and Dorothy each made progress and subsequently their mark. Dorothy became proficient in the use of IBM machines, Mary got a court order and fought racist rules and traditions to become the first African American engineer. Katherine also fought racist attitudes and got a seat to classified meetings and provided perfect numbers for NASA. The film highlights how NASA was held back from achieving its goals because of racism and not using all its human intelligence. Racism only hinders human progress and the best ideas rising to the top. Three brilliant women overthrew these racist traditions in an organization that is supposed to value intelligence and innovation. How far the human race would have gone if we valued Merit over superficial qualities. A powerful message is delivered that intelligence can be found among us all regardless of color. It is not concentrated but distributed naturally. The only issue with this film was the soundtrack. It did not fit well at all with the time period and did not suit the mood. What's funny is the 60s had some of the greatest music. Understandably many films now use these songs in their films but the soundtrack could have included not so popular tracks of that time. Modern music and mashups undermine the quality and mood of it. We see some stellar performances from the main three cast members who portray Dorothy, Mary and Katherine. This film was appropriately named to illustrate the great contributions made by women who are not given all the credit they deserve due to the time period and so are hidden in history amid other names. Besides being brilliant woman they were also mothers who supported their families, true backbones of American life and society. Their bravery and courage to challenge ignorant racist customs and bring progress perhaps make them the Rosa Parks of NASA. Definitely recommended, 8/10",

Taraji P. Henson is without a doubt the highlight as Katherine G. Johnson, she is absolutely mesmeric in this part and had me engaged every single moment she was on screen, delivering a real, truly extraordinary performance. I did find that the film did not try hard enough to bring the struggles of these three women to the forefront. While I would usually like this kind of light hearted humour that features here, it felt like an injustice for such an incredible true story, it failed to uplift me as a result. As well as that, I was never convinced by Octavia Spencer, it felt as if she was just acting and was not truly immersing herself in to this part. She was going through the motions which made the ensemble of the three females fall flat. Flawed, but enjoyable. Certainly not perfect, Hidden Figures still brings an incredible, unknown true story to the forefront, which certainly makes it worth a watch if you are looking for a good biography film.\nFollows three female, African-American mathematicians who served a major role during the early years of NASA.\nBest Performance: Taraji P.

Hollywood is obsessed with the oppressed black narrative and it really shows in this film. It also seems that Kevin Costner plans on finishing his career preaching the same narrative to all of white America, as if white America doesn't already understand the history.I did appreciate the way the film portrayed black female kindness and strength. I have been very close to some black females and have great respect for their kindness and decency.The history lesson of the American space program and the important role that black females played in it is interesting.

            "content": "\"Hidden Figures\" (2016 release; 127 min.) brings the story, \"based on true events\" we are reminded at the beginning, of three African- American women working at NASA. As the movie opens, we are in \"West Virginia, 1926\", where we see a young girl amaze everyone with her math skills, and she is soon offered a scholarship to attend classes for the gifted. We then move to \"Hampton, Virginia, 1961\", where we get to know the three ladies. They are having car trouble, and when a police officer drives by and checks what the problem is, he can hardly believe they all work at NASA (but does give them an escort). At NASA, the ladies are working at the \"Colored Computers\" section, but then one day, Katherine is asked to join the \"Space Task Group\", as the space race with the USSR is in full swing. At this point we're 15 min. or so into the movie but to tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second movie from writer-director Theodore Melfi (after the Bill Murray vehicle \"St Vincent\" a few years ago). Here he brings the larger than life (yet true) story of how these three ladies ended up playing an important, if not critical role, in the space race, in particular getting John Glenn into orbit, yet at the same time suffering from the racial segregation that was into place still in those days. The 'running joke' in the movie is that Katherine disappears time and again to run to the \"Colored Ladies Room\" which is 1/2 mile away from the Space Task Group. When one day confronted about her long absences by the agency's head, she boils over in emotion and anger and humiliation when she explains why (truly a chilling moment in the movie). Not long thereafter, the agency's head does away with the segregated bathrooms, claiming \"Here at NASA, we're all the same color!\" (the theater's audience erupted with a huge applause at that time, amazing). The movie truly is a mix of \"The Right Stuff\" and the horrible racial segregation and discrimination that was the accepted norm then. (Interestingly, \"Hidden Figures\" is set in officially segregated Virginia, just like that other recent and equally important movie \"Loving\" about an interracial couple's fight to get their marriage recognized in the late 50s/early 60s.) \"Hidden Figures\" is helped enormously by the heartwarming performances of the three lead actresses: Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae (recently also in the equally excellent \"Moonlight\"), but most of all Taraji Henson as Katherine. Kevin Costner as the agency's head is okay too. Kirstin Dunst is barely recognizable as Vivian, another NASA employee. There are tons of great songs in the movie, both oldies from that era but also new tunes (sounding like oldies) penned by Pharell Williams (the score is courtesy of veteran Hans Zimmer). My only 'complaint', minor as it is, is that the movie's running time is a bit too long for its own good, and could've easily be edited/trimmed by 15-20 min.\"Hidden Figures\" expanded wide this past weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED to the rafters, literally sold out to the very last seat. The audience laughed and cried, and when the end credits started rolling, gave it a thunderous applause. It blows the mind that the story of these \"Hidden Figures\" has never been brought to the big screen until now, but better late than never I suppose. In any event, \"Hidden Figures\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

The main story concerns the small victories that the three leads have working at NASA as black females but its told within the context of the race to get a man in space, which is gripping and genuinely entertaining in its own right. There's humor, a little bit of romance, and feel- good moments that should speak to any person who's ever been overlooked or under-appreciated, especially within a massive organization.I have no idea how much of this is true and what has been padded for dramatic purposes. But, I don't agree with the naysayers who accuse this movie of re-writing history. Of the three leads, one's victory is getting a judge to let her attend a segregated school so she can get the classes she needs to be an engineer; another remains in the clerical pool for the most part but sees the value in learning FORTRAN to avoid redundancy and is finally promoted to supervisor and earns the right to be respected (shown by being addressed as Mrs. Vaughn and not by her first name); the main lead performs calculations that are critical to one aspect of a space flight.

            "content": "Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson are not household names. In fact, they were not even on the radar until Theodore Melfi's film Hidden Figures told their story. Based on the book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly, Hidden Figures is about three African-American women working at NASA in the 1960s who broke through barriers of race and gender to become essential contributors to the U.S. space program and without which, famous astronauts such as John Glenn and Allan Shepard would probably have never flown. All three were employed by NASA but only as \"computers,\" people who worked for the engineering and flight sections performing manual calculations.As the space program pushed through boundaries to match the Russian man in space program, barriers had to be broken on the ground as well to complete a successful mission. Though it was 1961 and the civil rights movement had already begun under the leadership of Martin Luther King, restaurant lunch counters, water fountains in public parks, libraries, and bathrooms were still segregated. In the film which was nominated for Best Picture at the 2017 Oscars, the three women, Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) have to deal with humiliating incidents of racial prejudice they repeatedly encounter on the job though they were as brainy and qualified as their male counterparts.What they lacked was the title of engineer and mathematician and the respect of equal pay for equal work. Dorothy is denied the title of supervisor by her boss Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) even though she is already doing supervisor's work. Mary wants to become an engineer and work in the engineering section, but she requires college courses which can only be taken at a school that denies entry to people of color. Katherine, a mathematics genius, works on a Special Task Force for Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), but her main job is to check the calculations of her white male co-workers, including that of the coldly disdainful Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons). They all feel the pressure to do their jobs without complaining unless they are labeled as troublemakers.This means the indignity of Katherine putting up with having to walk a half mile to go to the nearest \"colored\" rest room, Mary having to go to court just to be able to take night classes at the local high school, and Dorothy having to plead her case to her boss to be given the title of Supervisor. Hidden Figures is more than an entertaining feel-good movie, though it is that. It is a long overdue recognition of what life was like for African-Americans under segregation and the special burden that women had to face. While the film is a hard-edged depiction of racial prejudice, it is not preachy or one-dimensional but treats its protagonists as human beings who deserve our respect and admiration.Melfi cares for his characters, showing Katherine's courtship by Colonel Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali) and the women's family and church life with warmth and humor. Granted the film is not notable for its depth of characterization or its subtlety and Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson were not saints, yet the truth is that saints are not necessarily those who perform miracles, but are also those who stand up for human dignity. In that respect, the three women deserve the title.",

The reason it usually comes out at this time of year is that the Academy Awards eat it up and it receives multiple nominations. The same thing happens with the holocaust as a subject almost every year without fail. I have no problem with this. If that's what people like in their films then c'est la vie. The problem only occurs when the film starts entirely falling back on the race factor. When the entire purpose becomes showing how evil the white man is, and how special black people are simply because they are black. I read a quote from the real-life Katherine Johnson saying she couldn't understand why anyone would want to make a film about her life. In a way she makes a very valid point. Making a film about this lady is in its own way a little bit racist. It's saying this story is film-worthy simply because she was black. This will probably pass over most audience member's heads, but anyone who stops and thinks about it will realise this is actually quite insulting.As far as being watchable goes the film is actually very good. The two hour run time flies by and there are some very well laid out scenes that impressively get across the message the film is trying to sell. There is also some very fine acting, particularly from Taraji P. Henson. In one scene in particular, around the midway point, she completely blew away. I think this film would have worked as a story on its own, even putting aside the race factor. The fact that its in there does add another level to the film, but I'm not entirely sure it was necessary.

'Hidden Figures' presents the stories of three 'coloured' women (to employ a contemporaneous term used throughout the film) who worked for NASA at the dawn of the 'space-age'. Each of the three represented significant firsts for African American women in the space program: Mary Jackson became as an NASA engineer, Katherine Goble/Johnson as a high-level mathematician co-authoring research reports and Dorothy Vaughan as a supervisor (and later computer programmer). The women achieved these milestones through persistence, competence and drive and their stories deserve to be told and celebrated. Unfortunately, the movie chooses to make up facts and alter the time-line, presumably to make the story more dramatic. The whole '1/2 mile trip to the coloured toilet' is fiction, NASA had desegregated before the story takes place, and after the second or third trip, the scenes began to strike me as demeaning. The segment where Dorothy Vaughan, having read an introduction to Fortran, walks into the room containing the non-functioning IBM mainframe and immediately spots the problem (not plugged in?) is ridiculous. No one expects movies to be history lectures and telling complex stories in a couple of hours requires a lot of streamlining and consolidation (e.g. Kevin Costner's character is a composite of a number of senior NASA team-members), but making up significant events simply because they look good on screen undercuts the credibility of the story and is unpardonable in a movie that wants to be taken seriously (Harrison didn't exist, and if a metaphorical crowbar was taken to the \"colored\" bathroom sign, it was welded by Goble/Johnson). All of this is unfortunate, as the movie is (IMO) generally entertaining and presents a story worth telling. I was quite enjoying it until the IBM scene, which seemed so unlikely that I googled up the 'accuracy' of the film, and hit endless critical 'fact checking' sites (many neutral but some with an agenda). Like the dire \"Red Tails\" (2012), the filmmakers should have had more faith in their material (and their audience).",

I've seen The Right Stuff, Apollo 13, and I know a little bit about the background of NASA. But I knew nothing of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. Going into a film with little previous knowledge can be immensely rewarding experience. And although Hidden Figures isn't the best movie, it's most certainly a film worth seeing.Playing the three \"hidden figures\" are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae respectively. Aside from quite a few supporting performances from Spencer, I'm not overly familiar with these actresses' work. And perhaps unexpectedly, all three of them are terrific. Spencer gets the least to do out of the three, and still has a memorable banter with Kirsten Dunst, a racist co-worker. Monae brings a fresh and lighthearted character into the fold and complements the two of them well. Taraji P. Henson on the other-hand, is on a completely different level. If it wasn't for Portman, Adams, and Stone giving such acclaimed turns this year, Henson would have likely been a front-runner. Considering she's playing someone without much wiggle room to show emotion, it's impressive that I felt as though I could understand exactly what she was feeling in every scene. She only gets a few scenes to express herself in a grand way emotionally, and she makes the best out of them. It was easily one of the best performances of the year.Even though this story is very interesting on paper (three African American females working for NASA significantly helping America's chances of winning the Space Race), I feel like the film could have taken advantage of the story even more. I love the relationships these women have together and I instantly bought into their chemistry, as I did the material with each of the women's personal lives and families. But I don't think it came all together as neatly as I would have hoped. I wish we would have gotten a little more time with the three women together, instead of hammering home the underlying message involving racism. There's no question this story needed to be told, but at times the execution felt more formulaic than natural.+Henson is extraordinary+Incredible story+Emotion hits a few times-Directing and editing felt a little choppy-Needed more time spent with just the three of them7.0/10",

It's movies like these that absolutely must be told, as there are loads who haven't been widely known yet. This film reminded me of one of my all time favorite films, The Imitation Game, another biopic about a math genius underdog who's extraordinary skills helped change the world for the better. I personally detest maths, but the heart of the story lies in the real life women who overcame both racial and gender barriers and use their skills to advance the achievements of NASA.The soundtrack is absolutely marvelous and should be nominated for many awards. The person who made the biggest impression on me was Taraji P. Henson as Katherine Johnson, the no- nonsense mathematician who worked closely with Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) head of NASA.This is an incredibly inspiring and uplifting film. Definitely not one to miss!",

I am a big space program buff, and delight in little-known stories being told.There may be some spoilers in what I write below, so proceed with caution!I did enjoy the movie while watching it, but was constantly taken out of the moment by the never ending stream of silly, sloppy mistakes. I have no problem with creative license and dramatizing stories for better results. But there were a LOT of real honkers throughout. I got the impression the everyone was so focused on the story that all the details went by without review or supervision.I don't plan to write a comprehensive list of all that was wrong. But I will illustrate just a few things:The inside of a Mercury capsule was barely larger than the astronaut. Yet the scenes inside the capsule looked like something on the accuracy level of \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\". Just throw a knob and a duct on a piece of gray plywood behind the astronaut and call it a day. And when entering the Mercury capsule, the threshold looks for all the world like it is made from a white painted window frame bought at Home Depot.From day to day in the NASA parking lot, it looks like nothing changes...maybe all those engineers never moved their cars.Sound effects and foley sounds throughout are often inappropriate or inaccurate, and for no good reason. I just don't think the film makers were trying in this regard. One example, the IBM computer room printer sounds like a completely different kind of printer...this is as jarring as seeing the jet in \"Airplane\" with the sound of a propeller plane in the soundtrack, but unlike that movie it is not funny.When John Glenn's capsule is discovered to have possible heat shield issues, that concern (which did not last long) has time to be carried to the press,distributed to the public, and there is time for all of them to get all worked up over it and fret in front of TV sets. And when the engineers are fretting over the possibly loose heat shield, the female 'computer' (the focus of the story) chimes in authoritatively with some wisdom that she almost certainly could not have known....yes she was a brilliant mathematician and knew lots of things, but was she also suddenly a materials scientist, a spacecraft engineer with expertise in heat shields and re-entry physics, who would be the only one in the room full of experts who seemed to know anything about the matter at hand?Apparently nobody on the film crew knows that the heat shield is on the bottom of the capsule, not the side.Does this kind of thing ruin the movie? No, it does not. But if more attention had been paid these details this would have been a greater movie and not just a decent, feel-good, 'made for TV style' movie.",

            "content": "I wouldn't have thought this movie was released as late as January 6th, 2017, it seems like it came out longer ago than that. The reason it strikes me is because John Glenn passed away on December 8th, 2016, just about a month shy of the picture's opening. It would be a shame if he never got to see it, even in a rough draft form. Glenn's character comes across as an enlightened individual in an era still marred by racial segregation. The actor portraying Glenn, by the name of Glen Powell, did have a passing resemblance to the former astronaut and United States senator.For someone who grew up in the era, the story takes you back to the beginning of the country's space program and the inherent rivalry between the U.S and Russia. Seeing it portrayed on screen made it seem more like a literal life or death situation, at least in terms of prestige, than what I seem to remember of those days. Although it did bother me personally that Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space and not one of our guys. But then we outdistanced those pesky Russkies with multiple Earth orbits and of course the grand prize, first man on the moon in the years to follow. So that dose of reality helped spark the initiative to go the extra mile.What's probably an eye opener in the story for those of a more modern upbringing, is the character of Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), head of the NASA team to put the first man in space. Does anyone think Harrison was worried about offending anyone when he made his staff stay late to reach the team's goals? Whether it ever actually happened or not, I had to cheer that scene when he took a crowbar to the 'Colored Bathroom' sign. It seemed like he was the only character willing to question the rules when it came to black/white relations within the department, not only in regards to work space, but to attendance at meetings and giving proper credit to those who performed the work.Regarding the principal players, I thought Taraji Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae all did a superb job portraying their characters. All were shown dealing with aspects of both their personal and professional lives, carrying themselves with dignity, even in trying situations. What one remembers of the civil rights struggle of the Sixties is often tempered by demonstrations and violence, but the women in the story exemplified how strength of character, patience and talent would eventually mean much more in terms of winning a nation's respect. It's a good lesson for all of us a half century later, for even if conditions have vastly improved for race relations, the element that exploits the race industry does the country a great disservice with misinformation and outright deception.",

Did the Costner character really not see the kettle marked \"coloured\"? Was it really a trek to the bathroom? But this can only be a minor criticism and surely represent the prevailing attitudes of the days in parts of the USA - and lets be honest still in existence in many other parts of the world today.

            "content": "Very few films were made until now about the beginnings of the American space program, and I am wondering why. Here is a true American saga that took place at a time that is still remembered by many of us. It's a story with famous and anonymous heroes, a story that begins with the dismay and fear caused by the Soviets taking early lead in the race to space (with the launching of the Sputnik and with sending the first man in space) and ends in triumph with the Apollo program and the moon landings. And yet, Hollywood still has to approach the period and make the movies about this great story and the men that made it possible. Hidden Figures only partly fills some of this gap, looking at a little known aspect of the first space programs, from a specific perspective, with the emphasis on an unexpected and unknown aspect - the racial prejudice that faced and had to be overcome by the first Afro-American contributors to the program. It tells the story of (until now) little known heroes who not only were 'colored' but also all happened to be women.Hidden Figures is a fiction film based on the nonfiction book Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, written by historian Margot Lee Shetterly. The script authors and director Theodore Melfi where extremely careful in the details, from dialogues that aim to be as close to reality as they are remembered by the heroes who lived the period (including apparently a scene that looks very Hollywood-like but apparently did happen, with John Glenn on the launching ramp of the very first flight asking for the computations to be checked by 'the girl' he met in the preparation meetings room) to details about how buildings, corridors, rooms, parking lots looked at the NASA compounds in Virginia. What is shocking today especially from a non-American perspective is the extent to which segregation and racial discrimination was part of life and of the books of laws a little more than half a century ago, in the country that was leading the democracy block in its fight against Communism, and was working to send its first men to space.Yet, the 'inspirational' tone dominates the film, and the viewer has the feeling that almost every fact, action, or spoken dialog is in line with the point that the film aims to make. A more realistic or neutral approach would have made the message more convincing IMO. I did like the characters development, the fact that three women who are the lead characters in the film have each her own personality, talents, way of overcoming prejudice. The three actresses are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e and I hope to see them in more (good) movies ahead. Kevin Costner and Kirsten Dunst are cast in supporting roles and they do a good job. Hidden Figures is a solid and in some places emotional film, but cannot break the convention of genre and style that it seems that the authors imposed on themselves.",

Hidden Figures is an amazing, uplifting, inspiring story focusing on the successes of three African-American women whose mathematical and computer-science skills directly helped NASA launch astronauts into space (and back) and eventually to the moon.The bulk of the events depicted are from 1961 at the Langley Research Center and Project Mercury. If you had asked me \"When did NASA desegregate?\" I would have been stumped, because I never knew NASA was segregated. The movie gives a palpable sense of the raw frustration and pain caused by senseless discrimination, and it does so so simply by facing us with the harsh reality and indignity of having to walk over a mile each day just to use the bathroom. The women entrusted to make critical astronomical calculations couldn't even be trusted to share the same space for a minute or two in what is one of the most common, natural, and inherent aspects of humanity.And it's a double-whammy: they're black, and they're women. Hidden Figures is just as much, if not more so, about sexism and exposing the baseless belief that women either should not or cannot excel at science. There's a great satisfaction when the Director of the Space Task Group literally sledge-hammers the bathroom signs down, ending a practice that never should have started.Do yourself a favor and catch Hidden Figures on the big screen, see it with a big crowd, and feel a sense of humanity trickling back in.",

            "content": "Wow, it seems like forever since I've viewed a PG-rated film that wasn't cloaked in animation.That film in question, is Hidden Figures (my latest review). As a true events story based on female African-Americans working at NASA, it's something that any one of any age, could like. You could definitely take the family to it. You could see it on IMAX. And oh yeah, you could show \"Hidden\" in classrooms if you were a history teacher.A late 2016 release geared up for Oscar, Hidden Figures is a movie that shows some Disney flair but is actually distributed by 20th Century Fox. There were times when I was reminded of The Right Stuff (scenes of John Glen's Friendship 7 spaceflight are presented) and yes, there were times when I felt like I was watching a women's version of Remember the Titans. The outcome of \"Hidden\" may be a little predictable, a little too happy happy, and a little too obvious in the ways things work themselves out. There's also a romantic subplot featured that kind of feels underdeveloped. Oh well. That doesn't mean you can't embrace \"Hidden's\" infectious, feel good nature. Director Theodore Melfi (2014's St. Vincent) gives Hidden Figures a pristine look, capturing the early 1960's segregation and dwindling, racial discrimination in lower Virginia. He also captures effectively, a few space travel sequences via the well known Air Force Station in Cape Canaveral, FL. There is conflict in this film but it doesn't overwhelm you. The stakes are just high enough with the olden style tunes of Pharrell Williams happily playing in the background. As for the performances, well they are admirable and the characters the actors inhabit, are variably likable. Taraji P. Henson is all aces playing brilliant mathematician Katherine Johnson. She gets tapped to calculate the numbers needed to send a U.S. man into space. Octavia Spencer plays real-life Dorothy Vaughan, a supervisor at Langley Research Center. Janelle Monae channels Mary Jackson, a successful engineer who also works at Langley. Finally, Kevin Costner takes on the role of Al Harrison, the fictional director of NASA's Space Task Group. Based on the amount of ticket receipts that Hidden Figures has already brought in ($84 million), it's good to see Costner finally getting his box office sea legs back. \"Hidden\" is heads and tails above his other fare like Black or White and Criminal. In conclusion, I read a fellow critic's review on another website I write for. He deciphered what the title of Hidden Figures means. My similar take is this: Hidden Figures translates into the math equations done by Katherine Johnson that no one knows about. All anyone saw on TV in 1962, was how John Glen successful orbited the Earth three times. My other take is as follows: \"Hidden\" has to do the oppressed females themselves. They were hidden mind you. They were (and some still are) educated, brilliant, and astute. Because of the color of their skin, it was tough for them to forge ahead in the narrow-minded South. Now do I think Hidden Figures is Academy Award worthy? Somewhat. There are hints that the proceedings feel all too perfect, saccharine-like, and pat. Do I think \"Hidden\" is entertaining, breezy, and worthy of feeling? Yes of course. Heck, we'll all know the outcome on Feb. 26. My rating: 3 stars.",

            "content": "There is a subplot in the film where Katherine disappears for 40 minutes every day from her desk at NASA to use a bathroom in a different building, because in segregation-America, there are no facilities for her in her building. When this comes to light, her Boss finds that Katherine has also been forced to use a different coffee jug from her white colleagues. There is then a moment where he removes the label from Katherine's jug used to indicate her race and glares round at her ashamed coworkers. I thought 'at last - some subtlety and intelligence of dramatic touch. Everyone knows what he means removing the label and glaring at them - no more segregation in the building.' Unfortunately, the next scene, this same Boss smashes the segregationist sign off the women's toilets with a double-handed lump hammer. I feel this is an apt metaphor for how the film treats its message.This is a common problem for films which have a message, whether its about racism or sexism embedded in every day interactions, or the blight of poverty or whatever - they often underestimate the awareness, compassion and intelligence of the audience. I'm reminded here in the UK of films such as Made In Dagenham or Suffragette.Obviously, unless you suffered racial prejudice in a segregated country, you can never know what that was like. But then - how do you bring in as wide an audience as possible? A much better approach to this story would have been to focus on the theme. The theme here, surely, is overcoming daunting odds. Everyone, to differing degrees, can relate to it. So it's strange that I cannot remember any of the characters going through any truly dark moments of self-doubt, or doubt that a more equal society will come forth. For the most part of the film, it seems, a sassy remark and a cheeky smile is enough to turn round the main characters' fortunes in each and every scene - yet it must have been far harder for the real women this story is based on.Levity vs Poignancy. It's a difficult balance for the writers, who do at least a good job of injecting humour throughout. Yet much of this humour seems artificial and Mr Melfi would have done better if he had trusted both the story and the audience much more.Full marks, however, for discovering this piece of history. I am always intrigued by finds such as this. For example, I would love to see a biopic of Noor Inayat Khan. I hope when they do this, though, they really take more time over the script than is evident in Hidden Figures.",

            "content": "The going was never easy for Afro-American mathematicians Katherine, Dorothy and Mary at NASA. Their inspirational story has been (partially) recreated by Theodore Melfi and makes for an engaging watch. Though some facts could have been tinkered with, much of the misogyny and discrimination faced by these women at various circumstances during their stint and NASA (and elsewhere) are picturized in a believable manner.The friendly banter between the three women (especially the scenes in the car) is a scream. Spencer, Henson and Monae are wonderfully radiant and light up most of their respective scenes. Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst and Mahershala Ali and the rest pitch in with above-par supporting performances.It must have surely been intimidating for an Afro-American woman to work/study in institutions filled with scathing white men who tend to look down upon the colored. Katherine having to run half a mile to get to a 'colored' ladies restroom relieve herself, use a coffee machine designated for the 'colored', being denied entry at male-dominated meetings are just few instances where the viewer starts rooting for her character by default. That she is a wonderful mother only adds to her already-likable character arc. Sames goes with the other two women. Dorothy eventually goes on to head the programming department while Mary graduates in engineering, only by way of upgrading themselves through substantial efforts. The scene towards the end where Dorothy's white colleague played by Dunst finally addresses her as 'Mrs. Vaughan' declaring her newly-discovered admiration, is one of the stand- out moments in a film that boasts of several.The climax, although one that looks slightly tweaked to champion the presence of the three leads, is a well-cooked 'feel-good' meal. 'Hidden Figures' rightfully deserves a viewing for its affable performances and zealous writing/direction.Verdict: Inspiring feel-good flick!",

When is Hollywood going to make movies that include everyone in this society without 'discrimination' being the focal point? When will they make movies without singling out white people as racists? There's nothing groundbreaking here. It's the typical story of white people oppressing blacks and how the characters rise above it all; another clich\u00e9 and stereotype perpetuated year after year after year. Now they're portraying nasa as a racist organization. I didn't work at langley or live in virginia at that time but I seriously doubt much of the story is accurate. My first job out of college was working for the fed in the late 70s and there was no such nonsense. I met a lot of knuckleheads when I did a stint at an aerospace company but during the rest of my career in IT there was never any discrimination against women or minorities. It's not that I didn't see it; it didn't exist. I find it hard to believe that engineers, mathematicians and scientists at nasa would behave that way. My first job with the fed, I was introduced to two computer programmers (one black, one white) that worked on Univac I which was the first commercial computer. I was at the beginning of my career and they were at the end so I looked at them as dinosaurs and obsolete. Later I began to appreciate their careers. When they started back in the 50s, there were probably less than 1000 computer programmers in the whole world and now there are millions and I'm only counting the hard coders, not script kiddies or web coders. But, you couldn't make a movie about either one because frankly their working lives were boring. Nope, no drama in the workplace. And anyway, in IT and technology in general, no one usually cares about who's first or what happened, just what happens next. But 'colored' coffee pots is just made up Hollywood nonsense and perpetuates the stereotypes and divisions in the US. The movie is not a documentary but it's not about nasa either. It's just a story about racial prejudice and overcoming discrimination. However, I can't get over all the technical errors and mumbo jumbo the writers came up with. Usually producers hire technical consultants but in more recent years it seems Hollywood doesn't care what people might take away from a movie. They don't care if actors are saying dumb lines because they figure the audience is too stupid to notice. I find it insulting to pay $12 for a movie and then have to sit thru gibberish. Plus the story was written for five year olds. I'll bet my life savings that nasa didn't hold up the launch so they could check calculations. That's just silly. Unfortunately there are a lot of people who believe what they see in the movies so I have to mention two things. 1) you can't bypass a starter motor and never, never try to start a car the way it was shown in the movie. It's very dangerous. 2) computers in that day did not solve math equations or derive new math. They just did your basic arithmetic. The work the character was doing in the movie could never be replaced by a computer of that day. Computers today, I'm not sure.",

But it is ultimately a fine story that very ably highlights the stresses and frustrations of regular working life with the added humiliation of segregation in the workplace.Indeed, some of the people in the film were composite characters from the book and there were some incidents in the film that didn't actually happen. One of the most over-the-top \"Hollywood\" scenes is one where Kevin Costner (as Katherine's boss) is wielding a pick axe (those who've seen the movie will know what I mean). Despite these liberties with the truth, the scenes of segregation still had the right effect of outraging the viewer. The highlight is a scene in which Katherine, who had been timid up to a point, has a perfect meltdown scene (Hanson's best moment in a fine performance). Part of this build-up included the stress of having a very annoying senior peer (played by Jim Parsons) who knows he is less smart than she is and tries to dominate her as much as he can. (Incidentally, \"Loving\", another movie released in late 2016 also highlighted racist laws in Virginia during the same time period.)The directing by Theodore Melfi is rather conventional in a Hollywood way yet the effect worked by the end as I wanted to stand up and cheer during the closing credits. After the film, I pondered the question: how many other hidden histories are waiting to be told?",

I believe that the woman knows how the machine work, but you want me to believe that NASA hires unqualified men to do tasks? Sexism and racism were real (still are), but in male incompetence in NASA, I highly doubt. Another instance is there the machine makes the mistake in calculations and the woman gets it right. It's very possible that a woman would count it right, but I refuse to believe that a machine made a mistake in calculations.Anyway, this film has some half-baked character development and some inspiration for women and black people to fight for their rights, but this film pretty much feels as if they tried to make women superior over men and machines apparently whether intentional or not.",

It's a piece of American history that has been all but completely missing from our collective conscience. Their incredible story deserves to be told as an inspirational message of intuitiveness and perseverance, one that will touch women, minorities & anyone else with a soul. If only the filmmakers were as courageous and smart as these trailblazing women. Hidden Figures gets by solely on its being based in reality; otherwise, it's predictable biopic filmmaking with no faith in its story or audience to connect without pandering. It's far from a complete disaster. It presents some interesting parallels between science and racial inequality, specifically how progress in each can look one way in the numbers & facts but then a completely different way in action. The performances are good, with Monae and Ali specifically standing out, continuing their breakout years after their gentle turns in (the much superior) Moonlight. Individual scenes work in a vacuum, specifically a particularly sweet engagement dinner. Unfortunately, it's all covered in unbearably corny, Blindside-like dialogue and on-the-nose emotional beats. Above all, the music is incessant and awful. A manipulative hodge-podge of modern pop, classic soul, and generically emotional scoring, it's begging us to find the film charming. At times it is, like a late 20th-century Oscar nominee. Mostly though, its pandering emotions and generic filmmaking can't allow it to soar to the heights it should. Hidden Figures isn't a \"bad\" film; it's just a blas\u00e9 film about a decidedly un-blas\u00e9 story.",

            "content": "\"Hidden Figures\" (the ugly N-word that rhymes with it can really only be a coincidence, right?) is an American movie in the English language from 2016. It was written and directed by Theodore Melfi and the original book this is based on is by Margot Lee Shetterly. With an SAG ensemble win and a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars, besides a great deal of other recognition, this is certainly one of the biggest players this awards season. The cast includes several established actors and actresses, even Oscar winners, but also people who are pretty much new to acting like musician Janella Mon\u00e1e playing one of the central characters. This film is set during the days of space exploration. Who'd be first in space? Who'd be first on the moon? All these are central issues here. But it is also about racial inequality back in the 1960s and we find out a bit about how Black people were discriminated against at that point. But to say \"a bit\" is definitely a major understatement here as half of the film is really about this subject and the way she has to run to the toilet across the whole campus (as shocking as it may be) stops being funny quickly and just becomes repetitive. There are more sequences like these. Actually, the characters of Mon\u00e1e and Spencer pretty much only existed to depict this lack of equality.In my opinion, it would have been perfectly fine if they had included some moments that put an emphasis on the entire subject, but the way it is clearly overdone eventually hurts the film. Still, on a more positive note, it is still entertaining, even if it is not informative or touching or anything else. This film is longer than two hours and for this runtime, it drags surprisingly little, maybe not at all even. Henson is certainly the MVP in here, even if I liked Costner as well and the role fit him perfectly. As for Henson, a lot of how memorable she was probably has to do with her costumes and how the character was written, but she also gives a pretty good performance and I would not have minded her getting an Oscar nomination. Spencer got one though and it is at least as undeserving as her win for \"The Help\". Yes she is really fitting for portraying likable headstrong characters, who are certainly different compared to the average Black woman back then, but I am yet to see a performance from her where she at least slightly impresses me at times. Same can be said about Jim Parsons. One of the biggest stars on television for a long time, his transition to the big screen is looking more than just bumpy. Admittedly, he also had very little to work with here.As for the ending, I did not really like it that much when they make it such a drama if the astronaut would live or not as everybody knew he would because otherwise the whole film would have made hardly any sense at all if Henson's character had failed with her calculations. Also the part with the young White girls looking at and listening to Spencer's character is a bit cringeworthy. I still believe that a good film on the subject of race and discrimination manages to depict Black people (or any other minority) as a group that is as gifted, as smart and as talented as Whites, but not that they are better all the time and certainly not from start to finish. Anyway, I am not too surprised awards bodies liked this one as much. With the success here and the one of \"Moonlight\" and \"Fences\" at least nobody can complain about lack of diversity because the likes of Hispanics, Asian Americans and other minorities are not that vocal (gently-speaking) about this subject. Or they understand that they have to deliver something that is among the best of the year to be considered best of the year. As for this film, there is nothing really that I would consider best-of-the-year material, even if some moments and ideas were pretty smart and interesting too watch (like the way technology beats the human mind). I recommend this film, but not very enthusiastically because of all its weaknesses. More of a guilty pleasure film than something that really offers great depth and stunning art.",

The main plot follows Katherine Johnson, a maths wunderkind, who is assigned to the Space Task Group to work on their latest project and, along with Mary Jackson & Dorothy Vaughan, made the impossible possible.Co-written & directed by Theodore Melfi, the story is narrated in an amusing but insightful fashion and keeps a stringent focus on its trio of characters. The plot mostly covers their remarkable work at NASA but every now n then, it would offer a little glimpse into their private lives. The screenplay smooths out the narrative by modifying a few details but it works in the film's favour.The racial & gender issues it presents within the feature are as relevant today as it was at its time, however, the director does well to balance its thought-provoking themes with other elements and makes sure that it remains an enjoyable, accessible & universally appealing ride. Last but not the least, its warm colour palette, well-timed humour & fluid camera-work makes it even more inviting.The three relevant characters exhibit well-defined arcs and are expertly brought to life by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer & Janelle Mon\u00e1e. Kevin Costner & Kirsten Dunst chip in with serviceable inputs while Jim Parsons feels like a miscast. Also, if his presence alone is enough to convince you that he must be playing some intelligent guy, then you have been watching a terrible TV show for far too long.On an overall scale, Hidden Figures is as enjoyable as it is informative, and is a welcome tribute to the genius minds who were responsible for some of our proudest achievements. The undercurrent of Cold War paranoia is evident throughout the story and is overdone at times but the movie retains its uplifting feeling till the very end. Bringing into light the real brains behind human spaceflight's greatest triumph, Hidden Figures is an amusing, entertaining & satisfying delight.",

The movie keeps asking who will be the first on the new side of the world. In that aspect, three women were brave enough to step into the new frontier like NASA.Not only characters but also the ambiance of the movie is vibrant and energetic (not easy considering most of events happen in NASA). Of course all the characters take initiative, never been passive; when moving from one place to another, shots show the whole journey rather than changing the place in a flickering second; various camera angle and the colors.

            "content": "\"Hidden Figures\" is an inspirational bio-pic about three real black women mathematicians who played a part in NASA. It's relentlessly wholesome and a bit starchy, but worth seeing for the history it presents. Taraji P. Henson plays Katherine Johnson, who calculated the flight trajectories for Project Mercury and the Apollo 11 moon flight. Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughan, the first black woman supervisor at NACA (later NASA). Janelle Monae plays Mary Jackson, a mathematician and aerospace engineer. Kevin Costner plays the fictional Al Harrison, a composite boss figure. Kirsten Dunst is another composite figure, representing the mean white racist. Jim Parsons is, again, a composite figure, playing the mean white racist male version. \"Hidden Figures\" shows its leads struggling against white racism. NASA was located in Langley, Virginia, which operated under Jim Crow. Johnson must run between buildings, often in pouring rain, in order to use the \"colored\" restroom. Her coworkers decline to drink coffee from the same pot she uses. White coworkers refer to the black women by their first names, while the black women refer to the whites as Mr or Miss and last name. In spite of all this, the women are able to achieve significant contributions to the space program, using their superior skills at mathematics. The movie's thoroughgoing wholesome preachiness can make it a bit dull. The black people in the film are all perfect \u2013 beautiful, perfectly dressed, kind, rational, great parents. Not a single black character ever dresses poorly or loses her temper or swears or is impatient with children or makes a mistake. Such perfect people make for boring drama. In recent years, Hollywood has caught much flak when it produces movies that show whites advancing black civil rights. \"Mississippi Burning\" was widely criticized for telling the true story of white contributions to the Civil Rights movement. Critics demanded films that depicted blacks as heroes and whites as bad guys. The historical reality is, though, that without white allies, Civil Rights would have been dead in the water. As I was watching \"Hidden Figures,\" I thought of the invisible white allies the film erased from its account. Virtually every white person the film's black women encounter is a hostile bigot or merely clueless (as is Costner's composite character). A Polish engineer, the real life Kazimierz Czarnecki, is shown in a seconds-long scene encouraging a black woman, but it is made clear that he is encouraging her because he is a foreigner and not American. In another seconds-long scene, astronaut John Glenn is shown going out of his way to be pleasant to the black women; Harrison pulls him away, as if to say, \"Being nice to black people is not allowed at NASA.\" I don't believe that African American women were invited into NASA, encouraged to get advanced degrees, and to spread their wings without white higher-ups deciding that NASA would challenge Jim Crow and play a part in the Civil Rights Movement. Those farsighted heroes, whoever they were, have been erased from this account. Another aspect of the film is ironic. The movie wants the viewer to accept black women as thinkers. And yet it dresses two of its leads in the tightest of dresses and the highest of heels and the lushest of fake eyelashes. Even when at home, putting the kids to bed, the leads are picture perfect. Look at photos of the real Jackson, Vaughan, and Johnson. They were not hot models. They looked like mathematicians often look: a bit rumpled, with average attractiveness. Yes yes we all know movies must have attractive leads. But Russel Crowe was allowed to look rumpled and nerdy in \"A Beautiful Mind,\" about mathematician John Nash. No one forced him to wear a tight shirt that displayed his chest hair or his pecs. Even movies urging equality must resort to old fashioned, sexist objectification of women's bodies in order to bring in viewers.",

The black women in this piece have moments where they act exactly like modern Hollywood stereotypes: sassy, ditzy black women who end up showing everyone who's boss. And of course, they have 21st century attitudes about women, sex, etc. I half expected the script to then call for them to be sleeping with all the astronauts, and heck, why not make the girls all bisexual as well?This film pulls the racist card NON-STOP. Every chance it gets, there's a white person putting down a black person, or it's constantly reminding you of \"us versus them\". In an interview with Katherine Johnson, she said she DIDN'T feel like she was personally treated differently when she was at NASA. It was more of a case of segregation, rather than abuse and racist remarks. IMO, this kind of exaggeration in movies only hurts the race issue.The character Harrison portrayed by Kevin Costner was fictional. He was a mix of a few real-life characters, since apparently the film couldn't get the rights to use the real names. Costner did well, but of course they have him smashing down a segregation sign in true Hollywood fashion (which never happened).I first found out about Katherine Johnson from the TV show Timeless (s01e08 \"Space Race\"), so I'm glad that show brought her to my attention.

            "content": "\"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\" The power of Dr. King's call for equity lies in that simple word: content. Think about it, content is all what makes us equal: blood, heart, feelings and in the case of \"Hidden Figures\": mathematical intelligence.It is very fascinating that the words of Dr. King could find their most powerful resonance earlier than the iconic speech, in 1961, when space was the setting of a two-man race with America as the second. The Mercury program, immortalized by one of the 80's greatest movies \"The Right Stuff\", needed brains to expunge the Sputnik affront and allow the seven astronauts (Glenn, Grissom Shepard and all.) to replicate the exploits of Gagarin and beat the Russians in the ultimate challenge: the moon.By translating the confrontation between America and the Soviet Union to its vast, unexplored and neutral area, space cooled down the war. But it's nonetheless out of the Red Scare and the intolerable implications of these devilish satellites, \"sleeping by the light of a Communist moon\" and such, that the US government spent billions of dollars in the program. America needed to counterattack and quick... no bucks, no \"Buck Rogers\", but you didn't get these Buck Rogers without brains either.So you have two situations remarkably juxtaposed: a Space Task Group, directed by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) pressured to get men in space asap and a Black community fighting for their right to be judged for their competences. Among their most brilliant minds, three women: Dorothy Vaughan, an informal supervisor, Mary Jackson, an aspiring engineer and Katherine G. Johnson, a mathematician, they work in the segregated Computers Division area of a Research Center attached to the NASA. Like Dr. King, they have dreams, collective and individual, and they sure got the 'right stuff' to fulfill them, but maybe not the right color of skin.These three pioneers are in the poster and they're played by Taraji P. Henson (Johnson), Octavia Spencer (Vaughan) and Janelle Mon\u00e0e (Jackson); the presence of Octavia Spencer, the fact that she got her second Oscar-nomination for her role, and the great chemistry within the trio will exude inevitable \"The Help\" vibes. The kinship with the previous 2011 Best Picture nominee also relies on the intertwining stories of women triumphing over segregation by remaining true to themselves. And last but not least, \"Hidden Figures\" also features a 'bathroom' episode which, beyond a light comedic effect, exposes some of the most infuriating aspect of discrimination... and racism.But \"Hidden Figures\" is more than \"The Help\" with glasses (a comparison that made me chuckle), the film retells the main story of \"The Right Stuff\" with a different focus: the pivotal contribution of African-American women for the NASA space program, its most memorable scene features thirty women being transferred to the Programming Department, assigned to work on the new IBM machine and walking like in a civil right march, but not without making a clever nod to the iconic slow-motion astronaut-walking moment in \"The Right Stuff\". Adapted from Margot Lee Shetterly's novel, I would say about \"Hidden Figures\" what I said for \"Hacksaw Ridge\", the greatest merit is to have brought to the big screen a great story for 2016... and a great film.Yes, I can say I enjoyed every bit of Theodore Melfi's film, it's smartness (one of the year's finest screenplays) and its capability to vulgarize complex math problems, its humor (the three actresses are equally witty and fun to watch), its sweetness and I will say its unpredictability. Indeed, when I expected many scenes to pull a \"Butler\" and get too heavy with the racial material, the film surprised me by showing some genuine moments of sweetness and understanding. I particularly enjoyed the way Mary's husband supported her decision to attend night classes to pursue her dreams of becoming an engineer. For dramatization's sake, they could have injected a conflict to make things harder but the restrained and light-hearted tone was right for the film.And we can see the three women go through their parallel paths, Dorothy Vaughan's ambition to become the supervisor, constantly rejected by her own supervisor Vivian, played by an icy and effective Kirsten Dunst, and we see their relationship warm up with time and gaining more respect and consideration. In a marvelously written speech, Janelle Mon\u00e0e must convince a judge to let her attend courses in an all-white school, she pleads her case with a catching passion, using the space program as an argument that nothing is impossible, and there's an obvious parallel between the space dreams of America and the dreams of the black community, things seemingly difficult but not impossible, because it is the essence of America to help people achieving them.And there's the core of the film: Katherine, assigned to assist Mr. Harrison and confronted to a manly and white office place without any bathroom, where she can't share coffee, assist meetings or sign her own reports. Everyone who worked in an office knows exactly what Katherine went through and knew at least one petty supervisor like Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) and it's one of the emotional reward of the film to see her skills and talent finally pay off, earning her the respect of her colleagues, who'd see the content before the container.\"Hidden Figures\" is not just about women and segregation; it's about work, patience and intelligence and what it takes to fulfill one's ambition whether on a personal or a collective level. It might get a bit conventional here and there and as many users pointed out, the lack of smoking deprived it from a small touch of authenticity, but this is a flaw of 'epsilon' level... sorry I had to end with a math reference.",

            "content": "In the early 1960s, a group of black women who work at NASA's Langley Research Center face racism, discrimination and sexism on a daily basis, despite their high qualifications and denied promotion. They eventually prove themselves worthy of recognition, especially under the task force direction of Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) and prove their skills in helping John Glenn's (Glen Powell) mission to space.Despite being presented in a sometimes over sentimental presentation of history rather than letting the events and discrimination speak for itself, this story set in a pre-Civil Rights America does a first class job in highlighting the story of these three brilliant and outstanding black female contributors to the Space Race. Based off book a by Margot Lee Shetterley, despite its sentimentality, it still manages to evade cartoon type characters of the heroes and villains. Although the actresses themselves look nothing like the real women, they accredit themselves in their roles well. Taraji P. Henson plays Katherine Johnson, the most prominent and best known of the women.",

Nothing about it is subtle or subdued, as expected. But it's still a pretty good film. It does its job, is very entertaining, and it also has three very strong leads at its core. It's a story about important women in real life and even though it gets the very Hollywood treatment and doesn't go beyond that to become a great film, it's still hard to fault. It's definitely recommended.",

But the movie tries to condense lot's of truth regarding America and especially the south in the early sixties and yes there was still segregation and the achievements of women and black people were overlooked and downplayed.\nSo on this level the movie worked and was pleasurable to watch.\nOscar winner Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughn a mathematician who develops a talent for programming computers but is denied a supervisory position by her supervisor (Kirsten Dunst). Katherine Johnson.\nJanelle Mon\u00e1e plays Mary Jackson, an aspiring engineer who is held back from becoming an actual engineer due to segregation.\nKevin Costner is the boss who puts his personal prejudices aside for the good of the Space race.\nAll actors did well in this movie and although it was not 100% historically correct it is well worth watching.\nIt does puzzle me why Hollywood feels that they cannot make a watchable historical movie and portray everything accurately.",

            "content": "Before the feminist era, written history was mostly about men while women were by-lines and coloured women non-existent. In the past several decades, women have been reclaiming their place in history and the film Hidden Figures (2016) is part of this cultural change. It is a story that celebrates the achievements of a hitherto un-acknowledged group of women who were called 'coloured computers' before the first mainframe IBM was ready for NASA in the 1960s.Based on real events, the film is set against the Cold War and the frantic race between America and Russia to put the first man on the Moon. More than space science, it was about competing political systems and bragging rights for aeronautical supremacy. The story centres on three gifted coloured women who joined the space program: mathematician Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) audits the calculations of white male scientists and devises new mathematical solutions for trajectory calculations; Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) teaches herself complex Fortran code to become the expert on the IBM computer and NASA's first coloured supervisor; and Mary Johnson (Janelle Monae) wins the right to enrol in a segregated engineering course to become NASA's first coloured female engineer. The trio are part of a scientific group that is under immense political pressure to achieve the successful manned spaceflight which became astronaut John Glenn's space legacy.The historical facts frame the story but it is the treatment of the facts that makes the film interesting. It could have been a tense drama or dry bio-pic but instead it is full of comedic moments and under-stated racial vignettes. For example, on her first day Katherine is mistaken for a janitor and all the coloured women must walk half a mile to use the segregated bathroom. Despite the best available \"white brains\" only a coloured woman can work out the new IBM computer and astronaut John Glenn will not 'lift off' unless Katherine first checks the IBM trajectory calculations. The ironies are not designed to get laughs, but to show how even the nation's finest scientific minds were locked into systemic racial discrimination in a NASA culture that was blind to its own prejudices.This is a great film on many levels. As a bio-pic, it carries the weight of history in telling a story that must be told. The acting is outstanding, with a perfect balance between depicting the ugly side of racial oppression and the women's determination to contribute to aeronautical science. Character development is on the light side as the focus is not on personality but on achievement. The trio of stars all portray dignity under duress and their repressed anger saves the film from turning into a lecture. It achieves what any bio-pic drama can hope for: it offers feel-good entertainment while informing about a remarkable episode in history.",

Thewestchestarian understands this was likely an aberration and that we'll get a $250M Suicide Squad remake for summer 2018 so let's enjoy it while we can. The film features three excellent portrayals of separate but unequal NASA employees trying to contribute their full talents for a nation that treats them pretty shabbily. Also, Kevin Costner puts in an Oscar-worthy performance as a NASA director under enough pressure from the Ruskies to take steps toward providing a more even playing field among the math geniuses under his charge. Apart from an overdone scene where Costner take a crowbar to a sign segregating the women's bathrooms, his character only changes as much as he needs to as shown in scenes when he refers to the now gender and racial integrated group as \"gentlemen\". The movie has some flaws. Katherine G. Johnson's character has 3 children who show up about twice - one is left to wonder how Katherine's long nights at Langley affected them. They movie also succumbs to the Hollywood superstar problem when telling a team story - one that Apollo 13 successfully avoided. Johnson's character is portrayed as the lone person who knows what they are doing while Jim Parsons' character does nothing else but take credit for her work. At one point Costner's character inspires them by pointing out he has assembled the best math geniuses in the country so presumably Parsons' Paul Stafford was making something of a contribution. In short, ultimately, this film is inspirational on several fronts and is the right one for the times and is way better than La La Land.",

            "content": "If you like your American History etched in a simplistic black and white, then perhaps Hidden Figures is for you. But if you require your historical \"cup of tea\" to be much more nuanced, with decided \"shades of gray,\" then this entertaining yarn about three African-American women and their under-appreciated contribution to NASA's space race, might not be the accurate and important film that a majority of the critics and attentive film-goers believe it to be.It's 1961 when Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) and Katherine G Johnson (Taraji P Henson), show up at NASA headquarters located at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. In Director Theodore Melfi's conception, Langley becomes a symbol of the racism of the times but in employing dramatic license, he makes it much worse than it actually was.Take for example the segregated bathroom facilities\u2014they were already eliminated by NASA three years earlier in 1958\u2014so the scene where Kevin Costner's \"Al Harrison\" character utilizes a sledgehammer to take down the \"coloreds only\" sign, never happened. Nor did Katherine Johnson ever go to the segregated toilets\u2014she used the whites only bathroom for years and was only challenged once\u2014and on that occasion she merely ignored the objection and continued using the bathroom unopposed. According to the non-fiction book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly which the film was based on, Johnson was quoted as saying that she was aware of racism but while working at Langley never \"FELT\" it. To her, she was just doing her job. And as far as being barred from joining the special Space Task Group, the truth of the matter was that she received the promotion in 1958 after working in the Flight Research Division for five years, beginning in 1953. She even co-authored a report while part of the Space Task Group in 1960.Unlike Johnson who didn't feel like she was a victim of discrimination, Mary Jackson did indeed have to use separate bathroom facilities before 1958 (although the half a mile hike to get to the bathroom was an exaggeration). She didn't however, have to obtain a court order to take engineering courses\u2014so the dramatic scene before the Judge was again a fictional construct. Instead she merely asked for an exemption and it was granted. And the actual promotion to engineer took place three years earlier\u2014note that this is seven years before the passage of the Civil Rights Act.Much is made in the film of how Dorothy Vaughn was passed over for a promotion to supervisor, opposed by her own supervisor, Mrs. Mitchell, a bigoted white woman who is depicted as patronizing. While Mitchell is a fictional character, it's even more shocking to learn that Dorothy became a supervisor in 1948! She also joined an integrated team in 1958, the year that NASA's name was changed from its previous acronym\u2014 NACA (The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics).Jim Parsons rounds out the film's collection of composite characters, playing the head engineer, Paul Stafford. He's there not as a symbol of racism but of male chauvinism\u2014he's insistent on preventing Katherine from entering the room where the all-male Pentagon briefings are held.Hidden Figures fulfills its well- intentioned, feel-good mission as it chronicles Katherine Johnson's role in the early space missions, as she provides complex mathematical calculations for Alan Shepherd's first US manned flight and John Glenn's first orbit of the earth.The point of course is that the contributions of African-Americans to American history have often been ignored and the film's scenarists rightfully are determined to set the record straight and provide recognition where recognition has been long so overdue. In that respect, the film has accomplished a worthwhile goal.The highly attractive Taraji P Henson, donning eyeglasses, steals the show as the former child prodigy, who proves to her colleagues that race and gender are no impediment to performing a job well done\u2014especially when that job entails understanding those complex set of mathematical calculations beyond the scope of the average person.The curmudgeon in me recognizes the bigger picture here involving the space race\u2014what some discerning critics might classify as a \"sacred cow.\" While I don't want to disparage the contributions of such brave individuals as John Glenn\u2014it's necessary to recognize there's something much more sinister afoot here\u2014and that is man's capacity for self-deception.After all the space program really is a relic\u2014In the early 60s, everything was geared toward putting a man on the moon. We managed to accomplish that\u2014planting the flag, collecting a few rocks\u2014but after that, everything has been anti-climactic. Indeed, we are no closer to answering the age-old question, are we alone in the universe?I was shocked to see Katherine Johnson at the Academy Awards recently. Sitting in her wheelchair, it appeared time has certainly taken its toll on the once vibrant mathematician. The necessity and satisfaction in acknowledging minority contributions to our overall history pales in comparison to recognizing the fact of our inviolability of life here on earth\u2014the rock group Kansas put it best when they sung, we'll all be soon like \"dust in the wind.\"",

Melfi also co-wrote the screenplay, with first time feature screenwriter Allison Schroeder, and it's based on the book (of the same name) by Margot Lee Shetterly. The film stars Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae, Octavia Spencer, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali and Glen Powell. It tells the true story of the brilliant African- American mathematician Katherine Johnson, and her two colleagues, who helped John Glenn become the first American to completely orbit the Earth (while they worked segregated at Langley). The movie has received almost unanimously rave reviews from critics, and it's a hit at the Box Office. I really enjoyed it as well.The film takes places in the 1960s; at a time when America was desperately trying to get ahead in the 'Space Race' with the Soviet Union. Katherine Johnson (Henson), and her two friends, Mary Jackson (Monae) and Dorothy Vaughan (Spencer), worked at Langley; in the segregated West Area Computers division. Despite dealing with heavy racism, and the lack of true credit for their work, the three women helped John Glenn (Powell) become the first American astronaut to make a complete orbit of Earth. This movie passionately tells their little known story.The film has multiple really good scenes in it; that are extremely emotional, inspiring and quite moving. The performances are all really good; especially Henson, Monae and Costner (Costner is a great actor, he should be getting a lot more work). While the movie is really well made, and very touching, it's still just a little too Hollywood manufactured for me. Melfi is a very talented filmmaker though ('ST. VINCENT' is a really good movie as well), he just needs the studios to let him have complete creative freedom of his work. It's almost a truly great film, but not quite.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is the story of three little known women who played a crucial role in the early days of the US space program. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e were all wonderful in their roles; each bringing specific personalities to their characters.Taraji P. Henson is a mathematics wunderkind who is called upon to assist in calculating the math requires for launches and recoveries. A single mother of three daughters, she graciously and calmly works through the difficulties of being a lone black woman in a department full of white men in the racially segregated state of Virginia. Her calmness breaks in one scene and she wonderfully states, quite loudly, the obstacles she is forced to endure and overcome. This is quite a contrast from her normally calm dignity. As a side story, she is also involved in a burgeoning romantic relationship and she shows another totally side of herself - that of a shy, demure woman, which she carries off perfectly.Octavia Spencer, a very strong actress, does a wonderful job as a black woman with the responsibilities of a supervisor that she is not allowed to have the title or compensation for. She deals with her supervisor, Kirsten Dunst, with patience and tolerance and delivers what I think was the finest line in the film in response to Dunst's comment that, \"I have nothing against y'all.\" Spencer replies, \"I know you probably believe that.\" Surrounding me in the auditorium was a subdued murmur of knowing assent and acknowledgment from the audience. Clearly, the black moviegoers all have had that thought, probably more often than one would like to think. As a white male, the sounds of the audience gave me pause and had great impact. That line, alone, made this movie worth seeing.Janelle Mon\u00e1e plays a woman with the talent to be a NASA engineer, who has to jump through hoops to get there. She provides the bit of lightness that keeps this film lighter than the topic may generally have dictated.Without exception, the supporting cast excels - from Kevin Costner, the boss who just wants to get the job done and tolerates no impediments; to Jim Parsons, the engineer who always insists on following the rules - NASA's as well as his personal rules based on his biases; to Mahershala Ali, who plays Henson's love interest.This movie is well worth viewing on many levels - as history, as a treatise on segregation and race relations, and as an example of how determination can overcome the most difficult of obstacles.Not only was this an excellent film; it was also a film that I was glad I saw.",

And do some research to check some details - love the Internet.Yes, I know the film is not a documentary, I know that there is such a thing as dramatic licence and artistic licence and so forth, but this was not, as advertised, a \"dramatic biopic\"; it was fairytale. The impact was doubled by the hideous dumbing-down of everything. Everything was a caricature. There are no real, 3-D people in this film. There are only goodies and baddies. The goodies are always right, and the baddies are always wrong. In fact, some of the goodies have magical powers and do things that are ridiculous and impossible - sort of the cerebral equivalent of action heroes in a Chuck Norris film, I suppose. There are 2 speaking part baddies who get redemption at the end of the film by seeing the error of their ways and finally behaving nicely. Ta-dah! Redemption level achieved. Lesson learned. Example set. Didn't see that coming, did you?The central theme is that both black people (\"coloreds\") and women were treated unequally at the time in the US, and the film lays this on with a trowel. And then a shovel. And then a series of dump trucks. OK, the film-maker is entitled to emphasis his point, and these things were true in many aspects of everyday life, and this would be a fair enough take, except for one important thing. The average viewer would come away thinking that racial segregation was endemic at NASA, which is actually the opposite of the truth. NASA was a federally-mandated equal opportunity employer (one of the first), and in fact, set up by Johnson that way to provide opportunities for education, employment and advancement for blacks. There were no segregated workplaces at NASA. Yes, there had been, years before, at NACA, but by 1961, they were long gone. Yes, there was one \"Colored Women's Bathroom\" (left over from the old NACA days) at Langley, but it wasn't 1/2 a mile away, and the sign wasn't dramatically knocked down with a tyre iron in front of a breathless audience by the head of NASA (or Kevin Costner). As usual, the truth was more prosaic. Its existence was mostly ignored, and the sign was eventually removed with a memo. Apparently this tyre iron scene in the film had US audiences cheering. Cheering. Did they think it was real? Or even remotely likely? The logic wouldn't fool a 12 year old.While this film provides, apparently, many uplifting moments, I found it so contrived and false and wrong (unintentionally in many places) that I was alternating between outraged gasps and laughing out loud. I know that this is a common experience for those of us with an interest in history, but there is one difference here: many of the the people who worked there at the time are still around, and they must love that they're all being painted as misogynistic racists.\nMost people don't read books or even articles. The film is what they will think was the truth. That's sad.\nI could list all the distortions, exaggerations, and stupid scientific/factual errors in this film, but that will have to wait until I have a few hours spare. In the meantime, look under the Goofs section, and you will see over 100 of them.\nThe Director really let go of the rope on this one.The story of these women is a good one.

            "content": "How many hidden human beings are behind every important project? A lot! Why we didn't hear about the amazing achievements of these three incredible brilliant women until now it's something that makes me both angry and sad. The movie is brilliant, sensitive, and funny. It touches many different issues: segregation in the 60s, women rights, motherhood, racism, solidarity, physics, maths, and spaceships! The casting is superb, the music is great, and the stories are breathtaking. I was juts thrilled to see a video of NASA where they have a talk with the amazing cast of Hidden Figures. The moderator says: \"In the 1960s NASA was on an ambitious journey to the moon, and the human computers portrayed in 'Hidden Figures' helped to get us there. Hidden Figures is a ... movie based on actual events. While the film dramatizes some aspects, it is true at the struggles of the women at the center of the story: Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. The victories for racial and gender rights were not achieve easily or quickly, and our work is not done\" (you can see this video on the net, look for the NASA channel).This movie is a jewel for all ages. I will definitely take my older kids (10 and 8 years old) to see it, because I always talk to them about the dangers of racism and how rotten racism and sexism is, and they love spaceships. At the end of the film all the cinema clapped. I'm Spanish and Spanish people tend to do what they feel, we are loud and emotional, but I didn't see a clap like that in a long time.

            "content": "Hidden Figures is one story that needed to be told. One thing is that we as Americans never tire of a good movie about how we became the world's preeminent space explorers, but the human story is what makes it truly compelling. Within that element there's many stories of which this amazing one is a crucial part most folks weren't aware of. It's how a group of talented female colored mathematicians contributed so much. Of that group were three whose contributions were of mission critical importance. This is their story.Hidden Figures elegantly, and compactly, tells how Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson, three young black women, became iconic technical experts in NASA. The world in the early sixties was anything but colorblind but these three women's talents made NASA begin and continue to change. They truly made the space race race-less. It's something almost as remarkable as what they contributed to getting us to the moon. It must have been about as trailblazing and unfriendly. But like NASA itself they persevered. Hidden Figures respectfully tells the true story highlights in just two hours.As a viewer and an American I find this movie uplifting and very positive. Director Theodore Melfi doesn't waste a scene. There's no dead air or boring side stories here as the movie moves at a brisk pace that just gets better. The blending of period and current cinematography is excellent. Without nitpicking details the sixties is well recreated. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae are uniformly excellent as Johnson, Vaughn, and Jackson. Ms. Henson is especially compelling in her performance as Katherine Johnson. I've enjoyed Ms. Henson in everything I've seen her in and she truly shines here and does an iconic woman's story justice. Supporting her are Kevin Costner as her boss and Jim Parsons as her reluctant supervisor. They bring the right tension and stay out of eclipsing the story otherwise. This is perfect casting aiding to bring a story to life with the impact it deserves. Overall Hidden Figures is an excellent movie telling an important, largely unknown, story as it so richly deserves. This is a reminder of why a colorblind society is so vitally important. Within true equality, acceptance, and cooperation getting to the moon and all things beyond become reality. Highly recommended.",

Or alternatively, it could have veered too much into feel-good mode. Instead, it just tells the great story of how in the early 1960s, three courageous, super- intelligent African American women overcame massive prejudices and social conventions to succeed as important contributors to the NASA space program. Given that most of the audience is not into high level math and physics, the writers explain everything beautifully - way better than in A Beautiful Mind or The Imitation Game. The casting is near-perfect, with Taraji Henson giving an awesome performance as genius mathematician Katherine Johnson, who is not only smart and bold but has many other interesting facets to her life, like finding love again after her first husband died. Janelle Monae, as engineer Mary Jackson, and Octavia Spencer as computer expert Dorothy Vaughan, are both brilliant in portraying equally determined characters in their fields. Kevin Costner is great as their sparky but demanding boss, Al Harrison. Established stars Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst have the grace and humility to play quite negative characters in this movie, who blanche at giving the black women a chance, but who eventually do thaw a little in their attitudes. The clothes are a costume designer's dream, but as with the film's set design and music, everything is nicely understated. I was pleased to note that the real Katherine Johnson was still alive when this film came out. Hidden Figures is made with love and affection, and it's a fitting tribute to those pioneer NASA women.",

Skilled mathematicians all, they took the theoretical equations of the white male engineers and turned them into workable data, often on the fly and always subject to last-minute revisions. \"Hidden Figures\" is a paean to black female nerds, a generally overlooked demographic in American media, and the film's major through-line is the heroine's gathering confidence as she struggles to be accepted by the white male analysts of the Space Task Group. Outstanding piece of work by Taraji Henson and Octavian Spencer justifying their performances as Black Negroes. The film's made with more heart than art and more skill than subtlety, and it works primarily because of the women that it portrays and the actresses who portray them. It deserves to make as much money as other big budget movies does. I do admit that it is one of the best films of 2016 and an Oscar Bait for outstanding performances.

The U.S. and Russia are competing in almost every way, including the race against each other for priority in space.NASA was headquartered at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Virginia. Even though this was federal property, discrimination against Blacks was routine. As I watched the film, I thought about the levels of discrimination that we see. Of course, there's always the threat of physical violence. (We get a short glimpse of police violence against Blacks in the movie.) Hampton, Virginia, was, indeed, the site of physical violence against Blacks in the 1960's. (In fact, it still is.)However, there were other levels of discrimination. Some were petty, but still humiliating, such as making a Black woman use a \"Colored\" coffee pot. Others were far more severe-- keeping Blacks from being promoted to positions of authority within NASA. Some were even worse--telling a Black woman that she could only apply for engineering school if she took some pre-engineering courses at a nearby school. The only problem was that the school was still Whites only.Three highly talented Black women set out to overcome the discrimination and provide NASA with mathematical help that the organization desperately needs. These women--all of whom did, indeed, work for NASA--were Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. (Portrayed by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e.) Henson, Spencer, and Mon\u00e1e are fine actors, and they do well as individuals, and as a group. The plot of the movie revolves around their attempts to get treated fairly at their work site.Kevin Costner does a good-enough job as Al Harrison, the NASA Director. Kirsten Dunst does an excellent job as Vivian Mitchell, who is in middle management. She's officious, uncaring, and very White. When the women complain to her, she just gives them a false smile and says, \"Well, that's NASA.\" She doesn't make the rules, but she doesn't try to change them either.People have called Hidden Figures a \"feel-good movie,\" which in some respects it is. On the other hand, who can feel good about the racism in our society, then and now?This is an important movie, but not because it makes you feel good. I think the message is that some highly talented people can break through prejudice and prove just how good they are at what they do. That opens the way for other highly talented--and less talented--people to follow them.We saw this film on the large screen, but it will work well on DVD. It's a worthwhile movie and definitely worth seeing.",

I really wanted to go into this movie and learn about these women, but because the writers and directors cared more about telling us all about events and ideologies we already knew about, I can't even remember their names after just getting out of the theater. Here are some examples of how they overly drill in that racism is bad, just in case we didn't already know, all while adding nothing to the story: -A scene with anti-segregation protesters being attacked by police with dogs -News report about the firebombing of a freedom riders bus -Mother and child just about running away from a water fountain when a black man uses the one next to theirs -A sarcastic remark about racism/sexism from one of the main characters every few seconds -About five scenes where a black person walks into a room full of white people, and they all stop and stare at the black person In a documentary about racism and segregation during the civil rights movement, all of those would fit perfectly in, but in this movie, they just add to the run time and force you to have to search for the few times where the movie teaches us anything about the titular hidden figures.I desperately wanted to like this movie, but all in all, I have to give this movie a 3/10 because this movie doesn't care about the main character's achievements, just their race.",

Meaning no disrespect, I would say that it is something like a cross between the old Spencer Tracy-Katherine Hepburn *Desk Set* and the more recent *Imitation Game*. It tells the story of three VERY hard-working and intelligent women who, at the cost of giving up much of their personal lives, managed to accomplish great things.It's a lot more than that, actually. It's the story of three individuals - women, in this case - who, when faced with being rendered obsolete at work because of changes in technology, refused to just accept \"the inevitable\" and complain about it. Instead they put in a great deal of time and effort to retrain and refashion themselves - and others - so that they can \"stay ahead of the curve.\" To say that these three women could well serve as models for everyone in the workforce, whatever their race or sex, would not be an overstatement.Like *The Imitation Game*, it faces the problem of creating an interesting movie about individuals who work with numbers and computers in complicated ways that most of us do not understand. The script might have done a better job of making us appreciate that these are exceptional women, not just by telling us that, as it does at the end, but by finding ways of showing us that. It spends a lot of time showing us their domestic lives; it could have spent more time showing us their intellectual lives, showing us how these women were intellectually exceptional. The opening scene shows us that Dorothy Vaughan can fix a car engine, but that doesn't prepare us for her ability to master Fortran on her own. When, in the closing credits, we learn that the real Ms. Vaughan was a remarkable computer wiz, we're really not prepared for that.--------------------------For what it's worth, I found the blurb provided by the distributor, 20th Century Fox, to be very misleading. Here it is, with my comments in parentheses:\"As the United States raced against Russia to put a man in space, NASA found untapped talent in a group of African-American female mathematicians that served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in U.S. history. (Well, these women did do wonderful things, but they were not \"the brains\" behind the space program. That's a severe exaggeration.)Based on the unbelievably true life stories of three of these women (The story is not by any means \"unbelievable\" - much less \"unbelievably true.\" Why is it unbelievable that these women, despite many obstacles, could achieve such impressive things?)known as \"human computers\", (no, they were not known as \"human computers.\" They were known as \"computers,\" people who computed.)we follow these women as they quickly rose the ranks of NASA alongside many of history's greatest minds (Ah, no! That is the very substance of the whole movie, which the pr guy who wrote this must not have seen. These women, despite their very real talents, did NOT rise quickly. They kept being told that because they were women, and black, that they could NOT rise the way the white men they worked for did.)specifically tasked with calculating the momentous launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, and guaranteeing his safe return. Dorothy Vaughn, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Johnson crossed all gender, race, and professional lines (True, but they only start to do so at the very end of the movie.) while their brilliance and desire to dream big, beyond anything ever accomplished before by the human race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true American heroes.\" (And here, of course, is the biggest \"mistake\" of them all. These women are completely unknown today. Unjustly so, certainly, which is why it is good to have this movie. But up until now, they have had NO place in American history.)",

            "content": "There had been not a few movies about mathematical genius, real-life or fictional (\"A beautiful mind\", \"The man who knew infinity\", \"Good Will Hunting\", \"Proof\" just to name a few) but none like this one. \"Hidden figures\" is set at a time half a century ago with a convergence of three history-shaping events: the US-USSR space race, the Civil Rights Movement and the dawn of the computer age (when the term \"computer\" was switched from denoting a human being to denoting a machine).Just as in Mozart's \"The magic flute\" the magic number of three is key. The three protagonists are three black women (at the time when, unlike today, the word \"black\" had demeaning connotations) each with a dream, an impossible dream it might appear at the time. The movie starts with their car stranding on their way to report to NASA to work. The typical white cop who comes to their aid eyes them with suspicion, almost disbelief upon being shown their NASA identifications. Then, he cringes his head towards the sky as the three bewildered women follow his example. It becomes evident that his hatred for Russians (their satellite up there spying on us) far outweighs his dislike of Blacks and he ends up escorting the three women to NASA.Dorothy Vaughan (veteran Oscar winner Octavia Spencer) has been repeatedly denied her promotion to a vacant supervisor position (which she has in effect been filling for a year) by her boss (Kirsten Dunst) who is all cool officialdom and by-the-book. When the first \"IBM\" (room-size and a capacity of, I guess, 32 or 64 bytes) finds its way into NASA, it is Dorothy, mastering FORTRAN by self-taught, that manages to get it started. Katherine G. Johnson (husband's name acquired in wedding we witness in the movie) is the mathematical genius whose calculations John Glenn (scene-stealing Glen Powell) trusts only (a bit of artistic dramatization, I suspect). While depiction of discrimination is seen with all three women, hers is the most visual, in mad rushes to the segregation bathroom quarter of a mile away, until the big boss Al Harrison (a seasoned, measured performance by Kevin Costner) steps in to do something about it. Quite stereotyped is her immediate boss played by Jim Parsons. On the home front, she is a widow with three darlings of a daughter, and a courtship by Colonel Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali) culminating in one of the best proposal scenes I have seen in movies.Mary Jackson (a very cute, cheeky Janelle Monae) should have been an engineer if she were a white man. With her supporting husband (Aldis Hodge) and kids, she fights for it and finally wins. The movie ends with an upbeat high note of John Glenn's historical space launch.Racial problems are depicted in some movies with gut-wrenching violence. Here, the approach taken is completely non-violent. Battles are won with reasoning and perseverance. Discrimination is depicted sometimes even with light-hearted humour, or stoic endurance. There is nothing wrong with either approach, seen as cinematic art.This is a movie that cannot earn a Best Acting award simply because there is no lead part. Most deservingly, it won the Best Ensemble Cast award from Screen Actors Guild. Spencer is nominated for Best Supporting for both Golden Globe (did not win) and Oscar (to be seen). Henson and Monae have not attracted any individual major award nominations. Ali has a Best Supporting nomination, not for this movie, but for his role in \"Moonlight\", for both Oscar and Golden Globe. Costner put is a good performance for a sympathetic role. Kirsten Dunst (Cannes Best Actress winner. a rare honour for Hollywood) also put in a good performance, but for a thankless job. The remainder in the award-winning ensemble cast list are aforementioned Parsons, Powell and Hodge.",

            "content": "I completely concur with Leslie Jones on the January 21, 2017 News Update on Saturday Night Live: Why the hell isn't this taught in schools?This movie is absolutely brilliant and I'm not just talking about a story concerning geniuses. It more than successfully took on Women's Right Issues, Segregation and sad computer advancement without harping, demeaning or overstaying its welcome on either subcategory while simultaneously honoring all the people involved. Most racial-devoted movies about the 60s take on one issue. Again, this knew it existed, spoke about it, battled against it and still moved the overall story to where it needed to be. It felt genuine and real. Plus, you couldn't help but feel the strain on these characters for the other tremendous odds stacked against them.Getting that out of the way \u2013 the story and well-written script, which happens to be my favorite aspect of any film, the cast is incredible. The three leads, Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Octavia Spencer were amazing. This is not discounting the incredible performance from the fourth main character played by Kevin Costner, but these three awesome ladies deserve awards individually. Taraji P. Henson is the main lead, so I can see her nominated and would wish her a win. The problem is the two other actors, Spencer and Mon\u00e1e. Both equally good and both deserve the supporting actress Academy Award.The movie worked for me. It absolutely had \"Oscar\" moments, some I teared up in, some the waterworks couldn't be held back. So, if they were trying to \"over-dramatize\" actual events to tug at our hearts, well, it worked on me.The story involves some prodigies who work for NASA in the space race with Russia and their struggles to (as stated above) to prove themselves in a duel-water fountain, back of the bus, women can't be (fill in the blank) world. It was never easy and mercifully there are opposite people, as shown here, that either cannot tolerate separation or change once shown the light. It's just the right thing to do; the right action to take!So sad this movie took place almost 60 years ago and we're still dealing with the same issues. Russia's huge involvement in America, women's equality and, of course, racism. There's a tense scene in the beginning that involves a white cop coming across our three black leads. It did have me on edge and made me incredibly depressed that while they had to do their best to not have the cop beat or arrest (or worse) them back then, this kind of tension still exists today.I applaud this movie. It needed to be made and now shown in schools. Taught, if nothing else. Since we're criminally still a divided country, more education and achievements need to be educated to our youths. Check out Leslie Jones' absolutely hilarious movie \"review\" of this on the January 21, 2017 Saturday Night Live episode. While she was funny as heck, she is so right. THIS NEEDS TO BE OUT THERE. More need to see it. And it should\u0085no NEEDS to win awards so more are aware.And beyond my soapbox\u0085it was still one helluva movie! Go see it!!***Final thoughts: Yes, I am aware of the #oscarsowhite campaign last year: 2015. I was, sadly, indifferent until I saw the movie that sparked it all. While Concussion wasn't a great movie, it was still pretty good and had Will Smith's most outstanding performance of his career. I was totally onboard then for the movement. And I know of this phobia the voters have firsthand. As \"Liberal\" as everyone makes Hollywood out to be, it still can be backwards. In my case, it's homophobia. They're batshit against gay cinema and, not that I wish anyone to pass on, but I cannot wait for the up and coming next generation to wipe out both homophobia and the obvious racial discrimination of this dying group. That all said, I really loved both Hidden Figures and Moonlight. I am not pushing them towards the top of my 2016 best list just to squash the #oscarsowhite controversy. They're solid movies on their own. I do, however, hope they are soon to become more mainstream because the two movie's messages need to be heard.",

            "content": "This is now one of my all-time favorite movies, in part, because the accomplishments of these three women were not mentioned in the educational process for much of my generation. Realizing what each of these three women accomplished was very moving. I was brought to tears a few times.I graduated from high school just two years after the Challenger Shuttle disaster but there was no mention in school of those critical to NASA advancing so far to begin with. I have never identified with the \"Generation X\" label but I was aware that it was the first generation that never faced accepted segregation. My senior class was the largest in the state that year and our valedictorian was African-American. One our most popular student athletes was African-American also. We didn't have a lot of minority students but the only incident I can recall that may have involved race was in junior high school. One day, a bully was picking on a friend of mine who was Asian. The bully soon realized he made a mistake as my friend slipped off his shoes and got in a fighting stance. He was skilled in martial arts. The bully wanted nothing to do with him after that.If this movie had been made sooner, it may have won several Oscars. It certainly deserved at least one.Aside from the dramatic scenes involving the re-entry of Friendship 7 and the fate of Colonel John Glenn, my favorite scene was Kevin Costner's character ripping down the sign for the colored restroom so Katherine didn't have to be away from her desk so long several times each day. The look on the face of the law enforcement officer was priceless.The only possible negative was the portrayal of Katherine being brought back in at Glenn's request to confirm the correct coordinates as launch of the rocket appears imminent. The film portrays this as a race against the clock but NASA wasn't going ahead with the launch until Glenn was satisfied that the person he considered to be the smartest (Katherine) was satisfied. The dramatic moment of Glenn confirming the coordinates with Katherine observing was not realistic. Research shows there were many delays or pauses with Friendship 7, including after the launch countdown had started. In reality, it may have been more of a \"it's about time!\" feeling.That was not enough for me to deduct even one star. This is a great movie. I recorded it on my DVR and I will keep it until I get it on DVD.",

We follow three black women who work at NASA, aiming for their dreams and suffering through the oppression that black people went through during the 60s. This really opened my eyes to the oppression black people went through. I've heard of it before but never really knew how bad it was until I watched this movie. It was terrible and the things that people go through in this movie? There are still people alive today that went through this. This really was still quite recent. It's mind blowing to think about, really. Our characters are three strong black women that don't take crap and it's beautiful. They hold their heads up high and do not allow the oppression to get to them. They do what they can in what they're provided and they kick ass. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e gave absolutely beautiful performances and they are definitely some actresses to watch out for. I can't wait to see what else they bring to film. I actually did a lot of research into Friendship 7 before watching this, and the plot was really true to fact. It's really wonderful to see that the script writers and such did a lot of research into the events that happened. The cinematography in this movie was stunning. I was really taken aback by how wonderful it was and the film creators did an absolutely amazing job with it. I would gladly watch this movie over and over again. My only qualm was that the timing seemed to just phase and we were supposed to know immediately. These few times really threw me off and it took me time to reconnect to the movie and realised what was happening. Other than this, the movie was absolutely stunning. A definite 9.5/10 from me for sure.",

Just look up the Saturn V rocket. Its the rocket that took us to the moon and it was created by two German American former nazi's. History is more important than propaganda. So now we know that German ex nazi's and black women helped put us into space.

To be honest, I had this fear that the film would portray white characters as sinister with few of them having a sense of fairness and tolerance. I think that fear was avoided. There's nothing quite so annoying has a movie that's theme seems to be to combat discrimination and racism only to use its own brand of racism in the process.Anyway, it was an uplifting film. I did chuckle when John Glenn, in full space gear, was walking to the lauchpad moments from lift-off when he gets a telephone call telling him that the math was correct and he would land at the predetermined splashdown point. I don't think astronauts would get last minute directions on where exactly they are going to go.",

So John Glenn all suited up in his space suit, is delaying the rocket launch sequence, standing by the rocket, waiting by the phone for the brilliant black girl to call and confirm the trajectory.

One does not need to understand the complex mathematical equations shown in this film to find it enjoyable. It is a simple feel-good story that helps shine a light on the pivotal contributions of three overlooked heroes.The film is based on the true story of female African-American mathematicians Katherine Goble (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e), who played important roles in NASA's space program in the early 1960s. Despite the discrimination and racial segregation occurring within this time period, the three African-American women manage to prove to everyone that they are more than capable of helping put astronauts into outer space.Despite its predictable outcome and some moments of sensationalism, Hidden Figures still feels nice to watch mainly because of the positive message it portrays; that no matter what opposition you may face, keep working hard to prove yourself and you will eventually earn the respect you deserve. The three African-American actresses all gave great performances. The segregated world of the 1960s is shown to full effect, as the three women endure prejudice and injustice, and as a result, the viewer can't help but cheer for them throughout their struggles.I rate it 7.5/10",

Great directions by Theo Melfi.Initially, I was going to wait later to see this movie. I was not aware of this real life story brought to the screen for all to see. The three lead actresses are all great in their roles. I just saw pretty singer turned actress, Janelle Monae in the film \"Moonlight\" two weeks ago.But I have been watching pretty and talented Taraji Henson for several years in such films as \"I Can Do Bad By Myself\", \"No Good Deed\", \"Think Like a Man 1&2\", Karate Kid (remake)and several others. Taraji has Always done a great job. I think she is finally in the ranks of her Caucasian/White counterpart actresses, Julia Roberts and the great Meryl Streep. Without a doubt, Taraji deserves an academy award as best actress. However, I have seen that sometimes after an African American wins the great gold Oscar statue, it still does Not guarantee the black actor/actress will work a lot. That is with the exception of the great Denzel Washington who has won two Oscars and still works as much as he did prior to winning.Kevin(The Bodyguard)Costner is equally good as the head honcho standing between fairness equality and racism and Jim Parsons, pretty Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman) are good as racist bosses. One of the scenes that I was so happy to see that really touched me when Kevin Costner tore down the \"Colored\" sign above the door and ripped the label on the coffee pot, as well as when Taraji as Katherine and Octavia as Dorothy made their first progress to show their racist supervisors how smart and intelligent not only African Black Americans are, but also proving that intelligence is genderless as well. I admired Janelle's \"Mary\" as the cocky standup for herself role, but also knowing that in that time period, such an arrogant mouth would have gotten her in serious trouble with the racist bigoted Caucasian/Whites.Myself, having been in the active army and active army reserves, I feel the actor, Glen Powell as astronaut John Glenn was cast to young to be have been a full bird army colonel, but this is a Hollywood movie based on a real life story that took place many years ago.Great movie, let's see more like this to show racist people in this great country and other countries that Africans and African Americans are Not all in gangs, on drugs, in prisons or lazy. A lot are: teachers {my oldest son, Alex}, lawyers, doctors, military generals, political leaders, airplane & helicopter mechanics {my youngest son, Sullas}, talented singers, actors/actresses and sports hall of famers. We need more positive movies about Hispanics/Latinos and Asians such as the great film \"Stand and Deliver\" starring Edward J.

A man had never gone to space until he did, and a woman's place was at home until it started being at an office or whatever it is she wishes. Hidden Figures reminds us of that (we already know, but I guess sometimes people like to forget..). It's based on true facts so it's easy to believe it. It's not ambitious , it doesn't intend to be more then what it was, but still an interesting story, given life with the right amount of drama and a nice soundtrack.

            "content": "One would think that NASA would be a government institution that would be immune from the social upheavals of the early 1960s. But in that period of time, three distinguished African American women from Hampton, Virginia named Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson, all of whom were incredible geniuses at crunching complex math problems, did indeed shake things up there, fighting not only institutionalized racism but also a touch of misogyny as well. At the same time, it was what these three women did that helped America's manned space program take flight by 1962, and set us on a course towards the Apollo 11 manned landing on the Moon in 1969. Their story is brilliantly told in the film HIDDEN FIGURES, based on the book of the same name by Margot Lee Sheterly.Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janaelle Monae portray, respectively, Johnson, Vaughn, and Jackson, three women who, as young girls in a much more ultra-segregated South of the mid-1920s, displayed such an extreme aptitude for complex algebra and calculus that got them jobs at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia in 1961. Being incredibly quick at complex math problems that are involved in getting the space program in a position where it could challenge the achievements of the Soviet Union, however, doesn't count for much when they are still made painfully aware of their \"place\" (separate bathrooms and coffee pots) in a profession that, though becoming a technological juggernaut, is still stuck in an unsavory past. This is what they face from co-workers like those portrayed by Kirstin Dunst and Jim Parsons, though Kevin Costner (portraying NASA station chief Al Harrison) is duly impressed with their skill in calculating all the complexities of launches, orbits, and splashdown angles. The work of the three women takes on added urgency when, on April 17, 1961, Yuri Gagarin becomes the first human being to venture beyond Earth's atmosphere, putting the Soviets well ahead of America, while NASA's Atlas and Redstone rockets either keep going off course or blowing up on the launch pad. For Costner, this means that their work is essential, because he himself must take a lot of the heat from the powers-that-be in Washington for the enormous expenditures that NASA is incurring in such a risky proposition.The moment of truth comes on February 20, 1962 when, through Henson's lightning calculations, astronaut John Glenn is launched into space in the Friendship 7 space capsule. He manages to get through three orbits; but then, he and the ground crew receive indications that his heat shield may fail upon re-entry. Once more, Henson is put in charge of coming up with a quick solution to hopefully stop Glenn from burning up in the atmosphere, while the entire world holds its collective breath.What HIDDEN FIGURES tells is a story that only a handful of Americans, if any at all, have ever known about because of all the political and social tumult that went on during the 1960s. Henson, Spencer, and Monae have the tough jobs of portraying the three women's personality quirks, while trying gamely to hide their rage at being so slowly accepted by the white and (with the exception of Dunst) male NASA hierarchy because of being African-American women with sky-high IQ's. They give incredible performances in their roles, as does Costner in what, for any other actor, would seem to be a relatively minor role of the NASA director who is oblivious to his workplace's antiquated caste system until it interferes with America's ability to catch up with the Soviets.Theodore Melfi, who directed the quirky 2014 comedy drama ST. VINCENT, handles the proceedings quite well, getting solid performances from his cast, including Parsons (best known as the head \"geek\" on TV's \"The Big Bang Theory\"); and the film does a good idea at not only taking a pointed look at institutionalized racism, but also mocking it (especially in the ironic and funny opening sequence of an old white Virginia state trooper escorting the three women to Langley a few minutes in). HIDDEN FIGURES is not only a great film for its true-life story, but also a reminder of how much African Americans have always contributed to the greatness of our nation, a fact we still need to be reminded about in the 21st century.",

The movie has received major figures at the box office, and is nominated for several Oscar nominations including Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Motion Picture. \"Hidden Figures\" is based on the true story of three African- American women who provided some major mathematical data needed for NASA to help launch off America's first successful space missions in the early 60's. However, the main figure of this flick is the math wiz Katherine Johnson, admirably played by Taraji P. Henson. Octavia Spencer does provide some help here as Dorothy Vaughn, who was very instrumental in NASA's IBM management. Uprising star Janelle Monae plays Mary Jackson, the lively NASA engineer-to-be who fights the court in order to be enrolled in a all-white school. These were the 60's so Director Theodore Melfi does incorporate the themes of civil rights, segregation, and gender differences within his filmmaking mission of \"Hidden Figures\". Kevin Costner dazzles as the NASA Supervisor Al Harrison. Did not get much of a thespian big bang from Jim Parson's performance as the bullyish NASA engineer Paul Stafford. And \"Moonlight\" star Mahershala Ali moonlights here also as Johnson's beau Colonel Jim Johnson; but was not in \"Moonlight\" fantastic mode. Spencer did receive a Best Supporting Actress performance for a character that was not much of a blast in this space movie; so yea, I thought it was a fine performance but don't think it warranted a nomination. Don't get me wrong, \"Hidden Figures\" does have feel-good qualities and plays a well-deserved homage to these ladies who were such an addition to NASA's progress. \"Hidden Figures\" does rock it at times, but its not a perfect cinematic mission. **** Good",

            "content": "For his second feature film, Theodore Melfi tries this time to deal with a more serious topic: the role of black women in the American society in early 60's. This is how we meet Katherine Goble, a gifted woman, working as a \"computer\" in the Langley Research Center and two of her colleagues and friends Mary Jackson, yearning for a engineer position and Dorothy Vaughan an unofficial supervisor. All along the movie, we will see how women had to work hard to establish theirselves and gain recognition in the male-dominated engineering world.This is for the plot, now let's go deeper into this movie. Actually, there is nothing fundamentally wrong in this movie, everything is just OK. But making a film about segregation and misogyny does not make necessarily a good movie. And here is the evidence. During the two hours of this movie we will witness all forms of discrimination but nothing more that we've seen dozens of times. Unlike some other movies, such as Fences for example, where these sensitive topics were dealt with subtlety we are here just talking about discrimination to give substance to the movie.That aside, the story behind the movie aims to show the work of NASA engineers and computers during the 60's star wars between Americans and Russians. Once again, in order to wow the spectators, characters just throw us mathematical formulas and spatial jargon all along the movie. But when you have a better look on it you can just see trivia or nonsense formulas. It is a common way in movies to try to impress spectators with non sense jargon, and this movie is not an exception.Eventually, there are all the same some good things with this movie. It allows us to have a better understanding about these hidden figures who were at the root of American space conquest and it is also a way to acknowledge the value of their work. Besides the acting and the filmmaking are good enough.To conclude, even though the screen writing remains interesting I think that this story would have been a better documentary than a movie.",

Despite all of the prejudice that is levied upon them they defy the odds and each in their own way prove pivotal to NASA and their bid to get a man into space....Racial segregation in the US was something that I was aware of and was something that I also had a basic understanding of, however the NASA space race was something I knew little about so on that basis I decided to give this film a shout and I pleased to report that I think I made the right call...Every time I watch a film with racial segregation I feel as though I've been transported into some kind of alternate reality (in that I still find it hard to believe that those times ever existed). Director Theodore Melfi has no quarms in getting this point across and hammers it home at nearly every given opportunity (the heavy-handed approach employed here is my only major criticism that I have with this film).Minor criticisms lie with the imbalanced story arcs with the 3 protagonists; we learn a lot about Katherine (whose brilliant mind and nervous energy make her an interesting and rather fun character to watch), but her friends don't get the same focus which was a bit frustrating to me as I would have liked to have learned more about them. Like a lot of biopics, Melfi plays a lot of the material on the safe side; it's a little fuzzy at times with rather predictable character shifts.However, despite some of the above comments I did enjoy this film ( a special mention goes out to Taraji P Henson who I thought was terrific). The tenacity of these 3 women is beyond question and the breakthroughs in science that they achieved is simply phenomenal. Even with some of its shortcomings, this is an uplifting film about overcoming prejudice, fighting your corner and applying your talents to something that you believe in (regardless of how tough the road ahead may be). I take my hat off to these 3 women and would certainly recommend this film to one and all.",

            "content": "There are times when you see a movie \"based on a true story\", that you roll your eyes and realize that this is a VERY sensationalized account of what happens. \u00a0And then there are times, such as what happened with the new film HIDDEN FIGURES, that all I wanted to do was to go home, find out more about it and wonder \"why didn't I know more about this.\"HIDDEN FIGURES is a very good film about a very interesting part of our recent history that deserves to have more light shed on it.This film tells the tale of the...ahem...HIDDEN FIGURES behind the \"Space Race\" in the 1960's - most intriguingly - the contributions of African-American women.As told by Director Theodore Melfi (the underrated ST. VINCENT - if you haven't seen this, then your'e in for a treat) from a screenplay by Melfi and Allison Schroeder based on the book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly, HIDDEN FIGURES focuses on the efforts of African-American women, embodied by\u00a03 of them\u00a0- Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson - as they navigate racism and sexism to \"just do our jobs\" and help put the Gemini 7 Astronauts in space, and the Apollo Astronauts on the moon.This easily could have been an indictment of how America treated women and minority races in the sixties - but it is much more than that. \u00a0This film shows the heart and courage of strong Americans in the face of adversity and overcoming those adversities with strength and dignity.Much of this strength and dignity can be traced to the 3 actresses in the lead roles - Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae - who incorporate\u00a0these women with nobility, but avoid the trap of making them \"Saints\", they are real women working towards some basic goals in their everyday lives. \u00a0Spencer is nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her work as Vaughan, but I thought Monae's work as Jackson was just as strong, and maybe a little stronger. \u00a0This might be surprising as Monae is fairly new to acting, but if anyone caught her work in the Oscar nominated MOONLIGHT, you can see this performance is no fluke. \u00a0I wonder if her nomination was hindered by votes for her split between those two performances.The real hero of this film, however, is the lead performance given by Henson as Katherine Johnson, \"The Computer\". \u00a0Her portrayal of Johnson showed her as charming and frustrated and strong and impotent and smart and unsure - most of it at the same time. \u00a0Henson has been overlooked for her performance during this awards season, and that is too bad, she is TERRIFIC.Ably assisting these 3 are Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons as 2 co- workers who are \"not sure\" of these ladies and the always dependable Kevin Costner as the boss of all of these people. \u00a0Joining in are Oscar Nominee (for Moonlight) Mahershala Ali and Aldis Hodge as spouses of Johnson and Jackson. \u00a0These two are on too little to make a difference, but you can see something more simmering under there.And that is where this film suffers, a bit. \u00a0It glosses over the racial and sexual tensions of the time to focus on \"a disparate group of people coming together for the common good.\" \u00a0This film ended up pulling it's punches and it would have been interesting to see what would have happened had it not.But, in the end, Director Melfi ends up with a film that can be called \"feel good\" and that is good enough, indeed, to bring these HIDDEN FIGURES into the light.Letter Grade: \u00a0A-/B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (OfMarquis)",

But this didn't happen.Why didn't someone from NASA bring up Katherine Johnson back then to counter this negative publicity? Because her contributions were so insignificant no one with NASA noticed them enough to highlight them. Which is why Hidden Figures matters and must be lavished with awards and praise. It creates a new narrative, completely devoid of truth, about black participation in man's greatest achievement even in the face of discrimination. It's a narrative for a certain audience\u2014it should be noted women made up 64 percent of the opening weekend audience, with minorities representing 57 percent of those seeing the film\u2014want to hear. Yet surely audiences wanted to believe it in 1969 as well. Katherine Johnson, were her contributions so vital, could have been the much-needed minority public relations asset to parade around to the media back then.

The story of black \"computers\" and engineers working in the U.S. space program in the early 1960s is presented here as one such example.The Langley Research Center (near Hampton, Virginia, and not connected to the famous town where the CIA is headquartered) was an early hothouse for NASA research and development, and provided work for men and women of all races in what we now call the STEM fields. To give an idea of how affirmative action developed at NASA, by 1984, only 2 percent of U.S. engineers were black, but 8.4 percent of NASA engineers were black. This movie dramatizes how this shift developed from the beginning of NASA, when talented female and African-American mathematicians got the proverbial foot in the door. (Although, government and government contractor employment of African-Americans and women to do math related tasks went back at least to World War II, and the ups and downs of African-American civil servants can be traced back to the 1870s.)The focus of this movie is on math prodigy Katherine Goble Johnson who becomes indispensable to the Mercury Space Program even while she has to work in a facility that still has segregated restrooms. It takes her a minimum of 40 minutes to take her breaks because the nearest \"colored\" restroom was half a mile away! (Sorry, as dramatic as this story is, it turns out that many of the advancements portrayed in the movie, from the biggest professional achievements of the three main characters to the desegregation of the restrooms, actually occurred by or before 1960.) Nevertheless, this is an excellently told and acted story. As often happens, though, the filmmakers found that they had to pick one of the three characters to focus on more than the others. (Not that the other two women are ignored, they are just not done full justice.) Tariji P. Henson is a star in the best sense. Janelle Mon\u00e1e and the increasingly ubiquitous Octavia Spencer round out the leading roles along with Mahershala Ali as Katherine's devoted husband. Good, if a bit stereotyped(!), in supporting roles are Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons. Glen Powell as John Glenn seems sufficiently Boy Scoutish, but he doesn't look like the thin and prematurely balding Glenn. (Ed Harris, in \"The Right Stuff\", remains a far more convincing Glenn.)Couldn't quite make sense of the way Al Harrison (Costner) went about desegregating the restrooms; if he were going to be seen knocking down a sign, why the \"Colored only\" sign rather than the \"Whites only\" sign? Wasn't the latter the real problem for his star computer?",

Hollywood's approach to the truth is all too possessive and commercial, at least as far as I'm concerned. But this story made me curious so I checked its page on IMDb, and found here the horrible goof of making the Mercury spacecraft too spacious, I went in deeper, and found a very long list of even less significant facts, I was actually expecting to find that the color of the NASA employees shoelaces was all wrong, I really developed a distaste to the goofs section of this site. But I kept on reading, moving into the trivia section of the page where I learned that colors were used to set the mood of the film, using cold neon colors for the NASA spaces and warm colors for the personal office of Al Harrison and the ladies' houses. That really caught me by surprise. Next thing they'll tell me night scenes were set in darkness while daytime scenes used actual daylight. As a rule this section is more illuminating than the goofs section but, by now I was convinced that when IMDb dwells on such details the movie might be truer than most.So here goes: this film does have a truthful feeling to it, the actors and actresses justify the ensemble award they got from SAG, they are all super. The leading three ladies do get more opportunities to shine, especially so Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer, who get most of the screen time, but this is definitely an entire cast working together. Apart from this fact, the movie uses a lean approach that suits movies based on a true story - No fancy CGI or camera angles just plain good old story telling. No fireworks are needed when your basic story works so well. I do agree with the reviewers stating that this is a feelgood movie, it is.

All those Masterpieces are actually great but always find it hard to pitch themselves among wide audience by which I mean greater Box Office draws. Then there are Hidden Figures types of movies which are actually rare which not only gets the praise from critics but are wide celebration among the audience and this is exactly that. From the trailer I have certain expectation of it being inspiring filled with some funny and some serious scenes and it had all that but it also had that charm which resonates it with the audience. The only other movies coming this closer in last year were Zootopia and Arrival. No Wonder it is one of the only 60 films to get A+ Cinemascore rating.Based on a true story it truly showcase the hardships of women of color to work with NASA despite them truly talented. Many films have showcased the them but this one showcased the spirit of these women who won't be let down in any circumstances and thus went on to make history. Apart from Great Performances , it's the characters of this films that keeps it together.Script , Direction all are on board. No Wonder it will grab much attention during this award season. It's a feel good movie that you can watch again and again. There are many types of movies like this that states at the end that this man/women went on to this and that. But this one is rare having a charm due to its lead. Last I watched this much engaging Biography was 2014's The Imitation Game. To state simply it's a Masterpiece but it refuses to be one just so that we can enjoy it to the fullest instead of going to the technical details of script, direction and performances. And that makes it the most Entertaining Entry of this Award Season after of course La La Land which we all know... Also I am fan of Taraji and Spencer so they are great but the surprising one here is Janelle Monae . Seriously She is the Show Stealer .............",

A jarring anachronism. Another thing: I grew up in the South the same time this story happened. Things were not NEARLY as shiny and clean as presented in this film. And folks weren't as nice, either.

            "content": "I'm sure many of you didn't know who Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan or Mary Jackson were before watching this. And now that you have watched it, you've come out fully informed right? Thus, this historically significant event during the space race of the 60s has done its job, with excellence might I add. The three coloured women mentioned above were all working for NASA in different departments. Using their intellect and self-determination, they must overcome the obstacles of Virginia's enforced segregation policy in order to achieve their maximum potential in their careers. Immediately I was drawn in by the chemistry of our three leading ladies. Henson, Spencer and Mon\u00e1e did not succumb to the typical role of playing a minority. No no, they embraced the chance to showcase the power, confidence and, most importantly, sass that coloured women took pride in. It's about standing up to the conformities of 60s America, not just laying down on your back because a white man told you to! It gives me great pleasure to see films like this that present equality and the requirement of teamwork regardless of gender, race etc. still being produced today. The narrative beautifully blends the intellectual assignments of NASA with petty racial segregating amenities. One coloured women's bathroom? A kettle just for coloured folk? It's outrageous that disgusting actions like those actually happened. This is why we need films like this, to ensure we never regress to such a primal state of mind in society. For that, this film succeeds. Always brought a smug smile to my face when any of these characters show off and solve a fiendishly difficult calculation that the other employees could not answer. The script allows these characters to be developed by portraying their personal lives as well. It is a bloated subject where certain areas are underdeveloped like the family lives and the new flourishing romance. However, an important and well crafted film.",

Other pluses from this film include the music and the cinematography.There does seem to be a load of artistic license used, even for some important scenes, which is a little disappointing as it would've been nice to have a more truthful telling of this era in world history.

I don't know enough about the specific history of NASA to comment on that point, but the exposition was integrated well. They are all African American women, and they face all the bigotries that one would expect in the mostly intolerant environment of Virginia in the 1960s. They all start as \"computers\" to perform mathematics manually but soon move into roles ranging from computing orbital mechanics to programming their technological replacements. Hidden Figures tries to do a lot, and it does much of it well. It is, at times, a touching movie that pulls on the heart-strings. Yet despite its grand ambitions, I do not think that it is a great movie. Its message, while noble, is made ham-fistedly. Jim Parsons as villain was a nice touch, and the three main actors did a marvelous job. Taraji Henson did a particularly striking job. However, the film's ambitions of covering three different character arcs perhaps weakened its execution of all of them. John Glenn's character in particular seems more like 21st century wish-fulfillment than a realistic take on a character, and the physical smashing of the segregated bathroom signs was also a bit too obvious a metaphor.It is not a bad movie, and it is certainly an uplifting one, if not exactly a great one.",

So these black women not only had to fight because they were women but because they were black too. And it is an interesting story because they are really smart women working at the NASA, something that didn't happen every day. So besides the fight of these women to prove what they were capable of, there is also the final destination, which is something that hadn't been done before. So we are taught a bit of history too.All three main actresses do an amazing job portraying these strong women. I specially like Taraji P. Henson who already got our attention in the show Empire. the main characters are supported by a bunch of well-known actors playing the secondary ones, which only supports more the work of the three leading ladies.An interesting movie to learn more about the people that we don't see in the news, about their hard work that make civilization moving forward, about what happens when you are different and don't have the same rights as the others just because of the color of your skin.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is the inspiring true story of the under-appreciated and undervalued heroes of the space race's formative years. Specifically, the film recalls the various trials and tribulations of mathematician Dorothy Vaughan, engineer Mary Jackson and physicist Katherine G. Johnson all of whom were women, black and working on the Mercury missions. When the film begins they're all working among a pool of colored women whom Johnson once sarcastically dubbed \"computers in skirts.\" Their job was to calculate launch and landing, which according to history was a task all the women of the West Area Computing Unit took on with vigor. As time neared the first American space flights, Johnson gained the support of her colleagues and helped plot navigational charts and develop launch windows for the likes of Alan Shepard, Virgil Grissom and John Glenn.The accounts of these three women before, during and after Mercury are intrinsically interesting enough to fill up an entire series of movies or at the very least get the three-plus hour Right Stuff (1983) treatment. A cursory look at their lives reveals a parade of stunning accomplishments, a slew of firsts and a treasure trove of women-in-STEM stories that yearn to be told to every young girl with a chemistry set.Sadly for Johnson (Henson), Vaughan (Spencer) and Jackson (Monae), Hidden Figures is comparatively light, rerouting all its energy from the soul, work and math to being just another clich\u00e9-ridden crowd-pleaser. Instead of the stories we need told, the script populates the screen with watered-down cliffnotes and gambles on the cast to give the film's bullet points just enough of a unique flavor. The institutional racism spread throughout sends powerful messages (as often happens in these kinds of movies) but far too many times we get the feeling we're being setup for a cathartic change in the wind instead of feeling the full impact of the institutional racism.Nor do we face hard truths of its effects. Each of our heroes responds to their plight in different ways. Vaughan uses every resource to make her indispensable, going so far as to learn programming to get leverage over her boss (Dunst). Her tact in getting what she wants is certainly the most enlightened \u2013 she learns how to program then she teaches those in her office. Yet her leadership through service always stops at the water's edge. \"You don't ask for equal rights, you demand it, you take it,\" says Jackson's husband (Hodge) right before he's put in his place. Then as if to prove something, Jackson breaks barriers to become an engineer by asking really, really nicely.Johnson jumps over the pratfalls of institutional racism by simply being smarter than everyone; a distinction Taraji P. Henson wears with quiet dignity until she suddenly doesn't for a brief rain soaked scene that screams Oscar-bait. Because Johnson is so likable a lot is forgiven but at some point I really had to ask myself how many times they were going to compliment her scenes of empowerment with Kevin Costner on autopilot.That in conjunction with the treacly family and romance scenes involving Mahershala Ali sink this film from being anything more than a feel-good, run-of-the-mill, \"boy that racism, so glad that's over\" movie. I kid you not, watching this film in a crowded theater and hearing audiences react to every payoff was like witnessing a Pavlovian experiment on complacency in real time. At least Hidden Figures isn't as bad as The Help (2011). It's more like Remember the Titans (2000) for nerds.",

Katherine Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson), Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e), and Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) were powerful role models for their, or any, age. Despite being relegated to the pool of \"colored computers,\" as the black female mathematicians were called, and despite their superb skills being barely recognized, they showed astonishing levels of patience and tenacity, as the story tells it. At times, the movie feels like a deserved exercise in myth-making. Families are supportive, kids are perfect, home life is smooth. These women are almost too good. Their lives had to be more complicated than that. But those aspects of their stories are secondary to their achievements in the workplace, and that's where the movie focuses. With the recent passing of John Glenn (reportedly every bit as open and truly nice as on screen here), the early days of U.S. space program have disappeared into history. Today's Americans either weren't born yet or may have forgotten the fear that gripped the nation when Russia orbited the first satellite, when rocket after rocket blew up on the Cape Kennedy launch pad. When our education system, at least temporarily, geared up for greater student achievement in math and science. The pressure on NASA to succeed was enormous, and this is the environment in which these women worked and excelled. Despite their significant contributions five decades ago, something essential about the message has been lost. Between 1973 and 2012, 22,172 white men received PhDs in physics, as did only 66 black women. I liked this movie; I think the subject is great, and the broader recognition well deserved and too long delayed. The three women play their roles beautifully, as individuals, not symbols. While the subject was new and surprising, the film stakes no new emotional territory. More disappointing, fifty years on, the movie's \"feel-good\" moment is quickly trumped by awareness of our society's persistent racism and gender inequity. Perhaps the fact that this movie has been a top box office draw several weeks running, will help, but I've seen that movie before. See it for yourself, feel good, and then ask yourself, what next?",

Stupid - There are a few scenes that kinda bugged me, but I'm just going to mention 2. In one scene someone at NASA misjudged the size of a door and they had to knock in the wall with a sledgehammer to move some equipment. It was played as a joke, but it wasn't that funny and it annoyed me that they were so uncoordinated and they just wrecked the wall. Second, there is a scene later in the movie where a guy is knocking down the sign for the \"colored bathroom\" with a crowbar and wrecks the wall. There is a massive gash in the wall after it finally falls. What the dude should've done is carefully remove the sign (which would've been faster) and then took the sign outside to burn it or something. Wrecking walls may seem convenient in the short time, but what about when you have to go hire someone to fix the wall? Doesn't seem so convenient now does it?Sights and Sounds - The cinematography for this movie is fantastic. The sound mixing isn't terrible, but it could've been better.",

Basically in 1961, African-American mathematician Katherine Goble (Empire's Taraji P. Henson) works for NASA, at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, as a \"computer\" in the segregated West Area Computers division, alongside her fellow African-American colleagues, aspiring engineer Mary Jackson (Moonlight's Janelle Mon\u00e1e) and unofficial supervisor Dorothy Vaughan (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Octavia Spencer). The Russians have successfully launched a space satellite, pressure is increasing for American astronauts to be sent into space, white supervisor Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) assigns Katherine to assist the Space Task Group of Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), she is the first \"coloured\" woman in the team and in the building, with no bathrooms for coloured people. Katherine's new colleagues, especially head engineer Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons), are initially dismissive and demeaning, meanwhile Dorothy is rejected by Mrs Mitchell to be officially promoted to supervisor, and Mary pursues an engineering degree after discovering a flaw in the experimental space capsule's heat shields. Katherine meets National Guard officer Jim Johnson (Moonlight's Mahershala Ali) at a barbecue, they are attracted to each other, she is disappointed when he is sceptical about women's mathematical abilities, for this he apologises, and they are ultimately married. Harrison invites his subordinates to solve a complex mathematical equation, he is impressed when Katherine steps forward, the Mercury 7 astronauts, including astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell), visit Langley, Glenn is courteous and gracious to the West Area Computers. Over time, Katherine becomes better acquainted with her colleagues, Harrison abolishes the bathroom segregation after Katherine explains how far she has to walk for a coloured bathroom, and Stafford, after initial objections, allows her to be included in meetings. Katherine creates an elaborate equation to guide the space capsule into a safe re-entry, but is forced to remove her name from all reports, they are solely credited to Stafford, meanwhile Mary goes to court for permission to attend night classes in an all-white school to obtain her engineering degree, the judge is convinced. Dorothy learns her co-workers could be replaced by the impending installation of an IBM 7090 electronic computer, she visits the room and successfully starts the machine, but she is scolded from a library, trying to borrow a book about FORTRAN (Formula Translation) from the whites-only section, Mrs Mitchell congratulates Dorothy on her work, but is unconvinced with her assurance that she treated her no differently because of her skin colour. After learning FORTRAN and training her West Area co- workers, Dorothy is officially promoted to supervise the Programming Department, the others are also transferred, Mrs Mitchell shows her new-found respect calling her by her surname. The final arrangements for John Glenn's launch are made, but Katherine is informed she is no longer needed at Space Task Group, she is being reassigned back to West Area Computers, her colleagues bid farewell giving her a pearl necklace, the only jewellery permitted with dress code. However, prior to the launch, discrepancies arise in the IBM 7090 calculations for the capsule's landing coordinates, Glenn requests Katherine be called in to check them, she hurriedly delivers the results to the control room, but the door is slammed in her face, but Harrison brings her in so she can relay the results. The launch is successful, but the space capsule has a warning light indicating a heat shield problem, Katherine suggests leaving the retro-rocket attached for reentry, this proves to be correct and Friendship 7 successfully lands in the ocean. Following the mission, the mathematicians are laid off and ultimately replaced by electronic computers, Katherine is reassigned to the Analysis and Computation Division, Dorothy continues to supervise the Programming Department, and Mary obtains her engineering degree. The epilogue tells that Katherine calculated the trajectories for the Apollo 11 and Apollo 13 missions, in 2015 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a Computational Research Facility at the Langley Research Center was named in her honour. Also starring Aldis Hodge as Levi Jackson, Kimberly Quinn as Ruth and Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa as Karl Zielinski. Henson has the brains, Spencer has the determination and Mon\u00e1e has the eagerness, each of the three give great performances, as do Costner and Dunst in supporting roles. It is a fascinating story that deserves to be told, one that almost nobody but NASA would have known about until now, it is unbelievable how severe segregation was in those days, even just separating water or coffee for black people, it is disgusting, but this in a way adds to how compelling the story is, how perceptions through knowledge and fact can change, there is room for some humour as well, it is an enlightening unsung heroes tale, a most interesting biographical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Adapted Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Hans Zimmer, Pharrell Williams and Benjamin Wallfisch. Very good!",

            "content": "\"Based on a true story\". When I see that line at the beginning of a movie I'm already getting excited. It just gives the movie a little bit more punch when you know it's based on real life events. And here it's about segregation in the sixties or how the majority of the white Americans were racists, or at least acted like it was normal for a colored human being to not have the same rights as anyone else. A real disgrace, and if you think about it it's not even that long ago. I would have hated living in that era. Human beings can be such disgusting parasites. But Hidden Figures isn't all about hatred towards other colored human beings, it's mostly an homage to those who helped writing history without getting credit for it, except when they were of old age. A secret well kept, because an Afro-American couldn't be smarter than a Caucasian in that era. So it's not all bad in the movie, you also get a couple of feelgood moments. Moments when I surprised myself cheering loudly for the oppressed. The cast is phenomenal. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Kevin Costner are just sublime in their roles. The only one I didn't like was Jim Parsons. To me he will always be the irritating nerd from the highly overrated show The Big Bang Theory. It's just one of those actors I can't stand. I don't know why, it's just like that. But for the rest Hidden Figures is a must watch movie. A movie that tells a story about segregation, women rights and Nasa history. One of the better ones I saw this year.",

Certain films would have sub-characters warm to the free come the final act, but this shows restraint in doing this, something that makes the film all the more powerful.As usual, Costner is amazing in his role, and the 'interrigation' scene is funny, moving, and damning to the doubters.The scenes involving him and Henson, are wonderfully touching, but never involving that warmth you would expect from a film like this, thus making it feel all the more real. His main focus is the job in hand, and scenes like him smashing down the bathroom is to help him get the job done, after all, it takes Henson around forty minutes to use the facilities.The message is positive, the performances are amazing, particularly Spencer and Costner, and hopefully this film will draw attention to Costner and Spencer's wonderful film 'Black and White'",

            "content": "My first thoughts after seeing the trailer to Hidden Figures was to question its watchabliity. My second thought was that Hidden Figures may be just the opposite. It had a story that as the title describes is relatively unknown and deals with one of the most exciting times in history. On top of that is a great solution to a Hollywood problem, the lack of leading roles for women, especially ones of color. Hidden Figures provides 3 leading roles for women of color, but unfortunately focuses far too much on that aspect of the characters, and not enough on their actual accomplishments. Oh and that watchability thing, well that's a problem too.The real truth is that the story underneath it all is pretty lackluster. These women were certainly achieved some great things in a world that wanted them to do the opposite, but movies do have to be entertaining. The plot is not driven by these women and them overcoming both racism and sexism, but by the space race and the countless amounts of white men who benefited from it. The amount of scenes showing the women being treated like trash almost double the ones that show them succeeding. Race and sexism should certainly be part of this story, but it took over most of the movie which is disappointing.The best thing about Hidden Figures are the three leads. Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughan and she fits into the supporting role perfectly. I don't want to call her a motherly figure, but she takes control a few times on the movie and it's great to see Ms. Spencer getting awards looks again. Janelle Mon\u00e1e plays Mary Jackson and has the difficult task of acting alongside two fantastic actresses. She brings a lot of character to Jackson, but feels flat compared to her co stars. The real jewel here is the performance of Taraji P. Henson as Katherine G. Johnson. Henson lights up the screen, and even though she is normally known as a bit of an over the top actress she brings subtlety to the role. She gets her moments to go all out and boy does she use them, another possible awards candidate and Ms. Henson's finest performance yet.Hidden Figures will probably have a few Oscar noms by the time all is said and done, and while it is more deserving than movies like Hacksaw Ridge and Birth of a Nation, it does not deserve to be in the same category as Moonlight and La La Land. While watching Hidden Figures I was reminded of Loving, not because racial tensions drive both movies, but because they both have the same nagging issue, they are stories that are just not fit for movies. I would much rather watch a documentary on either the story of the Lovings or the women featured in Hidden Figures. At least I would gain some historical knowledge rather than being made to feel bad because people with the same color skin as me were assholes 60 years ago. Hidden Figures is not a bad movie, it just wants to be something its not, and that is never a good way to make a movie.",

            "content": "\"Hidden Figures\" tells the story of three courageous African-American women who were pioneers in their respective fields in the early years of NASA. The screenplay was outstanding, and the performances were uniformly excellent.The film juggles the lives of three remarkable women. Dorothy Vaughn became the first African-American female supervisor at NASA in her work in computer programming. Mary Jackson fought the legal system in Virginia in order to register for night classes in order to improve her chances to become and engineer. And the film's primary focus is on Catherine G. Johnson, a brilliant student of mathematics, who was instrumental in calculating the data for the earliest American space launches.The biggest historical drama depicted by the film is the launch of the Friendship 7 mission, described as one of the turning points in the space race with Colonel John Glenn returned safely to earth. Katherine Johnson worked behind the scenes, crossing the color barrier in one of the great intellects at NASA. At one point in the film, Johnson thinks outside of the box when she goes to the ancient calculations of Euler's Method, stunning her colleagues with a set of accurate numerical results. The hidden figures of mathematics emerge in the film, just as the three women come into their own as hidden figures in the early period of civil rights.The film balances the space saga with the challenges of the three women faced in the era of Jim Crow. Much time is devoted to the daily humiliation of segregated restrooms, drinking fountains, and even coffee pots within the NASA organization. Kevin Costner is good as the crusty project manager, who recognizes the genius of Katherine Jackson. Kirsten Dunst plays the callous supervisor of the women, who finally comes round to supporting the promotion of Dorothy Vaughn.The period style of the early 1960s was faithfully created by the filmmakers. Documentary footage of the early NASA missions helped to bring the hidden figures out of the background and place them in an era of ferment of change in American history.",

A reminder of the racial prejudices that existed in the US only 50 years ago, many of which was statute- enshrined. The movie shows how these prejudices are broken down when people realise that race has no impact on ability. Not overly original in its themes, but well told, and told in an original setting.

            "content": "A must-watch. In the backdrop of 1960s USA when the country was trying to catch up with the Soviets in space, Hidden Figures brings to light the stories of three black women who make their mark in a white-male dominated NASA. Story (9/10): Hidden Figures talks about the struggles of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson to make their mark in the world's most respected space organization. As US battles USSR in the race to send the first human in space, there is an internal battle that NASA witnesses against racism+sexism. While the rest of the country is obviously divided between whites and colored, surprisingly, a very scientific organization like NASA is also not very different with colored toilets, colored coffee mugs, and colored buildings - just like in general public life where pretty much everything under the sun had a segregation. It is this discrimination that is stopping the US from achieving the full potential of their human talent - leaving untapped the geniuses in the black community. However, sense prevails eventually as these three ladies stubbornly place their foot through the doors of critical operations in NASA and through persistence, make their way through the white+male dominated work environment. They face their own share of struggles but they never give up and place their work above their egos, which sets them apart from the rest of the crowd. Diving into their personal lives where they interact with other fellow blacks, the conversations conveyed the difference in their perspective and approach towards fighting the segregated society very well. The good part about the story is that they have focused more on building positive characters than negative, which makes it a very \"feel good\" movie as you watch it. However, the best message of the story is that you can only fight oppression by hard work, smart thinking, and persistence - not violence and hatred. Acting (9/10): Taraji Henson (playing Katherine), Octavia Spencer (playing Dorothy) and Janelle Monae (playing Mary) are brilliant in their roles. What I loved was the different shades given to the character of each lady, which may or may not be true in their real life. While Katherine is sincere and hard working, Dorothy is mature and very smart and Mary is playful but passionate about her work. These are the kind of roles that gets sketches into the minds for a very long time and these three ladies scored a perfect home run here. Jim Parsons was distinctively noticeable due to his BBT legacy and did well on a larger screen. The role was pretty much in his comfort zone. However, if the director imagined him in a negative shade in the movie, that didn't come out well. The rest of the supporting cast was good with their limited screen time. Direction (10/10): Theodore Melfi's direction of the movie is great. From Scene 1 itself, he made it clear that this is not going to be a soap opera of oppression but a \"feel good\" story of how intelligence prevails over emotions. The character sketch of the three protagonists was very well thought and it brought the much-needed variety in the story. The brilliant execution of the story ensured that audience attention wasn't lost even for a moment. The mild humor on right occasions added good flavor to the overall movie. On the serious side, the depiction of Dorothy, Mary and Katherine's struggles against racial and gender discrimination is done beautifully. Theodore very intelligently used the part of the protagonists' personal lives to convey from where their strengths come and communicate their perspective to life. Overall (9/10): Overall, the movie is very well made and must watch. If you grew up in that era, it will be like reliving the old days. If you weren't, you would get a glimpse of life in those days of segregation.",

            "content": "The movie is based on a book, but both were released in about the same time, so who can know for sure. It is the story of three very smart African-American women who got ahead at NASA, despite habitual and wide spread racism. It's not about the Moon shot, but the period right before, when Russians were still beating Americans in space and they were all frustrated about it, so the working conditions were tough.The actors played very well and the story is based on real people at NASA. I doubt that they could have gotten away with too much dramatization when real people are involved, right? Yet considering the only of the three women who is still alive is 98 and that they went with the ole Oscar bait formula, I have my doubts. You know, take well known but faded actors and make them do character play, use foreshadowing for the most impactful moments in the movie, link the storyline not only to the American dream (both in space and in terms of getting out from under racism), but also with short jabs at \"the American soul\" and short references to Jews in Nazi Germany (but not on using Wernher von Braun for their rockets, of course).It was a good movie, but the feel of it was off. It felt like the black women in this film had a modern mentality and reactions, rather than what I imagine would have been the negro state of mind in a country where toilets and bus seats were separated by color. But I haven't lived there and then and I may be wrong. Also the knight in shining armor that was played by Kevin Costner was so over the top that it just felt fake. Poor Jim Parsons was stuck playing a nasty racist bureaucrat, Kirsten Dunst was the nice but conservative lady... it was just too cardboard.Bottom line: with less agenda and more science and inspiration it could have been great.",

The movie is not just dramatic, it's moving in parts too, and I have to say that more than once, I was ashamed to be white. The very idea of segregation was and is shameful and I felt deeply for them on more than one occasion. The story, without giving too much away, centers on three women, who happen to be black, at a period in history when the small-minded considered black people to be pariahs and inferior; this movie shows there is and was nothing inferior about these brilliant women. They push through the bigotry and make their way into the upper-echelons of NASA. Katherine Goble was nothing less than a genius and without her brilliant mind, man would probably never have made it to the moon when he did. Certainly John Glenn would never have left the launch-pad when he orbited the earth, without her correcting IBM computer coordinates. It's a wonderful movie and I'd recommend it to anyone.

            "content": "Real-life events have often proved to be fertile ground for filmmakers. Even when events are apparently well documented, such as NASA and the American space program, they have made for fine pieces of film- making as they can sometimes find the little known stories and illuminate them. Hidden Figures is a prime example of this as it takes viewers back to the early 1960s as America pushed headlong into the Space Race and the role that a group of female African- American mathematicians, effectively tasked as human computers, played in that effort.In telling this story, the film brings together a strong cast. Octavia Spencer, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, and Taraji P. Henson play the three leads of the film who find themselves facing different tasks and circumstances as they work at NASA's Langley Research Center. Of the three it is Henson who perhaps gets the largest role of the three as Katherine Johnson, whose work becomes crucial to the success of early Mercury missions. Mon\u00e1e's performance is solid as well, playing a woman struggling not just with the racial elements of the time but also institutionalized sexism as well. Yet out of the trio the best performance might come from Spencer who is an effective scene stealer throughout and does not surprise me in the least that she has received an Oscar nomination. Together, these three women (both as characters and as actresses) anchor the film solidly.The supporting cast is solid but nowhere near as strong. Out of them, it is perhaps Kevin Costner as Space Task Group head Al Harrison (a character inspired by the real life Robert Gilruth) who stands out the best as an authoritative but sympathetic boss. Many of the performances though ranging from Jim Parsons' NASA engineer, Kirsten Dunst as the trio's immediate supervisor, Glen Powell as John Glenn , and Mahershala Ali as Jim Johnson all suffer not so much from their actual performances but from often feeling like little more than cardboard cut-outs filling out the film. Which is a shame in a way as some of them feel either superfluous or wasted in their roles with some such as Powell (who is way too young to be playing the forty year old astronaut) perhaps being mis-cast. For what they have to work with though, they do good work.Outside of its leading trio, the film has strong production values. The film does an excellent job of taking the viewer back to the early part of the 1960s, a time of both optimism and yet still rooted firmly in the past. This is something the filmmakers work to their advantage with the costumes and sets especially feeling straight out of the period. The film makes strong use of archival footage over CGI effects to bring the actual missions to life though the mixture of the two together is well done so that it takes being familiar with the actual footage to spot the difference. The music score, despite coming from three quite different composers, suits the film well ranging from simple but highly effective orchestral pieces from Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch to songs by Pharrell Williams. Combined with the direction of Theodore Melfi, the film becomes a strong mix of elements that take the viewer into the period while also telling an engaging story.None of which would be possible without the script. Melfi and co- writer Allison Schroeder are to be commended on taking a tale that takes in the early history of NASA, the math of space flight, the burgeoning Civil Rights movement, plus life in the 1960s south to create a script that not only is informative but engaging as well. They do so by injecting a good deal of humor into the film and I have to admit to being surprised by the amount of times I laughed over the course of the two hour running time but also tension. It says something that I heard sharp intakes of breath during the climatic sequence involving Glenn's mission as the film manages to make a tense sequence despite the audience presumably knowing that the astronaut lived into old age before passing away recently. Yet the script, and the film itself truth be told, does tend to delve into unsubtle melodrama that undermines it at times. There are scenes that, even sitting in the cinema, feel entirely invented such as confrontation involving Katherine Johnson and her white colleagues and a scene that immediately follows it. The film is also guilty of some historical and technical errors as well from a newscaster's line of dialogue about the Mercury capsule \"achieving an altitude of 116 miles per hour\" to the lack of figures such as NASA rocket engineer Wernher Von Braun or condensing NASA's facilities down to the point that less knowledgeable viewers might think that Mercury mission control was in Virginia (it was really down in Florida). It is something that perhaps undermines the film somewhat though not to a fatal extent.On the whole though, I can forgive the writers and the film for its occasional lack of subtlety and over-simplifications. Hidden Figures tells a little known story into a highly engaging way thanks to a combination of strong lead characters, first rate production values, and a script that takes what could have been a heady combination of historical events and infusing it with humor and tension. It is a fine example of what a historical drama can do: illuminate the past for a new generation and inspiring them.",

Hidden Figures is the story of three African American women who fought both battles.Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) work for NASA and are part of a group of mathematical geniuses referred to as human computers since mechanical computers weren't invented yet to perform such difficult calculations. The Russians launched the first ever satellite into space followed by the first man to orbit the earth and Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) is pressured to surpass the Soviet efforts. They don't want to be outdone in the space race, they need to justify a space program that has yet to send a man to space, and they fear the Russians' access to space will allow them to spy on the United States. Desperate to succeed, Katherine is sent to the think tank of all white male human computers. She struggles to fit in and be accepted and respected, but she is determined, eventually winning them over. On the day of the launch of John Glenn aboard the Mercury Friendship 7, the IBM super computer calculations do not match the ones the human computers had figured out and Katherine is called in to confirm the correct numbers. The information must be relayed to Glenn, but her findings are given to Al and she is shut out. Al opens the door and invites her to come witness the achievement she helped to orchestrate. Katherine was also instrumental in the Apollo 11 flight to the moon in 1969. It wasn't until 2015 that she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and until 2016 that NASA renamed the Langley Research Center in Virginia the Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility. Hidden Figures is an amazing story that took entirely too long to come to light. The biggest thing the trio of African American human computer women had going for them in 1961 was that America hated the Soviets just a bit more than they held to their racism and sexism. If Katherine could find a way to beat the Russians, their biases against her skin color and gender were overlooked to defeat the enemy. The preview showed what could be an Oscar nomination worthy performance from Taraji P. Henson in the biggest role of her long career. She has mostly done television work and voice overs with some supporting character roles along the way. Most recently, she has starred in the TV series Empire after she left the hit drama Person of Interest. She was quite comfortable in her role as the leading lady playing the timid and demure mother of 3 trying not to rock the boat at work but also the strong woman who knew when and how to speak up when necessary. Surprisingly, Henson was not nominated for her role, but Octavia Spencer was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and honestly, I feel they got those reversed. While the racial tensions were heated in the United States, the preview showed clips that glossed over the severity of the fight for equality with walls of segregation falling around them both in and out of NASA. There was a lot of humor in the preview and my only concern was how the 2 hour and 7 minute movie would deal with the graphic nature of our countries ugly history at this time. I'm gave Hidden Figures a 3.5 Star Prediction. I am sticking with that 3.5 Star rating. I thought it was missing something and I can't quite put my finger on it. I didn't want the racial issues to be jammed down my throat, but I felt the true weight of the tension of the time wasn't adequately portrayed. We saw clips of segregated buses and schools, white and colored drinking fountains, a special colored only coffee pot for Katherine, but it still didn't quite feel as uncomfortable to a viewer as it should have. I know the main point of the movie was about their accomplishments at NASA during this particular time, but I still think they could have addressed the racial and sexist issues in such a way that it really upset an audience member, thus further emphasizing just how incredible their accomplishments were. Still, I thought it was worth the money to see it in the theatres, I'll probably watch it again, but probably won't be owning this one. marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",

IN BRIEF: A trio of fine performances empower an uplifting tale of tolerance and strength.GRADE: B+SYNOPSIS: Three African-American women overcome prejudice and use their talents working at NASA during the early 60's.JIM'S REVIEW: Hidden Figures, a docudrama solidly directed by Theodore Melfi, tells the true story of three African-American women whose talents with numbers brought them together to work on the space program at NASA. Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) became the brains behind one of America's greatest achievements in history: the successful orbit of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell). Dealing with Jim Crow laws and discrimination due to their race and gender, these pioneers contributed to the Civil Rights movement. The film tells their untold story with much understated power. There are some intriguing unknown facts at play in the literate screenplay by the director and Allison Schroeder (humans called computers / outdated technology like the massive IBM machines / segregated book sections in public libraries, many African-American secretaries working at NASA, etc.) The script shows the racial inequities in the subtlest of ways.\ufffcStill, there is a bit of whitewashing over the more brutal aspects that occurred during the early 1960's era against the \"colored\" race. None of the violence is shown in gut-wrenching honesty. It's all a little too sanitized. and the lead characters come off a tad saintly. There also seems to be a large degree of fictitious composites with some of the supporting characters in order to create dramatic conflict for our trio of crusaders. These bigoted \"white folk\" come off more plot devices than as actual people. However, the story itself is always involving and handled extremely well. The end result may be more crowd-pleasing than realistic, but as entertainment goes, historical accuracy is second place to real enjoyment.The lead actresses are superb. Ms. Henson, Ms. Spencer, and a beguiling Ms. Mon\u00e1e create vivid characters and their chemistry is electric. One immediately roots for their inevitable success throughout the film. Kevin Costner, Jim Parsons, Kirsten Dunst, and Mahershala Ali co- star, and they all bring great nuance to their stock characters.Mr. Melfi re-creates the turbulent times with a restrained vision. He never overdoes the injustice angle, although a little more anger may have more impact for this reviewer. That said, Hidden Figures is a film that finally recognizes the talents and determination of these African-American women who overcame obstacles in their everyday lives. The film deserves your attention. This is one of the most important feel-good movies of the year, with more uplift in their stories than the customary lift-off of a NASA launch itself. Go see it.NOTE: The film score by Hans Zimmer, Pharrell Williams, and Benjamin Wallfisch added a nice R & B flavored vibe to the film. Especially strong was the theme use of the song Runnin' and closing credit song, Mirage, with Mary J. Bilge's powerful vocals. Very impressive.",

It's held down by that innate darkness, but it's a film about overcoming those odds and difficulties in order to prove your self-worth. There are a couple moments where it does feel like it's hammering in its messages too hard, but for the most part, Hidden Figures allows the reality of what it's telling to send its own message, rather than forcing a message down the audience's throat. And that absolutely works best for this movie. Director Theodore Melfi does a great job making this film, and balancing all those different elements of the story. It works to elevate characters, while at the same time understanding the bigger picture of not just what these events meant for African Americans and the Glass Ceiling, but also for space research and exploration. It's an incredibly balanced film at Melfi's hands...",

Henson) up from Langley to help solve it.Unfortunately, the segregation and sexism of the Sixties keeps her from fitting in with her white, middle-aged male contemporaries.Meanwhile, Katherine's equally brilliant friends (Octavia Spencer, Janelle Mon\u00e1e) experience their own discrimination at the hands of their bigoted superior (Kirsten Dunst).A well-acted and aptly written account of the unpublicized contributions that African- American women made to the space race, this biography is inspiring on a number of fronts, specifically the social inequalities that continue to plague society.Incidentally, NASA also made the first black astronaut sit in the back of the shuttle.

Nasa was at a fast pace to get a space shuttle launched. One thing I felt like it was unheard, was the person that made this possible, mathematician Katherine (Taraji P. Henson). Gifted at an early age in elementary school and ahead of everyone in her class. The teachers recommended scholarships and plans for college. Many years later, Katherine, engineer Mary (Janelle Monae) and Mathematician and supervisor Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) all work together in a subdivision for computers in Langley. After the Russians launched their first satellite into space. The pressure for the Americans was high, when Nasa was in a hurry to get their first astronaut into space. Al (Kevin Cosnter) director on trying to get an space craft engineered, asks for Katherine to join his group on trying to solve these algorithm equations. Unwelcomed by many of his staff since she was an African American. Katherine faces the challenges of trying to solve a difficult equation and being mistreated by her coworkers. She is not allowed to get a cup of coffee from the same coffee pot or use the same bathroom. Making her run out of the building and to the colored bathroom in a different division building. Hidden Figures is a crowd pleasing drama film that shows the hardship these characters went through. Like a moment when Dorothy was not allowed to check out a book with her son in a library and has to go to the color section. Moments like seeing her son, wondering why they are treated that way. While her mother responds about only doing the right thing, and not letting anyone take an advantage. As she discusses about taking a book without permission from the library but she replies that she paid her taxes, so she has her rights like anyone else does. The film does convey a great story on what was going on behind the scenes with the space launch and showing the mathematician perspective on making this happen. Taraji P. Henson gave a great performance and will have to say is one of her better films. Octavia Spencer did great. Janelle Monae was also good, about how she is inspired to be an engineer. Kevin Costner was also good. The rest of the cast ensemble was great with their brief small roles. The one thing we can all predict from this, is we know what the outcome is. That's usually what falls with most based on true events biographical stories. I felt like the film dragged on at parts and could have been trimmed like 15 mins. Cause there were moments, were it did get kind of boring. Also, felt like the music score could have been more inspirational with the direction. Which is sad, cause music composer Hans Zimmer is brilliant in his other work. But being partnered with Benjamin Wallfisch, there score in the film did not add to the movie. On the bonus side, Pharrell Williams did have an okay song adapted for the movie. Overall, Hidden Figures is a fairly well drama film, I do recommend that you should watch. Just to see these characters that went through a lot, facing against racism and sexism. All while trying to work for Nasa and making the space launch successful. Plus the cast ensemble performances were all great.",

Taraji plays a math prodigy. Ever since she was a little girl she was good with numbers-she graduated high school at 14 & college at 18. She gets a job with her friend, Octavia, at the Virginia branch of NASA, but because of the times and the color of her skin and being a female-a triple wammy-they were segregated from the other workers. Kevin runs the division that calculates the math on space launches and sees Taraji's skills in action and puts her to work. Of course, others are not as enlightened as Kevin and are working under long held prejudices. Jim and Kirsten play sub bosses-next in line, down from Kevin-with Jim over Taraji and Kirsten over Octavia. This was all before computers so they used lots of blackboards, pens and papers to do their calculations. At the end of the movie, they show the real people the movie is based on and tell you what they accomplished.

            "content": "In \"Hidden Figures\" we have a case of a book only just predating the film thereof (both are from 2016). Bearing in mind the huge story here, this can come as no real surprise ... unlike the \"dynamite\" content - entirely unknown to just about all of us, I suspect, devotees of NASA missions as we may have been. Author Margot Lee Shetterly is a \"child of NASA\" (born 1969), as her dad worked there, while her mother lectured at Hampton, and so she is steeped in the tradition and has her point to make. It needs making (just as the similar point in \"The Butler\" from 2013 needed making).And so to Theodore Melfi's film, in which the abiding image is of some of the 1961 rooms at Langley, Virginia, being full of almost clone-like white guys in white shirts and ties and badges (the kind I dreamed of being when growing up); while others are full of colourfully-attired women whose skin is black. Like everything else in the then Virginia, this is segregated, and these visuals achieve much before we even get to the dialogue and plot.Some movement between the two sets of rooms (separated by hundreds of yards) is now beginning, thanks to our story's three (real-life) heroes Katherine Goble (the former child prodigy but now widowed mother of 3 number-cruncher or \"computer\"); Dorothy Vaughan (a fellow \"computer\", who supervises the others but is unable to gain official recognition of the fact, and who also takes an interest in Fortran (invented 1957), as well as the new IBMs that have just reached NASA); and Mary Jackson (another \"computer\" who wants to break new ground in all directions by becoming an engineer).These three characters are played, respectively, by Taraji Henson, the Oscar-nominated Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, and it's fair to say they act their hearts out, impressing as not-nerdy-at-all scientific and engineering types. The portrayals are a warm, touching, impressive, amusing delight.Over on \"the white side\", our players include Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons and Kevin Costner - as Vivian Mitchell, Paul Stafford and Al Harrison, respectively. There's also a tiny-but-key role for Olek Krupa as Karl Zielinski (real-life Kazimierz Czarnecki), who has a superb line to deliver about being \"a Polish Jew\", and escapee of the Holocaust. He is among the \"bridge-builders\" and stereotype-breakers, as - ultimately - is Costner, who (again) takes to a 1960s role as if made for it. Harrison is a sympathetic figure, even if he effectively tells his staff to abandon family life for the duration (the upcoming mission being John Glenn's \"Friendship 7\" flight of February 1962).Mitchell and Stafford are stiff, mostly unyielding characters, and - appropriately - Jim Parsons does not quite leave Sheldon Cooper behind. In fact, even these \"progress\" gradually. Anyway, they are not obviously evil, but they are remarkably ready to accept the obscenity-absurdity of Katherine having to run to the \"coloured\" toilet back in her original place of work, and to use a separate kettle. Doubtless, these are Americans who share their country's strong Christian tradition, but forget how all men are brothers in the eyes of the Lord; and who of course believe in \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\", yet are prepared to live in a system that forgets that too.Those are powerful, unsettling, Orwellian thoughts.Tellingly, when Harrison begins to break down the barriers (even literally, in a scene whose historical accuracy one somewhat doubts), it is not because he's seen the light, but simply, pragmatically, because it's going to be more efficient in helping get the job done. Perhaps that's an OK reason, given the sheer bizarre stupidity of what they've become stuck with.Thanks to changes that Harrison and others made at NASA, and thanks to the mostly well-sensed and portrayed patriotic and scientific success that Glenn's flight (and then the Apollo missions) represented, the film is \"feelgood\" - and all the more so with the typical end-of-biopic comparisons of acted and real-life versions, complete with short biographical notes. Katherine is romanced successfully by Korea veteran Col. Jim Johnson (played by Mahershala Ali, with his usual integrity and dignity). Johnson reveals that his parents had been married 52 years, but we learn at the end that Katherine's own marriage had reached 59 years, and that she received various honours ... from Pres. Obama ... in 2015/2016. Each snippet here is telling.Which brings me to a further key thought I found myself thinking, though I do not know if it was what the makers intended. Triumphant as the film may be, it was not plain sailing after 1961, was it? With - literally - one exception, the black people portrayed in \"Hidden Figures\" are mostly free of the disillusionment-cum-surliness they might rightly feel. They are wearily accepting, but also hard-working, patriotic and middle-class-aspiring, \"normal\", and as devotedly interested in space as their white counterparts, and of course (more than) a match for them in intellect and ability, if not opportunity.This somehow suggests that everything was still to play for in 1961 - an era perhaps looking \"nicer than ours\", even if saddled with that outrageous and hideous segregation. I found myself encouraged to imagine steps seen in the film being taken more fully, firmly and quickly, more widely. To imagine more white people like Harrison bringing down barriers (even for just pragmatic reasons). Had those things happened, might America not have avoided decades more of not-dissipating African-American bitterness, resentfulness, ghettoisation, anger, crime, drugs and imprisonment? Maybe not, but maybe yes...That's a surprising take-home message from such a fine, often enjoyable and mostly inspiring film, but it's certainly one I got...",

All three are spirited, honest-to-God gals who would eventually satisfyingly win their overdue respect for their competence in the cutting-edge sphere, flags up the quintessential American spirit - winner takes the all. On paper, the story would easily fall into the pigeonhole of a hagiography with all the crevices papered over in pursuit of the straight-forward political correctness, but miraculously under the able hands of director and co- screenwriter Theodore Melfi (his second feature film), the final product is immensely enthralling and rewarding, although a deeper probing of characterization is skated over, but by dint of its tub- thumping milieu and the mounting injustice (both racism and sexism in the rarefied high-tech rung) these three women take in their dignified stride, everyone can find a congenital connection with them and involuntarily roots for them because if there is any justice in this world, this is it!Shy of expository screed on technicality, and juicy in its confrontational sparkling and homely felicity, HIDDEN FIGURES is a high achievement of orthodox entertainment from Hollywood, gives access to the lowest common denominator without being fluffy or patronizing, ambidextrously balances its innately rousing source material with glistening performances: Taraji P. Henson is a formidable force to be reckoned with and particularly eloquent in her big moment of outpourings good and proper; Octavia Spencer, exudes incredible panache against her stock appearance, reaps the token nomination for the Oscar glory; but it is high time to give a backslapping to Janelle Mon\u00e1e, only her second film credit (after MOONLIGHT 2016) for the famed chanteuse, her Mary is a firebrand but not scanty with humor and sobriety, that scene facing off a judge in the court is in my druthers, the single best delivery of the entire film, which she nails with unbelievable confidence and earnestness. Meantime, let's not begrudge our thumbs-up to the lighter-skinned counter-performers, Kevin Costner, channels his \"white face\" proponent with a heartfelt vibe in measured sagacity, and two \"black face\" antagonists, played by Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst, might not be as one-note as they let on, the modulation in their attitude shows up inviting subtlety in the script-writing.HIDDEN FIGURES, a film encourages, inspires and galvanizes its audience with a cogent message about real-life encountering with the ever-present benightedness, surprisingly not so long time ago, its timing couldn't be more opportune if we must firmly believe the world is changing into a better place, it does give us some spark of hope, doesn't it?",

And Kevin Costner loves playing the guy who does the right thing cause it's the right thing and needs no pat on the back for it.Even though I loved the subject matter, I never thought I'd walk away loving the movie so much. So good.http://cinemagardens.com",

            "review_title": "\"Hidden Figures\" finds an excellent story and turns it into a total crowd-pleaser",
            "content": "There are some classic Hollywood storytelling molds out there \u2014 frameworks that with the right story and the right talents applied, result in a feel-good, crowd-pleasing movie \u2014 the popcorn and Coca-Cola of cinema. \"Hidden Figures\" perfectly encapsulates that type of film. It balances upon a combination of a witty script both humorous and dramatic, veteran actors giving likable performances and a true story that really hits on the realities of a certain place in time in history.That time and place is not only NASA headquarters in 1961 in the height of the space race, but more generally, a racially segregated Virginia. \"Hidden Figures\" tells the story of three women caught in the intersection of both. Some of the nation's most bright and well-educated black women worked as \"computers\" for NASA, helping to verify and compute the complex math equations required to launch rockets into space. When Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) gets an opportunity to compute for the head of the Space Task Group (Kevin Costner), a position in which no one lasts long, she's the first black woman to have the opportunity, and it comes at a crucial time \u2014 right after the Russians have successfully launched the Sputnik satellite, upping the stakes of the space race.The other women are Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), the unofficial acting supervisor of the black women in the computing division who isn't being given the title or the pay despite doing the work, and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) an aspiring engineer who decides to fight for her opportunity to actually become one. The film follows each of these women as they fight against oppression both sanctioned and unsanctioned, all while supporting one another and contributing to one of the biggest scientific advances of the 20th century.Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi's sharp screenplay (based on the book by Margot Lee Shetterly) really sets the tone for \"Hidden Figures,\" starting with a terrific introductory scene in which Katherine, Dorothy and Mary's car has broken down on the way to NASA headquarters and a police officer stops to examine the situation. Schroeder and Melfi (who also directs) address racial tension head on, but they're able to approach it from the black perspective, in the sense that these women know this is how things are and have a sense of humor about it. Throughout the whole film, we're reminded how unfortunate and wrong segregation was, but the discomfort of these issues comes at the expense of the white characters who are made (and rightfully so) to seem ridiculous for their thoughts and behavior.This set up gives these lead female actors a major advantage and they all deliver. Spencer and Monae have it easy as they both have a lot of natural presence and their characters get all kinds of permission to stand up and use it. Henson's role is trickier. Katherine is as bright as her friends and a strong independent woman in her own right, but she pushes back on the oppression she faces in her own quiet way. That makes her one dramatic outburst in the film a rather big moment, even if it's maybe a tad out of character.Much of \"Hidden Figures\" plays out in traditional, exposition-heavy based-on-a-true- story fashion of fighting resistance and overcoming the odds, but it works because the story is good and the writing provides ample moments to \"fall for\" the characters. Melfi's \"St. Vincent\" was also a film that played out in somewhat clich\u00e9 fashion, but he has a way of really endearing the audience to the characters in his movies. There are so many moments when the lead characters get to game and shame the system and there's nothing more satisfying than when characters we like put the characters we don't like in their place.That's what a feel-good movie does, and that's what \"Hidden Figures\" is, and it does it better than most. Part of that is writing, but part of that is also the unique components of this particular true story. On a few occasions, white characters tell these women that they can't do something because no one ever has or there's no precedent, but the backdrop of the space race gives them a powerful example of how hard we as a country were working to do something that had never been done before. These characters were uniquely situated in the divide between America's obsession with scientific progress and its failures in social progress. They helped to catalyze both. And that's not even bringing up the issue of women in fields of science and mathematics.To say the story makes the film in this case would be unfair to the talents behind and in front of the camera, but it's the combination of the right story and the right storytellers that make \"Hidden Figures\" one of those important feel-good movies that school teachers will play in classrooms for a long time to come.~Steven CThanks for reading!

            "content": "The 1960's is probably the most significant decade in African American history. The black movements of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X made history and sadly so did their unjustly murders. But in another part of America, three African American women are chasing a white police man down the highway on their way to make history in the NASA space program in an openly racist society. Hidden Figures stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae and many more in what could be called the greatest feel good film about racial and gender discrimination.Looking at the films style and substance, you'd think it would all come together like oil and water, yet somehow it works. The film deals with heavy themes such as racism and sexism while at the same time being directed as a feel good movie. Due to the success of Katherine, Dorothy and Mary, the film can be told in this way, and luckily the script finds this sweet spot to make oil and water mix together, as it brilliantly deals with the discrimination of the 1960's while also making you smile, laugh and leave the cinema feeling good.The film features an all star cast which is often not a good sign for feel good films, but this isn't the case for Hidden Figures. Not only is the film good but so is the ensemble cast of famous faces. Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons and Mahershala Ali play their roles well in this film, and Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae are fantastic in their supporting, and at times leading roles. But the real star performance comes from Taraji P. Henson as the films lead character, Katherine Goble Johnson. Although the film is about three women who each make considerably extraordinary achievements, it is Katherine Goble who is our lead protagonist, and Henson stands tall and performs wonderfully in this leading role, standing out of the crowd of an all star cast. The speech she gives in the \"We all pee the same colour\" sequence is extremely powerful and is simply mesmerising to watch.Overall, Hidden Figures is a hidden gem. It's a well cast film with a stand out performance by Taraji P. Henson, and a conflicting mix of style and substance that somehow works beautifully together. I would highly recommend this to black women everywhere, due to its empowering representation of black women. But regardless of who you are, Hidden Figures is a satisfying feel good film that we can all take something away from.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is a very good film that depicts the story of three computers who happen to be young black women in the racially charged early 1960's. The computers calculated all of the math required to compete against the Russians in the race to space.The three stars are a super mathematician, an engineer, and a supervisor. Each woman is facing a battle against an immovable object - misogyny, racial prejudice, and a good-old boys network. Taraji Henson is terrific as Kathryn, the mathematical genius. She was outstanding, especially in one scene where she loses it to decry the silent injustices that she's had to deal with at NASA. Kevin Costner plays her crusty boss, the program leader Al, who slowly but surely starts realizing that things need to change if NASA is going to really work like a team, leverage all skills, and succeed.Janelle Monae is Mary, who dreams of being an engineer, but there are no women engineers, much less black women. She too has a mentor who sees her grit and skills, and works to support her efforts.My favorite though was Octavia Spencer as Dorothy, a programmer genius who is the true leader, and she knows it. She dreams of being a supervisor, yet she keeps running into racial prejudice from a white woman supervisor who does not even seem to realize her actions.The story is sometimes a bit uneven. There's a long love interest story going on for Kathryn. There's John Glenn's story too, and Grisham. Sometimes it seems like there was just a bit too much being crammed into the story. In the end, the dramatic finish leaves you hoping that things work out for everyone. Just enough suspense and you have a nicely wrapped up feel good movie. You should enjoy Hidden Figures.",

            "content": "There are reviews of this movie with pretty low ratings and the reasons that follow have to do with what the person feels is an overstated sense of racism at NASA at this point in time. Segregation, and hence racism in Virginia was enforced BY LAW, so you need to understand that first. There is some good fact checking that has been done about NASA, these women and that time period, and even though this movie is overstated a little, there are commenters who have said that racism pretty much didn't exist in NASA because they were focused on the mission. Well, that's far from true also. The movie does take poetic license on how it's applied and to who the effects were felt the most. For instance, this is from one site that checked the story and got details: Did Katherine have to run across the NASA Langley campus to use the bathroom? Not exactly. In Margot Lee Shetterly's book, this is something that is experienced more by Mary Jackson (portrayed by Janelle Mon\u00e1e) than Katherine Johnson. Mary went to work on a project on NASA Langley's East Side alongside several white computers. She was not familiar with those buildings and when she asked a group of white women where the bathroom was, they giggled at her and offered no help. The closest bathroom was for whites. Humiliated and angry, Mary set off on a time-consuming search for a colored bathroom. Unlike in the movie, there were colored bathrooms on the East Side but not in every building. The sprint across the campus in the movie might be somewhat of an exaggeration, but finding a bathroom was indeed a point of frustration.As for Katherine Johnson herself, Shetterly writes that when Katherine started working there, she didn't even realize that the bathrooms at Langley were segregated. This is because the bathrooms for white employees were unmarked and there weren't many colored bathrooms to be seen. It took a couple years before she was confronted with her mistake, but she simply ignored the comment and continued to use the white restrooms. No one brought it up again and she refused to enter the colored bathrooms.Another point that was made is that Katherine Johnson said she didn't FEEL racism while she was working there. You need to read in detail to understand that racism was present, although maybe not prevalent. But, what a person FEELS is unique and I know what she meant. She meant that she was wrapped up with the work and her feelings about THAT overrode any other feelings she may have had. It doesn't mean she didn't SEE racism. She CHOSE to feel the positives, since EVERY human controls their feelings whether they know it or not. You either do it actively or passively. What is TRUE is these women DID face racism at NASA, and if you think they were treated or paid like a white man working at NASA, you are pretty out of touch with the 40s-60s Southern US, which still does it's best to find subtle ways to provide more advantage to whites. I could give a few examples right here where I live, such as closing any licensing offices in predominately black areas so if they want to get an ID they have to make a very long trip, followed by passing ID laws. Subtle.They happened to be incredibly smart and NASA needed them so they accepted them even though they were black, but they weren't treated the same. The site I visited was History vs Hollywood. A good read there will fill you in to the reality of the story. For me personally, considering I KNOW how much humility, control and pride swallowing they had to go through to even be employed, I can kind of forgive the screen writing of variations of the truth, because they were surrounded by racism at the very least in many subtle ways and in some cases very overt ways. Of course the three women felt it and experienced it in different ways.Go read before you write a review blasting it for its display of racism. Frankly, it would have been a biased movie to protect the feelings of the white audience if they DIDN'T show it, and it would have been more disingenuous than the slight exaggerations that ended up in the screenplay, and THAT would have been done to sell tickets and discs.",

            "content": "I was recommended to sit down and watch \"Hidden Figures\", and I was told that it was a very emotional movie. So I tracked down a copy of this 2016 movie from writers Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi and sat down to watch it. Initially I hadn't even heard about this movie.And I will say that \"Hidden Figures\" definitely is a good movie, but it wasn't as spectacular as I was led to believe it to be. Now, don't get me wrong here, because this is definitely a good and entertaining movie, while at the same time it is a historical movie that definitely is a big part of the history of our world. But the movie just didn't blow me away.I was really impressed with the cast ensemble they had managed to get together for this movie, and there were some really good acting performances being delivered here. I mean, the movie had the likes of Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons and Mahershala Ali on the cast list.It should be said that the three lead actresses - Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e - really carried the movie quite phenomenally. And while Jim Parsons is by no means a poor actor, then it was just difficult to put his role as Sheldon from \"Big Bang Theory\" aside and see him in a new light. Just like Daniel Radcliff is always stuck as being Harry Potter, then Jim Parsons will always be stuck as Sheldon.The story told in \"Hidden Figures\" is a good story, especially because of the historical importance that there was to the stories of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson and all the other ladies in the same situation back in the 1960s. So there on that account alone, then \"Hidden Figures\" is actually a movie that is well worth watching.One can't help but shake one's head in disbelief because of the racial segregation that were taking place in the USA back in the 1960s. It is just so far out there that people could have been so narrowminded. But that is how it was back then, and it is portrayed with impact in the movie, thanks to director Theodore Melfi.My rating of \"Hidden Figures\" lands on a six out of ten stars. What was holding the movie back from getting a higher rating from me, was the fact that the contents and events in the storyline just weren't all that appealing to me, the movie lacked momentum and drive. Sure, this is a historical important event, but for entertainment purposes, it was a bit stale.",

            "content": "Films based on historical events can be challenging. Many are just a collection of stories put together with no real narrative. Other times they attempt to cram as much information in as possible, regardless of its relevance. Hidden Figures is storytelling at its finest, as we're quickly and gracefully shown Katherine's brilliance at a young age, then seamlessly brought into the present, where we also meet Dorothy and Mary. The scene is so simple, yet clearly shows us that although these three women share in similar situations and struggles, they each have very unique personalities. Minor spoilers below:Hidden Figures deals not just with their work at NASA but also the challenges they face in their personal lives, both as friends and individually as wives and parents. One thing that struck me is that this is a film about triumph. Every story they told had a happily ever after. But that doesn't mean that it was without drama. The filmmakers were careful not to turn the film into a statement, something that could have easily been done, and instead just used the facts of the time to move the story forward. The tension felt because of racism and sexism was real. When a character was encouraged you joined the cheering squad. When they were discouraged we felt their dread, however fleeting. When shown how unfair life was at that time, we were uncomfortable. But most importantly, watching these women fight for their small victories, we realized that we all can accomplish our dreams. This movie is a story about real life heroes. The acting all around was amazing as well. You can tell there was a lot of passion in this movie. This is the type of movie you share with your kids, with your parents, with anyone who enjoys a movie that makes them feel hopeful and inspired. I usually don't like the feel good movies, but this is one that will be on repeat whenever I need it.",

The picture and sound are first-rate and the several \"making of\" extras are interesting. Even with some inaccuracies and Hollywood liberties in story telling this is a must-see movie.Most of us in modern times think of small machines, maybe one sitting on our lap, when we hear the word \"Computer.\" But in the 1960s as the USA geared up for space exploration electronic computers were not in wide use yet. \"Computers\" were the people who were very good with math and who would use mechanical calculators and pencils to make the long, difficult calculations. This story is about several black women who took jobs as Computers at Langley in Virginia as the technical team, a group of white men in white shirts and dark ties, tried to figure out how to get a man into orbit and retrieve him. The mathematics for all that was yet undiscovered.Enter the main character, Taraji P. Henson as Katherine G. Johnson, who as a young girl demonstrated a genius for mathematics. She began working as a Computer, the men viewed it as a clerical job beneath them. But Katherine was not satisfied with just doing as she was assigned, she was inquisitive, she eventually provided the ideas and the math approach to calculating how to do it all. She only died recently (Feb. 2020) at the age of 103. Perhaps, we don't really know, if she had not been part of that team we might not have won the race to the moon.The movie also deals with racial discrimination in general in the 1960s. My wife and I were both teenagers during the 1960s, we remember well such things as \"colored\" bathrooms and \"colored\" entrances to businesses, as my wife says today \"It is embarrassing to see how it was.\"Two other key black characters are Octavia Spencer as Dorothy Vaughan who became the chief programmer for the new IBM that eventually put most of the human computers out of work. And Janelle Mon\u00e1e as Mary Jackson who successfully petitioned a judge to allow her to take night college classes at an all-white school so that she could get her Engineer certification and work as an Aeronautical Engineer for NASA.Also good is Kevin Costner as Al Harrison who is the overall director of the effort at Langley, Kirsten Dunst as the office supervisor Vivian Mitchell who answered certain questions with \"That's just the way it is.\" Plus Jim Parsons as Paul Stafford, the lead mission scientist who seemed to resent Katherine's role of checking everyone's math work, even his, but he eventually gave her the respect she was due.Good movie of an important time and important activity in the long, gradual process to overcome the racial prejudice that seems indelibly ingrained in our society.",

            "content": "Now that more black voices are being heard in Hollywood, I realize how badly one-sided history has been taught to American students. Thank God it's changing.We are better off knowing the full story.In the last few years, films like \"12 Years a Slave\" and \"Selma\" have brought to life stories too long neglected, and \"Hidden Figures\" is a revelation. I grew up in the Apollo era; every rocket launch was a national event, with every American reaching for the stars. The turmoil in the streets notwithstanding, the space program provided a sense of optimism for the future. That was the era in which \"Star Trek\" was born, and through \"Star Trek\" some of that hope survives still.Yet, in all that time, nobody told us about three black women who did as much as anyone else to make it happen. We did not know that a black woman helped to get John Glenn into orbit. (In Ron Howard's otherwise excellent \"Apollo 13,\" we are never told about that same woman's role in saving the flight.) These and other oversights are corrected by \"Hidden Figures.\"The film tells the story of NASA mathematicians Katherine G. Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughn, though Johnson, excellently portrayed by Taraji P. Hanson, is the film's main focus. All three work at NASA in 1961 Virginia. The film doesn't flinch from the blatant racial discrimination of the era. The only bathroom reserved for black women, for instance, is half a mile from Katherine's desk. Vaughn's story is almost as compelling as Johnson's, but also funnier; there's a reason Octavia Spencer is up for an Academy Award. Anyone who's been working beneath his abilities and had a frosty relationship with his supervisor will identify with Vaughn immediately, and appreciate how she resolves it. I also have a personal reason for appreciating Spencer; she reminds me of every black female boss I've ever had. Actually, there are three facets to \"Hidden Figures\" (and I wish Hanson's hadn't been so well hidden): the civil rights aspect, the excitement and progress of the space program, and, at last, a film which doesn't denigrate intelligent people. \"Hidden Figures\" is easily accessible by anyone, but does not portray having intelligence as a bad thing. Since most Hollywood films are aimed at the dumbest possible market, I can tell you that this alone makes \"Hidden Figures\" a welcome breath of fresh air. I should mention Kevin Costner, who plays project head Al Harrison. Al is generally calm and distant, as you would expect a NASA engineer to be, but he has one scene where he isn't. It's a complete departure and an unnecessarily jarring note.\"Hidden Figures\" isn't perfect, by any means. The plotting is fairly conventional, and the scenes of the women at home could fit into just about any movie. The script doesn't try to give its characters much in the way of depth, but that's not the filmmaker's purpose, anyway. There is a whole aspect of American history which has been overlooked for far too long, and \"Hidden Figures\" does a worthy job of making that right.",

It has a charismatic ensemble cast and a story that comes across so right in a time when everything seems so wrong.It celebrates the unsung, or at least largely unknown outside of their field; it calls out prejudice and denounces the marginalising of communities and genders; it makes mind-numbing mathematics appear accessible (proof, if you still needed it, of how movies are a grand illusion); and it appeals to those who are always looking to the stars \u2013 if not to dream about getting there, then at least to wonder about our place among them.The three central figures here, all winningly portrayed, are also trying to find their place in life while constantly being told what and where that place should be.They work in a colour-segregated building (this is the American South, after all, at a time when the Civil Rights Movement is only just gathering steam) as human \"computers\", assigned to perform complex calculations on flight and space data by hand. Even washrooms are segregated, a point the movie stresses several times to (unfortunately) near-caricature levels which, to me, tended to diminish the impact of that particular aspect.Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) is a capable administrator long denied a supervisory role; Katherine Goble (Taraji P. Henson) is a mathematics prodigy who gets a big break when she is assigned as a computer to the all-white Space Task Group, only to face indifference \u2013 at best \u2013 from her colleagues; and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) dreams of becoming an engineer in a state where engineers are (a) male and (b) white, and the only option for her is to be allowed to attend classes at a whites- only school.The film collapses their respective struggles \u2013 which took place years apart \u2013 into one heady period in 1961 when the United States and Soviet Union were involved in a desperate space race, and the US was lagging behind.Now that sort of conflating is OK for the purposes of telling a dramatic story on screen, one that does not have the luxury of being read slowly over time like a book or historical record.While the three women and their families as depicted are real characters, most of the white folks (save for the astronauts) are not. Kevin Costner's Nasa boss Al Harrison is a composite figure, as are Jim Parsons' uptight statistician/theorist Paul Stafford and Kirsten Dunst's strict and aloof administrative supervisor Vivian Mitchell.Stafford and Mitchell are meant to reflect certain attitudes prevalent among white men and women in those times but this sort of conflating, on the other hand, renders them intentionally unsympathetic characters who might as well be cardboard standees with embedded voice chips.The same almost goes for Costner's Harrison, who comes perilously close to achieving escape velocity into the wild blue yonder of \"white saviour\". \"That's a very nice rocket, honey. Now you get to sleep so Mommy can run off to her night job of running a hip-hop empire.\" - Moments of genuinely felt triumph, quiet suffering, and ebullient celebration (Mahershala Ali's proposal scene is surprisingly affecting in spite of its supreme corniness) will hold your attention between the absolutely riveting test flight scenes that culminate in John Glenn's (Glen Powell) attempt to become the first American to orbit the Earth.And although it is set over half a century ago in a distant part of the world, the film's core lessons still resonate and apply to any place and any situation today.If you've got a problem, and you choose to let prejudice, ego or other types of personal maladjustment blind you to parties that can contribute towards a solution...

            "content": "Theodore Melfi's incredible film depicting the lives and careers of three African-American women whose work was extremely influential in the early days of NASA's Mercury, Atlas, and Apollo missions will hit close to home for many. In all likelihood, there may not have been successful launches, orbits, and landings if it weren't for these brave women who refused to back down and take the back seat to white men and women at a time that even government buildings still segregated restrooms, water fountains, and \"community\" coffee pots. Every once in a while, there is a biographical drama that packs a powerful socio-political message within a simple but brilliant story that is told incredibly successfully. Hidden Figures is a film that should have been released many years ago. How stories like this one go untold, is bewildering. Between the powerful performances, excellent writing, meticulous direction, and fantastic score, this is definitely a film to catch in theaters this weekend.Unlike many biographical dramas, there is a comprehensive nature to this film as it contains two important stories. There is the foreground story featuring the women at the center of the movie, but there is also the story of the state of the U.S.' domestic socio-political policies at a time of civil rights unrest--especially in places like Virginia. Both stories parallel one another and serve to pack a powerful punch. After watching this film, it is clear that this film wishes it had existed in the 1960s. Within the former story, the focus is primarily on the life and career of Katherine Goble followed by Dorothy Vaughn, and to a lesser extent, Mary Jackson. Each woman specializes in a different STEM (as it is now commonly referred) area. Katherine is a mathematical genius matched by none, Dorothy understand early computer language better than anyone at NASA, and Mary is an aspiring engineer with a brilliant mind for aerospace design. The latter story, underscoring the socio-political civil rights unrest, is certainly highlighted in the film but never takes the focus completely off the story in the foreground; however, is vitally important to this powerful story with a message that those who you least expect to rise to be leaders in their respective fields, can and will!Although this truly is a powerful film with a beautiful message that is just as relevant today as it would have been 50 years ago, it never quite hits the mark that I had hoped it would. Suffice it to say, there are some remarkable scenes with powerful speeches, but the film never quite hits that emotional mark as intensely as it should. I realize that some of what transpired in the Space Task room, wind tunnels, and courtroom may have been taken from transcripts for authenticity, as this is a movie, I feel that there should have been more of a dramatic license taken out to increase the emotional impact of the film. It certainly has a moderately high emotional impact, but there was definitely the potential to take it up several more degrees. Two scenes come to mind. (1) Katherine challenging the segregation policies at NASA as it relates to common comforts such as restrooms and coffee and (2) Mary positioning the court to permit her enrollment for graduate level engineering classes held at an all-white school. Dorothy also has a couple of encounters with her superior but they are more subtle--no less powerful and important to the film. In regards to the scene in which Katherine confronts Mr. Harrison, the scene feels a little cut short of where it should have ended and Mr. Harrison's (Kevin Costner) response could have been more dramatic. When in the courtroom as Mary was addressing the judge, this would have been the perfect time for a speech that would have brought a flood of tears to the eyes, but it stops short of where it could have gone too. Over all, the screenplay is excellently written. These are just two areas that I feel could have struck a more powerful emotional cord. As it is, these scenes are still some of the most brilliant in the film and leave an impact.One of Mr. Harrison's lines in the film contains a large degree of irony. The line was something to the effect of \"How can the U.S. government justify NASA when it is consistently unable to get into and explore space?\" The irony therein is seen in today's defunding of NASA for, essentially, that very concept. NASA did not lose the bulk of its government funding due to any particular presidential administration but from remaining in the 80s and never launching into the 21st century. After the Space Shuttle program, NASA did very little to grow--its technology and engineering remained fairly stagnant. Sure, combinations technologies greatly benefited from NASA engineers, but that is not what made NASA an exciting organization from the 60s thru the 90s. What made NASA great was the perception of being explorers--exploration excited a society! Once NASA no longer appeared to be focused on exploration and shifted its focus to communication technologies, it lost that public support that was such a part of what brought so many people together. In many ways, the perceptions and issues facing NASA prior to and during the early missions is plaguing it today. Instead of an inability to launch a man into space and orbit the earth (later to land on the moon), there is now the demonstrable evidence and perception that NASA has an inability to create manned vessels capable of exploring space. More than a biography of the glory days of NASA, this is a story of three women who, against all odds, rose to the challenges they faced on a daily basis to prove that women are capable of anything that a man can do.

Unfortunately, It feels the need to provide a white saviour narrative, to address white fragility.It is a movie that you could show to children, as it can start them on a path to understanding Jim Crow, as well as inspire an interest in STEM in members of minorities.I recommend this to anyone that wants to appreciate how important African Americans have been to American prosperity. 8/10.",

            "content": "It's clear from many reviews here that there's considerable discontent with some of the facts in Hidden Figures but rather like Braveheart some people just miss the point of movies for entertainment and think because it's a factual story it should be steadfastly accurate with its narrative. I realise that in order to make an entertaing picture it's necessary to change some facts for fantasy to avoid it being boring and this film delivers entertainment by the bucket load. I was aware of John Glenn back when I was a teenager, believe it not, by a record by Walter Brennan called The Epic Ride of John H Glenn and after two hours, this is what we get. The lead up tells how a team of black women are used as human computers, to help enable progress in the space race between Russia and the States. This failure to treat these women as fellow human beings looks shocking today and growing up in England I was not really that aware of the prejudice that pervaded society and would have been disgusted by it even then. The film does rather hit you over the head as propaganda but it is such fun to watch, particularly when the NASSA boss shows sympathy with Kathryn, the genius mathmetician assigned to him and overrules those snubbing her. Tarraji P Henson plays Kathryn and Kevin Costner her boss and i'm surprised only Octavia Spencer in a more minor role was the only actress to get an Oscar nomination as I felt Kevin and Tarraji were perfectly cast. Nice to see Jim Parsons in a role too, albeit type cast as a scientist after spoofing it up for so long in The Big Bang Theory. I loved this movie.",

            "review_title": "NASA's Black Women Were Extremely Important",
            "content": "Hidden Figures is a drama film that tells the true story of Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae), the three black women who changed the face of NASA during the Space Race of the 60s. Johnson was a mathematical prodigy who helped come up with mathematical solutions to a successful launch and reentry of Friendship 7, the spaceship that took John Glenn into orbit. Vaughan was a mathematician who learned FORTRAN language to become the first woman to be able to run the IBM at NASA, which was integral to the missions. She was also the first black woman to be a supervisor of staff, a feat she had to fight extremely hard to get. Jackson was a mathematician who worked and fought to be the first black female engineer at NASA, desegregating a high school in the process. The acting between these three women is phenomenal. Each has their own distinct personality, and the chemistry they have for each other helps establish their close friendship. Taraji P. Henson is an especially amazing stand out, as she has to display a knowledge of complicated numbers and equations in a convincing way, which is very hard when the math is as difficult as it is in this film. Her tenacity, which helps her win over Kevin Costner's character, as well as a begrudging respect from a character played by Jim Parsons (not that either of their opinions really matter, but it did help her actually make a difference) is beautiful. I'm glad people are finally starting to notice her as a great actress (my first time falling for her charm and superb acting was in Hustle and Flow, though most people may know her as Cookie from Empire). She has been acting since 1998. Monae is also tenacious, as she fights to meet the impossible standards set upon her to become an engineer, by fighting in court to go to an all white High School's night classes. I'm hoping Janelle Monae actually gets into acting more. She is just as amazing at it as she is with her music. Octavia Spencer is tenacious too, but in a more mother-like sense. She fights for her fellow black women, and pushes for their success, while also fighting for her own. She herself must push back against a character played by Kirsten Dunst, who is your typical \"I'm not racist, but\u0085\" type person. Unfortunately, it seemed Dunst had the least development to work with, and at times seemed a little too one- dimensional. It didn't have much of an impact on the story at all, but I felt it could've been just a little better, as Jim Parsons' character is in the film. In the end though, each woman has an important part to play, and each does so well.The direction of this movie was done by Theodore Melfi, whose only other director credit was for St. Vincent in 2014. So 20th Century Fox was taking a huge risk, and it payed off. The bright colours of the movie when there was justice prevailing helped set a happier tone to the more muted colour pallet used in scenes that actively showed the oppression. The camera work conveyed both moments of comedy, balanced with dramatic moments. Three black women were the focus of the story, so they were made the focus, allowing the white characters to exist, and work and change, without bogging down the movie with their stories. This movie is amazing inside and out. One of the best I've seen in a long time, and one I hope empowers women, as well as the black community. It can be inspiring to everyone, sure, but those are the groups it focuses on, and those are the ones that will benefit from the representation the most. Please go support this movie. Let Hollywood know that we want more stories that are representative. Also, if you want, pick up the book that inspired the movie by Margot Lee Shetterly. 100/100",

To a lesser extent I feel the same way here. I felt right from the get go that this story about three really smart black women working for NASA in the days of the segregated South was being overplayed Hollywood-style. If you're going to show me discrimination, show me discrimination to these persons like it really happened, not the way it presents most effectively in a Hollywood production with an anti-discrimination agenda. The way this played was so obvious and almost cartoon style that I felt suspicious about the whole deal even where much of the story was absolutely true. So take out the manufactured racial and sexual misinformation because I'd like the real scoop on these wonderful, talented and courageous folks.As I understand it, Katherine Johnson was accepted as a peer by the other persons she worked with - so please tell me THAT story (which to me is much more interesting than the movie contrivances)? Show Katherine being a true educational and workplace genius accepted by her white male co-workers when outside the KKK has meetings and blacks are directed to the back of the bus. All you do by distorting the facts for the subjects of this movie is to give the detractors something to work with. I would have preferred, and appreciated more, a straight movie about what these women achieved along the lines of Race, which didn't seem contrived in the least. For me, dishonestly presenting the details (on which the movie focuses way too much) just denigrates the amazing true story.",

            "content": "This is a very good movie. Even better is there is factual basis for the story of the early NASA space program. Is it entirely factual? Not totally, but close enough. There are a few things changed by the screen writers, the true story speaks for itself- \"Hidden Figures is based off of the nonfiction book Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, written by historian Margot Lee Shetterly. Shetterly's book is fantastically well- researched, walking readers through the social and political world in which Johnson, Vaughan, and Jackson lived, and telling a detailed narrative of their lives and the work they accomplished.\"The males in the story ironically are the ones where reality is stretched. Kevin Costner and Jim Parsons characters are scripted different from the real people. That is done for more effective dramatic effect. The positive messages from the film do reverberate. \"From now on there are only one color of people at NASA.\" Great message which I wish would infect more people. John Glenn's - \" Get the girl to do it. I want this human computer to check the output of the electronic computer, and if she says they're good, you know, I'm good to go as part of one of my pre- flight checklists,\" might just be the most amazing real story. It exposes that a computer is only as good as what the programmer has put into it. When new data first becomes known, the computer can not possibly put it out until it is in there. This is why computer projections still get proved wrong all the time.This is a great example of how team work was needed to get this country going on JFK's \"New Frontier\". While the story has happened before in history it can never be illustrated better than it is here.As for it happening prior, before World War 2, a company named EA Link developed and manufactured flight simulators to train many of the pilots who flew in the war for the Allies. A lessor known group of 7 Women who worked at Link were known as their \"Flight Simulator Ladies\" who helped build these essential training devices. Their stories have been sort of lost to history. While this NASA story is accurately recorded in this film, the parallels of importance in both groups of women are important.Women were the first programmers of ENIAC, the first Computer ever built. There were 8 women, now all deceased who did this too. That was made into another movie.Hollywood is catching up making films about women's contributions in history. It is a good thing women took action before waiting to become famous by leading the way in these and other important events in history.",

There were some great moments of humor, and not the kind of humor one might expect. Most movie humor is either slapstick or cheeky lines, but this was different. I had not planned to see this movie after seeing the trailer. The trailer made it look like a dry history lesson. My friends on social media told me to see it, and I am so glad I did. Yes, it's history. But it's not dry.Maybe it was even sensationalized a little. Of course movies have to have drama and action, and this one does, and it uses some great visuals from the space program, but there were also some unexpected points at which I really identified with the main characters, and I wasn't expecting it. Here come the spoilery parts. One of the plot points was that the women were not given credit for their work or opportunities because they didn't have the college degrees and qualifications on paper to do what they were already doing. There was a line that went, \"Computers don't author reports.\" Replace that with \"techs\" and that's an experience I've actually had at a job. I was expecting to see depictions of racism and sexism, and those were there, of course. (I'm not going to go into more detail about that because more qualified people have already written about it.) I wasn't expecting that -ism that doesn't even have a name which made me see myself in the main character. I was already identifying with her a little from the start because the story started with a bright child far ahead of her class, and that was me as a kid. Coincidentally, right before the main movie came on, the theater showed a preview of another movie that also had a bright child in it, and the drama was between the dad who wanted to give her a normal childhood and the grandmother who wanted to give her educational opportunities. When the preview was over I leaned over to Tom and whispered, \"Speaking as someone who was a gifted child once, I'm rooting for grandma.\" And then Hidden Figures started and there was another bright child on the screen. I'd be primed to identify with her immediately. Maybe it wasn't so coincidental? I really enjoyed seeing the NASA stuff, too. Who doesn't like rockets? When I was a child, my parents were always telling me that I was born the year a man first walked on the moon. My whole generation grew up idolizing astronauts, didn't we? A lot of people think only the Boomers are still interested in the space race, but a lot of people my age grew up watching the moon shots on TV. I had read and watched a lot about the space program and even met one of the moon men once, but I hadn't heard the story told in Hidden Figures before. It was amazing to see this familiar subject, so drenched in golden nostalgia, made fresh and new again. I predict awards for this movie. I also predict the new geek catchphrase is going to be, \"I'm not Russian.\" I know I'm just waiting for a chance to say it sometime.",

I knew there were race problems in America in the early 1960s, but figured somewhere like Nasa would be free of such terrible behaviour. How wrong was I? There were so many scenes where my jaw dropped and I turned to look at my wife in disbelief as to what was being depicted.But it gets worse.The issue standing centre stage might be overt racism, but to add insult to injury there's also a massive dose of sexism thrown in at the same time. I liked how this came from both the 'white' and the 'black' community. If the sexism had been depicted as a white-only phenomenon it would have started to come across as an anti-white film, but that was not the case.Everything about Hidden Figures oozes with professionalism. The script is superb. The cinematography is spot-on. The acting from everyone is tremendous. And the attention to detail with the 1960s set and costumes is worthy of an award.If you harbour even the slightest bit of racism then hopefully this movie will make you have a complete re-thing, but even if you think you don't have a racist bone in your body this film might just make you think twice. There's a wonderful line when Vivian Mitchell says 'Despite what you may think, I have nothing against y'all' and Dorothy Vaughan replies 'I know, I know you probably believe that.'. She says it in such a way that it sounds like she is agreeing, but the truth is that Dorothy Vaughan (her boss) does have issues, she just doesn't realise. it.And probably the best bit of the movie is the speech Katherine Johnson makes.

But that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie.As a movie, Hidden Figures is very entertaining. The movie follows the fortunes of NASA mathematician Katherine G Johnson and her friends as they deal with the challenges of being black women in a world run by white men. This is very much a feel-good movie, with adversity to overcome, crusty authority figures to win over, a great mission to accomplish, and a little romance for seasoning. The movie hits hard on the awfulness of the Jim Crow south and the merit of its leads. I'd say the only problematic dramatic weakness is that Johnson's role basically runs out before the end and she becomes a bit of a bystander.As for that question, did this really happen, well, the website informationisbeautiful.net answer is, more-or-less. The movie compresses time enormously, so that, for example, it shows a segregated NASA in 1961, three years after the agency stopped segregating facilities. Many of the events of the movie did happen to some extent, but most of them happened in the 1950s. And the real Katherine said she never felt oppressed at work, meaning the big scene of her going off about it is pure fiction.And like most movies, the title characters are portrayed as being far more important than they were. Katherine was a prodigy who graduated college when she was 18, but she was working amongst hundreds of geniuses. The movie does a service in highlighting the forgotten contributions of black women to the space program, but Hollywood hates the idea that history is pushed forward by large teams working together more often than by lone geniuses bucking the system.How much of a problem this is will depend on the individual. I'm disappointed by the facile Hollywood approach to history, but it rarely ruins the movie for me. I did, for example, enjoy The Imitation Game, even though it was obvious that some of it pretty much had to be nonsense. Hidden Figures is a feel-good movie that made me feel good.

The movie goes out of its way to show how tough black women's lives were in the workplace: 'colored' toilets, restricted prospects for advancement and constant daily humiliations from white co-workers (one of them is given her own coffee dispenser next to the one the white staff use). Writer/director Theodore Melfi shows us their home lives too, which are surprisingly similar to the lives of white folk. The number-crunching sequences are executed crisply enough not to overwhelm the audience with mathematics.The script perhaps slightly over-eggs the three women's vicissitudes to heighten the drama, but the three actresses (Taraji Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e) give rock-solid performances with very few moments of 'grandstanding'. Kevin Costner is similarly 'solid' as the head of the Space Research Division.This is another film, like last month's LION, that's bursting with the 'feel-good factor'. The feel-good factor is something HIDDEN FIGURES (if you'll excuse another very un-PC pun) delivers in spades.",

            "content": "I couldn't help but think of this movie in relation to the 1983 movie \"The Right Stuff.\" That film honoured the first seven American astronauts in the Mercury program. This movie honours the vital contributions to that program of African American women - largely behind the scenes and often not getting the credit they deserved. The movie focuses on three women in particular: Katherine Gobel/Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae). All three are brilliant in their respective fields: Katherine as a mathematician, Dorothy as a programmer and Mary as an engineer. All three work for NASA in the early days of the space program as the Mercury program is just beginning, and all three are involved in the vital calculations necessary to launch, orbit and re-enter capsules. In the midst of the work, the women are forced to deal with things such as riding at the back of the bus, segregated bathrooms and the prejudices of their co-workers. Henson and Spencer seemed somewhat more central to the story and offered good performances. Monae - better known as a singer than an actress - seems to fade away a bit compared to those two, but still does a fine job with the role.Truthfully, race was really as central a theme to this movie as was the space race. While it was all set in the context of the space race between the USA and the USSR, it was also set in the early 1960's at the NASA facility that was located in Virginia - a state where segregation was still an accepted and every day fact of life. And, of course, the women are not just African Americans - they're women, and they have to deal with sexism as well - even from some African American males, who don't seem to know what to make of them working in such important jobs. The scenes depicting the reality of life in the south in the era are sobering, and once the Mercury astronauts are introduced there's a lot of tension involved - although much of that is mitigated by the fact that we've seen the astronauts' stories and the basic story of the space flights in \"The Right Stuff.\" But it was inspiring to see the contributions of Katherine and Dorothy and Mary and others like them.It's a well done movie. Some of the characters are composite characters. That isn't really a big deal and was probably necessary to give some focus to the movie. Actually, two of the most important NASA figures - Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) and Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) were composites. There were some scenes that were very dramatic but that were created for the movie. Harrison (and since he didn't exist - no one else) never smashed down a \"Coloured Women\" restroom sign, for example. It was a powerful scene, but completely made up. I want to suggest that Parsons was a superb choice for the role of Stafford. His role as Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory makes it easy to relate to him as a jealous and arrogant scientist who seems to look down on everyone else's work - and he proved here that he can handle such a character in a dramatic role as well - although if I were Parsons, I might be concerned a bit with the possibility of type casting.It's also a bit jarring in the year 2017 to see the state of technology in the era. I'm a child of the 1960's and grew up without computers, but even so I'm so steeped in today's culture that when I saw the sign \"Coloured Computers\" for the first time, I thought how ridiculous it was that even the computers that African Americans used were segregated. It took me a few minutes to realize that the African American women WERE the computers, doing the necessary calculations. NASA was just in the process of having a huge and primitive IBM computing machine built to take over the job of doing their calculations. Seeing people working frantically on all of the complex equations in the movie was a bit disorienting.This is a very deliberately paced movie. It's interesting all the way through. I wouldn't say it's an intense movie very often, but it's a very watchable movie that pays deserved tribute to a largely forgotten but courageous and determined group of African American women who played a vital role in the beginning of America's space program.

The sets reproduce the 50&60ies quite well, as space adept you might also love the technical scenes of the rocket gear in action, but it somehow ends there. A bit curious it made it to the Oscar nominations IMO, at least it didn't win any rightly.

            "content": "This year's crop of Academy Award-nominated films for 'Best Picture' was a crowded one that saw three films starring predominantly African-American casts. In 'Hidden Figures,' we get to see stories that have not previously been widely told about the important roles African-American women had in America's space race against the Soviet Union.In 'Figures,' we follow the challenges faced by three \"human computers\" at NASA who fight their own personal battles for advancement amid the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement. Specifically, Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) are profiled, as the exceptionally talented women make incremental strides toward better lives for their families. The film most notably revolves around the life of Johnson, who is a former prodigy-turned-math superstar. Johnson is called upon to become the first African-American to serve in NASA's Flight Research Division, which is monumental accomplishment in and of itself. But she joins at a time when the US is in the throes of the space race, which means it is constantly a high-pressure environment.There are a few things about 'Figures' that work well. In addition to the script itself and the acting performances, the film is based on a true story - and not in a loose way. Additionally, the relationship between the NASA department head (played by Kevin Costner) and Johnson is touching and shows how when the stakes are high in a situation, people can look past differences that might otherwise cloud their view of someone else. It helps that there are more stereotypical characters cast in 'Figures' as shown in performances from Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons, both of whom do respectable jobs. But what 'Figures' really does well is it does not take itself too seriously. Sure, there are plenty of tense and emotional scenes, but there are also a number of laughs that lighthearted moments that keep things from getting too dark and depressing.'Hidden Figures' is one of the most heartfelt underdog stories that hearkens back to films like 'Remember the Titans,' and is an example of how quality films based on powerful true stories can still find audiences in this day and age.",

            "review_title": "Equivocal",
            "content": "\"Hidden Figures,\" I must first say, is a perfect title; the double meaning encapsulates the two main thrusts of the picture: first, revealing the figures of African-American women whose importance to the space program at NASA has been hidden by historical racial and sexual marginalization and, second, discovering the figures of mathematics and engineering needed for the success of the Space Race. Ultimately, the equation proposed here is that the STEM disciplines are an equalizing and vital force societally. It's similar to the statement in \"Lincoln\" (2012) using Euclid to elaborate on equality and truth, except here that proof is derived from differential equations, including Euler's method. Indeed, that's a laudatory message, but the title is not the only factor in this movie to be an equivocality. \"Hidden Figures\" also reveals some of the same unfortunate tropes and mischaracterizations seen time and again by Hollywood in dealing with racial and societal issues. Although excellent in theory, many but not every number in this picture adds up.I don't necessarily care about simplifying history with composite characters, fictions to illustrate items of historical relevance and jiggering the timelines to make for a cohesive cinematic narrative, but I detest tropes such as the white male savior and noble bigot--employed to assuage the audience of any fears that their society might not be so much more enlightened now or, perish the thought, they themselves might not be. Such avoidance of challenging the spectator solves nothing. \"Hidden Figures\" is certainly not the worst offender in this respect; the last Best Picture winner, \"Green Book\" (2018), for instance, is almost entirely comprised of this rubbish and from the perspective of its white protagonist, to boot. Nevertheless, we get ahistorical scenes such as Kevin Costner--the same white savior from \"Dances with Wolves\" (1990) no less--integrating bathrooms by knocking down the sign designating one of them for \"colored\" women. Other characters who display personal and institutional racism are likewise inevitably redeemed as they help to further promote the well-being of the black women, from the police officer escorting them to work to a workplace gesture of kindness as simple as bringing one a cup of coffee. Outside of a brief library scene, there doesn't appear to be one irredeemable bigot here, which is remarkable for a movie about overcoming prejudice set in 1960s Virginia.Related to this comforting cinematic hand holding is the modern-day aversion to depicting smoking even for authenticity. If you've seen documentary footage of employees of NASA in the '60s and afore, or experienced that era first hand, it becomes apparent that the hidden figures within this picture are smoke and cigarette-filled ashtrays. Instead, we get Costner chewing gum. It takes some oblivious sanctimony to rid one dangerous habit, which in the grand scheme of things has only become proscribed recently, for concerns of their bad influence, only to continue the dissemination of dangerous tropes privileging white characters, which are older than film itself.On the other hand, movies have likewise long assumed that scribbling nonsense could be passed off as real mathematics, but \"Hidden Figures\" reportedly hired mathematician Rudy Horne to consult on the equations pictured here, so that even though the specific computations here aren't exact to history, they're arguably more faithful than the depictions of race and sex, let alone cancer sticks. Moreover, some of the best visuals here involve the repetition of the women displaying their STEM-related talents. The picture begins with a scene of a young Katherine Goble solving a problem on the chalkboard at school that is later referenced when Costner hands Taraji P. Henson a piece of chalk at a meeting concerning John Glenn's upcoming mission to orbit the planet. Another introductory scene establishes Octavia Spencer's Dorothy Vaughan as mechanically gifted in fixing a broken-down car, a skill set she later employs to supervise the new IBM mainframe computers at Langley. Some fine acting led by Henson also helps with the intended feel-good entertainment.More impressively, however, this is a nice compliment picture to the white-dominant and overtly-masculine \"The Right Stuff\" (1983), and one of the best shots here is of Spencer leading her fellow human computers down the corridor--referencing a similar shot of the Mercury Seven in the Philip Kaufman film. Even the score adds a new facet to the usual trumpeting in space films. The fact that \"Hidden Figures\" adds to the representation and the general cosmos of the Space Race picture alone makes it worthwhile. Indeed, despite its faults, it also has the right stuff.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is an incredibly well shot, directed, and edited movie, with great cinematography, acting and soundtrack. It is always great to learn about names who helped to deliver outstanding human feats, and to recognize them for their contribution. Right from the beginning of the film, it establishes the tone of the movie, one in which people of color must be wary of authoritative figures. The opening scene set the theme of the film, and forebode the prejudice and discrimination these women would face throughout their career. I have to say, I am very impressed by this movie. The way in which it tells the story, and by the screenplay: self-deprecating and blunt, yet truthful, is very effective. The screenwriters did an excellent job at finding that balance between humor, passion, and suffering. I'd also like to note, that the story is based on the book by Margot Lee Shetterly. Cinematography and directing are major contributors to the success of this film, with the use of well thought out shots to create maximum effect. The use of long shots are well positioned, and enhances the effect of individuals being empowered, or of isolation. For example, there's a shot where all the African-American computers are walking to another building, and the scene shows them walking into a hallway using a long shot from some distance away, depicting a sense of power in numbers. However, in another instance, Katherine has just had a door shut in her face, and when she turns around, a long shot is used to emphasize the empty space around her - this time, depicting desolation. The cast as well is simply amazing in the film, and pretty much everyone fully embraces their characters. Henson, Spencer, and Monae, depict an easy bond between their characters, and their banter is seemingly effortless. They deliver their lines with appropriate amounts of sass, wit, and intelligence in respect to each of their individual characters. Monae, in particular has a very strong headed character, and she pulls it off perfectly. Costner does well in his role as project leader too. However, Dunst and Parsons give more of an average performance. Dunst's accent is quite weird to hear, and Parsons might just be better of sticking with being a comedic physicist. Also, it would have been better if more information was given as to what these two characters actually did. They are in positions of relative power, but don't really seem to be doing much except sit around and give orders. I also have to say, that the soundtrack greatly complements the theme of the movie. Apparently, Pharrell Williams, a producer, oversaw all musical elements of the movie, including the soundtrack. Kudos to him, the music was enjoyable and added character to the scenes. One of the main things that may or may not be an issue, but which I consider important in noting, is that John Glenn, the astronaut, is seen and preserved as a hero. When he is introduced on screen, he shakes hands and chats with the three women - showing that he harbors no prejudice towards their gender or skin color. While this may have happened, I have an inkling that it probably didn't, and that Glenn would more than likely have had the same prejudices as the others. However, to preserve his hero status, filmmakers/ screenwriters made sure to keep him on the 'good' side.Overall though, a very powerfully themed movie with great acting, music, and cinematography.",

            "content": "\"Hidden Figures\", directed by Theodore Malfi and based on the book of the same name, is a historical drama highlighting the struggles and accomplishments of three African American women who were employed by the NASA space program in the 1960s. The social backdrop of the narrative takes place early in the Kennedy administration, and Jim Crow laws and customs still dominated most of the United States\u2014even in (federal) government employment, discrimination was still the standard, as the Langley Virginia NASA campus had separate work facilities (and bathroom facilities) for white and black employers. Octavia Spencer is Dorothy Vaughan: she leads a team of numbers-crunchers who contribute to the math-heavy physics and engineering problems that NASA is trying to solve in order to compete with the Soviet Union in space exploration. Taraji Henson is Katherine Johnson, who gets a promotion of sorts to work with the all-white team under Kevin Costner's gruff but fair Al Harrison. She's a backup calculator to Jim Parson's Paul Stafford (a kind of vaguely less grating version of his Sheldon character on Big Bang Theory). Janelle Monae is Mary Jackson, who pines for an engineer's role, but finds herself stymied by the racism of administrators who seemingly invent new hoops for her to jump through.An intriguing subplot involves an early-generation IBM computer being installed on the campus: back then, a mechanical computer literally took up an entire room\u2014but once installed, no one seems to know what to do with it\u2014which Dorothy takes as her cue to learn Fortran and teach it to her charges. All the ladies have children, and are churchgoers. The film wisely shows the family interactions, and the warm relationships therein, in stark contrast to the predominately white work environment at NASA, where condescending managers take their black workers for granted. The film eschews any outright vicious depictions of racial confrontations and the oppression of the era. A police encounter is treated with comic effect, as is one of the ladies browsing in the \"White\" area of a library. The \"n-word\" is never used by anyone. Most of the adversaries aren't broadly drawn. The most tension in the film is reflected in a compelling monologue by Henson when her character is confronted about her lengthy bathroom breaks. Overall, this is a feel good movie, and gives due respect to a trio of Americans who contributed greatly to the sciences and who were . Astronauts like John Glenn (here played by Glen Powell) got to be the face of NASA to most of the public and the world. There were legitimately hundreds of employees of other kinds whose work was unheralded\u2014but due in great part to the racial discrimination of the era they survived in, \"erasure\" threatened to marginalize the accomplishments of Katherine, Mary and Dorothy. \"Hidden Figures\" makes sure that no one forgets their names again.",

If initial statistics bear out, Hidden Figures will be quite a gender polarizing movie with females have a definitely greater appreciation of the movie than men. Whether or not there is any racial differences remain to be scene. This generally popular and some might say political correct black and white discriminatory period film reveals how black females in particular were minimized and isolated from the main society. The black man and white race, except the lead Kevin Costner relegated most of the other characters to minor or fumbling roles. However, unlike the more edgy and searing contemporary, anti-discrimination film Crash (2004) or intimate portrait of black labor of the 60s in The Help (2011), Hidden Figures is able to capture a connection with a wider public audience.Hidden Figures for some reflects supposedly a different era of American history that a majority of Americans might not really relate to, something that might only be suggested today, though with the Black Lives movement and the increasing racial divide in our country today, Hidden Figures may be more relevant now than might have been otherwise. Hidden Figures may stand out from even The Paperboy (2014) for its ability to directly connect the common part in which race did not factor into the Patriotic, nationalistic pride and focus of this Country's unity with its important space program. Except perhaps a too brief and even unnecessary prelude of the childhood of one of the main characters, Hidden Figures has great editing, tender and insightful moments that reveal the darker places of America's relatively recent past.",

This film has low budgets but kick butt with other higher profile picture for the Oscars they are the rocky of the awards season under dogs with a big heart The best movies show us our shared connections., Hidden Figures absolutely does. The film tells the story of three African-American women who were chasing a police car as an escort after the women car had a broken down. who are experts in Stem (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths). We see so few women on screen working in these fields, and even fewer who are African American. And the fact that this is a true story, yet one most are unfamiliar with, is disgraceful. We've been deprived this amazing story about women of colour for too long. But the movie doesn't dwell on the fact that history has ignored these women's invaluable contributions. Through Hidden Figures' emotions, wonderful acting and joy we become a part of the story and are taken on a ride with these women that culminates in one of the greatest feats of humanity: a person going into space. What Hidden Figures teaches us is that man made it to space thanks to the calculations of an incredibly brilliant African-American woman. With its box office success, Hidden Figures has proved that audiences are hungry for these types of stories, and just like with the Russians getting into space just before Alan shephard did their trials NASA found untapped talent in a group of African-American female mathematicians that served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in U.S. history. Based on the unbelievably true life stories of three of these women, known as \"human computers\", we follow these women as they quickly rose the ranks of NASA alongside many of history's greatest minds specifically tasked with calculating the momentous launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, and guaranteeing his safe return. Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Johnson crossed all gender, race, and professional lines while their brilliance and desire to dream big, beyond anything ever accomplished before by the human race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true American heroes Kevin Costner character was AL Harrison who was trying to get a these numbers and make sure the rockets and people got back so with taraaji p Henson playing the brain-box with memory for numbers but people who kept putting her back because her reports go through AL assistant Paul Stafford played by Jim parson who character was over whelmed by how much the accuracy of the GPS coordinated were by the Katherine and with the help of her friends they won over the colou divide and a mile and a half toilet situation and with a mini budget of 25 mill it has made 146 mill and counting this one will give la la land a run for its money and with the help of NASA archive it gives historic accuracy to the unknown women behind the science this 2hrs 7mins I gave a worthy 10 out of 10 it might win for best actress and best editing you couldn't get a true story great acting all around here kevin Costner deserved an award here for pushing the boundaries",

Today we talk about discrimination against women, though this film is an example that it all had started way long ago, yet the struggle has not ended. Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA.The film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed.The others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon. I hope they would consider it! Seems a nice idea!8/10",

As per 'St. Vincent', Melfi blends comedy and drama together to tell his tale, though this is a more sobering affair with several scenes that highlight how prevalent racial prejudice was back then. Unfortunately, most of the best moments dealing with this made in into the film's theatrical trailer, and while there is something curious in how NASA has to overcome backwards prejudices to advance forward in the space race, it is hard not to wish for the film to focus more on the space race and less on racism. The film additionally feels rather unbalanced by giving Taraji P. Henson twice as much screen time as both her co-stars. Henson admittedly has the best character and delivers the most rounded performance, but the achievements of her peers are diminished by making her such a prominent figure. And yet, if hardly the most amazing true-story drama of recent time, the film is very watchable throughout thanks to solid performances by all concerned and an excellent mix of music with input from Pharrell Williams. Sure, the music is not true to the era but it adds a lot of bounce to what is otherwise fairly routine stuff as far as feel-good biographical dramas go.",

The early jump-forward-in-time clunky scenes of their car broken down along a highway, and then driving just a few feet behind a speeding police car were curiously poor choices; and the early scenes setting up the overt discrimination that existed at that time were mechanically sledge-hammered into the story line - for any in the audience who never heard about it or forgot about it (?). A more cohesive screenplay for the fist portion of the film would have earned it a 10. Fortunately the story telling gets better and the lives of these three very bright and important women begins to be told. The central and inspirational theme of this film is that in the face of not only racial discrimination but being female as well, each took pro-active, productive steps to self-improve their standing in life. One taught herself Fortran computer language from a book; another petitioned and won the court's approval; and another used her training, skill and persistence to become an important part of the success of early NASA space flight. Rather than doing nothing and demanding respect, they got busy and EARNED it. A timeless real-life example and message for people of any race or gender.The real-life pictures and life updates as the credits rolled at the end of the film were the icing on the cake.P.S.

            "content": "Review: What an amazing true story, which I found quite shocking, and entertaining at the same time. I can't believe that there was a group black ladies, known as the \"human computers\", working for Nasa, and that they were responsible for some of the most important missions of all time. The fact that there story has never been told, is what I found quite shocking, and there unique mathematical skills were truly remarkable. During racial times, and with there gender against them, Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae), swiftly move up the ranks in different departments at Nasa. With the Russians being the first to put a man on the moon, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), is under a lot of pressure to complete a successful launch into space but all of there missions have failed because they haven't been able to put together the numbers correctly. Katherine is promoted to try and help to sort out there formulas but it takes some time for her to be taken seriously, as she is the only black woman in that department. Mary Jackson is also promoted but she really wants to be an engineer, which is unheard of for a black woman in Nasa. After reading the rules for becoming an engineer, she decides to attend night school so she can apply for the job. Dorothy Vaughan battles to get a promotion in her job, even though she plays more of an supervisor type role, and when the new IBM computer arrives at Nasa, she makes it her goal to teach the women how to use it, knowing that she might finally get the promotion that she deserves. With there determination, and there brilliant skills, these 3 African American women manage to achieve there goals, with the odds stacked up against them. That's what made this inspirational story so great, because they were all treated with disrespect, because of there race and gender but they played a huge part into getting an astronaut into space. The acting from the whole cast, was spot on and the whole look and feel of the film, made it emotional and very believable. I would have liked to have seen how the ladies progressed in time but apart from that, it's a great watch and it was good to see something great come out of a bad situation. Great Watch! Round-Up: With such a small budget, and an amazing profit at the box office, director Theodore Melfi done a great job with such an remarkable story. He also directed St. Vincent, starring Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy, back in 2014, so with only 1 project in his filmography, the studio took a gamble with this director, which definitely paid off. With Pharrell Williams in the producers chair, who supplied a great soundtrack throughout the movie, and 3 Oscar nominations, I'm just glad that this movie got the respect that it truly deserved.Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $230.7millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/history/dramas, starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali and Aldis Hodge. 8/10",

            "content": "Fifty-six years ago, the first Black women came to work at NASA, a milestone during a time that in a way appears similar to our modern- day culture. Maybe there are no more Jim Crow segregation laws, but we still see Civil Rights protests by angry citizens flaunting picket signs, gender discrimination in the workforce, and consistent scientific breakthroughs from widely respected corporations. You might believe me when I say how very little has changed since then, as we are ultimately guilty of repeating the same mistakes, which the newest biopic, Hidden Figures, subtly proves to us. \u200b It churns your stomach to remember the function of class relations in 1961: all colored people by law could only touch specially separated computers, bathrooms, and coffee stations labeled, \"colored.\" The police also had the privilege to escort a Negro out of the library for setting foot in the \"White\" section. Unbelievably, these rules to living were active not too long ago. Yet these circumstances allow the delivery of an uplifting true story about man's historical progression and future potential.Three ladies of color are seen beside a non-functioning car in the Virginia countryside. So who else would come to ruin their day other than a stubborn police officer? It looks like a deep pit of doom until they suddenly get the car functioning again, and successfully convince the officer to escort them to their jobs at NASA.One is sent to the other \"colored\" workers in a separate room from the rest of the campus, one is left to work in the testing facility where the other men bully her, and one gets the worst of it\u2014she spends day and night working behind a desk, ruthlessly mistreated by everybody else. Her incredible knowledge in analytical geometry makes little difference; she still gets deliberately discriminated by her coworkers, and has no other options other than to race half a mile across campus to the nearest \"colored\" bathroom whenever she needs to relieve herself.The cast and crew's hard work results in a loyal adaptation, both to the true story and to the Margot Lee Shetterly book it's based on. Educational facilities everywhere will benefit from its survey of the cultural influence on NASA during its early efforts of launching man into space. If that's not a landmark event in societal progression worth telling, then I don't know what is.Although beside the meticulous recreation of the Civil Rights era's segregation, the overall period setting offers nothing new to the cinematic experience. Director Theodore Melfi's direction brims in the epitome of generic: creating too squeaky-clean of an atmosphere in order to be the sole \"family-friendly\" Oscar buzz movie. The bright colors and made-for-television sets do not recreate the sickening feel of the era it attempts to establish. Although the period does get needed justice by showing a series of news footage from the time, the slightly-off-focus cinematography fails to craft the feel of immersion.The shifts in tone and character may feel a bit too sudden to produce any further realism in the environment, the overwhelmingly masculine society triggers a series of intriguing tests onto the three women. At home, one of them must act as both mommy and daddy to her three daughters, adding to her already boiling pressure. The challenges on and off the job never seem to quit, and the remarkable chemistry between the three leading ladies: Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, halt any dull moments. Henson particularly deserves special recognition in her portrayal of an independent woman we want to succeed; her transparent discomfort comes across as all the White workers stop and stare at the color of her skin.While a picture about the Civil Rights era probably didn't need to dwindle its content down to a profitable PG-rating, the job still triumphs based on the difficult subject the cast and crew had to handle. In light of recent memories we have succumbed to throughout 2016, all of us: man and woman, dark or light, millennial and baby boomer, ought to use a high quality feel-good drama to look toward a brighter 2017.",

            "content": "There's much to admire in Theodore Melfi's newest uplifting venture \"Hidden Figures.\" His ability to tap into the human condition and spirit has been proved with efforts like \"St. Vincent.\" Boasting an all-star cast that includes the talents of Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae and Octavia Spencer, the 20th Century Fox feature emerges as one of the feel good films of the holiday season. Just one year after #OscarSoWhite dominated the internet, pointing out the Academy's lack of diversity, the timely themes explored here resonate more than ever.\"Hidden Figures\" tells the story of a team of African-American women who provide NASA with important mathematical data needed to launch the program's first successful space missions.Melfi is a competent and distinguished filmmaker, and despite only two features under his belt, he really knows how to tell a story and tell it well. He invites the audience into the tale, allowing his sensibilities to take hold of the viewer. The top-notch direction in which he leads his actors are some of the finest of the year. Taraji P. Henson's Katherine Johnson, one of the brightest minds to ever walk through NASA, delivers her best film performance since \"Hustle & Flow.\" She is finally given an opportunity to play something different than her ever-popular Cookie from FOX's \"Empire.\" While she overplays her hand slightly in key moments, her natural charisma is on full display for the audience to behold.The professional and stoic presence of Octavia Spencer tends to be overlooked in film because she's always so great without even really trying. As Dorothy Vaughan, Spencer delivers some of her same ticks that won her an Academy Award for \"The Help\" and that could be too familiar for some on the surface. When seen on multiple viewings, you can see Spencer's interpretation of her character really evolve throughout the film's runtime.The highlights of \"Hidden Figures\" are in the two show-stopping performances of musical artist turned actress Janelle Monae and Academy Award winner Kevin Costner. Monae taps into the fight and spunk of Mary Jackson, showcasing the determination and frustration of a brilliant mind, desperate to finally explore her full academic and professional potential. While Monae's external beauty is front and center, she bares her soul to the viewer, virtually giving us a warm nuzzle and allowing us to get peeks into her sophisticated and heartbreaking aura.In recent years, Costner has found it difficult for audiences to remember how great of an actor he really is. We've received brief glimpses in films like \"The Upside of Anger,\" but rest assured, Costner magnifies his abilities here, likely delivering his finest performance yet. His Al Harrison's leadership is a comfort for the film, acting like cinematic scissors to cut through the barrier between movie and person.The film is a major threat for the Cast Ensemble award at the upcoming Screen Actors Guild awards, with supporting players like Mahershala Ali (charming as ever), Jim Parsons (playing an against- type), Kirsten Dunst (feverishly addictive in her mean woman role), and Glen Powell (playing the late John Glenn) all crucial to the film's inevitable success.Brimming and refreshing, Melfi's technical team truly shines with slick production and costume design, and a soundtrack that is sure to go down as one of the year's best. Producer and songwriter Pharrell Williams' two numbers \u2013 \"I See Victory\" and \"Runnin'\" \u2013 are just two more examples of the Original Song Oscar being the most competitive in the history of the category. In terms of the film itself, it does the job and does it well. Not necessarily pushing the boundaries of filmmaking, it's just pleasant and wonderful in every sense of the word.Precisely marketed as terrific adult entertainment for the Christmas season, \"Hidden Figures\" is a faithful and truly beautiful portrait of our country's consistent gloss over the racial tensions that have divided and continue to plague the fabric our existence. Lavishly engaging from start to finish, \"Hidden Figures\" may be able to catch the most inopportune movie-goer off guard and cause them to fall for its undeniable and classic storytelling. The film is not to be missed.GRADE: (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd)",

This is a biographical drama starring three strong Afro-American women, who were employed to calculate the mathematical risks related to sending an astronaut into orbit. These women were either engineers or effectively human computers. Each were obviously being held back in their careers because of the institutional racism that existed at NASA at the time. Each of the women presented solid characters, who had their own individual challenges, but also had great collective chemistry. The film demonstrated racism, sexism and segregation themes while we see the girls very effectively overcome their diversity and maintain their dignity. It was interesting to notice how Kevin Costner's character was obviously blind to the racism around him at NASA until he is directly confronted with it, but we also see that he deals with the situations admirably. So in summary, this is an inspirational film which depicts a difficult time in history if you were a woman and especially black, and proves that women can do maths if they wear glasses.

No. Did Al Harrison really take a sledge hammer to the Colored Girls Restroom sign? No. Kevin Costner's character (and Jim Parson's for that matter) weren't real, they're composites. At times during this movie I felt I was being played, so I bought the book to see if it's as contrived as the movie. It's not. In documentary style it tells the very real stories of some extraordinarily talented black women, who managed to excel in spite of the racist southern culture they grew up in. Did Vaughn really teach herself how to program and operate the IBM 7090, a task that seemed beyond the ken of the white computer guys? Yes she did, but to be fair the men at NASA were not the dense drones portrayed in this and other scenes. I'd like to say that Katherine Johnson really did vent her frustration when explaining to some manager why her trips to the ladies room took so long, but she didn't. It was Mary Jackson however, who on one occasion suffered the giggles and humiliation of having to make that long walk. It would have been truer to life to learn that it was on that walk when she ran into an engineering manager who not only lent a sympathetic ear to her rant about the infuriating arrangements but who also took the opportunity to offer her a position that led to her getting the engineering position she deserved. Did John Glenn really ask for \"the girl\", meaning Katherine Johnson, to check the electronic computer's output in 1961? Yes he did, but it's even more impressive to know that for the Apollo moon landings that same girl also developed the equations to time the lunar module's launch window and engine burn time to rendezvous with the command module in orbit around the moon to take them back to Earth. I thought that the liberal Hollywood elite was going overboard in hitting us over the head with all the racism, but what gets revealed in the book shocked me. Imagine a school for black kids where the black teachers and principal get paid less than the white janitor, or Prince Edward County in Virginia which defunded its entire public school system in 1959 rather than integrate it. The state provided tuition grants for white students to attend white-only private academies but the parents of black kids were left to fend for themselves. They did what they could but education just ceased for many of those kids. Virginia got away with this for five years until the Supreme Court finally struck it down in 1964. So when Kirsten Dunst's character drawls, \"Despite what you may think, I have nothing against y'all,\" it's an understatement when Octavia Spencer shoots back, \"I know you probably believe that.\"",

It's a nice story and a strong moral, if a bit on the safe side. Nothing seems terribly difficult for these women, whether it's theoretical physics or racial equality, which reduces the power of their eventual success. One early scene epitomizes this attitude: broken down on the side of the road, they're approached by a stereotypical southern white policeman. Though internally panicked, they proudly stand their ground and deflect his barbs, and moments later he's giving them a friendly escort to the workplace. Faced with any degree of adversity, they merely hunker down, redouble their efforts and glide to victory. Which is admirable, and possibly truthful, if not especially gripping. The acting is good - Taraji P. Henson is most memorable as a mousey mother of three whose sole public outburst provides the film's only major dash of flavor - but the plot is too interested in lobbing softballs when it could've been pitching something with teeth. A warm, simple tale, appropriate viewing for a Sunday night with the family if not for challenging conventions.",

It's touching, funny, inspirational, infuriating and always captivating.Hidden Figures is the true story of three African American women who worked as \"computers\" in the US space program, and who overcame significant racist and sexist prejudices to succeed and advance in the predominately white male space program. (\"Computers\" were human mathematicians employed before the advent of electronic computers. The Space Task Force \u2013 a predecessor to NASA \u2013 was segregated, and \"colored computers\" worked separately from their white counterparts who were treated much better in terms of job opportunities, offices, restrooms, etc., etc.)The entire cast is excellent. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e play the three \"colored computers\" and the movie intertwines their professional and person lives with the early days of the Mercury space program. Kevin Costner plays Kevin Costner playing the head of the Space Task Force. (No one captures the 60s sensibility better than Costner) while Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons play obliviously racist administrators.The movie does an excellent job of recreating the look and feel of the 60s, and appears to have been faithful to the true story of the three women mathematicians. (One glaring error is that Mission Control during John Glenn's flight seems to have moved to Langley, VA.) The space program facilities feel authentic even though the movie was shot entirely in Georgia.If you like the topic, the space program, movies, the 60s, or just about anything else, see it now.",

Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae portray three women who work in NASA, fighting not just racism but sexism. Their weapons of choice in their struggles: their brains and perseverance.At the start of the movie, the Soviets are beating the U.S. in the race to get a man into outer space. NASA is in full swing, needing as many human \"calculators\" as possible since the IBM computers have not been set up yet. The most intelligent women of the black section of NASA are called in to the front lines to help with calculations and problem solving; and Henson, Spencer, and Monae all rise to the challenge to help put the first American into space and safely get him back to Earth.My most memorable, movie moment of \"Hidden Figures\" is the scene when Henson flips out on the all white group she works with regarding her ordeal with having to use the segregated bathrooms half a mile away from her workstation, plus not being able to use the same coffee pot her counterparts are using. All her work and effort and help\u0085and she is still treated as an inferior human. This scene was so intense it woke me up and got my adrenaline rushing (it was about 3 a.m. in the morning when this scene came on).\"Hidden Figures\" \u2014 a title that can be interpreted in two ways: black women who were part of the almost all white workforce of NASA; and the math that needs to be developed for further space travel \u2014 is a great movie that shows not only the struggles of blacks, but of women, in a world dominated by white men. Balancing this out are white, male characters that are open-minded and want only the best on the job, regardless of color or sex. Tempering the drama are the many comedic moments in \"Hidden Figures,\" most of which are charming and a few are laugh out loud funny.

And how those women managed to fight and prevail in the system, hence changing it for the better.The movie in itself, how the story is told, is pretty ordinary.

It is the story itself, the history in it, and the strength in the characters that make the movie really good.But it also depressing and frustration experience. Frustrating that these woman had to fight for something that they honestly shouldn't have to fight for.

            "content": "After 2016's debacle of lack of diversity at the Oscars, the Academy Awards had three black-themed movies in contention for Best Picture in 2017. One of them being the heavily talked about \"Hidden Figures\" based off of a novel by Margot Lee Shetterly titled \"Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race\".The first impression of watching writer-director Theodore Melfi's adaptation had me crying tears of joy and opened up new perspective of NASA's early days to a story I never heard of before. After the second viewing, the emotions stayed the same. The triumphant story dealt with issues that NASA had to overcome at a time when segregation was running rampant and how three African-American women overcame these prejudices and proved worthy contributors who helped send the astronauts into space seven years later.Taraji P. Henson stars as Katherine Gobel Johnson a mathematician who's also a widow who's also raising her three daughters on her own. She emerged from obscurity as a child, aced it in college and the proverbial passing of the chalk to Johnson would be symbolic to the magic of what she can do with it. She also remain celibate after her husband's death.Next we have Dorothy Vaughan (Best Supporting Actress Nominee Octavia Spencer) a mathematician who's mentoring fellow black students into her field of study emanating from her basement without acknowledgement or pay. When asked for recognition from hard-nosed blonde Vivian (Kirsten Dunst) it is accomplished by way of resistance. Then you have Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) who's engineering mastery is met with great approval from her professor who was a Jewish Holocaust survivor. However, she must overcome her obstacles by attending an all-white high-school and to enroll in an Ivy League College. The other burden was to seek approval from her activist husband Levi (Aldis Hodge) who is discourages her to go either for her safety or the fear of her upstaging his deflated ego.The trifecta will have throughout the course of the film will have to overcome racism and sexism in their quest for recognition. Even in smaller scenes when the white cop pulls over the ladies after their car breaks down as he's taken aback when he finds out they work for NASA. Or when Katherine's suitor Col. Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali) is stunned about her line of work.Surely this film deserves all the credentials it got come award season, there are moments where the story becomes too saccharine, sweet and surreal at times. Katherine is taken under the guidance of chief programmer Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) ans sides her up with mathematician genius Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons). Stafford's massive ego refuses to gibe any credits to anyone much less a black woman. Katherine is alienated to the fact being the only black woman working for Harrison. In her work, she's appalled when she gets her coffee under the one labeled coloured. When going for a bathroom break she disappears for 30 minutes because there's no stall for coloured. Sure Harrison is a great supervisor, but still he couldn't possibly turn a blind eye on the coloured pot or her absence for days or weeks. It took Katherine's outrage to get Harrison's attention to his workers that here at NASA we're all the same race.Is it irony or what, but why in the midst of controversy is this movie being released slightly after the Presidential elections? Is it because Trump's election win was supported by the Russian hacking into the Democratic party's web pages which led to one of Trump's national security advisers to resign when confronting a Russian ambassador.What a coincidence that the United States was facing off with Russia even back then during the long-running Cold War as they competed with each other to see who'll be the first to land on the moon, but it wouldn't have been possible for these three hidden figures.",

Surprising as it may be NASA has a hidden story. Hidden Figures sets that story for the big screen, set in Virginia, 1961 a time when people never expected women to amount to anything, especially women of colour who were still used for help around houses in that time, this well-crafted film sets the tale of how a trio of African-American boffins changed the face of not just America but NASA too. We open with Katherine Johnson (Henson) as a child and how she succeeded as a mathematician, it's not much of an origin story but it's well-crafted nonetheless. Then the film shifts to when she is grown up surrounded by her two best friends Dorothy (Spencer) a computer programmer and Mary (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) an engineer these three have a dream to change the world, but when they get to their destination at NASA they are bombarded by racism, sexism, that doesn't stop them from achieving their dream. Writer/director Theodore Melfi makes us wait a while for these women to achieve big however he uses this time well, crafting these women to become big historic figures takes time, Katherine is a brilliant mathematician when she is assigned to another part of the building it is her job to look up some numbers, there is one member of her new team who doesn't like her straightaway, but she is determined to show these men exactly what she can do. Granted she may be the subject of bullying at her job but she is strong-willed and doesn't let these bullies get the best of her. But not only is she a hard-worker, she's also a mother having to take care of her three children after the death of her husband. She's shy of meeting a new man until she meets the one of her dreams, who changes her life for the better. Until, the building decides to bring in faster super-computers she starts to feel scared about her job so she is keen to keep her job going until the computers start to work. This is when we see what soft-talking Dorothy can do when she starts to work her magic on the computers. At this point Mary finds out that she can't be an engineer without any specific qualifications she flips out and decides to go back to school. In the third act when their lives start to get better, suddenly the computers start to work so Katherine is not needed any more, this is when the film loses its momentum it spends a lot of time trying to get it back by coming with various equations for the Earth landing which need to be confirmed, it struggles to get the momentum back. Granted the story loses its momentum, but Hidden Figures hits almost every beat with perfect execution, it's an empowering story of inspirational women who changed the world of space travel forever; it has a lot of detail, a lot of technical speech it's very funny in places, there is plenty here to enjoy and is just a another addition to the already huge list of inspirational stories.VERDICT: A warmhearted, witty and truly inspirational story. Hidden Figures hits many beats big or small with almost perfect execution that propels the film forward with non-stop motion.",

It was a very impactful film that depicted a glorious feat in American history during an inglorious period in American history.This film is great in depicting this struggle of African-Americans during this time period in which there were these indifferences in the ways that they were treated, it is about how these women stood up for themselves and made a difference rather than put up with such prejudices. This film thrives the most at doing things very simply and down to earth, no big moments were necessary, it was just a steady telling of this story which fitted very well with the plot of the film. This is probably the most down to earth space film out there.Another field in which makes Hidden figures so great is its excellent cast, every single cast member played so brilliantly. The transformation that Taraji P. Henson underwent in terms of her posture and approach were done so well to fit into the character of Katherine G. Johnson. Compared to some of her other roles you could very clearly see a distinct difference/transformation. From her semi-awkward speech to her constantly pushing up her glasses, all of these attention to detail make this a fantastic performance. The two female supporting casts, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae were great also. It was also quite hilarious seeing Jim Persons essentially playing his role of Sheldon Cooper here along sides Taraji P. Henson. Overall I believe the the film does a good job depicting this story and the fact that these are figures that many Americans never read about in the history books it really is true to the title of \"Hidden figures\". This surprising detail makes the events of the story all the more important and impactful to modern day audiences as they get to unravel and understand many 'hidden figures' that contributed so much to the United States and were such an important part of American history.",

With stiff competition between Russia and the thought of coming in second place in a two-way race, the need for success was palpable. We have seen movies following the journey of astronauts and the science wizards at NASA, but who would have guessed that even as man was shooting for the stars, employees at the head offices still had to use \"colored\" and \"white\" bathrooms?Theodore Melfi directs this picture which has the feel-good attitude of \"The Help,\" a movie that was a box-office success and sugarcoated race relations in the 1960's. Heck, even Octavia Spencer appears in both films. I can't say for sure which film succeeds more at its objective. The story of black female mathematicians surely isn't one that many people had heard of, and perhaps that's where the film's title is rooted (although I would wager that \"Hidden Figures\" is one of the year's worst titles...). It's a good story rooted in strong performances, but I found the overall result to be a wash of clich\u00e9s and predictability.Three friends - Katherine, Dorothy, and Mary (Taraji Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae respectively) carpool together to the offices of NASA where John Glenn is about to launch into space to become the first American to circle the globe via spaceship. How they are friends we are not sure, but their quick wits and strong minds surely bind them together. Our central character is Katherine, who is called in to assist with the top engineers on flight reentries and landings. Not only is she the only black woman working on these most important calculations, but she is the only woman aside from a secretary who watches her with distain. She reports to Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), built up to be a firm disciplinarian but develops into a man who only wants to see the job done, regardless of race or sex. At NASA, we learn that most of the black mathematicians work in a 'holding room' of sorts, arriving each morning and assigned as 'computers' on various tasks that could result in a couple hours work or a couple weeks... It's all based on assignment. Though they are all employed, the possibility of work is not always guaranteed.Like \"Apollo 13\" did so brilliantly, suspense is built during moments when we know the outcome. Even though we know John Glenn makes it back to earth safely (and only just passed away this year), there are nail-biting moments of drama when the fate of success rests on a pencil, paper, and brains. Mary (Janelle Monae in the film's best performance) is assigned to work on the capsule and heat shield. Though she excels at math, she dreams of becoming an engineer (unheard of at the time. She became the first black female engineer in NASA history as the end credits tell us). She takes no slack and acts as any man in her position would: she is straight-forward and doesn't shy away from confrontation. Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) only wants to become a Supervisor and get an according pay raise, and along the way discovers her knack for computers and electronic programming.I admire the film and it's message, but even yet we suffer from clich\u00e9. Whether or not Katherine Johnson was called in within 10 seconds of launch to recalculate a landing formula is beside the point. There are moments in this film where I found myself saying \"I've seen this before\" and \"I bet I know what will happen next.\" Ten times out of ten I was right. This isn't to discredit the stories of the real women, but rather dismiss the screenwriter for falling prey to conventionality. I highly doubt Dorothy Vaughan was able to sneak into the massive IBM Computer Room and reprogram the machine for weeks without being caught. I doubt the engineers at NASA were really so dumb as to put astronauts' lives at risk until the their math was proved wrong by the film's hero. For a film, it's exhilarating entertainment. Considering the real-life story was almost guaranteed to be less dramatic, we can cut our losses.I should expect Janelle Monae and perhaps Octavia Spencer to reel in the award nominations for their dedicated and memorable roles. I would consider Taraji P Henson if not for one scene that screams \"I want an Oscar\" in which Katherine explodes about having to use a colored bathroom and face the scorn of her coworkers. Wide-eyed and full of rage, it's a powerful moment yet goes against everything we know this character to be. The film itself feels a lot like that: trying so hard to be an Oscar contender even by putting reality aside. There isn't a whole lot of depth given to these characters, and even less to the white engineers who essentially prove to be the villains (Jim Parsons gives a surprisingly monotone performance). For movies to touch on aspects of historical race relations, they must realize that it isn't all black and white.",

I keep hoping for one this good but they mostly just rehash old stuff and end up with a shiny new DUD! This one, however, was NOT a dud. It was a GO, all the way.The actors were believable, the writers were spot on and the director knew just the right pacing and insert shots to do to tell the story without being obvious.I never knew about these ladies and I was glued to the TV right with a few million other people for these baby-step space flights. The \"NASA team\" surely covered over a lot of individual contribution but this needed to come to light a long time ago. The day of the flight would not have been too soon.The racial angle was covered well, without being offensive. I remember going to J.C. Penney's on Texas St. in Shreveport and seeing two drinking fountains. I remember the blacks sitting at the back of the trolley cars. It seemed strange but that's the way it was then. These things were obviously pointed out but the viewer was not hit over the head with these facts.I feel this is a fair presentation of the facts and I add my congratulations to these women, especially, and the rest of the NASA workers for making a safe flight, multiple times over.You need to see this movie as soon as possible. I hate to gush, but it is that good! I hope to see more like this soon and stop being so bored with the current crop of movies. Oh, Oscar committee.... VOTE FOR THIS ONE!!",

            "content": "Frontrunner for my favorite film of the awards season, Hidden Figures contains heavy doses of irony that may not have been intentional at the time of production. Set during the transition to the 1960s, with skinny ties and Jim Crow laws, the zeitgeist of the cold war, and the pressure cooker of the U.S. space program after Sputnik, it was a time before electronic computing was commonplace. Unimaginably, the math for the orbital mechanics of the Mercury missions was being performed on slide rules, pencil, and paper. The revelation of this film is that some of the human \"computers\" that did this vital work were African American women, who despite their brilliant contributions, were segregated and marginalized because of their color and gender.Chalk up one for amazing timing\u0085 One cannot ignore that for these past few months, making America \"great again\" has, for an outspoken intolerant minority, meant reverting back to this white male-dominated social structure with all of its overt sexism and racism. In this light, seeing the inhumane treatment visited upon the hardworking heroes of this film moves beyond sepia-toned history and elicits real, contemporary rage.The superb cast is lead by Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer, who are exceptional and nomination worthy as real-life mathematician Katherine G. Johnson and supervisor Dorothy Vaughan. Mahershala Ali (Moonlight) is terrific as the socially awkward love interest Colonel Jim Johnson. Kirsten Dunst turns in a surprisingly solid performance as a hardened by-the-book supervisor, and Kevin Costner thankfully melts believably into his role as chief of the space program. Jim Parsons' portrayal of an overtly racist engineer is sadly wooden, and is the only weak spot in an otherwise strong ensemble.Theodore Melfi's film is definitely a glossy Hollywood telling, and effectively pulls at the heart strings with every element, but the work does not descend too frequently into unnecessary sentimentality. Scenes of the heroines' home lives feel sweet but not overly romanticized, and scenes of their hardships are more matter-of-course than melodramatic. The film is beautifully lensed by Mandy Walker, and has a wonderful kinetic energy. This is robust, big studio filmmaking certainly, but it has at its center memorable real heroes, an inspiring story, and great heart.Highly recommended! Go, and take the kids.",

Dorothy was Not as smart as they made it seem. For example she was NOT a computer engineer and could NOT fix the computer only the EXTREMELY smart IBM engineer could do that. One major problem is this is a movie about the space programs and to little about space. It does however have some redeeming features and can be inspirational at times. It does skim the surface of the issues of segregation in the 50's and 60's, and shows what hard work can achieve. Everyone regardless of color, or status, should take inspiration in what can be achieved by getting out of the socialist enslavement of the social programs Dr King feared so much, staying in school, working hard, the sky is the limit, even the moon!

            "content": "I often jokingly refer to my job as being a \"rocket scientist.\" While it does involve rockets and space, it isn't nearly as \"down in the numbers\" as the jobs portrayed in this film were. I've worked with a lot of people over the years in this technical field, and my opinion has always been that, if somebody is competent enough to do the job, we should hire the most competent people to do said job. Even though this is a statement against nepotism and just knowing the right people in the right places, what this film has shown me is that it's not nearly that simple.In terms of competency, I will not judge you by your gender or your race, as long as you show you can do the work and not be a burden on the team. However, even though people are highly qualified, they have had the deck stacked against them from the very start. What Hidden Figures reveals is the barriers to even be considered for a job, even if the competence is there. These three women all had incredible talent, but the mere bureaucracy put in place to prevent them from succeeding was appalling. Not only do I feel we should be judged by the competence of our work, but I also feel everyone should be given the same opportunities to prove they can do said work.Even despite these barriers, these three women stood up against the system put in place against them. From challenging the law in order to attend needed classes to stealing a book from the library to get a jump start on \"the next big thing,\" I can only hope that these barriers do not exist today in part due to their exemplary efforts. The actual space program felt ancillary to these stories, which was probably why its part of the film didn't have the same emotional impact that it did in films like The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995). Still, the humor and levity present throughout this film perhaps made the racism and sexism just a little less impactful, even if it made the film overall more enjoyable (and not a browbeater).A fantastic film about the lesser-known geniuses of the NASA space program, I give Hidden Figures 4.0 stars out of 5.",

Henson. In Hidden Figures an uplifting true-life drama about the African-American women who played a key role in US space missions. It's 1962 and the space race is on. NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is determined to beat the Russians in putting a man into orbit around the Earth. But behind the scenes, a trio of pioneering African-American women are responsible for the calculations that will launch John Glenn (American actor Glen Powell - The Expendables 3, Ride Along 2) into space. These \"human computers\" have to battle against deeply engrained racism and sexism to secure their place in history. Katherine G. Johnson (American actress Taraji P. Henson - The Karate Kid 2010, Date Night) is a brilliant maths prodigy. Team supervisor Dorothy Vaughn (American actress Octavia Spencer - Get On Up: The James Brown Story, Divergent films) is kept in her place by a condescending boss Mrs Vivian Mitchell (American actress Kirsten Dunst - Spider-Man films, Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles). And Mary Jackson (American actress Janelle Mon\u00e1e - Moonlight) endures an uphill struggle to train as NASA's first black female engineer. From the director of 'St. Vincent', this is an inspirational, feelgood true story of unsung heroes who dared to dream big and refused to be intimidated by the obstacles placed in their way. Amongst the other actors / actresses in Hidden Figures include American actor Kevin Costner (Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, The Untouchables) as Al Harrison who works at NASA, American actor Jim Parsons (US TV Series The Big Bang Theory, Garden State) as Paul Stafford who works at NASA, American actor Mahershala Ali (The Place Beyond The Pines, The Hunger Games films) as Colonel Jim Johnson, American actor Aldis Hodge (Die Hard films, Straight Outta Compton) as Levi Jackson, Kimberly Quinn (St. Vincent, A Little Game and who is married to the director of Hidden Figures Theodore Melfi in real life) as Ruth Al's PA at NASA, Polish actor Olek Krupa (Thirteen Days, Eraser) as Karl Zielinski, American actor Kurt Krause (Devil's Due, The Last Of Robin Hood) as Sam Turner who works as NASA, Ken Strunk (Take Shelter, Promised Land) as Jim Webb, Lidya Jewett as Young Katherine Coleman, American actress Donna Biscoe (Red All Over, The Sacrament) as Mrs. Joylette Coleman, Ariana Neal (Get Hard, Fruitvale Station) as Joylette Johnson, Saniyya Sidney (Fences) as Constance Johnson, Zani Jones Mbayise (How To Be Single) as Kathy Johnson, American actor Tre Stokes as Levi Jr., Selah Kimbro Jones as Carolyn Marie Jackson, Corey Mendell Parker (Dead Still, Forbidden Attraction) as Howard Vaughan, Ashton Tyler as Leonard Vaughan, American actor Alkoya Brunson (The Birth Of A Nation, Vacation) as Kenneth Vaughan, Karan Kendrick (The Hunger Games, Parental Guidance) as Younger Joylette Coleman, Jaiden Kaine (US TV Series Luke Cage, Mr. Right) as Joshua Coleman, American actor Gregory Alan Williams (Terminator Genisys, In The Line Of Fire) as Marion Smithson, Maria Howell (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Mississippi Damned) as Ms. Sumner, Arnell Powell (Hindsight, The Honeymooners) as Professor Graves, American actress Crystal Lee Brown as Bernie, German actor Tequilla Whitfield as Eleanor, American actor Dane Davenport (The Birth Of A Nation, Flight) as Alan Shepard, Evan Holtzman (Dominion) as Deke Slayton, Travis Smith (The Good Lie, Shotgun Stories) as Scott Carpenter, American actor Scott Michael Morgan (The Descendants, Lovesick) as Bill Calhoun, Robert McKay (Brilliant Mistakes, Three Long Years) as Pastor Ayres, American actor Wilbur Fitzgerald (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, The Founder) as Senator Patrick and Joe Hardy Jr. (Mystic Rising, Zombie Tag) as Gordon Cooper. Filming locations in Hidden Figures include US States like West Virginia and Virginia but according to the IMDb website Hidden Figures was filmed in the US State of Georgia. Overall Hidden Figures is a good drama film filled with drama, science, space, astranauts, NASA employees, space shuttles, white and black people working at NASA, discrimination and racism in the work place, team work, togetherness, loyalty, a good insight in to the good work that the three African-American women mathematicians did good work at NASA back in the 1960's, breaking down barriers, old footage of the things that happened, maths sums, formulas, graphs, diagrams, family, genius people, outstanding performances from all the main actors / actresses and many other things throughout the film. So I will give Hidden Figures an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say Hidden Figures is worth seeing if you like drama films based on true stories or about NASA like Apollo 13, The Martian, Space Cowboys amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Hidden Figures in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",

I'd say these types of biopics are necessary as awareness for people who have contributed so much in the past and shaped our lives in a better way. The film is about three black women who try to overcome segregation and unequal work rights in the workplace. One of these women (a mathematician), calculates the trajectory for Project Mercury and the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the Moon.This film is one that's built on its performances, especially a typically strong one from Taraji P. Henson. She's almost always great in her roles. Hidden Figures required to be a sort of mousy, quiet worker. However, the prejudice against her because of her race/gender get to her and then she becomes impassioned. Katherine Goble Johnson (who is played by Henson) is a brilliant person and is able to snide it in a few situations to people who doubted her. I also liked Janelle Monae in this and hope to see her in more in the future.As I stated earlier this is a story that not many people know about. I know of John Glenn and his accomplishments but not of the women behind what he did. The film is powerful in the fact that it shows how unexpected people can be responsible for great things. The film also carries a message of moving on from segregation and moving towards something great (as a result of being united). The messages are very important and the film is very safe in its exploration of discrimination, which should please general moviegoers.I wasn't a big fan of Theodore Melfi's St. Vincent. The film had a remarkable performance from Bill Murray but really failed to be memorable as a whole. With Hidden Figures I think there is an improvement in presenting a story and staying in a successful storytelling structure. Its a pleasant film that does not do a whole lot wrong.7/10",

Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson with mathematical sweetness, giving every detail, nuance, fact, the visibility necessary to make us learn that the right to count is the representation of man's race. On the Moon, but from the point of view of those who have never gone beyond the stratosphere; from the perspective of those who have remained anchored on a land that they could not even feel their own, in a segregationist country like America in the 1960s (and today).Based on the book Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race by Margot Lee Shetterly, it is the story of a race for progress and emancipation.At school they teach us the name of those who first set foot on the Moon and perhaps the names of those who assisted the mission, but no one has ever given importance to human calculators, or those women who carried out the task now performed by modern technologies ; who worked in oblivion, detached from the rest of the NASA staff, earning lower salaries because they were women and because they were black.The focus is on the figure of African-American mathematics, scientist and physicist Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), of her immense talent in mathematical art, which in filmic representation acquires a real personification, bordering on art.But the beauty of Katherine Johnson's character is that it transcends her story - that of a very gifted child who is directed to do more by the teachers themselves - to escape beyond the boundaries of self-centeredness and selfishness.So, despite having a hypothetical bull's-eye fixed on Katherine, her aura would be meager without the support of Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e (Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson, respectively). Three women so different and yet so similar to each other.The former was a bit clumsy, sweet and shy; volcanic and resolute the second and attractive and tongue-tied the third. Women very different from each other in ways of doing and being, but all united by the determination and willpower that leads them to be protagonists and to have \"the knife on the side of the handle\" in a situation in which they would have been forced to be the last ones on the list.

            "content": "Let's get out of the way the main bugbear: Hidden Figures does try to make the \"struggle\" more real than it was. I don't blame them, it makes for a good story and while in theory, this film doesn't need to add inaccuracies, it would otherwise be hard to include how radical this was at the time. So, i found Hidden Figures to be a really good film. The main plot is about two, separate, black women who wind up working in the most important sectors of Project Mercury. They face difficulties due to the racial segregation in place at the time (although the film doesn't hammer on this, fortunately) and to their being women, all topped with some good ol' bureaucracy for extra difficulty. Through their intelligence and hard work, they manage to contribute significantly to the mission and mark a milestone in Aerospace flight, racial equality, and women's suffrage, all in one go.Taraji Henson, who plays Katherine, has the more interesting role; she \"fights The Man\" in key scene, and is the one who is has the most success. She has also some \"real life\" scenes which do not hurt the development of the film.Octavia Spencer, who plays Dorothy, has a smaller role, but she does a fantastic job with what little she has, often getting more out of a stare or some timid silence than most of the white cast. The overtly-beloved Jim Parson plays the same identical character as he does in Big Bang Theory because he isn't capable of doing otherwise.Kevin Costner dominates his role, which unfortunately, due to annoying things such as realism and historical accuracy, is too small for a massive actor such as him.The film does kind of drag on towards the end, and for some idiotic reason starts to play the \"victory sequence\" complete with heroic fanfare when the spacecraft finally completes its mission, while it's obviously clear to anyone in the audience, that the hero (Katherine) has already won, and is basically just doing a victory lap.I would wholeheartedly recommend Hidden Figures to just about everyone.The historical recreation is spot on, the direction is faultless, it has good pacing, good acting, the script is simplistic but yet agreeable, and it has something for everyone: it inspires, it invigorates, and it limits the amount of screen time that Parson gets.My vote: 8/10 - it does its job well.",

Johnson (played by the adorable Taraji P. Henson) was quirky and showed a lot of dedication. Dorothy Vaughan (played by Octavia Spencer) was simply amazing! She was sassy in a way done right! and of course my personal fav. the flirty Mary Jackson (played the beautiful Janelle Mon\u00e1e) put a smile on my face whenever she was on screen.The movie gets your attention from the opening scene (and it's a good one!) and once you're hooked your in for the long haul as it'll keep you interested from beginning to end. You are show the ugly face of segregation as a fact of life that these women don't fight but rather try to work around and how people can be cruel without even realizing it. I would recommend this to everyone, it was a lovely and (oddly enough given the subject it deals with) inspiring! an easy 10/10 and I'm glad a movie like this was made to shine the light on those that have worked so hard behind the curtain.",

            "content": "Reviews of Oscar contenders by Alex Deleon.HIDDEN FIGURES (A Sz\u00e1mol\u00e1s Joga) Hidden Figures is a very hard film to write an objective review about. You can't say anything bad about a film about good colored people (Afro-Americans) struggling against rabid racial prejudice and you can't say that this isn't really a Kevin Costner film with a few Afro-Americans supplying support in a thriller about getting a white guy (John Glenn) into space. Nor can you say that Kirsten Dunst isn't a lot easier on the eye than the pudgy bungling Afro-American lady who is theoretically the central figure (Tariji P. Henson) -- an extra smart mathematician who saves the day at NASA but keeps dropping things all over the place on her way to the segregated Colored Only toilet in a different building where she does most of her calculations in a John cubicle -- but basically, that's what it is. A Kevin Costner and Kirsten Dunst movie with a lot of colored people running around and some nice Cape Canaveral blast off and space orbiting footage.Very preachy with nearly every inspirational clich\u00e9 in the book but a definite winner given the pressure these days in Hollywood to promote demographic equality and not worry too much about intrinsic film quality. Costner's best work since The Untouchables. He should have been nominated for Best Actor. Kirsten Dunst was also very good in her relatively limited role. She's getting to be the go to good looking early middle age gal in Hollywood flixx. Improving with age like good wine. The best scene in the movie was Costner chopping down the Colored Only segregated bathroom sign with an axe and then muttering \"we only have one color at NASA\" over his shoulder as he strides away -- Good show Kevin!A non question not addressed in this \"Let's hear it for female Afro-American brain power\" inspirational polemic is; How come there were no white people around who could do Analytic Geometry at the time? -- And why didn't they apply for the job? Of course, this is a hair splitter of a moot question because if they did there wouldn't be any movie to talk about -- and since this is actual history (or something like that) you can't really knock it. Not that I would want to knock it ~ Some of my best friends used to be colored people. In high school.PS: The Hungarian title which translates as \"The right to calculate\" is quite apt since the main thrust of the story is about three black women fighting against rampant racial prejudice for the right to save the basically caucasoid Space program with their inborn calculational abilities. Amazing that this story has waited until now to be discovered and brought to light. If nothing else it will hold your interest for the meticulous reconstruction of the events of the early days of the Space Race when the Red Russians made American faces ruby red by getting a man into orbit -- Yuri Gagarin -- first.Incidentally, the guy who plays our first successful astronaut, John Glenn (who passed away December 8, 2016, at age 95) like a wannabe movie star deserves some kind of distinction for his upbeat portrayal of a genuine American hero. Hidden Figures is up for three Oscars: Best Picture, Best Supporting actress, (Octavia Spencer), Writing, Best Adapted screenplay (from a book). Bottom Line: Affimative Action in action in Hollywood..",

            "content": "In the arc of history you do not often see an underprivileged group shatter multiple glass ceilings. The incredibly brave women of Hidden Figures do exactly this. As African Americans, they shatter the barrier of entry to the hallowed halls of NASA, one of the crown jewels of the military industrial complex. As women they shatter the boys club of aerospace and rockets, where females were generally relegated to secretarial or clerical roles. Again as women, they shatter the upper echelons of scientific cliques, where many advanced subjects and challenges were deemed too difficult for females to undertake. This story needs to be told and retold.I literally cringed at the harsh treatment that these women faced in the bigoted time circa 1961. It seems the white establishment went out of their way to insult and humiliate their fellow African Americans, who showed amazing restraint and grace. It is quite alarming that a vast segment of America wants to return to this era, to put 'minorities in their place', but thankfully that clock will not be rolled back any time soon.It takes incredible courage to be the first, the pioneer and the vanguard, to pierce the veil of discrimination and shove your way into the room. The bravery of these women is exemplary and admirable through the ages. A must see movie to understand the cruelty of the past, and the possibilities born from courage and ambition. To me the historic space missions were a side story, the real subject was the journey of these strong, brave ladies of NASA.",

            "content": "At first, I thought this movie Hidden Figures was exaggerating the role of these three brilliant women. Why would I doubt? Because we live in a time where some play fast and loose with history...but my scan of other sources indicated the movie (in the most important ways) essentially is correct.I was told that despite the huge sizes of these 1960 era IBM computers. some electronic home sewing machines of today...have more computing power. And...the new IBM computers were not yet trusted, so it's true...Astronaut John Glenn asked one of the soon-to-be-obsolete human \"computers\" (Ms. Johnson) to hand calculate his launch trajectory to \"verify\" the machine computer. I'm wondering at the HIGH level of math it takes to do that!!!These 3 shrewd, smart women of color carved out positions for themselves. Young people could learn how to \"manage upwards\" from their techniques. All 3 worked hard, did fine work, researched and asked for new/better opportunities, and...did all the above with courtesy (most times). ***** \"Hidden Figures\" is a great family film for all but very little kids who might not understand it.NOTE: There was a real Cold War going on. Despite what some of you learned in school. Stalin's spies had stolen atomic bomb technology from the US sometime in the 1940s.Read up on how dangerous Stalin was...he outdid Hitler in numbers of persons who died in his camps (called \"gulags\").In the late 50s to early 1960s, Nikita Khrushchev was the next Soviet leader and had threatened that Communism would outlast Capitalism (mistranslated ...his son claims...as \"we will bury you\".) His shoe and fist pounding at the UN (which can be seen on YouTube) certainly did nothing to reassure the West that he was peaceful.And later...Khrushchev would be involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Nuclear warheads were in some of the US planes(and no doubt in some Soviet planes/missiles also). I knew a former fighterpilot, part of the US pilot group in the Cuban Missile Crisis, who confirmed \"I had a nuclear warhead in my plane.\" We came within inches of Nuclear War. So...you can better understand how the racist cop put aside his prejudice to help the black women get to their NASA jobs! The Soviet threat was real. And you can understand the ANXIETY of NASA leaders, as they sought to pull ahead of the Soviets.The Cold Warco uld have gone into \"Hot\" war at any time during this era, especially if the Soviets had gotten far ahead with satellites/missile delivery systems. The communist stated goal per Khrushchev and others, was world domination.Hidden Figures is a film suitable for home school kids from grade school on up. (There is a small scene where the three women drink alcohol...at home...but basically it's a PG film with no bedroom scenes and no violence.) **************************************************************PS...Next, I hope someone makes a film about another Hidden Figure --- the woman who did the groundbreaking DNA photography that Crick and Watson used to \"discover\" DNA. The woman who got left out of the Nobel prize...that Crick and Watson collected!",

That same sheen and humour does bring some fantastic \"Fuck yeah! You show em!\" moments though, one of which is cringeworthy, but will make you tingle. Make no mistake, it's powerful stuff and be warned you may not get through this without shedding a tear. It's enjoyable to watch the lead characters battle on regardless, headstrong, proud and more than capable than most around them. At the same time it's frustrating to see them have to work 10 times harder to get a fraction as far and even more so that over 50 years later, discrimination on race and gender is still around today.

            "content": "The Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union remains as one of the most fascinating events in human history, mainly due to the technological aspect of it all. As the title Hidden Figures suggests, there's much more to the whole story than just the technological aspect and I was unaware of it all.Hidden Figures tells the fascinating true story of a group of female African-American mathematicians, Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae), who played a major part in calculating vital data for NASA during the early years of the US space program.The feel-good factor of Hidden Figures is what makes it such an entertaining film, whether it be down to the performances or the screenplay, or even the music which features some original tracks by Pharrell Williams. The film focuses around the struggle three African-American women had in having their voices heard in a profession where the majority of workers were white males and the feel-good side of the film makes the film falter a bit in trying to get this struggle across. It's still quite hard to believe just how bad things were back then and I have to say the film feels a little guilty of glossing over these issues. With that in mind, the approach taken by Theodore Melfi makes for an infectious film that becomes incredibly hard to resist.The screenplay from Melfi and Allison Schroeder is one of the film's highlights, surprisingly funny and pacey enough to stop the film from dragging, serving both the inspirational story and the defiant characters incredibly well.Coming to the performances, Hidden Figures possesses a talented cast who all play their part in telling this story. Taraji P. Henson leads the main trio with a steely performance as Katherine Johnson, the woman with a brilliant calculator-like mind that helped NASA make giant leaps towards their goal. Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae complete the trio and they both deliver wonderful performances in such different ways. Spencer has been getting all the award nominations but I couldn't help but feel Monae deserved them more as she has one of the best scenes of the film. It sounds odd to say but Hidden Figures played out like an educational film for me as I had no idea about the behind the scenes of the Space Race. Hidden Figures can stand proud as an important and inspirational film that teaches you must decide who you want to be and never let anybody tell you any different.",

            "content": "First of all, I must say that it was a delight to see Kevin Costner after a long hiatus. He was amazing as always. However, Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson are women after my own heart. As a Black woman who attended two predominantly White institutions in the South. Alabama, to be exact, where people are still just as prejudice as they always were, and there has been very little progress in race relations. I still managed to graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Biology, a minor in Chemistry, and currently working on my Masters in Rural Community Health, and going for my PhD in Epidemiology. It was always my dream as a little girl to work for The CDC, The Pentagon, or NASA. This movie was phenomenal! It shows that despite having the cards stacked against you, it can be done. As an African-American woman with a love for science who is trying to make it in an industry predominantly run by White males, I was deeply moved by such an inspirational film. Black women are rarely shown in a positive light in film or in any other form of the \"entertainment\" industry for that matter, so it was really refreshing to see this.It does bother me that people always take whatever opportunity they can to compare feminism to racism when there is no comparison. I appreciate this movie for taking an honest approach to the situation, especially since being a woman only comes second to being a Black woman. Black is all people see first and foremost, so being a Black woman only makes it that much harder to get ahead. Above all else, at least White women have always had the color of their skin working in their favor, which is why I will never understand why this comparison is even a comparison at all. On top of that, people can call it racist propaganda all they like if it makes them feel better to bury their heads in the sand and pretend like these things never existed when in fact they did. We'll just pretend that the Black people made up the Jim Crow laws of the South to avoid offending people. I THINK NOT! Coming from someone who was born and raised in the heart of where the Civil Rights Movement took place, who's grandmother, Eva Lou Billingsley Russell, was a foot soldier in the movement. I can safely say there is no \"propaganda\" here!In many ways, that's the way it still is today, so these are not things of the past. I actually did a research project on the stereotypical representations of African-American women in contemporary television, although it was also from a reality television perspective, so I am fully aware of the hegemonic labels the media seems determined to keep circulating about Black women. They want us all depicted as mistresses to White men or portraying one of the many stereotypical labels placed on Black women. For example, the roles they want us to play always consist of being \"The Angry Black Woman,\" \"The Whore/Groupie,\" \"The Hood Girl,\" \"The Video Vixen,\" \"The Gold Digger,\" \"The Baby Mama,\" and \"The Bourgeois Woman.\" We are hardly ever shown as someone who is intelligent, ambitious, and classy. I can say this because these are only a fraction of the stereotypes, assumptions, and preconceived notions I face as an educated Black woman involved in an interracial relationship in the South.I appreciate a movie being made about how smart, talented, and educated Black women are. We are much more than the images that people put out about us. We are Mathematicians! We are Chemists! We are Engineers! We are Physicists! We are Doctors! We are Scientists!

            "content": "I have a split review. I'll start with the personal/human side of my viewing experience. 'Hidden Figures' does a brilliant job of compressing the story of the historic breaking of barriers by these three impressive, capable, brilliant and brave ladies of color. They deserved a 10-episode miniseries on HBO or Netflix but you still get the spirit of what they accomplished. The lead actresses were excellent, especially Taraji P. Henson as the math prodigy, Katherine G. Johnson. This movie is not a documentary and should not be viewed as such. This film is a vehicle to tell the story of Johnson, Vaughan, and Jackson. In just over two hours, 'Hidden Figures' hits all of the emotional notes perfectly without becoming maudlin or preachy. It is important to learn the personal stories of those who overcame the racism and sexism that dominated our society in the 1950s and early 60s. These women had to fight every step of the way to achieve what they were fully capable of doing and this film honors their legacy. Thankfully, the film doesn't fail to entertain and enlighten the audience. The narrative is powerful in showing the shocking ignorance and mean-spirited nature of living in a segregated society. We should also feel the frustration and disgust of knowing how much bigotry still exists in our society and the harm it continues to cause us all. We can feel the hope found in the progress made as long as we realize how far we have still yet to go on this journey. The side of me that is a historian of the space program was constantly jarred by the technical errors in showing the NASA side of the Mercury Program and the role of Langley. The temporal jumps also brought me out of the narrative. The clip of President Kennedy speaking about going to the moon were from his speech at Rice University in September of 1962 rather than from his address before a special joint session of Congress on May 25th, 1961. This is a key distinction because Shepard's suborbital Mercury flight was on May 5th which provided the basis of Kennedy's challenge. There were plenty of liberties taken with the facts and time line to give due diligence to the personal journey of these trailblazing African- American women. I estimate that 99% of the audience (or more) won't be bothered by the artistic license taken by the writers. So please see and enjoy this film.",

How refreshing to see Hidden Figures, a story of women who happen to be black reaching their potentials. The three main characters suffer double prejudice as both black and women. They are wives and mothers, the products of black families who fought to get them educated. The results helped put John Glenn in space. One of the daughters wrote the book. This is a story about more than three women. It's a success story that belongs to their families as well. I remember my father, who was an aerodynamical and thermodynamical engineer in this same era. He would come home and brag that he had reserved an hour with his companies IBM mainframe. Other Dads brought their sons toys and sweets. He'd bring me home those IBM punch cards. The movie got that part right. The advanced technology that was so amazing then is only fit for museums. We possess more calculating power in our cell phones than the entire NASA system that put a man in space. It was all done by people using math, engineers and mathematicians like these 3 amazing women.Like classic movies, Hidden Figures doesn't have any CGI. Not a shot is fired. Not a punch was thrown. It's simply a great story, well- researched with great characters. Props to everyone involved. If you have a collection of movies, this one is a keeper. Hidden Figures will still be a good movie long after we've forgotten flashier popcorn flicks. There's no substitute for a great script.",

I have had the privilege of going to NASA in Florida and yes, Apollo 13 does bring a tear to my eye. So when I saw the trailer for this movie being advertised it was a film I knew I had to see. The film is based on the true story of three brilliant black females who worked for NASA.The film follows their individual journeys in the company and demonstrates the challenges these young black women faced even though it has been 100 years since slavery was abolished. The movie challenges you into thinking about the impact that so many people have had in history who have been discriminated against for what ever reason. But what is more upsetting is that this film is set in the 60's which in reality wasn't that long ago and people were still being discriminated against. The effects in this film is brilliant. The story is gripping and compelling. The acting is second to none. Which begs the question why this film didn't succeed at the Oscars. The movie does transport you back to the time when NASA was loosing in the space race to the Russians and you can't help but feel that some of the issues that being portrayed then are actually still happening today. I would recommend this film to anyone because there is something there for anyone, unless your into musicals as there isn't much singing in the film. There is high's and low's in this film and I must confess even I had a tear in my eye at various points. I left the cinema feeling so proud for what these three women achieved not only for themselves but also for mankind. I just pray that we soon as a world end up in a situation where no one is discriminated against, but I feel that could be one small step for man that is too far a leap.",

I would have enjoyed this movie if it had been shown realistically and accurately, but non-realistic situations twisted it making me feel I'd been treated like an ignorant kid. Many reviewers say this movie is 'very real', and I GET the overall message, like the shock realization of the segregation at the time (even though many of those scenes too were not as portrayed, like the never-happened smashing of the 'colored ladies room' sign!). But it's when they mess around adding amazing actions that also didn't happen as portrayed, that causes me to have doubts in the whole movie.\nFor example (spoiler alert!) when Dorothy takes on the IBM computer, she moves an oscilloscope probe from one pin on a huge interconnection board to another and the computer bursts into life. First, there's no way ANY computer programmer (regardless of color!) would know the intricacies of the interconnections - even the guy(s) who designed it would need to refer to a wiring diagram. Second, an oscilloscope only displays signals - hanging a probe on any wire would not cause the computer to work or not work!\nThen as mentioned elsewhere, the tension of Katherine needing to do calculations just minutes before Glenn's mission took off - it's true he had asked for her input, but that was days before, not minutes.\nI could go on but you get the idea. Such a shame when creators just want to make a fast buck producing a movie that ignores the realities of the people they've used to 'base it upon'.",

I lived the era without knowing the great contributions being made by Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn and Mary Jackson until I moved to Hampton, Virginia. The sadness of the story is that it took a movie and President Barack Obama to recognize their achievements more than fifty years later. This unto itself is an absurdity, until you realize the players were completely out of character from mainstream (white) America back in the day! I give the choice of title for the movie a very high rating. To this rater, hidden numbers is more a metaphor representing the numbers of brilliant African-American women hidden in an obscure and remote building, while making daily contributions to the success of the NASA space program. Their brilliance is overlooked and never taken for granted, as though they were simply plugging in grunt numbers for a NASA team of scientists to decide what to do with these numbers.Taraji P. Henson gives an inspiring performance as Katherine G. Johnson. She lets her light shine to portray moments of glory and triumph, just as the real-life Katherine would have done. There were one or two scenes that might have conflicted with the protocol of the era, but I understand the need for convincing some audience of how things might have been back in the day. Someone had to make decisions, so it might as well be the Boss, as portrayed by Kevin Kostner.Overall, it was a great movie, very entertaining, and this writer did learn a thing or two about a time in history not so far away.",

But this film presents the role of three black American women who performed this role in an engaging and satisfying way. It confronts the social backdrop of the era \u2013 racial and sexual discrimination, segregation and blatant unfairness in a frustratingly realistic way.It would seem that the three women's roles did not link and overlap to anything like the extent portrayed, and apparently lead Katherine G Johnson's part in the story occurred quite a few years earlier. I did not find this overly distracting, as the strength of the story and the way it was told through performances, screenplay and settings trumped historical misgivings. One wonders whether some of the scenes occurred in the way portrayed, or even occurred at all, but I can accept why they remained, even though the film would probably have been stronger without them.It confronted the challenges of the march of progress and casualties along the way when the IBM mainframe computer arrives, and the differing reactions of those who interacted with it.Taraji P Henson (Katherine), Octavia Spencer (Dorothy Vaughan) and Janelle Monae (Mary Jackson) were a convincing shining trio that delivered the story with aplomb. Octavia Spencer in particular had the evenness and consistency that took her role above the others. Kevin Costner was wonderful as the team leader; and Jim Parsons as the selfish second in charge and Kirsten Dunst as the wielder of small power HR director made the most of their opportunities \u2013 or possibly they made more of the opportunities than was really justified, as some of their delivery seemed heavy handed and overwrought.The settings and locations both externally, internally and in and around the space craft were evocative of the period, as were the costumes and overall styling. It was amazing how many 1950s cars must remain in the US, in the near new condition that would have been the case at the time.The film justifies its length, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.",

The women: Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henderson); Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spenser); and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae).Back in the day when we were kids, we saw news programs of NASA putting rockets with men in them into orbit. We saw that they did so seamlessly and after while it became like a piece of cake. Well, this movie shows us that a lot more went into that piece of cake then we were told or knew about. So much so that we had no idea what it was like for black women working at the Langley NASA compound with Colored sections for almost everything. Katherine is the known math genius who knew Analytical Geometry a very specialized math that Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) feels is most necessary to put a man into space. Dorothy knows computers and bones up on the Fortran language that the new IBM 7090 computer runs on. Mary also works in the Computer section, but wants to become an Engineer to work with the engineers there but because she doesn't have the required degree she cannot. She petitions the courts to allow her to take the required courses at a strictly White school and that was granted. Katherine works at the Flight Research Division and has absences to use the Colored Bathroom about \u00bd mile away. This takes a while before Harrison notices she is not at her desk and when she comes in the door soaking wet and tells where she was Harrison finally takes the imitative to terminate all Colored Bathrooms and they are to use restroom closest to their desks.We see that Katherine is instrumental in doing the math for John Glenn's (Glen Powell) launch and recovery. She is kind of acknowledged for superior work but it is all low key. We had no idea there were problems at Langley between white men and black women. Who knew? But these women fought thru all the obstacles to find their place in history . As far as America knew all went smoothly at Langley. It was very uncomfortable seeing these women treated that way. It's not that the United States had a Segregation problem, no, the US had an Integration problem. And probably still does in many instances. Notables: Kirsten Dunst as Vivian Mitchell a supervisor over Dorothy and her computing group; Jim Parsons as Paul Stafford, the Chief Engineer under Harrison's main research group and not very friendly to Katherine.Stay until the end of the movie to find out what happened to those 3-women and it's all good.I love movies where someone has special powers or a talent that everyone is in awe of.

Love love Kirsten and Kevin, They can really become a different character through movies. And I really hated Jim Parsons which is good on his acting part, guess I can't stand him in general for some reason xD I love all the small details that made me see 60's Americas racial problems more accurately. I love the scene when black ladies squad walk together in office, I love toilet scene, I love trial scene. And the esthetic is there for me, love the outfits, love the blue car, love the opening scene. It's not a 10/10 movie but still soo good, especially watching it together with family. Shoutout to black culture references. They can party old way and THE way.",

S. space program. This may sound like some politically correct forced anti-racism equality film at first, but this one is actually a rare gem, like Green Book, where that is not the case. It isn't propagandistic or \"preachy\" in any sense of the word; it's a real story that people collaborated on to share with the rest of us, and, in my opinion, The Example, along with visceral \"The Help\" and \"Green Book\", of how a film about discrimination, racism and equality should look like. What makes this film stand out from similar films is that there really are two parallel main plotlines unfolding at the same time and both of them would have been interesting by themselves alone; the space race with the Russians being the second one.We follow these three women, an early computer scientist, an engineer and a brilliant mathematician as they work their backs off trying to do what they love and what they are good at, despite the stone walls that are being put up in front of them for the mere fact that their skin is of other color AND their gender doesn't suit the labels of a \"NASA employee\". This was one of the first films which back in 2016 introduced me to how bad the racism situation in America was; growing up in Russia where the only black person I've ever seen was a TV-celebrity Pierre Narcisse, a one-song phenomena with his \"Chocolate Hare\" (yes, really), racism was always some distant, barely real theoretical concept. We never learned about segregation in school, the mass separation of people based on their race where people were literally forced to always only sit at the back of the bus, go to black-only schools and use black-only restrooms (which may sound trivial at the first ignorant glance, but, as it is brilliantly portrayed in the film, is actually a huge problem). All the things we take for granted as basic human rights were just taken away from them and there was nothing you could do about it, because you were born into the \"wrong kind of body\". No matter how well you served and loved your country, it just didn't love you back. Through the most subtle, intelligent little scenes this film gives us a clear picture of the burning, unbearable injustice these poor women had to deal with. But despite the harsh topic the film is surprisingly easy to watch: it is funny, it is interesting and it fills you with hope and determination that such things must never come to be in any form ever again. A truly great picture.Available on Dysney+.",

But I want to underline the defects because I fell like this movie had so much potential but it has been wasted quite a bit. The real problem is that there are too many storylines and so few time to explore properly all of them. The result is not confusing, there are no rushed parts or plot points hardly comprehensible. The real problem of this is that the movie lose a lot of tension or emotional weight and stays pretty much superficial, with character construction that was simple and basic, nothing more. Also the beautiful messages about racial and gender equity feels superficial because of the poor time to explore them.\nOn the other end the direction and the photography are functional, all the acting performances were great and the music is suited.\nIn conclusion it is a movie which probably most of the people will like (even strongly) but very few will love or hate (unless you are personally trongly involved its inclusion message).",

Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons and Mahershala Ali.The story of a team of African-American women mathematicians who served a vital role in NASA during the early years of the US space program.In Theodore Melfi's Hidden Figures, three heroic women who were a vital part of NASAs early years, are strongly portrayed by three wonderful actresses; Tarija P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, thankfully bringing the remarkable true story into the limelight.A smart, refreshing script is blissfully aided by cinematographer Mandy Walker's \"Kodachrome\" direction, capturing each scene with two distinct tones; warm and cold. Though a simple story, it's told with care and although slightly dramatised, it's hugely investing. Henson, Spencer and Mon\u00e1e are all perfect performers, becoming very likable mere minutes into the picture. Henson takes the lead, however, with a showcase of pure strength and drive.The 1950s/60s are always interesting to see brought to the big screen, especially in the costume and production design. Both departments have delivered in every sense, alongside the art director and set decorator to achieve the utmost detail, in doing so, creating a working environment the actors can connect with and the audience can adhere to.If I had to say anything I disliked about Hidden Figures, it would be the decision to cast Dunst and Parsons. The two felt inapposite and while both gave satisfying performances, I never once clicked with their characters. Costner executed his character with skill and ease, yet the two aforementioned lacked any unique traits in their rather substantial roles. The original soundtrack by Pharrell Williams is overflowing with energy, featuring tracks written specifically for the picture, including feel-good cues composed by Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch. Each track feels largely appropriate not only for the imagery but for the time period, also.There's a lot to like in Hidden Figures, and for all of the right reasons it ticks all of the right boxes. Verdict; Vibrant characters, stylish writing and a funky soundtrack ignite a flourishing work of brilliance in Theodore Melfi's historical drama.Hidden Figures, 9/10.",

It also showed empowerment, not just for women but also for every people of color, and I think this was the most inspiring part for me. The three main protagonists showed that even if they have different skin colors and are women, they can still do jobs that men can do. They showed how much a woman is worthy of any work in the present time. The film has inspired me because they have done incredible things to make history, and they have proved that everyone can do what they want to do and be who they want to be. If they work hard and be determined to reach their goals, they can. It was compelling and inspiring to see because I love films, particularly those based on a true story and show history.

There is a nice balance of technology and ethnicity presented, and one also feels not only the passion of these women to succeed in both a man's world and a racially discriminate one, but the passion to rise above the black-white threshold imposed by an ignorant and prejudicial culture.

These two topics are reason enough to see a well mode movie but Hidden Figures is much more than that.It's actually a fascinating work-place drama set in the early days of the space race. It's a more grounded depiction of that time in history because usually movies about the space race are about the achievement itself, the rocket taking off with the wife or girlfriend with a tear in her eye. Little to no mind giving to the grind, the trial and error, and the tense conditions they were working in at a time when technology wasn't as evolved as it is today.This movie is clearly dramatized, it's not a documentary, but there is a lot to learn here. I had no idea that they were people, women, who's job was to do complex math. The surprising thing is not that women were doing math - well giving the time period it kind of is. It's the the inner workings of N.A.S.A.The sheer importance and scale of the whole opperation is not lost on the viewer, they make sure of that. Which makes it is all the more mind-boggling that given the importance of what they were trying to achieve that they had time to discriminate. I know that racism and discrimination is systemic, particularly, in this era but come the F'k on how was it not a meritocracy?I could stress on that point for so long but that would be like shouting at the wind at this point. Don't get it wrong, the biaises are not just based on race but on women in general, there's a clear hierachy of discrimination showed in this film but the silver lining though, is that these women are also depicted striving for more, overcoming obsticles, leading the way.The cast is quite big and yet memorable, they all make an impression. I saw this movie when it came out in 2016 and even before rewatching it - because it's worth repeat viewings - I could list the cast by name or remember faces, if not the names. It's a testament to the level of talent there's in this film. The smallest roles have space to shine and the actors knew how to seize their opportunities.Henson is front and center in this movie and yet Spencer and Monae are true stand outs. Kristen Dunst, opperates masterfully in a grey area as both an \"oppressed\" and pottential oppressor, Glen Powell is charismatic and a source of hope, and Kevin Costner does a fabulous job but Seth Meyer's sketch does sour a bit aspects of his character.Hidden Figures is a compelling learning experience that will hit you in the feels and worth the viewings.",

Henson, and the role she played in getting a man on the moon.\nAt a time in history when opportunities were slim for African Americans, let alone an African American woman, Katherine Johnson created her own opportunity through brilliance and skill. The theme of the movie is about powerful female leaders and what they can accomplish. As a mother of two girls, I appreciated the emphasis that was placed on the women and how they overcame obstacles to achieve their dreams. In addition to Katherine Johnson, the movie also told the stories of Dorothy Vaughan, played by Octavia Spencer, and Mary Jackson, played by Janelle Mon\u00e1e. All three women were mathematicians who worked for NASA. Johnson was a human computer whose calculations were instrumental in landing on the moon. Spencer led a team of women and taught herself and her team computer programming. Jackson was an engineer at NASA at a time when the field was dominated by men. All three women made significant contributions to NASA, despite the roadblocks and prejudice they encountered.\nIn addition to their time spent at NASA, the movie also shows images of family life and what it was like for a woman to balance a career and family at that time. They faced bias both at work and in their daily lives and the movie touches upon the prevalent racism of the time. If you enjoy The Help, this is another movie along the same theme. It tells the story of injustice and prejudice, but also of overcoming trials and not letting petty, nearsighted people get in the way.\nThe movie made great use of space and angles to capture moments of tension, joy, excitement, love and many other emotions. The music of the film also lent itself to the emotions that were conveyed, giving the viewer an experience that they were right there with the characters in some of the scenes.\nFor a movie that shows how triumphing over adversity can help a person achieve their goals, Hidden Figures delivers. It is a movie to watch over and over because you are left with a sense of satisfaction and awe at what these women accomplished.",

Both the story and the actors are so amazing you can't walk away without thinking, \"How will people view us 50 years from now around our thoughts about refugees, mental illness, etc.\" I wish I could have met the three women (one is still alive - living in a nursing home in VA). They were amazing. How I wish I could meet the author of the book, the director of the movie, and the actors and tell them how much this movie has changed me.

Taraji Henson is easily the stand-out, carrying every emotional scene with her weight, and propelling the film to its great status. Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae do wonderfully, but simply do not have as much gravitas as Henson. These three actresses have a great chemistry between them, portraying their characters with true poignancy. Theodore Melfi has made a surprisingly straightforward and simple story into an electrically charged film, fuelled with excitement and attitude. This is a great achievement for Melfi, who is new in the directing seat. The use of real footage and true stories intertwined into the fictitious story works well to establish a period film.

I liked this film bc it was like a family appropriate view of social, gender issues of the 60s. So if the most critical thing that can be said about it is \"it's too cheesy\" or something like that then they're just being overly critical. I really really enjoyed this film, it portrayed the racial tension in a less over the top manner than what we're used to seeing on film, or in real life for that matter. Taraji is such a good actress, as is Octavia Spencer (even tho I can't help but think of her adorable character in ZOOTOPIA when I hear her voice) but it's Monae who's surprisingly good. She's been around musically for like 10 years so it's nice she's finding mainstream success in a different way. Ultimately I most enjoyed that this movie brought to the masses a story that otherwise never would've found as big of an audience. I think that's one of the negatives of the U.S. public school system, we rarely are taught the underlying facts of many of the greatest accomplishments of our country's history.

It got really tedious.Additionally, if they were trying to create an atmosphere similar to the 60s, why was there modern music? It was really distracting and unfitting. The casting here was rough. I can't take Parsons seriously, same with Powell who I just see as the idiot from Scream Queens. They really didn't sell that they were brilliant scientists. Other than that, the acting was pretty good, namely Henson, and it's disappointing she wasn't nominated instead of Davis.The movie really suffered anytime it cut to Katherine's personal life. Those scenes really dragged on and didn't seem to have any affect on her professional life, which was what the movie was about.

Also the fact that they were ladies put a bigger problem but NASA just wanted their calculations correct no matter the cost. And even though their was problems with the colored section people accepted the ladies because they could do things no other person could and their math and calculations and brains were better then any white male or white women.

Spencer I know and always watch no matter what the movie is, and her story as well as Monae's really point to major issues that specifically targeted African American women trying to establish themselves in the professional arena. (Separately, you clearly see the women in engineering issues, but women of color were historically known to have the hardest struggle in the US.) Henson's performance just made me want to hug her. Amazing job.

            "content": "On the way home from seeing Hidden Figures, I flipped my car radio on to WRKF, the Baton Rouge public radio station my wife and I have listened to and supported since we moved here in August 1982. It came on in the middle of Bob Dylan's Ring them bells, the program being Nick Spitzer's American Routes. Although that song was recorded in 1989 at the end of Bob's Christian period, long after I'd quit paying attention to him for all practical purposes, the music, words and message echo his protest songs of the early 1960s.. Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf\nRing them bells for all of us who are left\nRing them bells for the chosen few\nWho will judge the many when the game is through\nRing them bells, for the time that flies\nFor the child that cries\nWhen innocence diesI wouldn't have known or recognized the song had I not bought the Amnesty International Chimes of Freedom 2012 compilation of 72 Bob Dylan covers two years ago. For that collection, Natasha Beddington, a popular young British singer whom I'd never heard of prior to that, performed a lovely cover of Ring them bells in pop R&B style. I was in the process of reviewing all the songs and researching the artists when my Mom became ill and I never finished that project.Next was the Byrds' 1969 psychedelic folk rock cover of Dylan's This wheel's on fire, the version the Zambo Flirts modeled an arrangement on and often performed live back in the '70s (\"Please notify my next of kin, this wheel shall explode\"), followed by Dylan's completely hilarious after all these years Talking World War 3 Blues from 1961. By the magic of synchronicity, 1961 was the year Alan Shepard piloted the first US manned space launch, an event at the center of the action of Hidden Figures. The relevance of my long prelude: walking from the theater to my car I'd already been transported by the film back to the time of the Space Race, a signature geopolitical contest at the height of the Cold War, when it was the West against the East, the Free World against the Communist Bloc. The old friends I grew up with and other peers will remember seeing PSA's showing Nikita Khrushchev pounding his shoe on the podium at the UN and shouting (according to the subtitles) \"We will bury you!\" We remember John F. Kennedy challenging us to \"Ask not what your country can do for you...\" Back then (and long afterwards) anyone who publically questioned the Russians being our mortal enemies risked being the subject of a dossier in J. Edgar Hoover's desk, something that affects my thinking to this day. America was desperate not to be beaten in any venue by the Russians. When their Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space five weeks ahead of our Alan Shepherd, the nation and the much-heralded NASA space program were deeply humiliated.This is the context of Hidden Figures, the fact-based story of a group of highly intelligent, motivated and competent black women performing critically important work for NASA. I'm writing this review instead of my usual practice of doing background research on films based on history (a somewhat endangered discipline as I write this although I still believe it will outlive the current era of alt-facts). Thus, I have not fact-checked the film for accuracy. Be that as it may, Hidden Figures is a beautiful movie. It focuses on three real people, all black women employed at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA who worked on Project Mercury. The goal was to send astronauts into outer space and bring them home safely. Putting humans into space has always been a dicey proposition. The scientists and engineers at Langley had the heavy responsibility of designing, building, testing and approving the rockets, space vehicles and flight plans that had a significant chance of resulting in not just more national humiliation but the horrifying public deaths of our ultimate fly boys, the hand-picked guys who epitomized the Right Stuff. The task required bold mathematical, technological, and ergonomic innovation on a daily basis under intense pressure.The lead actresses, Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and the irrepressible Janelle Monae are uniformly brilliant and engaging, portraying three exemplary patriots and public servants. We follow the women as they maintain their dignity under duress in the classic tradition of the Civil Rights Movement, make essential contributions to the success of Project Mercury, and hold precious private lives together while enduring the unapologetic racism and sexism of this time and place. The indignities they routinely suffer at and away from work are painful to watch, no less so for a viewer who recognizes that the struggle for opportunity, justice and basic human rights they embody is unfinished business even today, some 56 years later. Fine supporting performances are turned in by Kevin Costner as project director Al Harrison, Kirsten Dunst as the chilly supervisor of female NASA's employees, and Glen Powell as rock star astronaut John Glenn, among quite a few others. Hidden Figures is ultimately an uplifting, inspiring, feel good movie. It made me laugh, cry, and feel that pride we all have deep down of being a citizen of the USA, the ongoing experiment in self-government of which each fellow American is a stakeholder. It reminded me of who I am, the path I've traveled to arrive where I am, and, above all, affirmed who our greatest President, at another time of national crisis, once declared we all are:\"We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\" (Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861).Go see it.",

It was really wonderful to see a film which has science and mathematics as part of its subject where you actually get a flavour of what the science is. So often (for example in the film about Ramanujan) the makers are so scared that they give no real clue to what the science is about. This film is different: it brings science alive to the general public. A must must see, not just for the stories of these heroic people, but also as an example of the way public engagement in science should be done---not in a patronising or \"spooky\" way, but by giving at least some idea of what the scientists were actually doing, and why it mattered. And to do that while also dealing with what is, I imagine, the main point of the film is an act of cinematic genius.",

            "content": "Together with Fences and Moonlighting, it seems the Academy is showing some major love to the Black community after drawing some flak for how White last year's nominees were. Or is this in quiet defiance of the current administration, showing how great America has become because of these three hidden figures?The movie is about the story of three African-American Women instrumental to the US space program working as \"human computers\" in the 1960s. Imagine being Black, a Woman and can do \"on any given day, analyze the binomial levels air displacement, friction and velocity. And compute over ten thousand calculations by cosine, square root and lately analytic geometry. By hand.\" At the same time, be subjected to use a \"Colored\" restroom, be limited to use books found only in the \"Colored\" section and be forced to fight for your right as a \"Colored\" student to study in a white school just because you want to better your life.While the movie took some liberty at changing some of the things that happened in order to make for a better story (comparable to last year's nominee 'Bridges of Spies' starring Tom Hanks), such as the apparent hostility of the white, male-dominated division Katherine Jackson was assigned to or the recalculation of the Go/No Go reentry of John Glenn from outer space, it all makes for a good story and is forgivable because sometimes some people just try to live their life the best way they know how: acting right, doing right and living right. And often, those are the kind that live boring lives.The three leads were effective even if the roles were derivative, Janelle Monae as the feisty third player, Octavia Spencer as the glue that holds everyone together (and notching a Best Supporting Actress in the process) and Taraji P. Henson as the reserved wallflower that will explode in the middle of the movie. Although there were times I questioned the choice of Taraji because sometimes you can see she's struggling with the acting.

I believe anyone who has had a full bladder before, will naturally sympathize with the catch-22 in the movie where she needs to run as quickly as possible to and from the bathroom while enduring the accusing look from her white colleagues. I was also furious when Dorothy and her children could not even lend a book at a library just because she was looking around in the white section. To quote what she has told her boys on a bus where there are also colored sections, just because that is the way it is doesn't make it right. The last impressive bit was when Mary filed a petition and fought for her night course at a white-only high school. Her speech in the court was both motivating and thought-provoking because it is de facto an unprecedented but marvelous practice for a black woman to touch the stars in a hierarchical and racist society.There are still plenty of other outrageous details from coffee kettles to unequal pay throughout. Everything is so true that I could not help but wonder how people could live like this and why the hell no one else stood up for them. It just haunts me when I put myself in their shoes, picturing myself living in a world where I am a secondary citizen and there are always things that I can never lay my hands on or places where I can never set foot in. How cruel it is!Despite all that, these women still rose to the challenge and even turned the tide for a country that put them in a disadvantaged position. It is the distressing history and soul-touching struggles of these women that I now look at the world from a different perspective. This is a world where we will all suffer from injustice, yet nothing can defeat a person and even the whole community's determination and intelligence.One will rise through the ranks as long as one keeps improving themselves and turning themselves into someone irreplaceable. Following my own life experience, this is the golden rule that applies to all aspects in life, from work to relationship. May we all succeed and shine brightly in our own fields one day!Sybil.",

The male characters also did a very good job, but were definitely outshone by the strength of the women. I hope many people in the country continue to celebrate these women.",

Acting from all lead actors are brilliant and story is solid. I don't find it boring at all for the whole 2 hours and very engaging. Most drama, I find it boring but really enjoyed some like Imitation Game or Theory of Everything or Social Network.I have been reading many negative reviews and I don't agree with them.

I love it when actors come together and get you to believe they are really best friends. I'm a computer history geek at heart so every time anything computer related was mentioned I tingled with delight. The editing of this film was great, not a confusing scene, everything worked together well. There were no holes in the story that I could see (probably because it was based on facts). This movie could of been three hours long and I would of still sat through it, and that's hard for me to do. I went to watch Fences and man I wanted to walk out half way through.You will be surprised when you see what these woman go through on a professional level in order to get where they want to be. I also think this movie was playing nice (or maybe the book was) when displaying the treatment of our leads, but hey I can't complain it still was a great movie.It's hard to believe that NASA back then had so much difficulty doing their jobs or getting a man in space. Maybe there is a reason we haven't went back to the moon. No one knows how! I love how this movie shows that sometimes you have to fight to get credit for your work. This happens often in the work place. These ladies handle it nicely. They play the game better than the white employees they worked with.I wish there could be a part two to this movie, but sadly I know there won't be. I guess I'll just have to keep re watching this one.",

            "content": "\"Hidden Figures\" proved to be a sleeper hit in the US and then went on to gain three Oscar nominations including Best Picture. That a film where the primary characters are black women who also are mathematicians for NASA should be a surprise force at the box office is a massive understatement. It is a testimony to Theodore Melfi as director and co-writer with Allison Schroeder as to the skill to inject what could have been a run of the mill drama with warmth and enough racial history to elevate the material and allow it to be a safe vehicle for examining where the US has come from and ironically where it is in 2017. The film has the luxury of three incredible women to showcase, who each individually made great strides for women and African Americans though the film makes Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) the lead story ably supported by the portrayals of Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae). All three started out as 'computers', that is human computers who helped calculate the immense amount of math needed to establish the NASA space program. Soon all three are pushing the boundaries of an institution still wrestling with how to leave behind WWII era thinking both scientifically and socially. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of that era knows what happens in terms of putting the first American into space and the pressure to beat the Russians in technological expertise. The story comes alive in the nuances of living in a Virginia, still segregated under state law, where daily tasks prove so much more difficult and in some case almost impossible. To be clear the film is nothing resembling a documentary. The events are pitched for effect, characters mixed with others as the time frames were much longer but the essence of kicking doors down which had long been closed to minorities is true to the spirit of the times and a film much needed right now where the value of both science and a diverse population are both openly questioned by the Trump administration. The leads are all very good in charismatically holding the lens. The roles are showy to liven up the subject matter and only Butler seems especially grounded and so it is not surprising that she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Kevin Costner reminds you why he is still a movie star, dominating every scene he is in. Jim Parsons (unrecognisable in manner from his TV work) and Kirsten Dunst are very good in unlikeable roles. The whole ensemble is very good across the board and really allows the film to hold your attention despite a two hour running time. It is rare that a film can be recommended as great family viewing and simultaneously be a salve to the daily news. I hope that the White House plays this film, many might learn why the US was once respected and revered across the globe despite any failings because it was seen as a place which recognised the constraints of reality and then tried to improve on them.",

You can't help but watch something like this and feel tainted by the values and actions of white people of the time.

Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson; three coloured women living and working in Virginia, USA during the 60's who stopped at nothing to show a world full of generalisations that they were highly underestimated.The movie follows Katherine G. Johnson, an exceptional mathematician who is given the opportunity to work as 'computer' at NASA for the 1961-62 missions in the all-important 'space-race'. Alongside her were friends Dorothy Vaughn (computer-turned-supervisor with a knack for programming) and Mary Jackson (a wannabe aeronautics-engineer).The standard of acting throughout was fantastic; not only did Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae provide us with wonderfully powerful, and terribly funny, depictions of the leads, but a surprise role from Mahershala Ali and an unrecognisable Kevin Costner made for a praise-worthy ensemble (all bar Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst, who I felt could have added more to their respective roles).From cinematography to costume, the entire movie was fairly good - I wouldn't say flawless, but certainly to a decent standard. The plot itself was interesting, and the overtly 'Hollywood' glamorisation was combated with live-footage of the real-life events - which added a nice touch.A Pharrell-Williams-saturated soundtrack (and, of course, a musical number for Janelle Monae), the music was fun and fit in well with Hidden Figures as a whole, though I can't help thinking more of a variation (instead of one all-too-often-repeated song) of songs could have been sampled. Either way, Pharrell was probably just happy to be involved.Slightly (though slightly-understandably) agenda-pushing, I can't help but refer to similarities to Apollo 13 (the Friendship 7 landing scene reeked of Tom Hanks' blackout) and Octavia Spencer's earlier character in The Help - slightly unoriginal is the point here too.Nostalgia-inducing - even for those not of the time - and portrayed almost expertly - but arguably too reminiscent of already-done pictures.https://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk",

Johnson, played by Taraji P. Hensen, who tries to be more useful than the little that brings his brilliant mind. Like Janelle Mon\u00e1e interpreting to Mary Jackson, that in the film looks for its title of university to be Engineer.

We did have \"A Beautiful Mind\" in 2001 which used about one minute of film time on John Nash's game theory, and we did see the development of an aerodynamic equation to help the boys find their rocket in the woods in \"October Sky\" (1999). Accordingly, kudos go to the filmmakers of \"Hidden Figures\" for bringing the story of these NASA mathematicians, who happened to be young black women, to our attention, and highlighting their computational skills. And of course it helps, as far as the viewer's interest is concerned, that the math was employed at NASA during the initial critical years of the space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and where the Soviet Union had the early lead from Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin (first human in space).These three black women mathematicians / engineers are indeed remarkable for their time when educational opportunities were much less available for women and for blacks, particularly in technical fields where suspicion reigned. We see in the film some of the social impediments they faced from unhelpful colleagues and organizational barriers. There's some doubt in my mind from what I've read of these women's experiences that the filmmakers have accurately portrayed the social and physical handicaps confronting these women. It seems that overdid these handicaps to (understandably) provide more drama to what otherwise might have been just a technical story. I don't have a problem with a degree of dramatic license if it adds a degree of dramatic tension to a story that might otherwise be too bland for non-technical-minded folks, but \"Hidden Figures\" overdid it a bit. NASA was a technical organization, and while it may have harbored individuals with personal prejudices, institutionally it was more of a meritocratic organization. After all, it relied on a ex-Nazi, Werner Von Braun, to help build the fabulous Saturn 5 Rocket.Perceptions and personal perspective are everything it seems. I'm amazed of how many reviews on this site decry the portrayal of white people in this film. There wasn't a lot of overt, hostile racism (if any) and suspicious and recalcitrant co-workers are redeemed in the end by their emerging respect for the black women mathematicians. On the other side some critics have written very unfavorably about the \"white savior\" complexion of the film, e.g., the white supervisor (Kevin Costner) comes to the rescue by chopping down the \"Whites Only\" sign over the nearest ladies room; a sign that in real life the woman mathematician simply ignored with no apparent consequences. Perhaps the filmmakers struck a happy balance, and there's no doubt that, commercially at least, they were \"redeemed\" by a box office of $236 M on a budget of $25 M!",

Each of them showed compassion, kindness and tolerance while throwing a little shade and chutzpah at the established order of things. Also want to throw a shout out to Kevin Costner and Jim Parson's for their roles in this movie equally done as they showed the thinking of the time in a job that was normally held by White Males' and they slowly come around to opening their minds. Especially after the scene were Katherine goes off on the whole team about why it is she has to use a separate bathroom that is half way across the facility and also a separate coffee pot. You can almost hear the thought process of Mr. Harrison after Katherine storms off as he looks at the Coffee pot and see's the word \"Colored\" on it. You can swear with a look he gives the rest of the team of \"Seriously!?\" as he takes the sticker off and then he goes to town on the bathroom sign.

White people are awful, stupid,and are all artificially in their high positions because of their race; we get it Hollywood. Gag! Remember in \"Ray\", where Ray Charles was banned from Georgia? That never happened in real life, either. It was yet another jab at whitey, to make them look like evil incarnate.Hardly anyone ever heard of this lady who this movie alleges single- handedly rescued the space program from the silly white people who ran NASA in the 60s. Her real role was negligible, and she was really part of a large team; not a lone, brilliant savior this movie makes her out to be. Nobody retelling the story (including \"We Could Not Fail: The First African Americans in the Space Program\") of the early days of NASA mentions Katherine Johnson at all. And if you look at pictures of Katherine Johnson, she's about the whitest \"black\" woman you've ever seen. She just suddenly appears; the subject of this amazing story nobody else seems to remember and is thrust into the limelight by Obama and Hollywood (and the book, but who reads?).Katherine Johnson herself has said in interviews she never felt any racism in NASA, as it was totally merit-based. There were bathrooms in the east buildings and the whole running a half a mile thing was totally made up for effect. How convenient for the writers that John Glenn is dead, so nobody can corroborate or refute the claim that he wanted \"the smart girl\" to double-check the computer's calculations. Everyone who knows anything about history, knows early NASA was nearly all German Jew World War 2 refugees and ex-Nazi rocket scientists.Jack Crenshaw - one of the actual early NASA geniuses, says on his website, \"Now back to the movie. From what I can gather, it's a very different story, and absolutely _DOES_ seem to claim that these three women saved the space program. It also, I'm told, portrays all the white guys as incompetent nincompoops.THAT, I can tell you, is absolutely false. The NASA engineers of that era were the most hard-working and competent engineers I've met anywhere, at any time. And I've met a bunch.Someone else here pointed out that the black actors in the movie are portraying real people, while the 'white guys' are all 'composite figures' with fictitious names. There's a reason for that: the real white guys refused to let themselves be portrayed the way the producers wanted to. That should tell you what's going on.\"So, aside from the fact that this is an extremely racially-repulsive propaganda film from the uber anti-white extremists who have taken over Hollywood, it's a decent movie. I was already enamored with Janelle, from her musical career and now I'm completely in love with her. The movie is also, at times, quite funny. If you can get past all white people being portrayed as bumbling bigots and having to be rescued by black heroines, maybe you'll be entertained.",

            "content": "Last year, the Academy was boycotted by thousands for its lack of diversity. A lot of people expressed their disappointment for the absence of coloured actors from the Oscars nominations. It seems that the Academy have learned their lesson. This year all four acting categories feature coloured actors/actresses names and three films featuring colored main characters are among the Best Picture contenders. One of them, Hidden Figures, showcases perfectly what discrimination and racism feels like by presenting the struggles that coloured women had to face in a white-men-driven America during the early 60s.Three brilliant coloured women - Katherine (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) and Mary (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) - manage to get a job in NASA. Shamefully enough, almost one century after the end of Civil War, segregation hasn't ceased. The situation for these three women and every other woman of their ethnic group is, at the very least, derogatory. They are not allowed to go to white people's toilets, they get much fewer opportunities and Katherine cannot even use the same coffee pot as her colleagues. As these weren't enough, the pressure and work load they have to face in NASA is huge. The year is 1961 and the space race between the Soviet Union and the United States is more intense than ever. Things get even worse when news of Russia sending the first man into space reach the world. However, we're not talking about any women. Katherine, Dorothy and Mary are determined to overcome any difficulties and show the world what they are made of.The film tells a story that most of us were unaware of. We've seen dozens of American films that take place in the early 60s. There are films about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Vietnam War, Elvis Presley, the British Invasion bands, and so many other topics. However, we rarely see a film that focuses on people of those days and especially the racial minorities. Among all that technological advancement, humanity was cast aside. It was 1961 and people of colour were still treated as lesser beings. Hidden Figures recounts the events in a particularly touching way. While speaking of the huge achievements of NASA in the space race, it subtly emphasizes on the effort of the people who were responsible for them and particularly the three women who set an example for thousands of others. The cast delivered an amazing performance and the result was an emotional and didactic story that pays true homage to the real people.Of course, the film has its drawbacks. It suffers from a defect found in many biographical films. They tend to glamorize their characters to the extent of portraying them as infallible supporting them with minor characters who by now have become too clich\u00e9. Katherine, Mary and Dorothy have absolutely no faults whereas Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parson's characters are unlikable from the very first moment. By the time the happy ending comes, everyone's problems seem to have disappeared and the main characters are now loved by everyone. This is the reason I rarely find a biographical film to amaze me. Apart from that though, every aspect of the film was masterfully dealt with. In general, it makes for a great and quite informative viewing.More reviews on https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com",

But about the movie I found amazing that all Black guys working for NASA on this Movie are the Religion Juzsys!! Why?? Are all those Slaves from Africa from this Religion??!! It is very irritating that this happens! Why NO White guys on NASA where praying for jyzsys and only the Blacks were praying??!! And with a Military formation I know that Control is very important! and looks like to me that having 2 NASAs, one black and other white can explain a lot of problems in that Organization! Maybe somebody with Satan Curiosity want to reach the DEVIL Bottom of this RACISM problem!!",

The racism is sometimes subtle and other times blatant, and the tension is brilliantly depicted. At heart, the story is about forgetting socially constructed segregation to come together and to do something beyond all humans, to send a human being into space. The three main actresses do an amazing job. I especially love Janelle Monae's character. She's just really memorable. And Taraji is amazing in all her scenes. One scene in particular stands out and pretty much slapped me in the face with her emotions so kudos to her for that! I'm actually gonna go back and re-watch that scene in particular.Kevin Costner's character was also one of my favorites. He was awesome to watch. I would watch this film again. It's about space, women, and race. Also a good life lesson about technology and how being the one to know how to handle new tech puts you at an advantage in the workforce.10/10.",

But these ladies were not only fighting being discriminated because of their race, but equally their gender. And these women were exceptional. Unfortunately, as this movie shows, a woman must be *exceptional* in order to attain the same respect and recognition as her male counterparts. They had to outperform the men, in order to be seen as equal. And I cheered at every single victory. Sadly, it takes a white male of power and standing to instigate change - we see Katherine in particular proving her worth and Al realising he was able to remove some of the obstacles in her way, and you're really given the impression that many under him are not of the same opinion. In our current climate where issues of racism and sexism are threatening to resurface and progress to be reversed, this film highlights exactly how hard it was to achieve the progress in the first place.Overall, a fantastic story which highlights the contribution of black women to NASA and the space race, who are utterly overlooked in every film about this era of NASA that I'm aware of. Women are not just secondary characters in history, not should they be in films.",

            "review_title": "Some History Forgotten",
            "content": "There are a few areas to this review, so please let me start of with the technical aspect.There is a good look to the film and Mandy Walker makes good use of symmetrical frame in most of the shots which helps to create a good bond with the viewer. At times there is a lack of consistency with relation to different shot angles being used in the edit, and poor judgement during the rehearsal and filming phase of the project leaves you wondering if there was a continuity department on set at all.D.C. Cardinali and Ray Ruotolo, did a wonderful job to make the film look good, with some fantastic vignette effects to draw the viewer in, although there is a scene when the entire family is sitting at the table and Colonel Jim asks Katherine to marry him, sadly his shirt has several shades of red and at times pink throughout the scene. I can only presume this was bad judgement during discussions with wardrobe, but this should have been addressed during the scene itself.As for the film:There is no denying that Henson, Spencer and Monae, along with Costner gave some outstanding stellar performances, this is not in question, but there are some areas of the film which must be highlighted and not for any good reason.Janelle Monae, has just been assigned to Engineering when she gets stuck as one of the tests regarding the Freedom capsule is about to take place, she finally frees herself and after a failed test, the head of engineering advised her that she should become an engineer due to the methodical mind. This was said by the Jewish WWII POW who had been brought over to the USA after the war. Throughout there was no mention to the large number of Nazi's brought over to help on the space programme, many of which included scientists who carried out horrific experiments on other humans to see how far the extremities could be pushed. I can only presume this was not mentioned due to this being a feel good film, however it loses marks for this.It is sad to think that the segregation of humans with different coloured skin to such a barbaric extent was just over 50 years ago, and in some instances still continues. In one scene we see Costner knock down a sign over a bathroom which read 'Colored Ladies Toilets' due to Taraji taking 40 minutes to go to a bathroom halfway across the NASA grounds. Yes it felt nice, but there was little explanation and it did feel like this was done more to ensure time wasn't wasted so USA could been USSR to the Moon, rather than for any kind of anti racist motion.The end of the film saw titles explaining what each person did throughout their life, but Taraji, who played Katherine Johnson had titles which explained NASA has awarded her in 2016 for all her commitment, all to wonderful music being played in the background. I'm sorry, are we making light of ignoring someone for nearly 50 years, but hey it's on the big screen now, so it's all good? I thought this was in poor taste and should have been thought through in more detail.Is this a good film? Yes, it's okay, it is a bit fluffy in areas and lacks any real conviction of that era - especially relating to racism. Don't expect to be bowled over, but do expect to leave feeling there are a few good human beings out there.",

To be honest I was kind of struggling to make a decision between this movie \ud83c\udfa5 or another equally highly rated action one.However, I somehow felt instead of viewing those fighting, shooting, bombing and killing perhaps it was more worthwhile to watch some thought-provoking and soul-inspiring artwork. I somehow heard of this art piece sometime ago but didn't get to watch it. And I'm glad to find out that this highly accoladed 7.7/10 rating didn't disappoint me.It is touching because it paints a very real picture of the ethic division or apartheid in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 in the 1960s where colored races notably African Americans were required to use separate bathrooms \ud83d\udebd and attend separate schools \ud83c\udfeb from those white Americans. Such thing is only hard to imagine in today's world \ud83c\udf0e and even harder to believe in one of the most purportedly inclusive and welcoming cultures. African Americans faced so many discriminations at the time and they still do nowadays to a lesser extent.It is inspirational in that it took black Americans a lot of fights to claim their rights, be it Martin Luther King, Jr. at the time or President Barack Obama most recently. As is said nothing comes to you unless you fight for it. As Hillary Clinton said in her 2016 presidential election concession speech, \"This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it.\" All those three African American characters in the show fought fearlessly and tirelessly for their own rights and I'm sure their actions had inspired a whole African American generation.What reaches me too is that we live in such a better and safer world \ud83c\udf0e nowadays where egalitarianism is much better preserved especially in Australia \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa. I was talking to my former manager who is American and she also agreed that racism is much less of a problem although not perfect in Australia \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa compared to the United States. To me this is the beauty of living in a migrant country where multiculturalism is the centerpiece. I honestly don't think \ud83e\udd14 many countries can do a better job in reconciliation between different ethnicities, cultures and religions than Australia \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa. As a country we benefit both economically and culturally from migration and multiculturalism that ensues.Thank you \ud83d\ude4f Hollywood for presenting another wonderful movie \ud83c\udfa5 that quenches my spiritual thirst. Burst of laughter\ud83d\ude06, gasp \ud83d\ude26 of breath, , or shed of tears \ud83d\ude2d - that's what you brings to me. Always get a box \ud83d\udce6 of tissues ready before watching any movie \ud83c\udfa5 - that's my advice, as you never know where you will end up.",

And that's what happened when \"Hidden Figures\" ended--the audience applauded.\"Hidden Figures\" is based on the true story of, principally, three African-American women (in the 1960s, when the story takes place, they were known as Negroes or coloreds) who worked for NASA, just at the beginning of the space race.Taraji P. Henson, of \"Empire\" fame, plays the leading character, Katherine G. Johnson, a math genius; Octavia Spencer (nominated for a supporting actress in any motion picture Golden Globe for her role in this movie) portrays Dorothy Vaughn, who ends up becoming proficient in computer coding languages such as FORTRAN; and Mary Jackson, NASA's first black female engineer, is portrayed by Janelle Monae.All the main characters and all the supporting cast of characters face discrimination (the movie does take place in the 1960s), but they plod on with their lives and their mission to prove themselves and the worthiness of their race. White co-workers. of course, look down on them--not only are they women, they're also Negroes. It might be hard for some to accept that this was the \"normal\" back in the '60s, and it grates on us that this was allowed to happen, but it was and did.Kevin Costner, who plays Al Harrison, a fictional composite of NACA (the precursor to NASA) and NASA directors, is intended to be the reasonable and unprejudiced head honcho, and I would like to think that he truthfully portrays how these men thought and behaved, but I'm doubtful because that's just not the way things were back then.There is lots of good dialogue in this movie, which provided many a giggle, but the story is not intended to be a comedy, nor is it. And the archival footage reminds those, who lived during this time and experienced first hand the space race, what a magical and marvelous time it was. It is a movie I highly recommend seeing.",

I can also remember the violence and changes that followed as segregation was slowly coming to an end.I can remember the first attempts by NASA to orbit the earth, the loss of the first space capsule, and the flight of John Glenn even though it was cut short by a problem. The USA was headed to space and President Kennedy wanted to go to the moon, and go to the moon we did! What a day to remember, the first man from earth stepping from his spacecraft and on to the surface of the moon. Our family later visited Cape Canaveral saw the exhibits and the moon rock. Wowee! This is an extraordinary movie depicting the lives of three colored women, who though not known to most of the USA, played an important role in the race to space. All were employed at NASA and had to endure racial insults by some who perceived them as unequal and were not fit to use the same facilities as the white employees, separate coffee pot and so on. Considering the 50 plus years that have flown by and the space accomplishments of the USA, it is only fitting that these three women be now given the recognition they truly deserve.A great movie for all to see who want a peek at the past and a look into the future.A great cast and superb acting by all.",

But the important role three African American mathematicians, Katherine G. Johnston (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) played in the space program was an eye opener. The story takes place against the background of sixties racial policies which were civil yet still discriminatory. Kevin Costner (Al Harrison) is well suited for his role as both the leader of NASA's mathematics team and the champion of racial equality but Jim Parsons (Paul Stafford) and Kirsten Dunst (Vivian Michell) add little more than star power to their middle management characters. This Oscar nominated movie is a box office success because it is both an entertaining story and a contribution to popular American culture.",

Personally, I find that a bit dull, but since their goal was solely to tell a story that was a \"dramatic view of the 1960s set very much in the real world\" they did an excellent job. It was more than a little disturbing seeing the treatment of people in the 60s. But it was realistic, probably even more tame than the 1960s reality. The story was interesting and needed to be told. I am well-versed in programming, math, science, and space -- and I had no idea. There is media attention on this topic now, but I can't help but think it is only because of this movie and not because the world finally decided to give proper credit. As an IT professional, I thought it was interesting how they showed the beginnings of NASA's IT department. I will say that if NASA really was as bumbling as the movie depicted, that is pitiful and I am shocked they got off the ground. The mainframe couldn't fit through the door and they couldn't even turn it on once they got it in place. The geniuses in the genius room were largely not and their constant changing of requirements was just begging for errors to be made. NASA has come a long way since this movie, I will say that.",

It is well-paced and offers a relatively good balance between the characters' personal lives, their professional lives, and the civil rights issues surrounding them. However, some moments are overlooked or simply overshadowed. For example, Katherine's wedding is a fleeting moment that was built-up throughout the film, but the expectations for this scene were not met. Some character arcs, such as Stafford's treatment of Katherine, have little room to be fully developed. There is a lot happening in the film, which provides depth but also detracts from some of the subplots. Overall, \"Hidden Figures\" is definitely a feel-good movie. I found myself smiling and cheering with the small victories, and despite taking place in the 60s, it remains strongly relevant.",

Her job is to check the work of other people in the group, but she can't see all the information so she can't check their work efficiently and Paul Stafford is a jerk about it. When she figures out why the Atlas rocket didn't get high enough she got yelled at because the calculations she used were classified and blacked out with a Sharpie. She leaves at the same time everyday to go to the bathroom and she gets yelled at for that so she yells at them because the closest colored restroom is across the campus. \"There are no colored bathrooms in this building, or any building outside the West Campus, which is half a mile away. Did you know that? I have to walk to Timbuktu just to relieve myself! And I can't use one of the handy bikes. Picture that, Mr. Harrison. My uniform, skirt below the knees and my heels. And simple necklace pearls. Well, I don't own pearls. Lord knows you don't pay the colored enough to afford pearls! And I work like a dog day and night, living on coffee from a pot none of you want to touch! So, excuse me if I have to go to the restroom a few times a day.\" She had every right to be angry. The bathrooms that were available didn't have the \"colored\" label on them and it would have been frowned upon to use one that wasn't labeled for her to use. She could've gotten into big trouble and her whole goal was to stay out of trouble. Except when she figured out why the Redstone rocket and the Atlas rocket kept failing because she held the paper up to the light to see what had been hidden from her. She got the answer right so, why did it matter so much that she \"read between the lines\". She got the answer from what she was given, not necessarily what she could see. After she explained why she went to the bathroom at the same time every day, Mr Harrison is seen with a crowbar taking down the colored sign on the bathroom at the west campus. When they finally get to the point of sending someone into space it's her idea to use old math to figure out when exactly to have him do whatever to get back home. Katerine was one smart cookie.Mary Jackson wanted to be an engineer but she couldn't because the white community changed the requirements. She had to take classes at an all white high school and she couldn't do that without going to court. She makes a really good argument when the judge asks her why he should let her go to that school.Dorothy Vaughan just wanted to be supervisor over the West Computing group, but the white manager lady kept declining her application.

I knew before I watched it that there were women at NASA that did a lot of the hard work and never got the credit for it, but I had never heard any individual stories of these women. Watching this movie, I was able to get a taste of what it was like for them and what things they did at NASA.\nThis story is about three African American women: Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan. They all worked at NASA in the 1960's. This movie is featured around the launch and orbit of John Glenn and shows the amazing work that these three women did to help with his launch.\nI never really knew much about this part of history. I didn't know much about the space race, the Cold War, and I didn't know about the hidden figures helping out in the space race. It was amazing to see how smart these women were and how brave they were to fight against unequal treatment of women and African Americans. I don't know if this movie was completely accurate or not, but it did give a shout out to these women and really helped to reveal what they did for NASA.\nThe director of this movie is Theodore Melfi. I have never seen any of his other movies, but he did an amazing job with this movie. The set, the music, the atmosphere of the movie, the character development, helping us to get to know the characters and see their bravery. It was a very well put together movie. The three main actors in this movie are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae. They are amazing actresses! They did a great job acting in that time period and they really brought out the good qualities of the women they portrayed. One of my favorite scenes in this movie is when Mary Jackson goes to court to get permission to go to classes at an all white school to become an engineer. She is just amazing.\nThis movie, again, is one of my favorite of all time. It really makes me proud to be a woman when I watch it and it just amazes me what these women went through. It also amazes me how smart they were. This movie is a great history movie, but it is also a very entertaining movie. I definitely recommend it.",

Three African-American women, Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson also made history by achieving the impossible; they were allowed to use their brains to accelerate the space race and break the stigma surrounding the civil rights movement in America.True stories are often the hardest to depict on the big screen, for the simple reason that you must do the story the justice it deserves. Hidden Figures is not only a fitting immortalization of an awe-inspiring story, it is quite possibly one of the most powerful cinematic experiences one can behold, it is just a shame it was not in existence at the time it was needed.No film can be a success without the triumph of its actors, and this film is no exception. It is rare that you find an actor that can fill a room with their presence alone, it is near impossible to find three in the same film. But Taraji P. Henson (Katherine), Octavia Spencer (Dorothy) and Janelle Monae (Mary) all perform with such ease that they send shivers down the spine.1960s America is not the easiest of sets to compose and yet the production team have managed to create authenticity throughout.

The film is set in 1961, Kennedy at this point is still alive but throughout the film as it progresses throughout the years it moves onto Johnson. Three brilliant African-American women at NASA -- Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) -- serve as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) into orbit, a stunning achievement that restored the nation's confidence, turned around the Space Race and galvanized the world. It is truly an amazing story that I regret not watching sooner. The historical accuracy is near perfect as I myself am an A-Level history student and I am studying American history and I have covered this already and I can say it has done well in terms of historical context. Although the film is highly influenced by Mathematics and Rocket science you do not have to understand it to enjoy the film, although I imagine it would be more enjoyable if you were to be bale to understand and follow along there workings.

The plot of the movie based off of historic figures in the NASA program. Specifically Katherine Johnson, Dorthy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson; theses women were geniuses in their field and made it possible for other African American women to be in important roles. Seeing this movie inspired me to do some more research on the three women. To me they were a force to reckoned with, because they wanted change to make it possible for everyone to be who they wanted. Other civil rights movement movies show the the unfairness of what was going on at the time. I appreciate that because the majority of these films don't sugar coat anything. My favorite scene of this film is an example of this. After coming back from the \"colored\" bathroom, Kathrine Johnson's boss asks her why does it take so long. She replies that she had to go to the bathroom. She adds on that all of the bathrooms in a mile radius of the campus are \"white\". So she has to go across campus to relieve herself, she also says the rules are ridiculous saying that she can't even afford pearls. Because \"colored\" people don't even get paid enough, she continues on venting her frustration on the staff that it doesn't help that they can't even refill a coffee pot because they are too afraid to touch it. This scene hit me really hard because I find what they are doing to her is very ridiculous. I was able to connect emotionally with the movie and I think that's important.

            "content": "I don't know why a lot of people seem to be so threatened by a movie with three African-American female leads, but by the looks of some of these reviews that literally seems to be the case. As someone else already stated, African-American women are hardly ever shown in a positive light on television. This movie showcases the pivotal role that three Black women, Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) played in the NASA space race between The United States and Russia to get the first astronaut out of space, and seeing as how most Black people's roles have been conveniently left out, or erased entirely from our history. This was an important story that needed to be told. Therefore, if you're wondering what the big deal is, that is the big deal!I'm sorry (not sorry) that Kristen Dunst's character was not the STAR of this movie for her fans, but this movie was not ABOUT HER, or for her. Although, it still seems like people are trying to give her some undeserved shine while trying to find a way to deflect some of the spotlight away from the three stars female leads of the movie. Truth be told, her role was mediocre at best. Outside of being snotty and uppity, and not doing it as well as Bryce Dallas Howard in \"The Help,\" she did absolutely nothing that garners any attention. On another note, Kevin Costner, being the veteran that he is, did his thing flawlessly, which was no surprise.However, the real stars here are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae. I have always been a fan of Taraji P. Henson's work, so all I have to say is... IT'S ABOUT TIME! It's about time others started to notice just how talented she really is. I love her role as Cookie Lyon on \"Empire.\" It's just that with the exception of \"Benjamin Button,\" a lot of her roles have been for urban audiences, so I'm pleased that she is finally getting some much- deserved attention. Octavia Spencer proved she was a force to be reckoned with in \"The Help,\" but I must admit that I was less impressed with her role in this movie. That's not to say it's not an important one, but let's be honest, Taraji P. Henson steals the show and has the most screen time, so I'm not understanding her Oscar nomination. I think the Oscars definitely got that one wrong. At the same time, the real break-out star here is Janelle Monae. I was pleasantly surprised by how good of an actress she really is. I am vaguely familiar with a little of her music, but between this movie and her role in Moonlight, I think she may have missed her true calling there as an actress. Janelle was spunky and feisty as NASA's first African-American female engineer.I also appreciate the fact that this movie didn't blow smoke up our rear-ends. I am a Black woman from the South, and The Jim Crows laws of the South were very real. Separation based on race was a key factor, so there is no way those people would have shared a bathroom, coffee pot, swimming pool, or anything else with anybody of African-American descent back in the 60's. To pretend that Black women would even be on equal ground, or even be given an even playing field is not only a distortion of history but an insult to our intelligence. Whether you like it or not, it's our history, that's the way it was, and in some places within Southern states, I can definitely vouch for the fact that it still is. DEAL WITH IT! People seem to have a complicated relationship with the truth. There are certain places where I live where I am not so subtly reminded that people with my skin-tone are not welcomed. I experienced this heavily as an undergraduate in college when White students would look at me like I was an alien. That's why Kevin Costner destroying that sign was not an over- dramatization, it sent a very important message about our mentalities when it comes to something as trivial and petty as using a public toilet. Quite frankly, it's time a lot of people grow up and realize that we are all human beings with our own crosses to bear, and if we want to reach the finish line we must learn to work together, especially if we're all working toward the same common goal. Overall, this was a good movie that told an important story of some very important women. Those women just happen to be Black. If that fact rubs you the wrong way, I suggest you take a long look in the mirror and realize that YOU are the problem. One movie with three African-American leads gaining some positive attention should not be a problem when women of color are not celebrated very often. You can count on one hand how many African-American women have won Oscars over the last several decades until recently starting with Hattie McDaniel. That, my friends, is the big deal.",

It's horrifying to me to think that it took this long for these Black Women to be recognized for their work at NASA, essential work. I live in an area where there aren't many African Americans. I've spent my whole life in a majority Hispanic area. The few African Americans I've met are well educated, sophisticated, etc., they never stood out from everyone else. They were respected in our community. Because I didn't live in those areas with lots of inequality because as I said there aren't many African American people living here, I didn't see the inequalities still going on today. Watching this movie opened my eyes a little wider to what I already knew was going on back then but it's also opened my eyes to what's still going on now. I started to notice that in movies, unless they're major stars, African Americans still play the bad guys or they play the servants, in the majority of the case. There's still such a large bridge to gap in this world to gain equality. We haven't come far enough from the 1960's when the events of this film were occurring to today. It's perhaps not as overt in some ways as it was then but this movie did open my eyes to a lot that was going on in this world that I never noticed before.",

You can tell he is prejudice towards women and Black race or black woman. But then if you were an engineer with his experience, would you like someone you don't know checking your work? I believe this is where problems have there root.-Lack of understanding of the whole issue. Was it Mary Johnson who petitioned the court to lt attend class to advance her degree. There was no ugliness their just fact! Fact that had to be overcome, and she did so with fact. Pointing out to the Judge his 1st, were he 'overcame'. The era that the movie was based on was full of Hate and misunderstanding. In my house I had a family member who was a member of a southern club called Kue Klux Klan. He had some strange Ideas and concepts, misunderstandings all of which could have been cleared up had he asked questions, read the correct resource materiel, but he didn't. And life was strange because of it. Paul Stafford overcame his issue due to a common goal issue. Get man to space. At first he had a difficult time realizing there was someone smarter than him, not just someone, but a woman who was black! At times he demanded his role as an educated white male be recognized-worshiped. But when put in his place (when Kathryn out shined him in the board room-his place, his domain)he reluctantly accepted! The move hits us with the urgency of the space age, informs us that in the Ivy towers there was misunderstandings about race and mankind's place in life. However know this, knowledge makes us equal! Gear-heads get together and no mater color of skin or accent they speak with they are all talking motors cars and how to do this and that with a wrench. Hidden Figures point this out! It takes a day or two. But for the sake of the mission Let us realize our differences, recognize similarity and get the Mission finished! Paul Stafford eventually figured it out. Now let us watch the movie and see else we learn!",

            "review_title": "A Winning Film about Maths, Black Women and the Right Stuff",
            "content": "If you're going to make a film that honours the contribution of people to rational hard science, you have to respect hard science, and one sure thing is that it has always been global, and that engineers and scientists have always found it at least necessary to pay proper due to those who achieve in their field. Of course newcomers have always invited derision, but those who succeed win the approbation their peers.Thus NASA became a social opinion leader as well an engineering pioneer, and even in Langley, Virginia, where segregation was a way of life, winning the Cold War demanded full, effective participation and utilisation of the available talent, as any economist would endorse.The biggest negative with this film - and this portrayal was as accurate and intended as the cinematography and corridor shots that deliver it - is that it reminded me too much of the worst side of being at work, where people hold themselves still and aloof, seldom say what they think about you, especially to your face, and create lots of alienated tension.The other side of work is that, as relationships develop and trust builds, people do break this down and even mathematicians can learn to enjoy each other's company - outside of work, even. Unfortunately we don't see this in Hidden Figures at all: the 3 black women come to the film in a delightful, but fully-developed, socially-dependent relationship, we see none of it at all from the white people, and over the course of two hours nothing develops. The closest it gets is when Octavia Spencer rebuffs the hopelessly stilted Kirsten Dunst's approach of, roughly, 'despite what you think I do see things from your point of view' with 'I know you think you do.' There is no prospect of release from the remorseless imperatives of employment, and certainly no hope for humanity here! How about some real human stories, then? Did the Civil Rights movement and the promise of a modern rational society really spring from an animal that behaves like this? Could neither faction FEEL what it's like to be trapped in being the other? When one is cut will the other never bleed, nor when one tickles will the other never laugh? I find the cold consequences of a life like this render the gains of the oppressed frankly futile, and whilst the stories of the women are momentarily uplifting, they seem destined to be dashed by the failure of all to imagine what it is to be a whole society. Thus we have darkness at midday, and I wanted to implore our mathematicians to 'think we are already there,' too, as Costner implores Taraji Henson to do about the Moon.We also have Costner's motivational speech on why the US is coming second in a race with two competitors. Since they're not smarter than us, and they don't want it more than us, we mustn't be working hard enough. Now that's a great starting point for a plot development in the world of science and engineering but, in the best traditions of Redneck America, it's just taken as a given. After all, whilst there probably is a direct, if not linear relationship, within quite wide limits, between desk hours and achievement for a human computer, the same does not hold true for an applied mathematician seeking the new insights Costner is imploring. Thinking creatively to find new methods, new approaches and new solutions does not necessarily require the cancellation of home life and, ironically, that is perhaps the problem any insurgent workgroup has in making real inroads into the incumbent dominant class - finding the recreational space to develop ideas. Burlington Burtie plays at maths and has insights in the bath, whilst the oppressed are too often too tired, working to survive, or to save us from the Commie threat, to think much at all.Actually, it turns out that the solution to coming first in the Cold War was about freedom to be diverse, and think, interact and act, the freedom that allowed Thomas J Watson Jnr to develop IBM into a great computer, that encouraged Noyce, Moore and the modern entrepreneurs to express their exuberance in ever more valuable components, and that motivated graduates and their professors in their thousands to think a thousand thoughts around every open challenge. So it's a pity that we couldn't have Janelle Mon\u00e1e delivering an inspirational soliloquy rather than just the rhetorical devices she uses on the Judge to persuade him to let her go to engineer night-school, and rather than the white man leader who does declaim all the idea fertilisation.In short, dear filmmaker, make your characters CONNECT with each other so that your audience can follow their journey and connect with them.Also, every minute of run time over 90 needs justifying, and there isn't enough to say about Euler's method and the elliptical to parabolic transition to justify all the extra 35 here, which unnecessarily left some of my party seeing themselves already at the exits. Convincing the Western masses that maths is a chat topic is tough enough anyway, without pushing it.And where were the white women? Women have always made excellent computers and computer programmers, and they were not absent from NASA. This audience mostly doesn't know who Grace Hopper was either.But having got all that out of the way, Hidden Figures is (and are) revelatory, charming, often slick, crowd-pleasing and profitable so, for all that could be improved, this is rightly a winner.",

My favorite scene from the movie was when Kevin Costner ripped apart the colored bathroom sign. I think that it was a powerful message to all the people. I liked the entire movie. I liked how it gave a powerful message to girls and women and the impact that we can make in this world. It also put in many years into a one period timeline. I watched this movie in the movie theaters it was a great movie. I would also recommend to my friends. Overall a great movie 1000000000/10",

The fact that it is based on a true story makes me more anxious to keep watching. All of the actors did an amazing job especially the main 3 Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae, and Octavia Spencer. I'm not into long movies but this is one that I couldn't stop watching. It touches on real life situations that people still go through till this day. I love how it shows the actors trying to adjust to everything, and then them excelling and being appreciated for what they do. I will definitely be watching this movie again.",

They tell us the basics of the person's life to get to the point in their lives that would be considered historical. But in this movie you saw so many different perspectives and so much of each one of them. And How they dealt or tried to deal with each one of their situations. I also loved how the music really helped the emotion or just the vibe emphasize the scene on a different level. And honestly I tend to see that in a lot of historical movies with women there is usually a love interest that I feel steals the thunder from what is the main point of the story. But even though there was one in this one I feel that if it was really well put together that it truly didn't take away too much attention. In other words it took away enough attention and kept the main point pretty out there. And so I can't say much hate wise in this movie at all.",

            "content": "Even after laws change in courts or congress, it takes a while for public habits, social rules and workplace policies to adapt. Hidden Figures chronicles the achievements of three intelligent ladies who were courageous to challenge the social order while also making long lasting contributions to science and technology.Segregation was deemed unconstitutional as early as 1957, at least in schools, but it is baffling to believe that while United States was trying to put a man on the moon, had separate bathrooms, bus benches and dining areas for colored people well into the 1960s. Hidden Figures wonderfully captures the hardships of three colored women in those days, while proving how a common goal can help people set-aside differences, break down barriers and achieve the impossible \u2013 something we all strongly need right now.It was cheerful to hear punchlines like \"At NASA, we all pee the same color\" by Kevin Costner or \"Every time we have a chance to get ahead, they move the finish line.\" by Janelle Monae; dialogues certainly being one of the best features of this film. Mahershala Ali beautifully portrays a military colonel who falls in love with a widow. Jim Parsons fits the mold of a math genius but it will take some time for audiences to not expect humor from him, his impeccable gift of timing remains unexploited in the movie. Octavia Spencer, Taraji Henson and Janelle Monae pay a tribute to Dorothy Vaughn, Katherine Johnson and Mary Jackson through their authentic and sincere performances.While the movie provides these ladies their due credit, and the audiences a happy ending, our reality today is far from it. Unfortunately, over forty years after the civil rights movement and numerous laws passed, large parts of our society still openly deny a woman her right to choose, working parents their right to maternity leave, immigrants a wage they deserve, gay couples their right to get married, and a black person his right to a fair trial. We don't want our future generation to say, 'how were they OK with this?' There are hidden figures all around us, let's not wait to appreciate them until the next movie is made. Keep dreaming, try harder, fight for your rights and never give up",

As usual with movies \"based on a true story,\" however, I researched the validity of the facts and was disappointed to learn that the movie had severely exaggerated the racism at NASA. In a post-movie interview, the key star of the film explained that she did not feel much racism while working at NASA. Specifically, she shared the white ladies restroom next to her office and the same coffee pot as everybody else in her group. Further, the nasty fellow who constantly attacked her never really existed. Although I laud the bringing to the public awareness these important black women and their roles in the Space Program, I am sadened to see it done in a manner which exaggerates the racism for modern audiences who will not likely verify the historical accuracy on their own.",

Next scene shows the car broke down and Dorothy slides out and says, \"just as I figured, the starter is bad\". They hear a siren and a cop car pulls up. It is a state trooper driving a 1964 Ford. I am sure lots of people don't know car years and models apart but that cop car was strike one.He asks them if they need help and Dorothy says I think we have it under control. So she reaches backhand and without looking under the hood with a screw driver and sparks fly. The engine comes to life with the sound of a perfect V8 muscle car. The 57 Chevy has a visible 6 cylinder motor.The entire premise is wrong because a running car does not stop running because of a bad starter. You can short the solenoid and starter screws to crank the engine from under the hood if the starter is not bad, but must lean and reach low because the starter is attached to bottom of the engine block and bell housing of transmission.The story of this film is important as far as the telling of how bad segregation was. It may have tried to tell how hard it was for women in general to find technical or management work. Even though affirmative action had barely began in 1961, Dorothy could threaten to strike with 30 women because she was not promoted/titled supervisor. But look how long it took her to get the bathroom situation changed. I believe the women were good at math but just a bit too much super heroics.There are other places in the movie as well with wrong cars. The movie ends with John Glenn's first US orbit around the earth in Feb. 1962. In another scene Kathrine and Levi are going on a date. Levi is driving a turquoise 1964 Mercury Comet convertible.This film was a big financial success from the $25 million budget to the almost $170 million as of June 2017 from its release date of Dec. 2016. It seems to me that if you want to tell a story about smart women (or anyone) who had to overcome hardships and that are supposed to be based on true events, the technical director should do better research. The writer of the book may have gotten the starter part wrong because of hand me down stories. I rated it a 7/10 for the multiple technical errors.",

It isn't one of those feel good films which is bitter sweet with its message - it is pure happiness and relief in the point it is trying to convey.The inspiration women portrayed in this historical drama are played perfection by the leading ladies. Taraji P Henson's best performance, without a doubt\nOut of the main three, her story is executed brilliantly and fully carried by Henson. Certainly Oscar winning deserving!It feels almost unnecessary to make any comments on either Octavia Spencer or Janelle Moane as they as both always captivating, of course, neither are any different here. A special mention must go to Kirsten Dunst, her screen time is limited, but her role is pivatol, Dunst manages to make an outstanding impression in the time she had, making an impression against the remarkable leads is certainly a win for her.Unlike many films similar to this, the story focuses on the central woman and their achievements, instead of focussing on the people who knocked them back. Solid script work allows some focus on those people but does not allow it to outshine the true meaning behind it. This is what gives it such an incredibly heart warming feel.As this is a film centering around NASA, it was inevitable space scenes would be featured, however, this high of quality effects was not expected. Firmly impressed on this front.It isn't perfect though, it is unfornante but on many occasions I found Jim Parson's to be utterly infuriating. I cannot conclude whether this was intentional or whether the matter of the fact is, Parson's is suited to the smaller screen, but it just did not work.",

To me, those racism and sexism in the movie were very subtle and almost nothing. Those subtle discrimination happens even among the same race and the same gender today's workplaces. Probably NASA was far more sophisticated workplace even in those days, so the racism and sexism were not that ugly. In 21st Century, there are still many women who could not have things three colored women in the U.S. had had in 60s. Those three women drove to work and had a job in their field they studied in universities. Today, there are many women who cannot do either of them. On the other hand, I like to see the way those women handle discrimination and racism. They never raised their voices and spoke up with their courage. I am also impressed with those white people who listened to them and changed their opinions even though they grew up with a certain beliefs about people from different races. Those two educated group of people work together because they are in NASA. If they worked at Walmart, they would act differently and things would be uglier.",

This movie shows us a reality of women through 1935. The fight against segregation, and the social and civil rights of every woman in the country. It may seem that the movie talks about a racial profile, when we may be missing the point; it is about women fighting for their rights and stepping up in the study of exact mathematical sciences that are very much needed in the world, specially at NASA. Women's rights and segregation were fought for at the same time. NASA held women as assistants, secretaries and secondary help in the great enterprise of sending a man to space and back. This step in humankind united all kinds of people with all their talents to make the impossible, possible. To reach for the stars is a dream they conquered. At that time it was something crazy, literally, out of this world.

But i love how they did not show white women struggling, it was more about how the african american women are not to be put down in any way. They're extremely intelligent, just as anyone else would be if they put effort into it. I knew that african americans were being discriminated against, but considering them working in the same building i didn't think they'd still have it be segregated. It definitely wasn't a harsh movie about segregation, but they did speak up on it and managed to get the \"colored only\" signs out in the workplace. The director of this movie is Theodore Melfi. Hidden figures is the only movie i've watched that was directed by Theodore Melfi. It was a really good movie though, i may start looking into more movies he's directed.

This movie is based on real people who were working for NASA and the struggles of their daily life. This part of history was going through controversy on equality and racism. I really enjoyed this movie and I think that if people want to see a really enjoyable movie with some history in it, this one would be a really good one to watch. I have seen this movie before out side of school and i really enjoyed it and would recommend this to friends and family. I also liked when they got their dream jobs at NASA because of the skill they had and how they took chances.",

Many of the scenes have been embellished to promote those agendas, and do not reflect historical truth (see Wikipedia discussion), such as the \"colored bathroom sign\" scene, and the \"control room scene,\" in which they invite Katherine in to observe the launch. While, the racial and gender biases portrayed, obviously did exist in the 50's & 60's in some parts of the country, some were natural extensions of the societies that existed at the time (e.g. state of natural families and the roles of the members (fathers and mothers) of those families, typical gender roles at the time, etc.). However, if you can get past the manipulation\u0085 it is a great movie\u0085 and\u0085 it does tell a bit of history\u0085 which, previously appears to have been ignored.",

It was also a time when the U.S.A was strife with change regarding human rights and the fight for equality for black people and women. The movie is set during the Seven Orbit Flight and looks at the story from the point of view of three brilliant, strong black women who worked at NASA. (True story, by the way!)To anyone who thinks that this movie might be \"heavy handed\" by portraying the majority of the white characters as racist, would be wrong. It's not \"heavy handed\" when it's based on truth. In the background of such an uplifting story are reminders of segregated bathrooms, bus seating and schools, and police discrimination - which is unfortunately an issue to this day. Among these strong reminders of racial discrimination,there are also subtle reminders such as when Mrs. Mitchel's character uses Dorothy's given name while Dorothy must call her \"Mrs. Mitchel\".Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) is a gifted math genius, mother of three, and widow who must cross colour and gender roles. She is promoted to the task force that does the math for the launch and re- entry for the space shuttle mission. Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) works in the computing section of NASA as an \"unofficial\" supervisor. She learns that with the installment of the IBM computer she and her coworkers may be replaced, and endeavors to make sure that doesn't happen by educating herself and the computing staff on how to use the IBM. She was considered to be one of the most brilliant people at NASA at that time. Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) also works in the computing department, with dreams of becoming an engineer at NASA, but must jump racial hurdles in order to move forward with that goal. She is by far the sassiest of the three ladies. Mary Jackson became NASA's and The U.S.A's first female African-American aeronautical engineer.The take away message is, of course, that no matter your skin colour or gender we are all equal; we should be given equal opportunities and everyone deserves respect. The linked take away is that if people set aside their perceived prejudices they will achieve great things.My favourite quote: \"Three negro women are chasing a white police officer down the highway in Hampton, Virginia, 1961. Ladies, that there is a God-ordained miracle.\"My second favourite quote: \"You sir. You are the boss. You just have to act like one.\"",

There is next to NO creative cinematography (though there was a neat filter trick that gave a real 60s feel to one scene). But the biggest issue is that it feels like it was actually a really short film, with about 20 minutes of pointless cut thrown in. (Potential SPOILER)-There are literally 5 scenes of her running to the toilet even though it doesn't really add up to much. A scene makes song and dance over a shoe getting caught in a vent, even though it only got a little giggle and added 5 min to the run time. Aside from the negative, the idea IS good and there were one or two moments where the whole cinema burst out laughing and scenes that did have emotion and I just wish there was more of that.",

Gut wrenching to imagine how people lived those days in extreme discrimination. Awesome performance by Octavia Spencer as well - carries her head throughout the movie.

            "content": "'Hidden Figures' is a biopic detailing the untold stories of three inspirational African-American women who served a vital role in NASA during the early space programs. At the beginning of the film, they are working in a segregated environment where their full talents are being under- utilised despite all being clearly very intelligent. The film details their work for NASA and their plight into getting their desired role in helping the early space missions. The film is directed by Theodore Melfi who directed 'St Vincent', a 2014 comedy with Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy which received positive reviews. The film boasts an impressive cast comprised of Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00c3\u00a1e as the titular figures and the cast is rounded out by Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons and Mahershala Ali to name a few so the performances should be very strong. 'Hidden Figures' has received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress for Octavia Spencer and Adapted Screenplay and although it ultimately didn't win anything, many anticipated it as a dark horse in the Oscar race.'Hidden Figures' is an extremely easy film to like and barely puts a foot wrong; I was utterly charmed by it the whole way through. It is competently directed by Melfi and has just the right blend of comedy and factual drama in it to prevent it from being too laborious or too comedic. Not only are the performances are great in this film, but the characters are all really well- developed and the screenplay by Melfi and Allison Schroeder is wonderfully written. What stops this film from being perfect is it is fairly conventional in parts and there are a couple of story arcs that are a little underwritten. But these are very small nitpicks in an otherwise near-perfect film.I really admire the respect that Melfi seems to have for these characters and it's refreshing to not only see a film that is not only led by women, but women of colour. It sets itself very confidently in time, establishing a well-developed context which helps the audience to further empathise with the film's characters and their struggle in a racially segregated society. The film manages to earn a lot of its moments that it tries to go for in sympathising with the characters and although I wasn't aware of anything to do with this true story before seeing the film, I was fascinated with the narrative it portrays, a story of these hidden figures.The performances of the entire cast in this film are round-the-board very likable. Taraji P. Henson is very respectful and faithful as Katherine Goble Johnson, a mathematician who becomes the first African-American working in the Space Task Group. Octavia Spencer, who has received an Oscar nomination for her performance as Dorothy Vaughan is wonderful and is equally comedic yet all-knowing, who works the job of a Supervisor without being credited for it. Janelle Mon\u00c3\u00a1e plays Mary Jackson who aspires to be an engineer and I've been really impressed with Mon\u00c3\u00a1e who manages to give a second fantastic performance after her wonderful turn in 'Moonlight'. The rest of the cast are all very strong too and it's great to see Jim Parsons in a serious role who proves he isn't just limited to comedic roles. What propels these performances is the wonderful character development in the script and I really felt and understand for most of these characters by the end of the film. The only exception is Mahershala Ali as Jim Johnson, a military officer who romances with Henson's character. Ali's performance is great, as to be expected, but I thought the role was quite underwritten and a bit po-faced and there is a moment late in the film that I don't think the film manages to earn.The score which is scored by Hans Zimmer, Pharrell Williams and Benjamin Wallfisch is subtle and fits into the film well whilst being fairly memorable at the same time. The cinematography by Mandy Walker is competent and economical and the film is very well-edited by Peter Teschner.Overall, 'Hidden Figures' is one of the stronger entries in the crop of Best Picture nominees for this year. It is a timely and important film and has just the right amount of respect for these individuals without overdoing it and feeling like a history lesson. It deserves all the Awards attention that it has received \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Melfi has done a very good job in pacing this film perfectly and a strong, cine-literate script manages to bring out some excellent performances in the well- developed characters played by the cast. I really liked it and the film was completely gripping in its opening moments and never lost me throughout its entire run time.Read this and other reviews on thefilmmeister.com",

            "content": "Hidden Figures(2017) directed by Theodore Melfi, seems like a movie you have to force yourself to watch because you heard it has a great message and is a big equal rights film, but would actually be very boring. Despite this initial view Hidden Figures is actually a fantastic film that keeps you engaged. It has a fantastic cast including Taraji P.Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00c3\u00a1e, that are extremely strong in their portrayal of the characters. Every character is multi dimensional and the film shows the three main characters' home and work lives, which makes the film interesting as usually space and science movies don't fully explore the human side of space travel but Hidden Figures does in a wonderful way. The film has really powerful moments that truly have a message.The film does have moments when it has a bunch of math going on but they make it so you can understand by how they explain it. Even though the math is one of the focal points of the movie the movie does not become bogged down with technical math terms; which helped the film as the math was the focus of the movie without making it boring and hard to understand. The sound track also added to the film as it helped the story along during certain scenes without taking over the scene. The film is definitely worth a watch, not only because it has a great powerful message, and commemorates some strong and smart females that made huge strides and helped shape history; but because it is a fantastic film keeps you engaged from start to end.",

However, as an ex IBM Customer Engineer who serviced a lot of IBM System 360 and System 370 main frames I get picky about computer scenes and was rather amused when Dorothy Vaughan walked into the computer room where the IBM 7090 had just been installed, looked around, walked over to an exposed circuit panel that had a probe from an oscilloscope attached. There was only a flat line on the scope screen, studies the panel for maybe two seconds, then moves the probe to another one of the hundreds of points on the panel, the scope then registers a signal and she says, \"There, it was in the wrong place\". Not being trained on the machine circuity and not even looking at a logic book, (the \"schematic\" of the circuitry) she could not possibly know where to put the scope probe or even know what the signal represented. The probe had nothing to do if the machine was going to work or not. I also noticed that when the computer was operating, there were no flashing light on the console panel as normally would be.",

There were some events in the movie that were not exactly correct. I went to ancestry.com and looked up some information on the women and on interesting thing was that Katherine Johnson's first name on her marriage license with her first husband was Creola. Also Katherine's parents both lived until 1971 and 1974 respectively. It seems to be implied that her mother might have been a widow and had time to watch her kids while she worked. In my research and in the book there is no indication that Katherine's parents ever moved out of West Virginia. Also for the sake on making a mundane story more interesting there is obviously some embellishment of the details going on. Over all this was a great inspirational story. Go see it!

            "content": "Hard work pays off with patience. Life isn't fair and won't be. These are all themes that are prevalent in Hidden Figures. The drama, humor, and suspense intertwined together made it engaging to watch. Theodore Melfi set out to create a film that showed the work it takes to achieve something great as well as to show that there are people who will never receive recognition for what they. There was a hidden meaning in this film. All of the colored people in the film persevered through the unfair treatment they received and worked there hardest even though they knew they weren't going to get recognition for there work. They didn't do it for themselves but to improve the lives of others. They pushed the boundaries for themselves so that their children or grandchildren could experience a better future. They were grateful even for the smallest jobs. When the first computer was installed in NASA, the colored women were a bit discouraged as they knew they were going to lose their jobs. But instead of throwing in the towel they found a way around it. They didn't go crying to someone else for help. They instead realized that someone was going to have to know how to fix/program those computers when they broke. So they learned how to program the computers. They didn't protest about how their life was unfair and they didn't get what they wanted but instead found a solution to their problem. Everything was against their favor but they still found a way around it. This parallels with society today. There are many people rising against social injustices such as oppression of ethnic groups and gender groups. Some people burn buildings/flags because they didn't get their way. Hidden Figures demonstrates an alternative and shows that someone is always suppressed. If you want something you have to work for it. You can't expect anything to be handed to you. This movie needed to come out now so maybe it can help people look for smarter and effective ways to solve their problems and improve society.",

It is about three African-American women working for NASA in the early 1960s. They have to overcome many obstacles from that time period, such as: sexism, racism and discrimination. They are very smart mathematicians, with their IQ underrated by colleagues on a daily basis, due to their skin colour and sometimes, their gender. It shows it's high detail of historical accuracy by an interview on television by Martin Luther King Jr, a news broadcast about an attack on a bus full of coloured people protesting and the police being forced to stop a group of coloured, also protesting. At one part of the movie, Dorothy and her two sons are kicked out of a library, due to them not being in the coloured section. Before she is kicked out however, she manages to steal a book about coding; her job at NASA is working with computers. Historical accuracy is also shown by the names being correct, instead of the creators having no knowledge of this.I knew that the movie was going to enjoyable for me, due to one of the cast members: Jim Parsons. He played the role of Paul Stafford in the movie, and in a television show my brother and I enjoy watching: The Big Bang Theory, he plays the memorable role of Professor Sheldon Cooper. I was correct, making the film all the more enjoyable for me; I knew one of the actors would have been good and would not have failed in delivering his role. I said the same about Tom Hiddleston in my war horse review.The music was made by Pharrell Williams, who is known for his role of making the music for Despicable Me Two. His song 'Happy' reached number one in the music charts in The US, UK, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and nineteen other countries. In the United States, it reached 6.45 million copies sold in 2014.Overall, I would rate Hidden Figures an 8/10, due to the reasons stated above. I would recommend watching it if you are into civil rights, equality, America in the 1960s or NASA in the 1960s. It has a very high rating of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes.Thank you for reading this review of the movie: Hidden Figures by Joshua Naish.",

Also, there is no unit patch on the left shoulder and no ribbons. Since a Colonel would have some ribbons, even if just the National Defense which is given to everyone. No nametag as the Army wears a name tag on the right pocket. At least splurge for a few ribbons, they are cheap. A complete omission of attention to detail.

As African Americans, they shatter the barrier of entry to the hallowed halls of NASA, one of the crown jewels of the military industrial complex. As women they shatter the boys club of aerospace and rockets, where females were generally relegated to secretarial or clerical roles. Again as women, they shatter the upper echelons of scientific cliques, where many advanced subjects and challenges were deemed too difficult for females to undertake. This story needs to be told and retold. \nI literally cringed at the harsh treatment that these women faced in the bigoted time circa 1961. It seems the white establishment went out of their way to insult and humiliate their fellow African Americans, who showed amazing restraint and grace. It is quite alarming that a vast segment of America wants to return to this era, to put \u2018minorities in their place', but thankfully that clock will not be rolled back any time soon.\nIt takes incredible courage to be the first, the pioneer and the vanguard, to pierce the veil of discrimination and shove your way into the room. The bravery of these women is exemplary and admirable through the ages. A must see movie to understand the cruelty of the past, and the possibilities born from courage and ambition. To me the historic space missions were a side story, the real subject was the journey of these strong, brave ladies of NASA.",

And some supporting roles are several people conflated into a single representative character but the lead roles are played so brilliantly and the story developed so seamlessly that these can all be overlooked. Your emotions are played like a harp and yet it never feels as if the movie-makers are actively trying to pluck on heartstrings; they're just telling a story and you're along for the ride.

            "content": "As well intentioned as this film is I don't find it to be a film that adds anything new to the traditional formula of the race relations drama with the prestige of being based on a true story. This certainly presents African-Americans in a far better light than the similarly condescending The Help (2011) but all of the clich\u00e9s are still there and they aren't particularly entertaining. I can't see why this film was nominated for Best Picture when it is so milquetoast and boring, I suppose the Academy do love that, and when it is going up against competition like Manchester by the Sea (2016) and Arrival (2016).\n\nAfrican-American mathematicians Katherine G. Johnson, Taraji P. Henson, Dorothy Vaughan, Octavia Spencer, and Mary Jackson, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, face racism as they work at the Langley Research Center and attempt to advance the Americans in the Space Race. Johnson begins a romance with Jim Johnson, Mahershala Ali, while facing off against colleague Paul Stafford, Jim Parsons. The women are helped by their white supervisor Al Harrison, Kevin Costner, who attempts to break down the barriers between black and white employees and battle prejudices. The launch is ultimately success due to the hard work of the mathematicians and the women receive recognition for their efforts.\n\nThe problem with the film is that so much of it feels contrived and too much like many, better films we have seen before. Spencer trots out the same old routine that we have seen in countless other films from The Soloist (2009) to Gifted\n(2017) and yet here something seems to be missing as even she seems tired with her sassiness and firm but fair persona. Henson and Mon\u00e1e additionally struggle to inject their characters with any real life as they feel more like symbols than real, human characters even as we see snippets of their love lives and friendship. The writers, actors and the director Theodore Melfi, known for such highbrow fare as St. Vincent (2014), should have tried to add something new to a story that has been told a million times before and for now their workmanlike but unremarkable approach is just not good enough.\n\nThe only element of the film that is really of note is the score which is bright and lively and all of the things that the rest of the film really should be. We understand how empowered these women feel as catchy toe tappers play during scenes in which they make their way confidently through their workplace. In some ways the film reminded me of Working Girl (1988) in these moments as while none of the songs on the soundtrack even come close to rivaling \"Let the River Run\" by Carly Simon. Hans Zimmer is mostly known for his work on Christopher Nolan films and other serious dramas but he gets the cheery tone that this film needs just right and while he could be accused of ripping off Thomas Newman's score in Erin Brockovich (2000). I would happily remove Mica Levi's nomination for Jackie (2016) and replace it with a nomination for Zimmer's work in Hidden Figures.\n\nInspirational films about real life African-American figures that I would recommend watching before seeing this film include Rosewood (1997) and Ali (2001). Those films try to say something interesting about their main characters as we see Mann as a man who is a cause for change but also an overly violent man while we see what an impressive athlete Muhammad Ali was as well as being a drain on those around him in his personal life. It is disappointing how few films that are not about real African-Americans get wide recognition and I wish that more African-Americans were given opportunities to make films that take more risks than this paint by numbers biopic.\n\nThis is a film that won't offend anyone, to my knowledge, but it won't inspire any great passion in anybody or teach them anything they don't already know. The content of the film is rather boring despite it's worthiness and the performances are not the best of the admittedly talented actresses involved. See Moonlight (2016) or Fences (2016) if you want to see fascinating films that explore the struggles of being African-American.",

It's just so glossy and picture perfect it defies belief, I would've preferred to see something a little closer to reality, none of these characters seem to have a single substantive flaw even. I'm reminded of the film Imitation Game and how Alan Turing was a more interesting character because he was kind o an asshole.\n\nStill, these are minor gripes. I'm confident most people will enjoy this film as I did despite wishing they'd taken a few more risks. The film is worth watching to cement these three women in our collective memories at the very least.\n\n8/10 Stellar",

The real problem is that there are too many storylines and so few time to explore properly all of them. The result is not confusing, there are no rushed parts or plot points hardly comprehensible. The real problem of this is that the movie lose a lot of tension or emotional weight and stays pretty much superficial, with character construction that was simple and basic, nothing more. Also the beautiful messages about racial and gender equity feels superficial because of the poor time to explore them. On the other end the direction and the photography are functional, all the acting performances waere great and the music is suited. In conclusion it is a movie which probably most of the people will like (even strongly) but very few will love or hate (unless you are personally so into its inclusion message).",

            "content": "The 1960s was the age of political movements and changes, which makes it one of the most hectic and violet decades in American history. Hidden Figures, a 2016 drama directed by Theodore Melfi, features the racism and changes the sixties had to offer. Throughout the movie, three African American women break human history by working on NASA\u00e2(TM)s project of getting a man into space while also struggling with racism and gender discrimination in the workplace. They defy all odds against them and become some of the most vital parts of the age of space. Hidden Figures is an inspirational, eye-opening story that can capture anyone\u00e2(TM)s attention. \n\nIn the beginning, the movie emphasizes the inequality the three women, Dorothy, Katherine, and Mary, dealt with in their computing jobs at NASA. After the Russians began making advancements in the race, the Flight Research Division needed Katherine\u00e2(TM)s mathematical specialties for research documents. She started working with white, male mathematicians and engineers and this is where she had the most struggle with racism. She got no clearance, had separated bathrooms and supplies, and was treated with disrespect, yet she kept working until she earned the respect of everyone around her. \n\nDuring this time Mary applied to be an engineer which required her to go to an all-white college during the nights which also presented problems. After graduating from that college, she became NASA\u00e2(TM)s first female African American engineer. While both Mary and Katherine struggled with discrimination in their new fields, Dorothy struggled with getting the raise she deserved. She did the work of a management job, but NASA didn\u00e2(TM)t give \u00e2the colored division\u00e2? a supervisor. This caused her to use her skills to program one of the newest machines to NASA; the IBM machine which was too complicated and could not be programmed by anyone but Dorothy and her workers. \n\nHidden Figures used multiple perspectives and issues to create a clear idea of what life was during this time. It represented the changing of society, gender discrimination, racism, eagerness to discover more, family and love, and the idea of working hard will pay off. It can play with your emotions to form a connection with the protagonists and the victims so easily. If it had less talking and more clarity of some scenes, it would be a better movie for audiences of younger ages. But its maturity and deep scenes make it an extremely watchable film. \n\nThis captivating drama is so appealing to the audience and makes them feel like they\u00e2(TM)re getting a first-hand experience of discrimination. It can be enjoyed by men and women of all interests and almost all ages due to its humor and diversity of characters. It brings the viewers back to a time when discovery, the fight for equality, and family were the most important things to everyone.",

The Space Race was a competition between between the Soviet Union and The United States, during the cold war, to see who could reach space first. The United States \"won\" the race, but not everyone who helped is recognized. Hidden Figures is a film directed by Theodore Melfi, about three black women who worked behind the scenes to make sure John Glenn (Glen Powell) would get safely launched into space. These women were Katherine Johnson (Taraji Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e). Hidden Figures shows the true story of these three women and their battle against racism and sexism to be in the STEM field. Although it is an inspiring story, it doesn't tell the full truth.\nThe movie did tell the true stories of the three women and the NASA space launch. The three women all persevered to achieve their dreams. They worked as computers at the beginning of the movie, but all slowly worked their way to their dream jobs. Katherine Johnson was an extremely talented mathematician who ended up working with white men to calculate the correct landing spot for the Freedom 7. Mary Jackson is an aspiring engineer that struggles to work in her own field. Dorothy Vaughan runs the black computers and learns the code for the new IBM computer (IMDb). It shows the classic \"anything is possible\" kind of moral. \nThe movie in of itself wasn't terrible, but it was not fully historically correct. Many things happened in the movie that did not happen in real life. The film exaggerated the racism, by adding scenes that were not true, but made the plot and or movie more interesting. For example, many times we see that Johnson has to go across campus to use the colored restrooms, but this is untrue and did not really happen. So by Hollywood making the movie more dramatic, it made the movie less historically accurate. The characters also lacked depth and complexity. Most had one defining characteristic. For example, we notice that Jackson is sassy, and that is her defining characteristic (Oclese). It also is mainly focused on Johnson's story, even though ll of their stories are interesting, and all had the same determination to achieve their dreams. \nEven with all of the things that were inaccurate, it doesn't mean that the movie was necessarily bad. It was still a great, inspiring film. This film is great for most age groups, the youngest probably around twelve. It is great for anyone to see this and be inspired, especially young women children. It is important for people to see that being prejudice, rasict or sexixst will not and can not stop anyone.",

Hidden Figures, directed by American screenwriter and producer Theodore Melfi, illustrates the experiences of African American women Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Johnson during the 1960s. Based on a true story, the three women worked at NASA, serving as the brains behind one of the most monumental operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit. This remarkable achievement restored the nation's confidence, turned around the space race, and galvanized the world. The protagonist, Katherine Johnson, was the first of the trio to work at the NASA space test group because she was incredible at mathematics. Throughout the film, the visionary trio battles with not only personal affairs but the harsh realization of segregation and gender inequality throughout the workplace. Hidden Figures is a fascinating and inspiring film that keeps the audience enlightened and engaged.\n\nKatherine Johnson gets the opportunity to join the big leagues, where decisions are made, and she can finally explore her talent in mathematics. Unfortunately for her, she struggles through tough times along the way. No 'colored' men had ever been selected to join the test group, let alone 'colored' women. Katherine had to use a separate empty kettle for her tea and to \"relieve herself,\" she had to travel half-a-mile away to a building that had the appropriate restroom for her. Despite all of these challenges, her brilliance in mathematics made sure she shined the brightest among her white male colleagues. The three female mathematicians and physicists, also known as 'human computers,' were some of the most substantial brains behind NASA greatest accomplishment. As Katherine Johnson was out working at the space test group, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson were out making their dreams come true. Dorothy battles with her condescending boss, Vivian Mitchell, to become the supervisor in NASA's West Area Computing division, and Mary takes to the court in an attempt to become the first female African American engineer. \n\nTheodore Melfi does an outstanding job of keeping the plot easy to follow while also portraying emotion. Even though overcoming challenges is an all-too-familiar topic, Hidden Figures manages to tell an inspiring story. In one of the last scenes of the film, John Glenn commands that he will not complete his mission on orbiting the earth unless Katherine Johnson checks the numbers. He says, \"Get the girl to check the numbers\" and \"If she says the numbers are good, I am ready to go\" (Hidden Figures). This is an inspiring moment in the film because it shows how Glenn trusts Katherine calculations, despite her being an African American women, and this could mean the difference between life or death for him. Glenn saw the brilliance in Katherine and knew the potential she had.  \n\nHidden Figures is a fascinating film that tells an inspiring story. Theodore Melfi illustrates the experiences of three African American women overcoming segregation and gender inequality not by violence and protest, but with skill and persistence. The film teaches the audience not to judge a person by the color of her skin, but by her character and the knowledge she owns. People ages ten and up who love history and are interested in an inspirational plot should watch Hidden Figures.",

Hidden Figure is a movie directed by Donna Gigliotti. It takes place in the 1950s, and it takes a glance at what it was like to be an African American woman working for the NASA program. This movie showcases three African American women who take on the endeavors of working for NASA and the racial bias that they encounter. Hidden Figures was an eye-catching, storytelling movie. However, it lacked a real sense that others movies have.\n   Early in the movie, the director did an excellent job at capturing the viewer by adding Katherine\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s childhood and how she became a mathematician.  The protagonist, Katherine Harrison, started her life from humble beginnings. When she was young, she was a math prodigy and was accepted into some of the best schools in the country. Twenty years later,  Katherine became one of the only few African Americans working for NASA. Katherine was one of the best mathematicians at NASA, but many of her white counterparts did not want to recognize her abilities. She was one of the only African Americans working at NASA that had a significant impact on the space program.   \nKatherine occupied one of the highest paying jobs at NASA, predicting rocket trajectory. During her time there, many of her white counterparts did not believe that she had the capabilities to be there. Furthermore, they felt that she was inferior to them. The movie does a great job of capturing the viewer and getting them interested in the plot. The film mainly captures Katherine\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s side of working at NASA and did a great job portraying the overt racism that was seen in the workforce. Although the movie was detailed and right to the point it lacked in some areas, such as it did not feel realistic. Harrison was asked a question about her time working in NASA, and she said she never experienced racism. The premise of this movie is based on the issue of gender bias and bigotry. The fact that she stated that she did not experience racism makes the film inaccurate.\nAlthough this novel creates acknowledges what it was like to be an African American women in the 1950s, it was inaccurate in its storytelling. These young women did the unthinkable during this time by and becoming some of the best African Americans women working at NASA. This movie shows that success can be achieved through the roughest of times even when gender bias and racism are not in their favor. This was a fascinating film that would be great for adolescents and adults. It would not appeal to children under the age of 12 because it would be hard for them to understand the racism aspect of the movie. \n\n\n\n\tRating: 4.5/5",

A second prejudice existed against women in the scientific/engineering space program at NASA. This movie is about three outstanding women who wanted to make a difference in their community. Katherine Johnson, the main character, worked on the calculations that allowed John Glenn to orbit the earth. This was a fascinating movie, and it proved that women during this time were capable of achieving goals that were only assigned to men. It was even harder for African- American women to succeed.\n\tKatherine Johnson, a brilliant mathematician, was selected to join the space test group because she was one of the few individuals who knew how to apply analytical geometry. Although she experienced many challenges, for example, Katherine was asked to examine and check her male coworkers math calculations. Her male coworkers decided to black out this information by telling her it was classified. She overcame this problem by holding the paper up to the light. Also, when Katherine wanted a cup of coffee on the first day of her new job, she had to use a separate coffee pot because of segregation. Finally, when Katherine had to use the bathroom, she would have to run to the other building where all the African American women worked to relieve herself. Katherine\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s boss later tore down the bathroom sign because he believed that African- American women should be equal, and he didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t want her to waste valuable calculation time running back and forth to use facilities every day.  \n\tThe title of the movie is Hidden Figures; this was interesting because the African- American women who worked at NASA were \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2hidden Figures\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? during the 1960s. These three main women were the hidden keys for success. This film was fantastic and was written about prejudice and segregation which is still a problem that needs to be resolved to this day. More truthful information about the contributions of these dedicated women would have inspired and benefited young girls of all colors to study math, science, and engineering. Katherine Johnson and the other two women strived for what they believed in. This inspires all of us, and all ages (school age and up) should see this movie.",

Katherine Goble is a genius mathematician who is promoted from being a computer to working with white men to calculate the landing point for John Glenn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s spaceship. Mary Jackson is an engineer who dreams of working on the shuttle but must win the right to attend night school so she can learn the necessary skills. Dorothy Vaughan is the unofficial supervisor of the African-American computers who strives to be recognized with the title and pay of a supervisor.  The three women have to defy stereotypes to win their co-worker and bosses\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM) approval and achieve their dreams.\nThe movie was engaging and inspiring in multiple ways. One of the most impressive parts of the film is how real footage from the Friendship 7 launch in 1962 was used (Scubafiend). The historical accuracy added some extra detail to the movie and made it more enjoyable to watch. Also, the use of symbolism in the lot, such as the \u00ef\u00bf 1/2pearl necklace\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? that Katherine Goble does not own, added an extra layer of depth to the script (JRS). The three women were so inspiring, it would have been tough to create a story that does not demonstrate their perseverance and strength. The movie had a clear message and anyone would be in awe of Goble, Vaughan, and Jackson\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s accomplishments after watching it.\nWhile much of the Hidden Figures story is true to real events, many of the details were made up by Hollywood to make the plot more appealing. One of the most memorable parts of the movie occurs when Katherine Goble has to run to the \u00ef\u00bf 1/2colored\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? restrooms across the NASA campus every day, but this is fictional, as are the characters of  Al Harrison and Paul Stafford to show the racism and sexism of the time (JRS). Also, the characters in the movie are slightly one-sided and do not have many personality traits (Olcese). These women were geniuses, and do not deserve to be portrayed as any less. Finally, the movie focuses mainly on Katherine Goble story. Although it was possibly the most interesting, it made it seem that Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson did not work as hard as she did to achieve her dreams, when all three women were extremely perseverant (Olcese). If one is looking for a more historically accurate version of Hidden Figures, they should read the book Hidden Figures by Margot Lee Shetterly.\nHidden Figures had an inspiring moral and was entertaining to watch. Although some details were made up, this was done to make the storyline more interesting, and photos of the real people behind the stories were shown at the end of the movie. While the message to \u00ef\u00bf 1/2never underestimate others\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? is clear, the story could have had more complex characters and gone more in-depth with Jackson and Vaughan\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s stories if it were longer. These women\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s astonishing history is too complicated to be summed up in two hours. Hidden Figures should be recommended to any age group, especially for younger children, because it is important for children to see how unfair discrimination is, and the inspirational message to \u00ef\u00bf 1/2reach for the stars,\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? in this case, literally, are fit for anyone.",

Loosely based on the novel \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2Hidden Figures\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? and actual events, the movie follows African-American NASA (Formerly known as NACA) human computers, Katherine Johnson (played by Golden Globe-winning actress Taraji P. Henson.), Mary Jackson (played by singer, songwriter, and actress, Janelle Mon\u00c3\u00a1e), and Dorothy Vaughan (portrayed by Oscar-winning actress, Octavia Spencer.). The three women face racism and sexism throughout the movie, encouraging others to fight for what they believe in, work hard, and take a stand. The cinematic gem features a star-studded female cast that makes Hidden Figures a true work of female empowerment in Hollywood, changing the movie from decent to excellent.\nThe 2016 historical fiction movie highlights the racism and sexism of the 1960s. The main three characters, Katherine, Mary, and Dorothy, know this all too well. Katherine becomes a human computer in the year 1961 in the film and experiences racism as well as sexism in the workplace by the fictional character, Paul Stafford. portrayed by Primetime Emmy-winning actor Jim Parsons. Stafford is Katherine's co-worker, and the two are not the best of friends when she arrives. Katherine is often told that she is not fit to be in her position, a useless employee and among other racist and sexist remarks. Parsons\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM) character \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2shows audiences the symbolism of sexism and racism in the 1950s\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2?. (Hollywood vs. History) The characters portrayal gives us the emotion and depth needed to make Katherine\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s character work harder than before to prove she belongs, giving viewers a real cinematic view of female empowerment. \nActresses, Janelle Mon\u00c3\u00a1e and Octavia Spencer\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s characters are no stranger to discrimination as well. Their characters Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan show the female audience empowerment. Mary Jackson is a female engineer and computer who takes her career to new heights when she goes to court for fighting for something she believed in. When Jackson is denied access to further her education because she is an African American woman, she takes a stand and petitions the court to level the playfield. Janelle Mon\u00c3\u00a1e\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s acting skills in these scenes give audiences the emotion, pain, and triumph needed to make her character embody a pure work of female empowerment. Dorothy Vaughan does the same as well when being chosen for re-assignment. Vaughan faces a difficult decision and must choose between herself and her fellow computers. Vaughan declines the re-assignment and gives her supervisor an ultimatum that she can only take the job if she can bring her equally qualified co-workers with her. This provides fans that female empowerment and diversity element that we need to see more of in Hollywood. Vaughan doesn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t only take the promotion for herself but expands the job to include her co-workers. Vaughan shows viewers that one African American women advancing in the workforce is a great achievement, but multiple African American women moving up in the male-dominated workforce is true female empowerment for all. \nAltogether the Film Hidden Figures is an outstanding film that all ages should watch. The cinematic gem gives audiences a perspective of female empowerment and diversity rather than historical fiction, making it a stellar film for all audiences to enjoy.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures, a 2016 American historical drama film,  depicts the inspiring untold true story of three African-American females working at NASA during the Space Race. The trio immensely contributed in launching astronaut John Glenn into orbit. The movie is loosely based on the non-fiction novel, Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race by Margot Lee Shetterly. Although there are many informative moments throughout the movie, it deviates slightly from the actual historical events.\n\nOne of the essential characters in this story, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), is not a real person. His role is based on Robert C. Gilruth, the head of the Space Task Group at the NASA Langley Research Center (Loff). In Hidden Figures, Al Harrison is not focused on the prevalence of racism in the United States during the 1960s - He, along with many others, is solely concentrated on getting a man into orbit (Krizanovich). \n\nAlong with this, one of the most memorable scenes of Hidden Figures occurred when the Al Harrison smashed down the Colored Ladies Room bathroom sign with a crowbar. This transpires after Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), \"returns to her desk from a bathroom break, drenched after running for half an hour in the rain,\" (Thomas). Though this is a dramatic and substantial scene in Hidden Figures, this did not happen. \n\nA similar misrepresentation occurs in Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race. The novel states that Katherine Johnson \"refused to so much as enter the Colored bathrooms,\" and she was never forced to, either. Dexter Thomas, a VICE news correspondent, interviewed Katherine Jackson herself, who stated: \"I just went on in the white one.\"\n\nAlthough the movie portrays various delusive events, it comprises the reality of controversial topics such as racism and sexism, particularly during the '60s. It also discloses how individuals conquered these adversities.  This movie would most likely appeal to adolescent viewers who enjoy historical dramas. Viewers who are not interested in aeronautics may not find this movie about space science engaging. Overall, Hidden Figures is a wonderful film about self-actualization and resilience.   \n\nRating: 3.0/ 5.0",

            "content": "Being Bold In Life Is Hard\n\nHidden Figures, an incredible, untold, true 1960s historical fiction film directed by Theodore Melfi. This movie shows the progress of three African American women who work at the headquarters for NASA in Hampton, Va. These women are striving to create the most significant space launch in history, the launch of John Glenn into orbit. This film occurs during the time of segregation and workplace sexism was prevalent, but more specifically it tackles African American women's rights. The three African American women's lives the movie follows are Katherine G. Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan. In the film, they were referred to as \"computers,\" as if they are simply machines, not actual people. Hidden Figures was a compelling and moving story; although it did not portray history extremely well, as there is a Hollywood touch added to the movie, and some scenes are not entirely historically correct. \n\nThe movie's main storyline is the division between the two colored skins, the blacks and whites, and how differently they were treated. In the 1960s, the white colored skinned people got treated like they were superior and people with darker skin were considered low-quality. The movie does not portray exactly the real historical events that happened, and some of the most powerful parts in the movie that were added in were not actually true events. Kevin Costner's character, Al Harrison, was not a real character. Three different directors at NASA inspired his character. Al Harrison was a composition character. Another scene in the movie that is false occurred when the white male workers thought Katherine G. Johnson was the janitor there to empty garbage cans. That was not true. That incident never happened. This was an element of fiction created by the filmmakers. Jim Parsons' character, NASA engineer Paul Stafford, was also a fictional character. He was designed into the movie to represent certain racist and sexist attitudes that existed during the 1960s. He then has a change of heart and brings Katherine a cup of coffee later. This character did show how terrible people were back then, and how people can change, but it was not the real events. These scenes are all fiction. While compelling, however, they were not real. \n\nThe most powerful scene in Hidden Figures was Al Harrison knocking down the white women's bathroom and making it a bathroom for everyone, coloreds included, so Katherine did not have to run half a mile to a different wing of the building, occasionally even in the rain just to go the restroom. That is all fake too. Katherine ignored the rules and still used the women's restroom in her wing. This scene signifies the experience Mary Jackson had when she worked for NASA. Also, there is no record of anyone ever personally taking down restroom signs. All these scenes are meaningful and valuable to the story, but leaving them out would have made the story exceptional. Viewers would know the real story and understand what actually happened to those women. Some viewers disagree and like having those fictional characters or scenes in the movie because it gives more examples of what it was like back then. Also, some people believe it captures the struggles of African American women more. Although, viewers should consider that if they want to see the actual battles of segregation in the 1960s, seeing the true story would show more. \n\nHidden Figures is a such a touching movie because it tells the story of how three strong African American women stood up to being kept down. They refused to go unnoticed. They demanded to be seen as equals to their white counterparts. There was nothing easy about what they did, but they did it anyway. Katherine G. Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan are such inspirational women and have set an example for future women to follow. This movie would be recommended more towards women because Hidden Figures is about the struggles women faced, but more specifically African American women. Women would feel very connected to this movie and understand what they are going through.  Even though this movie was so enjoyable to watch, had Hidden Figures followed the original storyline, it would have been exceptional. All being said, this movie deserves a 3.5/5 star rating.",

            "content": "Exaggeration or Excellence\n\nWhat makes a film excellent? Hidden Figures, directed by Ted Melfi, revolves around three black women named Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, and Mary Jackson who worked at NASA and were integral to the success of many of the Apollo missions including the one that sent John Glenn into space, which caused him to be the first American to orbit the Earth. Hidden Figures is a critically acclaimed movie that was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. Hidden Figures was undoubtedly an enlightening movie that captivated its audience, but it also implemented exaggeration to entertain viewers.\n\nFew movies based on true stories maintain the delicate balance of facts and personal struggles like the film Hidden Figures does. The difficult tasks that Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, and Mary Jackson completed while working at NASA would not have been properly represented had the film creators decided to neglect the scientific and mathematical aspects of these women's careers.  Despite the complicated ideas that circulated throughout NASA, Hidden Figures was able to explain the basic function of each of the main character's jobs in simple yet sufficient enough detail so that the audience could appreciate each women's contributions to the space program. This movie induced feelings of inspiration and satisfaction to many of its viewers as it highlighted how Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan overcame various struggles such as sexism and racism to achieve success in their fields. If nothing else, Hidden Figures opened its audience's eyes to the idea that the space program at the highest level was not exclusively run by the white man, and everyone can make an impact in any field.\n\nMovies based on reality are subject to a certain amount of authenticity, and authenticity is one of the major reasons viewers decided to watch Hidden Figures. However, under further scrutiny,  the film Hidden Figures proved to have many inaccuracies. Arguably the most important exaggeration included the idea that Katherine Johnson suffered large amounts of explicit racism while working when in reality Katherine Johnson herself admitted that racism was not prevalent at NASA. Movies based on true stories are held accountable to a certain amount of accuracy, yet the filmmakers decided to add false ideas into the movie to make it more entertaining. There are times and places for artistic license, but it should be used to accentuate details not falsify facts. Developing a plot in a movie of this genre needs to be based on truth, and the film Hidden Figures was not able to meet that requirement.\n\nHidden Figures was an enthralling movie despite using false information to create conflict and entertain viewers. The film showcased Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Katherine Johnson's accomplishments with an appropriate amount of detail. However, the producers detracted from the value of the movie by trying to create a problem that did not even exist. Hidden Figures is the perfect movie for anyone who wants to understand the contributions that these women made to America, but not for those wishing to understand the full, accurate story of their lives. Many people can make an entertaining fictional film, but those who create movies that revolve around the lives of real people need to be held to a higher standard.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is a dramatic historical film that gathers what life was like in the early to mid 1900s for African American women, and how the three protagonists push through discrimination with hard work and bravery, eventually gaining respect as workers in NASA (then called NACA). Despite both African Americans and woman being frowned upon by society, these courageous people fought for civil rights and a place among the workers at NASA, in a mission to reach space and bring an astronaut back home. Hidden Figures, based on a book sharing the same name, being published the year as the movie, has aspects of civil rights and courage that inspires the watchers, however is dramatized from the original plotline.\n\n\tThe protagonists, Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, work as calculators for NASA, being called \"computers\". They would calculate some of the most crucial problems in NASA, though being constantly persecuted for being African American women. Eventually, the main protagonist, Katherine, gets a promotion from computers to work on directly checking and creating equations for NASA to confirm calculations are correct. In the movie, she arrives to her new office area to find that she is the only African American and woman there, with a separate low-quality coffee machine than the others, and only obtaining only censored writings due to \"confidentiality\". This is however different from what the story is based off of. Originally, Katherine actually had minimal discrimination compared to what they had to go through in order to get to NASA in the first place. Still, to make the movie more dramatic, and express the troubles the protagonists had before being at NASA,  they exaggerated NASA's dislike African American women in the movie.\n\nOther than the movies' flaws with being historically inaccurate, there were general themes, such as American hate and suspicion towards the recently launched Russian satellite known as Sputnik, that were fairly accurate a represented how the beliefs from the mid 1900s was different from today. Katherine Johnson, who is still alive at age over 100 years old, stated that \"[The Hidden Figures movie] was well done. The three leading ladies did an excellent job portraying us,\" according to The Los Angeles Times. This shows the movies accuracies with the bravery and courage of the original women at NASA, as can be seen frequently in the movie, such as when Mary Jackson makes a speech to a judge in order to attend an all-white school, one of the only things limiting her from proceeding to become a NASA engineer4.\n\nThe movie was overall entertaining, dramatic, and historically accurate in terms of themes, however being over-dramatized. The original women who worked at NASA were well portrayed, to bring together an inspiring film. The movie earns a well-deserved 4.5/5 stars for historical theme accuracy, entertainment, and being an inspiring tale of the brave women working at NASA.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures:  Discrimination and Determination\nThe Realities of NASA\n\nHidden Figures is a veritable movie, taking place in the early sixties, where three black women were discriminated against their race, and gender in the NASA computers division. The film is well characterized by the actors, with a powerfully written script by the director, Allison Schroeder.  This historical movie is based on the nonfiction book, Hidden Figures, by Margot Lee Shetterly. Although countable events that took place were real, the movie would not have been entertaining without further conflict.  The actors portray the hardships of being \u00e2computers\u00e2? at NASA, and their struggles to fight for civil rights and displayed tough female leads.  \n\nThis well written, award-winning historical movie is no documentary. For example, the three main actors, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Johnson were depicted as being close friends. In the actual story, they were colleagues who supported one's dreams, but they never were close (Schroeder). These untrue events that are claimed to be right continue. For instance, Katherine Johnson\u00e2(TM)s scene when she ran all the way to the African American women\u00e2(TM)s lavatory never happened. Katherine Johnson was not the one running across the branch, Mary Jackson was. Jackson\u00e2(TM)s story of running to a bathroom with a colored sign on it is entirely different from the story.  Johnson had explained that she did not feel discriminated against, even using the white washrooms, (Harris). Also, Al Harrison, the head of the space program, melodramatic scene of hammering the sign in front of the ladies restroom was fictional. It seems as though the director added this dramatized scene  to raise the conflict of the story. Furthermore, without rising action, the storyline would have been disinteresting, and would not have been an award-winning film.\n\nThe three African American women faced many challenges through NASA. The movie depicts how the women were discriminated against in the 1960s. They were discriminated not just by race but by gender. For example, Dorothy Vaughan leads a group of African American women to the mainframe computer room. She saw this as an opportunity for her fellow African American colleagues to advance. This symbolizes the civil rights movement. In this time in history, women mainly worked as receptionists, and their talents for mathematics and science were shut down. Katherine Johnson took her chance and upgraded from being a human computer to working on the mathematics behind the Mercury 7 mission. She was highly discriminated against by her male colleagues. The movie shows a clear image of how Johnson struggled to work in a large room of white men. A clear vision the film tried to explain was the scene where Paul Stafford, a white engineer, forbade Johnson to sit in on a board meeting. Al Harrison, the boss, shut down his sexist and racist comments by allowing her to sit in on the meeting. Johnson even did calculations in front of the representatives and got assigned the Mercury 7 launch. All three of the women have had amazing accomplishments while facing discrimination and the harsh Jim Crow Laws.\n\nThis movie attempts to demonstrate the hardships the African American women endured. Hidden Figures does well to characterize the three astonishing women and their marvelous work. Although it is not historical in the least, the plot appeals to younger audiences (adolescent) as well as older adults. This movie will likely not appeal to history buffs who will not agree with the events that took place. This reason is that the film is not historically correct but still gives a vivid image of segregation. The maturity of this movie is not meant for younger viewers because they may not understand the symbols shown. Overall, this movie is a depiction of what African American women had to do to overcome equality issues and misogyny.",

Katherine Goble Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson were three african american women who were great at both math and problem solving.They contributed to one of the United States most miraculous events when they helped launch John Glenn into space.\n\tHidden Figures is a movie and book based off a true story. When the story was told in the setting of the 1940's, African-American and women were discriminated against in many aspects of their life. Katherine,Dorothy, and Mary were black women working at NASA in the east wing with multiple other black women. That all changed when Katherine was offered a new job in the East wing with all white males. They looked down upon her at first but soon they realized she and the rest of the women would be a key math component in beating other countries in the race to space.\n\tHidden Figures deserves a ? star rating. The quality of the cinematography is outstanding. The way the movie is set in the time period of discrimination but the quality is clear is amazing. The perspective of the opening scene adds onto the star rating. It shows what talents the women have from the beginning and incorporates a sense of discrimination The reason one point was taken off was because of the way the story was told. Most movies don't show the whole plot as there's no enough time but the movie seemed very untrue to the real story. Women were treated unfairly most of the time at NASA but Katherine Johnson did work as hard to achieve a higher position.\nThis film should be suitable for childern to adults ages 10 and up because the themes can not be fully undestanded if the audience is young. This film would also be enjoyable for people interested in African-American history,NASA's history, or interested in learning about discrimination. Hidden Figures is out of this world extrodinary and is worth the time to watch.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures directed by Theodore Melfi is a thrilling experience about two African American women, who worked for NASA in 1961. These women were named Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, and they were part of one of the most inspiring movies to hit the theaters ever. They each had separate jobs, but have to push through the same problems. Katherine's job was to figure out how to make a spaceship go into orbit, Mary's job was to help engineer a spaceship that could sustain high heats and high altitudes, and Dorothy was the supervisor for her group, which she was then the first ever African American to do so. 1961 was a highly racist time, so the three women had to overcome lots of difficult problems such as having to run a long ways to go to the bathroom, and had to drink from a less purified container of coffee. These females also had to work in a separate room and had to deal with the prejudiced coworkers surrounding them. Hidden Figures gives watchers the thrill of overcoming racism while pulling together an astounding story of trying to figure out how to get a spaceship in orbit, and to land on the moon.    \n\tHidden Figures has many aspects of overcoming racism. One aspect is when Caroline first gets promoted to her job for the duration of the movie. Her co-worker, Paul Stafford, seems to be extremely prejudiced throughout the book. Caroline offers to check his work, and he says \"No it is already correct\", and does not let her check it. Also throughout the movie, Caroline is giving information to Paul, and he quickly tells her that it is wrong or outdated, which she goes back to her workspace, and retires at her work, clearly aggravated. In the next scene, Caroline begs Al Harrison, the leader of the NASA group, to let her in the meeting, and tells him that she has the right information, but Paul refuses to let her in the important meeting.  Al overrides Paul and Caroline is let into the meeting. Later in the meeting, her information is finally seen as correct, and useful, and later in the movie, this information helps NASA reach the moon. Another reason that these women had to overcome racism was that of the unfair gender separated bathrooms and coffee dispensers. This is inadequate because often times throughout the movie, Caroline has to run about half a mile in high heels, just to go use the restroom. Because of this, Caroline's work is often delayed and causes her to be yelled at a few times. This is resolved by Al because he knocked down the \"Colored Women\" restroom sign, and declaring that all women will be allowed to use the white women's restroom. This is seen as shocking by readers because, at the time period, many other companies would have not cared about it. Another scene where racism is taken place is when Caroline is riding the bus, she has to sit in the box. Surrounding her are African American people who are protesting for equal rights. During this scene, Caroline and her children are clearly upset about having to sit in the back of the bus, and they dream of a day where they will be able to sit wherever they want. \nTheodore Melfi directed this movie with almost perfection. The overall message is very moving and is an important message to know today. This movie is great for people of ages 10 and above because the topic is a little harsh for a 9 or below year old, and people who seek the excitement of overcoming racism should watch this movie.",

            "content": "How Stellar!\nMovie Review of Hidden Figures by Ted Melfi\n\nThe movie Hidden Figures represents its name to the fullest, bringing out colors that only select few have. It follows three black women named Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Katherine Goble that are employees of NASA. The story is set during the Space Race - a time where America and Russia battled to become the first on the moon -while women at the time were discriminated against. Despite all odds, Mary Jackson and her cohorts solve NASA's problem, calculating the trajectory of the Apollo 11. The movie has many controversial topics such as discrimination and feminism that are illustrated in much detail, and the theme of willpower is seen everywhere throughout the movie.\nSince Hidden Figures was set during the Space Race, there is still much discrimination against \"colored folk\". At the beginning of the movie, a racist police officer stops Mary, Dorothy, and Katherine and asks for their identification. This is a prime example of what the triplet had to go through, especially Dorothy, over the course of the movie. Also, feminism was still around back then, so when the people at NASA doubt the woman's mathematical ability, it is blatantly obvious that men still feel superior to women in all aspects. The movie reflects both of these points wonderfully, and it creates a situation that makes one sit on the edge of their seat.\nHidden Figures is a movie with tough inner struggle, and the theme of willpower is prominent throughout the film. There were several moments where the women could have given up and sought different paths, but instead, they overcame the hardships set before them. In the end, they accomplished their goals, and are honored because of it. Willpower is a strong force, and the movie proves how powerful it can be.\nThe movie Hidden Figures teaches the audience multiple themes such as discrimination, feminism, and willpower. The story is woven in a way that encompasses all three in a fluent, thrilling cinema. They are brought out the way a river flows; strong yet effortlessly showing the audience the reason behind the movie. This movie should be watched by anyone of any age, for it teaches and educates one with ideas that most do not understand fully.\nRating: 4.9/5.0",

            "content": "The three Women that changed NASA\nThe Movie Review of Hidden Figures by Theodore Melfi \nHidden Figures is a historical fiction movie, based on three young black women. The story takes place in Hampton, Virginia, in the year 1961. In this period America was segregated, and blacks didn't have as many privileges as the whites. This movie is centered around Katherine Coleman; one of the three young black main characters. In the movie, the audience sees Katherine's childhood, and her career in Nasa. In the movie, the director does a fantastic job showing all three of the young ladies triumphs and struggles.  Hidden Figures, although historical fiction, has an inspiring plot, satisfactory actors, and amazing themes.\nThe movie opens up, introducing the main character, Katherine Coleman (Taraji P. Henson) as a child waiting in a hallway naming all the shapes in a stain glass window she is looking at. While Kathrine is doing all this, her parents are talking to an official about moving her to a more advanced school for smart people like her. The official wants to move her to 6th grade even though she is only eight years old. Even though her parents are scared they decide to agree and let her take the classes. The next scene goes 35 years into the future when Katherine is older and stuck on the side of the road. This scene is crucial because it introduces two new characters. This scene introduces Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae). Hidden Figures tells the true story of three young women who were the brains behind one of the biggest operations in all of NASA. The movie then goes on to show the audience the struggles and success of their careers at Nasa as they race against Russia to get the first person to do one orbit around the earth. The actors do a fantastic job showing the characters emotions, and each actor plays the roles very well in each scene. \nWhile the characters in the movie are strong, the actors behind the characters are stronger. Each of the actors was experienced and have been in other major productions. Each of the actors portrayed their roles very well.  All of the actors are well known in today's society and are still very successful in acting. \nAlthough Hidden Figures has many important themes, racism and inequality are the most important themes seen throughout the film. During the movie, Kathrine experiences many racial injustices. For example in the film Kathrine has to run across the NASA campus to use the bathroom, she has to make her own coffee because no one made coffee in the \"black\" coffee machine. She also experiences many inequalities. For example, during this period girls didn't have many  high ranking positions. And because Katherine had such a high rank in this operation for NASA, during the film, the audience sees her going through inequality. Since this movie is based on a true story, not everything that happens in the film is true. For example, all the racial and inequality the character goes through in the movie didn't happen in real life. Maybe the film producer put these inequalities in to show what was going on in the time period of the film. \nThis movie targets everyone in the ages ten and up. This audience is targeted because people have to understand and know the history behind America. People can't watch the movie without knowing the events that happened during the year of this movie. Although not fully accurate the movie did a great job showing how she contributed to NASA and US history.\nHidden Figures is a well-rounded movie overall. With a satisfactory plot, amazing actors, and important themes, this film does an excellent job telling the story of three women that changed history.  This film allows people to see history from a different perspective. The audience also sees NASA at a different perspective. Although targeting anyone above the age of ten and up this book will open many peoples eyes to see history from a different angle.",

            "content": "Figures No Longer Hidden\nA Movie Review of Hidden Figures written by Margot Lee Shetterly\nHidden Figures, a film written by Margot Lee Shetterly and directed by Theodore Melfi, is a detailed representation of the young lives of former NASA workers Katherine Johnson (Taraji Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e). The drama shows the viewers what life was like for the three black women working in a \"man's world\" during racist times. In this film, Katherine Johnson grows up a mathematical genius with a bright mind but a slim chance. Because of racism and sexism, Katherine faces challenges of making a living when she cannot find a job where she can work to her full potential. After her talent is noticed, Johnson and her two friends finally get employed at NASA as a computer. In the beginning, she is discriminated and struggles to prove her skill. The film Hidden Figures thoroughly describes the hardships black women had to go through during the 1930's and how they were recognized as heroes. \n    The film exemplifies all the challenges Jones, Vaughan, and Jackson faced through subtle but significant events. For example, when Katherine needs to use the restroom, the racism is so extreme, she needs to walk across town to use the colored restroom because there were no colored restrooms at NASA. This issue was only brought to attention when Johnson's boss questioned why she was gone for so long every day at work. The women of the film constantly struggled with being underestimated. This is evident when Johnson's co-workers thought she was incapable of understanding most of the calculations in one of the documents used to build the rocket. The person who gave her the document blacked out the majority of the page because it was confidential. Johnson proved herself intelligent enough to comprehend the numbers by looking at the blacked out numbers through the light and correcting them, so that the rocket could be corrected. Because of her actions, she earned herself more respect in the office and deemed herself reliable enough to solve issues. This event is an inspirational lesson on how not to give up when doubted, and to keep working hard through challenges. \nUnfortunately, women were still doubted and underestimated during the 1930's. Because of this, Hidden Figures focused deeply on bringing attention to why these women should not have gone unnoticed. The purpose of the film was to make its audience realize how powerful Johnson and her friends were in ways that their co-workers never imagined. Today, the world still partially struggles with sexism and racism, but this could be changed by bringing other historical female-heroes out of the shadows. The title, Hidden Figures, is a clever way to express what the topic of the film was. Figures, as in geometry, apply to this movie because to make the rocket successful, Johnson needed to find out what went wrong in the calculations. Figures, as in important people, pertained to this film because the three heroic women were under the shadows of people who thought they were better than the rest. Therefore, this film brought out figures that were hidden in two significant ways. Hidden Figures efficiently brought attention to three important women of U.S. history. \nThis movie exceptionally shows true heroes through a sweet and detailed story. The way humor and romance were incorporated only made it more interesting. Hidden Figures might be enjoyable to those seeking an inspirational story of the underdogs of the world. This movie can make the audience smile with its witty humor and sentimental storyline. Someone who desires an action-filled film might not want to watch  Hidden Figures.  This movie receives 4/5 stars.",

            "content": "Strengths: It's called Oscar bait for a reason. The performances from the three leads are what drives the movie. Taraji P. Henson (Katherine Goble Johnson) is the strongest of the three and mostly feels like the protagonist. Octavia Spencer (Dorothy Vaughn) is strong and Janelle Monae (Mary Jackson) is the surprise standout. The supporting cast is mostly very good, with Kevin Costner (Al Harrison) the best among them. The script allows for several powerful scenes and monologues that really showcase what these women went through and how strong they were. It's uplifting, empowering, and hits all the beats it needs to so we get the desired feeling when it ends. \n\nWeaknesses: I understand how smart these women were, but I think the film goes a bit far in making the men in the movie seem dumb. Jim Parsons' (Paul Stafford) character is a head engineer, but is made to look like a total idiot. The same goes for the IBM guys. There were ways to ensure that the main women looked smart without having everyone else seem incompetent. Several beats were overused. The moments where the women experience racism are crucial, but it gets done so much that it feels redundant. I also felt that Mahershala Ali (Jim Johnson) was underutilized, while Kirsten Dunst (Vivian Mitchell) wasn't very good.\n\nOverall: There's a lot to like about this emotional journey. It just could've been handled much better to make for a better film experience.",

            "content": "these are big shoes to be filled..\n\nHidden Figures\n\nMelfi's adaptation of Shetterly's book fails to grasp the stakes and magnitude of the content that the entire feature orbits around. And it can easily be filtered out from all the running sequences it executes since it could have been a bit more intense than it actually pretends to be. The narration is not only adaptive and gripping but contains layered dialogues that strikes well on your mind that highlights the entire sequence through it. If Henson; the protagonist, fails to live up to the potential of the role offered to her and mind that these are big shoes to be filled, she is blessed with an incredible supporting cast that helps elevate the momentum in each frame. \n\nNo matter how stereotypical Costner's character gets, he still delivers thoroughly and on the other hand Spencer too leaves a long lasting impression through her performance. Although, Monae, Dunst and Parsons are surprisingly not convincing enough to blend in aptly into these numbers along with a bit amateur editing and lazy background score. The theme of the tale is genuinely fascinating as the three lead characters resonates their persona with such impactful notions in the storytelling that you cannot not be moved by it. \n\nThey swoop in as their savior with such subtilty that you are practically wolfish rooting for more and more. And with the conflicts like such and the rivalries that anchors and holds them down, these moments glorify them itself. Melfi is undoubtedly a better writer than the director, his nature to weave out a gripping structure is much more powerful than convincingly projecting one. A tale fragile and powerful as Hidden Figures probably required better methodology and treatment in order to draw out more than a nod from the viewers, but the work that went in here is still plausible enough to explore these figures.",

            "content": "Virginia 1961. The United States and USSR are heavily in the Cold War. Internally, there is still many problems between the 2 main races, white and black, that have left major divisions within the country as not all states have embraced the federal government's treaty to end segregation and persecution. One of these states is the home base of NASA. Segregation is abound and white people seem to be very OK with this, despite it making them look like creepy villains whenever they feel the need to take charge of a situation. The movie follows 3 black women, each as brilliant as the other in different ways. A mathematician, an engineer and a self taught computer wizard, these women are employed by NASA in there computing division. They seem to be treated more as a token division then a hard working, noteworthy division filled with intelligent, talented women that can take NASA to that next level. Once Sputnik is launched into space by the Russians and then they send a man into space for a few orbits, the Americans are basically forced to rush into the space wars or else get left behind. Having exhausted themselves, NASA brings in Katherine Johnson to help troubleshoot the math that the white men she worked under had put together. We watch her slowly earn their respect by running circles around them with her brains both in her equations and problem solving abilities but also in how she is able to manipulate office politics to further her pursuit of being taken more seriously. We also watch the other two women take matters into their own hands as they are constantly berated and belittled by white people seemingly just for fun. Watching Mary Jackson manipulate a judge in order to gain admittance to an all white school so she can obtain an engineering degree that would aide in her quest to be deemed an equal amongst her peers and to be able to help build and design future NASA tech. However, in my opinion, the star of the movie is Octavia Spencer playing Dorothy Vaughan. Seeing this oppressed woman fight back by simply taking initiative is heartwarming and also inspiring. Teaching herself how to use the brand new, state of the art IBM calculating machines, she becomes a necessary asset within the NASA ranks despite never being asked to nor being encouraged to do more then she already was with her duties. We watch her simply do what she wants, with the caveat that she is not being selfish but instead working to better NASA as a whole. Her journey is long and arduous but has a very satisfying conclusion. Based on real events, this movie is amazing and a must see for anyone looking to learn more about events that helped shaped our world.",

            "content": "After watching the diversity film Hidden Figures, I felt that the movie could have been so much more.  Sadly the movie continually bashes white males, making them look slow and stupid, while showing the trio of Hidden Figures as genius unrivaled.  Especially disappointing is the demeaning manner in which IBM computer scientists are treated. Too stupid to even find the right-sized room, set up a mainframe, or program it, in one scene, as the IBM males clumsily stammer about, Dorothy Vaughn walks in and at a glance, finds the problem, a loose wire, which she magically plugs in and solves everything!  Vaughn  is also cast as a genius FORTRAN expert who must do her work after hours because the white male neanderthals won't let her work normal hours.  My white male cousin went to MIT and became an IBM computer research scientist, so I take the portrayal of IBM scientists as defamation of character.  Moreover, it was an IBM research team that developed the FORTRAN language.  Who deserves a Congressional Medal - the team that developed FORTRAN or the Hidden Figure who learned how to use it, like millions of others?\n    In its hate fest against white males, the movie portrays NASA engineers as racists who are all much dumber than the Hidden Figures. In reality, however, Mary Jackson was mentored by a brilliant NASA engineer by the name of Czarnecki who published over 300 scientific papers, to about 26 for Jackson; and many of Jackson's papers were written with Czarnecki.  But the movie ignores the fact that Jackson was helped because it's goal was to demean Czarneki and other white males as essentially Nazis.\n   Speaking of Nazis, the movie also overlooks the fact that a real Nazi, Von Braun, was responsible for getting the U.S. to the moon,  This is an important historical fact for our young people to know, but in the world of diversity, who cares about real history?\n    In the movie Katherine Johnson is cast as a mathematical prodigy who, though more brilliant than her male counterparts, is treated like dirt.  Johnson is from a small town in West Virginia, not far from Bluefield where John Forbes Nash was born in the same time period .  Lets's compare these two mathematical geniuses.  Nash, portrayed by Russel Crowe in \"A Beautiful Mind,\" won the Fields Medal in Mathematics, and  many other prestigious awards for his groundbreaking  work.  However, I haven't found anything comparable for Johnson that thousands of mathematicians haven't accomplished.\n    Oddly enough, Dorothy Vaughn went to school less than 100 miles from John Glenn in Ohio.  Glenn's character shows that Ohioans had a totally different view of Blacks than did Virginians in that time period. Glenn would have been horrified to see that in Virginia, that \"five and dime\" stores had drinking fountains labelled \"Colored People.\"  Yes, the south was a different world than the land of Grant and Sherman.\n    It is so sad that a movie like this would have such a small-minded and hateful outlook (so many outright untruths) against white males, rather than celebrating that opportunities and mentoring  offered to African Americans during the early period of the space race.",

            "content": "- The heartfelt genius of Hidden Figures -\n\nJust go and see Hidden Figures right now.  Honestly, stop what you are doing and go.  There couldn't be a better time for the U.S. and the world to receive this gift of perseverance and unity in an era of apathy and individualism.  \n\nAnd to top it off, Hidden Figures is just so much fun!  \n\nThis incredible true story follows three African American women mathematicians working for NASA during the space race.  The film is based on Margot Lee Shetterly's nonfiction book of the same title.  Our three heroes played by Taraji P. Henson (Empire), Octavia Spencer (Fruitvale Station) and Janelle Mon\u00e1e (Moonlight) support John Glenn in his historic three-time orbit around the earth by calculating his flight path.  They've been hired as \"human computers\" by Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia in an era long before the use of electronic computers.   \n\nIt's 1961 and computing the calculations for NASA's projects is done by hand and is considered secretarial. Secretarial means that this is a job relegated to women.  Despite their bright minds, our African American heroes are segregated from their counterparts due to Jim Crow laws.  These women were first classified by their gender and then segregated by their race.           \n\nI have a complicated relationship with the issues of racial and gender inequality explored in Hidden Figures.  I am mixed.  I'm so mixed I'm multi-racial.  My dad is black and Puerto Rican.  My mom is white.  This makes me what I call a white-passing WOC - woman of color.  I say white-passing because despite my mixed lineage, the world views and treats me as white because of the light color of my skin.  \n\nI don't have to face the daily hurdles that someone with a dark complexion does.  Were I smart enough to work at NASA and it was currently the 1960s, I may have worked with the \"computers\" rather than the \"colored computers\".  Hidden Figures, although set in another era, reflects the contemporary debates surrounding gender and race.  I wonder, how much has changed?  How do I fit into this current social, cultural dynamic?  \n\nKatherine G. Johnson, played by Taraji P. Henson, graduated high school at 14 and college at 18 summa cum laude.  If you are not already dizzy in love with Taraji P. Henson who plays Cookie in Empire, this is your gateway drug. Her performance perfectly captures the mind boggling smarts and determination of real-life Katherine and hit me right in the heart.  \n\nAs the only computer with a deep knowledge of analytical geometry, Katherine receives an assignment to calculate flight trajectories for upcoming missions.  This new project suddenly makes her the only African American woman on the team.\n\nDue to her new and unusual placement, she's now forced to run half a mile to use the \"colored ladies\" room and is given a small designated coffee pot that no one else will touch.  For me, this was rage-inducing.  Combating that negativity, we are invited to whole-heartedly root and cheer for every late night number crunching session and every mathematical triumph, all underscored by Pharrell Williams' nostalgic and superb soundtrack.  The song \"Runnin\" perfectly punctuated Katherine's high heeled shuffling trips to the bathroom.  \n\nThe Hidden Figures soundtrack which also includes Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Alicia Keys and Mary J. Blige is now my household listening requirement by the way.    \n\nKatherine's two best friends Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) have worship-worthy stories of their own.  Dorothy is lobbying for a title and pay that match the high level of work she is doing while she studies electronic computer programming on the side.  Mary progresses her own journey for advancement via the white-only school system in an attempt to become NASA's first black female engineer.  Hell yes.\n\nThe movie's highlights of strength in the face of adversity were as satisfying and entertaining as the soundtrack.  One particular moment stands out.  Katherine's boss, played by Kevin Costner (Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, The Company Men), clearly doubts her mathematical prowess and begins to ask her to use a certain calculation technique.  She interrupts him with more knowledge than he seems to have expected. \"Orthonormalization algorithm? Yes, sir. I prefer it over Euclidean Coordinates.\"  \n\nDespite having no idea what any of that means, it was so fun to laugh while clapping at Katherine's show of knowledge.  The whole theater erupted.  It was an amazing feeling of common unity and celebration.  A feeling that lasted throughout the entire movie.  \n\nVivian Mitchell, played by Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette), works as a supervisor in the white segment of the computers.  While Dorothy does the equivalent job of the black workers, she is given a higher status and paid more.  The tension between Vivian and Katherine highlights the divisive subject of women undermining other women in order to succeed.  The breakdown of oppressed groups that can't, won't or haven't united for equality could fill many libraries.  \n\nBut Hidden Figures is as much about unity as it is about racial and gender divide.  The characters who join together and do not leave others behind were the most successful in this story.  It's a beautiful picture of what we can achieve as people if we look out for more than ourselves.  This is best exemplified in the pivotal moment when Dorothy is finally offered a promotion. She will only accept it if all of her co-workers are able to advance with her.  \n\nDorothy could easily have taken her prize and left all of the others to their own devices but the movie rejects that kind of individualism.  In keeping with the movie's message of strength in community, she has already trained her co-workers in her newly learned computational skills and prepared them for advancement.\n\nHidden Figures' heartfelt message sliced through the complications of inequity and offered a story of empathy and unity. Its bold message declares that working together and caring for others is the only way to glory and success.  This message is heartening to me.  And it's important - now more than ever.  It's important to share ideas of community and compassion through mass mediums like film and Hidden Figures delivers this in delightful spades.  And not only that, it makes math and intellectual pursuit seem like a blast!\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://narrativemuse.co/movies/hidden-figures, and was written by Melissa Balint.

This is not to say that such storytelling is easy work, however. For a teaching moment to be this heartwarming, entertaining, and rousing, it takes a very intelligent design and the true beauty of the film comes down to how the whole production explains a complex problem involving segregation and empowerment with such a single, satisfying solution. This PG-rated drama presents the story of a team of female African-American mathematicians (Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae) who served a vital role in NASA during the early years of the U.S. space program.  \n\nCertainly, the true events on which Hidden Figures is based didn't unfold so breezily in real life and the actual hidden figures themselves didn't enjoy such a breezy journey. This is a film meant to fuel the soul of all filmgoers, however, especially women and people of color. Its intent is to raise the spirits--not look back in abject anger. This is why their story has been re-purposed as a crowd-pleaser. With a PG rating, it is meant to be accessible. If it encourages action as well, this is only a good thing. But Hidden Figures's main purpose is to inform, honor, and celebrate, which the film does with great dignity and grace. \n\nAdapted from the book by Margot Lee Shetterly, Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi's screenplay provides the perfect template for this successful rendering. The casting only sweetens the pot. Spectacular turns by veterans Henson and Spencer as well as relative newcomer Monae (a breakout role, to be sure) drive the strong narrative. The great supporting performances of Kevin Costner, Jim Parson, and Mahershala Ali likewise deserve mention but this is definitely the ladies' show. As director, Melfi has pulled off a ridiculously impressive feat. Not only does Joan Q. Filmgoer learn about some criminally overlooked figures from American history, but she feels pretty damn good about doing so.\n\nTo Sum It Up: All Plusses, No Minuses",

And boy, that is true for movies too!\nHIDDEN FIGURES\nIn the light of the recent Oscar nominations I've started my yearly goal of watching every single full-feature film fiction before the ceremony. The last two years I've been successful at this task and I figure this time it will be no different. To keep you updated in my task, I'll post reviews in almost every film nominated this year, including films I've seen quite a while ago and that I didn't have time to write a review about. Shifting now my attention to the movie in cause, I have to say that, from the movies nominated, this seems like one of the weaker offers. Despite rating Deadpool just a little higher, I'd be quicker to nominate it for Best Picture first (same with Civil War, Silence, Zootopia, etc.). Despite this, I get why this was nominated as it's almost an obligation to the Academy to nominate films that perpetuate anti-racist messages, especially under the new president. You have to understand that a film's right to be nominated for best picture isn't based solely on the quality of it. With a Best Picture nom often comes a lot of visibility to the film and, consequently, to the matter in question. That's why many studios spend some under the table money to get their features nominated, as they know they'll make back that amount and way more. So, there's a social conscience rescuing this movie from falling flat and from being goldless. In fact, this movie's success pivots around the plot and makes me think why haven't I heard this story sooner. It's an excellent story revolving around a smart script that matches it. The performances are all solid but I was expecting them to be better. Octavia Spencer gives one good performance but a quite manageable too, judging from most of her filmography. I find that she didn't quite deserve her nomination and many performers could have had her spot, though it's amusing to see Viola and Spencer nominated again, the former winning this time around. It also has a strong supporting cast, with Jim Parsons, Kevin Kostner and, especially, Kristen Dunst. However, there's something too neat about the film's directing, editing and cinematography. The director doesn't take many chances, he shoots a scene like any other person would and in this case I don't mind it so much, but it leaves edginess to be desired, that extra excitement that should come from watching a movie for the first time. Ultimately, it's a very good movie that would have been better if it hadn't relied so much on its release date and important plot. It's one of those movies that you should see as a citizen of the world, not much as a cinephile.. .",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is the true story of the women behind the space program in 1961. The three women face issues besides the math behind the launch, they face segregation and sexism. This movie was a successful attempt to inspire women and those of color. Trying to encourage them to break through stereotypes and do what you must even if it is difficult. Besides inspiring, this movie wanted to bring the stories of the quiet heroes to light. The director and writers did just that. They showed the struggles these women faced for their country.\nOne way that \"Hidden Figures\" tried to inspire was by inspiring women and young girls to go for a career in math and science. In the movie not only did the three main women have to face and get through the racism that was still present but they had to face sexism that was still just as much of an issue. It was believed that women aren't as smart as men and that they were meant to just raise a family, clean, and cook. Hidden Figures shows girls that a career in such field as math or science is possible and that they can make a difference. Actor Aldis Hodge said \"I love the fact that a lot of these girls are now getting support for their interest.\", though his role in the movie that quite small he still gets to witness the difference this film is making. The screenwriters even snuck a little hint towards inspiring women in these careers into the dialogue. The character Karl Zielinski says \"a person with an engineer's mind should be an engineer.\" this was towards a black female character, Mary Jackson, who was struggling following her dreams.\nIf it wasn't for this movie then the stories of these women probably would be unknown to all. If some people did know of them before the movie that's amazing but it just isn't enough. These women did extraordinary work and made huge breakthroughs in history. Honestly if it wasn't for their hard work and calculations the space launch could have failed or even been delayed. The directors found it important to show what they did to the world using the big screen and by adding slight humor to it. Obviously the movie isn't exactly accurate but it still accomplishing showing the work of these women. Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Dorothy Vaughan are all now recognizable names.\nAlthough this movie added humor and made it a nice family film, the subtle racism and sexism behind are made apparent to adults or older people. When irritated the character Mary Jackson says \"Every time we get a chance to get ahead they move the finish line.\" this really shows how much harder they had to work just to do what a white man could have done in half the time it takes the black women. It shows just how strong and brave they are because they still tried and never let anybody stop them. Knowing the struggles they had to go through while just doing their job and trying to help their country makes it even more amazing.\n    This movie is just as important as it is entertaining. The writers accomplished a lot by making it funny and cute while still addressing the problems they faced. Everybody who worked on this movie hopes that it will, inspire, bring the hidden stories to light, and show the struggles these girls had to face. It's important to know these things so we can have an appreciation for the hidden heroes. Which sometimes are the most important ones. Some would say it's the perfect movie, entertaining for all ages, has an important message, and funny.",

You could say it is about the struggle African-Amercians had to get recognized in the '60s. Perhaps it is about NASA trying desperately to catch up the the Soviet space program. Or maybe it's about the under-representation of women in fields such as science and engineering (hang on, isn't that still the case?) The truth is, the film juggles a lot of issues deftly, without sacrificing the impact of any single point.\n\nThis film boasts an excellent cast, championed by Taraji P. Henson. She shows so many aspects of Katherine Johnson, and elevates everyone she is in a scene with. Octavia Spencer is always fun to watch, and she brings he A-game here. Janelle Monae rounds out our three leads, and provides a great foil for them. Other standout performances include Kevin Costner and Jim Parsons.\n\nSome of the directing choices were not my thing (the use of historical footage was a bit to intercut), and there were aspects that I wasn't as into as the math, computing, and literal rocket science parts of the movie, but I cannot deny how well-put-together this package is.",

And do some research to check some details - love the Internet.\n\nYes, I know the film is not a documentary, I know that there is such a thing as dramatic licence and artistic licence and so forth, but - Holy Fuck - this was not, as advertised, a \"dramatic biopic\"; it was fairytale. The impact was doubled by the hideous dumbing-down of everything. Everything was a caricature. There are no real, 3-D people in this film. There are only goodies and baddies. The goodies are always right, and the baddies are always wrong. In fact, some of the goodies have magical powers and do things that are ridiculous and impossible - sort of the cerebral equivalent of action heroes in a Chuck Norris film, I suppose. There are 2 speaking part baddies who get redemption at the end of the film by seeing the error of their ways and finally behaving nicely. Ta-dah! Redemption level achieved. Lesson learned. Example set. Didn't see that coming, did you?\n\nThe central theme is that both black people (\"coloreds\") and women were treated unequally at the time in the US, and the film lays this on with a trowel. And then a shovel. And then a series of dump trucks. OK, the film-maker is entitled to emphasis his point, and these things were true in many aspects of everyday life, and this would be a fair enough take, except for one important thing. The average viewer would come away thinking that racial segregation was endemic at NASA, which is actually the opposite of the truth. NASA was a federally-mandated equal opportunity employer (one of the first), and in fact, set up by Johnson that way to provide opportunities for education, employment and advancement for blacks. Yes, there was one \"Colored Women's Bathroom\" (left over from the old NACA days), but it wasn't 1/2 a mile away, and the sign wasn't dramatically knocked down with a tyre iron in front of a breathless audience by the head of NASA (or Kevin Costner). As usual, the truth was more prosaic. Its existence was mostly ignored, and the sign was eventually removed with a memo. Apparently this tyre iron scene in the film had US audiences cheering. Cheering. Did they think it was real? Or even remotely likely? \n The logic wouldn't fool a 12 year old.\n\nWhile this film provides, apparently, many uplifting moments, I found it so contrived and false and wrong (unintentionally in many places) that I was alternating between outraged gasps and laughing out loud. I know that this is a common experience for those of us with an interest in history, but there is one difference here: many of the the people who worked there at the time are still around, and they must love that they're all being painted as misogynistic racists.\nMost people don't read books or even articles. The film is what they will think was the truth. That's sad.\nI could list all the distortions, exaggerations, and stupid scientific/factual errors in this film, but that will have to wait until I have a few hours spare.",

            "content": "A feel-good movie about mathematics, the space race, and the civil rights struggle for African-American women - based on a true story.  Prior to the installation of their first IBM mainframe (depicted in the film), NASA used human \"computers\" to check and double-check calculations; the film follows a group of three of these African American women from the \"coloured computer\" group.  Taraji P. Henson plays Katherine G. Johnson who assisted with advanced calculations for John Glenn's first orbit around the Earth (and subsequently the Apollo 11 mission and flights in the space shuttle era).  Henson's experiences in the all-white NASA offices and engineering labs shown here are, as expected, sometime unpleasant (as when she is snubbed by white colleagues) but sometimes positive (as when she is supported by white colleagues, such as boss Al Harrison, played by Kevin Costner).  Janelle Mon\u00e1e plays Mary Jackson who successfully became NASA's first African American female engineer (after challenging Virginia's segregated school's policy).  Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughan who became NASA's first African American female supervisor, running the IBM computer lab.  Although their stories are true, they remained largely unheralded until this film (which Johnson was alive to see at age 98) - so it is worth trumpeting their stereotype-breaking successes.  The movie itself sticks to the feel-good playbook, providing a bit of backstory to each of the characters, a little romance for Johnson, showing their lives outside of work, a few ugly incidents (racism), and, of course, some tension before everything falls into place as a result of the hard work of these women. And it's all set to some rousing music (coordinated by Pharrell Williams).  In the end, NASA benefits, the US moves ahead of the Soviets in the space race, and best of all, these women also experience gratifying personal success.  However, this is the Hollywood version of their story, so don't expect anything edgy or challenging.",

Each of their characters were deep enough, all three of them could've each had their own movie, but I really enjoyed the way they linked all three of these stories together. The movie deals a lot with the U.S Space Program in the 60's and the \"Space Race\" with the Russians, and the tension within NASA during that time is definitely well translated into this movie, from the clothing, to the scenery, even down to the accents, it was all perfect. There were some times in this movie where they tried to introduce some side stories into the main plot, which didn't really contribute much to the big picture of the movie, so I feel as though some of those parts could've either gotten more time, or just been scrapped completely in order to make the important parts even better. All in all though, \"Hidden Figures\" is a great movie about empowerment in the 60's, and is definitely worth watching.",

Today we talk about discrimination against women, though this film is an example that it all had started way long ago, yet the struggle has not ended. Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA.\n\nThe film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed.\n\nThe others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon.

The story of three African-American women who are mathematicians at NASA in the early 1960s is an important one to tell. It is a bit surprising that this had not been told prior to this film and the book it is based upon. Given the current tensions we are living through, Hidden Figures is an important film to watch.",

It's shot in a bright, cheery style, even though it deals with some heavy handed issues of race and sexism, I also enjoyed the music a lot, which is courtesy of Hans Zimmer and Pharrell Williams amongst other. The only thing I didn't like, and which has nothing to do with the film making persei, is that, even after all these years, the social stigma around sex and race still exists, especially in the current sociopolitical climate of the United States of Amerca",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) We re introduced to three African American women stranded on the road in 1960 s Virginia. They are  computers  - women who perform computations for NASA s space program. Katherine Goble (Taraji P. Henson) performs computations for the Mercury program. Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon e) works as an engineer in the wind tunnels for the Mercury. And Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) acts as a supervisor for the other computing women, all of whom are Black. Goble has been reassigned to work on the trajectories for the upcoming manned-flights of the Mercury program. She is dismissed by the other mathematicians because she is a woman, and a Black woman at that. Among her many challenges is the fact that the restrooms in the facility are segregated. And the only  colored  rest room for women is across the campus. She frequently has to run a half mile to use the ladies  room - taking her work with her.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Meanwhile, Mary diagnoses a problem in the experimental space capsules heat shields, inspiring her to pursue an engineering degree. She convinces a judge to grant her permission to attend night classes at an all-white school. Dorothy learns that a huge new IBM computer will replace her co-workers. She sneaks into the computer room and successfully operates the machine. At the library she is scolded for visiting the whites-only section on computer programming. She teaches herself Fortran and is promoted to supervise the programming department, arranging for her women co-workers to be transferred there.\n\nGREG: There aren t many movies featuring women in technology, let alone women of color. Most of our images of engineers and scientists are of young men (see The Social Network). What is marvelous about this film is that it features three such women. They not only have to face gender stereotypes, but also battle racial divides. The common trope in films dealing with race is that there is a white benefactor who lifts the African American up to where they belong. We see this in such films as The Blind Side, 42, and Race. But in Hidden Figures we re witness to women who deal with their stereotyped roles head on and fend for themselves. It s a refreshing change. I was moved to tears watching Mary stand before a judge and plead her case to be allowed into an all-white community college. I know people who have had to fight for what they have earned. But they deal with a level playing field. Mary has the deck stacked against her. She not only has to change the mind of the white judge who blocks her way into school, but that of her militant husband who believes that violence is the only answer. Hidden Figures delivers three powerful examples of women overcoming prejudice on their own terms.\n\nSCOTT: You re absolutely right, Greg. Hidden Figures shows the shattering of two barriers, gender and race, in the early 1960s. I had never heard this true story of these three remarkable women, and I m ashamed of either myself, or the system in which I was raised that suppressed this story, or both. These three heroes won my heart and earned my deepest respect. Like Jackie Robinson in 42, they knew that breaking barriers required them to take the high road when encountering inevitable prejudice and pushback. Their lives and careers were complex, difficult, way-paving and inspiring to say the least. There may not have been any overt White helpers per se, but one cannot overlook the open-mindedness of people who assisted or supported these women s efforts. Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) deserves kudos in his supervisory role, helping Katherine Goble adjust to her new position and even taking a sledgehammer to the  whites only  restroom sign. The judge who bends an existing exclusionary rule also helps Mary get the education she seeks. There almost have to be people in the majority race who step up to do the right thing in the service of our heroes. Having said that, I agree that this film more than most others we ve seen emphasizes the independent nature of our heroes  quest to break their barriers.\n\nGREG: We see some good mentoring and leadership in Dorothy s character. She recognizes that the world is changing and that computing machines are the next big thing. So she learns the FORTRAN computing language and teaches it to her staff. So, when the machine finally work, and the management is looking for programmers, Dorothy is ready with 30 women trained to go. I liked Hidden Figures very much. I often look for the  seams  in a movie where the structure shows through. But I was so engrossed in the story that the seams fell away. We have three different and connected hero s journeys - and each got ample screen time. The movie is inspirational to women and people of color, but it also shines a bright light on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Women and minorities are often left behind in the STEM world, and I think Hidden Figures will inspire a new generation of engineers. I give Hidden Figures 5 out of 5 Reels. Scott, we often look for transformation in our heroes, but sometimes the heroes transform others instead. Katherine showed that she could do a job as well as any white man. In so doing she changed the culture of NASA to be more inclusive. Dorothy broke barriers by becoming the first black woman to be a supervisor at NASA. And Mary changed the educational system to allow blacks into their community college. In each case the transformation was on society as a whole, rather than in the heroes. I give these three women 5 out of 5 Heroes. It s hard to find good mentors, and Hidden FIgures is no different. Each of these women had to forge onward using their own skills and intelligence. But they did it essentially alone. When you re the first to arrive in the  special world  there often isn t someone there to act as a mentor. We did witness some good mentoring in Dorothy and her team of  computers.  So I can only muster 2 Mentor points. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: All your praise directed at Hidden Figures is right on the mark, Greg. These brave, remarkable women did what society s best heroes do, namely, set out on a journey that will bring them pain and resistance from others, defying social conventions that need defying. This movie deserves strong consideration for Best Picture in 2016. I also give it 5 Reels out of 5. As with other way-pavers and barrier-breakers, these Hidden Figures are both transformed and transforming. We talk about heroes being both the source and the target of transformation in our latest book, Reel Heroes & Villains. These women grow in their courage and resilience, and they have no doubt (and will no doubt) inspire generations of historically oppressed individuals to reach for the stars, both literally and figuratively. I give our heroes 5 Hero points out of 5. There is mentoring going on in this movie but as we ve pointed out, this film emphasizes the fierce independence of these women. Yes, they got help of course, but their success derived mostly from their own innate talent and indomitable spirit. I ll award 3 mentor points out of 5 for the subtle ways that our Hidden Figures received little nudges of help behind the scenes. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:",

Unbeknown to them, the expertise they require is working locked in a basement of Nasa specifically sealed off from the rest of the staff due to their race.  Once recognised these women still struggle to do their jobs efficiently due to the barriers they face which again are only there because of their race.  Despite this they continue to fight to do their jobs because there are higher things at stake than their own happiness.

It's a nice story and a strong moral, if a bit on the safe side. Nothing seems terribly difficult for these women, whether it's theoretical physics or racial equality, which reduces the power of their eventual success. One early scene epitomizes this attitude: broken down on the side of the road, they're approached by a stereotypical southern white policeman. Though internally panicked, they proudly stand their ground and deflect his barbs, and moments later he's giving them a friendly escort to the workplace. Faced with any degree of adversity, they merely hunker down, redouble their efforts and glide to victory. Which is admirable, and possibly truthful, if not especially gripping. The acting is good - Taraji P. Henson is most memorable as a mousey mother of three whose sole public outburst provides the film's only major dash of flavor - but the plot is too interested in lobbing softballs when it could've been pitching something with teeth. A warm, simple tale, appropriate viewing for a Sunday night with the family if not for challenging conventions.",

Never have I enjoyed watching a biographical drama as much as I did watching Hidden Figures and the reason for that is the lively, funny, and empowering qualities that aren't meant to bait Academy Award nominations, but to actually be experienced and loved. A day may come when the Academy will grant blockbuster films a chance at winning awards and this film is definitely a great start.",

This film shines a light on the inherent inequality of \"separate but equal\".   It focuses on the small things, the day-today logistics of trying to live equally in an unequal world, and is all the more powerful for it.  The characters are fighting systemic racism rather than overt racism, and that battle is even more daunting a fight.  It'll piss you off, for sure.  The acting is outstanding across the board, the story is very well-written, but the directing for me was just ho-hum.  Yeah, it's an amazing story, and one that it is high time was told, but it could have been told with more pizzazz and originality.  If it weren't for its incredible subject, the film itself is pretty standard movie fare.  The writing is the best thing about it - it's well paced and includes a good deal of humor, which is always welcome with such serious subject matter.  Best of all, it is not emotionally manipulative like I expected it to be.  However, even though there is no mustache-twirling evil racist villain, it does fall back on the \"good white people\" and \"bad white people\" characterizations, and even the \"good\" white people are totally-self serving.  I'm sure not everybody in the 60s fell so neatly into one of those two categories.  Regardless, it's shocking to realize that this stuff happened only 50-off years ago.  That's not very long, and we still have a long way to go.",

And speak it does. \n\nWith strong performances across the board, HIdden Figures helps shed some light on a little known story of the Jim Crow era that helped not only to progress the rights of African American women, but changed the world in a big way at a time when the race to space dominated culture and politics. If I am honest, I feel ashamed to say I was not aware of the four women at the heart this film, which I suppose reflects the sentiment of the film's title. But this is why Hidden Figures was so successful with both audiences and critics. It opened my eyes and entertained me while doing it. \n\nWhile all of the performances stand out in their own right, Taraji P. Henson was especially notable. The way she embodies a set of mannerisms foreign to her natural tendencies is a testament to the way she throws herself into her character. It is almost understated but incredibly effectual. She helps ground the scope of the story, which could have gotten lost in the grand picture of space and the promise of the new frontier, in the human element, which in actuality is where the most compelling parts of the story flow out of. As impressive as it is to consider the groundbreaking efforts that led to the first orbits of the earth (and these moments are intense), it is the subtlety of scenes such as having to run across Nasa headquarters just to use a \"colours only\" bathroom sign, or the intimate family portraits that show a husband and wife, children and parents trying to find their way in a segregated landscape that sticks with me in the end.",

Also, it almost feels like the screenwriters might have taken some creative license here. What are the odds that three best friends who carpool together to work all become ground-breaking figures in their respective disciplines? It's like figuring the odds that three children growing up on the same block all grow up to be senators. It's highly unlikely. Two of the women get their big breaks on the same morning. I wanted the writers to put more realism into the script. I am sure they were all great at their jobs, but I felt like I was missing information about the connection between the three women. Precisely how much intersection was there truly between their lives? When did they meet each other? Were they all innately ambitious, or did they influence each other to become ambitious? Or did they simply work in the same location without necessarily being that close? Did they get hired around the same time? I remember some voiceover description about the beginning of their careers, but it wasn't enough to stick with me. How did the carpooling arrangement start? I needed something extra there that was just missing from the story. I feel like, if one of them were to write a memoir, the true story wouldn't be quite as coincidental.",

When the movie ended I said two things, which got a laugh.  \n\n\"HE made HER a cup of coffee, like a little bitch\"\n\nand\n\n\"So it was mainly white men who got a man into space.\"  Obviously not the main theme of the movie (but it was there, so a little shout out to the people the movie wasn't aimed at).\n\nHumour, people.  Humour.  That's what's going to solve this whole thing.  This movie had humour, warmth, and it wasn't blamey.",

Sure, it's about civil rights, and it has good strong moral things to say: but here's a film that knows you get farther by enchanting people than lecturing them.  While all of the lead characters participate a little bit in the Strong Black Woman archetype (because the characters ARE strong black women), they're also rich with individuality and human interest.  Caricatures of white prejudice drift through, but truthfully: most of the whites are not \"hateful,\" they're more neglectful.  They don't think about blacks.... until talent, persistence, class, and charm force them to rely on the main characters.  \n\nLoss of a half-star because the math-scenes and inevitable she-discovered-the-formula scenes are lazy and by-rote, but it's forgivable in a film this good.   Should be watched by every American to remind us of why we need each other so very badly, now more than ever before in my lifetime.",

There was a scene where the lead actress (Taraji P. Henson) literally runs in the rain wearing a skirt and heels & carrying some folders of documents and a white man comes across her with an umbrella and he just moves away (showing a hatred to even help). Gut wrenching to imagine how people lived those days in extreme discrimination.\nAwesome performance by Octavia Spencer as well - carries her head throughout the movie. The lead actresses gracefully move throughout the movie with bold & amazing performances.\nThe movie shows the struggles of these women just to even retain their respective jobs and excel at it compared to their white peers (despite having very salaries compared to their white peers).

It is one of those rare films that teaches us to be open-minded and accepting of each other, regardless of color or race.",

Having looked up details of the original story, I can't help but find the true story more inspiring than some elements of the feelgood Hollywood movie. For instance while the running to a \"Colored\" bathroom in another building happened, it happened to one of the other three women, and not Johnson...whereas Johnson apparently just used the white restroom for years, when it was eventually questioned, she said deal with it, and it was dropped.  I like the real story so much better than the boss with a heart of gold who changes the rules for her.  She made the change because she didn't take crap. That's better!  But really, the movie brings their story to light, even if years and details are all wrong (as biopics tend to do), as a movie, it is a bit too Hollywood but it is solid...and how often does a major release like this feature three black female leads?  Pretty much never.  Movie is feelgood entertainment, and it praises hard work, science, intelligence, and working towards your goals no matter the obstacles (whether they be getting a man into space, or just advancing your career while not looking like everyone else)...good message, mostly well told, and a solid picture.",

From battling many wrong perceptions, all simply based on the fact that \"it's never been done before\", to realizing that if you want to make something happen you have to work for it.

People do change, but sometimes you have to show them the way - even if they don't ask you to. The only shame is that these hidden figures were hidden for so long. I'm sure we all never realized the monumental impact of diversity, and that being smart has nothing to do with your skin color or sex.

What he is unaware of is that she was having to run a half an hour to the colored bathroom because there wasn't a bathroom \"for her\" in this building. After realizing how outrageous this was, Al Harrison is seen taking a baseball bat to the colored bathroom sign and exclaims \"Here at NASA, we all pee the same color!\" Katherine's drive and remarkable intelligence made her stand out which in turn showed how ridiculous she was being treated on a daily basis. Al Harrison as a person in power was changed because of how valuable Katherine was. This particular scene was iconic and a turning point in the film. Katherine went from being a \"computer\" to someone who was leading the way for the rest of the program. Despite many failed attempts, the women overcome their struggles and celebrate in succeeding their goal. Hidden Figures uses simple charm and a great story to be a crowd-pleaser for all.\u00a0 \n\nUnlike many Hollywood movies, Hidden Figures did not need expensive sets or special-effects, as the story is enough to capture the audience's attention for two hours all on its own.\u00a0 The story lacks originality, using the same underdog rising to triumph story of many films, but the film makes up for it with it's characters' charms and a well-told true story.",

This inspiring tale of three black women who defied prejudice is carried by stunning performances from its three leading ladies Taraji P Henson, Janelle Mona\u00e9 and Octavia Spencer.\n\nIt's rare that a biopic about an American triumph doesn't centre on the achievements of white men, but this engaging and entertaining feel good movie, where the visionary thinking of space travel contrasts with the backwards mentality of racial segregation, is a sure fire crowd pleaser. It's an amazing story that deserved to be told.",

As Melfi proved in his previous film, St Vincent, he's good with actors and is a competent storyteller, but he can't resist underlining things that are already obvious. At a time when calls for diverse media dominate the industry, Hidden Figures hedges its bets with a family-friendly commercial solution: warm and fuzzy storytelling that's both progressive and safe. For all of its current touchstones, Hidden Figures feels far too late, both in the recognition these women deserve and the filmmakers' goodhearted but dull approach to their stories. Hidden Figures is an earnest movie, but not a very exciting one. The screenplay feels as engineered as a Gemini rocket launch, with every scene and line carefully calculated. The film aims for the stars but might have gone stratospheric if it cooled its jets ever so slightly. Hidden Figures is engaging, entertaining and enlightening -- but by playing fast and loose with historical fact, it risks blunting some of the story's eye-opening emotional force.\n\nVERDICT: \"In The Zone\" - [Mixed Reaction] These kinds of movies are usually movies that had some good things, but some bad things kept it from being amazing. This rating says buy an ex-rental or a cheap price of the DVD to own. If you consider cinema, ask for people's opinion on the film. (Films that are rated 2.5 or 3 stars)",

To me, they can get as close to perfection as possible. A well-made biopic has the power to shake us to our very core.\n\nHidden Figures proves this beyond the shadow of a doubt. The story of three African-American women, fighting racism, who, against all odds believe in themselves and make their country proud.\n\nWhile telling their story, the film also tackles the issues of gender inequality and racism. Inequality between men and women in general and apartheid between the whites and colored. It seemed like being a black woman in 19th Century America was the worst life you could possibly have.\n\nThis disparity was clearly seen in general public as well as within their space organization NASA. The film also understands that it wants to tell the story of these three women and not the story of racism in America at period of time. So, it never gets too preachy or deviates itself from the subject matter. Hitting all the right notes along the way.\n\nTaraji P. Henson (as Katherine Johnson), Janelle Mon\u00e1e (as Mary Jackson) and Octavia Spencer (as Dorothy Vaughn) were outstanding. A special mention to Mahershala Alia (Colonel Jim Johnson) and my boy Jim Parsons (Paul Stafford) for their side roles. And Kevin Costner (Al Harrison) who gets some of the best lines.\n\nThe directing, editing, visuals, cinematography & set pieces were on-point.\n\nAs for issues, I think they should have dumbed it down a bit. It gets far too technical and mathematical, diving into analytical geometry and whatnot. Also the film doesn't have much re-watching value to it. I don't see myself watching it alone all by myself again. There are no action scenes or plot twists. Just a simple story told in a passionate way.\n\nMaybe I'm nitpicking here. Gather round with your family and watch this if you can. It is well worth your time. You won't be disappointed.\n\n5/5 Stars.",

Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae are two mathematicians and an engineer, respectively, who make important calculations that allow astronaut John Glenn (a much too young Glen Powell) to successfully orbit the earth. Writer-director Theodore Melfi tells the story in broad strokes with no real surprises and the racial dynamic is presented with minimal tension, but it isn't overly inspirational or sentimental. What makes the movie so pleasurable is watching these smart, sassy, confident women use their intelligence to overcome racial prejudice and sexism during the Civil Rights era. Written by Melfi and Allison Schroeder, based on the book by Margot Lee Shetterly. With Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali.",
