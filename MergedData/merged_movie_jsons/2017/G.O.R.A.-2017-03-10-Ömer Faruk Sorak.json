            "content": "Despite a lot of complaints that non-Turks would not find this funny, I did. I have seen it twice now. I do quite enjoy it and find much of it funny, with some parts extremely funny. Granted, a few things were not especially original, or were pretty tired or crude without being humorous to me, but these were minor problems and films like this always have some jokes that don't appeal to everyone. I cannot say I don't like a movie simply because I personally don't like some of the jokes or gags. Overall, the film was quite well-done and most of the jokes or spoofs of culture and films worked quite well.One fun thing is to see this sort of film made from a Turkish perspective, rather than American. It puts a new twist on some things, even jokes that we've seen before or which would have been in an American or other film.In part, I am sure my enjoyment of the film is helped by the fact that, while hardly being fluent in Turkish, I do know some Turkish and am quite familiar with the country. Therefore, while there are a number of very Turkey-specific jokes, I was able to enjoy at least some of them. I would therefore agree that a decent understanding of at least Turkish culture and recent history, if not the language, will enhance one's enjoyment of the film.Other humour in the film seems pretty universal. As a result, there are quite a lot of jokes and spoofs that I know many Americans and Western Europeans would get. Again, while some are tired or crude, many are really quite funny and pulled off quite well.I think that my biggest complaint is that some themes were not taken far enough. For example, more could have been done with the carpet salesman thing since that part was really quite funny and had more potential than the film exploited.In the end, this is a pretty well-made, funny, and entertaining film. It could have been better, but it works well and should provide quite a few laughs, especially if one knows much about Turkey. It's rather silly, but that is pretty much the point, and the silliness here is mostly quite entertaining.Although not really relevant for my discussion, I shall add that this film is also a milestone for Turkish cinema in terms of the special effects and production values for a film of this sort. I think it's important to recognize this, even though I was primarily concerned with giving my opinion of the film's content, etc. Thus, while one may be able to criticize some visuals compared to some big-budget Hollywood films, the production values/special effects are pretty good, especially considering the context.",

            "content": "I have inflicted this film on every house guest for the last two years. Why have I done this? First, because I am exceptionally cruel. Really, that's true. But second, I have done this because it is a very clever film from an unlikely source. How many Turkish films have you seen lately? Okay,\"Once Upon a Time in Anatolia\" should be a must-see for everyone, and you might have stretched to \"Iklimer\" or \"Three Monkeys\", but after that? After that is \"G.O.R.A.\" This film is strangely unappreciated. As I tell all those who fall within my grasp, this celluloid baby is the best Turkish sci-fi comedy ever made. Of course, they retort: how many Turkish sci-fi comedies are there? But that's not the point. Instead, you should prepare yourself for an onslaught of charm from the very talented comedian Cem Yilmaz, who also wrote the film. (Which is probably why he gets to kiss the stunning Ozge Ozberk.) No, it's not perfect- there are a few too many moments of physical comedy with Ozkan Ugur, one fart joke too many with Rasim Oztekin, but overall, it's a great antidote for those who don't expect smart comedy from outside the traditional powerhouses of the international film circuit. And for those of you who don't know - the fourth element is not wood.",

            "content": "Well, first of all, this movie is a good project. There is no science-fiction film in the history of Turkish cinema, and if you think about the budget, which was about 4 Mio. USD and nevertheless huge for Turkish proportions, George Lucas wasted a budget of 125 Mio USD for Star Wars Episode III, then it is the optimum of what has been created.The story is no revolution, but no one ever expected that. Cem Yilmaz realised his vision of \"Turks in space\" and made his work well. His love for details is average.To understand everything in that film, first you gotta be Turkish, since a big part of the humor is based on the street language that Cem Yilmaz is using perfectly. The second thing is, you have to know some US Science-Fiction movies like Star Wars, Matrix or Star Trek. Only the combination of these two requirements makes the movie really funny.G.O.R.A is unusual to the Turkish public, so this is why some people didn't like it I think. I consider this work as new era of special fx in Turkish movies.In the end, it is a solid Turkish space movie.",

            "content": "I saw this movie today and thought from the first scenes that it would be a disappointment, but when Cem Yilmaz (the main actor) showed up the movie became really funny. He is a macho Turkish man who is kidnapped by aliens. The reference to many sci-fi movies is nice, but the real fun comes from the dialogs Cem Yilmaz makes. It's the first time I saw a Turkish film with so many special effects, that is great. The only bad sides are that it makes just to many jokes about homosexuals which becomes boring and the hero saves the planet just to easy. But it's a comedy, not the filming of a book so that is understandable. The most hilarious part is at the end when Arif (Cem Yilmaz) jumps in the air and makes a karate move like in Matrix with the camera turning around him. The only difference is, this time he makes a very strange move!hehe",

            "content": "Arif is a typical Turkish bloke selling carpets to tourists in Western Turkey. He is also obsessed with creating fake pictures of UFOs. Then he gets abducted by aliens from the GORA planet. After all there is no rule that says aliens can only abduct people from the USA. Nor is there a rule that says that only Americans can make contact with extra-terrestrial life forms. So what happens if aliens abduct a Turkish carpet seller ?Basically, GORA is a good piss take of the more popular sci-fi movies such as Starwars and Matrix. And that's fine with me, because I believe both Starwars (feel the Farce) and Matrix (I know Kung Fu) are extremely overrated movies. The sense of humour in GORA is Turkish. That is neither a praise nor an insult. It is just Turkish. The subtitles don't help either. For some reason Turkish movie producers hire awful translators who sometimes even mix German with English. Translation between languages that are as different from each other as Turkish and English requires slightly more than a word-by-word correspondence. I hereby offer my services free of charge. Just ask. Had the subtitles been any better the movie could have achieved some international recognition as a comedy movie. Turkish speakers should definitely watch this movie. They'll have a good laugh. Non-Turks should give it a try.",

He mostly uses his daily experiences in his scripts and plays. He also used some of his play jokes in the movie too.",

            "review_title": "Great science fiction comedy / spoof",
            "content": "This film parodies various earlier films and is so joke-driven that it often comes close to breaking the fourth wall, but it also works as a 'straight' science fiction comedy. It is based on the tried and tested premise of an everyday character suddenly being catapulted into a space opera plot. Earlier classics based on this premise include Turist \u00d6mer Uzay Yolu'nda (1973) (also known as 'Turkish Star Trek') and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1981).The film has high production values, which makes it stand out among Turkish films (at least compared to earlier films). Apparently it was only marketed in Turkey, which is a pity because most of the humor is international. Some of it pokes fun at specific Turkish circumstances, but can be understood by an international audience. The few untranslatable elements, such as the weird pun that motivated the movie's very name, could easily have been glossed over in the translation.My only complaint is that for my taste, the film contains far too many jokes related to male homosexuality. Fortunately they are not as blatant, pervasive and obnoxious as those in Dreamship Surprise: Period 1, a far worse science fiction comedy / spoof that also came out in 2004. (This German film enjoyed some limited international marketing and I believe is much better known internationally than G. O. R. A. is.)",

This one has been the greatest work of Cem Yilmaz, a collection of his observations and witty comments on Turkish lifestyle. When you ask people about a quote from Hababam Sinifi, almost everyone in the country will remember and show their appreciation of the work. Just as Hababam Sinifi, GORA has been the reference point for many jokes that has been used by all age groups in Turkey. I for myself watched it at least a dozen times and still can find novel jokes and anecdotes while watching it. It is full of both subtle and explicit jokes in every scene. It would not be fair to expect a great cinematic experience from this very movie as scenario and the rest is secondary to the jokes, and it is an early work of Cem Yilmaz and his crew together. However, if you want to study Turkish culture, this movie will be one of the greatest examples of the society.",

            "content": "What are your expectations when you go to see a film? The most noticeable characteristic of Turkish people is that they are able to subtly critise their own culture through comedy and this is what the film has done superbly. When I read general reviews of this film, including the ones on this site, I can't help but see how Cem Yilmaz has quite cleverly and creatively worked a variety of cultural characteristics into a fictional theme. I believe that viewers who have reviewed the film in a light of this have done it justice... and come on, if there are so many 'Arif's out there, how can we still question whether or not there are extra- terrestrial life forms out there too! :-)This is a highly successful and thoroughly hilarious film. When I walked out of the cinema, it didn't even cross my mind to analyze the film in the way I usually would.. I mean why should I? I really don't believe the writer or director even thought of doing this themselves. it's not 'persona' or anything. I experienced two hours of solid laughter. I mean what else would I have wished for? (When I think back though, the only down side was I didn't buy enough pop corn...:-))Personally, I didn't feel the need to overstress the superb quality of the visual effects either. Yes they were surprisingly fantastic, very 'Hollywood', but this didn't add or take away from the film in any way. Put it this way, if a song is beautifully written then it will sound great even if you were to just serenade it. But if the song is crap/ badly written, then even the London Philharmonic Orchestra can't do much with it believe me!In short, this film must not be missed! Leave all your expectations at home and don't watch it with any intention of reviewing it... just sit back & enjoy.",

What he did so far is a great achievement and Turkish people knows that. He primarily makes stand-up shows but he is also busy with writing and acting; in which he is very successful in my opinion.The movie here looks like it's all around Cem Yilmaz, but we must say that the other people of the movie did their job just as successful.This a sci-fi and a comedy movie. Cem Yilmaz plays a typical Turkish guy who runs a carpet shop. He is also busy with producing fake UFO photos. Then he is taken by an alien spaceship and transported to the planet Gora.The situation of a typical Turkish guy in a sci-fi environment was quite funny for me, but also I guess that a non-Turkish viewer would find it just as funny. Other characters are acting quite well. Ceku (Ozge Ozberk) is gorgeous.This is the biggest budget used in a Turkish movie so far, so don't expect poor scenes behind.",

The serious situations are mixed with a lot of jokes, which I enjoyed a lot. The story is intriguing, the characters are realistic and original. This movie is counterpoint of all movies, which are made too seriously without the necessary depth/reason, which we are able to find in many funny movies. In G.O.R.A. movie we are able to find enough human sense and wits. The relation with the Matrix and other fantasy movies is made with easiness and only in service of the screenplay.

Absolutely, it was a huge success and spawned 2 sequels.\nDid I enjoy it? Absolutely not.G.O.R.A tells the tale of a Turkish carpet salesman who is abducted by aliens and made into a slave. Through his adventure he meets various wacky characters and deeply annoyed me from start to finish.You see the film is a comedy, a very camp comedy and unlike anything I've seen come out of Turkey before it. This is not exactly a standard Turkish film, they really gambled on this one. I'm glad it worked out for them, but I scratch my head in confusion as to how/why.The jokes are frequent, this is quickfire humor but very few of the jokes hit their mark. The jokes are silly, puerile, and I definitely wasn't the demographic. Sure I like goofy childish humor, I'd class Baseketball (1998) as one of my favorite films but this was unfunny and overkill.Considering the budget everything is ugly, the cast join our lead in being deeply annoying and the movie does it's best to parody Hollywood and some of the most well known sci-fi movies such as The Matrix (1999) and The Fifith Element (1997). Sadly in doing so they embarrass themselves, original humor clearly isn't their forte and they have even less acumen for parody.The film isn't devoid of redeeming qualities but it's certainly very niche.The Good:Opening was simply unfunnyA small handful of laughsThe Bad:Vast majority of jokes are unfunny and childishLead walks a fine line of funny and really really annoyingToo long",

One day, his dreams come true, he meets real aliens, but as a twist of luck, those aliens are evil, and captures earth people to work them as slaves in the mines of planet GORA. Logar (Cem Y\u00fdlmaz) is the evil commander of the entire GORA army, and wishes to marry the daughter (\u00d6zge \u00d6zberk) of the president of the planet (Cezmi Bask\u00fdn) for the ultimate power & glory. Logar is holding a grudge against Turks, for his father is an explorer, has visited Earth once, only to be mistreated by Turkish farmers. Arif has a full agenda. He has to escape from prison, stop a fireball approaching GORA, harness his real inside power with the help of the wise guy Garavel (\u00d6zkan U\u00f0ur), help the lovely princess find his long-lost 'real' father, stop the evil plans of commander Logar and at the end, find a vessel to return to earth. In an addition, he is in now in love with the princess, and the feelings are mutual!As a whole, GORA is a mixture of action \u0096 adventure and comedy. Blended with seriously distinguished special effects, paradises movies like Star Wars, The Fifth Element and The Matrix. An additional flavor is the integration of Turkish lifestyle and the way of life to a planet light years away from earth. As one of the best comedians of Turkey, Cem Y\u00fdlmaz has a great success in plotting the outline and a very successful characterization of the two main and opposite characters of the movie - the evil commander Logar and the funny, practical thinking carpet salesman Arif. The supporting cast is also well chosen, helping the audience feel the overwhelming presence of the lifestyle and characters of an alien planet.Special effects, flashing costumes and extremely sophisticated make-up increases the value of the movie as a whole, making GORA one of the best produced space adventures of all times. The balance of action and comedy, Turkish humor and its international perception is well applied, and the general rules of making a quality cinema production are strictly followed. As a faithful movie fan, I would suggest GORA to every audience who want to go to a movie, have hours of fun and laugh and leave the theater with a happy smile on the face. Just a humble reminder, do not believe all of what they told you on other space movies. There is at least a planet out there, whose inhabitants are funny, incompetent and less evil than the evil trade federation, the sith, the goa'uld, the wraith and the cylons",

It was a real surprise, that this movie was even better than Cem Yilmaz's comedy acting in \"Bir Tat, bir doku...\"!But there are some negative points for the \"foreign\"-movie visitors: The humor is all around Turkish-lifestyle, so they maybe don't understand most of the funny lines and acting. Further the subtitling was really bad! Most of the movie was inside the G.O.R.A. prison and so it was not able to read the white subtitles on white background. A slight shadow under the text would helped a lot.Sure this movie doesn't has the emotional deepness of for example Vizontele, but it's a funny movie and far better than some German pendants like \"Traumschiff Surprise\".I don't want to loose much words about the plot itself, because other users did this already very well, but I can say, that almost EVERY minute in this movie had jokes, that were so awesome, that you were not able to NOT jump out of your seat :) Especially the scene, where arif and ceku where creating some kind of romantic atmosphere and bob marley faruk farted while he was sleeping right next to them. I know, it sound very childish, but the overall acting and the reactions from cem yilmaz were so unbelievable funny, I was not able to hold my tears from laughing. *In fact I hate fart-jokes and crappy fart-movies like \"Nutty Professor II: The Klumps\" and others...*Although most of the environments were done very well, sometimes you were able to see not so well done background images and some scenes were used twice... But nothing, that would distract you from the main aspect of the movie: Making you laugh :)",

The biggest disadvantage of GORA is that the filmmakers spend too much money and effort. This is why it's clear that they can't delete any scenes. If they did that I'm sure GORA could be funnier movie. Cem Yilmaz is a very very unique person. While I'm watching the movie sometimes I thought that Cem Yilmaz plays like in a home-video.

            "content": "I was much more impressed with \"Vizontele,\" the last collaboration between Cem Yilmaz and the director of \"GORA.\" But, \"GORA\" has its funny moments and production-wise, it is a considerable improvement over Turkish films in past generations. As a Turkish-American, I have a slightly different view of Turkish films than most people who live in Turkey. I have liked some Turkish films like \"Baalayka\" and \"Polizei\" more- neither of which are popular films, but I have been slightly less impressed with domestic box office hits like \"Ucurtmayanlari Yurmasinlar/Don't Let Them Shoot the Kites\" (1989). I think there are some major problems with GORA as the last message poster from Ankara pointed out. The film is way too long, and there are far too many bathroom jokes. And, though the film has better production values, Cem Yilmaz is not quite the exceptional talent that the late Turkish comic actor Kemal Sunal was. (Sunal was in \"Polizei\" and was to star in \"Baalayka\" before dying of a heart attack preparing for a flight to work on the film!) But, \"GORA\" does illustrate Turkey's dilemma of trying to find a place in the world. The aliens in this sci-fi/comedy seem to show how Turkish people see the outside world. And, there are some funny moments such as when Yilmaz pretends to be a sensitive man to woo an attractive alien woman. It is also funny to see people from outer space speaking fluent Turkish! Yes, I'm still laughing over that one! Unfortunately, I don't think the film's humor would carry over to viewers outside Turkey who are unfamiliar with the complicated cultural traits of the country. It is for this reason that Sunal is deservedly an icon in Turkey, but not a familiar figure in other nations. When it comes to Turkish humor, the rest of the world will sadly never get it.",

Many of the jokes are based on ordinary, sometimes vulgar, slangs that I rarely appreciate as funny. In some scenes the film looks like rather a science fiction with no humorous aspect at all. The references to other films are far from being smart; even I could hardly grasp what was funny in some references. On the other hand, the cast was quite successful. Only \u00d6zge \u00d6zberk (as Ceku) somewhat reveals her lack of experience; but her charming look in several beautiful dresses compensate this. I also liked the costumes. Picturing was OK despite the focusing seemed odd to me in some scenes.Cem Yilmaz displays a good performance and I believe that the film would be unbearable without him. But it is impossible to praise his achievement as a writer. The scenario have not fulfilled my expectations from Yilmaz, who could have definitely done a better job.

I had no idea that it is one of the most famous Turkish movies ever, I just knew that it is a Turkish sci-fi, something I've never seen before.Now, this may be the source of my issues with G.O.R.A. I know virtually nothing about the Turkish culture, so it's possible that I didn't understand some of the jokes intended for the local audience. Still, a good comedy should have at least some jokes that everyone will find funny, no matter their background. For me, G.O.R.A. doesn't have this. Yes, there are numerous references to the classics such as Star Wars, The Fifth Element, and the Matrix, and they are all fine, but I wouldn't call them funny as such. Then there are jokes about farting and poor sexual double entendres, which I found cringeworthy.What I liked about the movie was the general design of the world. The aliens costumes were really interesting and I felt they really helped to build the characters which otherwise may have been pretty flat. The special effects may not be the best in the world, but for this type of movie they were enough.\nI can't really say anything about the acting, as I felt like the actors weren't given much to work with. Almost all characters are one-dimensional and none of them has much character.

You know, I just can't understand that there are so much people around here that seem to find Gora so incredibly funny. Sure, it has its moments, like the little man that is neglected throughout the entire movie or the machine blowing wind in Matrix-style, but most of the time the humour is so immature and simple. And what's with all those old fashioned gay-jokes!? It must be years ago that a Western comedy made jokes about gay's just because they are gay...Watch the trailer, than you won't have to see the movie itself. It isn't worth your time, though it isn't that bad...:)",

            "content": "A rare Turkish attempt to mimic Hollywood production got one thing right - the trailer is infinitely better than the film itself. Over time it has taken on a life of its own on the Internet, with a couple of ostensibly clever jabs at \"Matrix\" and \"Star Wars\". See it and that's about as much fun as you will get out of the entire feature. See the rest if you think it'll help you infer something about Turkish culture. Beware, though: you might come to a conclusion that the Turks have quite a low grade sense of humor and that practically everybody can be a comedian there.\"G.O.R.A.\" tries to spoof the Western Sci-Fi genre. It fails so badly at it that the only thing it achieves is to make one appreciate the spoofed material even more. The jokes that worked in the trailer just fell flat in the actual film because they came off random and gratuitous, without a proper set-up.The space between is filled with inanity and randomness, as far as the viewer accustomed to the coherence of Western films is concerned. Characterization is poor and unconvincing, plot points are disjointed as if several story lines were forcibly merged into one, pop references are crude and literal (\"I've seen it in the Fifth Element!\"), the fourth wall is smugly being broken (\"This goes out to you, Hollywood!\"), there are unnecessary flashbacks that slow down the plot, there is a heavy reliance on shallow stereotyping to elicit humor, and the main character, a sleazy everyman who just can't shut the hell up, is one of the most insufferable leads I've ever seen on screen. I'd feel sorry for one Cem Yilmaz who plays him, hadn't he been the one who wrote the daft script in the first place. In an act of vanity he also took up three more roles here and has only achieved something of note with the role of main villain.The production value, as seen in the trailer, largely holds up throughout the film. Visibly, most of the budget went into the special effects, the costumes and the sets. However, already at the cinematography level things fall apart, as one can observe the uneven color grading, mistakes in the lighting setup and so on. Furthermore, the art direction is overly glossy so everything looks more like a commercial than a feature film, but all of that is at least passable. What is uniformly bad is the cast, who are simply lost in space, and the director who doesn't know what he wants out of the scene and the actors, has little understanding of camera positioning and movement, and has no knack whatsoever for comedic timing and pace. The overall feel one gets is that, while there is always something happening on the screen, the plot never gains a momentum.Perhaps all this is just a cultural thing and perhaps one has to live in Turkey to be in on all the nuances and jokes. As far as I'm told, \"G.O.R.A.\" broke the box-office records in the native country. But it has a clear ambition to speak to the Western audience as well and, seen through that scope, one must admit that by far the funniest thing about this \"comedy\" is the undeservedly high rating on the IMDb.",

A plot of a movie can always become a point of discussion, but in G.O.R.A.'s case, movie critics and the audience should not blur their minds with these arguments. The quality of special effects / film budget ratio is so high, that the post-production stage of this movie should be carefully analyzed.If an independent production team can produce a movie with this quality, the entire Turkish / East European movie makers should start utilizing the use of technology in their productions. After all, when we are talking about developing the Independent Movie Industry, isn't it about attracting attention? For years, twisted plots and boring old scenarios were re-made into movies over and over again, forcing the average movie-goers to watch mainstream movies just for their visual effects. G.O.R.A. has nothing less than National Lampoon's sarcastic view, or nothing less than the visuals of an $ 50 mil. Hollywood sci-fi. Now G.O.R.A is playing all over Europe.

This film just has the famous scenes that are copied from great Hollywood productions that are modified just to add a sense of humor. Cem Yilmaz is a great comedian but not a director. The poor quality jokes about the matrix were just \"disgusting\". We could also see nearly all of the funny moments at the film in its trailer. A very high level of advertising made \"GORA\" to be viewed at the most of the cinema halls. Even some of the cinemas only show \"GORA\" but it is not worth it. People watch this film because everybody else watches. It is obvious that no one would remember this film after a year or two.",

            "content": "The film is really fantastic, the aliens abduct a Turkish man, and he is a carpet salesman in ,probably ,Cappadocia, he is brilliantly intelligent and also funny, but this is somehow because that he is so pure and naturally behaving even though he's in another planet named G.O.R.A. One of the funniest and nostalgic scenes of the film is the one with Commodore 64. No Pentiums and some sort of that stuff, only and only the Commodore 64 the greatest computer:))))I laughed for minutes when i watched that scene. if you want to see a science fiction movie mixed with humor go and see this one.The way it approaches to subject is so much different than most other science fiction movies. I give 9 over 10. Go Cem Yilmaz go, who catches you be (English mixed with Turkish:)))",

            "content": "I think that, this movie is one of the best comedy shot; interesting and good screenplay good jokes but... using of many swearwords makes a movie a little bit pushing. Cem Yilmaz (also writer and producer of that movie) plays very good but, although he had some experiences as actor in some movies, he is still not enough to become a player on world stage. Other players are successful as well, and I think the choice of actors and actresses are well done. Screenplay and technology used during shots are quite new and expensive in the T\u00fcrk cinema but, with increasing income the producers will tend to use better and better (thoug expensive) technologies in their films. So as a result of my comment I can conclude that although some lack of experience of movie makers in T\u00fcrkiye (especially in that kind of comedy), I believe it will lead the T\u00fcrk cinema to a better stage... Let's see what Cem Yilmaz will do in Part II :)",

            "content": "Cem Yilmaz is a genius for sure. However you need to know Turkish culture people very well to understand most of the jokes in the movie. He is able to pick up sentimental and mostly overreacting in the public. Especially ones who have really much confident while talking. Many dialogues more than funny. Most of the time I feel pain in my stomach. It's a sci fiction with lots of affection in it. Great job man",

            "content": "It is hard to be Turk. Our nation likes exaggeration. One day you are a patriot the other day you maybe a traitorous. It's same in arts also. Most of the fans of the film will forget it so soon you wouldn't believe. I don't think it's the best Turkish comedy film. It's an insult for our film industry, to say that. Please realize that \"the most popular\" doesn't mean \"the best\". We can't compare the box offices to say \"the best\" movie. I believe most of the people would say another movie as the best movie, although \"titanic\" is at the top of world all time box office. G.O.R.A. is not a movie yet; it's just Cem Yilmaz's stand-up on theaters. I feel sorry for the director....",
