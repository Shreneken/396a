            "review_title": "Amazing work of art, telling a melancholic tale",
            "content": "This is one-of-a-kind movie and definitely a must for lovers of Van Gogh. I studied art, therefore I was very interested in seeing how they managed to produce new paintings using his technique. The result is visually striking. You can actually experience some of Van Gogh's paintings coming to life, which is in itself pretty amazing.However, a movie must also have a strong script, a good story to go with the visual. The plot is about Armand Roulin, son of Joseph Roulin - two frequent subjects of Van Gogh's portraits. In fact, the whole Roulin family, inclusive of mum Augustine and her other two children were painted several times by Van Gogh, while in Arles.Joseph was Van Gogh's postman and in the movie he entrusts Armand to deliver his last letter to brother Theo. Vincent and Theo's letters were published at the beginning of the last century, shedding light on their affectionate relationship, but not about Vincent's demise.Therefore, Armand sets out to investigate Vincent's last days. The tone is somber and melancholic, somehow clashing with the beautiful visuals. Van Gogh comes across as an enigmatic man who could be sweet and full joy one moment and despondent the next - maybe suffering from bi-polar disorder, but we'll never know.The plot develops a bit slowly in the end we do not know much more of what we knew at the beginning, but for sure we can retain the memory of this fantastic pictorial voyage.",

The paintings are all in Van Gogh's style are they are a beautiful backdrop that brings incredible life to the film in a way that no other style possible could.But there is much more to Loving Vincent than the art, it is a riveting story that dives into who Vincent Van Gogh was as a man and the mystery surrounding his death. It unfolds in the same manner as \"Citizen Kane\" with the posthumous exploration into a person through talking to the people who knew him. It is engrossing with excellent voice work and incredibly smooth animation and movement.",

What I found amazing about this movie was the imaginative approach that was taken to unravel his life and work. So many details were revealed that I had no idea of, and put into such interesting context. The choice of actors was brilliant and we see how close they resemble the actual people during the credit roll at the end of the film - also highly imaginative. I love the rich colours, the Cerulean blue and bright yellows. Truly a starry night! Don't miss.",

            "content": "This is an astonishing feat. When animated shorts are nominated for Academy Awards, they frequently run 10 to 15 minutes. How a group of artists were able to \"paint\" the scenes and incorporate great paintings into a really fine story of full movie length is beyond my comprehension. Van Gogh is dead and so is his brother, Theo. It is thought that he took his own life for whatever reason. Lord knows he had enough issues, including his utter genius. A family friend is dispatched to deliver a last letter from the great artist to his brother, but when the friend arrives, he find Theo is dead. This guy has his own issues and at first tires of his task, but when he finds that there is some suspicious stuff relating to the \"suicide,\" he becomes entrenched in solving the case. A running theme is that Van Gogh had no weight because of his lack of commercial success and, beside that, he was weird. As the friend gets into the case, we get to know that there were people who cared about him and liked him, but they also didn't do much to hold him up. As others have said, this is an amazing expression of the painter''s world, put before us through his paintings. One other thing. Don't leave the theater too soon because there are some great closing items that one shouldn't miss.",

            "review_title": "Van Gogh's art comes alive",
            "content": "This beautiful work has made history in the genre of Animation cinema - a precious gift from devoted film-makers. The story is well known - a matter of history. Vincent painted the portrait of Joseph Roulin, Postmaster of Arles. The film tells us the story of Vincent's life and last months before his death on 29 July, 1890 (aged 37) from a self-inflicted gun-shot wound, via the device of the postmaster's son being sent on a mission to deliver a letter from Vincent to his brother, which has been returned. Vincent and his brother Theo were very close, and Theo supported Vincent with regular gifts of money, and painting canvas and tubes of paint. The postmaster Roulin knew and loved Vincent, because these two loving brothers kept up a very frequent correspondence. These letters have been published elsewhere and make very moving reading. The son of Roulin goes to Paris, and to Auvers-sur-Oise where Vincent had been in care after he had an emotional breakdown, and talks to people who knew him. He is at first unwilling, but becomes interested, then passionate to find out the truth of the man whom he is now starting to fully appreciate. The remarkable aspect of this film is that the entire story, 95 minutes of it, is told in hand-painted oil paintings, done in the style of Vincent's own work. Scenes begin with an image that Vincent himself painted and if viewers are familiar with all his works, they will recognize the people and the places. But now they are moving, they are speaking, they are telling their stories, and their impressions of Vincent, the man. Some were fond of him, some ridiculed him. There are various points of view.Technically the film \"Loving Vincent\" is a wonder of animation. One hundred artists in two countries, (Poland and Greece) working in Vincent's own style contributed full colour paintings for \"the present\" and black and white paintings for \"the past\" as the story is being told by the people who knew Vincent.The film is made up of 853 'shots', and each one began with a first frame of a full painting on canvas board. As the animation photography was done in 12 frames per second, the first painting, would then be photographed, then painted over, with each gradual change to certain details or all of it, until the last frame of the shot. (This is in place of the use of animation cels, which could not be applied in this style of work.) At the end of the 'shot' the film-makers were left with an oil-painting on canvas board, of the last frame. So at the end of filming 853 paintings remained, and 200 are being auctioned off, and many have already sold, (as can be seen from the films own website) although at the time of writing the film has not yet premiered in the USA. The size of the works was usually 67cm by 49cm. Bear in mind that for one hour of film, 43,200 paintings were required, and you will begin to see the extraordinary ambition of this project. Additionally 90 design paintings were created in the planning stages during the year before shooting started. The purpose of these was to define the style in which the artists would all re-create Vincent's style of painting and make it move, live and breathe. 65,000 painted frames in oils were made for the whole film. The story moves along briskly and is full of wonderful characters (the people in Vincent's life). The dialogue of the characters is full of expression, as are the faces, and the characters have been created to really \"live\" for us. This was done by casting well known and excellent actors in the main roles, and filming them in live-action, then using those 'normal' cinematic images for a basis of the key paintings for each 'shot'. As the film went on, I recognized (from other films) certain of the painted faces of the real actors, who are also giving voice to the painted characters on the soundtrack. This type of animation has never been done before, and as it took seven years to make the film, it might never be done again. The ingenious planning of how to actually do it is brilliant and has been a great success.Vincent, who suffered, from what we now call bi-polar disease, was an intelligent, deeply sensitive man, who had a sad childhood in a strict bourgeouis family, and was something of a misfit. He showed immense natural art talent. This can be seen clearly and unmistakably by looking at his early drawing. Later he used brush techniques that imitated the 'signature marks' in his pen and ink works. He was understood and saw visual texture.From Paris Vincent went to Provence, and lived in Arles. He begged his friend Gaugin to come and join him. Vincent was over-joyed but after a few months, things went wrong between them, and Vincent seemed to become very distressed. When Gaugin departed, he was inconsolable. After the famous incident of cutting of his own ear in his distress, he went into care of Dr Gachet in Auvers, where he found a kindred spirit in Gachet, who loved art, and recovered. There he did quite a few more strong drawings and paintings. Vincent saw the world in a kind of almost violent motion and most of his works, drawings and paintings show this. It's as if the wind was visible to him in the air itself, not only in the resulting movements of trees, and fields of grain, or the moving sea.He never sold a painting in his own lifetime, but gave away some, and sent many to his brother Theo who attempted to sell them in his Paris art gallery. And yet now his works hold the record as being the most expensive ever sold \u2013 which happened in modern times.",

            "review_title": "Real Cinematic Art",
            "content": "Cinema has always been a gloried artwork and we have much more authentic proof in astounding Loving Vincent.An animated construction entirely brought to life by oil paintings, is\u00a0 quintessential proof that cinema has still barely scratched the surface of its reaches. Loving Vincent is landmark event for animation and even biographical storytelling through its majestic vision at the last days of Vincent Van Gogh.Set a after the death of fabled painter, Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) is possessed with a letter from Van Gogh to his brother Theo before his death, and begins the journey to deliver it. While on call, Roulin encounters all the people\u00a0close to Vincent before is death gradually trying to put the pieces of what cause his sudden suicide. From this we are taken back to key moments of Van Gogh's life mesmerizingly displayed through the living oil paintings.Generated by 65,000 paintings by over a 100 artist, Loving Vincent is living work of art. First shot as a live action depiction then adapted into paintings, the immersive gallery of scenes is a first in new format of animation. Directors: Dorota Kobiela, and Hugh Welchman take Van Gogh's own artistry into his own biography (almost), from Citizen Kane style narrative, assessing and celebrating the life of one of the worlds if not the most famous painter. From this production becomes transporting cinema experience into the world of Van Gogh and an enchanting watch of magnificent painting and animation.Of course what is the fundamental strength of Loving Vincent is its captivating artwork which for every moment is spectacular, and then you have the real narrative of Van Gogh's last days which on its own is an affectionate journey. Even if you don't not much about the life of Van Gogh this is an enthralling experience.The monumental presence of the paintings is consistently exceptional with wonderful detail and creation put into it. One of the sensational efforts for the film is its\u00a0sketch of the real actors, making them instantly recognisable on screen, bringing their performance into the art. Although our eyes are set on visual presence, Clint Mansell's score is also a tear-jerking atmosphere throughout the film, capturing the melancholy as well as joy of Van Gogh.Loving Vincent is a visual sensation, proving the amazing talent that animation brings to the screen. This is by far one of the most significant films of the year and is must see experience, especially for art students.",

            "content": "As a Van Gogh fan, I was waiting for so long to see this movie. I thought it would be about his life but it came out to be something different. A postman was asking his son, Armand, to deliver the last letter of Van Gogh written to his brother, Theo. As first I thought it was a piece of the ending such as a flashforward and the story would recommence but it didn't. During the movie I discovered how the death of Van Gogh is as exciting as his life. Although I knew how unfortunate his life was, I didn't know the real reason behind his suicide. We were told he was just a crazy artist. I felt utterly sad to learn that he cared much about his brother and vice versa. The movie, at the beginning, comes very strange as it was taken using paintings of his own impressionist style. However the story comes attractive and you find yourself questioning his death. I would like to congratulate all the artists who contributed to this movie. Great piece of art and nice ending song!",

I loved the idea that the audience is looking through the eyes of an artist--how an artist might see. If that kind of thing interests you, you should go see this film in the theater. It is stunning.As for the narrative? Well, now, if you know anything about the history of Van Gogh's life, you know it wasn't terribly happy. There is a lot of drinking and smoking and despair to go around. They employ a plot device involving a letter, and it works. Do not go in thinking there will be thundering revelations about the life of the artist. But it offers some quiet insights about some of the subjects of his paintings, and I really loved this.If you are familiar with Van Gogh's works and appreciate his aesthetics, you owe it to yourself to go.

            "content": "I guess you just can't fight Disney in Hollywood. Did I hear right that the Motion Picture Academy considers Coco to be a better movie than Loving Vincent? I am still scratching my head wondering how a run of the mill kid's film could possibly be better than a true artistic masterpiece. Is it because oil painting is such a primitive technology compared to computer-generated animation? Yes, animating with oils results in slightly jerky animation. Never mind that. Just back and watch how impressionist art becomes a living, moving medium to portray art history. Loving Vincent was a labour of love, not the product of data miners and corporate boardroomsToo many other reviews on IMDB have repeated the storyline but that's not what Vincent is all about. The storyline is simply a vehicle to move us from one famous Van Gogh to another while revealing a little bit of the history and the people and scenes Vincent painted. That makes the art of Van Gogh accessible as well as allowing us to understand his struggles with madness and poverty. That makes this that rare item, an art film that's entertaining as well.Even though the story is the least important aspect of Loving Vincent, the screen writing leaves us with a mystery. Perhaps Vincent didn't commit suicide. Perhaps he was shot either deliberately or accidentally by what we would today call the town bully. See Loving Vincent and decide for yourself.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. For those skeptics who scoff when filmmaking is described as an art form and labor of love, co- directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman invite you to take in their nearly decade-in-the-making project. It's the first fully hand-painted on canvas feature film - experimental filmmaking crafted by more than 100 artists and including an estimated 130 paintings, with 65,000 individual shots/frames. The spectacular visuals were created by painting over the images \u0085 both of actors performing scenes and van Gogh's paintings. By adding to and amending images, even 10 times or more, the scenes come to life with movement and a pulsating psychedelic feel. The familiar colors of his paintings create a level of connection, while black & white images are used for flashbacks and reenactments. Though we have never seen this look on screen before (this goes beyond Linklater's WAKING LIFE), the stunning visuals are accompanied by what can be described as a detective story or murder/suicide mystery. It picks up in 1891, one year after van Gogh's suspicious death. A local Arles postman holds one last letter from Vincent to his beloved brother Theo. Having held onto it for much too long, he asks his son Armand Roulin to hand-deliver the letter to Theo. Sporting the yellow blazer so recognizable from his portrait, the angry and skeptical Armand heads to Paris. Little does he know, this is only the beginning of his journey \u0085 a journey that finds him researching Vincent's life and a journey that helps him discover more about himself.There have been many movies made focusing on this amazing artist: LUST FOR LIFE (1956), VINCENT (1987), VINCENT & THEO (1990), and VAN GOGH (1991). This one is filled with contrasting and conflicting stories, theories and recollections, and descriptions of events from those who crossed paths with the artist on a daily basis. We listen right along with Armand as he spends time in Avers-sur-Oise \u0085 where Vincent lived, painted, and died.Many of the actors involved are recognizable even in this artistic format: Chris O'Dowd is the postman, Douglas Booth is Armand, John Sessions plays art supplier Pete Tanguy, Eleanor Thompson is the innkeeper's daughter Adaline, Jerome Flynn is the controversial Dr. Gachet, Saoirse Ronan is Gachet's daughter Margarita (recognizable from her piano portrait), Helen McCrory plays the disgruntled Gachet housekeeper, Aidan Turner is the boatman, and Robert Gulaczyk is Vincent. Since these folks were all part of van Gogh's artwork, we are fascinated to see them come to \"life\". Vincent van Gogh picked up a brush for the first time at age 28. He was dead at age 37, and left behind approximately 800 paintings of portraits and landscapes \u2013 many among the most famous pieces in the world today. Did he try to commit suicide as he claimed or was there a more sinister explanation for his death? Of course the filmmakers only hint at possible answers and can't solve a mystery that is approaching two centuries. Understanding the man is challenging, and perhaps our best hope is through the work he left behind. This is a compelling cinematic experience and we have certainly benefited from the filmmaker's labor of love. Clint Mansell's score leans heavily on strings and piano, and is perfect accompaniment for the story. One could question the closing credits use of Lianne La Havas' version of \"Vincent\" (renamed \"Starry Starry Night\") rather than Don McLean's, but one mystery per day is plenty. Spot the paintings, play detective, and mostly enjoy the visuals built on the works of a complex, talented, and tragic figure.",

The overall experience is ultimately quite sad and tragic--fitting, of course, for what van Gogh went through in his relatively brief lifetime, and especially during his very brief time painting what turned out to be his masterpieces. This particular view of his life left me wanting to read more on what happened in his final days, curious to know more facts, and also sparked my wanting to revisit his paintings after long years of not having viewed them. It rekindled the feelings I had when I first studied and enjoyed them decades ago. I do recommend the film for anyone interested in van Gogh, or the creative process in general.

            "content": "Film critics tend to talk down on a film when it seems like the core idea of the film is a gimmick. Three-dimensional movies were the talk of the town about 10-15 years ago and have now become an annoyance to many. Loving Vincent is the newest film to try something new in terms of how it tells its story. Being completely painted by hand, this movie moves along as if it had been animated about 60 years ago. A more recent comparison would be to say it looks like A Scanner Darkly, but I truly feel this film's much more unique than even that. This is a wonderfully engaging premise and even without that aspect, here's why I believe everyone needs to see this film, even just based on the portraits alone.Loving Vincent tells the story of Armand, a young man who has been tasked with the devastating venture of delivering Vincent Van Gogh's final letter. Upon arrival of the town that Van Gogh ultimately met his untimely end, Armand finds himself incredibly interested in the mystery surrounding this death. Becoming more of an investigation film than a simple journey, Loving Vincent takes you on a ride that's full of insight and powerful moments between characters. I didn't think I would've been so moved by this movie, but the performances/voiceover work was truly astounding, sucking me right into this beautiful portrait of a film.It's one thing to commend this film for having truly breathtaking visuals, but that's also the understatement of the year. This movie blows away any animated film from last year in terms of being uniquely made. From the nods to Van Gogh's classic works, to the motion and dissolves between scenes, everything about this film felt seamless. That being said, there's a large obstacle that many viewers will have to get over as soon as the film begins as well, being the fact that it's entirely painted by hand. This wonderful aspect of the movie will definitely be off-putting to some, due to the fact that it's the first film of its kind and may be bizarre to look at. For myself, I found it absolutely fascinating, plain and simple.As someone who prefers other forms of art than paintings, I do admire a great piece of art, regardless of the medium. This movie explores a life that pretty much everyone has heard of at some point in time, and I must admit, I didn't know this story was as complex of a mystery as this movie suggests it is. From motivational speeches about life and the universe to questions brought up in a philosophical way, I was incredibly immersed in each and every one of the scenes throughout this film. There's hardly any downtime because every line of dialogue progresses this story forward at a rapid rate.In the end, Loving Vincent may not be for everyone, especially due to its unique look, but the story itself is something I believe everyone needs to see. There is a scene that closes out the movie that I still have playing over and over in my head. As I mentioned many times, this movie is filled with memorable lines of dialogue that truly makes you think about life itself and the universe surrounding us. This may seem biased and this particular reaction will surely not hit everyone the way it hit me, but I found this to be a remarkable picture. I fear this movie will go fairly unnoticed, which is a shame because literally, every aspect of this film is wondrous to behold. This is one of my favorite films of 2017.",

            "content": "This is a must-see film for any Van Gogh fanatic or indeed, anyone who is passionate about art. It is innovative and visually striking, and the loving time and attention that has been devoted to the art is clear and obvious throughout.The story itself is not to be repeated here and many people know or believe that they know the Van Gogh story (thanks to his numerous letters he is one of the great artists that we can claim to have a deeper insight into).Where the film struggles is the plot. First of all it's a retelling of a story that many people know. It's clear that the premise was wanting to use the art in a particular way - but actually the story line, the plot, is the secondary consideration.I question how historically accurate the presentation of this story actually is. I would really like to know how they could reference the tensions that exist between different characters and the presentation of different figures. Are they real or imagined for narrative purpose?I get the feeling that the writers wanted to express the dichotomy of Van Gogh - the gentle, perceptive, altruistic man, and also the fiery, troubled, confrontational, argumentative soul. So do they project these perceptions upon their characters - or are these positions anchored in truth?The movement of the film is actually quite slow. I would say that someone who didn't have a specific love of Van Gogh might consider it to be slow and uneventful.Of course the outcome is inevitable and tragic - so the air of melancholy hangs over the whole presentation. It would have been more of an achievement to actually present the joy that must have been present (at least at times) in the soul of this great genius. This doesn't come across because the film is saturated in sorrow.The dialogue is basic and doesn't ever challenge the actors - but the presentation is fine, and at times very good (Chris O'Dowd is my outstanding actor in this film).Bottom line is that this film is saved by the unique presentation - had it been a 'straight forward' film acted in a standard format, it wouldn't have got made, it would be too bland. It would be somewhere between documentary and biography and a little bit dry at that (not for cinema anyway).As it happens, I'm a huge admirer of Van Gogh and I have taken enough interest in him to watch several documentaries and to read a number of accounts of his life. For me this was well worth the wait - and if you're in the same boat you will enjoy it too. If you're not that interested in Van Gogh as an individual you might not get the same kick out of it. It is definitely for a very particular audience.",

The film is worth seeing, and will be forever remembered, for these visuals by themselves. Its only stumble comes from a script that has difficulty in reaching its conclusion, and the use of formulated black-and-white flashbacks to show Vincent's life leave something to be desired (especially when considering the film's other creative achievements.)

The story is maybe not the star of the show, or the reason this movie gets hyped, but that does not make it anything less than brilliant, it is a very well told story, it was very moving and emotional. I literally heard some of the crowd in the theater sobbing by the end of it.\nI absolutely loved the voice acting.

Directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman distinguish themselves by making this a Painted animated feature. Employing over 100 artists who undertook the daunting task of creating 65,000 painted frames (much of it painted over conventionally filmed scenes with actors).It certainly is a visual delight. Of course, there is a frisson in the room whenever a frame depicts one of the master's paintings. But, this isn't just a stunt picture. There is a lot of passion for Van Gogh and his work on display. The frame of the story takes place a year after Van Gogh's death with a man, Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth), seeking to find out the circumstances of his death. The flashbacks are shown in Black & White and are less overtly 'painted' than the present day fully painted sections. The most famous of the actors is Saorise Ronan as Dr. Gachet's daughter Marguerite. Most of the characters are directly from Van Gogh's work and letters, while others are 'inspired' by them. As visually appealing as LOVING VINCENT is, it's more than a bit unfortunate that the investigation angle comes off as a bit trite at times, and the dialogue is often flat when not downright unconvincing.Still, this is a unique picture that is worthy of a look by anybody interested in Van Gogh and the art of filmed animation.

It is filled with feeling, emotion; however, the way it impresses us is not like something called \"affective fallacy\", it may not remind us anything with its plot, it may not affect us with its story, its pure influence is about the art itself reminding the short story of O. Henry, \"The Last Leaf\". Art creates impressions making us appreciate, cry, and smile.Even if I do not want to analyze the movie, some details can be referred to remind us about the movie. With paintings on the cinema screen, without realities of our senses, this movie absolutely feels alive. Characters' movements, reflections, expressions on faces, leaves moving with the effect of wind, every camera movements possible -tracking shot, zooming, panning etc.- are reflected with great paintings in the style of Van Gogh. Their composition is something that the audience can easily get used to, even with a feeling suggesting us it is something more than reality, it is something alive, for instance, the scenes reflecting the stillness of the night or the light and shadow usage. Anyone can appreciate the efforts behind every scene. One of the most important problems about the movie is the expectation created by the movie from the beginning as it is so fascinating and impressive that the rest cannot follow it up with an average plot. A different directing style may have had the power to measure up to the effect of the movie's visuality, but undoubtedly it is worth seeing at the cinema.",

The way smoke and reflections are frequently incorporated into this movie is also very impressive. Shout out to the 100 artists that painstakingly worked on this film. Story - This is basically a type of murder-mystery surrounding Vincent's death. It isn't the most compelling murder mystery I've ever seen, but it is interesting to learn about this artist's death. Characters - Some of these characters aren't super well developed, but everyone in the movie is well presented and believable with some great voice acting. Yes, this takes place in France, and everyone has a British accent, but that doesn't really matter. Overall, this movie was pretty good, and it worth watching just for the art alone.",

            "content": "This is a film that will go down as a classic like \"Penny Serenade\" or \"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a day.\" We all think we know Vincent Van Gogh; like Beethoven and his Fifth Symphony, he has an impact on the collective psyche of humanity. This film takes a simple premise, the need to deliver a letter, and attempts to trace the last moments of Vincent Van Gogh, this taking place in 1891--a year after Vincent's suicide The directors took his paintings, including his portraiture, and morphed a story line with animation moving through a time-line of Vincent's last days.The story is told through Armand Roulin, son of Postman Roulin, who is expected to deliver the letter and on his way he attempts to learn from eyewitness of Vincent's last days. (Think Thorton Wilder's \"Bridge of San Luis Rey\".) He talks to these various people.And here is one of the not so small caveats. Vincent committed suicide on 29 July, 1890; he painted the portrait of Adeline Ravoux in June of 1890 when she was 12 years old; she can be recognized in the film from the 1890 portrait. Given that many 12 year old in 1890 would have a certain maturity, still the Adeline Ravoux depicted on film is clearly a grown up, not a 13 year old child, which is what she would be in 1891. She appears int the film as tall as Armand, which would be unusual for a 12/13 year old, even allowing for growth spurts. While we recognize many of Vincent's paintings, they do morph so one is lost on where the painting ends and the morphing begins. What part is a Vincent, and what part is morph? No small or irrelevant question there. We are forced to return to the books of his painting to help us discern the difference. Like that is a bad thing? As the movie progresses, the old man, posits a theory of murder not suicide as the cause of death. Armand, citing from a letter written a few weeks before Vincent's suicide, asks the question of how a person goes from being calm and six weeks later committing suicide. Of course, in 1890, the notion of bi-polar, manic-depression would have been unknown; something the modern mind is all too familiar with. So Armand wonders about the feasibility of murder as an alternative to suicide. By the end of the film, Dr. Paul Gachet, who treated Vincent and also recognizable from Vincent's portraiture, offers an explanation that Armand seemingly accepts.The story that unfolds about Vincent Van Gogh is a very human story; while there are serious caveats, it is still an excellent film and will be established as a classic. Vincent only painted for eight years, starting at age 28; in that 8 year period he created 800 works, of which only one was sold. Presumably, letters make up the back story that unfolds in the film; though that would include another level of scholarship.",

It's very effective in evoking van Gogh's art. It's an amazing achievement and artistic triumph. The story suffers from one main drawback. This is a van Gogh biopict but it's told through other people's points of view. There is the standard questioning of the unreliable storytellers. There is also a lack of stakes. It's not like anybody is getting arrested for Vincent's murder by the postman's son. On top of that, the recall of these witnesses leads to black and white flashbacks. This robs the movie of van Gogh's need for intense colors. It robs the audience of Vincent. The movie would probably work better as a straight forward film of his last days from Vincent's point of view. It would be a better character study of Vincent who is the only person anybody cares about in this movie.",

            "content": "Vincent Van Gogh was a fine artist with a distinctive visual style. His personal life was also an interesting one and lends itself well to film.'Loving Vincent' was an interesting film. It is an uneven and flawed film but it is also very beautiful, thoughtful and emotional, as well as having one of the most innovative visual styles of any film personally seen. It is very easy to see why a lot will like, and even love (like many have done here), 'Loving Vincent'. Can also see why others may be frustrated by it, despite the visuals and emotional impact it is wanting biographically and while it didn't bother me at all the slow pace may test people.Would have liked for 'Loving Vincent' to have focused more on his life, which is substantial and intriguing enough to fill a film, and less on the interesting and thought-provoking but fairly speculative and controversial conspiracy theories with artistic license that will frustrate purists and historians.Most of the script is fine but runs out of steam a little too early, which makes the conclusion not quite as satisfying as it could have been (no matter how tear-jerking one feels after the film is over). Some of the rotoscopic technique doesn't quite gel.On the other hand, 'Loving Vincent' is mostly visually stunning and stylistically it stands out in a unique way. The oil painting animation is so rich in detail and a feast for the eyes that it's enough to make the jaw drop, the distinctive psychological rawness of the painting style captivating. The black and white flashbacks are almost classic film film-noir-like, and are not just beautifully shot in their own way but they are handled and meshed very neatly. The music score is both haunting and soothing.The script is mostly thought-provoking and intelligent, never stilted or rambling. The story is deliberate but the melancholic tone is genuinely poignant and offers a lot of insight, even if it could have been more focused. The characters intrigue and carry the story well and they are well performed, even by Douglas Booth who tends to leave me indifferent.In short, really liked 'Loving Vincent' but it fell a little short of me loving it. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

The premise in this movie is maybe he didn't, maybe someone else shot him and he just didn't want to expose the culprit. So the postman's son is given an undelivered letter, he looks for Theo but finds that he too has died. So in the time he was in France the postman's son does a bit of detective work, seeking to find the truth.

It is based entirely on his paintings and is actually like a cartoon film made of his paintings, while the characters, who are all genuine and existed in reality, are impersonated by actors by their voices, and it is expertly done - couldn't have been done better.The chief character is the son of Vincent's postman, who is entrusted with the task of delivering Vincent's last letter to his brother, whom Armand Roulin, the postman's son, doesn't know is already dead. He interviews people who were in touch with Vincent and who he lived with, ending up with doctor Gachet, who provides the final solution to the mystery. I don't think there has been made a film like this before with the ambition to explain the whole situation, but here it is done thoroughly convincingly. No question marks remain as the full tragedy appears in all its pathetic regrettability and loss, unnecessarily, of a great genius.The solution to the mystery will not be revealed here, but it appears quite clearly and rather soon that van Gogh impossibly could have shot himself in the belly. Someone else must have fired the shot, but who and why? That is the mystery. Or was it just an accident, but how could then such an accident be explained? There have been various other van Gogh films made before, and the best is probably still the Kirk Douglas version based on Irving Stone's famous novel, while other films have fallen flat. This is probably the version that comes closest to \"the true story\", although, naturally, Vincent's character appears slightly romanticized and brushed up.",

JIM'S REVIEW: Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman's love affair with the work of Vincent Van Gogh are on display in their full length animated homage, Loving Vincent. This tribute to one of the most lauded (posthumously) and greatest artist of all time tells the tragic death of the painter by making his Impressionist artwork that come to life. The filmmakers gathered a team of talented craftspeople together to film live action actors to tell the story and then meticulously paint over the actual actors in Van Gogh's signature painting style. The results are truly astonishing, even if the story becomes problematic (as with most animated films of late). The brushstrokes are frequent and fluid as they transition from scene to scenes, glorious golds swirl seamlessly with royal blues, and the effect is state-of-the-art animation that, well, impresses. Realistically rendered black and white flashback sequences contrast with more colorful scenes that come directly from Van Gogh's paintings and serve as a backdrop to the plot. But take away the stunning visual look of the film and the story doesn't hold up.The story focuses on Van Gogh's final days and becomes a whodunit of sorts, a conspiracy theory for art lovers everywhere. Did Vincent really commit suicide or was it murder? Paging Hercule Poirot!One wishes the screenplay would have spent more time focusing on the life of the artist rather than his semi-mysterious death. The narrative opportunities remain confused and simplistic. It's all talk, dull talk at that, with little action. The lines (or strokes) blur the truth with fiction and creates a false sense of reality. Were more time spent on a far-fetch theory that served as the film's major story-line, this film would be perfection. Instead we will settle for a gorgeously animated movie with much to see and little to say except conjecture.Yet there is much to admire in their creative vision. The filmmaker's own work of passion is evident in every frame of this film. The fact that it took ten years to complete this project shows the earnestness and dedication of all the artisans involved. Visually arresting but story-wise far-fetched, Loving Vincent just gives off the wrong Impression, no matter how lovely it is to behold.",

            "content": "When I visited the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam I was unaware of the amount of letters Vincent wrote to his brother, Theo. Throughout the museum were snippets of his letters in both written and audio form. As I read or listened to each one in the midst of some of the best artwork ever created, I became extremely moved by what they revealed about history's most prolific painter. What I learnt was that Vincent was a man who felt deeply; he loved deeply, worried deeply, thought deeply, perhaps a little too much for the mind to bare. \nThis film showcases this conflict and I think it does so beautifully and more importantly, respectfully. The artistry achievement alone is astonishing and I don't think I want to watch any other film about Van Gogh if I can't see it through his eyes like you do in Loving Vincent. Not only is this effect innovative & unique, but it heightens the tones of mystery, nostalgia and grief to an exceptionally moving level. \nThe morality of the story is overwhelming. Van Gogh was a severely misunderstood pioneer of the creative imagination, an attribute not commonly appreciated by small communities in that context. The success of this often gloomy narrative is due to the evolving mindset of our protagonist played by Douglas Booth. Not only does he eventually come to understand that Van Gogh was a natural at his craft, his character is one that changes from start to end aas he becomes to realize the tragic yet kind person Van Gogh really was. We as an audience are discovering all this with Booth and so by the end, we too are irrevocably moved and inspired by the ever Loving, Vincent.",

The screenplay of 'Loving Vincent' invents the clever device of sending a young man called Armand to deliver a mislaid letter from the deceased artist to his brother Theo. When Armand discovers Theo has also died, his attempts at postal delivery mutate into a private eye investigation focused on the mysterious circumstances surrounding Vincent's death from a gunshot wound.Armand's inquiries reveal a sympathetic side to the troubled artist, and they move into mildly suspenseful territory as Vincent's former associates contradict each other over details of his last hours. Unfortunately, the film throws away most of this potential by using a gimmicky pseudo-Impressionist animation technique. The distracting mimicry of Van Gogh's painting style undermines the narrative's serious turn, since the images can't convey a character's nuanced expressions to the same extent as an actor. In the end Armand's fishing expedition doesn't net any big catches - and it soon becomes tiresome watching a conveyor belt of third-rate Van Gogh imitations being produced at 12 frames per second.",

            "content": "Last week, at the beautiful Getty Center, we had the chance to view a pre-screening of the movie, 'Loving Vincent,' world's first full-feature film made entirely with oil paintings. Loving Vincent revolves around the mysterious death of the artist Vincent Van Gogh who had created around 800 paintings in his lifetime. What could have been much easily created as an animated or live action feature, ended up being a compilation of over 66000 frames of oil paintings, brought to life with camera movements on still life, CG animation, daunting music and of course skills of over 100 artists. The concept of the movie is a good enough reason to watch this movie but as for the movie itself: read the review ahead!The movie follows the journey of Armand Roulin as he investigates the mysterious death of the artist Van Gogh. The movie retains an air of suspicion and depression throughout. The pace of the storyline is slow as it attempts to combine several theories regarding Van Gogh's death. Yet the village panoramas and aerial shots of Paris add life to the story. As the camera sweeps across the field or up a river as a steam engine pass through the bridge above, one cannot help but notice how beautifully the steam is blending in with the sky. The dialogues have been largely inspired by the letters that Van Gogh wrote to his brothers but lack speech authenticity from the period. However, the dialogues do exhibit the positions of all the characters thoroughly, especially those of Armand Roulin and if not an instant connection with the character, one does eventually the pain and sorrows of Van Gogh towards his end days.The death of Van Gogh was a loss to the world of art but the movie 'Loving Vincent' is a big leap in the world of art and fulfilling the void of the amazing artist, and others like him who suffered because they weren't mentally healthy.",

As a movie, it doesn't entirely work, though I give it credit for being bold. It illustrates the events leading up to van Gogh's death, told like a murder mystery through the point of view of a man connected to his family and wanting to return something to the family that belonged to Vincent. Throughout the film, he runs into people who knew van Gogh for one reason or another, and each one fills in another little bit of the story. This format gets monotonous quickly, and the mystery aspect feels like it's been imposed where it doesn't belong. I appreciated the resistance to making this a straight up biopic, because how boring. But the alternative the filmmakers land on doesn't really work.Still, those paintings though.Grade: B",

Certainly, much of the progress in the last quarter of century came from computer graphics and its derivatives, as the resolution and flexibility of the digital tools push the edge of innovation as far as the fantasy of the creators with it. Yet, there is room for novelty even by using more conventional means, and they can be up to the task of creating artistic emotion. 'Loving Vincent' created by Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman is the best proof .This is kind of post-biographical story and if you want also a possible crime investigation, as the story focuses on the last weeks of the life of Vincent van Gogh revealed through the eyes of the son of The Postman (one of the famous paintings of Vincent) who comes to the place of his death a couple of years later to deliver a last letter of the artist. By now almost everybody is familiar with the tragic destiny of the painter and there are no big news in the story, despite an apparent and not very convincing tentative of questioning the circumstances of van Gogh's death. The interest of the film and its magnetic attraction lie someplace else.The film in my opinion never intended to be a true detective story. It is actually the animation technique which transforms 'Loving Vincent' into a memorable visual experience. The way the story is being told starts from the paintings, portraits and landscapes painted by van Gogh during his stays in Paris and Arles. We know many of them, but we have not seen them this way, as the paintings get life and turn into a manner of reflecting the world and the period the painter lived in through his eyes. The technique used is building each fragment frame by frame with the painters means, and the result is amazing. Each one of the frames is a work of art by itself, and the overall atmosphere is overwhelming. The film is about Vincent, about the people that surrounded him and the world he lived in. The magic lies not that much in the story but in the way it is being told. 'Loving Vincent' is a true work of art and a declaration of love for the artist who signed Vincent.",

            "content": "There have been many attempts over the years to comprehend the genius of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, from 1956's Lust for Life, to 1990's ambitious Vincent & Theo. While some of these movies are unquestionably good - perhaps none more masterful than Maurice Pialat's Van Gogh - the man himself remains an enigma, so filmmakers have now been forced to take more experimental measures when attempting to understand the painter who, while now regarded as one of art's most influential figures, only managed to sell one painting out of a rumoured 900 during his lifetime. Much focus is placed on the infamous ear-slicing incident, and this is where we began in Loving Vincent, a joint Polish and UK film that employed 125 painters to painstakingly recreate van Gogh's style over footage shot with actors in front of a green screen.A year after van Gogh's suicide, postmaster and close friend of the troubled artist Joseph Roulin (Chris O'Dowd) tasks his street-fighting son Armand (Douglas Booth) with delivering van Gogh's final letter to his brother Theo. With questions surrounding the suicide still up in the air, Joseph finds van Gogh's sudden demise as suspicious, especially since the painter was in high spirits in the days leading up to the tragedy. It's a feeling that will eventually be shared by Joseph as he embarks on his journey, meeting faces familiar to us from van Gogh's portraits, including the likes of art dealer Pere Tanguy (John Sessions), cafe owner Adeline Ravoux (Eleanor Tomlinson) and close friend Doctor Gachet (Jerome Flynn). As Joseph learns of van Gogh's day-to-day life and his rocky relationship with Gachet and his daughter Marguerite (Saoirse Ronan), this may not be a cut-and-dry suicide carried out by an ear-chopping madman as previously thought.By turning the subject of van Gogh into a dime-store detective story, Loving Vincent frequently runs the risk of tipping over into TV movie territory. What ultimately prevents this from happening is the time, care and love etched into every frame by directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman and the tireless artists, who took approximately 6 years to recreate the likes of Starry Night, At Eternity's Gate and Bank of the Oise at Auvers, and weave these scenes into a convincing narrative. There's also great work by the ensemble cast, each bringing to life the portraits they're based on without feeling staged, and each character offering a unique viewpoint of van Gogh himself, and how he was treated by those around him. It's a fresh take on van Gogh's life, mixing traditional narrative with flashbacks and interpretations in the hope of understanding this mysterious figure or seeing him from a different angle. The man himself is here also, played by Robert Gulaczyk, but his actions and behaviours still remain a mystery. While the true crime slant is somewhat pulpy, Loving Vincent is a treat for fans of van Gogh's work, and undeniably crafted with tenderness and a genuine love of its subject.",

            "content": "\"Loving Vincent\" is a new Polish-British movie in the English-language that runs for a bit over 1.5 hours and was written and directed by Dorota Kobiela and Oscar winner Hugh Welchman. The cast of voice actors includes many known names, especially Saoirse Ronan I guess, a recent Oscar nominee and she may have a chance to get in this year too. As for this film here, it certainly does as well. Solid recognition from the Annies and a Golden Globe nomination make this a potential Oscar nominee with maybe even a dark horse shot at the win. It's probably everybody against Coco at this point. The film plays briefly after the death of painter Vincent van Gogh as we follow a future policeman's investigation into the death of Vincent. And the longer his research continues, the more personal it becomes for him. He meets several people who played a more or less crucial role in Vincent's life, friends, (potential) lovers, but also some you may consider foes. Will he be able to deliver the letter? That one gets solved really quickly through history. The heart and soul of the film is the animation and this aspect is also what everything is about in how well you will like this movie. For me it was sadly a negative deal breaker, perhaps because I am not really that big on actual paintings. You could call it a motion painting for sure and this is also what brought up all these superlatives and the awards attention it got I'm sure. Yes the effort is massive here, but is that really enough to make it a convincing movie. Not for me, especially as the animation style made my eyes hurt quite a bit, the new sequences, not the b&w flashbacks. However, with these I must say I was wondering why the faces were so much clearer there. It cannot just be the clear memories. I swear this was Ronan's actual face, not the animated equivalent. These flashback sequences make sure there is enough of scenes with the actual van Gogh in here as he was still alive at that point. The best thing, maybe the only really good thing was were the closing credits. The singer here certainly wasn't on par with Don McLean, but the song is just so amazing and miraculous that it is impossible to not feel anything while listening to it. And the images sure go well along too with what we hear. Shame though you have to sit through 90 minutes to get to that point, 90 minutes that are genuinely mediocre for the most part with characters and a story that rarely make a difference. I wonder if they held him back character-wise to not take away any focus from van Gogh? But then why turn him into a truly significant character near the end again saying how this letter is all about his journey from now on. Does that mean it was all consideren pointless before? Anyway, I was pretty surprised that the film actually got our theatre almost full to the last seat. Did not expect audiences to show such an interest in it. Of course, this may be an animated movie, but style and story never make it one for kids. They won't understand it and they'll be quickly bored perhaps. Finally, even if I give this film a thumbs-down and a negative recommendation and don't understand the great amount of praise and awards recognition, let me end this review on a positive note by saying I really enjoyed the ways in which they included many of van Gogh's paintings here. Still I suggest you watch something else instead.",

            "content": "Beginning from the credits, rolling in front of a beautifully animated Starry Night, this film was- first and foremost- a work of art. There is a story, yes. A very educational mystery, in fact, that held me in suspense. I was aware of how Van Gogh supposedly died, but never the puzzling details surrounding his supposed suicide in 1890. What really happened to him? Did he commit suicide? He seemed to be doing fine. How was his doctor involved? His brother? The doctor's daughter who is as beautiful as she is evasive with answering questions surrounding the relationship with the painter? Van Gogh chops off his ear, gifts it to a prostitute, then shows up at the hotel he is staying at, shot in the stomach. He claims he tried to commit suicide, but is this the truth? Could he be protecting someone instead? He was a shy, rough man in his early thirties that had no formal training, but had somehow made it. A genius of an artist that was at the height of his career, there was little reason for his suicide. He had some mental health problems but had been feeling better. He had a somewhat unprofessionally friendly relationship with his doctor whom he visited at his home. There might have been financial problems, as evidenced by his correspondence with his brother Theo. The script is based on these real-life letters. In the summer of 1891, shortly after Vincent Van Gough's death, the protagonist Armand Roulin is given a letter by his father, the local postman. The keep was written by the artist, addressed to his brother. Armand has been given instructions to delivery this letter by hand. He soon finds out that its intended recipient had also recently died. But this is not a film you watch for the story. The paintings come alive, one brush stroke at a time; paintings I recognize from the little exposure I have had to the artist. As a small example, I would feel like I was looking at a gorgeous painting when suddenly the rain would begin to move, smoke would move from a pipe. Every scene with a light was animated to look like the stars in Starry Night, i.e. nightlights would have the curls around it. How awesome is that? 65,000 frames, hand-painted by hundreds of individual hands. This was a work of love, a work from the heart. You can no doubt see this as you watch the film unfold, a tribute to a genius. Be sure to watch the credits, which compare the original Vincent Van Gogh paintings with the actors and animated versions. Depending on the voice actors, characters can really be completely different. I felt the choices for the voice actors in this film were excellent. They made the animation come alive. They all used French pronunciations, making it very believable. Loved the monochrome scenes, all flashbacks. A perfect artistic choice, considering there were obviously no paintings to document these earlier years. As for the title, Van Gough often signed his letters, \"Your loving Vincent\". Aside from the play on words, that is. According to a press release, \"Loving Vincent\" was first shot as a live action film with actors who worked on sets specially constructed to look like Van Gogh paintings, or against green- screens. Then this reference footage was used to hand-paint the film frame-by-frame in oils. The final effect is an interaction of the performance of the actors playing Vincent's famous portraits, and the performance of the painting animators, bringing these characters into the medium of paint. A well-told narrative that felt like an animated, artistic documentary. For more on this magnificent treat for the eyes, I found myself losing a few hours here: http://lovingvincent.com So what do we have here? 125 painters, 180 hours required training each, 10 days per 1 second of film, 65,000 frames, 6500 tubes + 1300 liters of Royal Talens paint, 7 years, 1 extraordinary film.",

Armand visits P\u00e8re Tanguy (John Sessions), who informs him that Theo suffered became depressed, suffered from syphilis, deteriorated and died shortly after his brother's death, Tanguy recalls Van Gogh's eventual pursuit of art after several career path failures. Tanguy describes Van Gogh's funeral, and mentions Doctor Gachet (Jerome Flynn), who housed Van Gogh after his release from an asylum, he shared his love for art, he treated Van Gogh as family and was visibly distraught at the funeral. Armand travels to Auvers-sur- Oise, Dr. Gachet is out on business, his housekeeper Louise Chevalier (Helen McCrory) expresses contempt for Van Gogh, Armand waits for the doctor's return and decides to stay at the local inn Van Gogh had during his time in the area. There he meets temporary proprietress Adeline Ravoux (Eleanor Tomlinson), she had been present during Van Gogh's apparent suicide attempt and eventual death, she describes him as a quiet and eccentric man who loved his art and his children. Like Armand's father, she admits to being surprised at his suicide, as he had seemed in good spirits and had ordered more paint to continue his art. Armand follows Adeline's suggestion to visit the local Boatman (Aidan Turner), who informs him that Van Gogh was in close to Dr. Gachet's daughter Marguerite (Saoirse Ronan). Armand meets Marguerite, she claims she did not have a close relationship with Van Gogh, he suggests Van Gogh's suicidal mood was brought on following an argument with her father, who forbade her from seeing him, she rejects this. Armand continues to investigate Van Gogh's death, he questions why he returned to the inn and shot himself in the stomach rather than in the head, he finds out later that he was shot in a different location than the one reported. Van Gogh was in the company of some local boys, including Rene Secretan (Marcin Sosinski), who often drunkenly waved a gun around town. Armand visits the boatman again, he is informs him that Rene enjoyed tormenting and humiliating Van Gogh, Armand also visits Doctor Mazery (Bill Thomas), who examined Van Gogh, he tells that the shot that killed Van Gogh came from a distance, suicide was ruled impossible. Meeting with Marguerite again, she admits to Armand she was indeed close to the artist, but not romantically, and the argument between him and her father was not about her. Armand theorises to Marguerite that a drunken Rene accidentally shot Van Gogh, she says that no matter what happened, Van Gogh was still dead and his life mattered more than the circumstances of his death. Dr. Gachet finally returns and promises to deliver Armand's letter to Theo's widow, the doctor says that depressed patients' moods can vary wildly, he could easily have gone calm to suicidal in six weeks. The guilt-ridden Gachet admits to being envious of Van Gogh's talent and commitment to art, the argument was due to Van Gogh calling him cowardly for not pursuing his passion, the enraged Gachet accused the artist of making Theo's health worse due to a profitless pursuit of art, he theorises Van Gogh was driven to suicide to release Theo from the burden. In the end, Armand returns home, his father received word from Theo's widow, Johanna, thanking Armand for returning the letter - signed, \"Your loving Vincent.\" The end credits reveal that Armand joined the army, Adeline married a local innkeeper, Marguerite remained unmarried and kept Van Gogh's painting of her for over 40 years, and Rene Secretan admitted on his deathbed to tormenting Van Gogh, but claimed Van Gogh stole his gun. It also says that Vincent Van Gogh painted over 800 paintings in just 8 years, none of which sold to the public, though he would go on to be named by art historians as the father of modern painting. Also starring Richard Banks as Ravoux Regular and Shaun Newnham as Landlord of The Night Cafe. The cast all do their parts fine, and the story is mildly interesting, looking into the last days of the artist who only became famous after his death, but let's be honest, it's the animation that is really the best thing about this film, the colourful wash of colour to bring the characters and scenery to life is impeccable, including clever black and white flashback scenes, \"the world's first fully painted feature film\" is a most watchable animated drama. It was nomimated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Good!",

            "content": "Cinema has always been a gloried artwork and we have much more authentic proof in astounding Loving Vincent.An animated construction entirely brought to life by oil paintings, is quintessential proof that cinema has still barely scratched the surface of its reaches. Loving Vincent is landmark event for animation and even biographical storytelling through its majestic vision at the last days of Vincent Van Gogh.Set a after the death of fabled painter, Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) is possessed with a letter from Van Gogh to his brother Theo before his death, and begins the journey to deliver it. While on call, Roulin encounters all the people close to Vincent before is death gradually trying to put the pieces of what cause his sudden suicide. From this we are taken back to key moments of Van Gogh's life mesmerizingly displayed through the living oil paintings.Generated by 65,000 paintings by over a 100 artist, Loving Vincent is living work of art. First shot as a live action depiction then adapted into paintings, the immersive gallery of scenes is a first in new format of animation. Directors: Dorota Kobiela, and Hugh Welchman take Van Gogh's own artistry into his own biography (almost), from Citizen Kane style narrative, assessing and celebrating the life of one of the worlds if not the most famous painter. From this production becomes transporting cinema experience into the world of Van Gogh and an enchanting watch of magnificent painting and animation.Of course what is the fundamental strength of Loving Vincent is its captivating artwork which for every moment is spectacular, and then you have the real narrative of Van Gogh's last days which on its own is an affectionate journey. Even if you don't not much about the life of Van Gogh this is an enthralling experience.The monumental presence of the paintings is consistently exceptional with wonderful detail and creation put into it. One of the sensational efforts for the film is its sketch of the real actors, making them instantly recognisable on screen, bringing their performance into the art. Although our eyes are set on visual presence, Clint Mansell's score is also a tear-jerking atmosphere throughout the film, capturing the melancholy as well as joy of Van Gogh.Loving Vincent is a visual sensation, proving the amazing talent that animation brings to the screen. This is by far one of the most significant films of the year and is must see experience, especially for art students.",

It's difficult to review movies like this as there really weren't many flaws to speak of, other than there being a few of the longer and landscape shots where the artwork feels a bit too crude to make out too well.As far as the character art and close-ups, the film really shines, managing to incorporate most of Van Gogh's most famous pieces into the narrative. Not only will this movie appeal to fans of the man's art, but likely will create a new generation of fans by making it all more accessible and adding an emotionally resonant backstory to what otherwise would be viewed as just nice looking portraits of random people.I couldn't help but feel a lot of comparison to some other rotoscoped films like SCANNER DARKLY and WAKING LIFE, especially with the otherworldly tone granted to the film by the visual style. To my eye, it's far better looking than WAKING LIFE and has a much more compelling narrative, even if it really boils down to a similar series of interviews. Hats off to all of those involved for the many painstaking years of combined work to put this together. It's a shame that films like this don't find a larger audience but a minor miracle that they manage to get made considering the economics of the industry these days.",

Blatant exposition is delivered in almost every single scene, and none of the characters are developed in the slightest bit, and therefore there's no reason to care about them or the story that they are involved in.

            "content": "A late artist, who only devoted himself to painting in the last eight years of his life, although he worked as an art dealer years earlier with his brother Theo. Vicent painted over 850 paintings, but while alive he had only one purchased. He died poor, supported by his brother. He was a creative and prolific artist as few, lived and left life miserable as many.\nThe plot of the story in \"Loving Vicent\" describes Armand - son of Van Gogh's friend postman Roulin - trying to locate Theo to deliver him a letter that Vincent recounted just before he died. By the way, this is a fact that should be better explored in the animated feature, the two brothers exchanged many correspondences during these eight years in which the painter lived in France, especially in Arles and Saint-R\u00e9my.\nThe animation is entirely made up of oil paintings, based on techniques developed by Van Gogh and inspired by his paintings. A novella documentary, Loving Vicent (original title in English) is a work as exciting and inspiring as the works of the genius about which it narrates. There are 65,000 frames, produced by 100 painters! A great production for a great story. Named for the best animated Oscar in 2018, the film has already garnered nearly 50 nominations and 20 awards. Shame on you, Academy, for not having awarded the film. For those who like to admire beautiful paintings, being thus a fan of the painter who most influenced such art in the twentieth century, production is unmissable, and impossible to watch it just once.\nHis last two months of life, probably the most productive, were lived in Auvers sur Oise. Among the paintings he produced in this city located 30 km away from Paris are \"Portrait of Dr Gachet (first version), oil on canvas, 67 x 56 cm, June, 1890\", \"Sheaves of Wheat, oil on canvas, 50.5 x 101.0 cm, July, 1890\" and \"Landscape at Twilight, oil on canvas, 50.2 cm x 101 cm, June 1890\". Beautiful demonstrations of his level of inspiration and creation in the period.\nThe central point of the film is the treatment given to Vincent's emotional issues and his great artistic restlessness. Here we are presented with the view that he was not mentally disturbed, but emotionally unstable and extremely intense. The direction, the production and the writers deserve our congratulations by so deep sensitivity.\nA life without recognition, without success, without prominence and full of difficulties. Many human beings would wish not go on living, as Vincent Van Gogh has decided to do so. Still, I prefer to keep the image of the determined painter, who did not give in. Someone who, whenever he felt defeated, repeated to himself: Continue, continue, that is what is needed.",

It is the first thing you notice when you watch it, before the movie begins text pops up and proudly declares their accomplishment. And, dang, this film is a sight to behold. The love and care that went into crafting this specific art style for this film is incredible. Any given freeze frame of this movie could be hung up at a museum and fit right in. Doing one of these paintings takes so much time and skill, let alone doing enough to make 1hr 35 minutes of 60 frames per second. Each painting patterned off of Van Gough's style. And it isn't just one art style. As the film goes to flashbacks, or establishing shots, they are different beautiful Van Gough styles. And the transitions this film can do! They fully take advantage of the painting aesthetic to transition from one art style to the next. As a love letter to Vincent Van Gough, this film is 10/10. They incorporate his art style, the characters from his paintings and the facts about his life. Perfect for any art class. Oh, and the end credit song...perfect.I just wish the story was as beautiful as the visuals. As a movie, the story is still OK, and the characters likewise are fine. It plays out like it is 45-minute TV crime drama. The main character goes from person to person to interrogate them about what they knew about Vincent. He's not a detective, it just plays out in a similar police style investigation. He is just going forward in his investigation more out of curiosity than out of duty. Without a clear motive from our main character and no definitive goal, the movie feels like it drags. For such a short movie, I shouldn't be getting bored, but the story does become pretty repetitive after returning to the same locations and hearing just a little more about the same event.I recommend it more off of its visuals than I do off of the characters or story. But so it is in life, when you look this good, you really don't have to worry about character.",

            "content": "Loving Vincent was an indie film the never really got a lot of attention, despite being a groundbreaking film on a technical scale. This was the first movie ever to ever be made entirely of paintings, in this case all done in the distinctive and famous style of Vincent Van Gogh. The film consists of an incredible 65,000 individual painted frames. It got nominated for a Golden Globe and an Oscar, although lost both times to Coco. The amount of work put into this movie is truly remarkable, and it's a truly unique film. There really is nothing like it in terms of production. That alone makes it worth watching.It tells the story from the perspective of Armand Roulin, the son of Joseph (as in Van Gogh's Portrait of the Postman), who travels to Auvers after hearing the news of Van Gogh's death by suicide. He talks to various townspeople to hear their perspective on Vincent as a person, and their impressions (no pun intended) of him. The audience is given several different opinions on Vincent, including those who loved him, and those who thought he was insane and that his unsuccessful art career was a burden. It is told partially in flashbacks, which is the only time Van Gogh himself appears. There's also a sub-plot involving the doctor who thinks he was murdered, and it kind of turns into a watered-down Amadeus for a little while, which really wasn't necessary. One of the best things about this movie was that Van Gogh paintings are used as backgrounds periodically throughout the movie, including The Church at Auvers, Caf\u00e9 Terrace at Night, and, of course, The Starry Night. Each one is very pleasant to see and acknowledge. Many of the characters are people whose portraits were done by Van Gogh. This is a movie I have a personal affection for. I am an art lover, and I do love Van Gogh's work. I'm fortunate enough to live close to numerous paintings by Van Gogh, so I have gotten much exposure to his work. More importantly, I myself have struggled with depression and mental illness, so it hits close to home on a few different levels. You can't explain when a movie does that to you. Some movies just resonate with certain people for different emotional reasons. Loving Vincent is a movie that does that to me. I'll openly admit to crying during this movie. It's just that powerful for me. Some of the scenes with Vincent and Dr. Gachet remind me of when my own depression hit its peak and I felt like a burden to everyone. The other scene that hit hard was at the end when Armand and Joseph Roulin were talking and Joseph talks about how hard the world can be for more creatively minded people while the sun sets and the Starry Night Over the Rhone rises. That reminded me of my academic troubles at the height of my depression. It's a very powerful thing; when you relate so well to a movie. It's even stronger when it gives you a person, including one you know of, that you find yourself relating very well to. One of the best things about cinema as an art form is how you see from the perspectives of other people. When it turns out to be someone who's a lot like you, it's a very special experience. Those are the movies that truly stick with you.",

            "content": "There's not a shred of me that doubts the talent and time put into every painstaking and undeniably beautiful frame of 'Loving Vincent (2017)', a passion-project which was perhaps unadvisedly painted by hand twenty-four times a second. Not just painted, but properly oil-painted in the style(s) of its somewhat eclectic and now incredibly famous eponymous artist in a move that may have been somewhat ill-advised, considering what the team hoped to achieve narratively, but is certainly impressive. It's the narrative and essentially everything not associated with the visuals that fall flat, though. The story, which is oddly structured and callously segmented, certainly is an incredibly weak attempt at telling an ultimately 'pointless', paint-by-numbers tale. The conceit is that characters and locations from Van Gogh's collection of work are brought to life and used to retell the events leading up to and in the aftermath of his death, with the former being told mostly through frequent flashbacks. The feature quickly becomes insanely repetitive, however, because every encounter our protagonist has always goes the same way: he meets someone, they tell him a tale about Van Gogh, a flashback or two plays, we're told of someone else who might have a better understanding of the artist and then our hero moves onto the next person. Rinse and repeat, over and over again. As you can imagine, this becomes very tiresome, very quickly. Especially when most of these encounters amount to the same thing 'revelation'-wise - and, indeed, in terms of expository information, despite the constant exposition - and don't add anything to the overall 'mystery', which isn't really portrayed as such and doesn't get a satisfactory conclusion - not even an appropriately 'unanswered' one. Speaking of the exposition, the sheer amount of it is almost unrivalled in recent cinema. Every line is burdened with it, on-the-nose and heavy-handed, which makes for a slog of a watch that tells even while it shows. The fact that there's not all that much to tell makes this all the more perplexing. Why they didn't show the story or frame the narrative in more visual fashion - even if it would need to be linear and remove the unnecessary 'post-man' framing device - really is beyond me, especially for a piece so concerned with the way it looks. Honestly, it is a bore and a real chore to get through. It talks down to you, tells you every little detail but never gives you anything meaty to work with, and ultimately doesn't even stick with the theory it presents probably because it is just that: a theory. It could've leaned further into its 'what-if' aspects or alternate-history investigation angle, but instead chose to try and blend its speculation with reality and ends on a strange half-and-half note that doesn't stick the landing. All could be forgiven if it was entertaining, even in the slightest, but it isn't, despite being somewhat intriguing in a few sequences. Like I said, this intrigue all but crumbles away and all you're left with is stilted dialogue, a ham-fisted screenplay, a poor narrative and some truly beautifully animation. One of those things doesn't belong with the rest. Yet, there it sits among the aspects that drag it down. It's a shame, too. All that hard work for something that doesn't stand up in the medium it is presented. If they wanted to make a film that is also a piece of art, they should've focused on the film aspects first because those elements are what can elevate a piece to 'art' status (though it could be argued that every movie can be classed as art, anyway). Film has never been about the visuals, not really. You don't hang a still of a flick up in an art gallery. It's about the piece in motion, the nuances of the story and its themes and, most importantly, how it makes you feel. Sadly, all this picture made me feel was bored. 5/10",

The dialogue is poor, and it comes across like a mix of an ITV Sunday afternoon detective programme and a montage of video game cutscenes.The animation itself in these segments is off-putting, as the level of detail given to the actors' rotoscoped faces is too high for you to feel like you are watching anything but filmed footage. The effect comes across as something that could have been more simply achieved by using a snapchat filter, and you can't help feel sorry for the animators who had to paint variations of the same face hundreds of times in order to deliver these dreary scenes. The point of animation and of art is to capture an essence of life, yet the much lauded approach taken in this film is devoid of soul and as such seems a massive waste of effort.When the film allows for a more imaginative use of the animated painting effect in it's few less presentational and more cerebral moments the whole thing manages to engage much more. These sections typically focus more on Vincent's actual life (which is surely what audiences are interested in, not in conspiracy theories surrounding his death) and are free of the monotonous talking segments. I can't help but feel this would have been a better focus for the film, and that the medium of animation could have been used to explore his psyche in an unusual and interesting manner rather than to deliver a rote story that tells us very little.",

The brother of Van Gogh has an endless gap of correspondence that the young Armand has been commissioned to fill. A simple delivery soon transpires into an entangling film noir melodrama.

Armand does not have any horses in the race beside his unquenchable thirst for truth.

The toil of over 100 artist and 853 establishing paintings leave an undeniable mark of care. Each frame speaks to the playful tinkering that brought still figures to live.A celebration of Van Gogh's tumultuous life, and an examination of his curious demise, the postmortem play chooses to remember the painter in unassuming vignettes and ordinary tasks. A man burdened by finances and plagued by aristocratic contemporaries, he weaved about a drab lifestyle with obsessive dedication to his craft.Van Gogh could turn the most ordinary into a fascinating exploration of form and expression. His rain-soaked canvases tell a tale of uncompromising devotion when the world punished legacy creators. His death marked the greatest \"what if\" in art history, a question that will spark a dangerous journey for Armand.",

Van Gogh's life and death has been documented but certain points revealed were new to me.

            "content": "What the world seems to want is a well-balanced, upstanding member of society that contributes in an inoffensive way to the majority as he or she creates mind-bending art of remarkable caliber. A prince of creativity, along with a saint who has no questionable personal tastes or occasional trips to the darker side of the intellect.It's a horrible shame that Vincent Van Gogh's achievements were only appreciated AFTER his demise. That during his lifetime he was regarded as a kind of leper, an outcast... somebody misunderstood and terribly feared, for some reason.So, in a jaw-dropping, unbelievable achievement of filmmaking the likes of which I never would have comprehended, much less imagined, we have LOVING VINCENT. Eight hundred and fifty three oil paintings create the animation we see here, and though I thought I had an idea of what I was getting into before I saw this...I was WRONG. Oh my lord I was wrong.With tears in my eyes and my jaw dropped to the floor for the first hour at least, the visual feast before my eyes is like nothing I have ever seen before in my life. The actors come to life, their caricatures made of a skin that was of Vincent's hand... as though we were watching a tale unfold through his eyes.Is this the most action-packed, thrilling piece of cinema you will ever see?Not by a long shot. In fact, there isn't much in the area of action anywhere to be found. I suppose to some, that may be a detriment. Surely, if you feel nothing when you look at a painting, you will most likely be bored to tears watching this film. If the painting has no meaning to you beyond a swath of paint swirls, and you cannot see the majesty, the difficulty, the scope of attempting to capture a moment in time that can both speak enough to the viewer to tell a story and at the same time show a glimpse of the world as the artist sees it, this film is not for you.So not everyone will see what I saw when Loving Vincent. Indeed, if you are unfamiliar with him or his works, this might fall flat on your radar. The plot is not truly its strongest part.The spectacle is. The ability to interweave Vincent's life through a world made of paintings that he himself painted, showing landscapes and buildings and people interacting in HIS VERSION of the world is simply indescribably beautiful to behold.Nobody pulls any punches here in terms of acting. You could simply call these voice-overs, but as you will be able to tell by the credits at the end, the actors went to a lot of trouble to BECOME the characters behind the oil, most likely in an effort to help out the more than one hundred painters who made LOVING VINCENT possible. Three that stand out, in my mind, would be Douglas Booth playing the itinerary protagonist, Armand Roulin. The stunningly charming and beautiful Eleanor Tomlinson playing Adeline Ravoux. And finally Jerome Flynn as Doctor Gachet (though that last one might be a bit of bias on my part - he impressed me deeply with his performance in GAME OF THRONES).I want to stress that NOBODY should be discredited here, from the characters who did not even get names to the postman with the extraordinary beard, to the children who only briefly interact with Armand through his exploration of Vincent's life (and death). Everyone has a purpose. Everyone adds to the beauty seen before our eyes.It has always brought me the worst sadness to think of Vincent and his life. Such a shame that everything he did managed to create lasting impressions down through the years, but only after his time of suffering and struggle on this earth ended. At the very least, this is a brilliant, heartfelt, loving tribute to the poor man and what he gave to the world, long after he went to the dust.",

There's no interesting dialogue, plot twists or performances. At no point is the surface of any of the characters really scratched or anything we don't know already added. Most of the actors really don't sound like they are giving more to their roles than a script-in-hand run-through, and Douglas Booth in the lead role is the weakest link. Chris O'Dowd aquits himself better than the rest.The story of Van Gogh has been put on film a number of times, most notably in Lust For Life, with Kirk Douglas in his greatest ever role, and I would most certainly recommend that film over this. But it IS mind-bendingly pretty, all the same, and brings Vincent's paintings to life in a way unimaginable before.",

            "content": "Loving Vincent (2017): 7 out of 10: An art film in more ways than one, Loving Vincent is the tale of a postmaster's son asked by his father to deliver a letter from Vincent Van Gogh to his brother Theo.Soon this simple task becomes a journey into finding out why Vincent van Gogh committed suicide or even if he did. What we end up with is a Rashomon style story where everyone in the small provincial village where Vincent died has a different and often conflicting story.The Good: Let's start with the six hundred pound oil painting in the room. Loving Vincent has a gimmick, and it is a doozy. Each frame (all 65,000 of them) are handpainted by a group of 120 painters. The actors are then animated and rotoscoped onto the oil paintings.Now I know rotoscoped is a scary word. We all remember Ralph Bakshi use of rotoscoping for his animated features Wizards (1977) and The Lord of the Rings (1978). Scary times indeed. Loving Vincent's technique, guided by a bigger budget and forty years of technology improvements, is spot on.The settings and many of the characters are right out of Vincent Van Gogh's paintings, and scenes often start with a classic Van Gogh painting and then has the action seamlessly move on from there. Whether in movies or even video games such gimmicks often lose their effect after viewing for a while. While I certainly got used to the technique in Loving Vincent, it never became unnoticeable.The Bad: Loving Vincent is a quiet tale that fails a task one can give biography. Would this story be interesting if it happened to someone not famous? The answer here is a solid no. The movie's story reminds one of a walking simulator video game rather than a film with our protagonist walking around chatting people up and then going into flashback cutscenes (Done in a different black and white sketch style like that Take on Me a-ha video). We get a decent picture of Vincent in his last days and the people around him, but the central mystery of whether he killed himself or whether someone else shot him doesn't seem pressing to the characters on the screen let alone the audience watching the film.As good as the painting technique is I think it is a smidge of a shame that the film is shot in 4:3 full screen. I understand this is an artistic decision that matches the paintings, but I do wish there wasn't so much empty real estate on my television for such a beautiful film.The Ugly: Look if you don't want to spend the coin getting the Don McLean rendition of Starry Starry Night, you should be able to find a better cover than the one that Lianne La Havas warbles at the end of this film. It isn't quite the Bahama Men 's version of Crocodile Rock from Crocodile Hunter Collision Course but still.In Conclusion: The fascinating part of Loving Vincent for me were the photos at the end of the real people in the movie. Not the actors mind you but the actual subjects. Marguerite Gachet, the young nineteen-year-old girl at the center of the mystery, didn't die till 1949. We think of Vincent Van Gogh as being so long ago, but in reality, it wasn't. Like the old west in America, it is a time that is in the distant past but still within reach. Or to use the standard measurement. Vincent Van Gogh is to Back to the Future's Enchantment Under the Sea dance as the Enchantment Under the Sea dance is to us today.",

            "content": "If you've ever had the privilege to see a Van Gogh up close, you know that the painting always seems to be in a state of kinetic motion, with its vibrant colors and furious brushstrokes. Loving Vincent takes that motion to the next logical step - it literally animates the paintings. A team of artists copied Van Gogh's works precisely - color for color, stroke for stroke - and then set them in motion, using them as the basis for a detective story of sorts tracing the last days of the painter's life.Watching this film, your eyes are dazzled over and over. You keep thinking, \"Haven't I seen this painting somewhere before?\" - and then, when you see the closing credits (which display the animators' reference materials), you realize that you have. Every character in this film is based on a person in Van Gogh's art, every backdrop is drawn from his landscapes. It took a lot of imagination to put all those parts together and make it a whole. (You're going to want to see this on a real theater screen if the opportunity presents itself. I'm not sure if the depth of the details will be conveyed in smartphone or tablet viewing).Other reviewers have pointed out that the story is the film's weakest point, and I will agree with that - I've knocked off a star for that reason. But, really, the story is not what you're going to be coming to this film for. With visuals this sumptuous, you don't really need an Oscar-quality script.I will say one thing about the story, though - kudos to the filmmakers for getting The Ear out of the way early on in the plot. You know going into a film about Van Gogh that it's going to be dealt with, you sit there half-cringing waiting for the moment . . . and the filmmakers made it one of the first flashback sequences. \"Okay, you all know it's coming, here it is. Now you can put that aside and focus on the rest of our film.\"It's not a film for everyone, but those who enjoy art should make a point of seeing this - and for admirers of Van Gogh, it's essential.(I'd love to see the Academy throw this film some love in the Best Animated Feature division, by the way - but you just know they're going to give the ultimate prize to the Big Disney Film Of The Year).",

I couldn't be more proud.The idea is simple - to bring Vincent van Gogh's imagination to life. It was splendid idea, he is after all one of the most recognizable painters ever. The story itself is more of a speculation than a statement. Whatever secrets Vincent took to his grave are still his and there's no conspiracy theories about that.I really enjoyed the editing of both film and sound. Afterall, there were no actors and every single movement of lips had to be drawn first. The resemblance is uncanny though. You can easily recognize Douglas Booth or Jerome Flynn. Furthermore, there're a lot of \"Easter eggs\" for an art freak like me. There're tons and tons of Vincent's paintings included in the film and it is a great way to get to know the people who was drawn by him.For me it is the damn winner.

The audacity to display a film entirely through oil-painted canvases was not only a challenge, the style also ensured authenticity and gave respect to the artist. It's a pity that these stressful tools are utilized to be an overlay for a bland BBC historical drama.The reason why I refer to Loving Vincent as a 'BBC historical drama' is due to the similarities in tone, script, and sound design. While intending to illustrate a setting in the 1800's, the film instead illustrates a manufactured modern setting that feels out of place. The script for the film is a very theatrical and bland. This aspect alone is what decreases the quality of the film in my opinion, as the film is dialogue-driven. As a result you're not invested due to the lack of engagement or immersion.Once I gleamed at the cast for Loving Vincent, I was concerned. Douglas Booth has always been a terrible actor in every film I've seen him in. However, he was surprisingly authentic for this film. However, the acting wasn't substantial at all, and drained the life out of the film in my opinion.If Loving Vincent was manipulated slightly, the film could be enjoyable as a visual experience, however the film is constructed by its dialogue.

            "content": "Loving Vincent tells the story of Vincent Van Gogh's death and the events that lead there. It does so the most astoundigly beautiful way one could possibly imagine:\nThe entire movie is an animation of oil paintings in the style of Van Gogh. Literally, every frame is an oil painting by itself. Though there were cases of overdrawn pieces in more statics sceneries which reduced the total number of \"surviving\" works to 1,000, there were over 65,000 frames hand-painted just for this movie. The look is typcial for Van Gogh, and the story - which is told in flashbacks and follows a man trying to deliver a posthumous letter, on his way encountering people who knew Van Gogh - incorporates many scenes that take place in Vincent's paintings, often showing the painting as an intrudction and then - throughout the scene - literally diving into the painting and e.g. exploring the house the famous piano-playing lady sat in. I find this to be an enormously creative way of realizing that movie, to really have the actual painting be actively involved not necessarily in the story, but in the visual storytelling. Another very fascinating detail are the \"cuts\". I mean, there really are no cuts because the paintings are continuously evolving frame-by-frame. Close-up face transform into street light reflections, corners of rooms become windows, everything is just so well thought-through and displays a level of creativity that I haven't seen before in any movie. Loving Vincent doesn't have huge twists or a complex plot, really. But it doesn't need it. It's somewhat of a biopic after all. It focuses of the visual storytelling, combining it with an easy-to-follow, quiet atmosphere of a man reconstructing Vincent's obsession for painting and the events leading to his death. It's dislogue-heavy, but almost all dialogues are kept interesting. I alays wanted to know what this and this person had to do with the painter and how they thought of him. I can strongly recommend this movie. Obviously to lovers of Van Gogh's art, but also to people who generally like asthetic filmmaking and a creative approach to cinematography. You can sit back, relax and be drawn into the world of oil paintings, and that's a wonderful thing to do",

            "content": "The very first fully painted animated feature film, each frame is an oil painting on canvas, using the same technique as Vincent van Gogh (in toto 125 painters are employed), apparently for its sheer workload alone, Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman's sui generis animation picture is a head-turner for both art lovers and cineastes. Concatenating van Gogh's extant works together as the backbone of a post-mortem journey examining Vincent's last days (with flashback in lowering black-and-white to counterpoint the present time's varicolored palette) on the pretense of delivering his final letter to brother Theo, the film consigns the task to a young man Armand Roulin (Booth), and through his encounters with many a Vincent's acquaintance, he becomes increasingly intrigued by the myth cloaking around his apparent suicide, raking through conflicting accounts and forensic evidences, Armand comes to the solution that Vincent is shot by someone else, presumably a local tearaway Ren\u00e9 Secretin, who habitually bullies Vincent but also profligate in paying tabs for his drinks. But when he finally has a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Dr. Gachet (Flynn), the man who is the closest associate of Vincent, the theory of murder is outstripped by the painter's sudden capitulation to taedium vitae, maybe the gun wound in his abdomen is not self-inflicted, but it does prompt his resignation to the Grim Reaper after all, an opportune incident to shuffle off this awful mortal coil, leaving 800-plus works behind. The film is a legitimate testament of the often overused filmic rhetoric \"every shot looks like a painting\", because they all are, and what is invigorating (apart from those final products' aesthetic exuberance) to see is the discernible \"moving painting\" flow and movement amongst each frame's transition, as in the stop-motion technique, and it introduces a salutarily animating effect to viewers even the story itself routinely rambling around. Also, a wheeze of applying real actors to enact all the story, pays off by keeping us rapt in looking deeper over their Post-Impressionist masquerade, to savor their acting in a way that is both layered and emphasized (tellingly Douglas Booth is a much eloquent actor with the camouflage), that is, for my money, the mainspring which makes this laboriously confected artifact the bee's knees in the face of its innately nondescript and over-reverent biopic treatment.",

The result is a visually unique film.The film follows a postman's son as he tries to deliver Van Gogh's last letter to his brother and finds himself investigating the artist's death. The murder-mystery approach is interesting and more successful than not, but it's really the art rather than the story that puts this over the top.While impressive, the purist in me was bothered that the animators cheated a little (as I see it). Some characters, particularly the protagonist, are far more detailed than anyone has ever been in a Van Gogh painting. This is especially true for the black and white flashbacks, which bear little to no resemblance to Van Gogh's rough black and white sketches. But it still looks great.With its solid cast, engaging story, and beautiful visual style, Loving Vincent is an enjoyable experience.",

You, playing as the main character, talk with people to get 'clues' or 'objects', and reveal the story along the way. This is common practice of an RPG game. For a movie, it is a bit too simple.

            "content": "'LOVING VINCENT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)'LOVING VINCENT' is the first fully painted animated feature film! It was created by a team of 115 painters, all using the same technique as Vincent van Gogh, to create every frame of the movie as an oil painting on canvas. The film is a biographical drama, all about the life, and in particular the death, of legendary painter Vincent van Gogh. It was written and directed by Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman (with Jacek Dehnel also serving as a screenwriter). The movie features the voice talents of Douglas Booth, Chris O'Dowd, Eleanor Tomlinson, Saoirse Ronan, Aidan Turner, Jerome Flynn, John Sessions, Helen McCrory and Robert Gulaczyk (as Van Gogh). It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards as well. I found the visuals to be very interesting, and the story too, but the movie itself is mostly a bore.The story begins one year after the death of Vincent van Gogh (Gulaczyk), apparently from suicide. Postman Roulin (O'Dowd) asks his son Armand (Booth) to deliver Van Gogh's last written letter to his brother, after multiple attempts to mail it failed. Armand does as his father asks, even though he didn't especially like Van Gogh, but he knows his dad was a big fan of his. Roulin is also suspicious about the cause of the painter's death, and he blames the townspeople for harassing and alienating the mentally ill artist. While trying to deliver the letter, Armand ends up interviewing multiple different people that knew Van Gogh, about his death. He begins to have more questions about the legendary artist's mysterious passing, and unusual life, than answers. The movie is of course always visually interesting to look at, although the animation method would have been better used on a film with a more visually striking story to tell. This film is made up of extremely long dialogue scenes, so the visuals are mostly just of people (and especially long shots of their faces). While the life, and death, and mental illness of Van Gogh is extremely fascinating, it could have been used to make a much more interesting movie than this. This film is excruciatingly slow-paced. I kept nodding off during it, even after I took a caffeine pill, and I rarely ever do that. It is a nice comforting film to fall asleep to, I guess though, and I honestly mean that as a compliment.Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us",

            "content": "An ambitious, audacious & assiduous art assignment that's realised by its creators in broad brushstrokes, Loving Vincent is a singularly impressive achievement of its genre that brings the life story of Vincent van Gogh to the film canvas in manners that's true to his spirits, and cements its spot in the annals of cinema by becoming the world's first fully painted animated feature film.Directed by Dorota Kobiela & Hugh Welchman, to have each frame oil painted on canvas for a feature-length narrative is undoubtedly a bold undertaking. And the end result of such arduous, painstaking craftsmanship bears a visual splendour so unique, immersive & dazzling that there is nothing quite like it. Every bit of its 95 mins runtime is a fusion of two distinct art forms, and it works.The film employs Vincent van Gogh's own style & techniques, be it his expressive brushwork, bold use of colours & impulsive strokes to bring its own images to life. The story itself is compelling, utilising different perspectives of the same incident to keep the mystery alive. All the actors play their roles responsibly. And lastly we have Clint Mansell contributing with a score that's as sad, tragic & melancholic as the great artist himself.Overall, Loving Vincent is bold, beautiful & breathtaking in equal measure and is one of the best films of its year. An unfathomably evocative biopic that emulates the elegance & aesthetics of oil paintings on film celluloid unlike anything before, Loving Vincent is a feast for the eyes that overwhelms like very few examples can, and is the closest cinema has come to bringing a painting alive on silver screen. Literally. Highly recommended.",

I can still remember movies such as \"Goya\", \"Frida\", \"Love is the devil\" or \"Girl with a pearl earring\" although I've seen them many years ago. Movies about painters aren't copies of other movies. The art of a painter can be an inspiration for shots and scenery of a movie. The life of a painter and his paintings can help to come up with an original plot.\"Loving Vincent\" contains hundreds of animations based on paintings created by Van Gogh. I wouldn't be surprised to see it in a short music video, but in a full-length movie it really comes as a surprise. I can recommend \"Loving Vincent\" just for that reason.The plot makes \"Loving Vincent\" a sort of a detective story. After allegedly suicidal death of Vincent Van Gogh his friend tries to establish the motives of Vincent's decision and all the events that led Vincent to the suicide. In my view that odd perspective of telling about Vincent Van Gogh and the \"detective\" plot of the movie are its weak points.Overall, though \"Loving Vincent\" is far from being a masterpiece, it's still an interesting and distinctive movie.",

A young man comes to Arles trying to learn more about the death of Vincent Van Gogh. Interesting, but nothing special.What makes the film important is the way it was produced. First, it was shot as a live film with actors. Then it was turned into animation. Then each frame was hand painted in oil. I can't even imagine the effort that was expended to bring this movie to the screen.Certainly, the effect is spectacular. The film has a psychedelic quality, and the colorful images leap off the screen right onto your retina. Here's a instance where you really have to see the movie to understand its impact.Loving Vincent has a very high IMDb rating of 7.8. I didn't think it was quite that good. Yes, it's colorful, but you can't see actors acting, and the plot is almost tacked on as an afterthought.Another drawback is that the movie won't work nearly as well on the small screen. It's really meant to be seen in a theater. We were lucky to be able to see it at the excellent Little Theatre, as part of the wonderful Rochester Polish Film Festival. If you decide to watch it on the small screen, you won't be sorry. However, I suggest that you read the reviews of other reviewers who liked it better than I did.

I have yet to research how much of this story is true to what is known, but this is no documentary, so the absolute truth isn't what is meant to be told here.

How the movie oh so slowly traps you in the final twist of unmatched parallel, in the end the movie and the journey we've taken is that of vincents own. It tells us that perhaps, no matter how wretched you may feel in this life, there's always the possibility for real change, to truly touch or affect another person for the better. Maybe you do so all the time without realizing it.It touches on confirmation bias. It hints at religious contradiction and hate, on our environments effect on us and our effect on it. All without compromising the plot and overall pacing being established.But most importantly, it weeps beauty. Every bloody frame of it. If not for story or out of passion for Vincet, you watch it for the simply astonishing work that was put into every frame of 'Loving Vincet', every last one is absolutely seren.The philosophy of the tortured artist might perhaps be more relevant now than ever before. The amount of creatives trying to transform their passion or their dream into their living has never been greater. As with the amount of failures.Maybe we need 'Loving Vincent' to come to terms with our own constant need to prove ourselves, so that we may find peace.In the end Vincent Van Gogh wanted the observer to know, here was a man who felt deeply, who felt tenderly.

They push aside the fact that movies are a business, one that employs millions of people around the world, that brings in tremendous amounts of money or that there is little art to be found in movies focused on explosions and bare breasts. But to some extent they're correct. Movies can indeed be an art form. Not as often as they'd like you to believe though. So when a movie does indeed become artistic that's to be applauded. And when that artistic expression is about art it makes it more magical.LOVING VINCET is a labor of love. It is an animated film unlike any other. Why? Because none of the images were painted by cartoon artists but by actual oil painters, over 125 classical painters from 12 countries to be precise. Together they painted 65,000 frames to tell this story. Director Dorota Kobiela has stated \"The basis for my idea was to tell my story through his paintings...It was always fascinating for me to think about the characters from his paintings telling his story.\"That story involves the last days of artist Vincent van Gogh as discovered by young Armand Roulin, the son of Postman Joseph Roulin. Joseph had a letter posted by Vincent and addressed to his brother, Theo, but the letter has continued to be returned. He entrusts the delivery of this letter to Theo to his reluctant son who feels it is a waste of his time. Armand heads for the address on the letter, the last known address for Theo. There he discovers that Theo also died but that he might want to take the letter to a Dr. Gachet in Auvers-sur-Oise.As his journey to deliver the letter progresses Armand begins to learn more about the man through the people he meets on his journey. Each of them provides him with clues as to the makeup of the man, what drove him, as well as their own theories about what happened to him in those final days. Some theorize that he committed suicide. Others that he was killed by one person or another. And some feel that the gunshot that took his life was nothing more than an accident.When Armand arrives at the town he is directed to the home of a Dr. Gachet, a close confidant and friend of Vincent. The doctor is away but Armand meets his housekeeper and see his daughter playing piano. He gets acquainted with the daughter of the local innkeeper who is away and hears her version of what happened. All of it is bits and pieces of fact and fiction, items seen and others gossiped about. But each one provides him with more information. As the days pass Armand begins to come to his own conclusion of what happened. His view changes with each new revelation. But before he turns the letter over to the last person deserving of it, he will come to a conclusion that puts all of the pieces he's learned into a plausible answer.The story itself here is a good one keeping you entertained and curious throughout. Was van Gogh killed or was it simply a mishap? Could he trust those around him or were they just taking advantage of him? Unappreciated at the time of his death he has since been hailed as one of the most influential artists of all time. Could those around him have seen this genius before others could or did they just think of him as mad?This story could have been told in a book. But film is a visual art. And the visual aspect of this film is amazing. Not only have they created an animated feature length film but every single image on screen has been painted to appear as if van Gogh painted them himself. Characters are based upon a number of his own paintings, bringing them to life to tell the story. It's as if the oils on canvases have come alive just to do so. Not an easy feat for anyone but this group of artists has accomplished the task.The film has been nominated for best animated feature film for this year's Oscars. The other titles in competition are all the standard computer generated images we've come to expect and a single cell animated entry. While all are quite well done it would be nice to see something like this win the award. It's special, magical and has the chance to use one art form to discuss another.",

Some tangents this fully animated film follows, involve some minor pornography, which appears as if it had been included for the sake of acquiring an M rating. Maybe this was a slight overindulgence that might also just keep it from some of its most valuable audiences. Otherwise, this is a grand emotional journey into the life and times of one of arts most neglected painters of his day. This aspect should perhaps also make us question the marketing manipulation that has taken art from the populace and placed it in the realm of business and sadly, often the corrupt within modern society. That said, those who passionately follow this tragic artist's life should be delighted with this visual treat - even if it might overwhelm some others with its highly unusual filmic treatment. *Recommended for the romantic and inspired viewer.",

While there remain many stigmas today around mental health, this movie leaves the question: how would Vincent's life have ended up if the society around him knew as much about mental health was we know today?The most praiseworthy aspect of the film is the animated frames which are all oil-painted in Van Gogh's unique style by over a hundred artists. The colours and images are as stunning as the paintings they emulate.While the viewer may never know all of the true details of this part of history, \"Loving Vincent\" provides a wonderful possibility of it. It's an enjoyable mystery as Armand discoveries more clues about the fascinating painter and a very moving film about life as well.\"Loving Vincent\" joins a list of other fascinating animated, international co-productions that include \"The Breadwinner\", \"The Red Turtle\", and \"The Illusionist\".OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: the animation",

            "content": "Animation has become somewhat easier since the days when every frame was drawn out by hand. This change has been mostly due to the use of computers to simplify the animation process. And yet, there are still those who want to embrace the painstaking process of manual animation, mostly for the artistic merit that it gives the film. Usually, this is done in short form, like the stop-motion film, Fresh Guacamole (2012) by PES, or the paint-on-glass animated short, The Old Man and the Sea (1999). Both of these short films were nominated for the Animated Short Oscar, with the latter winning the prize.With Loving Vincent (2017), we now have a feature-length (albeit at a short 94 minutes) animated feature that took the time to recreate the aesthetic of Van Gough's paintings via a plentitude of hand-painted oil paintings that comprised the individual frames of the film. If awards are given for artistic merit alone, Loving Vincent deserves to win all of them. I was in awe of how the famous paintings we all know came to life through the animation process, almost making me wish the movie would slow down so I could appreciate each brushstroke (some lathering on paint so thickly that the film could be considered \"3-D\").While I was dazzled by the animation, the plot was also pretty good, albeit probably the film's weakest point. I knew a few details about Van Gough's life, but the \"investigation\" of this film certainly made his genius and tragedy stand out. Not only did the film touch on mental health issues, but it highlighted how extraordinary Van Gough was. For someone who was in the art scene for a mere eight years, he made an incredible impact despite only selling one piece while he was alive.A visual treat and a heartwarming tribute, I give Loving Vincent 4.5 stars out of 5.",

The script and acting were similar to that of a Disney-fied historical piece; bad and unoriginal. My main qualm with this film, though, is the visuals. Every frame is painted to look like a Van Gogh painting and they do look similar at points, mostly in wider shots or natural settings. But, the problem is that most of the movie just looks like if whoever made the \"Take On Me\" video decided to start using stronger brushstrokes. When the camera moves, literally everything moves in a seemingly random fashion. I wouldn't be surprised if theater audiences got motion sickness. I get that the original work looks like that but there had to be a better way. The characters faces and clothes also, frequently, look out of place. Some of the character representations based on the original work did look rather authentic, though. There just wasn't much time during the film that I found myself unfrustrated.

Being the first fully painted animated film, it is a fascinating and often moving look into the life and death of the world-renowned tormented artist.One year after the suicide of Vincent van Gogh, a young man named Armand (Douglas Booth) travels to the artist's hometown to deliver a letter to Van Gogh's brother, Theo. Upon arrival, Armand learns that Theo has since died from syphilis, and decides to give the letter to Theo's widow instead. On his journey, Armand learns through various stories and anecdotes from the local townspeople about the type of person Vincent van Gogh really was, both positive and negative.Beautifully animated in Van Gogh's distinct art-style, Loving Vincent shines more light onto the life of the misunderstood painter who wanted nothing more than to find his purpose in life. Each frame shows the painstaking effort a team of 125 painters went to illustrate the beautiful and unique way in which Van Gogh likely saw the world. This film makes for a fine entry point for anyone wishing to know more about Van Gogh's life with only a passing knowledge of accomplishments. Douglas Booth does a fine job of playing Armand, someone who knew little about the artist's life but upon research gains a better understanding of the legacy he has left behind.I rate it 8/10",

            "content": "Here stands a film perhaps as oddly remarkable as the great artist whose demise it documents; Loving Vincent is a Polish-UK co-production charting the final days (and the shady aftermath of which) of Vincent Van Gogh. But what is truly extraordinary about this film is that it is the first animated film created entirely with oil paints, in the notable style of its eponymous painter. Loving Vincent is an ambitious visual experiment, every frame avowedly hand-painted in a pastiche of Van Gogh's work. It's an experiment that certainly works; landscapes swirl dreamily across the screens and oozing strokes of paint litter the faces of the film's players. There is something strangely ethereal about the animation; it's utterly immersive and beautiful and surely can be appreciated simply for its flair and the pain-staking commitment required to create it. The film was also shot in live-action beforehand; we see Chris O'Dowd, Saoirse Ronan and the rest of the cast embodied within the brushstrokes, in a strangely satisfying and delightfully expressive way. There's an effortlessness and innovation to the film's design; the same cannot be said, however, of its plot.\nThough not unenjoyable, Loving Vincent's plot is rather thin, comprised of exposition-packed flashbacks and uninspired dialogue. Over-narrated and over-simplified, it never really takes flight or makes much of an impact, despite numerous attempts. We watch as young Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) seeks to deliver a letter, at the request of his father, from a deceased Vincent to his brother, only to become hooked in finding out the truth behind the artist's death among the witnesses of his final days. The cast, led by Booth, are lively enough, but are not enough to distract one from a flimsy narrative that begins to feel like a tame episode of Poirot. Despite this, the film is entertaining enough and it's clear that the true intentions of directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman is to impress via the film's visuals rather than its story.\nLoving Vincent is a definite mixed bag of a film; visually, it's exquisite and never excessively dull, but its formulaic and uninspired plot cannot be ignored. For a movie that claims to be a biopic of Vincent Van Gogh, it tells us very little about the man itself, functioning far more as a standard who-dunnit that is gorgeous to watch but, on occasion, feels self-admiring. An interesting film that is worth watching just for its pure style.",

            "content": "Speechless! Loving Vincent movie is a work of a genius, of a combined effort of a team and a vision of directors who have immense knowledge about how to film a scene. What stands out almost immediately is the way it has been projected and portrayed on 65000 oil paintings by hundreds of artists from all across the globe, and such fine animation it retains that it would leave every innate motion to shame.The amount of work that has been put in and the gargantuan size of that effort will leave you marveling over what humans can achieve if they put their heart into something. It is an ideal paragon of colossal things that we can achieve when braided together.A Forgotten History\nLoving Vincent not only boasts of its teamwork but it also carefully builds itself over that thin edge of reverence and criticism that we often carry for forgotten people.For instance, so far I just knew that Vincent Van Gogh was one of the most brilliant painters of his time and that he was one ear short as portrayed in one of his self-paintings. I knew nothing of how, nothing about his life or the history that he became whilst trying to do one thing he loved to do - painting. Until of course, I saw Loving Vincent movie for myself, and everything changed. My very perception of this man I didn't know. I felt a hole in my heart being filled as I was able to relate to Vincent who had so much going on in his life.It is hard not to love him not for just the work he did, of which it speaks volume, but for a man trying to find his place in a world that failed to understand him. The latter relates to me on so many levels that I fell in love with the artist almost instantly.The Plot of Loving Vincent\nThe plot basically strands out from Vincent Van Gogh's life, as was consumed after death from the eyes of Armand Roulin from The Roulin Family It is voiced and painted on Douglas Booth who by the way fits right into the presumable boots of the original, of a man who had grown to hate Vincent. But as Loving Vincent progresses he comes to understand Vincent's mindset appreciating him all the way.Armand empathizes for him, wearing his shoes as he becomes him, literally sleeping in his bed to realize that the world was just too cruel for Vincent and that people failed to do enough.Full Spoilers and Analysis of Loving Vincent\nThere are questions that weigh on him of which he elicits answers from, but in doing so he becomes immensely affected. Trying to deliver Vincent's last letter which was given to Armand's father postmaster Joseph Roulin who was also one of Vincent's friends (he has been painted as well), Armand stumbles across many people who help him understand why Vincent shot himself starting from:Pere Tanguy (The Paint Supplier)\nLouise Chevalier (The Housekeeper)\nAdeline Ravoux\nThe Boatman\nMarguerite Gache\nYoung Man with a Cornflower\nOld Peasant\nGendarme Rigaumon\nDoctor Mazery\nDoctor Gachet\nBabes are like animals son. They can know the heart of a man just by the sight of them.As a side mission to delivering that letter, he takes upon himself to solve the mystery of the suicide as was asked of him by his father. Armand meets all kinds of people, the ones who hated Vincent to the core to the people who really adored him.Live longer, you will see. Life can even bring down the strong.The Past\nHe learns that Vincent was really close to his brother Theo (Cezary Lukaszewicz)to whom the letter was intended.Two hearts. One mind.Vincent's death had left him shattered.He had actually been with him a whole day at the end, but Vincent insisted they use the time to discuss life not death.Theo died six months after his brother. As a flashback of sorts, we get to relive the story of Vincent.He tried so hard to fit into his family. But, he never succeeded in this.Vincent's early life was a mess owing to how difficult he found it to find his place.He struggled to be what they wanted him to be.But when he picked up the brush when he was 28 (it's never too late to follow your dreams people) with Theo's support he was able to pursue it for real. Paris happened to him as Pere Tanguy (John Sessions), puts it:Everything that happens in art happens here.Vincent took it as a pitstop to learn before finally bidding farewell to Pere. The latter suggests Armand to see a certain Dr. Gachet (Jerome Flynn) whom he had seen crying the most at Vincent's funeral.Read full at Straight From A Movie site.",

However, I really enjoyed the story presented in this motion picture and I was pleasantly surprised by it, but I cannot give it a higher rating. I don't want to disprove the artists' talent and effort, but when I found out they actually filmed it before than made the paintings based on the video footage made it seem to me like it wasn't as artsy as advertised. Also, it was weird sometimes how Armand's was overly-detailed compared to the rest of the frame and sometimes you could see how they didn't change the background and only animated the characters (an effect which you could also notice in the old cartoons). \nAll in all, the film was a bit of a let-down in terms of the painted animation, but the story was impressive and gripping.

            "content": "When you have seen so many films in your life, the anticipation to watch something new raises your expectations, sometimes excessively. Unfortunately I was visually disappointed, possibly for being misinformed regarding the frames. The matter is that the movie was announced that 65,000 paintings were made but I do not quite agree with this data, on the contrary, constantly I felt I was watching South Park. A very graphic example of this and shown in most of the pictures, it is that for i.e., 10 frames aren't 10 different paintings but 1 that has been modified 9 times, and I'm sorry, but for me those are not 10 final paintings. One of the grossest examples is when windmill blades are turning: the corrections were poorly executed and after approximately the tenth correction, a massive one was made to cover all the previous small ones. I don't think I'm being too strict in this matter, what happens is that too many frames are too flawed, and those flaws, in my opinion, demerits the star of the film, which are the paintings themselves, in contrast to the scenes in black and white that do not have that type of visible corrections. I understand that the scenes in black and white were carried out differently to the color ones, however the transition of movement is completely different, my retina just cannot forgive it. To be clear on this point, except for the first painting of each sequence of paintings, the following ones looked like a drawing of a child who must erase and erase constantly different pencil strokes to complete the drawing, therefore leaving a trail of seen semi deleted strokes. In a child drawing however this is forgiven and the effort appreciated. The narrative didn't convinced me much either. However I understand that in this movie the narrative is just there to link Vincent's pictures first, and then to tell parts of his life. I feel the narrative in this movie just as a secondary component; but as the visual part in colors did not covered my expectations I needed to lean on the narrative to support the visual aspect. Unfortunately I could not do that. I have to say that I could not finish watching the move, it bothered me so much visually that had to quit halfway through it. Excellent idea, I applaud the boldness on changing the painting seasons, but mediocre execution in the frame-by-frame color paintings, poor music, for me it is a 5 stars movie.",

The oil painted frames are gorgeous to look at and are hypnotic in a stunning fashion. The story is told like a mystery and unfolds slowly but surely. I felt that the story lacked power but the end was quite emotional. The acting is very good. Douglas Booth, Josh Burdett, Holly Earl, Robin Hodges, Chris O'Dowd, John Sessions, Helen McCrory, Saoirse Ronan, and many others all perform very well. They all look stunning in every oil painted scene.The pacing is a little slow and the runtime is overlong even though the film is only an hour and a half.Pros: Beautiful oil painted scenes, great acting, and a good endingCons: Slow pacing, an overlong runtime, and the story lacked powerOverall Rating: 7.4P.S.

However, once you get past the amazing animation style you see a film that is pretty standard. The film follows the story of a man trying to deliver a letter to Vincent Van Gough's brother after Vincent's death. The deliverer meets many people who knew Vincent right before he died, and all of them have different opinions on him and how he died. This can be confusing because you have so many characters saying different and contrasting things about Vincent causing you to eventually be unsure whom to believe. With that in mind, I did not love the story and some parts of it got pretty repetitive and boring. The only reason I give this film three and a half stars is because the animation is so incredible to watch. I could not help but think, how the hell did they do this!",

Our protagonist is the postman's son, travelling to deliver Vincent's final letter to his brother, yet becoming something of a detective, questioning the characters he meets, trying to glean the truth behind his death. Ultimately an appreciation of the unique artist becomes more important than a definitive answer to the question.To paint every frame an oil painting in the style of Van Gogh must have been a painstaking process, yet a very rewarding one, as every frame is a joy to look at, and worth watching for that alone. How I wish more films were made in this style! However I am sad the writers used the opportunity to present a flashback conspiracy theory, as the mood of the story does not resemble the mood and poetry of the images themselves - a major let down! Layering synthetic dramatic music over this rural step back in time creates a further disconnect, and given Van Gogh is Dutch, and the film set in Europe, they really shouldn't have been speaking in English, with English accents.I really wanted to like this more, and it isn't bad viewing, but there are many differences between a film and a painting, the most obvious being the impact of story, and this one was told with not the same mastery it was painted.",

After viewing the trailer, I wondered if the concept of the hand painted animation would get old in the first few minutes. Well, it didn't. I can't wait to see this film again to see what I missed while I was carried away marveling at how certain flowers were painted or how they got the shading and expression on the characters' faces. I didn't want it to end. I loved that I felt I was looking at a full size Van Gogh and suddenly there was a figure walking through it. I think that it helped that it was on the large theatre screen as the visually dimension of the movie could easily be missed on a smaller screen. The characters are well played and the painters have done a wonderful job of giving dimension and emotion to them. The characters' eyes are amazing. The starry skies are amazing. The movie is amazing. The story line is interesting enough to carry the movie but not a blockbuster. Overall, I loved this movie.

The animation relentlessly recreating the style of Van Gogh is very heavy which I found distracts from the story where as the delicate black & white flashbacks are more easy to watch. What is also a negative factor for me is that all the characters are drawn to look exactly like the actors that are playing the parts which makes me think I would much rather see the actual live actors palying these roles as they can convey so much more than their animated counterparts no matter how well they're drawn and would have made the film far more emotionally satisfying.",

I don't believe that van Gogh didn't kill himself. Why I say that?, because Vincent spent time with idiots who get drunk and behave/play as cowboys and shoot with real ammo.

This tremendous achievement for live action animation genre surely is a treat to watch not only for the fans of the Father of modern art but also whoever is fond of different sort of animated films & art. Purely influenced by the works that Van Gogh had painted & using his same painting technique, each of the frame of the film (in total 65K!) is actually an oil painting on canvas, created by a team of more than 100 painters (source: The Making of Loving Vincent video & wiki)! The film also heavily revolves around the mystery surrounding the suicidal death of this troubled genius and that gave it kind of a feel of a mystery movie also. Not in a first person perspective, rather as point of view from the others who were somewhat close to him or observed him more or less closely, the film tries to captures the tragic life of a bullied & struggling Vincent, considered a madman and a failure, had a very unpleasant relationship with fame & fate during his lifetime as they never collided till long after his death. But the way the basic narrative was set in the film, it won't be as much appealing if they made it only as a live action film without this unique style of animation. So Vincent's own style of art, contributed by more than hundred of modern classical-painters saved this film and made it something very special. And last but not the least, a film about Vincent Vang Gogh would never be complete without Don McLean's one of the most moving & best songs ever...Vincent (Starry Starry Night). Though they should have added the original version but glad at least they added a cover version of it at the end credits.\u266a Now I understand What you tried to say to me And how you suffered for your sanity And how you tried to set them free They would not listen, they did not know how Perhaps they'll listen now \u266a \u266b",

Van Gogh was a Dutch painter that found his style in France. Yet the dialogue varies from actors with British or Irish accents. For God's sake at least let the French characters have a French accent if you don't have the balls to film in the actual language! The writers put together a script that resembles knock off Polish Hollywood because that is what it is. They proved to be poor stewards of his life.Vincent Van Gogh lived a fascinating life. This movie focuses on only on his death with stereotypical black and white flash backs to his past. It highly presses the flawed but recent theory of his death as truth. They want all viewers to believe that Van Gogh was a victim of Manslaughter if not murder instead of his mental illness. This dabbling in history is wrong and shows how little they understand the man and his art. This is the furthest thing from an Art film.....",

            "content": "I've never seen a film that looks like this one. As I understand it, the film was shot using the actors whose voices speak the lines of the animated images. A team of about 125 professional oil painters painted a reported 853 paintings in the style of Vincent van Gogh. These were used in various ways to provide each individual still frame of the film, of which there are over 65,000. The paintings were filmed and animated to bring the action and story to life. It is visually absolutely breathtaking, an amazing tribute to the painter generally credited as the founder of modern art.The story is set a year after the artist's death, when the postman who collected Vincent's nearly daily correspondence asks his layabout son Armand to hand deliver the artist's last letter, addressed to his brother Theo. He eventually sets off to the village of Auvers-sur- Oise, where the artist died. He becomes increasing fascinated by the circumstances of Vincent's death, and talks to nearly all of the people who had direct knowledge or perpetuated rumours of the events. Many of these people are subjects in Vincent's paintings, and so the film has an astounding quality of bringing familiar characters to life. The narrative is not totally satisfactory, but the visualisation more than makes up for this. The variety of voices of actors from various parts of the UK works, and I concluded that having the characters speaking French with subtitles would have removed the freedom to look at the visual scenes all the time, detracting from the visual impression. I suppose it has been dubbed for release in non English speaking countries. I wasn't familiar with many of the actors, but Chris O'Dowd as the postman Joseph Roulin sounded comfortably familiar, and his characteristic jerky and slightly awkward movement patterns were faithfully represented in the postman's animated movements around the scenes. It doesn't hold back from the intensity of Vincent's life, and is the stronger for this.The film, directed by Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman took nearly a decade to make, and I just hope that the amazing effort of the team is rewarded with a reasonable commercial outcome.

The most important part for me was that spectator has an ability to see Van Gogh's life so personally, by listening his letters, by recognizing his paintings or even stimulating imagination about what could possibly had happened. The viewer is not just some passive movie watcher, but part of the story, when you're getting angry at some events of his life, when you're sad, when you're smiling - all movie is so intimate and stimulating your senses through music, esthetical beauty of the paintings and the hole tragic story... His life, his work and personality comes alive in our heads again and we can just feel nothing more but to be thankful for this gift, called ''movie'' for directors.",

            "content": "Loving Vincent is a beautiful portrayal of Vincent Van Gogh's last days as an artist, told through the eyes of many characters who are talked to by someone desperate to find out what went wrong. This film's artistry cannot be underestimated, and the artists' love for Van Gogh shines throughout. It's unbelievable how over 100 artists came together to hand paint this film, having to do 65,000 frames in total. Their dedication to this isn't even the only thing that shows their love for the artist, for they did every frame in his style and incorporated many of his most famous paintings into various scenes. What's not to love?The cinematography isn't as good, honestly, due to primarily the fact that the entire story is told in flashbacks. I do not blame them for that, as introducing a character by flashback originally is greater than telling the story in the present, it just feels a bit like waking life as new characters are introduced all the time, who then proceed to all talk about Vincent, and it gets a little repetitive. I do, however, appreciate how well they weaved each character spoken to into the flashbacks, so that some of them that are seen while being talked about are not talked to 'till later. The title is referenced quite a few times, with a couple of sadder moments being driven by Vincent's own character actually talking without any overlay narration. The centre character looking into Vincent's death is actually quite intriguing, with a voice, a look and occasionally actions similar to those of an alcoholic, but with a softer side. In fact, many more characters are clever, including a doctor who is obviously mad. This is a cinema staple, and a work of art that you can't miss.",

Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman gave a tribute to this great artist by making an experimental animated biographical film. The story of the movie follows a postman named Joseph Roulin (Chris O'Dowed) asking his son Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) to deliver Van Gogh's (Robert Gulaczyk) last letter to his brother Theo. Joseph talks to his son who is reluctant to go. Armand sets out on his journey to Paris to deliver the letter but what he finds out during this journey is unexpected. The beauty about this movie is that each of the movie's 65,000 frames is an oil painting on canvas, created using the same techniques as Van Gogh by a team of artists drawn from around the world. The creators took some of his famous paintings and constructed a tale to tell. This movie is said to have invented the slowest form of filmmaking ever devised in 120 years. The appealing and enchanting images on screen along with some beautiful dialogues make this movie worth watching. The paintings of Van Gogh transformed into a cinematic experience is a tribute to the legendary artist.",

The way you feel of as these are real people it was just spectacular. The music oh yes the music, music is maybe my number one thing that I look forward to in a film because music could tell you a story it could move you in a certain way and the music in this film was composed by Clint Mansell which happens to be one of my favorite composer's of all time alongside just Hans Zimmer and Max Richter, I LOVED his music in The Fountain, Black Swan, Moon and Requiem For A Dream films, and in Loving Vincent I loved his work even more, he made the film just beautiful with his amazing music.

And those who don't should watch it to understand the magnitude of his talent and miseries at the same time. I had always looked at his works and tried to understand the use of colours, the emotions he was trying to display and the pain he expressed in his marvels like the Night Cafe, The Starry Night, Sorrowing Old Man, portrait of Dr. Gachet, Margaret Gachet and postman Joseph Roulin, Watching these paintings come to life and start talking to tell his very story is a surreal experience. Besides the astonishing fact that each and every frame in this movie is hand painted by oil on canvas, the movie has a gripping story, talented actors and does justice in telling the story of the one of the greatest painters that ever lived. The way the expressions came off so flawlessly just amazed me.While it explores the various theories and questions people had in mind about the exact occurrence of his death, it ends on a positive note.

It felt like a series of paintings (which is amazing), but I think it could have better been translated from art style into film style - into a film that emulates the art style, rather than a series of art frames emulated into a film style.Dialogue was kinda alright. The best line was the \"You spend so much time getting to know about his death, bit what do you know of his life?\" line. It didn't feel like it had a climax.Overall, it's a good film in itself, as a showcase of Van Gogh's work. It was a slow mystery, touching upon his passion and his depression.

            "content": "I went into this film hopeful, I had heard mixed reviews of the film, but was optimistic for at least a visual feast.1-The Visuals\nObviously there is so much hard work that went into the art design of this film, it is entirely painted, and that is to be commended. However, sometimes the art style (Van Gogh's style) doesn't work in movement, the flurry of colours over ever surface, constantly moving is distracting at points, and then there are points where, in order to make things easier for the animators, only the mouth is animated which is...odd...\nThe shot composition, based on Van Gogh's paintings, is also awkward, whilst it works in still paintings, it feels out of place in a film.\nA weird note, and somewhat of a personal opinion, the entire film is in a 4:3 aspect ratio (or similar), the aspect ratio of Van Gogh's paintings...However these aren't his paintings, this is a film, convert them for the cinematic form to at least a 16:9 aspect ratio, by revealing an image beyond the paintings we know. (A weird, pedantic point, I know, but it irked me)2-The Writing\nOh boy the writing...The narrative structure is painful, especially the first half, it is entirely going from person to person, asking them questions, then being told to go to the next person. The entire film is exposition, with very few moments where there isn't' boring, stilted dialogue. The characters (Save one character, who's there for about a minute) are boring and lack, well, character, they're all bland and one note. I didn't care what happened and was bored throughout.3-The Sound Design\nAnother weird pedantic detail, but the sound design was awful in this...It felt like I was watching someone play a point and click game (everything gives it this feel, the shot composition, writing, etc.), the sound effects were weirdly isolated and stood out like a sore thumb. The sound effects are weirdly stilted, and just don't match anything in the scene, partly due to the soft art style, contrasting with the hard sound effects. The music was also bland, which is a shame coming from Clint Mansell (His and Chris O'Dowd's names in the opening credits got me more optimistic for this film).4-Performances\nDespite some very good actors in there, the writing bogged the performances down into mediocrity, the lines delivered in a stilted manner, with little emotion there, not emotion that feels, well, emotional anyway, it all feels very fake...5-Conclusion\nDespite an art style that pays a lovely tribute to an amazing art style, it falls flat as a film, with all the above dragging the visuals down. If it wasn't for that art style, I think this film would be quickly forgotten as just a mediocre film, the art style and work that was put into it are the only things that really make this film distinct...\nBut hey, that's just my opinion, I'm not going to criticise you for liking this film, or tell you that you shouldn't, I have my tastes, you have yours, enjoy what you enjoy...",

            "content": "Visually, this movie is stunning. The entire concept behind the animation and working with the movement that exists in Van Gogh's art is a fantastic concept. No doubt, the animation is impressive and something unique in cinema. However, if the animation were removed from the film, and I was to watch the original unaltered footage, it would be a made for TV B-movie. The script hung together loosely through a string of clich\u00e9s and mediocre writing. While some of the actors, like Robert Gulaczyk, Jerome Flynn and Eleanor Tomlinson, did a good job and managed to make the awkward script come to life in a character that felt natural, there were other scenes in which I was cringing so much that I almost wanted to turn off the movie. It's such a shame that the immense effort put into animating this movie was not mirrored in the script, direction and acting.The entire premise seems to be depicting the events around Van Gogh's death as a sort of film noir crime investigation thriller, with a score to match, all of which I found completely at odds with the dreamy and ephemeral animation. A lot of components of this film just didn't hang together. It takes place in France, but everyone has British accents and I spent the first 15 minutes of the movie trying to figure who was who and where everything was taking place.The main character, Armand Rouland (Douglas Booth), is tasked by his father, the postmaster, with delivering a letter from the late Vincent van Gogh to his brother Theo, whom, unbeknownst to the postmaster, has also passed away. Armand gets intrigued by the circumstances surrounding Vincent's death and takes on the role of troubled detective looking for answers, interrogating people involved in Vincent's life with an accent and manner straight out of a Guy Richie movie. Except, he's actually the son of a mailman in 19th century provincial France, and this attempt at a period piece become increasingly confused as Armand belligerently stalks complete strangers and pries into their personal lives for answers which have no rational reason to be any of his business other than to drive the plot of the movie forward.The story does provide a complex portrayal of the character of Vincent. The aesthetic of the movie is displayed through the eyes of Van Gogh's artistic vision, however we don't truly see the world through his eyes, but rather, we follow the internal struggles of Armand, which adds a lot of unnecessary (and historically inaccurate) drama, detracting from the artistry of what could have been an incredible movie. The idea of bringing Van Gogh's paintings to life by featuring his art subjects as the main characters of the movie could have been brilliant. The film Waking Life comes to mind as masterful example of what Loving Vincent failed to achieve. The dreamlike quality of the visuals are emotive in and of themselves, and the art could have spoken more for itself, with the narrator drifting between the stories of subjects, rather than hunting them down and interrogating them through the lens of his own emotional turmoil. I really wanted to like this movie, but I just felt incredibly disappointed at the end.",

The incredible work done by the painters has produced an outstanding, breath-taking result. The paintings of Van Gogh come alive, the persons he painted begin to move and speak. With the narrator character we can visit the places he visited. It's really an extraordinary project. For the esthetic appeal and the genial/crazy idea of the paintings-based movie I'd have given 10 stars. I can't help but remember Kurosawa's Dream (about Van Gogh) and The Mill and the cross (about Brueghel's The Way to Calvary), but also What dreams will come (with Robin Williams).I'm somewhat perplexed about the story-line though. Watching the movie one has the sensation to be in a computer game, the narrator moving from one character to another, trying to come to the truth. It is surely a modern way, maybe it'd be too much to demand more serious solutions for an animation movie, as it is. Also, it resembles a detective story that seems to suggest a murder, but in the end it dissolves.",

The story itself is interesting enough, however, the most exciting part is that it was the first-ever fully painted animated film. In other words, the film was fully animated through oil-painted frames. According to the production team, the film used 65,000+ oil paintings on canvas, drawn by 100+ artists around the world. It took 4+ years to complete this masterpiece.\"Loving Vincent\" explores the sudden death of Van Gogh, trying to find the truth. The main character Armand begins an investigation from the last day of his death. He visits various people around Van Gogh. But as the story goes deeper, the initial question of \"why\" he died becomes less important. Instead, the story centers around \"who\" he was, as a painter and as a man. The audience gets to know what inspired van Gogh through a unique cinematic experience. Many characters and landscapes in the films were inspired by actual paintings of Van Gogh himself. In the ending credit, we get to see which scene was inspired by the original Van Gogh's works side by side, which is one of the interesting elements of watching this film.Every scene is carefully created in Van Gogh's iconic painting styles. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the filmmakers, the experience was astonishing. The facial expressions, the sounds, and even the lighting, every little detail resulted in perfect harmony.

            "review_title": "Loving Vincent and Mythology",
            "content": "Loving Vincent is miraculous for the fact that a film of such high concept actually came to fruition. A feature-length animated film entirely hand-painted in a style imitative of Vincent Van Gogh sounds almost absurd. Yet it happened - the film was made. Not only that, but it is a very good film; not just for its bare artistic conceit but for its execution. The expected, inevitable appropriation of specific paintings could have been cheesy or snarky, but they are integrated well and do not linger over-long. Even their placement is appropriate - for example, the filmmakers took the care to use Van Gogh's scenes of Auvers in the scenes set in Auvers. That seems a low standard, but even that level of care is not terribly common. And the film features Saoirse Ronan and Jerome Flynn (a dead ringer for Doctor Gachet).\nOne particularly appreciable aspect of the product is that one can discern where one painter's work ends and another begins. While they are all imitating Van Gogh's signatures quite well, catching even many of the subtleties of his painting, one sees his various shades, so to speak. The depth to which different artists interpret him differently is an admirable feature. Certainly the narrative and the script are flawed, but to dismiss the film on that front feels too cynical - the real point of the movie's existence is the painting. And while the narrative may be somewhat meager, it has many clever aspects to it that I think go overlooked. The same can be said for the script. In a clever inversion of typical cinematic tropes, the flashbacks throughout the film are actually rendered in a more realistic style; less dreamily, less impressionistically (though they are rendered in black-and-white). The most abstract, swirliest of Van Gogh's style is invoked in the actual dream sequences.\nThe score by Clint Mansell is quite effective. I like Mansell's work, despite how formulaic it can be. His approach, driven by identifiable leitmotifs and largely static harmonies suits the dreamlike tone of the film. It can be overly mournful and even melodramatic at times, but those times pass quickly enough.\nThe film is sensitive to the various contradictory impressions of Van Gogh as given by different people who knew him - a central part of the Van Gogh mythology.\nThe mythology is a lingering interest. The tortured-artist persona often applied to Van Gogh has been cited as inaccurate and even harmful, not just to Van Gogh's legacy but to the reality of life for creatives in the modern day. It is true that the man suffered with mental health issues, probably including bipolar disorder (Zimbardo, Johnson, McCann, Psychology: Core Concepts), and, one imagines, some degree of psychosis - the infamous ear incident being the elephant in the room.\nIn some ways, arguably, the tendency to mythologize the starving artist is a comfort. A blurry, nobly, romantically valorous individual who sacrifices comfort, luxury, even mainstream society for a grander purpose is an attractive idea to self-apply. Artists are rarely noted for their humility. Living as a creative has always been a struggle (except in the cases of those select few lucky enough to find consistent financial and critical success early in their careers. Don't we hate those people?) It can feel like a last gasp of hope for those creatives facing serious struggles; that even if one never reaches financial stability, let alone success, in one's lifetime, one can still leave an impact that is remembered and valued in memoriam.\nThe film seems more to acknowledge the mythology rather than contribute to it. It has one character note the conspiracy theories that Van Gogh may have been shot by someone else, but it doesn't linger on the idea. And of course the very central conceit of the intensely varied impressions that Van Gogh left on the people in his life is part of the mythology. The focus on his numerous letters is another part (a Penguin Classics edition of his collected letters sits on my coffee table beside me as I type this).\nIf the mythology will persist, which it seems it will, at least it seems it can and will serve as a comfort to those struggling, if also a harmful expectation and an excuse to exploit.\nThe film is flawed, and when I first saw it I felt, to a degree, that it hadn't truly lived up to expectations. After a few repeat viewings, I find it more compelling than I had previously given it credit for. There is certainly more to appreciate than just the painting, as breathtaking as that is. I'm not sure if it has much, really, to add to the conversation, but that is not the point. The film is about appreciation - of Van Gogh's work, of the poignancy of his life story, and of the simple act of creation itself. What else could drive a team of hundreds to paint thousands of frames, by hand, in linseed?",

Beautiful colors such as soft greens, blues, and neutral yellows follow Armand on his journey to deliver the letter to Theo. On his journey, Armand meets many people who have encountered Vincent Van Gogh or who have known about the famous painter. As his journey continues, it is clear to see the stagnant theme that the movie was painted in. The famous painting, \"Starry Night\" seemed to follow through the whole entire movie. Impasto painting is incorporated throughout the entire movie, which is Van Gogh's famous way of painting. Impasto is thick, dry oil paint raised from the surface. What also is noticeable throughout the movie is how the moving characters and objects look as if they are almost in a stop motion movie. The stills look as if they were taken picture by picture and moved into strategic ways to fit if the character would be moving or if a scene was interactive. Much of the movie looked very realistic from what is portrayed, but like mentioned, it is all paintings. Flashbacks occur with each person Armand comes in contact with in black and white, but still stays the same with the \"Starry Night\" and stop motion theme. Many recalled their encounters and conversations with Vincent Van Gogh. This gives the audience a better understanding of who Vincent Van Gogh really was and to take a deeper look into his love for painting. Vincent Van Gogh was truly gifted and is not like other painters. All he wanted to do was paint regardless of what the weather was like. His passion for painting was simply unmatched.",

            "content": "The film dives into Vincent's last few weeks of life. The movie shows the subjects of his paintings and is composed in a style like Vincent's. The technique in showing the pictures of the film is almost identical to Van Gogh's style of painting, with the palette knife's imprints most visible. This film is composed in such a unique way that truly paints Vincent's individuality and distinctiveness. The narrator and investigator Armand Roulin goes on a hunt to find Vincent's brother Theo. However, upon finding about his death, Roulin makes it his mission to find out the truth about Vincent's death. However, like his life, not one person indefinitely knew his truth. With the different stories going on about his death, Roulin relied on Van Gogh's letters. Through his journey to find the truth, Roulin is shown to become mad over time, like Van Gogh.The film goes a great job of describing Vincent and showing the side of his life that some may not be exposed to. Although the film included the version of him that many seen, the \"lunatic\" and crazy one, the film also portrayed Vincent's polite side, his passionate side. The production of the film over time with the Roulin's character also becomes disturbed, much like Vincent's personality. Many of the characters that Roulin interviews seem to always ask questions about Vincent, about his choices - which paints the mysteriousness around Van Gogh's life.This film is truly a masterpiece due to the way in which it captures Vincent's life. Throughout the film, it becomes evident to the watcher that they may not ever get the answer they had hoped for, however, the reality behind Vincent's life is still in question. The movie does a great job showing all the people in which he had close relations with - the doctor, the doctor's daughter, and most importantly his brother. Visually, the film did a wonderful job keeping the audience informed about Vincent's life. The film becomes more credible as they use his letters as a means to portray Vincent.Overall, this film with its storyline, production, and visual aspects was great. It did a wonderful job portraying and explaining Vincent's life through credible sources. Although this film portrayed him as a mastermind, it did not give Van Gogh an idealistic image, however, focused on how Vincent was perceived by others and himself. The movie references many of the great Impressionistic ideologies such as the emphasis on light and the subjects of Vincent's work. It was one of the best biography movies I have seen.",

            "review_title": "Loving Vincent: A beautiful experiment",
            "content": "This is a film that starts by acknowledging over 100 artists that were involved in the literal oil painting of each of its 65,000 frames. Indeed, such a craftsmanship should be recognized and celebrated. This film is like nothing you've ever seen before. Surely, some independent animated films have attempted something like this in scenes or sequences but never in full length.Directors Dakota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman have achieved something that hopefully will inspire more artists and filmmakers to push the boundaries of what can be made with this style of movie-making. Extra credit should be given for being able to fund it partially through Kickstarter and also by the Polish Film Institute. It was through the festivals circuit that this film was able to thrive and get a wide distribution as it should have. More work as this must be viewed around the globe.However, as in most experiments there are some flaws that almost stopped the final product from thriving beyond the mere invention. Though groundbreaking in its visual aspect, the story and the way it flows from scene to scene makes the rhythm feel stalled at times. At some point it actually makes you think that this could be better fitted in a series of short films.The story is about Douglas Booth's character who is trying to deliver a letter to the Van Gogh family while also trying to uncover the mystery of Vincent's death. Here lies the basic story. Some turns and twists happen throughout, yet they feel added just for the sake of adding more suspense. A big problem lies in the main character's lack of depth or personality who only marvels at the life and work of the title artist between cigars and monologues. It's as if he was a physical manifestation of every fanatic of Van Gogh's work, existing for the main purpose of telling you how great he was.The main character also tries to function as a form of detective. I use the term \"tries\" as he clearly really fails to do any exciting detective work, for every secondary character is the one in charge of developing the story and giving important information. The result is a film that feels painfully episodic, jumping from one character's narration to the next. Whether you know the actual story of what happened during Van Gogh's final days or not the film invests most of its narrative trying to make a mystery out of it. Again the success of this mystery from time to time succeeds as some vignettes don't really work and feel empty and soulless. Even with all the movement and color in the frames.Speaking of color, it's unexpectedly fun witnessing the \"Van Gogh-ization\" of the whole cast. It's quite the feat from the painters to be able to allow the actor's emotions come through their work. It's distracting in its formality yet in a surprisingly good way as you look more in detail at the \"actor's faces\" for those soft reactions and movements. It's hypnotizing and psychedelic at times. In the end that is the saving grace, its rich visual and inventive style. The work of every artist results in a marvelous piece of art that was sort of attempted before in Richard Linklater's \"A Scanner Darkly\" and \"Walking Life\" yet in a more baroque and raw manner. Each stroke is felt and gives a certain \"Je ne se quoi\" that suggests that there's no better formal manner of conveying this story. Clint Mansell's soundtrack is fittingly delicate and contemplative even melancholic. It's a great companion for most scenes as they never add melodrama or unnecessary tension. In fact, it's used as a sort of thread that joins the scenes jumping from past to present and from grayscale to color.This film is bound to be remembered and taught in animation film schools. And for good reason. Each frame drools with the passion and technique of the painter. The decision to hire painters and not traditional animators really succeeds, for instead of creative character designs or animation, the effort is put in the color palette and strokes that can be achieved only through oil paint. This is the work of Vincent Van Gogh's fanatics who really wanted to create a tribute to an artist that foolishly wasn't celebrated in his lifetime. There's no more fitting title for the piece than \"Loving Vincent\" as sometimes loving something or someone too much can lead to some dangerous misguidance and oversights. Oh, but there's no denying that such love and passion is something to be admired and treasured.",

            "content": "The Movie Loving Vincent really stood out to me from how the whole movie was stop motion of hand paintings from 100 painters from around the world. I think the highlight of the movie was the style of the paintings. They were all in the same painting style of Van Gogh. At some times the movie would change to black and white and even with the black and white paintings, it still was in the style of Van Gogh. This movie was very interesting by how the plot of this movie was like a mystery. Many people who Vincent painted portraits of, were in the movie as characters which I believe brings to life of Van Gogh paintings even more. I really enjoyed when it went dived into each charter Vincent painted and how they knew Van Gogh and memories they had with him. Most of this movie took place in France and some parts in Paris. I think the way the movie was depicted how Paris would look during that time period. The industrial revolution was happening during that time, so trains as transportation surged, which a character took a train to travel to Paris in the movie. I would rate this movie a seven point five out of ten, I think what made this movie stood out was that many painters around the world came together to bring Van Gogh life and art to make this movie about him, and all were able to paint these with Van Gogh style of painting. The only critique I would give is that were was some slower parts in the middle of the movie and it was pretty predicable of how it was going to end. Overall, I would recommend watching this movie, I think it goes in Van Gogh life that not everyone would know.",

            "content": "This film begins a year after Vincent's death and follows Armand Roulin. Roulin, who was set out by his father Joseph, is determined to return Vincent's last letter to his brother Theo. We follow Roulin on his journey to meet those with personal tales of the artist and begin to devour the mystery of Vincent's life and death.This film is extraordinary even if you were to remove the plot. Over 65,000 slides were hand painted and combined to create an incomparable movie experience. If you are a lover of art in any regard, you will recognize many of the paintings this film brings to life and, even more incredible, being able to see these spaces through Vincent's eyes. It is easy to feel the tragedy of Vincent while following this story of those who admired him. However, I find the making of this film the ultimate love letter to Vincent, as we stretch a hand from our time to his time connecting us in a profound way to the prolific artist.Though not entirely accurate throughout, the filmmakers portray many of the important aspects of Vincent's story well; the Gaugin feud and the ear lost because of it, Vincent's loving relationship with his brother, and the mysterious circumstances of his \"suicide.\" It may not be a perfect tool to study Art History with, but it does give the viewer a first-person look into what Vincent must have been like and how much we wish we could rewrite history for him. Toward the end of the film, Armand, fed up with the mystery himself is told by his father Joseph \"There is a whole other world up there. Something we get to gaze upon but do not fully understand. It\nreminds me of him.\" This quote answers our endless questioning of the strange artist and tells us we will never understand what truly transpired but we can love him, nonetheless.",

            "content": "I enjoyed that Loving Vincent was created with the same impasto art style that his collections of works reflected. It is impressive how they essentially made his painting style come to life and beautifully told a story. The movie had a mysterious plot and showed us how many people never really knew what happened in the aftermath of Vincent Van Gogh's passing and how it affected the people around him. Everyone gave a different version and described him differently, which makes you question who he really was. He was painted as evil by many and others adored him. It's apparent that in his short life as a painter he impressed other influential artists like Monet. Monet went as far as saying Vincent was the Shining Star of the Independent Artist's Fair. We get to see how loving and supportive his younger brother Theo was toward his passion for art. He may have had a rough childhood, but it is good to see that he was able to have the support of his brother through the years. Vincent loved his brother and wrote meaningful letters that are still a significant part of art history today.In the end, there really is no right answer on whose version to believe of what happened. Some truth may have been told by everyone, but it is only Vincent who really knows how it all went down. This was a great movie to learn more about who Vincent was and how he influenced others. The movie pays tribute to Vincent by being done in the same style he drew and recognizes that he was important and had a purpose. He has inspired many people and it is a disgrace that while he was alive those around him did not value the art pieces he produced. Overall, I would give this movie an 8/10 as I adore the aesthetic that this movie exhibits and am fascinated by the storytelling.",

            "content": "This being the first oil-painted animated movie, in the style of Van Gogh, the visuals can be hard too get past in the beginning. However, the movement of the characters and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking, and only makes the movie more interesting to watch. At first, I was worried the movie would focus on portraying Van Gogh's death solely as a suicide, but I was glad to hear Dr. Mazery's statement about the angle of the bullet wound! There's not enough evidence to say that was/wasn't a suicide, but I was very happy that the producers acknowledged the holes in each story - as well as how they redirected the focus to Vincent's work and the effect he had on those around him. Not only that, but I loved how many of his works were incorporated throughout the movie - it only adds to the life-like quality of the oil-painted animation. My one criticism has to be the accents - why do many of the characters sound British? The majority of the film is set in Auvers-sur-Oise, France, so I was a little surprised not to hear any French accents, especially when many of the characters have last names like \"Chevalier,\" or \"Gachet\" (although I understand that a French accent is harder to pull off than a British accent). Nonetheless, I think they did a great job conveying the complexities of Vincent without actually giving him a direct role - I'd rather leave his character up to interpretation. Overall, beautifully done!",

I felt like I could see the emotion in the various characters eyes, with hints of teardrops appearing in the corners of their eyes and the like.\n\nI am quite a big fan of animation, have always been since a child, so this film had appealed to me for a long time and I honestly can't say it disappointed. I was both interested to see it in terms of the painting work used to create it but also in terms of being interested in the story of the troubled person who was Vincent Van Gogh and this film certainly taught me more about him. I was aware of his time spent in Arles, in France, having visited the area a few summers ago and this place features in the film, so I found it very interesting, with good voice work from the cast, including Josh Burdett, Holly Earl, John Sessions, Helen McCrory and Chris O'Dowd.\n\nEven if your not especially keen on Van Gogh, I would still recommend it as a different type of film from 'regular' CGI based animation or the like. However, I should probably point out that this is rated 12 in the UK due to the theme of mental illness being inevitably present but also there was a scene depicting a prostitute with a customer and the infamous gifting of Vincents cut ear is also depicted, so I wouldn't recommend it be shown to pre-teens certainly.",

Loving Vincent is landmark event for animation and even biographical storytelling through its majestic vision at the last days of Vincent Van Gogh.\n\nSet a after the death of fabled painter, Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) is possessed with a letter from Van Gogh to his brother Theo before his death, and begins the journey to deliver it. While on call, Roulin encounters all the people close to Vincent before is death gradually trying to put the pieces of what cause his sudden suicide. From this we are taken back to key moments of Van Gogh's life mesmerizingly displayed through the living oil paintings.\n\nGenerated by 65,000 paintings by over a 100 artist, Loving Vincent is living work of art. First shot as a live action depiction then adapted into paintings, the immersive gallery of scenes is a first in new format of animation. Directors: Dorota Kobiela, and Hugh Welchman take Van Gogh's own artistry into his own biography (almost), from Citizen Kane style narrative, assessing and celebrating the life of one of the worlds if not the most famous painter. From this production becomes transporting cinema experience into the world of Van Gogh and an enchanting watch of magnificent painting and animation.\n\nOf course what is the fundamental strength of Loving Vincent is its captivating artwork which for every moment is spectacular, and then you have the real narrative of Van Gogh's last days which on its own is an affectionate journey. Even if you don't not much about the life of Van Gogh this is an enthralling experience.\n\nThe monumental presence of the paintings is consistently exceptional with wonderful detail and creation put into it. One of the sensational efforts for the film is its sketch of the real actors, making them instantly recognisable on screen, bringing their performance into the art. Although our eyes are set on visual presence, Clint Mansell's score is also a tear-jerking atmosphere throughout the film, capturing the melancholy as well as joy of Van Gogh.\n\nLoving Vincent is a visual sensation, proving the amazing talent that animation brings to the screen. This is by far one of the most significant films of the year and is must see experience, especially for art students.",

Every scene of the movie is beautiful and it delivers everything that the people expected it to in the artistic aspect. There is so much going on in each frame that you might often ignore the plot and appreciate the beauty of this one. The story is still very strong for me, it's not one detective story where we find the cause of death of Van Gogh. I believe we all play Armand, the lead character, trying to find the cause of his death. We're told the story of Vincent through people, through their memories, we see the different perception of people towards Vincent. While of course each one of us wants to find the cause of death, we soon realize the futility of doing so. Numerous people might not like the story but the film represents the legacy of Van Gogh left behind in his paintings and in people, in their time with Vincent. It's about how legacies survive long, long after the person dies and how even a self-hating painter believed that his legacy would also survive.",

            "content": "Loving Vincent (2017): 7 out of 10: An art film in more ways than one, Loving Vincent is the tale of a postmaster's son asked by his father to deliver a letter from Vincent Van Gogh to his brother Theo. \n\nSoon this simple task becomes a journey into finding out why Vincent van Gogh committed suicide or even if he did. What we end up with is a Rashomon style story where everyone in the small provincial village where Vincent died has a different and often conflicting story. \n\nThe Good: Let's start with the six hundred pound oil painting in the room. Loving Vincent has a gimmick, and it is a doozy. Each frame (all 65,000 of them) are handpainted by a group of 120 painters. The actors are then animated and rotoscoped onto the oil paintings. \n\nNow I know rotoscoped is a scary word. We all remember Ralph Bakshi use of rotoscoping for his animated features Wizards (1977) and The Lord of the Rings (1978). Scary times indeed. Loving Vincent's technique, guided by a bigger budget and forty years of technology improvements, is spot on. \n\nThe settings and many of the characters are right out of Vincent Van Gogh's paintings, and scenes often start with a classic Van Gogh painting and then has the action seamlessly move on from there. Whether in movies or even video games such gimmicks often lose their effect after viewing for a while. While I certainly got used to the technique in Loving Vincent, it never became unnoticeable. \n\nThe Bad: Loving Vincent is a quiet tale that fails a task one can give biography. Would this story be interesting if it happened to someone not famous? The answer here is a solid no. The movie's story reminds one of a walking simulator video game rather than a film with our protagonist walking around chatting people up and then going into flashback cutscenes (Done in a different black and white sketch style like that Take on Me a-ha video). We get a decent picture of Vincent in his last days and the people around him, but the central mystery of whether he killed himself or whether someone else shot him doesn't seem pressing to the characters on the screen let alone the audience watching the film.\n\nAs good as the painting technique is I think it is a smidge of a shame that the film is shot in 4:3 full screen. I understand this is an artistic decision that matches the paintings, but I do wish there wasn't so much empty real estate on my television for such a beautiful film. \n\nThe Ugly: Look if you don't want to spend the coin getting the Don McLean rendition of Starry Starry Night, you should be able to find a better cover than the one that Lianne La Havas warbles at the end of this film. It isn't quite the Bahama Men \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~s version of Crocodile Rock from Crocodile Hunter Collision Course but still. \n\nIn Conclusion: The fascinating part of Loving Vincent for me were the photos at the end of the real people in the movie. Not the actors mind you but the actual subjects.  Marguerite Gachet, the young nineteen-year-old girl at the center of the mystery, didn't die till 1949. We think of Vincent Van Gogh as being so long ago, but in reality, it wasn't. Like the old west in America, it is a time that is in the distant past but still within reach. Or to use the standard measurement. Vincent Van Gogh is to Back to the Future's Enchantment Under the Sea dance as the Enchantment Under the Sea dance is to us today.",

            "content": "Here stands a film perhaps as oddly remarkable as the great artist whose demise it documents; Loving Vincent is a Polish-UK co-production charting the final days (and the shady aftermath of which) of Vincent Van Gogh. But what is truly extraordinary about this film is that it is the first animated film created entirely with oil paints, in the notable style of its eponymous painter. Loving Vincent is an ambitious visual experiment, every frame avowedly hand-painted in a pastiche of Van Gogh's work. It's an experiment that certainly works; landscapes swirl dreamily across the screens and oozing strokes of paint litter the faces of the film's players. There is something strangely ethereal about the animation; it's utterly immersive and beautiful and surely can be appreciated simply for its flair and the pain-staking commitment required to create it. The film was also shot in live-action beforehand; we see Chris O'Dowd, Saoirse Ronan and the rest of the cast embodied within the brushstrokes, in a strangely satisfying and delightfully expressive way. There's an effortlessness and innovation to the film's design; the same cannot be said, however, of its plot.\nThough not unenjoyable, Loving Vincent's plot is rather thin, comprised of exposition-packed flashbacks and uninspired dialogue. Over-narrated and over-simplified, it never really takes flight or makes much of an impact, despite numerous attempts. We watch as young Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) seeks to deliver a letter, at the request of his father, from a deceased Vincent to his brother, only to become hooked in finding out the truth behind the artist's death among the witnesses of his final days. The cast, led by Booth, are lively enough, but are not enough to distract one from a flimsy narrative that begins to feel like a tame episode of Poirot. Despite this, the film is entertaining enough and it's clear that the true intentions of directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman is to impress via the film's visuals rather than its story.\nLoving Vincent is a definite mixed bag of a film; visually, it's exquisite and never excessively dull, but its formulaic and uninspired plot cannot be ignored. For a movie that claims to be a biopic of Vincent Van Gogh, it tells us very little about the man itself, functioning far more as a standard who-dunnit that is gorgeous to watch but, on occasion, feels self-admiring. An interesting film that is worth watching just for its pure style.",

Notably, all of the paintings are in the unmistakable style of Van Gogh - and some of his works are reproduced (of course).  So, the film is amazing to look at and takes me back fondly to my memories of the Van Gogh exhibit here in Melbourne last year (the wheatfields and the crows).  The plot follows the son (Armand) of Van Gogh's friend and subject Postman Joseph Roulin who travels to Paris after the painter's death to deliver a letter from Vincent to his brother Theo.  When Theo turns out to be dead, Armand travels to Arles to interview the people who knew Vincent at the end, including Doctor Gachet and Marguerite Gachet (voiced by Saoirse Ronan).  He comes up with a theory that Van Gogh might have been murdered rather than a suicide; however, I'm not sure this really adds enough tension to the plot to sustain interest.  Having recently watched Kirk Douglas as Vincent in Lust for Life (1956), I knew many of the details of the painter's life and perhaps the plot could be less clear without this background knowledge.  The remake of Don McLean's \"Starry, starry night\" playing over the end credits is a nice touch.",

I had the good fortune to watch this movie with an artist who was pulling up all the paintings the film was paying homage to, which did wonders to increase my appreciation for how well the animators were able to replicate Van Gogh's work. The script has some problems, it's mostly just a series of people telling stories about Vincent as the protagonist goes around figuring out why he died. It's a really interesting approach, but it does cause the movie to have a plot that doesn't feel very active or urgent. As a result it does drag a bit at points. But Loving Vincent delivers where it counts: with unique and magnificent animation.",

It fascinated me from the moment I watched the trailer months ago.\n\nArmand, the postman's son, a man with little to no aspirations, arrives at the last hometown of the painter to deliver his last letter. The audience dives into the story through his eyes, the eyes of a stranger, providing a fresh perspective as the character's curiosity, and our own, unravels an unexpected mystery.\n\nVisually stunning, the creators of this piece of art in animated form set out to achieve the impossible, to tell the story of the last days of Vincent Van Gogh's life through sixty-five thousand paintings.Loving Vincent\n\nThe art form of film is different from painting. Painting is one particular moment in time, frozen. Film is fluid, seeming to move through space and time. So, prior to and during the live action shoot the painting design team spent a year re-imagining Vincent's painting into the medium of film.\n\nLoving Vincent was first shot as a live action film with actors then hand-painted over frame-by-frame in oils. The final effect is an interaction of the performance of the actors playing Vincent's famous portraits, as well as the painting animators, bringing these characters into the medium of paint.\n\nIn an experience like no other, Loving Vincent takes the audience on a journey through his life and death, allowing us to step right into his artwork where we wonder about the meaning behind the scenes unveiling before our eyes.Loving Vincent\n\nArmand sets off in search of the truth and finds that sometimes, a man's fame is not made of what he set out to achieve during his lifetime but of the legacy that he leaves behind.\n\nDorota Kobiela had planned to combine her passion for painting and film, for her sixth animated short, and to paint the entire film herself. However, once she expanded Loving Vincent into a feature film the task of writing and directing was such that she had to content herself with directing the [124] painters. Although, Dorota managed to set some time aside to paint a few shots herself.\n\nAfter falling in love with Polish painter and director, Dorota Kobiela, Hugh Welchman also fell in love with her film project, Loving Vincent.  He has been working with her ever since.",

            "content": "- Art buff or not, you won't be able to help Loving Vincent -\n\nAlthough my first love was the performing arts, a few painters have always captured my imagination. Of those, the red-headed, Dutch, post-impressionist Vincent van Gogh was probably my favorite. I love his bright colors, his quirky portraits, his fields, flowers, and furniture. But above all, to nobody's surprise, I love his wild, dreamlike, and most famous \"Starry Night.\"\n\nThe Polish animated feature Loving Vincent is a bit like \"Starry Night.\" It's a simple premise: a young man is charged with delivering a letter from the recently dead Vincent to his brother Theo. It's quiet and soothing: the movie keeps at a pretty low pitch mostly, with lots of landscapes and scenes of people holding conversations. And yet, somehow, it's unlike anything you've ever seen: after the scenes were filmed and edited, a team of 100 artists oil-painted over every single frame.\n\nThe final product of such an endeavor? An epic exploration of the life, love, and death of Vincent Van Gogh through his own eyes, the way he looked at the world.\n\nLoving Vincent is not flashy, and wouldn't endear too much re-watching if it had merely been filmed and produced in the traditional way. But in its particular style of animation, the movie is not only able to give us a fresh way of humanizing this bizarre, legendary painter, but the filmmakers are able to bring dozens of his most beloved paintings to life.\n\nOur protagonist (Douglas Booth, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies; Noah) is Armand Roulin, of van Gogh's \"Yellow Jacket\" portrait. We also meet \"Marguerite Gachet at the Piano\" (Saoirse Ronan, Ladybird; Brooklyn)  the Postman Roulin (Chris O'Dowd, Molly's Game; The Incredible Jessica James, and the \"Old Man in Sorrow\" (Bill Thomas, Alice Through the Looking Glass). We glimpse the sunflowers, the irises, and the majestic stars shining over the Rhone.\n\nVincent van Gogh was, perhaps, a man born out of time. Depressed and poetic, quiet yet dramatic, living in poverty, and suffering from something like bipolar disorder or epilepsy, he remains a bittersweet hero for the modern artist. He is a reminder of the importance of human empathy and friendship. His story makes me humbly grateful for modern medicine and spurs me on to make the art that brings me joy, even if I never grow rich from my labors.\n\n\"What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?\"\n\nVincent wrote that phrase in a letter to his brother Theo. I like to think that sentiment inspired the directors (Dorota Kobiela, The Flying Machine; & Hugh Welchman, La Vie en Rose), oil painters, and crew of Loving Vincent. It certainly inspires me to take the leap to repaint my days with fresh new life of wonder and imagination.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/loving-vincent, and was written by Debbie Holloway.

Presenting Vincent van Gogh's life though a slow-paced murder mystery is an affective and brilliant way to present the story. The movie has a lot of dialogue and monologs in it, and the writing is absolutely fantastic, each character feels alive. Rotoscoping was used, all the scenes were acted out on a green screen, placed in a painting and over 100 painters painted the entire picture again, and as the first oil painted film, its quite simply genius. The soundtrack is also way more enjoyable then expected, I will have a listen to it later. Loving Vincent could so easily just have been a love letter to Vincent van Gogh, but it's so much more, it shows that great minds with a lot of passion can do anything, even if it takes 6-7 years to make.",

            "content": "LOVING VINCENT\n\nThe film is a gimmick of Linklater proportions, it's a feat as the first oil frame-by-frame painted movie. It's also a visually stunning film, expressive in its use of color and even \"lighting\", maintaining a tight relationship to the artist's technique and mood. Just like a Van Gogh, its details are less important than the overall expression, the latter relying almost uniquely on the former. Yet, a movie's greatness can't rest solely upon novelty, because if that was the case, The Jazz Singer and Avatar would be great films. In fact, seldom does first get to be best when you look back to the cinematic history. So, although Loving Vincent is certainly a courageous endeavour, we mustn't forget that it is highly flawed, as most experiments are when you test them for the first time. It's a highly frustrating movie, both for its script consisting of 100% of exposition and for its structure. For example, something bugged me in the first part of the film in which a flashback does not appear in black and white for no apparent  reason. I was fortunate enough to get the directors in the room to get my question asked but their answer did not justify its purpose at all. It is well regarded that there's strength in repetition so in order to make a cohesive point sometimes, when the execution wasn't perfect at first try, you have to hit the nail once again. The contrary is also true, as the movie utilizes the flashback mechanism so many times to point of it becomes wearisome, when a flashback seems almost gratuitous. When you are constantly alternating between present and past, it gives both insufficient importance, in a cycle of neglect. That was the main force of my frustration, as the movie kept repeating a part of film grammar that is strongest when used scarcely (or executed to perfection like in Citizen Kane). Ultimately, the movie's greatest flaw consists on avoiding what Van Gogh was filled to the brim with: the will to dare and to cut off a ear.",

The way that scenes blend into each other and how the dissolves into flashback drain the screen of almost all colour is just fantastic to behold. The story is engaging, if unremarkable, and the actors provide not only their voices but also their likeness, making it seem like their adventure is taking place on a living canvas. It might not receive the praise it so deserves, since CGI is king of the hill when it comes to animated pictures, but for those who like their movies modern but with a splash of classic, Loving Vincent is a show you won't soon forget.",

            "content": "All about the artistry.  A mystery of sorts, this is about a young man (Douglas Booth) who travels to the late Vincent van Gogh's hometown to deliver a letter.  While he is there, he tries to put together the puzzle pieces to determine what events led up to the artist's alleged suicide.  Now you may already be aware of the most noteworthy thing about this: every single frame of this film is fully painted from start to finish.  You just don't ever get to see that much effort put into animated films nowadays with the sole exception of stop-motion, and even then, those films are getting rarer and rarer.  It seems like a ton of extra work, but it is obviously appropriate given the subject matter at hand.  It is a pretty trippy effect when you first see it in motion, and it takes you a few minutes to adjust.  This movie is a work of art to be sure, but I really didn't dig the story at all.  I do feel like this is more of an experiment than anything else, and to pay this movie a compliment, the artwork is undeniably stunning.  There are different styles featured throughout, and they vary from scene to scene.  You can pause any single frame to this and people will likely think that it is a screensaver for your television, it is seriously that level of high detail.  If you can't afford the local art exhibition at the museum because it is too expensive, you might want to try putting this on as a cheaper alternative.  I love the look of this, but as previously stated, I never got into the story.  It builds van Gogh up to be this myth, but while it is about him, it is not really his story.  It's this other random guy's narrative, and it became very clear early on that they are just pulling a Rashomon here.  Everybody has their own version of the truth of events, and you never are 100% certain on what actually happened.  The story devolves into a lot of \"he said she said\", which I didn't care for.  The unreliable narrator is a storytelling device that I have seen before, and unfortunately, I've seen it done better and more interestingly.  I can't take anything away from the look of this film, and Loving Vincent will at least be remembered as being the first to attempt something of this nature.  Given that it is a Rashomon style story, there are a ton of flashbacks, and I felt that it got in the way of the forward movement of the plot, but that might just be me.  As it stands, this is a beautiful movie that I never connected with, which is a shame, because I was really excited for it, given everything I heard about the production.",

This film is the first fully painted animated feature film, and unfortunately, that is the one thing going for this film. Every scene is so beautiful, every brush stroke. There are black and white flashback scenes that are so realistically painted, for a brief moment I actually forgot I was watching a painted film. The way the backgrounds are emphasized in any given scene, second by second, how the clouds moved across the sky. How a river would flow, the wind blowing leaves down the road, or even the change of sunlight shown on a character's clothing. Subtle moments such as these really make this film stand out. Each of the film's 65,000 frames is an oil painting on canvas, using the same technique as van Gogh, created by a team of 125 amazing painters.\n\nIt would be unfair for me to only praise this very unique animation style-despite that it deserves every bit of praise-and touch on nothing else. The story is a murder mystery, taking place one year after Vincent van Gogh's death, diving deep into whether the death was the result of a suicide or a possible murder. You may be mesmerized by the amazing visuals, but once you begin paying attention to the story, it may immediately take you out. The script isn't great, which draws away from what you are seeing on the screen. The story touches very briefly on van Gogh's life, relationship with his brother, and the mutilation of his ear. It leaves much desired when those aspects are so much more interesting within this story, than the issue at hand.\nAbsolutely amazing cast, but even here lies a problem. Taking place in France, the entire cast consists of English and Irish actors; their accents are so noticeable, their voices alone are enough to pull you out of a scene. Saoirse Ronan and Chris O'Dowd, two Irish actors I adore, and I had the hardest time feeling any legitimacy in their French characters with such hard Irish accents. The same goes for Jerome Flynn and Helen McCrory, two stellar English actors, but portraying French characters their accents took me right out of their scenes. Now this may not affect other people seeing this film, but it was extremely noticeable for me and quite jarring. I can't help but wonder if the film would have been done better justice by keeping it a short film.",

Three-dimensional movies were the talk of the town about 10-15 years ago and have now become an annoyance to many. Loving Vincent is the newest film to try something new in terms of how it tells its story. Being completely painted by hand, this movie moves along as if it had been animated about 60 years ago. A more recent comparison would be to say it looks like A Scanner Darkly, but I truly feel this film's much more unique than even that. This is a wonderfully engaging premise and even without that aspect, here's why I believe everyone needs to see this film, even just based on the portraits alone.\n\nLoving Vincent tells the story of Armand, a young man who has been tasked with the devastating venture of delivering Vincent Van Gogh's final letter. Upon arrival of the town that Van Gogh ultimately met his untimely end, Armand finds himself incredibly interested in the mystery surrounding this death. Becoming more of an investigation film than a simple journey, Loving Vincent takes you on a ride that's full of insight and powerful moments between characters. I didn't think I would've been so moved by this movie, but the performances/voiceover work was truly astounding, sucking me right into this beautiful portrait of a film.\n\nIt's one thing to commend this film for having truly breathtaking visuals, but that's also the understatement of the year. This movie blows away any animated film from last year in terms of being uniquely made. From the nods to Van Gogh's classic works, to the motion and dissolves between scenes, everything about this film felt seamless. That being said, there's a large obstacle that many viewers will have to get over as soon as the film begins as well, being the fact that it's entirely painted by hand. This wonderful aspect of the movie will definitely be off-putting to some, due to the fact that it's the first film of its kind and may be bizarre to look at. For myself, I found it absolutely fascinating, plain and simple.\n\nAs someone who prefers other forms of art than paintings, I do admire a great piece of art, regardless of the medium. This movie explores a life that pretty much everyone has heard of at some point in time, and I must admit, I didn't know this story was as complex of a mystery as this movie suggests it is. From motivational speeches about life and the universe to questions brought up in a philosophical way, I was incredibly immersed in each and every one of the scenes throughout this film. There's hardly any downtime because every line of dialogue progresses this story forward at a rapid rate.\n\nIn the end, Loving Vincent may not be for everyone, especially due to its unique look, but the story itself is something I believe everyone needs to see. There is a scene that closes out the movie that I still have playing over and over in my head. As I mentioned many times, this movie is filled with memorable lines of dialogue that truly makes you think about life itself and the universe surrounding us. This may seem biased and this particular reaction will surely not hit everyone the way it hit me, but I found this to be a remarkable picture. I fear this movie will go fairly unnoticed, which is a shame because literally, every aspect of this film is wondrous to behold. This is one of my favorite films of 2017.",

Yes it is gorgeous and a total tour-de-force of stylized animation - a must-see for anyone who has appreciated the energy and acuity of Van Gogh. But... the simplicity with which the narrative is carried out by means of \"moving through\" Van Gogh's works is done with a humanistic and psychologically structured approach that mirrors his works.  These are relationships and haunts drawn from his final days, and they are woven into the visual fabric of the film/canvases in front of you. All in all, it yields tremendous balance to the whole effort, and is an accomplishment as sensitive as these visual treasures he left us. I'm not sure what additional narrative these critics are looking for?",

They could have easily used the live action reference footage and painted the people as Van Gogh did. Also take the beginning scene. Van Gogh painted in a broken/warped perspective style for a reason, the film nails it at first but then relies on reference footage and goes back to realistic correct perspective. If this had been a James Cameron production, like Titanic, he would have made sure every single detail was just as Van Gogh had intended. This isn't the Van Gogh I've grown up loving my whole life. And then their is the black and white footage... It feels like they were running out of time and used it as a cut corner filler. \n\nOverall this is a fair and noble attempt and was a good idea.

            "content": "A visual tour de force, this is a projection of Van Gogh's art by the 100 or more artists who painted every scene. It is rich with animations of the real-life actors, who are painted convincingly in the Van Gogh style, using scenes based on his actual and famous paintings, which spring astonishingly to life as the action arises.  Alternating with the Van Gogh pictures are biographical flashbacks, which are painted or drawn in black and white photo-realism, again of a very high artistic quality.  The story involves an inquiry into the circumstances of Van Gogh's death. In this, it is less satisfying dramatically, with loose ends, not grasping the nettle, and stopping short of an accusation of mortal envy.  The Gachet interview scene seems too easy and forgiving. The alternative explanation of the fatal gunshot, a mischief by an errant youth, also lacks reality because the inquisitor never questions the (then) boy. The film apologises for the failure of those around Van Gogh to save him.  This show is in no way humorous, yet it is recalls The Life of Brian, where Brian's followers parade by, complimenting him for sacrificing himself, instead of rescuing him. Here, the film dwells on Van Gogh's forgiveness of the unforgivable - \"don't blame anyone\" he is reported to have said, as he lay dying needlessly of an untreated gunshot wound, while several characters come by to see him.  The film produces evidence that he was not suicidal, and that suicide was unlikely in the circumstances, and then it goes soft. The critical point about Van Gogh's art is his reach into the condition of the poor, farm workers, women and the hard struggle of life, and into nature.  He related most easily with and lived among working people and peasants: in that sense he was a traitor to his class. To combine these sentiments with his artistic power must have driven his well to do friends to distraction, particularly those who wished they could paint. If as it seems Van Gogh also won the heart of a bourgeois woman, half his age, the resentment he inspired must have run deep. The film dips its toes into this unpalatable water, and then weakens, in favour of vague philosophising - was it just Vincent just being Vincent, and did it really matter whether he committed suicide or was killed.  Really? Van Gogh's paintings were both sophisticated and fearless; he had enormous generosity of spirit. This film is loving compliance more than it is loving Vincent, and in the end it leaves him to the wolves.",

A concept unheard of, and a story that makes for a fascinating and beautifully artistic biopic worthy of Vincent Van Gogh, with many images and scenes calling back to his most famous works.  The visuals are so seamless it is easy to forget that everything you're seeing has been painted.  For any fan of animation, for any film buff, for anyone who loves the work of Vincent Van Gogh and great painting, see this film.",

It seems easy to label someone as something and to move on in life, to cast judgement on those we see as different, yet this film reminds me that there is more to a person than just what I see with my own two eyes.

The film took over two years to make utilizing the skills of 125 professional artists who painted nearly a thousand canvases to create the 6,500 frames that comprise Loving Vincent, the first fully hand painted animated feature film. Loving Vincent takes place a year after the death of Vincent Van Gogh (Robert Gulaczyk.) Vincent\u0092s good friend Postmaster Roulin (Chris O\u0092Dowd) asks his son Armand (Douglas Booth) to hand deliver Van Gogh\u0092s last letter to his brother Theo. Armand reluctantly accepts the task & begins a complicated & mysterious journey. After visiting Pere Tanguy (John Sessions) who tells Armand that Theo died shortly after hearing of his brother\u0092s death, Armand heads to Auvers-sur-Olse to the home of Dr. Gachet (Jerome Flynn) who took care Vincent after his release from the asylum. While waiting to see Dr. Gachet, Armand begins conversations with a variety of people who had some interaction with Van Gogh prior to his death ; Adeline Ravoux (Eleanor Tomlinson), the temporary proprietress of the local inn where Vincent was staying, Dr. Gachet\u0091 s housekeeper, Louise Chevalier (Helen McCrory), Dr. Gachet\u0092s sheltered daughter Marguerite (Saoirse Ronan), & local boatman (Adan Turner). As each person reveals their version of the events leading up to Vincent\u0092s leading death, Armand begins to question whether Vincent really committed suicide or was murdered. Loving Vincent is directed by the husband & wife team of Dorota Kobiela & Hugh Welchman who co-wrote the screenplay with Jacek Dehnel. They have created a uniquely beautiful tribute to the heartbreaking & compelling story of a true genius\u0092s brief but prolific life. The oil painted animation was stunning with each scene painted in Van Gogh\u0092s signature style. The performances from cast, who performed in front of a green screen, were captivating. Loving Vincent is a film for those who are fans of amazing art & powerful film. MUST-SEE FILM.",

I was able to view this film at a small theater in Chicago called the Music Box Theater. It was like an old classic film theater with projectors that projected film. It was a really cool experience and honestly, it made watching this film even more fun.\n\n\"Loving Vincent\" is certainly an inventive film, and definitely one of its own kind. It takes advantage of multiple aspects used in film. It's like a combination between animation and stop-motion story-telling, however, it's told entirely through oil drawing paintings. I mean, how fucking cool is that? If that doesn't interest you as a filmmaker or as a fan, then I don't know what will. Every scene in this movie was painted over hand by hand, and it looked absolutely beautiful. Over 100 painters were used during the production, and it certainly came out beautifully. \n\nThe way the paintings were captured looked really good. It really did look like everything was in constant motion. What I think they did was they painted layers over and over the base painting, which gave they illusion of the painting moving as the filmmakers snapshotted each frame. It can be a little weird to look at at first, as your eyes have to adjust to unique movement that the frames display, but you quickly adjust and it becomes so worth it.\n\nThe sound design was also something that was very crucial and beneficial to this sound. I wouldn't say that the score or the sound effects were completely out of this world, but they added so much to something that is 2D. They brought life and realism to these gorgeous paintings and it made it feel so real. At times, it looked like these scenes were real, as it looked that spectacular. The sound design and editing team really put a lot into this film, making the experience even more memorable. \n\nWhat I didn't like about this film, which was actually a big negative, was the story itself. No, I'm not saying Van Gogh's story is uninteresting, because it certainly isn't. But the story is just the main character walking around for an hour and a half, having conversations about what really happened with Van Gogh. The movie really was all narrative, and they missed a huge opportunity by not telling the movie with the imagery. The imagery was such a huge part, but I couldn't find myself attached to the story because it was told in a very mundane way. \n\nIn the end, \"Loving Vincent\" was a very solid film and one that had a really unique take on it. I would certainly watch this film just to experience the innovative story-telling, even if it's not the strongest film as a whole.",

Every shot shimmers as the scenes transform from a static view of one of Van Gogh's paintings to a more conventional \"camera\" image, albeit painted in V.G. style. It reminded me a little of the Monty Python animated shorts with famous paintings.

Its almost psychedelic with the way the images move and blend the colors.  Sometimes the characters seem real at times.   All of the visuals mimic Van Gough's impressionistic style and the characters are taken from his paintings using actors with some sort of animation filter.  I have never seen anything like this and enjoyed it.  The point of the movies is to tell the story primarily about Van Gough's latter years and suggests an interesting alternative to the circumstances of his death and sheds light on and questions the extent of his mental illness.   The whole story and how and who tells it is very clever and captivating.  I highly recommend this movie.",

            "content": "There's two immediate challenges I see when thinking about a film like this, and it has to mentioned, this is the first film of it kind. The first handed animated picture that actually captures the actors performances and not just their voice talents. Firstly is how on Earth do you make a film that's not only painted, but is done entirely in the style of their chosen artist which leads me to their second challenge; how does one (or two) tell a story about Vincent Van Gogh? \n\nI was fortunate enough to catch a Q&A screening for it's UK/ROI premiere which was hosted by London's own National Gallery; and I am so glad I did with answers being provided by Hugh Welchman, one half of the husband and wife team who directed the picture, one of the producers, Ivan Mactaggart, actors, Douglas Booth and Helen McCory; and one of the many artists that worked on the film, Sarah Wimperis. All of which gave a deeper understanding and a growing appreciation of this astounding film. \n\nWhat do we know about Van Gogh? Or what do we think we know about the troubled artist? He's considered the father of modern and western art, he cut his own ear off after what some suspect to be during a binge on absinthe. We all know many of his famous paintings of landscapes, portraits and self portraits, whether we recognise them to by him or not. \n\nSo how do they successful tell an interesting story of the artist that would appeal to the masses without becoming a documentary? Well, there's a brilliant narrative choosing to tell part of his story from after his supposed suicide turning this into an intriguing murder mystery that isn't a far-fetched story. It's been in constant debate among biographers, art historians and even the Van Gogh Museum regarding his supposed suicide, which leads this story down an open mystery.  \n\nMuch of the story is based on an immense amount of research as see through the story of Armand Roulin, one of Van Gogh subjects who reluctantly goes to Paris to deliver a letter to Van Gogh's brother, Theo; but he inadvertently unearths suspicion when he hears opposing stories from the people who knew Van Gogh. These parts being taken directly from the conflicting statements written after his death. \n\nDouglas Booth leads an incredible cast, playing Armand Roulin, who is amazing and is fast becoming one of my favourite actors, having seen him in The Limehouse Golem earlier this summer. I don't know what it is about him, but I honestly believe he would make an incredible Freddie Mercury. There's a strong supporting cast, all of whom had to model their respective character's pose from their portraits, and all give great performances that really adds another dimension to the animation. \n\nThe animation itself is a totally separate feat all together, never having seen anything like it. Some might suspect the technique of rotoscoping being used but the film is entirely hand painted and uses stop-motion animation. This was achieved with the incredible collaboration of some 120 different artists and painters who worked endlessly for over 2 years. Now these artists are not animators, so not only did they have to learn to understand animation they had to unlearn their own style and adopt Van Gogh's in so to bring his paintings to life. \n\nSo many of his works are used with his landscape pieces setting the scenes such as his 'Yellow House', 'The Night Caf\u00e9' and 'The Church at Auvers' whereas his portraits are used to introduce each character of the story, each being real life people he had met and painted. Sarah Wimperis, one the artists who worked on the film spent 5 months painting the wheat fields, around 300 frames worth that equated to about 30 seconds of screen time. The total project resulting in some 65,000 paintings ending up with around 900 canvases which some had been sold to help finance the film, some gifted to cast and crew and the rest currently being auctioned off. \n\nIt's spectacularly unique and stunningly vivid using Van Gogh colour palette throughout apart from the gorgeous black and white sequences which depicted times before his death with the vibrant colourful scenes representing the present narrative. The film's ratio is also respectful of Van Gogh, using the academy ratio which is the closest format to the canvases he would have painted on. \n\nAll of this accompanied by an impressive and alluring score from Clint Mansell, a composer the makers originally wanted and who at first refused. The studio had used a playlist of Mansell's previous pieces to help inspire the film creation. Glady Mansell changed his mind last minute and agreed to work on the project composing thrilling and enchanting tracks that are titled and inspired by Van Gogh famous pieces. Lianne La Havas does an amazing rendition of Don McLean's 'Vincent' to boot. \n\nOverall, this is the most ambitious film I have seen this year, and one of the ambitious films of all time that has created a masterpiece, a perfect amalgamation of stunning artistry and enthralling storytelling that's both educational and inspirational. I would be very excited to see other artists life's work portrayed in such a creative and visually brilliant way. Did I hear right that Gogos would be an idea? \n\nRunning Time: 9\nThe Cast: 8\nPerformance: 8\nDirection: 10\nStory: 10\nScript: 10\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 10\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being an unique, visual masterpiece that melds perfectly with great storytelling. \n\n95% 10/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

As to the story, I couldn't help but wonder why, after the directors saw their first tests come to life, that they didn't take a different approach to the story. Sadly, far too absent from the narrative is the artist himself. Since his paintings are the way that Vincent saw the world around himself, tackling that approach would have seemed a better story than what the director's chose. The most touching part of the film was the closing credits. So much love and care went into this film however, that its story line is easily forgiven.

Even with authentic settings and a cast of colourful character both figuratively and literally, the film is a hugely investing and outstandingly beautiful film to see, almost verging from the very dramatic plotting to the eye catching surrealist aspect of the art-house sphere this film is fixed within. While it's hard to determine whether or not the mystery of the late painter's death can be explained, especially alongside the historical accuracy aspect of this film, everything else about it from the initial premise alone is enough to recommend to all audiences young and old to experience even well before you could say 'Oscar for Best Animated Film' since the oil work paintings are it's signature look while the feel comes from the technical and written aspects alone. I wish I could give this my perfect grade though something inside me is doubting it figuratively especially along the lines of historical accuracy and overall sustenance.",

Positively mindblowing in its conception. Every frame was hand painted beautifully by very skilful artists over a period of two years. I believe the entire film took about seven years in all to complete. The resulting animation looks like a moving work of art. The oil paints seem to glide effortlessly over the subject matter creating scene after scene. It truly is a feast for the eyes. The story elaborates on the events leading up to and after Van Gogh's untimely death. His demise is still shrouded in a great deal of mystery. Some say he killed himself while others are adamant that he was murdered but chose to protect the killer's identity in his dying moments. It's surprisingly engaging as a detective story and really adds to the whole experience. Wonderful work by everyone involved in creating this from the artists to the cast to the producers.

However, after learning of Theo's death, he begins investigating the small town of Auvers where Vincent passed away, and learns that the circumstances surrounding Vincent's death are suspicious. Of course, the whole film is such a unique way of storytelling, probably the most unique I've ever seen, as it is ALL oil-painted, and it goes without saying the visuals are incredible. Each frame is beautifully drawn, and sewn together very well by good editing. The film's plot is told through flashbacks, as Rolan goes around Auvers asking many people questions about Vincent, and (thank God) the flashbacks are good. They don't bore you/disengage you from the story, and the change of colour scheme in the flashbacks draws your attention even more to the screen you're viewing them on.Also, there is a small subplot in the story that develops the character of Armand Rolan very nicely, and this plotline aids and abets the main detective/investigatory plotline, making the viewing all the more enjoyable. I think people won't like this film purely because of the animation style, because it does take a little bit of time to get used to (only a couple of minutes), but because it is so out there, I think it'll draw people away from watching it. Also, the change of accents from what they would've been might make some people disconnect from the film, because all accents are English, and if I'm honest I'm not sure they worked, and I think I'd have preferred the authentic accents.",

Van Gogh, who painted over 800 works of art in his short life (and sold only 1while he was alive) is an intriguing subject and the filmmakers waste no time or footage in exploring his complicated and troubled life.

Armand travels around Europe in search of relatives or closer people he could deliver his father's farewell letter to, but finds the mystery surrounding Gogh's death and the deceiving locals to be of higher priority. Douglas Booth is absolutely fantastic as Armand, whom I have never seen before but will love to see more from now on. From the second he appears on the screen all the way to the end of the film, he is a strong, charismatic and relatable presence that audience easily sympathizes with as he is young and arrogant, but reasonably so as he is far more interested at succeeding at his own life rather than go looking for answers for someone else's death, the peer pressure he feels from relatives can be understood by even the youngest members in the audience. The supporting cast is excellent as well, with Saoirse Ronan standing out as Madame Gachet, the wife of Doctor Gachet(played equally well by Jerome Flynn) who appears mean and mysterious from the first page of her carefully drawn canvas pictures. The whodunit plot is easy to follow, and the wealth of flashbacks and backstories provided by the colorful characters Armand comes across are emotionally punctual and enthralling, with complementary editing that keeps the pace brisk, yet adventurous, slow but deliberately so, that along with Clint Mansell's(Ghost in the Shell, Black Swan) is beautiful, haunting and compelling, he's certainly a composer to watch out for.The artwork, or rather the visual style I was referring to has been hand drawn by over 120 artists, painting over 60000 paintings on canvases, with the intended purpose to recreate both the style of Van Gogh's paintings and capture the visual appearance of the actors in a way that doesn't feel too realistic but not otherworldly either, somewhere in between would be the correct phrasing. The film is absolutely beautiful, the cinematography is excellent, as it draws on many of Gogh's famous works, translates them onto the screen, incorporates them into the narrative, in a way that makes his paintings quite literally come to life or gain new meaning, a new life. It's rare that a film with so much style and such simple premise manages to be so enhancing, I found the style of the film to be more than just good-looking, but also fitting and poignant, as the story gets darker and Gogh is made out by characters to NOT to be the angel we'd think he'd have been by simply looking at his work, the style of the film reminds us once again that there was beauty to his madness and his pain, adding all the more weight to the story as we're even more intrigued by what would've led a person this talented to draw himself an end so tragic. In an age where films are dominated by CGI, deterring audiences and pulling them out of the film's established reality, \"Loving Vincent\" does the complete opposite, it draws them further in and doesn't let go for the entirety of its runtime, furthermore it talks about life and influence and how people tend to look at the aspects of someone's life that may not be as important as the things they've left behind and the things that they could've left behind if said aspects of his/her life wouldn't have been caused by people who should've loved him.\"Loving Vincent\" is a powerful piece of cinema, with strong performances from a talented cast, each and every frame feels like it has a purpose, to excite, scare, enrich and educate people on the work of a master, and by being so successful at it, the films becomes something of a masterpiece of its own, one whose basic premise you start to overlook as you realize how much it has moved you, by utilizing all aspects of film making, by being genuinely creative and unique and very much so daring, just like the person it's based upon.",

You should watch this movie.  Why? Because it is sort of thing that in the first place makes people want to explore escapists panels of an artwork. It is the sort of thing that not only is bearer of a tale of reality that is embellished in places for the better but also the courageous sort and innovative workmanship that inspires people to do better. And if you think I am being overzealous in my praise of this movie, then let me remind of the hard work that was put into making 65000 frames of oil painting that were used to make this animated motion picture. It does not rest in its laurels aforementioned which surely are being already recorded in some or other panels of history, it produces passionate acting from a caring cast who fill and fit in well in their roles telling the tale of a man who lived with internal turmoil in life than the fame and recognition his art brought him in death.As far as arguments about his repetitive and not enough display of the titular character goes, I implore people to gather patience, be calm and revisit their words and possibly watching the movie itself. It is a posthumous journey of finding the truth of a perceived reality and while it does take time to get the bottom of things, it doesn't dally and neither do its protagonist seem bland. Also, while Van Gogh is shown infrequently, it is meaningful to his arc and every moments of this narrative is dedicated to him. To a Man who drew 800 pieces f art in 8 years, To a Man who was so troubled and so lonely, To a Man whose story changed the heart of another man unwilling and To a Man who left memories - for better or worse - in his wake for a lifetimes to come.If you still don't think this is worth your time, well good luck to further endeavors which I hope may bring you almost as much joy as this story did for me. And if you ever see anyone who was involved in this movie and its making, call them out and give them a congratulatory hug recognizing their contribution and dedications. Viva La Van Gogh!",

Loving Vincent is landmark event for animation and even biographical storytelling through its majestic vision at the last days of Vincent Van Gogh.Set a after the death of fabled painter, Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) is possessed with a letter from Van Gogh to his brother Theo before his death, and begins the journey to deliver it. While on call, Roulin encounters all the people close to Vincent before is death gradually trying to put the pieces of what cause his sudden suicide. From this we are taken back to key moments of Van Gogh's life mesmerizingly displayed through the living oil paintings.Generated by 65,000 paintings by over a 100 artist, Loving Vincent is living work of art. First shot as a live action depiction then adapted into paintings, the immersive gallery of scenes is a first in new format of animation. Directors: Dorota Kobiela, and Hugh Welchman take Van Gogh's own artistry into his own biography (almost), from Citizen Kane style narrative, assessing and celebrating the life of one of the worlds if not the most famous painter. From this production becomes transporting cinema experience into the world of Van Gogh and an enchanting watch of magnificent painting and animation.Of course what is the fundamental strength of Loving Vincent is its captivating artwork which for every moment is spectacular, and then you have the real narrative of Van Gogh's last days which on its own is an affectionate journey. Even if you don't not much about the life of Van Gogh this is an enthralling experience.The monumental presence of the paintings is consistently exceptional with wonderful detail and creation put into it. One of the sensational efforts for the film is its sketch of the real actors, making them instantly recognisable on screen, bringing their performance into the art. Although our eyes are set on visual presence, Clint Mansell's score is also a tear-jerking atmosphere throughout the film, capturing the melancholy as well as joy of Van Gogh.Loving Vincent is a visual sensation, proving the amazing talent that animation brings to the screen. This is by far one of the most significant films of the year and is must see experience, especially for art students.",

But what is trulyHere stands a film perhaps as oddly remarkable as the great artist whose demise it documents; Loving Vincent is a Polish-UK co-production charting the final days (and the shady aftermath of which) of Vincent Van Gogh. But what is truly extraordinary about this film is that it is the first animated film created entirely with oil paints, in the notable style of its eponymous painter. Loving Vincent is an ambitious visual experiment, every frame avowedly hand-painted in a pastiche of Van Gogh\u2019s work. It\u2019s an experiment that certainly works; landscapes swirl dreamily across the screens and oozing strokes of paint litter the faces of the film\u2019s players. There is something strangely ethereal about the animation; it\u2019s utterly immersive and beautiful and surely can be appreciated simply for its flair and the pain-staking commitment required to create it. The film was also shot in live-action beforehand; we see Chris O\u2019Dowd, Saoirse Ronan and the rest of the cast embodied within the brushstrokes, in a strangely satisfying and delightfully expressive way. There\u2019s an effortlessness and innovation to the film\u2019s design; the same cannot be said, however, of its plot.Though not unenjoyable, Loving Vincent\u2019s plot is rather thin, comprised of exposition-packed flashbacks and uninspired dialogue. Over-narrated and over-simplified, it never really takes flight or makes much of an impact, despite numerous attempts. We watch as young Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) seeks to deliver a letter, at the request of his father, from a deceased Vincent to his brother, only to become hooked in finding out the truth behind the artist\u2019s death among the witnesses of his final days. The cast, led by Booth, are lively enough, but are not enough to distract one from a flimsy narrative that begins to feel like a tame episode of Poirot. Despite this, the film is entertaining enough and it\u2019s clear that the true intentions of directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman is to impress via the film\u2019s visuals rather than its story.Loving Vincent is a definite mixed bag of a film; visually, it\u2019s exquisite and never excessively dull, but its formulaic and uninspired plot cannot be ignored. For a movie that claims to be a biopic of Vincent Van Gogh, it tells us very little about the man itself, functioning far more as a standard who-dunnit that is gorgeous to watch but, on occasion, feels self-admiring. An interesting film that is worth watching just for its pure style.",

The weak point of this movie is basically everything except the beautiful and unbelievable animation.The Good:-Without a doubt, the best of this movie is the animation. Every single frame is incredible, it's a love letter to Vincent Van Gogh as the visual style is based on Van Gogh's paintings and some scenes of the movie are direct references to some of his most iconic works of art. I'm impressed of the effort from all of the animators to make this movie a moving painting.I would actually watch this movie again just to admire the animation.-I think the acting was solid for the most part.The Bad:-The script and story. This is basically some sort of \"crime investigation\" film, as the focus of the movie is the investigation of the true causes of Van Gogh's death. That's obviously not the problem, the problem is that it's a very repetitive movie. There's one scene of someone talking to another person, then that person talks about something he knew about Van Gogh in a flashback, and then that someone walks and talks to another person, that other person talks about Van Gogh in a flashback again and so on. By the fourth time this happened I was like \"Oh, not again\". And that's the major problem.-Because of the repetitive story structure, there's no character development and it results in an overall forgettable movie.I would obviously recommend this movie if you're interested in animation or you're an animation student as this is just an amazing movie visually speaking. But if you're not interested in animated movies...Well, I think I can't really recommend it.I give it a 7/10 because the animation gives it tons of extra points, if this was a standard live action movie, then I would've give it a red score.",

And I speak about visuals in general because this is a short way to mean that lighting is wonderful, details are omnipresent, movements are gorgeous and colours are meaningful. Those artists have successfully recreated some of the major Van Gogh's paintings and managed to have them included impressively in the movie.Despite these points 'Loving Vincent' also could have been way different and maybe so much better than what it actually is. Only speaking about the scenario, all this project does is to add flashbacks to flashbacks to try to solve a passed potential crime. Why does this have to be so close to the investigation and crime category of movies? This totally ruins the thing! You could have made it so much more biographical, closer to Van Gogh's daily life. All we hear about him comes from people speaking about him: 'I heard this...', 'I saw that...', ... And the movie underlines the fact that everyone has a different opinion about Van Gogh and the events of his death.The end especially could have been so much better. The last thing we see and hear is the opinion of Dr. Gachet, the main doctor of Van Gogh. And the movie ends in a certain way that we want to believe this last testimony. However it is just another opinion and we had a lot of them during the feauture. So for me this is totally an open ending that tries to erase a lot of what we saw before. The conclusion is so easy: 'he killed himself in a weird way because he was totally crazy'. And after all we have been through it is such a lame conclusion! A few inconsistencies in the movie doesn't match at all with this end.So I want the end of this review to be far more mixed than the movie end. I think as I said that this movie is incredible by the way it has been produced and the way it looks. But I found that the stroytelling appears to be really poor to me. A lot of characters are badly introduced or unintelligible (as the simple dummy boy at the end). Not bad but could have easily been better.",

I found the various characters intriguing and I found it a very watchable film. I believe it took many years to make, due to the traditional paint based animation and it shows. I felt like I could see the emotion in the various characters eyes, with hints of teardrops appearing in the corners of their eyes and the like.I am quite a big fan of animation, have always been since a child, so this film had appealed to me for a long time and I honestly can't say it disappointed. I was both interested to see it in terms of the painting work used to create it but also in terms of being interested in the story of the troubled person who was Vincent Van Gogh and this film certainly taught me more about him. I was aware of his time spent in Arles, in France, having visited the area a few summers ago and this place features in the film, so I found it very interesting, with good voice work from the cast, including Josh Burdett, Holly Earl, John Sessions, Helen McCrory and Chris O'Dowd.Even if your not especially keen on Van Gogh, I would still recommend it as a different type of film from 'regular' CGI based animation or the like. However, I should probably point out that this is rated 12 in the UK due to the theme of mental illness being inevitably present but also there was a scene depicting a prostitute with a customer and the infamous gifting of Vincents cut ear is also depicted, so I wouldn't recommend it be shown to pre-teens certainly.",
