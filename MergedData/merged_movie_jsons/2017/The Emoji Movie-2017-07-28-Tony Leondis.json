            "content": "'The Emoji Movie\" is a new children's film. One of the posters for it has a picture of whipped poop on the front of it. Was there a focus group done that says kids really want this? This masterpiece takes place inside of some kid's i-phone in a place called Textopolis. Gene is a Meh emoji who just wants to cut loose and show a whole range of emotions, which apparently counts as a malfunction and gets him scheduled for deletion. Now before you think i'm just going to crap on this movie, know that it is kind of fun for a certain age. These killer robots chase Gene and two of his buddies around which always keeps things fast-paced, there's all sorts of promotional tie-ins with Candy Crush, Instagram, and Spotify that while cheap product placement, also are kinda funny and exciting.Like all kids movies nowadays with fairly weak scripts, there's also a soundtrack filled with dance songs that should have kids dancing in the aisles, and guess what, it's not just stuff from your kids generation but some from yours too. Take the stuff that's for you where you can cause a lot of the jokes are either literal bores (Internet trolls are trolls, etc.) or center a lot on cartoons having overly cartoony personalities. There's an overly smiley emoji who borders on the psychotic, joyless Meh emojis. This stuff is kinda funny, but the joke is thin. Then there's the stuff you should expect already going in. Like the jokes centered on the poop emoji, or the Hi-Five emoji saying \"talk to the hand.\" Does anyone say this anymore? It's amazing this movie was co-written by Mike White, writer of \"School of Rock\" and Jennifer Aniston's \"The Good Girl\". It's sporadically funny and you can tell it's trying be a kind of \"Wreck It-Ralph\" meets \"Inside Out\" but it's not really inventive enough to be either. The kid whose phone this is never really becomes much of a character and probably the funniest part of this movie is that among a plethora of other scattered and unsubtle messages about including everyone and real friends are better than online ones, this also comes with a message of \"be yourself\" told primarily through emojis who want to be more than themselves. Lastly, and for the love of God I hope this was meant as a joke, there are scenes where the emoji is given way too much credit in the scope of love and life in this film. If this is true then it really does go all the way down from here folks. But that's \"The Emoji Movie\" in a nutshell. You'll laugh in parts, wanna reach over and tell your kids movies used to be so much better than this in others, and finally, just want to weep for the future.If you liked this, please check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.",

            "review_title": "An \"emoji\" disaster that is closer to \"poop\" than it is to \"meh\"",
            "content": "Saw 'The Emoji Movie' as a big fan of animation, to see whether the concept (which was one that was hard to decide whether it was intriguing or baffling) would work, as someone who has liked the previous work of a lot of the voice actors (i.e. Patrick Stewart) and whether it was as bad as the tsunami of negative publicity before release and when it came out made it out to be.After seeing it, there are worse films out there (animated and otherwise) but 'The Emoji Movie' is a mess, if not quite the recipe/incarnate for cancer that has been described. Regarding the target audience from personal experience (this doesn't mean that it will apply to all audiences or everybody's experiences), 'The Emoji Movie' didn't appeal to either children or adults in my cinema screening. Adults were squirming their way throughout the film and while recognising the things that are referenced were groaning and rolling their eyes at how everything was executed. Children looked like a lot of the ideas were going over their heads and seemed more interested in their bags of sweets and popcorn than what was going on on screen. It was a mix of both with me.The best, or shall we say the least bad, thing about 'The Emoji Movie' is the voice cast. Most of the voice actors gave decent performances (James Corden and Patrick Stewart are the liveliest of the bunch), though a few didn't fit their characters (Maya Rudolph has shown that she can voice act with a lot of bubbly personality but she was just wrong here). They did deserve much better however, and should have known much better, didn't think that Stewart could lose more dignity but he managed it in a embarrassingly misconceived character that he gave much more to than deserved.Everything else comes off badly or worse. There are worse-looking animated films, but the animation never rises above routine, often looking flat and stiff and there is a complete lack of imagination, the colours never popping out at you as they ought like they do from personal experience with \"emojis\". The soundtrack is all noise and no subtlety, and tends to be inappropriate.When it comes to the writing and the story, 'The Emoji Movie' fails. And not just by a little. We are talking hardcore. All the jokes fall flat because of how randomly they tend to be executed and the jokes in quality are juvenile at best and infantile at worst. The script is peppered with dialogue that is overripe and will embarrass even the youngest of cinema goers, when it's not going over their heads. The story, proof that the concept was more of a questionable one than a good one, is not much of one and feels like it was made up as it went along, with the insertion of the likes of Candy Crush, Spotify, Youtube and Facebook being little more than blatant product plugs explored in a mostly throwaway fashion. There are a lot of random and unnecessary scenes and even more so facepalm-worthy moments.Imagination is zero here, with a mishmash of ideas reminiscent of 'Inside Out', 'Wreck It Ralph' and 'The Lego Movie', all three actually being good films (masterpieces in the case of the first two), but without the fun, creativity or emotional investment which are as non-existent as the imagination. The basic theme is a relatable one when done right, but dealt with indifferently. The characters are both bland and annoying, character development is minimal and what there is is rushed.Overall, a mess. While it is a little better than made out, there is the agreement that the film is a disaster that is more poop than it is meh, despite being the general consensus it seems that this review is not going to be popular when it comes to useful votes. Despite being a subjective person, the excessive non-useful votes for the negative reviews and the up-voting of the positive ones are a little suspicious to me. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "What Makes the Emoji Movie so Bad?",
            "content": "I tried. I really did. I went in with an open mind. \"This could still be like The Lego Movie,\" I told myself. \"Just give it a chance.\" Turns out we were right all along.The Emoji Movie, from Sony Pictures Animation, was written and directed by Anthony Leondis. Eric Siegel and Mike White joined as co-writers. To these men I ask, what compelled you to birth this? The Emoji Movie is a grating movie. It gives us characters flatter than actual emojis, and replaces world-building with ads!The movie opens at a schoolyard where human teenager, Alex (Jake T. Austin), receives a text from a girl he has a crush on. As he tries to formulate a reply, we zoom in to his phone to see the city of Textopolis. In this world, each emoji has to be their one \"thing\" their whole life. Crying emojis need to always be sad, laughing emojis need to always be happy, and so on. We're then introduced to Gene, voiced by T.J. Miller, who's supposed to be a \"Meh\" emoji. The problem is, he doesn't seem able to control his expressions, and his first day on the job he messes up everything. The head of the texting department, Smiler (Maya Rudolph), holds a meeting where it's decided he should be deleted. Gene then tries to escape, running into Hi-5 (James Corden). Together, they decide to find a famous hacker named Jailbreak. (Anna Faris) She can take them to the Internet and reprogram Gene's code to make him normal again. It's a race against time though, because if it's not fixed, then Alex will erase his phone.So, I do want to start with what I did like about the movie. The animators did their jobs well. When Textopolis is introduced, there's a lot going on in the background. Movements look good and smooth enough. The designs leave much to be desired though. Most of the background characters are just their respective emojis with little dot eyes and arms and legs attached. For what they were given to work with though, the animators did a good job at capturing movement. I also found a couple of good gags. The old-fashioned emoticons (like \":)\") were depicted as the elderly citizens of the world, which I found clever. Other than that\u0085 there was little else.Now, for what you probably came here for. To start from the top: the setup of this entire movie is ridiculous! Apparently, it all starts when a human selects an emoji from their touchscreen. The order is sent down to a massive complex where there's a huge finger-shaped scanner. All the emoji citizens line up in their little boxes. If they are chosen, the scanner then takes a snapshot of them. That picture is then sent up to appear in the text box. It's such a round-about way to send emojis!There's also the world they live in. Gene has two parents, and it is revealed in the movie that he inherited his multi-facial malfunction from his father who had hidden it all these years. Does that mean emojis have children? It's Gene's first day on the job. Does that mean his father is retiring? Do emojis age and then die? Did Gene have to qualify for the job? There's so little explanation here that it leaves me more confused than anything else.And then there's the world outside Textopolis. We peek into different apps where activity is going on. When Gene and his allies jump into them to do stuff though, the app suddenly opens on Alex's phone causing disruptions. But why did the other apps humming with activity not cause any disruptions? Also, they say they have to go through different apps to reach their destination. It very clearly shows, though, that they can simply walk around them! Sure, you could say the anti-virus robots would get them\u0085 but the robots find them inside the apps anyways. Just save time and make a break for it! Now, getting down into the \"characters\". First of all, the dialogue in the movie is badly written and badly delivered. No high schooler actually says to another, \"Play it cool, just send her an emoji.\" The poor delivery only trims any potential impact the decent lines have. As for the characters themselves, they're all really bland. Gene says he wants to fit in, but he can't due to his varied expressions. Later in the movie though, it shows that he can change them just fine! Hi-5 is flat-out obnoxious: think Animal House-style frat bro. And then there's Jailbreak. T.J. Miller has stated before that he believes this movie sends \"a feminist agenda, but not in a preachy way.\" Well, he's wrong on both counts. Of the few \"feminist\" things Jailbreak says, they're so out-of-place that they come across as annoying. For example, as she explains the way to the cloud, Gene ends up finishing her sentence in excitement. She immediately reprimands him, saying \"Men are always taking credit for women's ideas!\" Now that's a pretty solid point, but\u0085 he was just excited about what she was saying. He didn't try to steal her idea at all. Not to mention, after being built up to be a \"strong female character\"... she ends up falling in love with Gene. She abandons her dream to be free in the cloud so she can come back home and be his princess, complete with a princess costume. For a movie touted to have such feminist ideas, I don't see very many here.Which brings me to the romances...~TRUNCATED FOR LENGTH. READ THE WHOLE REVIEW ON GOULDTHORPECREATES.TUMBLR.COM~",

The moral of the story is a bit of a miss but I doubt this was the reason most people saw this.It also goes to show that Patrick Stewart is up for a laugh by allowing himself to be cast as the poop emoji, by far the most unique role he's ever taken on.Overall it's great mindless fun for people of all ages and well worth at least one viewing.",

            "content": "The Emoji Movie (2017) is one of the movies that are hated and detested for its boredom and no humor. This is 2019 and it was released in 2017 and I saw the movie and it SUCKS. I had the same opinion as many other critics about this stupid movie and it's a WASTE OF TIME for Sony to produce and release this film that no one wants to see or like.\nT.J Miller voiced Gene, the main protagonist, James Corden as Hi-5, Anna Faris as Jailbreak and Patrick Stewart as .....POOP?? Like WHY? WHY DID THEY CHOOSE HIM AS POOP? THIS IS AN OUTRAGE AND SCANDAL! One of the most annoying things people concerned about this movie. Patrick Stewart is well-known, much for his Hollywood Walk of Fame and then this movie showed up and wanted him to play something that came from people's asses, a piece of excrement.\nThe plot is mostly TERRIBLE: an emoji Gene who couldn't have one but many emotions and turned to be an outcast and was called a malfunction by a really terrible villain Smiley and they tried to escape from her 'Bot'. And there is a place with a stupid name 'Textopolis' (a copycat of Metropolis and Monstropolis and Metrocity) We had enough copycats okay?? A place where emoji dreams to work in and be sent into...a text (it's their lives, what they live for). Also about this boy, Alex, who had a crush with a girl and didn't know what to text to impress her maybe. Like any horrible young filmmakers in competitions can have a plot like this but this is a movie in cinemas and Sony was just joking around and turned the movie into something that made audience feel bored and felt like a waste of money going to see this movie. And Sony is trying to waste their own money making this dumb piece of animation. I don't hate the animation, it's okay but every other thing is like the WORST! And there's a saying (maybe from an idiot) in this movie \"Emoji is the most important form of communication ever invented\" That's 100% wrong. Face-to-face is more important than that and when texting, letters are more important than emojis. This is like the movie is literally about emojis (nothing else, no text, no phone just...emojis) which really sucked the whole movie and turned it down for that reason and a few more.\nThe jokes here are 0% funny. None of them made me laugh and they're too easy. Monkey Business? I'm Tea, Not Coffee? WHAT? I'm so out of this, the movie had gone too far. They just had some stupid adventures over Candy Crush, Just Dance, ... And there's a stupid dance invented called the Emoji Pop? WHAT THE HECK??\nThe Screenplay is one of the WORST about the movie. The lines are too easy, like this movie is just...for...kids, childish kids that are called Young Buffaloes in Vietnam. There is no reason that this movie should exist. Sony had been a waste of time trying to animate the movie and find suitable voices. And you know how the ending went like? A DANCE SEQUENCE. Probably one of the worst animated endings...OF ALL TIME. And then in 2018, it won Worst Picture in the Razzies Award, an impressive Worst Picture.\nIf this was about an emoji who should stick one being 'Meh', I would go 'Meh Meh!' for this terrible movie.\nPoints: 0.9/10",

The animation is good, but good animation cannot save a bad film from being bad. \"Oh, but Gal\u00e1n, you're just not part of the film's target audience!\" I know that, but I'm also not part of the target audience for the films it rips off (Well I was when they came out) and I still enjoy them. Sony cancelled the Popeye movie for this, and the Popeye movie looked like it had more effort put into it, it looked more promising. I luckily didn't have to pay to see it, but to the fellows who rated 1 star and had to pay, I'm sorry.So the only things I liked were the animation, and that the teens looked like actual teens rather than twenty-something year olds (while they cast adults to play teens in live-action teen movies, I've seen some animation where the teens still look like adults).",

And we follow the emoji that has multiple emotions and he's supposed to be \"meh\". So he wants to kinda cure himself on this journey through all kinds of product placements possible.At the same time that boy Alex who owns the phone tries to make her like him with an emoji because I guess emojis and technology are the only way to express your feelings this days, and there's even a quote in this movie about how emojis is the most important form of human communication. I'm not lying, I'm not exaggerating, they said that. It's freaking line from this movie. If you still don't believe me, I don't blame you, just don't try to make sure while seeing it for yourself. You DO NOT need that in your life. You have better things to do with your time. Just imagine something like The Lego Movie, Tron and Inside Out if all of them were one giant cash-grab of a \"movie\". Halfway through, I couldn't even tell if I was watching a movie or a feature-length commercial. With every clich\u00e9 an animated kids movie could possibly fall into. Lead isn't who everyone wants him to be? Check. \"Funny\" sidekick on a journey? Check. Group arguing before the third act starts? Check. A character supposedly dies? Check. A dance sequence to a pop song (possibly by Pitbull)? Check. Only this one isn't even relevant anymore. Wanna know what it is? Well, even if you don't, I just can't resist. It's FEEL THIS MOMENT? GET IT?! BECAUSE THEY ARE EMOJIS AND THEY FEEL THINGS?! Ha, ain't that clever?!Okay, I don't think I have anything else to say and even if I do, it's probably nothing good.

The Emoji Movie: basically smash The Lego Movie and Wreck-It Ralph together and get a sentient aubergine to write it and you get the Emoji Movie- which is about Gene (T. J.

Then it could have turned into 'so bad it's good' kinda film, but sadly this is just a dull, zestless, pointless and oddly confusing movie which is only 1 hour and 31 minutes long but feels like 3 hours staring at a flickering light bulb with this stupid gormless smile. Patrick Stewart voices a poo emoji- do you want a more telling metaphor than that?The thing is for a movie about our emoji culture, it seems to hate its very subject matter, it makes fun of all its app related features but never goes full out on them so it's not even a satire of this culture. And of course the product placement is just the worse. There's literally a 10 minute sequence in the Candy Crush world where they play an actual game of Candy Crush. That said the beat moment in this \"movie\" was the Instagram part: the characters could walk into the photo itself and everything is frozen in place which is kinda nice but I've seen that done better in other movies- Looney Tunes: Back in Action did that with actual works of art, with the style of animation mirroring the style of art which is way more creative. Unsurprisingly this is a bad movie but no where near enough that it's worth any great deal of attention. If you want to see an alright animated movie anytime soon go see Cars 3 it's another Cars movie but that's more entertaining than this 'meh' movie. I give The Emoji Movie a D-.... But this was also my worst cinema going experience to date- never has the audience reflected the movie so well (they also were just the worst) and for that The Emoji Movie gets demoted to an F",

The people who came up with this movie should either be arrested for making this awful thing or be never allowed in making movies ever again. I admit that I had no intention of seeing this film, but because my little cousins thought, for some weird reason, that it would be good, they dragged me to it. I desperately tried to keep an open mind thinking, \"This may turn out to be like The Lego Movie. It sounds like garbage, but it may surprise me.\" You can guess how quickly those hopes were dashed.I could go into detail about the \"plot\", but if you've seen any of these \"be yourself\" kind of movies, then you have already seen The Emoji Film. The movie is predictable from start to finish, with no major surprises. It's inconstant as well when it comes to Gene and how he can't control his many emotions. Yet later on, he does so without any problem at all. What was the point of that? Speaking of Gene, the characters are not interesting at all, and I never cared about any of them. Gene is just a boring main character, and he's not interesting at all. The so called \"comedy relief\" of Hi-5 is more obnoxiously irritating than funny. Then there's this lady named Jailbreak who acts somewhat like one of those feminazis on Tumblr.The voice work is also pathetic too. Despite the great cast they had at their disposal, the actors sound so bored and uninterested in delivering their lines. Then again, the dialogue is ridiculous and most of it sounds like stuff no person would ever say like, \"Play it cool, just send an emoji.\" Who talks like that? I really got to wonder how they got these people to even be a part of this mess, especially Patrick Stuart. Were they that desperate for a paycheck that they sacrificed their dignity to be in this? The only thing I'll say to this movie's favor is the animation does look decent. Textopolis does look colorful and has some good attention to detail such as the old style emojis. It at least has some effort put into it, unlike this film.What makes The Emoji Movie so bad is not just because it's a movie about emojis, it's because this film does everything so lazily and doesn't care at all. The script is wretched with awful dialogue for everyone. The story is nothing interesting at all. It's unoriginal in every aspect and has nothing notable about it.The only amazing thing about this movie at the end was that nobody laughed, and most people left the theater (not that there were a lot of people) before the halfway point. Even my cousins, who begged me to take them to see it, realized how bad it was because they asked if we could leave a little after the halfway point, which we gladly did. They were at least nice enough to apologize for wasting time on seeing this boring, irritating, mess of a film.And to think that THIS is what canceled the Popeye animated movie; which looked like it had more love, care, and good jokes. Way to have your priorities straight, Sony!",

This is the sort of product - because this is not truly a movie, as the word \"movie\" is too suggestive of art - that corporations fawn over. And they did. Believe it or not, three major production studios *fought* to make this happen. Of course, they wouldn't spend too much: Minions, a product almost as artless as this one, cost $74 million and runs for 91 minutes. In comparison, The Emoji Movie cost $50 mil and runs for 86 minutes. A 91-minute-long Emoji Movie would cost a mere $52.91 million; Sony cares less than the company that brought us screaming yellow screen- fever. They threw as little as they could at it.But that's just the math. In order to fully appreciate how apocalyptic this wretched insult to all things sincere is, consider the following; You, the assumed person seeking entertainment, go to the movie theater expecting to take a break or have fun. And while the blatant advertising (Dropbox\u0099 is an important plot point, there's a pointless scene with Just Dance, apps all around etc.) and banality may be entertainingly laughable, the very same slithery gargoyles that gave you this product get the money. They count their cash, and they think \"Hey, that worked.\" So they give you more of the same thing. And more of it. And more, until the idiocy is familiar and the ads the norm. It's already happened to music, with the same notes and lyrics repeated over and over again. Here we have the same situation staring us down, except instead of ass and cash the contents are something else they're trying to sell you. The Emoji Movie is an ad that you pay to see. Of course product placement already exists in film. The Lego Movie and Toy Story both feature products as characters, but those films had heart and personality. Here, there is nothing but product placement. Anything resembling humanity is just padding for the next app to appear. How vile for a product that constantly tells you to \"express yourself.\"Do not watch this thing. Don't bring your kids to see it. Don't watch it ironically. Whatever your beliefs, biases, intentions, anything, do not give companies the thumbs up to feed us mediocre, heartless drivel.",

I will not spoil a single thing about this magnificent movie's existence. But I will tell you that after watching the movie, you will never be the same person again. I finally reached tranquillity and became the happiest being in the whole multi-cosmos because of it. It opened my eyes and made me realise, why are we puny things sitting in our chairs, wasting our lives away, playing Roblox, writing satirical reviews on IMDb about garbage movies, when we can get out of bed in the morning, crack a smile, and say, ''I want to make a movie about Emojis.'' Our puny minds are not capable of developing or putting that thought into action. This proves that The Emoji Movie is a gift from the Gods. A sign that, even in the deepest of hells, there is hope, there is light. I pray to Gene and Hi-5 every night and sleep with my Gene bodypillow. I have an Emoji fidget spinner. I am happy.

            "content": "(Now, the title of this review my anger you a little bit, but I'll be very honest, I haven't seen Foodfight or Norm of the north yet, plus, it's just how I fell about this thing, so deal with it). Oh god, this film was just painful, something so painful that I don't know how Sony pictures animation could make something that would become the worst thing I've seen, why i'm so mad, because Sony is great! I know there are those people who don't think Sony is one of the best animated studios, but I love them, sure, some of the Open Season sequels suck donkey meat, but aside from those, Sony makes a lot of awesome and perfect movies, but, The Emoji Movie, well, it sucks, in fact, it sucks so badly, and there's reasons why, anyway, let's destroy this phone of garbage. The plot of this movie is about Gene, who has more than one emotion and everyone in the phone hates him from what he is, including his parents which will be mentioned later, because of this, he decides to go on an adventure with his friends, Hi-5 and Jalibreak, to get to the Dropbox and make Gene meh, meanwhile, the phone's user, Alex, wants to impress a girl named Ady, but thanks to Gene, he wants to delete his entire phone, because of this, everyone in the phone gets paranoid and their leader Smiler wants to delete Gene. Now let's talk about the pros, which is a surprise, because the only good thing about this is the casting who made a pretty good job at acting like these characters, even if the cast can be disappointing for many people (which I honestly think some of the cast made good things) they still do a good job. But then there are the cons: 1. The character designs aren't really great, sure, the animation is very colorful, but even in the beginning of the film I forgot these things were meant to be an Emoji, I thought these things were mutated aliens or human-like lemons, that really says something to me, which is that not even a title is enough to convince me these beings are meant to be an Emoji. 2. The humor really sucks, most of the humor is made out of puns who are just repetitive or never hit bulls eye, poop jokes that is also horrible fro beginning to end, and horrible humor, now kids movies can have a little dark side, but those are just dark themes, not adult jokes kids don't get (and that's another reason to why you shouldn't show your kid this). 3. The characters themselves are really bad, first you Gene which is the only character that I've found likable, yet still, he doesn't do much to save the movie, Jailbreak has no original element in her character, she's just 4 stereotypes matched in one, those are: The tomboy, the love interest, the princess who only wants a prince, and the smart woman who has a temper for everything, Hi-5 is definitely the worst character in this movie, as he is as funny as a guy who broke his legs and has no brain, worst of all thought, he doesn't learn that he's actions have consequences, the only things he learn is that friend is more important than fame and that eating too much candy can give you stomach-ace, that's it, those are the only things he learns, poop is also unfunny but thank god he doesn't have too much screen time, Gene's parents can kinda have good qualities, but the fact they always act meh makes them really annoying, Smiler has the same issue, however her issue isn't annoying but instead creepy, Alex can be likable when bullied, but he doesn't have a lot to care about him and he's also dumb, Ady has no personality, and every other emoji are just there so they can throw the message of ''if one person has one emotion, she'll always have one emotion''. 4. The plot itself is unoriginal, as it rips off movies like: Wreck-it Ralph, Inside out, The LEGO movie, Smurfs: The lost village, Wizard of Oz and even the Rugrats Movie. 5. The idea of an Emoji having more than one emotion is really stupid cause seriously, how can they be allowed to have more than one emotion? 6. The message of this movie is repetitive, I mean, we all know that people likes us from what we are, so why repeat it one more time? 7. How can Emojis reproduce if they don't have the material to do it? 8. The ending makes 0 sense, now I don't wanna spoil too much, but let 's just say that Gene saves the day by becoming a multi-expression Emoji thanks to scenes from the movie. 9. How can Emojis make pop culture references if they live in a phone! 10. This film isn't really a movie, and instead a commercial compilation that takes 86 minutes In the end, The Emoji Movie sucks garbage truck, I know I said the Open Season sequels suck donkey meat, but this sucks donkey meat and a truck full of garbage combined, now, you guys might say, ''This is a kids movie, stop hating it!'', I know what you guys are saying, and yes, you can love this movie, but saying it's a kids movie it's an incredibly weak defense, because kids movies have likable characters, original and creative stories, good humor, good lessons, great animation and sad moments, and when it turns a few of these things in cons, it's still forgiven, now, does the Emoji Movie have that, well, apart from Gene and a bit of Alex being likable, this does everything backwards, so the next time you want to do a movie like The Emoji Movie, Sony, than remember: Don't do it, because it's only gonna make things worse, so please, don't revisit this abomination!",

After messing up and having the wrong face when he's scanned, Gene sets out on a mission to become a real emoji, and to only be meh. I personally think that this is a gem of a movie. Of course, it's much less for adults, and any one that's rather anti technology, but this has some serious life lessons in it:1) Friendship is important2) Don't bend to society's rules3) Being you is the best you you can beThere was nothing I really took from it, of course, as I knew these already, but considering this film is aimed at the technology age of children, this is an absolutely brilliant movie to take your kids to see. Maybe you won't enjoy it, but they definitely will, and it will teach them things along the way.Not as good as other movies, such as Inside Out, but this is a gem, and it really does have a lot to it, rather than being an annoying movie marketed on a trend.",

I can't believe it!The fact that this joke of a film was commissioned over one of animation's greatest heroes whom eats Spinach makes the existence of The Emoji Movie all the more painful in itself.

The majority of the humor is weak and immature, especially with the Poop Emoji. Some of the gags managed to make me chuckle, not laugh but I did find enjoyment. The animation is good, it's colorful and energetic, and there are some creative scenes, even with the product placement scenes. However the designs of the Emojis are really, really simplistic and some are even creepy. The characters are not interesting. Gene is the same old \"I wan't to fit in\" character, and the other characters are also the same old tropes as well. The characters also have their developments presented in the most generic way possible. The characters that stand out for me is the villain and Gene's parents. Mostly because they supply the best comedy and the villain has an this crazy personality that kept me active. The Emoji Movie is a meh film that's suited to entertain kids.",

Finally, I would just like to say on this review, this is a all time low for a movie by trying to brainwash kids on saying being on your phone 24/7 is way important than hanging out with your family and friends in person without a phone.",

No. Of course not. it was not intended to be that sort of movie. It is the story of a broken emoji's quest to become un-broken. He must journey through different apps on the phone in order to reach the cloud. On this journey we get to see an imaginative view of what different apps could look like if the were \"real\". It is pretty clever, really. The Emoji Movie is full of humor (the joke about the elderly is HILARIOUS) and it has Steven Wright voicing the main character's father. I think this movie is definitely worth watching if you have kids... They'll love it and I would think the parents would enjoy it too.",

The early reviews were beyond awful and many called the film one of the worst ever made. The film would still get a theatrical release but even the normal family friendly folks were pretty harsh on it. Sadly, my 2-year-old daughter loves to watch the film so I've had to sit there and cringe as she laughs.I must admit that I'm going to join the group of people who thinks this is a truly awful movie. One of the worst movies ever made? I wouldn't say that but I will say that it's one of the very worst animated movies ever made and in fact it might be the very worst that I've seen. As of writing this, I can't think one of animated movie that I have hated more than this one.There's no doubt that the biggest issue with this movie is the writing. The screenplay is deadly dull and it pretty much hits every cliche that you'd expect from an animated movie. The animation business is really booming now with some terrific and original films but this here is not it. THE EMOJI MOVIE really comes across as something no one put any effort into because they knew they could release it and the thing would make money.The only good thing that can be said about the picture is that the animation is wonderful. With that said, the rest of the movie is just pure boredom that has one awful joke after another and the characters are beyond lame and boring.",

Man, you read a few reviews and subconsciously movie fanatics have closed minds and they don't give anything a fair chance. The movie wasn't that bad, people. The premise of the film was about an \"emoji\" who cannot conform so they try to delete him. Yes, he plays hero in the end like most animated films. God, how boring. There are no such things as happy endings, just death and taxes. I didn't see much product placement and yes they needed the main character, the lovelorn Alex, to tie the movie up. Who do you think uses phones? sheep? To sound redundant, the movie is centered around a failed emoji who tries to find his identity (like all of us wayward numskulls)Emoji's are contained in cell phones so of course that's where the movie takes place, inside a phone. The reviews I've read are ludicrous. For what it's worth, the film did a great job given it's limited space (for the nth time, a cell phone.)Let's bring back the Sixties & Seventies where people were more open minded and there was no such thing as political correctness.",

The plot isn't even that clear, and it's hard to understand why anyone's doing anything in the first place. The interactions between characters are weird and unnatural.But let's start from the obvious. This film contained two game tutorials and three demonstrations. You can practically see a little four year old thinking about how great Dropbox is as they watch this excuse for a motion picture.You would assume a movie to be enjoyable, artistic, original, and funny. The Emoji Movie is none of these things. Absolutely unoriginal - a typical story about someone who doesn't fit in. None of the jokes in this entire movie even made me smile.

And, considering these are emojis, it just didn't make sense to stick so close to a rather overused formula. Additionally, the film had what seemed like hundreds of jokes relating to computers and social media....and each and every one of them fell flat. And, several of these 'jokes' involved the poop emoji. This is because in none of these was there even a hint of humor or cleverness. I noticed one review where the reviewer gives this one a 10.

This is one of those movies that will be dated in five years just like Rad, The Wizard, Super Mario Bros., and any other movie whose plot is based largely upon popular culture.Most, if not every pop culture movie is bad. Just like most, if not every song based upon pop culture is bad (\"Let Me Take a Selfie\" comes immediately to mind). And Emoji Movie is bad. Emoji movie is bad and it didn't need to be made.The main character, Gene (T.J. Miller), is a \"meh\" emoji on Alex's phone that cannot contain his emotions. He's supposed to be just meh but he emotes all kinds of other things. He's an emotional cornucopia. In his big debut as an emoji he had a meltdown and nearly wrecked the entire app. To avoid being permanently erased he goes on this cross-smartphone adventure which was an adventure to find himself.The concept would be alright if:It hadn't been done tons of times already and done better.We weren't talking about software.Emojis are software creations designed to do one thing: pictorially display an emotion for a user to select . The very idea that they have other emotions yet are being forced by an artificial social paradigm to be other than what they are is ridiculous. Like our apps are captives doing our bidding by force. My goodness Hollywood anthropomorphizes everything. Nothing can be just a tool, or a device, or an inanimate object created to do a task. Everything is secretly a conscious intelligent creature just playing a role that it has been forced to. It is such a tired message.Of course, the movie concludes with Gene being allowed to display his full range of emotions. Alex was so impressed by this new emoji that he sent it to the girl he liked and instantly she was taken by this emoji as well.Get this, she said she was happy to see someone that could communicate his feelings so well. HA! Are you serious? The boy didn't even bother to type a single word, yet he is an effective communicator. Welcome to the 21st century.So, the next time you get ready to send a text message expressing your emotions, look for that one glitch of an emoji that expresses all of your emotions. Even if you don't find that glitch of an emoji and you have to choose a single emotion emoji remember that it has other feelings too. Consider your emoji's feelings when you select it, and try to use them all on a regular basis lest they should feel left out.",

It's so unfunny and the \"plot\" (I use that loosely) just doesn't make sense. Also, it has SO MUCH PRODUCT PLACEMENT, including TWO GAME TUTORIALS. IT'S JUST SO BAD.

The plot is ridiculous as it features an emoji named Gene who gets in trouble because for five seconds he can't put up the right emotion. Yeah, the entire plot is kicked off by something as ridiculous as that. How can you really feel for a guy who messes up something that takes mere seconds? There's this other character named Jailbreaker and right away, I knew she was going to be the love interest. Okay, they don't quite get together but you know what's coming. There's a talking piece of poop voiced by Patrick Stewart. He serves no role or purpose as do 90% of these obnoxious characters. This falls into all the pitfalls of most bad animated movies. Songs, celebrity voices, and fart jokes. Don't people realize these are the ingredients for an awful animated movie? This movie doesn't even believe in its own moral. I'm going to say right now that this is the worst movie of the year. There should be a Razzie for worst animated feature.It features Jailbreaker who is revealed to be a princess and the moral is that you can be anyone you want to be and there's few options for females. She actually stays a princess! That completely breaks the moral of the story! There's also the human character who owns the phone. He is one of the most bland and forgettable side characters I have ever seen in a movie. You don't even have to watch \"The Lego Movie\" to hate this. That film showed how something as plot less as a toy can be made into a great movie. This shows how something plot less can be made into something plot less. I did kind of like the animation, but even that seemed off, especially with Jailbreaker's body. I wish I could say this was just meh. *",

            "content": "Many say that being the greatest film of all time is inacheiveable. There are many options as to what that film could be. But if you are a 1000000 IQ, social-economic genius like me who enjoys emotionally mature, and rich movies you can say without a shadow of a doubt that The Emoji Movie is at the top of your list. Where do I begin with this diamond in the rough. How about the characters:The characters are the best I've ever seen. Each character introduced made me smile and jump up with joy more than the last. Like the Hi-5 emoji played by James Corden, who does an Oscar-worthy job portraying this hand with an eating disorder. Always how I pictured my hand. He made me laugh the most in this sea of endless laughs, but we'll get to that in a moment. My favorite scene with him is when he vomits up a candy corn and Gene tells him not to eat it again, and he eats it again! I was on the floor clenching my stomach. Gene's emotional \"emoji\" struggle is something for the ages and Jailbreak's feminity is so inspirational. They could've fallen into cliches for her, but they managed to avoid it in the best way possible with a line that perfectly capitivates her character: \"Women are always coming up with stuff that men are taking credit for.\" Perfect feminist icon. And the other characters are so fluid and fun like the Patrick Stewart one who gives birth to another poop!The writing is a chef's kiss personified. The laughs are spot-on with each joke giving me more of a reason to watch like other amazing epics like Arctic Dogs and Shark Tale. The scenes and their construction are beyond godly. The flow of the film flows more naturally as it continues to dance the emoji pop! The product placements were perfectly integrated into the story and I hardly noticed them most of the time. They were THAT subtle unlike The Lego Movie which completely flopped on that front. The animation is at a crisp 100 frames per second at 4K quality. It was orgasmic to see the characters moving on screen. And how could I forget about Alex? Yeah screw Inside Out, this is just the more clearly defined version of Riley complete with the song Bubble butt! The human girl character is on number 3 on my current waifu list which I will post later on Youtube. She is also heavily defined which unlike most Pixar films, made me feel like I needed to do this thing.My main crique with this astonishing work of art is that it has no minions. No references, no jokes about them, not even a shout out. The movie didn't even have minion like characters. If it had them, dang it it would've been a 1234/100 but it will just get a 1233/100 from me. Share with your friends and have a movie night with this breathtaking muse of society today.",

She did lots of evil with that huge grin permanently affixed over her entire body. The CGI was excellent and the plot was entertaining and I had a good movie-going experience. Not exactly a classic, but quite good by my standards.Then I read some critics' reviews and I wondered if I had seen the same movie. It was unrelenting bashing and a competition to see who could be the most insulting. Critics are frequently stampeded into Groupthink and are often simply afraid to go against the general consensus for fear of appearing to be less hip than all their associates, so I didn't think much of it.Then I saw some of the IMDb user reviews. Wow! Everybody was clearly on the edge of suicide just from watching a cartoon. Or else they were contemplating poking their own eyes out with barbecue forks in order to avoid the chance of ever seeing \"The Emoji Movie\" again, or anything else even close to being that horrendous.So anyway, I thought I'd throw my own thoughts out there just for the heck of it. like I said, \"Emoji\" gave me a lot of laughs and a good time. To me, it doesn't even remotely resemble the reviews I read, and I recommend you give it a try if you're interested and are not scared away by all the negativity.",

            "content": "To be honest, I saw The Emoji Movie only to understand why it gets so much hate. As a Redditor I understand why I am supposed to hate this movie (because...emojis?), but why does the normie audience hate it? Isn't this movie supposed to be like, their dream come true? Don't they always keep spamming emojis in all their sentences when writing a message or making a meme? When the movie hadn't come out it was being advertised a lot, so I thought people are supposed to be excited. Even the animation of this movie seemed really good. But I watched it and now I know the problem.The Emoji Movie is very ignorant. It talks about emojis as if it is supposed to be something very cool. In reality only elders, women and children use emojis when they message (because they are the only ones we can't slap some sense into). But then again the target audience here is the children. So considering this movie is from their point of view, emojis are supposed to be shown as though they mean a lot to them. So let's come to the second point. The emojis are shown to have their entire personality revolving around their expression. Why can't they just be doing their job? Also how come so many emojis look similar? Is it like only one of them goes to the emoji keyboard while the others have no business? There are so many questions that the movie doesn't answer.I don't know which problem plagues this movie the most. Is it the product placement? No, it just gives a feeling of adventure. None of the product placement looks as much on the nose as everyone describes. Like in TVF Originals they straight up speak out to advertise the things. Here at least Gene and Hi-5 are going to those places to see what is happening over there. I kinda found the Candy Crush part funny and relaxing at the same time. There was also the Just Dance part, and that was definitely cringy. But that was the only cringy one. Facebook, Skype, Drop Box - everything else was quite decent.The jokes weren't half as bad, considering this is aimed for kids. Even I used to make many poop jokes when I was 13. If there even was anything bad, the animation and music compensated for it. The idea that there are so many emojis that we can establish and entire world using it is actually something I'm guessing everyone must have thought at some point. The one part that I surely felt was cringy was when the kid gets to ask out his crush because he sent her a custom emoji. Only if life functioned that easily. Hi-5 was also pretty disgusting. Every time he kept his hand (thumb) down it used to hurt me. Imagine bending your thumb down that much. Also when he ate the salivated candy I felt like vomiting.The Emoji Movie is a bad movie, yes, but it's still better than many animated movies I have seen. Food Fight, Delhi Safari, Roadside Romeo, Geng: The Adventure Begins, Pangaa Gang, the entire Super Bheem series - there are plenty of examples of animated movies that are even worse than this. It does have redeeming qualities, even if they are not enough to make this a genuinely good movie. I can imagine the animators must have worked hard on this movie even if they didn't agree with the script. And that is the reason why I have massive respect for them.",

But we didn't realize how awful it would be.The movie is written by an obvious sociopath trying to convince everyone that they are a completely normal person, with lines like \"Just play it cool and send her an Emoji,\" or \"Oh, I hate knocking over the elderly.\" The delivery of said lines just drives this point home: nobody says any line in any kind of convincing or believable manner, just with some random emotional inflection that vaguely applies to the matters at hand.The characters are equally baffling as well: most characters have no arc whatsoever and just end the movie exactly where they started, but the few that do have \"character development\" accomplish that within 5 minutes of their internal conflict being introduced. There is a scene in which Anna Farris's character tells T.J. Miller's that she's always \"looking out for number one,\" he gives a ham-fisted line that was supposed to be profound, and she immediately decides that she agrees with him. Meanwhile, they are having this conversation immediately after they believe James Corden's character has DIED, and are treating that fact as though it was a mild inconvenience.Plus, this movie also just doesn't have any rules whatsoever. James Corden, while trapped in the trash, read an e-mail that was never sent, and thus Anna Farris never had any access to because it was trashed immediately. As soon as he brings it up, however, Anna Farris IMMEDIATELY finds it and can read it perfectly easily. Then, just a short scene later, one single Emoji DOWNLOADS THE SOURCE CODE TO THE CLOUD. Because yeah, you can just do that. And at the movie's climax, everyone dies, but then are brought back to life because Jake T. Austin's human character unplugged his phone from the 'Phone Delete Machine,' because yep, that's how phones work.The attempts at 'humor' caused me to legitimately tug at my hair and curl inward in my seat. My friends and I were completely floored by the sheer absurdity that was this movie, and when we left the theater, we were physically exhausted. I had a splitting headache after it was all said and done, and when someone else asked me how I felt about it, I was just at a loss. I don't know if I can even go on anymore, having experienced the sheer soul-sucking emotional black hole that is the Emoji Movie.",

A lot of how you receive this film will depend on whether you like James Corden. He is a polarising figure, but as the main comic character Hi-5, he has the brunt of the film's funny lines. I'm not the biggest fan of his, but he wasn't too obnoxious in this.This is really a film of two halves. The first half is based in the city of Textopolis and about one emoji - a \"meh\" emoji and his attempts to fit in. This was funny for about 5 minutes, seeing \"meh\" interact will all the other emojis lead to some laughs but the joke went on for half an hour and ran somewhat thin.The film came to life when the emojis-on-the-run left Textopolis and started making their way through other apps, such as facebook, youtube, instagram, candy crush, spotify, the trash file, just dance, a hacker app and dropbox on their way to the cloud. All the jokes about apps, their users, what people use apps for, how they waste their time on them etc. was really funny and on point. Although I think the gags would have flown straight over the heads of young kids. A joke about distracting the anti-virus bots by making them watch kitten videos on youtube had me roaring with laughter.So as I say, the film is not that bad. It's nothing amazing, but it has some very funny moments, has a positive message and is not even close to the travesty the reviews and scores suggest. I'd say 7/10 is a fair score.",

So I walked into the cinema with an open mind and high expectations.\nAnd wouldn't you know it, I was severely disappointed at this movie. The movie struggled so hard to create funny moments which turned out to be cringy attempts at humor (especially the dance sequence).\nDon't get me wrong, I was impressed by the great animation, and that's the only good thing about this movie. I feel sorry for the animators who have put in so much effort into this junk of a movie.\nI feel like I shoudn't even call this a movie or a film. The Emoji Movie feels like an 86-minute advertisement with bland, cheesy, cringy dialogue and lazy writing. Other animated movies (for example the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy and the Toy Story trilogy) in comparison have so much more effort put into them.\n\"But this is made for children! You're over-analysing it!\"\nSo are you saying that we shouldn't judge children films? Are you saying that every single movie made for children is great/perfect? According to this logic, Food Fight and Cool Cat Saves the Kids deserve 10/10, don't they? The target demographic of this movie does not, and will not, affect the fact that this movie is horrible. I'm so tired of hearing this excuse.\nBy the way, if you say that this is the best movie you have ever watched, you're paid by Sony or the director of this movie to write a positive review, or you're sarcastic, or this is the only film you have ever watched. Go watch the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, Toy Story trilogy and others and see if they change your mind.\nOverall, the only positive aspect of this 'movie' is it's animation, but i's quickly overwhelmed by the negative aspects (writing, plot, characters, development, etc.).\nThe animation brought this movie from 0/10 to 1/10, and that's about it.",

            "content": "The Emoji Movie...boy am I embarrassed to have seen this thing. This movie essentially has an A and B plot that work off each other. The A plot is about a 'meh' emoji named Gene who is able to make multiple other expressions. When working at the cube, he messes up terribly by making a face other than a 'meh'. With his new friend Hi-5 and a hacker named Jailbreak, they must find a way to transform him into a 'normal' emoji by journeying through the smartphone. The B plot revolves around a freshman named Alex who tries to get the attention of Addie McCallister by sending her emojis...When I first found out about this movie I thought it was a joke. I just thought it was an April Fools Day prank pulled by Sony, but when the trailer for this movie arose in December, I feared for the worst...I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with the A plot. You may notice that it sounds really familiar, and it does. It sounds like the plot of Wreck-It Ralph. Just from the second trailer I knew that we would get a Wreck-It Ralph vibe. That's essentially what the concept of the A plot is. It's like they took the concept of warping from world to world presented in that movie and put it in a smartphone. The movie doesn't even go in-depth into what Gene's condition is. It just tells you that Gene can express multiple emotions and expect you to roll with it. All that does is bring analytic viewers to question the ideas of the movie. When it comes to the A plot though, it's just linear, predictable and unpleasant to sit through.Hi-5 is a pointless character. All he does is act as the comic relief, and he even fails at that, as he didn't make me laugh once throughout the picture. The jokes in this movie are all cringeworthy. None of them hit. There were kids in the theater who hardly laughed at all, that's how bad these jokes were. There was only one joke that made me laugh and even that one will eventually become dated.The product placement is incredibly annoying. Throughout the movie we see many different real world apps like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and even Candy Crush. I just felt cheap looking at these and many parts of the movie felt like advertisements for smartphone apps. They even try to be \"cool and hip\" with the kids. There is modern slang usage, movie references and even references to songs that went viral two to three years ago. For example, they play the Nae Nae song by Silento in hopes that kids in the audience can relate. You're not relating to your audience, you're pandering to them. It's not like in Wreck-It Ralph, for instance, where they bring in classic video game icons for viewers to relate to. The difference of bringing these different products in is that the classic video game icons are timeless, while the Nae Nae song became dated.There's also a sub-plot that I won't spoil that feels so pointless, and I say this for two reasons. One, the movie only cuts to that part twice. Second, the characters involved in said plot point don't get anywhere new.As for the B plot, it's probably the best part of this entire film, which isn't saying anything. The characters outside the smartphone are boring, but at least they're not annoying like the emojis. The animation for those scenes looks pretty good for the most part. Even saying that the B plot is the best part isn't saying much. Even the way that plot ends feels predictable.If you are a kid who is really into emojis, chances are that you will enjoy this film. Even at that, I don't think anyone else would enjoy it, just small kids to early teenagers. It's a terrible animated feature that's down there with Norm of the North that's unfunny, linear, empty, full of product placement and is just awful.2/10",

The animation quality, visual setting, and adding a few real-life app names looks inviting on the outside, but upon entering its world and inner workings, it was a waste and abysmal to take seriously as a \"movie.\" As though it poorly replicated Pixar's Inside Out concept crossed with the technological theme of Disney's Wreck-It Ralph.I've seen plenty of animated features as both a kid and as an adult, but this is one you'd probably not want to see at a movie theater. It's pretty much a desperate, by-the-numbers cash grab done by all things Sony Animation, who had produced a few SO much better animated titles in the past.In the city of Textopolis, an emoji called Gene (T.J. Miller) is designed to be like his parents (both \"meh\" icons), but for some reason he has multiple ways of expressing himself in the smartphone of young teen Alex that it confuses those around him and his own user. Hoping to find his place, he goes on an adventure with female emoji hacker Jailbreak (Anna Faris) to have a true purpose in his user's data space.Director Tony Leondis said he was greatly inspired by Toy Story's concept, but his approach in using that for emojis doesn't work if the story squanders it with a predictable ending and difficult-to-like, cardboard characters. Other films that used the concept like say, Wreck-It Ralph and The LEGO Movie had a premise and morals that weren't questionable or inane. No. Instead, those movies emitted both the mythos and pathos in an intriguing and creative way. I don't blame the movie's voice cast at all for this mistake, it's the \"story\" that was unoriginal and a hodgepodge, including jokes that were too juvenile to find as funny.Overall, this'll attract the littler ones, but this flick is best suited as direct-to-DVD, not theater worthy.",

            "content": "When I first read the news that there is an animated full-length feature film being developed called \"The Emoji Movie\", I took my hand and forcefully applied it to my forehead. This movie was absolutely uncalled for, yes, we do live in a generation where everyone has a phone or computer and sends each other instant messages, sometimes adding emoticons to reflect their state, but that doesn't justify the need for it. What made sense to pour out $50 million into making this picture? And how come it ended up making over $250 million at the box office? It's beyond comprehension....\"The Emoji Movie\" centers on a city called Textopolis, which is basically in everyone's smartphone, and the residents of Textopolis are various emojis that have a daily job of making faces and emotions whenever the phone user selects one of them in a text message.The main character is Gene Meh, a...\"Meh\" emoji that doesn't like to stick to the norm of one single emotion and is targeted for deletion due to his multi-expressions. He bands up with other malfunctioned emojis in order to escape from the software agents that are hunting them and find the Code to fix Gene. The adventure takes them through various apps like Just Dance, Candy Crush or Instagram. The film is literally a marketing gimmick for phone apps.\nThe fact that Sir Patrick Stewart appears in the film as the Poop emoji had me worried for a bit, but fortunately his appearance is short and minor.The animations aren't half-bad, but that's about the only good part of the movie. All the jokes fall flat, there was not a single moment where I actually laughed.\nJudging by the targeted audience of teens and pre-teens, I expected to have more triumph over toys and merchandise, but it didn't really pick up.\"The Emoji Movie\" is a film that shouldn't have been made and instead should have invested the budget into something else.",

            "review_title": "An Icon Of Lost Potential: A Serious Review of The Emoji Movie",
            "content": "In today's world, the phone isn't used quite as the inventors pictured, with actual calling being replaced by texting and snapchat. But one item has been developed to replace the words that are too difficult to write: Emojis. In desperation, Sony has developed a film about these icons in an attempt to break the bank with another hit animated series. Can they succeed, or will this movie be nothing but a bombardment of sad faced emojis? Robbie K here to answer that question for you with another review. LIKES:The Animation: You can say a lot of negative things about the movie, but one plus for this reviewer is the beautiful display Sony's team has designed. Like many movies, the characters move with fluid grace, transitioning through their adventure with little jumpiness. High Five (James Corden) in particular has impressive moves, as having a hand expand beyond simple hand movements can be tricky business. In addition, I enjoyed the visualization of the world within our phone, finding clever design in the development of the internal universes of each app (primarily Instagram's frozen pictures). I'll admit, the characters aren't realistic like Pixar, or even super creative design, but there is cleverness in the world itself. It's Cute: When it comes to cartoons/animated marvels, the pendulum can swing to either side of the age spectrum. Fear not those with little kids, this movie is certainly geared towards the younger side, filled to the brim with color, simplistic jokes, and over the top slapstick that will make many giggle. Sure, there are a few drier jokes that adults will get, but for the most part this movie goes back to basics for family friendliness. One won't have to worry about inappropriate gestures or innuendos in this film. The Morals: Movies are a powerful tool to teach the lessons we humans are too ignorant to learn from mentors, school, and the quickly fading trend of reading. Emoji's movie solid lesson of being yourself and not conforming to the traditional ways is as good rehash of the traditional lesson. Those who stand out from the norm will find great relevance to Gene (T.J. Miller) and Jailbreak's (Anna Faris) quest and most likely grab on to the characters. It's also always good to see a lesson in friendship as well, quoting the movie as \"Better to have one good friend, than a bunch of fake fans followers\". The strong emphasis on this will hopefully break through the persistent firewalls of your subconscious and get you contacting your buddies. DISLIKES:Story: Despite the morals infused into the story, the overall quality of Gene's tale is very basic at best. The Emoji movie has little sustenance to it, diving more into cramming the jokes in the short run time. After all the world building I had hoped for a little more depth to navigating the apps, facing the dangers of the cyber terror that lurk in our phones. I wanted suspense! I wanted exploration of a selection of apps. I wanted an adventure that had a little more depth behind it. I got very little of that. All the obstacles they faced were fairly easy to circumvent, and often not worth mentioning at how lame they were. Certainly, they did a few things right (Just Dance 4), but for the most part, it was a huge loss of potential at decoding the craziness of our obsession with phones. Humor: Humor can be fun when balanced, but unfortunately Emoji movie lacks that balance, once again swinging the pendulum to the younger audience. Most of the jokes are very simple statements that lack any finesse, or decent delivery to maximize the laughs. Much of the humor is dry, and although has adult components, lacks that clever zing that other films/programs do. James Corden rectifies this a little with High Fives self-absorbed personality, but even his banter gets stale after a while. With all of the comedians in this movie, I really had expected more of this movie, but again missed potential. Boring: If you haven't gleamed it from the first two categories, then this should sum this up, Emoji movie is boring. There is no suspense to the adventure, and let's face it no point, to the challenges at hand. I found myself looking at the clock wondering how much longer I had in the ridiculous presentation of smart phone gimmicks. Cute is always great, but it is better left to YouTube and Kid shows that are in short spans of time. Without the jokes to back it up, nor an impressive voice performance, there is just little to scream entertainment outside of watching a child's smile light up at the colorful presentation. The VERDICT:You've seen the reviews of my colleagues, and they aren't far from the truth\u0085 Emoji movie was a miss for Sony in terms of quality. The lackluster jokes, lack of challenge, and reserved wit were not the right steps to take in this inconsistent adventure for success. In fact, the best thing of this film is the animated short for Hotel Transylvania that precedes it. Still, if you are looking for a safe, family trip to the movies, you've got the Emoji movie to save your bacon. However, I highly recommend reserving this one for Netflix. My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 4.0 Movie Overall: 2.0",

            "content": "Are you sure, 'a picture is worth a thousand words'!? It seems, by this picture that it isn't. From a filmmaking perspective, this movie directed by Anthony Leonis tanked on several levels from unfunny cringe-worthy dialogue and jokes from comedy writers, Mike White & Eric Siegel to extremely rushed jarring animation from Sony Animation Studios to meet the deadline, thus making certain frames of uneven motion. However, I do appreciate, what, Leondis was trying to go for. I kinda dig, unlocking the digital world, inside your smartphone. After all, I'm a huge fan of a similar concept, in which South Park, unlocked, the Facebook app in Season 14th, Episode 4 'You Have 0 Friends'. I also understand, what the director wanted with the protagonist, Gene Meh (Voiced by T.J Miller) being different from the other emojis and trying to find his place, in a world, where everybody expects you to be one thing. It's something, people can relate to. I also comprehend the purpose of using an emoji, when it come to the digital age. They are a good addition to express emotions in the otherwise very emotion-less world of instant messaging and typed up conversations on the computer. Plus, they really do cut down, on the amount of words & sentences, it takes to text somebody. Nevertheless, emojis also come across, as annoying if use incorrectly; which seem to happen right here. Instead, of cutting down, screen-time, the emojis in this film, add more. They are just way, too talkative. A good example is, sidekick, Hi-5 (Voiced by James Corden), whom character seems to drag the plot down with his endless amount of chitchat & tomfoolery, after the 1st act. There were a lot of moments that they could cut, with him. One great example is the trash app escape scene in the middle act. What was the point of seeing that, if we going to see, yet another delete moment near the climax? In truth, it was completely unnecessary & kinda ruin the tension, knowing that delete emojis can come back. Not only that, some of the other emojis subplot are also extremely excessive. Why do, Gene's parents, Mel Meh (Voiced by Steven Wright) & Mary Meh (Voiced by Jennifer Coolidge) have a time-consuming sequence of them, looking for Gene!? Couldn't that, be cut, in order, to focus more on Gene's self-discovery. Also, learning, where Gene got, his special powers, kinda ruins the mystique. It just doesn't help, the plot. Another thing, the movie could had delete, was Jailbreak (Voiced by Anna Faris)'s subplot, about complaining about sexism and gender inequality. This isn't the film for that; seeing how the film showcases multiple examples of female emojis who aren't tied to a gender-specific-role, including Smiler (Voiced by Maya Rudolph) and Gene's mom. Also, whether or not, Jailbreak has legitimate feelings for Gene, shouldn't had been a focus. The idea that Gene turn back to a meh, because of reject love than reprogramming, is a bit shallow and horrible clich\u00e9s. It makes the whole journey to the cloud, pointless. Things like that, shouldn't had been brought up, if they were going with feminism approach with the character. It's clear, that this film has a desire to say something about the modern day world, but it lack the sophistical story-telling, needed to provide social commentary. There is no greater example of that, than the movie botch-attempt on addressing the negative issues of mobile phone have on contemporary society, through the viewpoint of Gene's phone owner, Alex (Voiced by Jake T. Austin). It's here, where the movie shows the extreme changes on the conversation style from face-to-face to text based conversation, adverse effects on relationships, distractions, and lack of emotional depth. However, it was all wasted potential, as the movie went back on everything, it was originally, trying to say, about being too dependence on your phone with having a emoji tell, all of your complex feelings for you; instead of just using your mouth. It's a totally misguided message that undermine everything, this movie was building up for. Call me dark, but I would rather see, the bitter ending of seeing the phone information get delete & reborn, than this sorry forced happy go lucky ending. The idea that, Alex is able to stop the Factory Reset process mid-way & keep a broken troublesome phone, full of bugs, viruses & bots, even if it is ruining his life, because of one good glitch message seem a bit unrealistic. It's clear, by this movie that, the writers have no idea, how smartphone honestly works. I guess, they also never heard of emoji conveying more than one emotion; which they can do, in real life. Simple put it, the ending was dumb, and it could had been smarter. Another thing about the story, whether intentional or not, the film feels like a very generic grab bag of elements lifted directly from many other successful animated films from the past few years, such as 2014's 'The Lego Movie' 2015's 'Inside Out' & 2012's 'Wreck It Ralph'. Just without any of those film's emotional insight or subtlety. The short animation film 'Puppy' had more emotional depth than this film. Overall: Despite, the great talents and charisma of its voice cast & alright animation from Sony Animation Studios. The movie feels more like a giant advertisement for phone apps, made obvious by the blatant and shameless product placement like \"Spotify\", \"Twitter\", \"Candy Crush\", and \"Just Dance Now'. Added, the awful marketing with 2017's TV Show, 'Handmaiden Tales' & you got yourself, a horrible movie, not worth watching. Its inability to deliver emotionally or thematically keeps it from ever feeling like a worthwhile experience. This is one movie worth deleting.",

            "content": "I really didn't like this movie. I watched it on a whim, with the idea of, 'It can't be that bad'. Sadly, I was wrong. The movie is from start to finish stupid. It relies on the audiance also being stupid, and eventually a non-sense plot point. It is bad, it is the prime example of lazy, soulless cash grab movies that have no greater goal than making a little more than the cost of production and advertising. The Emoji movie is the blandest meal you can ever have. There is nothing outright offensive, or horrible about it, but that is what makes it even worse, it is... nothing.There is no difference between this movie and glaring at a wall with nothing happening for an hour and a half. The Emoji movie dresses up the fact that nothing happens under this feel good story about being yourself, but they don't realize they also have a glaring contradiction to that narrative in the form of one of the main characters. The Character Jailbreak, I'll touch on that under the cut. The overall message of the movie for Gene, the lead emoji voiced by TJ Miller is this, Be yourself no matter how many people it kills. It is a shitty movie with no thought put into it.It is a bad movie, skip it. It has bad morals, bad values, bad humor, and all around is dumb, dumb dumb dumb. On a more technical level the animation is fine, a bit dry and soulless and too rounded with no real distinction giving it this made by committee feel but that is about as nice as I can be.Overall: 2 out of 10, I don't recommend this movie. It sucks and actively teaches harmful morals and values.Spoiler Stuff\nSo one of the side characters in the movie is a female emoji named Jailbreak, who is an elite hacker and the smartest character in the movie, because of girl power. A girl can have no weaknesses after all in this era of filmmaking. However, that isn't my issue with her, movies are fantasy, characters are allowed to be super humanly gifted, in fact, part of the appeal of movies is seeing people who are good at things, that inspire us to be good at things. My issue with the character of Jailbreak is her 'character arc' if it can be called such a thing.Jailbreak, out of the blue, is revealed to be the missing princess emoji. So she can sing and summon the twitter logo and other such cheesy and stupid things. However, the issue is actually, her arc contradicts the moral the movie is pushing with Gene.Gene has made the choice to be himself pretty much, even if it gets literally everyone in the phone he lives in deleted. You know, be yourself no matter who you kill. Jailbreak however has decided to rebel completely against the identity she was assigned, Princess, until it was convenient to be a princess, then she was one. It is kind of a BS cop out just to give her new powers. She does go back to being the cool hacker princess in the end, but for the time she is doing princess stuff, it is on surface level the rejection of the shitty moral the rest of the movie pushes.Now the idea of the message, be yourself is fine, kids should hear messages close to that, however... In the context of this movie, Be yourself means killing everyone you have ever known. Being yourself means ruining the lives of everyone around you. I'm not advocating for conformity necessarily, but the movie having a nice wrap up where everything works out including the reversal of what we are told is permanent deletion at the Phone store, is stupid. The message of Be Yourself always needs the caveat of, there are consequences, there are downsides to non-conformity, and you have to make the message that, it is a struggle to find yourself but is also about compromising with the status quo, the society.After all, aren't most murders just being themselves?",

The fact that the movie centers on the \"\ud83d\ude15\" emoji is, in a way, kind of ironic. \"\ud83d\ude15,\" is quite literally the best thing you can say about this movie. The worst you can say, is it made this reviewer want to \ud83e\udd22.The (ugh) Emoji Movie follows a few days in the life of Gene Meh (Miller), an Emoji who for some reason doesn't have the ability to do a \"Meh\" on cue. As a result of a first day screw up, Gene becomes a social pariah and risks deletion unless he can find a code that will change his programming for the better...I guess. Along for the ride is former user favorite High-Five (Corden), and the mysterious Hacker named Jailbreak (Farris) who isn't who she says she is but her big, third act reveal means little, and does little other than prop up a cynical Twitter ad.To the surprise of absolutely no one, The Emoji Movie is chalked full of low-hanging fruit when it comes to jokes and basic story elements. But what is surprising is there's so little of anything actually going on. For real though! In between page long exposition dumps, plot contrivance dumps and forced, cringe-worthy youth-oriented vocab dumps, the jokes seem to be spewing at 30% capacity and the plot seems barely alive. It's essentially a movie of surface level dynamics and empty space.What little we have to grab onto in this godforsaken movie is Meh's ambiguously set up heroes journey. A journey that literally takes him, his friends and his family through Facebook, Youtube, Spotify and Dropbox because, you know, what's a movie like this without cat videos, malware updates, bad pop music and \"thumbs up\" stickers. There's also a trek through Candy Crush which not only feels uninspired but does the unthinkable in taking a beat to actually explain the game lest someone in the audience still holds onto their rotary. It all reaches peak stupidity when Meh manages to travel to \"the cloud\" thanks largely to his ability to make faces and remember the name of the girl the phone's user is obsessed with.The final act makes no sense but trust me, by the point Meh makes his return to Textopolis (no joke, the Emojis live in Textopolis), the movie is so far gone, you'll just be glad it's a few minutes from wrapping up. When it finally does wrap up the only question you'll probably be asking yourself is, \"am I angry that I saw this movie, or am I just angry that it wasted my time?\" With a threadbare story and failing significantly to reach already low expectations, The Emoji Movie is arguably the worst movie of the summer. And this is the same summer that brought us the The Mummy (2017) and that's say something! Everything it does has been done before and better, and what it manages to do differently is so cynically implemented and poorly thought out. This isn't a movie, it's a tweet that's grown sentient.",

Shoutout to the animation team for at least trying to make this movie have any redeeming qualities.\n-There is like, two or three good ideasCons:\n-Even without all of the other cons, this movie would've still been a predictable, unoriginal, cliched, boring, and forgettable piece of (poop emoji)\n-The writing is INFURIATINGLY awful. I had to pause the movie so many times to let the stupidity sink in.\n-The \"jokes\", if you can call them that, are all either bad visual gags or awful \"puns\" that don't even make sense half of the time. There were a few times when I was a little close to laughing, and two times when I genuinely laughed, but the rest of it is garbage.\n-This movie has some of the worst product placement I have ever seen. They weren't trying to be even a little subtle, it just felt like I was watching a big ad for a bunch of apps, with an awful movie in between the ads.\n-The characters are bad. Gene is just an uninteresting \"meh\" protagonist. High-five is very annoying, and I don't buy his friendship with Gene at all. He just seemed to tag along on the adventure for his own personal gain that I didn't care about. Jailbreak is a somewhat boring character who randomly spouts out feminist remarks from time to time, and does some EXTREMELY out of character things near the end of the movie. Again, I don't buy her relationship with Gene, but at least it isn't the most forced in relationship I've ever seen.\n-This movie doesn't seem to have rules. Here are some examples (minor spoilers):\n\"He is going to go to the phone store to delete us tomorrow!\" After what seems like a few minutes in the movie's time: \"We only have 4 hours before the phone is deleted!\"\n\"We have to travel to the other side of the phone to get to the trash to save High Five from being deleted!\" Later: \"Here, I can pull up this email you found and left in the trash on my screen.\"\nNot to mention, a large amount of things that happen in the movie are just not how phones work at all. Also, many plot holes and things that didn't make sense were created just to throw in more ads.\n-There were some subplots, but I din't care at all about them. At least they were breaks from the infuriating main plot\n-The voice acting is sub-standardI know there are worse movies out there, but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't watch this ad that is calling itself a movie. It is not so bad it's good, it's just infuriating, and it will be forgotten within a year or two.",

I doubt that's true, but I have a feeling they're not going to be posting any happy emojis when they see how audiences are reacting to this disappointing movie.Unfortunately, It appears to be a blatant money grab, as well as a copycat of Pixar's successful movie Inside Out (Theatrical). Based on the idea that high schooler's lives revolve around cell phones, the animated emojis live in a colorful, nonsensical world called Textropolis. In fact, the narrator (Meh) exclaims cell phones as the \"most important invention in the history of communication.\" Ummm...no. I love using emojis too, but I love language even more...and real human interaction.Uplifting theme: Individuality, express yourself \"Being #1 doesn't matter if there aren't any other numbers.\" \u2013 Meh, Jail Break \"I'd rather have a real friend.\" \u2013 Meh, hand It's OK to have a lot of different emotions. Friendship, loyaltyThings I liked: The talented voice cast includes T.J. Miller, James Corden, Anna Faris, Maya Rudolph, Steven Wright, Jennifer Coolidge, Christina Aguilera, and Sofia Vergara. Can you believe Patrick Stewart plays \"Poop\"?! Good music. The parents of \"Meh\" talk in monotone, which is pretty funny, especially when you recognize comedian Steven Wright's voice who is absolutely perfect for his role. The YouTube video of the kitten getting tickled got more reaction out of the audience than anything else in the entire movie. Tons of poop jokes. Who doesn't love the poop emoji? Some movie critics are using it to describe this movie. The poop emojis are in a lot of scenes and easy to write gags for. I thought it was cute when the young poop followed his dad out of the bathroom with toilet paper stuck on his foot. There's a quick look at WeChat, which Meh describes as \"a whole other world.\" That's for sure. I've been to China twice this year and have been completely amazed with WeChat. You can invite a friend out to dinner, make a reservation at a restaurant, call a taxi service to take you there, pay for dinner, and all without ever leaving the app. You can even pay for vending machines, go shopping, shake your cell phone to win prizes, and soooooo much more, all on WeChat. It's like all of America's apps built into one. When you see The Emoji Movie in the movie theater, you'll also get to see the animated short called \"Puppy\", based on the characters from Hotel Transylvania.Things I didn't like: Really dumb script and plot. It's just not funny. When I arrived in the theater, kids were bouncing out of their seats with excitement. Once the movie started, they became almost comatose. Predictable, obligatory dance number at the end of the movie that fell flat.Funny lines: \"My mom just joined Facebook. Can you believe she wanted to friend me?\" \u2013 school girl \"We're number two! We're number two!\" \u2013 poop emojis \"What could a teenage boy possibly want to hide from his parents?\" - Meh (T.J. Miller)Dumb lines: \"We have business to attend to.\" \u2013 monkey emojis \"What kind?\" \u2013 Meh \"Monkey business!\" \u2013 monkey emojis \"Words aren't cool.\" \u2013 boy's friend' \"That's what matters in life: popularity.\" \u2013 High 5 (James Corden) Tips for parents: Your kids deserve a better movie. Talk of piracy, skins, and a ton of social media programs.MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",

            "content": "Hollywood is running out of ideas. How would a movie about emojis be good? The whole idea just seemed terrible and uncreative. And they probably couldn't think of any good story to come out of EMOJIS so they decided to take Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out, mix them up in a blender, and came out with The Emoji Movie.This movie opens up with 13-year-olds walking around looking at their phone all the time because hey, that's what 13 year olds are obsessing over these days. But this movie just paints every single 13 year old kid as a phone-obsessed geek but coming from a sheltered person, I know that's not true. I'm sure nobody has their whole entire life revolve around their phone.The characters are one-dimensional and typical. You got hi-five, the happy, hyper emoji, Jailbreak, the emo emoji, Alex, the love interest who's shy and giddy around his girlfriend, ew Poopdaddy emoji, and Gene, the expressive emoji who just wants to be like the other emojis and make a meh expression. And of course, you got two emojis falling in love. A lot of the characters in this movie are douchebaagsA lot of the things in this movie did not make sense and are stupid that I could nit-pick but there is too many to list. I did crack a smile or chuckle at like a few parts but a lot of the jokes are either corny or ridiculous.The only good thing I would say about this movie is the animation is pretty decent. The characters look cute and charming and the voice acting was pretty good except Maya Rudolph always sounded like she had her mouth hanging open.Who are the people that made this movie? It's like a very young child wrote this. I imagine kids under 11 would probably like this but I don't think older kids will.Verdict: Just a terrible cash-grab that's loud and full of pop culture. This movie is essentially unoriginal.",

Did the makers assume we would not notice that The Emoji Movie is one giant advertisement? Because that is all this movie is. Two tutorials on how to play games, and many demonstrations of how great phone's apps are. I wasted an hour and thirty-one minutes on my life watching this, when I would much rather have been sitting bored at home.The plot was messy and stupid, containing one pathetic joke after the next. The trailer was more entertaining. I will not be surprised if next year, a fidget spinner movie is released.This is also offensive to high-school aged students, as the beginning literally states that as a high-school student, Alex's entire life revolves around his phone. Another thing about that is that all they do 24/7 is text, and all they seem to use are emojis. Are the script-writers saying that all a high-school student does throughout the course of their day is press little icons on his phone to send to others?Why did people fight over creating this monstrosity? People in the year 3017 are going to look back on July 18, 2017 as the year humanity was at its lowest pitfall.

I guess Toy Story sucks then, because there's a Slinky Dog and a Mr. Potato Head, and a few mentions of Mattel and Nintendo. Or because of the DeLorean, Back to the Future is the worst movie in existence, along with Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, cause that has Nikes in it. Except none of those films suck at all.

You can genuinely feel the character's emotions inside of you as if you were there. The seemingly confusing concept of three simultaneous stories that have little correlation to each other only creates a huge wave of creativity within the writer's room. This is easily visible by the many heart-warming and saddening scenes within \"The Emoji Movie\". A scene brimming with emotions was presented to us with the subtle yet moving \"Candy Crush\" mobile application. The story's prime protagonist, Gene, is stuck inside the game. However, because his friend, Hi-5, resembles the architecture of a human hand, he is able to bamboozle the game in order to free his chum, Gene. This supposedly insignificant scene portrays a tale of true friendship and belief. Hi-5 was willing to accept his characteristics, and felt great to be himself.",

It doesn't hurt to hear the message that this movie showcases once again as it is actually relevant.\nAnd while it is predictable it also is entertaining enough to keep you interested. Though, if you don't like the plot, give it a shot for the music.

As a 12th grader, I think this is really offensive to other High-Schoolers, people basically think that all High school kids do is mindlessly text, not pay attention in class and play with our phones, and act like slaves to technology to the point where we act brainless and fail everything in life...thus why adults are labeling us as parasitic, childish, dependent millennials True, we may text and go on social media, but we are not hooked to the point of completely ignoring school as a whole....We do not live lives completely revolved around our phone...That's just an offensive stereotype...\ufeff The movie itself is also VERY confusing, the Animation is passable, Voice are Fine, but I could not understand any of the movie, I get the whole \"Express Yourself how you want to\" message, but Emojis are NOT an ideal subject to use this message with since all emojis have a single task and having 1 emoji have a multiple emotions and wants to change and express himself...it just doesn't comprehend...Heck, It would be better if they used Play-Doh and made a Play-Doh Movie, at least it would MAKE SENSE FOR THE EXPRESS YOURSELF MESSAGE!!! In short, this movie is a bad influence for kids, offensive to high-schoolers, and confusing to the point of not even bothering to see anymore of it I was lucky to actually make it through the film without getting angry at the blatant product placements and teen stereotypes...Overall, I cannot forgive this movie, and it deserves the 0% on Rotten Tomatoes...Admit it Sony, you've flopped again!!",

            "content": "\"The Emoji Movie\" is Hollywood's next attempt to make anything a \"thing.\" The Emoji movie is about a meh emoji who may have a malfunction and some other stuff happens along the way. I don't really know. And I don't really care.The thing with animated movies is that you have to make them appealing to both kids and adults. This was neither. Adults will be bored with it, but at least kids will have fun right? Wrong. When the kid next to me is asleep a half hour into the movie and the girl in front of me leans over to her mother and asks \"Mom is the movie over yet,\" that is a problem within itself. There are so many bad attempts at humor in this film. The \"poop emoji\" is there for the poop jokes and there are other characters that have bad puns. Apparently this is what quailifies as humor now. It wasn't funny. I didn't laugh once throughout the entirety of the runtime. And the second half of this film is just a music video. Song after song plays, you see emojis dancing, and the movie stops taking itself seriously. Not like it ever did in the first place anyways. I just never thought a movie would be dumb enough to make it self a music video again after Suicide Squad did that.This movie loses your interest almost immediately. Movies like this have to be fun, entertaining, and interesting. There were so many scenes in this film where I was drifting off thinking about my next day's activities.This is worse than Transformers 5. Sadly almost as bad as Fifty Shades Darker.I am going to give \"The Emoji Movie\" a fat F, which is equivalent to the Poop emoji.Check out my review here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXA2cj6_bnw&t=1s",

            "content": "Most people would be surprised to learn how much more there is to the emoji phenomenon than little digital icons which we use to express emotion or represent activities or locations in our text messages. For instance, did you know that the word emoji has nothing to do with the words emotion or emoticon? Emoji is a combination of the Japanese words for \"picture\" and \"character\". Emojis started appearing on Japanese cell phones in the late 1990s. When they began showing up in the U.S. on the Apple iPhone in 2011, soon followed by other smart phones, emojis truly became a global phenomenon. So much so that there's even an annual World Emoji Day \u2013 and an international organization which regulates emojis!July 17th is World Emoji Day because that's the date the calendar emoji shows, but every day is emoji day for the non-profit Unicode Consortium. According to a July 16, 2017 \"USA Today\" article, \"The Unicode Emoji Subcommittee determines which characters will become part of the official emoji lexicon, creating a uniform code that can be used across platforms.\" The article also says that the consortium, which has been around since 1988, is striving to be more inclusive and representative when it comes to race, gender and sexual orientation, pointing out that, at press time, there were 2,666 approved emojis.Of course, the business and regulatory aspects of emojis don't matter to the people who send the 6 billion emoji-enhanced text messages worldwide every single day. They're just looking for a more complete way to express themselves digitally, to add a little emotional context to their messages. More than just being \"cute\", emojis help us communicate more effectively in our increasingly digital world. And with emojis increasingly prevalent in our daily text messages and Emails, is it any wonder that they would make their way onto movie screens too? And we get just that with the animated adventure comedy \"The Emoji Movie\" (PG, 1:26) bringing to \"life\" those little yellow faces and other digitized objects in the summer of 2017, less than two weeks after the 4th (yes, 4th) annual World Emoji Day.Alex (voiced by Jake T. Austin from the Disney Channel's \"Wizards of Waverly Place\") is a typical teenager. He doesn't like school, but he does like a girl in his school, a pretty young lady named Addie (Tati Gabrielle). Of course, he tries to communicate with her through his smart phone, but he finds it difficult \u2013 because he's shy, but also because his phone seems to have a mind of its own these days. Little does Alex know, but inside his phone is a virtual city called Textopolis, which is where emojis live and work. The job of all the emojis is to stand by for Alex to call upon them in a text message and, when chosen, to present their best individual image as he or she is scanned for a digital text transmission.Gene (T.J. Miller) is excited and nervous because this is his first day on the job as an emoji \u2013 the \"meh\" emoji. His parents, Mr. & Mrs. Meh (Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge), aren't sure he's ready, but he assures them that he is and he takes his position in his cube, waiting to be chosen to appear in a text message. When Alex chooses the meh emoji for a text to Addie, Gene freaks out during his scan, causing Alex to embarrass himself by sending Addie a very odd-looking emoji that she doesn't understand. Gene's mistake causes Smiler (Maya Rudolph), the head emoji, to label Gene a \"malfunction\" and order that he be deleted. Gene makes a run for it and Smiler sends menacing black bots after him.Gene's \"problem\" is that he feels and expresses more emotions than meh. Now, besides being frustrated that he can't just be the meh that he was born to be, he has endangered the entire emoji community. If Alex thinks there's something wrong with his phone, he may just have it wiped clean. Hoping to get \"fixed\", Gene teams up with the hand emoji Hi-5 (James Corden), who is upset that he's no longer in the Favorites Lounge, and the two of them go in search of a hacker named Jailbreak (Anna Faris). Jailbreak is uninterested in helping them until she sees that Gene can show multiple emotions. She decides to help them get to a magical place called The Cloud where all of them may find the solutions to their problems. As the three emojis work their way through Alex's phone (while trying to steer clear of the bots), they cause various apps to malfunction, making even more problems for Alex.\"The Emoji Movie\" is derivative and not very enjoyable. The story, directed and co-written by Tony Leondis (\"Lilo & Stitch: Stitch Has a Glitch\") is a combination of \"Inside Out\", \"Toy Story\", \"Divergent\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\", but not nearly as good as any of them. The script finds many opportunities for humor in actual cell phone usage and the emojis that \"live\" in them, but the movie just isn't all that funny. There are positive lessons about the bonds of friendship and being the best version of yourself regardless of what others think, but those ideas have been portrayed more effectively by countless other movies before this one. \"The Emoji Movie\" is clever enough, but entertaining? Not enough. \"C\"",

Gene, due to be deleted, escapes in the company of Hi-5 and Jailbreak, to try to get Gene reprogrammed.This CGI feature has come in for some fairly savage criticism, not all of which is fair. There is some excellent voice casting (headed by TJ Miller, who specialises in playing Protagonist's Annoying Idiot Friend: he is quite good here), some pleasing visual imagination, some smart riffing on mobile phone apps, textspeak. Youth culture and the like (Hi-5 has fallen out of favour following the rise of Fist Bump, for instance), and a little bit of heart.But that plays against the fact that the film scoffs at youngsters' dependence on mobile phones, then unironically bases itself rather triumphally on that very point. And while the film gives every appearance of aiming itself at children, a lot of the content is at a level where it will be understood and appreciated by teenagers/young adults, who will otherwise feel that the film falls well below the sort of film they shouud be enjoying - \"This is too young and too childish for me.\"Mind you, you have to love a film where Sir Patrick Stewart plays Poop, don't you?",

I'm concerned that by calling this a garbage fire, I'll be doing an injustice to garbage fires. This movie sounded like an inane idea when announced, looked terrible in the trailers, nonetheless surprised me by being worse than I expected. If you can envision a place where creativity goes to die this is it. It represents all the worst elements of Sony as a studio and of Hollywood in general.Remember \"Inside Out\" from a couple of years ago? Did you ever imagine what it would be like if that movie replaced all it's imagination with product placement? That's \"The Emoji Movie\" in a nutshell: \"Inside Out\" sans soul.Our main character, Gene (T.J. Miller),is the son of two \"meh\" emojis (Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge) and he too is meant to be a \"meh\". Sadly,if this movie were \"meh\" it would be a vast improvement. He's not a very good \"meh\" and expresses pretty much every emotion except \"meh\". Because of this, the smiley in charge decides he should be deleted. To escape, he runs off into other phone apps. Remember all the interesting locations the character went through in \"Inside Out\", well here each of those locations is nothing more than a product placement. Gene and Hi-5 (James Corden), who gets caught up in the \"adventure\", go to Let's Dance, Candy Crush, Spotify, YouTube, all in an attempt to get to the cloud aka Dropbox. These side quests exist solely to sell products. Sony outpaces other studios in its use of product placement and cross promotion. Thus, \"The Emoji Movie\" serves as a vehicle for Sony Products and nothing more. Honestly, with all the advertisers featured in this movie it probably paid for itself before one film cell existed.I would say the story is bland and predictable, but in truth it's borderline nonexistent. I wouldn't say it's predictable because that would require an interest in the story's future events when I had none. Literally, I could find nothing to praiseworthy about this movie. Even Patrick Stewart as the Poop emoji never had a chance. What was supposed to pass as humor fell flat. Even when journeying to the separate app, the film's lack of creativity overwhelms everything else. To date, \"The Emoji Movie\" is the frontrunner for worst movie of the year.",

            "content": "'THE EMOJI MOVIE': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A computer animated kids movie about a world of living emoji symbols, where a 'meh symbol' malfunctions and is hunted down to be deleted. The film stars the voices of T.J. Miller, James Corden, Anna Faris, Maya Rudolph, Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge. It was directed by Tony Leondis, and it was written by Leondis, Eric Siegel and Mike White. The movie has received almost unanimously negative reviews from critics and film fans alike (on IMDb at least), but it did do well at the Box Office still (kids seem to like it). I found it to be pretty pointless, and not really humorous at all, but it's not as bad as the reviews make it out to be either.The story is set in Textopolis; a digital city of emojis that all live inside the phone of a teenager named Alex (Jake T. Austin). Gene (Miller) is a meh symbol, who has the special ability to make many different expressions. On his first day of work, Gene panics and makes the wrong expression. This causes Alex to lose faith in his phone, and it puts all of Textopolis in danger. The leader of the text center, a smiley named Smiler (Rudolph), decides that Gene is a malfunction and she orders him to be deleted. Gene flees, with the help of a once popular emoji named Hi-5 (Corden), who's now lost his fame, and a hacker named Jailbreak (Faris). Smiler sends bots after them to delete Gene.The movie seems like a decent enough kids' flick; it's colorful, adventuresome and mildly amusing (the voice cast does decent enough work too). I of course wasn't entertained by it, but of course the movie wasn't made for me obviously. Kids seem to like it, so it's hard to claim that it's a horrible film. There's not much of anything in there for adults though, and it definitely doesn't have anything of substantial value to teach children. So I'd say it's an OK kids flick at best, that's definitely nothing special (that's for sure).",

There is no emotional connection to any character whatsoever...only whimsical spikes of interest here and there. The script is bland and at times cringy. There is no emotional connection BETWEEN the characters (this is a problem because emojis represent...ah-hem...emotions) and to top it off, it feels second-hand in a very sour way.This movie is a BOMB as far as quality, but I think a 0.5/4 will suffice due to the fun I had laughing at it.

But that's OK, that's actually how it relates to the audience that know each app on our smartphone, and you use them everyday. And that's actually what makes it interesting and compelling. How could a movie about your phone be with fake names and fake apps, it wouldn't make sense.However, the action felt like they were just passing each level, from one app to the other until the final destination. And it's not that funny, but it has some nice funny lines that make you smile (but not laugh). My kid laughed a bit with the easy jokes. Positive points for the animation, liked the Instagram bit especially for the really nice 3D feel.Despicable Me 3 is funnier. Cars 3 is more adventurous.

I found the antagonist actually pretty creepy, as are all perpetually happy people.Ultimately I came away feeling warmly about the movie for it's rich, distinctive world, positive message and how it embodies an aspect of its time while tying it to a universal them even if it's not exactly subtle about it.",

And I read the synopsis which promised a nice and funny premise. But then, at its release day here in Mexico, I found out because of a meme (yes, really) something strange about it: its terrible and crappy ratings and reviews at Rotten Tomatoes and also here in IMDb. I mean, I have seen lots of good films that have a 4 or even a 3 as rating, but 1.5 was...a bit too much for me.And well, despite of knowing that I probably was going to see a real piece of sh*t of movie, I took my seat throwing to the trash for a while all the bad things that everyone was saying about 'The emoji movie'. And yes, I saw the probable reasons why to hate this movie, particularly two of them: one, it was at times a bit slow; and two, the jokes were at times silly and unfunny, especially for one of the main audiences this movie was meant to be directed: teens. Because all the things we teens consider funny nowadays contain bad words, and as this movie is meant also for children, that includes the jokes which, at least I as a teenager, felt them a bit old-fashioned.But anyway, I don't really think it deserved such harsh ratings, as there have been worse movies of its type, and, believe it or not, it is funny and entertaining at times, and the emojis made the experience worthwhile for me. In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this one as one of the best animated movies of the year, but anyway, I would suggest you that, if you want to see it, do it, but not with very high expectations, but still, without reading the bad reviews.

The graphics are beautiful, and the voice acting is spectacular. The music isn't the best, but it's still decent. They got great animators, actors, and composers to make this movie. So why was it so bad? In a word, the writers. I don't know what the people who scripted this thing were thinking. The plot is just so terrible, there are no words. The main issue with the plot is how utterly cliche it is. If you think about it, this movie is basically the Lego Movie, but with all the minifigures replaced by emojis. The Lego movie really was a good movie, but this movie stole it's plot, removed all the exciting scenes, severely diluted the antagonist, and basically turned it into garbage.Occasionally, the movie will throw in a good joke. Some of them are actually pretty funny and witty. That's the main upside. If nothing else, it will occasionally make you laugh.But all of that aside, as a hardcore fan of Michael Jackson, there is one element of this movie that I do find offensive: Hi-Five claiming he can dance as good as \"Michael\" and putting on a Smooth Criminal Style fedora, then immediately proceeding to dance terribly. As a fan of Michael Jackson, I hate this scene for that one reason.",

            "content": "Ever since The Lego Movie was made, I've taken it upon myself to be open to more ideas that sound like cash grabs, but could also be more. The Lego Movie sounded like a giant commercial for the toy company. Instead, it was smart tribute to the creativity it inspires and was very funny. That has made me realize that out of everything, storytelling can allow anything to be engaging if people can emotionally connect with it enough. If people could find that connection with a bunch of toys and bricks, whose to say that the same thing could be found with emojis?Most people with smartphones have used an emoji at some point. I myself like the ones that either engage laughter or show off that I'm trying to convey something smooth. While I have no problem using it every once and a while, I dislike it when it becomes the prominent way of communication. I haven't asked any teenagers about that, but I'm sure that most of them still need text to order specific food or to tell their parents that their out until midnight. I like the think that all teens are smart, but The Emoji Movie makes them an unsalable group. In the smartphone of high schooler Alex (played by Jake T. Austin), is where all the emojis live where they live and work a part of the texting app. Meh emojis Mel (played by Steven Wright) and Mary (played by Jennifer Coolidge) are about their see their son Gene (played by T.J. Miller) go off to be used in his first text. Gene seems to have the ability to show other expressions and that happens when his text goes wrong. The leader of the emojis Smiler (played by Maya Rudolph) talks with other emojis like the Devil Emoji (played by Sean Hayes), dancer emoji (played by Sofia Vergara) and Poop emoji (played by Patrick Stewart) about what to do.When Gene gets word that he is likely to be deleted, he escapes with the hand emoji, HI-5 (played by James Cordon). Upon leaving the texting app, he finds a jailbreak emoji (played by Anna Faris) who tells him that if they can get to the Icloud, then his source code can be fixed. From there, they go through several apps including Candy Crush, Instagram, Just Dance, and more while everybody learns about being themselves...or something like that.Sony pictures should be ashamed. The Emoji Movie has to be one of the most obvious product plug movies ever made. I thought The Internship (the movie about Google) was bad, but this sets a new record. Not only do the story rip off Wreck it Ralph, Inside Out and The Lego Movie, but several times, the plot just stops to make another advertisement. If anything, I felt like I just sat through an introduction for a cult; a cult that clearly does not understand how teenagers, computers, programs, apps, games, and emotional storytelling work. Even for it's obnoxious tie ins, how are the characters? As hard as the majority of these actors try, this script does everything to suck out anything funny or interesting. This is more then a bad movie; this is a black mark on a resume that is likely to hurt every single person involved. I cannot remember anytime that I laughed, nor even heard a chuckle from the kids in my theater. I can only imagine that the parents that took their kids to this were punishing them. I wouldn't have been that cruel to my own. This is a movie that simply appeals to no one (it's too adult for kids and too stupid for the teenage audience they would have been the better targeted crowd).Is the animation even worth noting? Even that suffers from the story. Because the majority of the emojis are necessarily bright for their use, this doesn't allow them to pop out. It's just a mess of pixilation and phone advertisements. This kind of movie makes me mad that millions of dollars are spent making this garbage over original stories that aspiring artists are trying to pitch.I'll give this one poop emojis out of five. This movie doesn't even deserve a formal ending, so I'll end it on this: Shame on you Sony Shame on you Sony Shame on you Sony Shame on you Sony",

But now I have started to see that the cute innovation in e-communication, those emojis, have already crept into some submitted user reviews now (and I would state that I'm guilty of dropping ASCII ideograms/emoticons in reviews;) so I have no complaints there, that made me actually quite glad, but I'm kind of bothered about that at the same time. I find those things cute and consider it useful in spicing up whatever thought I'm trying to express, or lines of emojis such as this:\ud83c\udf74\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfa5is kind of struggle in squeezing enough brain juice to assemble that. A different language altogether. Perhaps I'm already to just too old for head to rewire new neural connections to be just as quick on my feet as the kids nowadays when it comes to those things. Talk about generational gap. Or I better leave such things for emojilogists to decipher. But using such for adornment, I find it quite fun, which kind of made me think of a modest proposal that maybe the IMDb crowd might one day consider. Perhaps by alloting a separate space in their website, or one could call it a shrine a corner in the webpage where people can sort of attribute what emoji would most describe their experience in having watched the film/movie in a more playful and colorful manner to complement the existing numeric rating (which is useful in sorting, or in giving a perspective of how a film stacks up against other films/movie made), those smiley face, crying face or poop emoji (that is if that would not be regarded as an unaccepable) will kind of give audience a chance to express their feelings or warning people of what they could expect about the film/movie. But perhaps imposing a three-emoji maximum would do for such a thing, which will then be displayed in a part of a the webpage, or a separate page with the frequently used ones ending up bigger than the lesser-used emojis, the same way some websites highlight the frequently used keywords by presenting them in bigger or slightly bigger fonts than the other lesser used ones. And those people who have difficulty in filling up the 50-character minimum requirement for posting reviews could knock themselves out in such a space, a place that will perhaps give a glance of what would turn out to be like one of those mini-Bruegel painting made of different emojis.I am aware that the GetSatisafaction message site is the more appropriate place for leaving such suggestions, but mine is not really a pressing matter. I'm just rambling and just compensating for having not much good to say about this movie.For a film that professes a moral that one should embrace their multidimentionality instead of hiding it, which is always a good thing, they sure used the wrong subject to proclaim that. Even though what ends up becoming as a well-intentioned, satisfactory CG-animated movie that's overflowing with kawaii appeal, and gives one a snapshot of tech/cyber landscape nowadays that perhaps in a few years time reach its obselescence, and a public bathroom scene with Gene and his parents which I find quite hysterical (one-layered humor where one doesn't need to wear a thinking caps to process it), and the variety of outstanding voice talents asked to participate in the film that includes comedian Steven Wright, a spot-on on being cast as Gene Meh's dad, all of that really was not enough to really redeem this movie. And I know it's easy to pick on an criticize a Razzie-awarded flick, but I just have to agree with them on that, because using a story of a rogue emoji, programmed to do a certain task and does something else, really just makes the main protagonist look more like an aberration.My rating: \ud83e\udd8a-trot.",

The obvious message in the film is that technology connects people together, so buy an iPhone and text an emoji to show your love for another. Hearing that flimsy and gimmicky moral, I saw The Emoji Movie as a 90-minute commercial for Sony products, with all the features installed such as a half-baked story, uninspired characters, and obnoxious puns, but colorful imaginative worlds. As for Alex, the phone's owner who sends a text to let go of his comfort zone, he is no Riley from Inside Out. The boy is just as dreadfully boring as all the other phone-ridden schoolmates, including his girl crush, and the apps and emojis don't do much to support his character arc. Also, the film missed an opportunity to have the emojis escape the phone world and enter the WiFi network, where they might accidentally damage the system causing chaos in not just the school but the world. This could have been a unique children's satire tackling the impact of technology among humans. However, The Emoji Movie and Sony exist to only advertise trendy electronics rather than glorifying the art of cinema. (1 \u00bd Thumbs Down Symbols out of 5)",

Gene makes friends with Hi-5, together they go to the troll bar and meets the hacker named Jailbreak. Together they have adventures in the game Candy Crush and play in the Just Dance app game, they also surf the Internet to get to the dumpster to save their friend Hi-5, finally they run into the Firewall and Gene struggles to get access granted to Dropbox, Gene has doubts about changing himself and doesn't go though with it. Then Gene gets kidnapped by robots. Genes parents distract the anti-virus robots with youtube cat videos. Then Gene is saved from deletion, but Alex starts deleting the Emoji's world and Gene quickly makes different faces and Alex's girlfriend is impressed and Alex quickly cancels the deletion and the world goes back to normal.I liked this movie very much, the jokes were funny even better than Wreck-it-Ralph 2, I liked the worlds the Emojis surfed in, the twitter bird was funny, I liked how Genes parents distracted the robots with youtube cat videos, I also liked the devil emoji, the monkey emojis, the poop emoji, the little baby strawberries. I liked how the buildings were colorful and creative, I liked the trolls in the bar, the annoying spam letter woman, I liked Candy Crush, Just Dance with the just dance girl character. Anyways it was the funniest animated movie I've ever seen next to Wreck-it-Ralph and The Lego Movie.If any of you imdb users disagree with me, well then tough, I like the Emoji Movie, I will disagree with the users that didn't like this movie, I did however hated the movie Peter Rabbit Sony company made a year later in 2018, but that's in a different review. Anyways please give this funny animated movie a chance, it was an original movie that worked in every way that made it funny throughout the entire film. Yes this is an 86 minute advertisement but it was better than Wreck-it-Ralph 2 because they had more funny jokes.I would've liked the Sony Company to explore the cellphone addiction the human characters had, especially Alex I would've been interested in the negative consequences that it has on Alex's life.Yes this is rated PG and a little crude humor but it's funny to watch.",

This film does in no way warrant the hate reviews that it has been receiving as of late. It's aimed at a YOUNGER, easier-to-please sugar-crazed crowd of little tweens, and to them, I can assure you, this was gold. It's a kids movie. What on earth were you expecting??",

This is almost like a parody movie that you'd find in a Family Guy cutaway or something, not an actual product that should exist on this planet. Hey, have you seen Inside Out and/or Wreck-it Ralph? Good, you got yourself a double feature that you can watch instead of paying money to go see $50 MILLION get set on fire and watch it burn to ashes for 85 minutes. This movie has only one of very, very few redeeming traits, and it is this: ANYONE can get their movie in theaters, regardless of talent, quality, or entertainment value for ages 2 and under; if you throw enough money at it, you too can play the same weekend as Atomic Blonde with the smug attitude of \"Yes, people (with common sense) will see this.\"",

Well, it wasn't, and The Emoji Movie has to be the worst movie I've seen in quite some time. Some kids may find some enjoyment in this movie, but it's all from stupid jokes and seeing their favorite app in an animated movie. I think the biggest issue with this movie is the lesson it is expressing to kids. This movie's lesson is go on your phones and use emojis. That's the legit lesson, I am not kidding. Kids aren't learning anything good when watching this film, so they shouldn't watch it ever. I watched it with friends as a joke, and it actually was fun because we made fun of everything going on in the movie. The plot of this movie is very simple yet dumb, I feel like a seven year old could've made the script of this movie. Just the whole concept of emojis on phones going on an adventure sounds dumb. The Emoji Movie made $217 million at the box office!!! Like, why, what a waste of money. The budget was $50 million, and that money could've been used for a new film maker to make their first theatrical release, or could've been donated to charity. I think that $50 million was a big oof by sony animation. Making the movie was also a waste of time. That time making the movie could've been used to volunteer at a local soup kitchen, or making a better movie. I'd obviously give The Emoji Movie a 1/10.",

Yeah, the plots is a bit predictable and borrows heavily from other kids CGI movies like Wreck it Ralph and other kids fare.

All the product placement didn't bother me (which is what I think a lot of people really don't like) but I'm fine with it since it tends to bring us closer with the real world.

So guess what, they made a movie out of them! Yes, why not, you have a built in product tie in as there are already emoji pillows and such out there. So Sony, makes another huge mistake to go along with making Ghostbusters again and promoting it by attacking its audience, by screwing up Spider-man twice by making two sets of films with no proper endings to either (thankfully, they finally let Marvel help) by making an emoji movie and they make it as bad as one would think a film about pointless symbols can be! Seriously, the story is horrid.The story has emojis living within our phones and they live in an emoji town. They go to their job which is a box where they get scanned and then appear on the phone. What? That is the most absurd crap ever. Why not just emojis living in a city do their thing, why make them be in a phone because we already no they are just data and not creatures living in our phone. Well, one emoji, the 'meh' emoji cannot do 'meh', he can apparently do everything which gets him in trouble with smiley face and soon he is being hunted because the kid whose phone they are on is going to delete his phone. So 'meh' must try to become 'meh' with the help of high five and a hacker. And the studio put money behind this. There are a couple of funny parts to this one, but seriously, it just is not a good film. Studios these days pass by good stories every day for something like this and who can blame them? People pass up films unless it is tied to something these days or a sequel. Seriously, they are making Star Wars films every year now and people get excited to see them. Why not make a film about something that can easily be turned into a toy? Thankfully, this film was not a huge super success, still wondering how the hell this cost 50 million to make. Unfortunately, it did make the studio a profit so I can see a direct to DVD or Netflix sequel coming out. I am sure if there is one it will be even more 'meh'.",

            "review_title": "The one thing relevant in \"The Emoji Movie\" is it's failure, let's examine the industrial accident...",
            "content": "In my \"Top Gun\" review, I said there was nothing wrong with the 'commercial' look of the film since the product placement is the whole setting. I sarcastically added: 'except for the emoji movie'. To be fair, I hadn't seen the movie. Now, I did. Do I withdraw my statement? Nope.But let's face it, criticizing \"The Emoji Movie\" would be like Homer Simpson repetitively hitting the Krusty burglar with that kid crying \"stop it, stop it, he's already dead\". No need to punch the cadaver or shoot the ambulance as French say, \"The Emoji Movie\" achieve one milestone by becoming the first film to win the Worst Picture Razzie... it did so brilliantly that commentators went pretty creative on it (one remembers the Rotten Tomatoes consensus). I'll try to be more constructive.Let's examine the film. First, it's not the 'product placement' that is problematic, besides \"Top Gun\", you have many quality films that couldn't do without brandname-dropping (\"The Social Network\", \"Cast Away\"...). The real insult is that the writers took our 'wow' for granted just because we're having familiar everyday technology on the big screen. Some bits like the Firewall or the Dropbox were okay but did we need that lengthy dancing app sequence? Couldn't have they come up with something more imaginative with at least ONE social network?Some would argue that the real mistake was to make a bland cardboard character out of the young smartphone owner... and that predictable crush no one could care about. I think it's downright impossible to make a deep soul connection between emojis and people \u00e0 la \"Inside Out\" (which it obviously ripped off). It's tough enough to make emojis as relatable as humans but humans are bound to appear as predictable and boring as emojis if they're defined by them. Now, would have the film worked better if it was just about Emojis? You know, like the Smurfs... but how do you make an Emoji movie without their main users?Gosh, must have been one hell of a brainstorming session in that conference room!Now, supposing humans are relegated to supporting players (after all, it did work for the Lego movie) but then how about the Emoji characters? You have a 'Meh' emoji who refuses to be defined by one expression: we got it: MISFIT. You have Jailbreak as the female who doesn't want to be 'categorized' and rejects love, we got it: GIRL POWER. Hi-5 is the comical sidekick, and Patrick Stewart is the prestigious cameo, voicing Poo. And you know what? That's not even the problem.Have a respectable actor voice a poo, and it's an average gag at best. Have him say only poo-related jokes, it kills, annihilates and exterminates the fun. Humor is a matter of contrast, so let's just have a poo behaving like a respectable citizen (did I just write that?) Having the Big Bad as a Smiley was an interesting twist... although nothing new (cough *Joker*). Now, don't get me start on 'Meh' parents, the most tired joke of the film, and the responsible for a puzzlement I never thought I'd have: do emojis reproduce? Do 'Meh's go only with 'Meh's? Are emojis racist? Do a crying and a happy one made a happy tears one?Like another film I reviewed recently, \"The Emoji Movie\" is a film that the more it makes sense, the less it does. The premise is ludicrous though it had potential, the treatment was predictable but exploiting many overused tropes from better movies, the product placements were superficial, the human world didn't make us care and ultimately, it's hard to imagine Emojis as living creatures.Finally, I remembered the way I use my own emojis: my favorite are the Thumbs Up when I want to save myself writing two lines of approval, the kissing heart when I receive pictures of babies... which makes me realize that I hate when I get only emojis as answers. Let's be honest, emojis are semantic loopholes, products of our intellectual laziness and yet the film portrays them as a pillar of the new-age communication. I wouldn't say no one wants to watch a movie to remember how lobotomized we are by these little creatures... but not one that gives a noble dimension to their existence.Now, there's a hidden relevance in the film, something that could have elevated it to the level of social comment, had it dared to have an edge, to end with a moral twist where the boy would win the girl's heart by just talking to her... how about having that message communicated to the climax 'talk to her' or something like that... that the film obviously makes the emojis the alpha and omega of the life of a teenager could only foreshadow its failure. Not to say that there aren't good moments, the animation can please the kiddies on a mindless level, although the graphics might be too overstimulating.Still, I'm glad the film was made because if cinema needs masterpieces, it also needs a few occasional big stinks. Movies like \"Cats\" or \"Batman and Robin\". Movies that reveal how far Hollywood marketing can go in its faith on our mediocrity and how low it can sink for the sake of cash-making flashy idiocy.Cinema needs movies that make audience say \"enough is enough', movies that show that even the lousiest gimmicks are supposed to serve a plot, that kids aren't just dim-witted consumers who'd grab anything just because it's got pretty nice colors.There's a limit to how far you can push the me-toos (I mean the marketing strategy) to emulate dinosaurs, while reality put you back to the state of La Fontaine's frog that wished to be as big as an Ox and so she started puffing herself out and kept doing it more and more. What happened to her is the perfect metaphor for \"The Emoji Movie\" ultimate fate.",

The jokes are shocking, the characters are either bland or mean-spirited, the animation is so poor, the voice work is sluggish and dull, the character designs are lazy, the story and its sub-plots are lazily stolen from other movies, and worst of all... they sacrificed so many good movie ideas to make this shameless money-grabbing ploy.I do not recommend this movie at all, your kids deserve better than a movie like this, even if you rent it, its not worth wasting your money, I wouldn't even take it if it was free.

            "content": "I could justify all the hate this movie gets if it's because Wreck It-Ralph and Inside Out did everything this movie did first. But me and my mom are in the 3% of people who still like this movie. If you kept an open mind for The Lego Movie, you'll probably keep an open mind for this movie as well. Did you know that the movie's slogan at the end of the credits is \"Be Moved?\" This movie succeeded at doing just that for me. Inside Out and Zootopia honestly never made me feel as many emotions as this movie did.This movie is way more overhated than Ghostbusters 2016, not that I found that movie to be abysmal either. I really liked having TJ Miller and Anna Faris and Patrick Stewart in this movie. The only people missing from the voice cast that this movie could have used were if Ashleigh Ball was a fierce fire emoji that sounded like Rainbow Dash and if Andrea Libman was a cheerful party hat that sounded like Pinkie Pie. Maybe they'll be in The Emoji Movie 2! I can't wait for that.Without spoiling any of the plot, I can say that this movie had 1 good message that might have been missing from Inside Out: People in real life don't want to act 1 way all the time, and that's the point of emojis in this film. Gene and Jailbreak are both emojis who want to accomplish the same goal of being an emoji with more than 1 expression, more than 1 character trait. That point was absent in Inside Out because it was just...Joy and Sadness want each other to see things from each other's perspective, but none of the emotion people on their own want to be a different emotion and they are the actual emotions of a person. Since The Emoji Movie takes place in a smart phone that is not connected to the human body and all of the emojis are their own person instead of another person's innate emotions, that gives the plot and characters a little more depth and flexibility to...not just act one way, which is what Dark Knight Court did with Bart and Mr. Burns. Plus, almost every face emoji is the same color, unlike with Inside Out.It's also got the concept of Wreck-It-Ralph of the main character not wanting to be one thing and traveling between different video games or apps. Ralph doesn't just want to be a villain and Gene doesn't just want to be Meh because he has tons of facial expressions, like many good actors do. Maybe that's what made this one of TJ Miller's more interesting roles.So if you still hate this movie, then that's fine, but don't have it come out of nowhere just for the sake of hating a movie based on Emojis. What if you actually like The Lego Movie in spite of it being based on Legos? Let's be real: Would you rather watch this glorious movie about Emojis learning to be well-rounded characters, or Stressed Eric, the torture porn series where the main character always fails, that in itself failed to make British humor work for American audiences?However, if there was anything I had to say in response to why the film is so hated, it's more hated for what it didn't do than what it did do. It really should have done more with Alex instead of having Gene, Hi-5 and Jailbreak going through games most of us already use that they easily could have gone around. I hope The Emoji Movie 2 doesn't insult us this much and has a more interesting plotline. If you had any faith in The Emoji Movie or believed that it could have worked, I would suggest sending a letter to Tony Leondis telling him how he can avoid these problems in case there is an Emoji Movie 2. There may not be a sequel, but it's good to give writing improvement tips anyway. How about making Gene and Hi-5 visit the emojis on Addie's phone?",

            "content": "The universal panning of The Emoji Movie (2017) is not deserved nor is it the worst movie of the year. It is easy to dismiss an animated film that satirises how humans communicate. However, it does raise serious issues; so if you are not interested in hearing a defence of the film, stop reading now.There are a number of levels at which The Emoji Movie can be read. If you expect conventional narrative logic, characterisation, emotional impact, clever script or technical originality, you will inevitably be disappointed. But if you are looking for an imaginative take on today's mass communication culture, it is an interesting film. The animated story unfolds inside the nano-world of a smartphone, amongst the apps populated by emoji. We see 'life' from the viewpoint of Gene who, on his first day in the emoji directory, is deemed dysfunctional because he shows more expression than allowed by his single-dimension 'meh' persona. When the phone-owning teenager selects Gene to send to his girlfriend it causes communication chaos in both human and smartphone worlds. Gene becomes a doomed emoji and must flee Textopolis in search of reprogramming, passing through firewalls and big-name apps like Instagram, Spotify and Twitter. He teams up with another obsolete emoji called Hi 5 and a love interest named Jailbreak, all with deadly bots in hot pursuit while the trio flee for safety in the Cloud. Doomsday approaches when the teenager decides to wipe his phone.OK, OK; you were warned that it is not a conventional film. So, what's the point? One clue is the classroom teacher who explains to cell phone-dependent students that human communication was first recorded using ancient hieroglyphics, a pictographic language similar to an emoji directory. Despite the evolution of written communication over millennia, the use of single-meaning pictographic symbols has exploded. Is this the way of the future? While the film does not answer this question, it does offer an imaginative look into the world of smartphone communication. There is a social class system that groups emoji into favourites, ordinary, and rarely used, and the favourites rule the world with popular one-dimensional messages. Ambivalent or unpopular emoji are publicly persecuted and the trash is the ghetto of the unwanted. The Smiley emoji was the first ever made and it now exerts totalitarian control through a smile that appears happy but can also mask sinister intent. Gender politics rules the emoji and tomboy Jailbreak is really a princess in disguise who is desperately trying to avoid being treated like a girl. In other words, the emoji domain is a perfect mirror of the human world.Nobody is arguing that this is a great film, but it is not a disaster. Decades from now it will be dug up and studied as a whimsical cultural artefact that portrays the imagined relationship between humanity and digital communication. Researchers will ask why hieroglyphics returned as a universal language and why humans came to rely on homogenised icons to convey meaning. If a movie can change the way you see things then it is worthwhile. This writer will never look at emoji in the same way again.",

How much of a base level have we sank to where we've gotten to the stage where Sony thinks we can be entertained by something so basic and pandering.The plot is essentially a rip off of Wreck it Ralph where TJ Miller emoji, Anna Faris emoji and James Corden emoji go off the rails trying to find sanctuary as opposed to their dull existence serving the phone user. The conundrum in the human world is just the phone user stressing out over what emoji to send his crush to win her affections. I'm just there thinking, \"are you actually kidding me?\" How out of touch are these mid-life crisis suffering writers, that they think that the youth of today will relate to something so insultingly simplistic?The product placement of the phone apps such as Twitter, Instagram, Candy Crush, etc. are incredibly on the nose too.

If you think that joke is bad then you'd be right in thinking that I have about as much talent as everyone that worked on this movie. If your child comes and asks you to see this movie don't panic, just follow these simple steps: 1. Retrieve your shotgun 2. Put your child down. There's nothing else that can be done for them. I'm not going to write a real in depth review because this movie does not deserve it, so I'll just paste my notes here: The Good: nothing. Im serious, nothing is good in this movie. Some things are average or done somewhat-competently, like the overall animation, but nothing is actually above average or good.The Bad:-It's soulless -Has no pacing -Has no character development but still tries to force some anyways-Hates millennials, thinks we are dumb and self centered and callous. It also stereotypes us while preaching about not stereotyping women-literally forces feminism into the plot worse than any other film I have ever seen and tries to make princess emojis seem anti-women \"I don't need a man to save me\"a character says #truth literally beats you over the f*cking head about any and everything the boy wins the girl in the end by sending an emoji. This is not a joke or over simplification. This movie literally thinks we communicate solely through emojis -dialogue breaks down into 4 very obvious categories: 1. Sh*tty jokes 2. Forced social commentary 3. Forced and obvious character development 4. Forced and obvious statements meant to move the plot forward it plays the joke about the 'meh emojis saying emotional dialogue without emotions' throughout the whole f*cking film there is seriously no pacing in this film. Scenes just randomly end and go to other scenes for no rhyme or reason. This film basically has the bare minimum when it comes to plot, characters, and jokes This movie was made just for product placement and nothing else-THE BOY LITERALLY WRITES THE LYRICS TO \"shine bright like a diamond\" AS A LOVE NOTE CAUSE DON'T F*CKING FORGET US MILLENNIALS ARE ACTUALLY MENTALLY IMPAIRED they go into Spotify just to plug in certain songs into the f*cking movie. There's absolutely no reason it needed to be in the movie other than that btw guess what the hacker is actually the princess WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED? ITS LITERALLY THE PLOT TO WRECK-IT-RALPH I actually empathized with the villain. Not because I was supposed to, cause you're not, but because the other characters are just so awful. The villain was almost kind of funny at moments, and in truth killing our main emoji dude would have been the only way to save the phone world. Overall she has more of a purpose and more defined goals than any other character in this film. also can we talk about the mid-credits scene. Cause yeah I was so disturbed by what I had seen that I couldn't move from my chair so I sat there until this scene rolled up wait first let me say that Anna Faris or whatever her name is might be the worst voice actress I've ever heard. And by might be, I mean it's not even close OK so the end credits scene directly contradicts the end of the movie. The movie ending has all the characters being accepted into the COOL EMOJIS CLUB I HONESTLY WISH I WAS MAKING THIS SH*T UP. But in the credits scene we see a bunch of the lame emojis and the evil smiley lady in the basement for loser emojis. Like the emoji movie even failed at its message that everyone should be liked/equal or some corny sh*t like that.FINAL MESSAGE: this movie makes the angry birds movie look like a masterpiece. If this movie came out during the cold war, the USSR would show it to its civilians as anti-American propaganda to show how stupid and consumer obsessed we are. If an alien race was to decide the fate of this planet based solely on watching this film, they would no doubt decide to exterminate humanity.",

Finally, an evil corporation that directs the destiny of emojis is challenged to put control of the situation lest something finally get out of control. There are references to multiple applications and programs which would charm someone born in this century. There are a couple of great moments (dancing is one of them) and the movie, whether the perfectionists like it or not, isn't that bad.",

If this same film was released before 'Wreck it Ralf', 'The Lego Movie', 'Pixels', 'Inside Out', then people might have liked it. But now, it is like Sony desperately wanted their version of toys and/or games related film, so they made it. That's how it looks like. Despite all the criticism, the film minted good sum. So it is not a box office flop, only devalued honestly by those who saw it.Those titles I mentioned and this story has the same storyline. Basically, that's very common platform where 80 per cent of the films borrow from. The scenes looked very ordinary, like there's nothing much to explore. The jokes were weaker, the characters were uninteresting in most of the parts. I would say they did not utilise them rightly. The good thing is, it is a watchable film, but the majority won't like it. Usually Sony animations were met with underwhelmingly, and seeing the response it had got, surely there will be no sequel, at least for now.3/10",

Next time, stick with a Popeye movie.Now, this review Is just my rant about how much I wanted it to fail. But if I were to put a REAL review in, it'd be this: This is one of the most clich\u00e9 movies of all time. Its like Sony looked at things like Wreck it Ralph and Finding Dory, and just straight up copied it. But made it worse. The characters are bland, the story is bland, and all the comedy fails.

The jokes made me smile and occasionally laugh a little. It's nowhere near as offensive as it should be to deserve all the negative reviews.

James Corden's character provides some pretty good humor for what we're dealing with here. In the end, Gene finds himself, and gets the girl, or at least the girl emoji. This is not before a few colorful and surprisingly interesting scenes. There is even a little bit of fun to be had for adults, probably for parents if they happen to be watching along with their kids. At one point the whole text-world is about to get deleted and a poo emoji starts punching a fan!\nSome of it's a little hard to process in terms of relating to human-like emojis but I doubt the movie's target audience will care. The end does kind of contradict the premise of the movie to start with but really, I'm an adult, and I'm overthinking this.

If you can make a masterpiece out of; a rat who wants to be a chef (Ratatouille), a penguin who can surf (Surf's up), oh and A PANDA WHO WANTS TO DO MARTIAL ARTS (Kung Fu Panda), you can make a good movie out of just about anything, regardless of who made it. Also, the \"It's just a kids movie\" is just the laziest excuse ever. I personally think that children deserve good movies too, and not just a distraction to gawk and laugh at. The movies I mentioned above can actually be enjoyable for people other than 5 year old's. And no, lovely animation and a 'good message' isn't enough anymore.I will say a few positives, like the animation is amazing, a few jokes got a guilty smile out of me, and I admire Jailbreak's line: \"How can you be number one, if there are no other numbers?\" So, one or two things to enjoy, but just skip it, and show your kids a better movie.",

All the big names like face book and Instagram make an appearance in the film. There were a few big laughs in the movie. It's one of those things where there making fun of one of the apps and if you use that app or understand how it's used than it will give you a chuckle, but man it's so funny how the film is as lackluster as the emoji they picked as the main character.

A lot of that is highly overreactions. I had little to no expectations considering knowing how low its reviews were and knowing some about the basic of the film.With that said, although the movie is predictable and has a story which has been done before (lead character doesn't feel he belongs, so he sets out on a journey for some kind of redemption, meets a love interest along the way, ends in a happy ending), this is a children's film and for the younger crowd, and since they are familiar with these emojis, it's best not to take the film too serious.Overall, the emoji movie isn't nearly as bad as critics and people are claiming, no it's not a great masterpiece but the visuals and colors are nice looking, and there are some creative product placement. Also the film isn't nearly that long to completely drag on. This movie also made quite a lot at the box office ($217 million worldwide), so people must have enjoyed it to some degree.",

That's harsh, even though I don't completely disagree. But I have seen worse things.\nStill, why 2 stars and not 1 or less?\nWell, 1 is for the voicing talent of T.J. Miller. I like the guy. He's what made the Silicon Valley series funny. And here, just hearing his voice, felt comforting. He's like that friend with the cool voice and the interesting stories (true or not) who can talk forever non-stop, but you don't mind because they fill up a void with life. They entertain when you can't be bothered to make an effort. The life of the party when you're happy to take a backseat and just chill whilst nursing your drink. He makes a good buddy.The other 1 star just has to go to the sheer audacity of making a movie about emojis in the first place.\nWhat would Disney and Pixar writers from 20 years ago make of this? Even the writers of the dystopian Wall-E (2008) would have not predicted the dystopian direction of something like The Emoji Movie becoming a reality.\nStill, the pitch to Sony (or Columbia Pictures) would have been easy enough.\n'Emojis come in a variety of expressions,' they would say. 'So many of them. And each of them can be a different character. Then there's all the animals. And body parts. And objects. And... all the other things you can send in a text that isn't a letter. All of those are characters, so the world building is easy peasy.\nAt this point, Sony (or Columbia Pictures) are almost on board. 'But what about the story?' they'd say.\nWell, for the producers, that would be the easiest part. Just take a bit of Inside Out (the behind-the-scenes universe) and a bit of Wreck-it-Ralph adventure, and there you have it. The same old rehashed story told from another perspective. They'd argue that kids and young teens would gobble it up. Seeing their favorite emojis up on the screen would be a thing they never knew they loved, up until that moment.\n'Just think of all the stuffed and plastic emoji toys that could follow after the movie's success,' they'd say.It was a gutsy move. Especially that it was a move made by grown-up responsible adults. Serious people talked about this in conference meetings and studio discussions and writer/animator sessions.Maybe the whole thing was a dare between the producers and creators? See if they could get something like this green-lit? Because that type of boldness deserves some form of respect, surely.\n(Nevertheless, Netflix would have happily payed for it anyway if Sony had said no. But Netflix is hardly a challenge in getting something through, so they wouldn't count).",

Miller's Gene towards the start of The Emoji Movie is just one of the messages that can be found throughout Sony Pictures' cash cow scheme to bring in more money from a bad movie, which of course with the title Emoji Movie what's more to expect? Yes, this is the worst animated feature of the year for mainly one reason is that animations can be seen as the most creative form of film, however the idea to have multiple facial expression as the protagonists is possibly the laziest from of creativity. The Emoji Movie opens with Gene a multi-expressional Emoji who can change his expression by the flick of his face; his quest is to be placed on the screen for his user. He lives with other Emojis in Textville a world filled with different faces and emotions. The plot is essentially that Gene is fired from Textville's message board called The Cube, so he sets out on a quest to become a normal Emoji. That's pretty much it. Is there more to having a multi-expressional Emoji who tries to become normal? Of course, because for that it would have to follow logic and, from the off there is no logic here. There are many references to other, better forms of communication which of course our characters travel through in order to get to Cloud through Dropbox it's a continuous spiral of references and piling bad puns which can be seen from a mile away and will have you shacking your head. At its best the animation colourful (though mostly yellow) and brings all these emojis to full colour \u2013 even this deviates between cheap rubbery animation techniques to knock-off Pixar. There is even a short before the film based on Sony's own Hotel Transylvania in a vague attempt to follow Pixar success. In terms of cast, choosing T.J. Miller as Gene isn't a bad choice as he delivers some perhaps extended charm to the feature. With him there is a wide variety of different voices to hear firstly there's, Smiler (Maya Rudolph), Jailbreak (Anna Faris) a hacker, Hi-5 (James Corden), Mel Meh (Steven Wright),and finally there's Poop (Patrick Stewart) \u2013 though these are clever casting choices they are given nothing funny to say, in fact most of the things they do say is piled on by bad puns \u2013 \"I'm always smiling\" Smiler says at one point which makes this become lazy and incoherent to follow (in case you tried). In short, The Emoji Movie is a faithless; a zestless boilerplate animation which fails in many accesses of its audience and deserves a huge thumb down. VERDICT: An annoying, zestless, tasteless and boring animation which comes with lazy themes and tropes, abandon all hope ye who enter here.",

That movie isn't even on par with the awful disgrace to humanity that is the Emoji movie. This is not even close to being a good movie. If you can even call it a movie, it's the worst movie ever made! And there have been lots of bad animated films, hell lots of films in general, what is this the year 2017. But I think this one takes the awful cake made out of rotten eggs made out of smartphone emoji's. It's a rip off of The Lego Movie, Inside Out, and Wreck it Ralph all at once, and it is beyond any doubt the worst thing that Sony ever created. Worse than Hotel Transylvania, worse than Open Season, worse than the Smurfs reboot, worse than the Annie remake, worse than Battlefield Los Angeles, worse than After Earth, worse than Pixels, worse than Ghostbusters 2016. There may be films that are worse in plot like Home on the Range, worse aesthetically like Shark Tale, or worse character wise like Norm of the North.

The emojis ended up improving his social life somehow, which doesn't make sense (Alex's crush takes a liking to him because he sent her an emoji, her reasoning being that he's more expressive with his emotions than other guys. Through emojis.) and contradicts what emojis were made out to be by the film itself: nuisances to actual social lives.I found no redeeming qualities. The fact it relies on product placement to progress the story. The terribly unoriginal and lazily minimalistic character designs. To add insult to injury, the cheap animation and bare minimum of a story pair well with the unfunny performances the film provided, especially the character of Hi-5, who was one of the worst comic relief characters I've ever seen or heard in a film, ever.In addition, the Jailbreak emoji did almost nothing to aid multi-expression emoji Gene on his journey, only acting as his unnecessary love interest. The reveal that she's actually a princess emoji is not in the least surprising, as she implies it multiple times prior to the reveal, unsubtly.Also, hearing T. J.

It's terrible and I'm not just saying that or agreeing It's true, where do I begin?, oh let's start with the concept which as expected copies Disney's Wreck-It Ralph, Pixar's Inside Out and a bit of LEGO Movie In there, three really great films that are WAY better then this... this! GARBAGE!.Another Issue Is the plot, characters and humour, why all In one?, because they are all same like In most kids movies, bland and very mean-spirited characters, generic plot and hit or miss humour and this movie does exactly that, I'll admit I did get a couple of chuckles out of this movie, coming from HI-5 and that's about It, that's properly the closest to be funny, everything else Is just cringey, unfunny and insulting, even the moral of being yourself really makes It more obviously cringey that It completely ripoff Inside Out!.The only plots that there Is are Gene's parents going out of Textroplis to look for him and main villain Smiler going on about deleting Gene and they are really pointless and predicable that they might as well remove It entirely, the characters also got through a lot of apps like YouTube, Facebook even the Twitter bird Is a character, they even show ApplePen on YouTube... and Gene says hashtag.. I'm not kidding, these people must be so obsessed with putting lots of advertising In their own movie about Emojis!... good grief..I guess the only tolerable that I like Is the animation, It's colorful, looks nice and well designed, well on the humans, the Emojis just look basic and dull, maybe If all of the problems I mentioned were fixed In a YouTube series about Emojis, I would of been fine with that, but to be released AS A MOVIE?! IN CINEMAS?! THIS IS LITTERLY CANCER!.So yeah the Emoji Movie SUCKS!, It's dull, unfunny, clich\u00e9d, characters are a-holes, the idea and moral rips off other successful movies and the concept makes no sense, the animation Is okay and Hi-5 did me chuckle a couple of times, even the voice acting from talented people like TJ Miller, James Corden, Anna Farris and even Patrick Stewart feel wasted on this... piece of s**t!, jus... just don't see guys, they are better kids films out there to watch like Cars 3, Despicble Me 3 and Captain Underpants which I think are stilling In cinemas at this point.I wish to forget this movie entirely, It's worse then Norm of the North! and Ice Age: Collision Course!, yes I just said that Norm of the North was averagely bad and Ice Age 5'has some good things In It.As expected I'm giving this cancerous movie 0/10, do I need to explain why?",

            "content": "It's no surprise to me that, in today's world, The Emoji Movie is a film that actually exists. Emojis are everywhere thanks to the dependence of smartphones to communicate and it won't be long until it overtakes Chinese, Spanish and English as the most common spoken language in the world. That's not even possible by the way but they'll find a way.Gene (T. J. Miller), a multi-expressional emoji, sets out on a journey to become a normal emoji. There's a little bit more to the plot however, it's not even worth delving further into what this is actually about.Anyone who's ever used a smartphone will be able to tell you that there can be some fun had in using emojis to express yourself, whether it be in an innocent or rude manner. Is it fun to sit through a ninety-minute film about emojis though? The answer is a resounding no.The Emoji Movie is just an excuse for blatant product placement and a chance to make incredibly irrelevant references to popular culture, the Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen song playing as they enter the YouTube app making me want to scream in anger. It's full of insanely annoying characters too, James Corden's Hi-5 being like a turd that just won't flush. You think he's gone but then he makes a very unwanted return.The product as a whole, whether it be the unimaginative animation or the uninspired vocal performances, is void of any likability factor and the fact that I didn't hear one child laugh throughout speaks volumes. Animated films have come on leaps and bounds when it comes to conveying a message to the audience, but not The Emoji Movie. One of the only messages I took from this film was that boys should talk to girls via emojis prior to any form of human interaction. F**k my life.The Emoji Movie is as bad as I thought it'd be and then some. Avoid at all costs.",

Who is pushing sexism on young children? Why is it always one sided sexism? The Ninjago movie lacked heart. The Emoji movie has heart (especially due to T. J. Miller's performance). You end up liking most of the characters. However, the story is very predictable and leaves little to the imagination. This is what separates this movie from a Pixar movie. Pixar movies have heart and brains.If you really have to pick a movie for the holiday season for your children, get out an old movie so you don't have to deal with the gender politics (\"why are men always taking credit for what women do\" type of garbage). If you're desperate for a cinema experience, pick the Emoji movie.",

She watches some dumb shows/movies on Netflix or Disney Jr. channel. I thought I've seen enough of those things to prepare myself for anything this Emoji movie can throw at me. Oh sh!t I was naive! This is the first movie I can bet $10000 on how it would end just after 5 minutes into the plot. And there is ABSOLUTELY no highlight point throughout the 80 minutes of bore. I would have completely fallen asleep within 20 minutes if I was not the only adult accompanying my girl.It is absolutely fitting that the main character is called Meh. All conversations are Meh. Jokes are meh. Story lines are meh. I understand our reliance on, or addiction to, digital gadgets is somewhat inevitable in our lives, but PLEASE!

            "content": "Since \"Toy Story\" became an enormous box- office hit and a beloved modern masterpiece by giving audiences an inspired look at what ordinary toys do when their owners aren't around, Hollywood has been striving to repeat that seemingly simple formula with a number of animated films that have offered viewers a privileged glimpse at the heretofore unseen existence of everything from the shelves of a grocery store (the execrable \"Foodfight!\") to the psyche of a young girl (the stunning \"Inside Out\"). Now comes \"The Emoji Movie,\" a film that dares to ask \"What goes on in the magical worlds contained within our cell phones?,\" a notion that I do not think that anyone has ever pondered for any amount of time outside of those stuck in a focus group at Sony Animation. That is only the first of many problems with this film, a work so completely devoid of wit, style, intelligence or basic entertainment value that it makes that movie based on the Angry Birds app seem like a pure artistic statement by comparison.The extremely dubious conceit of \"The Emoji Movie\" is that hidden within the messaging app in our phones is a teeming metropolis known as Textopolis, where all of the emojis live and wait to be called upon by their owners to say what mere words cannot. All emojis are supposed to have only one facial expression but Gene (T.J. Miller), who is supposed to be a \"meh\" like his parents (Steven Wright\u00a0and\u00a0Jennifer Coolidge), is just so darn exuberant that he is unable to stick with just one expression. This becomes a problem when his phone's owner, a 14-year-old boy named Alex struggling to reach out to the girl that he likes, selects Gene for a text he is sending to her\u2014Gene chokes at the last second and coughs up so many expressions that it is impossible to understand what he is supposed to represent. Discovering his secret and fearing what it could mean for everyone if one emoji seems to be malfunctioning, Smiler (Maya Rudolph), the always-grinning leader of Textopolis, decides to have Gene wiped out for good.\u00a0Gene manages to escape Smiler's clutches and with the help of another outcast emoji, the once-popular Hi-5 (James Corden), he hits upon a plan to have himself reprogrammed to show only one expression so that he can finally fit in. The only emoji who can do this for him is master hacker Jailbreak (Anna Faris), who agrees to help him if he will come with her on a journey to the fabled Cloud, where his ability to change expressions could help her get past the impenetrable firewall protecting it. Their journey across the phone takes the three to a number of different apps and along the way, they learn valuable lessons about Being Yourself and Friendship and the like while being pursued by Smiler's troops, who have all been outfitted with illegal upgrades to make them extra-powerful. To make matters worse, Alex, having grown increasingly annoyed by the glitches inadvertently caused by Gene's journey, has made an appointment to have his phone and everything contained within completely erased.So what wonders lie just beneath our touch screens, anyway? Based on the evidence put forth by \"The Emoji Movie,\" it is a combination of product placement and corporate synergy. Textopolis itself is an indifferently conceived and executed cityscape populated by any number of familiar emojis, the most famous of which is presumably Poop, who is voiced by none other than Sir\u00a0Patrick Stewart\u00a0in one of his less dignified gigs. Once we get outside the walls of Textopolis, we are essentially placed into a series of mini-ads for well- known apps that range from brief detours to the lands of Facebook and YouTube to extended commercials for the Candy Crush and Just Dance games. Since nothing of import goes on during these scenes (or any others, for that matter), I found myself speculating on which ones spent the most money to appear in the film based on the length of their exposure and the praise that they receive from the characters. Based on the available evidence, Dropbox must have been the big spender here\u2014not only is it the all-important gateway to the Cloud but the characters manage to safely hide out from the bad guys there because, and I quote, \"they are illegal malware and this app is secure.\" Then again, my guess is that the film could have gone into profit solely from taking money from companies eager to keep their apps as far away from this as possible.",

I reviewed Supergirl before, might wanna check out that review to know what to expect in this movie as well.This movie is awful. Ugly looking Emoji characters (and yes, they are ugly looking in apps too) bought to life with barren, featureless personality. In-fact, the only slightly funny character is the \"High Five\", a side-kick for the generic Hollywood protagonist and the generic \"SUPER TOUGH KICKS ASS\" female character.Ignoring the ugly CGI characters, if you just focus on the characters, they are just.. bland. I don't even know how to describe the damn thing because it's just so boring and stupid that there is so much to criticize and I can't be arsed with doing it again.Let's just finish the review with a list of feminist/liberal/leftists propaganda included in the movie, shall we? 1.) Hero is a metro sexual male who wants to express his feelings.2.) Female is a tough as nails chick who only likes cool things. Oh and she is a supercool hacker fighting the patriarchy.3.) Both male characters (Hero and side-kick, High Five) scream and yell like little girls when the female character does things like water slide or fall. Female character is always laughing and brave in these scenes of course.4.) Female character likes the male for being so expressive, unlike the \"other\" guys.5.) Female character thinks women are portrayed as only princesses and wants to be more. Wants to be someone else. Meanwhile, hero wants the same but she tells him to \"be who he is\" and not change a thing.6.) Sh*t dance sequence when the movie ends.This is like they took advice from whoever directs Supergirl on how to make the most \"liberal\" piece of garbage they could. And again, like Supergirl, I would've ignored their propaganda if rest of the content was actually good. And why the hell is there Patrick Stewart in this movie?",

Though the Human Designs are good, and especially Alex's, he doesn't look like he's pandering to the Mexican or Musically community, I'm also gay for him, but that's just embarrassing. I mean, the story could've been about Alex being disrespectful due to him in is Phone world while after he makes a big mistake, the Emoji's try to tell him to talk it out instead of zone out on your phone, that way It can tell people to get off their phones and talk situations out. As it's own thing, it only Encourages people to zone out on their technology, in spite of Alex's design and voice, this movie only gave me limited amount of emotions.

We've seen it all from various obscure choices in the video game archives; to Barbie to 'Thomas the Tank Engine' to board games and to Lego. They will make a movie out of bloody anything given half a chance. I'm half expecting an animated movie about the world of marbles to roll along anytime soon (yes I'm proud of that pun).I think its fair to say I wasn't expecting anything much from this movie, if anything I only saw it out of pure morbid curiosity. I was simply intrigued at how they could construct a narrative around some mobile phone app icons. And my God do they try their best here! They really stretch and reach and twist that thin ass plot as best they can. Does it work? Not really no, but kudos for trying.I mean I can't deny there are some nice little touches here, its not all terrible. The emoji's live inside a phone (duh) which is owned by a young boy named Alex. Said boy is going through the usual pre- pubescent angst with girls and whatnot and of course being young he uses his phone a lot. Within the phone the emoji's dwell in the city of Textopolis (I like it), their daily job is to produce their emoticon or expression on demand (when Alex uses it). Gene is a 'meh' emoji but he can also make other expressions which is looked upon as freakish, or like having a rare disease. When Gene gets his chance to be used by Alex he has a nervous breakdown and fudges it up. He then finds himself listed for deletion because he is now deemed a malfunction. Gene must now flee the city with another has- been emoji to help him find a hacker to hopefully get himself fixed.So the plot is pretty much the same old sh*t we've many times before. The protagonist must go on the run to evade the antagonist and her henchmen (henchemoji's). Along the way the protagonist meets new friends that are considered losers basically; and in the end after numerous scrapes they all discover themselves and make friends (whilst saving the day). Its a standard plot mapped on top of this emoji concept. Despite that its still flippin' convoluted though, the nonsense they set up to explain how emoji's are used on a phone. Its kinda treated like a gameshow scenario where talented, experienced and obviously popular emoji's are used regularly (almost like a sports team). But if an emoji shows good promise or whatever then they get the chance to be 'promoted' onto the phones main app screen. It sounds ridiculous because it basically is. Then all the emoji's that aren't used anymore get lumped into a loser lounge type scenario. Very predictable but also somewhat daft as I'm sure most emoji's actually get used a fair bit the world over.Call me stupid but one of the main fun things about this movie was spotting all the different emoji's (sad I know). And sure enough they're all here, right down to the national flags. I quite like how the old emoticons are presented as old age pensioners, umm...that's about as clever as it gets really. Aside from that the entire movie plays out like a long TV advert for various smart phone apps like 'Twitter', 'Candy Crush', 'Just Dance' etc...The movie also uses every flippin' bit of computer jargon it can muster, in a very predictable and cringeworthy fashion. For instance, pirating is represented by...yep...pirates. A Trojan horse is...umm...a big horse. A firewall is a big fiery wall (ugh!!!), and a virus is a sick looking electronic bacteria (flip me!). Add to that a whole bunch of nauseating pop songs, modern trendy teen lingo, various brands and voil\u00e0! The sidekick characters bland and unfunny (hi-five and a princess), again totally predictable. Alex decides to completely wipe his phone when a few apps play up, why not just uninstall them? When the phone is almost wiped Alex stops because of an unusual emoji?? (Gene pulling a stupid face). This emoji is then sent to the girl he has a crush on and she instantly likes him because of that?? Most of the emoji's in Textopolis are erased during this process, but they all come back perfectly OK when the phone is rebooted? No side affects from that?Overall the movie certainly isn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be (but its still quite bad). There are some kernels of a good idea hidden away within, the odd sparse highlight. But again overall its still very very basic, bland, uninspiring, unfunny, and it doesn't even look that great really. This was always gonna be an uphill battle simply because what the hell can you do with emoji's?? I stand by my kudos to all involved for actually managing to produce something that isn't a complete train wreck, but at the end of the day I think we can all agree with was a complete waste of time and money. Heck the aim seems to be to push young kids towards their phones more than ever. As if youngsters need that kind of encouragement these days.3.5/10",

My 7 y.o. daughter, however, had other ideas. Following Gene (T.J. Miller), a malfunctioning 'meh' emoji who can't control his vast range of emotions, we enter the working world of a smartphone whereby every tap of the screen requires a functioning digital population to make it happen. In a universe where everyone (everything?) has its place, Gene is ridiculed for his expressiveness and, after sending out the wrong emoji for his user (Alex, a teenage boy in the midst of his first romance), must go on the run from the delete-happy Smiler (Maya Rudolph). Ostensibly an adventure comedy, there is neither enough thrills to make it exciting or enough laughs to make it amusing; ironically falling into a zone of complete meh-ness. The jokes about twitter, internet trolls and the controlling nature of smartphones in modern society would have been astute a few years ago, in 2017 they're already out-dated and tired. And the target audience for this film wont understand them anyway. Thankfully there are some hilarious visual gags like the poop emoji exiting the toilet\u0085 oh wait, nope, even that is old and boring, barely getting a titter from the packed cinema of kids (and parents regretting their choice) ready to laugh at just about anything. The animation is unsurprisingly bright and James Corden's sidekick Hi-5 adds a smidge of delight, however The Emoji Movie ultimately has less flavour and value-for-money than the watered-down soft drink and over-priced popcorn from the cinema's candy bar.",

Umm.... 1. The actual animation was good. Some of the imagery was well crafted...2. The \"plot\" was very unclear. Mixed messages...at first it sounds anti-tech, even sort of shaming society for being so addicted to their phones, but the whole movie is pretty much just one big product placement.It never explained how or why **SPOILER!** going to \"the cloud\" would restore High 5's popularity3. The extremely glazed over blink-and-you'll-miss-it scenes of the \"real world\" high school...why even bother to include it? Seemed like an after thought. Very VERY badly handled. And why have a dramatic 4 hour count down clock when it isn't mentioned again, and the tech appointment is changed in the end anyway?4. The other emojis made fun of Gene (names weren't memorable) because he has other emotions. Why? This was never clearly established, just vaguely referenced.5. There is something really wrong and inconsistent about the timing and pacing, and distances in the movie...can't quite put my finger on it. Relationships are formed too quickly between strangers. Gene and I-didn't't-bother-to-learn-her-name character have to travel all the way across the phone to rescue High-5 but when the villainous drone chases them around, the distance seems off. Am I wrong? 6. I got a few random chuckles here and there, but several hours later, I can't seem to recall any actual jokes...I think this movie tried to shoe-horn in a really corny introspective look at the inner working of...phones? Not having an \"every man for himself\" attitude? I'm starting to ramble and get angry now; my cue to stop typing.

Every awful clich\u00e9 from almost any other animated movie is present here, even clich\u00e9s that could be considered the weakest parts of good animated films, at least those movies had other redeeming qualities, this one lacks any kind of positive aspect.I do believe that this is the worst of Hollywood, the cynical product placement (The whole movie is one), the awful politics it tries to shove down people's throats, the predictable story, the usual character archetypes we see every time and the evident disconnect it has from its target audience.

But, I just can not decide who this movie is aimed at. It's animated, so that usually means small kids. The subject matter is about emojis in smartphones, so you would think maybe older teens and adults. There are a lot of poopy jokes, usually with or about the poop emoji, so that goes back to the younger audience. I don't know, maybe they were just trying to cover all their bases and try to have something for everybody. Whatever the case, it didn't work for me. The emoji world inside your smartphones is explored and you get to see how it works, at least according to this movie. T.J./Meh plays an emoji that has more than one emotion-all the other emojis have only one-so he goes on a quest to get himself straightened out. James/Hi-5 and Anna/Jailbreak come along to assist him. Maya/Smiler disapproves and tries to put a damper on their trip. There is a short film called 'The Puppy' that is shown before the movie-it has characters from the 'Hotel Transylvania' movies. There is also a scene right after the end credits start, but nothing at the very end. It's rated \"PG\" for some rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 26 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't think I would rent it either.

            "content": "This movie got one thing right with it's marketing, and that's that it's \"not easy being meh.\" For that to happen, you need a few things: some effort, equal parts creative, and some semblance of a soul. Even if it's not enough, you at least tried, and the problem with this movie is that it doesn't give a care in the world.While the animation and voice acting is good enough, the rest of the movie doesn't just go downhill, it jumps of a twenty foot cliff into a gorge of spikes, rattle snakes, and lava, and the worst part is it could've been another Lego Movie, Wreck-It Ralph, and Inside Out but decides to prove everybody right instead. First of all, the story makes no sense. The story follows Gene, a \"meh\" emoji, as he, Hi-5, and Jailbreak, the \"hacker emoji how happens to be a princess who can call the Twitter bird despite being mad at Gene and Hi-5 for asking, journey to the cloud where Gene will be able to be \"meh.\" Get ready for some plot holes, folks, because you'll getting them. As you can already guess, Gene's parents are also \"meh\" emojis, however, Gene has a case of not sticking to one emotion, because he can feel them all, baby, and as you progress through the movie, you learn that his father, Mel, also had the same issue, yet he was able to control the emotions. So why didn't he help Gene during the years he was a father? Seriously, this \"disorder\" didn't crop up overnight, did it? And why was Gene allowed to work with people knowing he has this \"disorder?\" No one snitched? Anyway, as you can expect, Gene messes up on his first day, when he made the wrong face, causing Alex the Human to send the wrong emoji to his crush, Ms. InsertRandomNameHereBecauseICan'tRememberIfSheWasInTheMovieOrNot (it's actually Addie, but as interesting she is, that might as well be her name). Let's look at how the movies it tried to rip off handle humans. In the Lego Movie, we learn that the movie took place within a child's imagination, thus leading up to a heartwarming end when the father appears, Inside Out was about emotions within the human mind, which does affect the human in some ways, and Wreck-It Ralph at least had the decency to have the humans take a back seat when Fix-It Felix Jr. didn't properly due to Ralph's absence. Yes, they made the danger of being trashed, but you didn't see the human every few minutes, because to the humans, the video game cabinet was just getting old and was likely glitching out for that reason. Here though, we cut back and forth between Phone World and the Human World. I don't like these punk kids. They're so obsessed with their phones that they can't communicate without it, and it feels like I'm a political cartoon about phones. They also have no personality other than being cutouts, and whenever the emojis journey into an app, they mess with the phone itself, such as turning on Spotify, Candy Crush, and Just Dance, embarrassing Alex, and that's it. Speaking of those things, the product placement! Seriously, they are terrible. Not only do they say the name of the apps, but they also demonstrate how to play Just Dance and Candy Crush. You have better fun playing a tutorial level in a video game than what's basically the equivalent of YouTuber reminding you every five minutes that video is sponsored by Dollar Shave Club. It makes the movie so...soulless. Back to the story though, there are more things that don't make sense. For example, the trash can scene! Okay, if an app gets deleted, wouldn't the people inhabiting the app essentially be dead and not alive in the Memory Dump from Inside Out? Also, why are trolls and spam there? While they were in the piracy app Alex had, these two things are not baked into phones or the apps themselves. Trolls are people who rile others up by saying \"mean\" things for their own enjoyment, and spam is stored on a server. So, again, why are they here? Also, Alex decides to erase his phone, in what's really the longest end-of-the-world segment I've seen, and because Gene used his multiple personalities to save his world, Alex unplugs the phone while it's wiping and sends the emoji to Ms. WhoAreYouAgain. First of all, I'm sure that will corrupt data on the phone, and what makes Alex believe it wasn't a virus causing that? Again, he has a piracy app installed, disguised as the Dictionary app, so he would've right to assume such thing. They didn't even try to write a cohesive story, I think the out-of-touch big-wigs at Sony just wanted the forced product placement in it.Lastly, the characters are either vanilla or horrible. Examples are Hi-5 being a useless comic relief character until convenient, Hacker was a princess emoji that gets mad at Gene and Hi-5 for asking about whistling for birds, but she calls the Twitter bird anyway, and then there's Poop. This character is the reason Xavier went crazy in Logan, because he knew his actor took the easy job of just spouting a bunch of cringy poop jokes. Let's not forget Gene's dad, who , if you remember early in the review, is definitely parent of the year. The humans are also so boring with one-not personalities that they are really token characters, which is ironic since T.J. Miller, the voice of Jean, said that the movie had a \"non-preachy feminist agenda.\" Please, do yourself a favor, and don't buy this movie. Don't even rent it. It's pretty much as bad as critics say it is. Only great thing about it was the Puppy short showed before it, and even that's on YouTube. Terrible movie!",

            "content": "The Emoji Movie 3 out of 10.\nOn all levels, it is a derivative of Wreck it Ralph and similar movies, replicating its premise, characters and themes, but executed without any nuance, design, substance or purpose. Where Wreck it Ralph is built on easy nostalgia-bait, the Emoji Movie seems to be a series of advertisements and product placements for Just Dance, Candy Crush and other apps. The Emoji Movie goes so far as to copy the twist regarding the female lead.The viewing experience is tiring as the comedy the movie strings its plot points together with is either knowingly lazy, or arrogantly naive. Humour in this movie is supposedly evident when high five throws up candy, monkeys say they are off to do \"monkey business\", or when Sir Patrick Stewart, the poop emoji says the words \"stink\", \"duty\", and -\nEmoji 1: \"Poop, youre so soft\"\nSir Patrick Stewart as the poop emoji: \"Not too soft I hope\"The animation was basic, but not poor and distracting, so I guess that makes it boring. The world of 'Textopolis' and the phone was very basic and bare, even with all the bright colours on the screen. The music in this movie is played very obnoxiously, with half relevant dance songs such as, wake me up before you go-go, feel this moment and cheerleader to name a few. The icing on the cake to this movie is when it ends on an impromptu dance party, where everyone comes to accept the main character instantly, kinda like, but worse than, Despicable Me, Megamind and The LEGO Movie.\nThe relationships between the main three characters, the high five, the meh and jailbreak was more like 3 people hanging around each other, going to the same place, than high five and meh being friends and jailbreak any sort of love interest.\nThe slang made to relate to kids was also outdated by the time this movie came out. Having James Corden say shade, #blessed, lit and slay was really forced and unnecessary. I would also rather leave out the references in this movie that do not appeal to kids and are not enough to appeal to adults. The poop emoji pretending to be in star trek, the culture of internet trolls and the Trojan horse virus.\nKids deserve better than a cheap 86 minute distraction - see The Lego Movie or Wreck it Ralph instead, which both executed an 'it's okay to be yourself/different' story on a far greater level.",

            "review_title": "The Emoji Movie",
            "content": "In the modern world, using emojis in text, from facial expressions to common objects, symbols, places and types of weather, and animals, has become the norm, and someone had the bright (stupid) idea to make a movie set in a world full of them! Basically, in a digital city called Textopolis, inside the mobile phone of a user, school teenager Alex (Jake T. Austin), lives thousands of emojis. Gene (Office Christmas Party's T. J. Miller) is the \"meh\" emoji, son of meh emojis Mel (Steven Wright) and Mary (Jennifer Coolidge), who can make multiple expressions despite his parents' upbringing. His parents are hesitant about him going to work, but Gene insists as he wants to feel useful. Alex receives a text from his love interest Addie McCallister (Tati Gabrielle), and he decides to send her an emoji. When Gene is selected, he panics, sending out a panicked expression, and causes the wreckage of text centre. Gene is called in by Smiler (Maya Rudolph), a smiley emoji and leader of the text centre, who concludes that Gene is a \"malfunction\" and therefore must be deleted. Gene is chased by bots but is rescued by Hi-5 (James Corden), a once-popular emoji who has since lost his fame due to lack of use. Hi-5 tells Gene that he can be fixed if they find a hacker, and he hopes to reclaim his fame while helping him. Smiler sends more bots to search for Gene when she finds out that he has left Textopolis, and his actions have made Alex think his phone is starting to go wrong and needs fixing. Gene and Hi-5 come to a piracy app where they meet a hacker emoji named Jailbreak (Anna Faris), who wants to reach Dropbox so that she can live in the cloud. Smiler's bots find the trio and attack them, but they escape into the game Candy Crush. Jailbreak reveals that Gene can be fixed in the cloud, and the group travel through the Just Dance app. While there, Jailbreak is revealed to be a princess emoji who fled home after tiring of being stereotyped. They are again attacked by bots, and their actions cause Alex to delete the Just Dance app. Gene and Jailbreak escape, but Hi-5 is taken with the app into trash. Mel and Mary go searching for Gene, arguing on the way, but making up in the Instagram app, where Mel reveals is a malfunction, explaining Gene's behaviour. While travelling through Spotify, Jailbreak admits that she likes Gene just the way he is and that he should not be ashamed of his malfunction. Gene and Jailbreak start to fall in love, and he quietly debates his choice to change himself. They reach the trash and rescue Hi-5 but are soon attacked by a bot upgraded with illegal malware. They evade it after entering Dropbox, where they encounter a firewall. After many tries, the group enter a password, which is Addie's name, to enter the cloud, where Jailbreak prepares to reprogram Gene. Gene admits his feelings for Jailbreak, but she turns him down, breaking Gene's heart and unintentionally causing him to revert to his apathetic programming. Suddenly, the upgraded bot sneaks into the cloud and captures Gene, prompting Hi-5 and Jailbreak to go after him, using a Twitter bird which Jailbreaks summons in her princess form. As Smiler prepares to delete Gene, Mel and Mary arrive. Mel reveals to everyone that he is also a malfunction, prompting Smiler to threaten to delete him as well. Jailbreak and Hi-5 arrive and disable the bot, which falls on top of Smiler. Alex takes his phone to a technical support store intending to return it to a factory reset and restore his phone's functionality, which will cause the destruction of Textopolis. In desperation, Gene prepares to have himself texted to Addie, making numerous faces to express himself. Addie receives this text message, whilst the phone is being reset, and Alex realises this. Alex cancels the factory reset just before everything is wiped, saving the emoji world, and Alex is confident to speak to Addie, who likes the emoji she was sent. Gene accepts himself for the emoji he is and is celebrated by all other emojis, while Smiler has joined the \"loser lounge\", full of many other unused and forgotten emojis. Also starring Sir Patrick Stewart as Poop, Christina Aguilera as Akiko Glitter, America's Got Talent's Sof\u00eda Vergara as Flamenca, Rachael Ray as Spam, and Will & Grace's Sean Hayes as 'Devil' Steven, with additional voices by Elizabeth Daily, Phil LaMarr, and Tara Strong. The cast of well-known stars voicing the familiar emojis are okay, the animation is colourful, I personally didn't mind the commercialism and blatant company plugs (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Candy Crush, Twitter, Spotify and many more), but I agree the plot is thin, it often gets annoying, it is not very funny, and I doubt even kids will be entertained, no wonder it was swamped by negativity, it is pretty \ud83d\udca9, a silly animated science-fiction comedy. It won the Razzies for Worst Director for Tony Leondis, Worst Screen Combo for Any Two Obnoxious Emojis, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Picture. Adequate!",

            "review_title": "I'm so f*cking p*ssed",
            "content": "Okay, where do I begin with this film. Well it is a movie. One that was masterfully animated might I add. So let us dive into the film itself as a whole and the amount of plot points it has and doesn't need. For 1, it is first and foremost a movie about love an acceptance. Good for kids, until you have one of the villains straight up murder some guy. Yeah, there's a lot of murder in this movie, 16 deaths in total, all murder. This may have been the first time I yelled \"Oh sh*t\" in a kids movie, that's how out of place the murder was. Let's not forget that this movie isn't just about emoji love but human love too. Love between two freshmen high school who's entire life is their phone, as masterfully narrated by T.J. miller. In comes gene, the son of the emoji's whose only job is to do the \"meh\" face. They live in \"Textopolis\" a city just made out of emoji's. Don't fret about this place, it doesn't matter after about 30 minutes in. Gene messes up and puts the entire phone in danger for being deleted (Which in this case means death. The inhabitants of this phone would be murdered and understand this so they're pretty terrified) forcing gene to run away from angry murder bots out to ki- I mean delete him. So he goes to find a hacker (Hackers live in phones somehow) in the piracy app (I wanna apologize but there are so many issues I just have to mention in parenthesis like what is a piracy app?) where everyone who lives in that app is, you guessed it, f*cking pirates. Here they meet a hacker whose name is jailbreak cause \"ha ha ha, I'm sure kids will get that reference,\" but hey at least they're treating their audience like adults even though it's directed at 1 to 10 year olds, I digress. Jail break says they can upload them to the cloud where they can be free, reprogram gene to not be expressive, and turn the high five emoji (his name is just high five) into a popular emoji again so he can end back up in the popular lounge where only the most used emojis go (this is his entire character arch). So they leave the piracy app and go to some other app, I don't remember although I do know they passed through the Facebook app which is why I have to write this stupid review. The movie is pretty much a giant ad for other apps. Like Facebook, twitter, Instagram, spottily, just dance app, etc. So here is where it gets contrived, there are way too many plot points. Let me run down a quick list before we get back to our snarky summary cause f*ck this movie1. Being an outcast 2. Love 3. Emoji love 4. Not knowing how to talk to girls 5. The murder (deletion) of everyone and thing on this kids phone 6. Emoji marriage issues 7. Being a mess up (I'm looking at you gene) 8. Accepting yourself 9. feminism (this ones an issue cause there is one line about it before it's just never mentioned again, ever) 10. Asking a girl to a dance 11. AddictionAnd not to mention any of the other throw away plots just doused in the film. Honestly this film is all over the place and has no real direction cause for every created plot point one is thrown away. Let's get back to the movie, one of the apps they visit is \"Candy Crush\" cause that's a popular app that paid for time here. So gene almost gets murdered during a giant game of candy crush and you find out that high five emoji is a caffeine addict. Next app they go too is the just dance app where they're told they want to be very quiet cause murder bots are after them (Anti Virus bots) so of course they accidentally get caught in a really loud game of just dance where if you don't dance good you get killed. So jailbreak sucks at dancing and just when you thought the movie couldn't get worse there is a horrible dance number. Murder bots find them and download a dance mode so they can dance and catch up to our three hero's but the phone is playing just dance in real life too and so the kid deletes the app in a frenzy cause the entire world of that app to fall apart. High Five dies along with all the murder bots. Everyone is heartbroken for a few minutes and then onward on our quest to Dropbox. So we go through one last app, \"Spotify\" where all music is streamed. Because every movie needs horrible puns all the music is a stream that you can boat down. They boat down some song made in 2014 or something and then end up in a nice slow stream where gene and jailbreak are doing some major crushing. Then out of f*cking nowhere and I mean nowhere this kids downloaded whale song (which wouldn't even be on spotify cause it was a download) defies the rule this movie has where all music is a stream and becomes a go*damn whale. So they leave, go to the trash bin where they find out high five emoji is alive save him (but not the just dance girl who is obviously traumatized and was crying) leaving the rest of the trashed apps to die. Now I'm almost at my limit, there is a lot wrong with this movie but if your drunk or with a few buddies I'm sure you could have fun with it. There's too many extra plots to finish this review in under 1000's words so I'll leave with this. the movie sucks.",

            "content": "Review:\nMy expectations for this movie really wasn't that high, especially after reading all of the bad reviews but after watching it, I was surprised to see that it actually had a back story. Although it's made for kids, we all can relate to the various apps which are mentioned throughout the film, and the different emoji's which help us to make texting easier but from an entertainment point of view, it really didn't do it for me. The jokes are pretty weak, for kids and adults, along with the storyline which become tedious after a while. Anyway, the movie is based within a phone, were the Emojis live in the city of Textopolis, hoping to be used by the user. Like every phone, each emoji has there own face expression, except for Gene (T.J. Miller) who can change his expressions, which is against there policy. When Gene is finally up to become an emoji on the users phone, he's unable to stick to one expression, which crashes the emoji database. The leader of the emojis, Smiler (Maya Rudolph) is forced to punish Gene for crashing the database, by deleting him all together, so he escapes from Textopolis, with the help of Hi-5 (James Corden) and Jailbreak (Anna Faris), and they try to break back into the phone with Smilers soldiers close behind them. Jailbreak uses her skills to get Gene back into the phone but they have to go through various apps to get through the backdoor in the users phone. While they are doing this, the users phone isn't working properly, so he goes to the App Store to delete all the apps, which will destroy Textopolis. With there life's in danger, and time against them, Gene and his pals have to convince the user that they should stay on the phone, even though Gene caused all of the problems in the first place. It's quite a sweet story, and the relationship between Gene and Jailbreak was quite emotional but it was all a bit childish for me. The animation was half decent but nothing amazing, and the various characters wasn't too bad, especially Hi-5 but there wasn't memorable moments. Personally I think that the director made a bad movie out of a good idea, which is why it didn't go down to well with audiences, even though it made a hefty profit. Disappointing!Round-Up:\nThis movie was directed and written by Tony Leondis, 50, who also brought you Lilo & Stitch 2 and Igor. With all of the different emojis, the director could have gone in many directions with this film but he chose to stick to one character, which was a bad choice in my eyes. His previous projects also wasn't that great, so I think that Sony made a big mistake picking him for the project. As I wasn't expecting much from this film, I wasn't that surprised with the outcome so it just has to go down as a bad attempt at a good concept.Budget: $50million\nWorldwide Gross: $217millionGenre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy\nCast: T.J.

The characters are so one dimensional that I only needed to see the extended movie trailer to know the motivations and personalities of each character. There is the main character, going about his life until one day, he messes up his job and needs to climb back up to his position where he could save the day. On the way, he has a love interest with a troubled past, the idiotic sidekick that means well and tries to help the main character but just gets in the way. There is the Den of Deplorables where the scum and the forgotten reside. Then, there is the constant \"threat\" overhanging the world that has the possibility of destroying their community if the character does not hurry up. Then there is an impenetrable obstacle in the way that blocks the character's path of least resistance. Finally, there is the scene where the love interest and main character go through a beautiful scene where they both learn that there is a meaning to life (for example, look at Wall-e.)

I have seen some movies that are worth rating a 1 before, but The Emoji Movie isn't quite that bad. This was the perfect movie for my 11 year old son, as he LOVED It! I was mildly amused. The movie wasn't awful, and it wasn't great.The movie is about a \"meh\" emoticon that gets sent (by the user) while making a different face. Apparently, it is unheard of to make the wrong face, so that gets him into a lot of trouble. He befriends an emoticon that used to be popular, but is hardly ever used now, and they seek out a emoticon defector/hacker to help Gene (Meh), become the meh he thinks he is supposed to be. I felt the movie had a good message about being yourself, although the character's aren't given much depth in the film.If you are considering taking your kids to this because you want something to do, but are unsure because of your reviews, you could take a chance on it. If you are broke and don't go to the movies very often, however, wait for video or streaming. Overall, it is a light, cheesy watch if there isn't anything else to see with the kids.",

It's such a lazy attempt, there is absolutely no creativity and there doesn't seem to have been that much care put into this. How about that product placement, also?!I will say I do like the idea, you could probably create a fine film with it. However, man did they get the execution incredibly wrong. That's also not good given the cast performances, all of which are quite pathetic. In fairness, they don't exactly get much to work with.I'm someone who likes James Corden, but he is terrible here. As is T.J. Miller, while Anna Faris and Maya Rudolph are forgettable. I was disappointed (sorta) not to see more of Patrick Stewart's character, given how much I've heard in recent years; he's barely in it.It's a painful watch, even with a run time of just 86 minutes.",

I actually borrowed the film from a friend of mine and a few weeks later they played it on Netflix...go figure. I really only watched it because I wanted to see if it really is the worst film of the year and honestly it's not. Like I said it's not a great film, it has it's cute moment but I wouldn't declare it the worst film of 2017 that goes to Mother! which you can read my review of that but let's not open that can of worms please. \n The film is about this emoji who is a Meh who only job is to go meh when someone hits his emoji but he has all these other emojis that he can't keep straight so it effect his job and his boss wants to terminate him before he corrupt the entire work force. Basically the Meh emoji enlist his friends to help him from being deleted. Okay now that we have our pilot of the film let me tell you what I thought of the film a bit more. It was cute. I will admit I did like the message of the film to be yourself and not just stick to what you normally do. Branch out and be you. The Candy Crush part was pretty cute because I play that game so I enjoyed that scene but the dancing game to get to the next stage was a bit too predictable for my taste. \n Should you watch this film? Well I guess if you have small kids they'll find it enjoyable and with today teenagers they'll understand the emojis because they have these smartphones with all the emojis from the film. I think they should pass a law that no kid under the age of 10 should own a cellphone! Kids are too wrapped up into their phones these days. My niece is 9 and she has a cellphone why? These kids ain't got nobody to call at that age except maybe their parents. It's silly if you ask me. So I suppose if you want to view it and see for yourself if you think it's the so called worst film of 2017 but I personality wouldn't view it again unless I have to. If I am forced to watch it again I'll remember to bring my book so at least I'll get some reading done.",

It was funny - I laughed, satirical, and not too rough on the edges. It was never going to logically make sense in a million years, but that wasn't the point and that's not what got anyone in the studio.Instead the real criticism perhaps can be it's similarity to other animation pieces, however it's best to note where conceptually the assimilations could be placed before saying it's a cop-out. With the ratings alone I never thought I was going to watch it, but it's definitely not a 3/10, it's about a 5/10 and one extra for even pulling it off at all so a 6.If there was ever going to be world where this is a 7 or 8, the age rating would likely have to have been upscaled, and also the originality of this movie undoubted.",

We are a family of all ages from 6 to 50 and did not watch this movie for quite a while BECAUSE of its bad ratings (3.0). (so it should be one of the worst movies of all times).\nAfter watching it, all of us completely disagree. It quite is funny, has some nice twists and an ok story. It one of the many 5.5 to 6.0 animations that are entertaining and easy to watch. \nI cannot understand either the rating nor some of the bad critics here.\nWhy is it a problem to have some similarities to other stories? (and hey yess Inside out has a trash dump too, and in Wreck it Ralph they also changing between apps)The book of life plays partially in the \"world of the remembered\" and Coco does too, that does not mean Coco is any less of a great movie.Don\u00b4t get me wrong! Of course the Emoji Movie is NOT Coco. But to my opinion its a solid 5 or even a weak 6. ...and to all those who said \"we\u00b4ve seen it all before\" here some IMDB ratings with no further comments ... Justice League 6.9\nAvengers 8.1\nThe Flash 8.0\nSpider-Man 7.3\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 7.0\nSpider-Man Homecoming 7.5..and yes rotten tomatoes also slaughtered the movie, but we found more and more to not look at their critics because what we consider to be good movies seems to be quite different to their judgement.

This may just be the worst animated family comedy of all time.The worst thing about The Emoji Movie is just how insanely boring it is and how weak the entire concept is. The film focuses on an emoji who can portray multiple expressions, so he goes on the run with two other misfits and it's just a borefest of an adventure inside the smartphone. Whoever decided to do an animated family adventure-comedy about emojis actually had a good idea, but it needs to match with a good story.And it's not just one of those slapstick films that kids will love and adults will hate, it's exceptionally boring for all audiences. The characters are horribly-designed and fail to be engaging. The writing in every other area of the film is terrible and there's very few jokes that are even acceptable for children's humour. James Corden's voice performance is super-annoying and for goodness sake! It's such a boring film!

            "content": "The Emoji Movie (2017) is arguably the worst movie of 2017. It tries to be comedic and funny, while also having emotional depth. The final product has neither. What it does have is a poor script and cheap animation. The characters have little to no depth, and the scenes are not well placed. In the very beginning, there is an emotional scene between Gene (T.J. Miller) and his parents (Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge), before we know anything about the characters or what is happening. Most of the jokes fall flat. Also, this movie is basically a giant ad. Scenes include Candy Crush, Just Dance, and even Dropbox. Even the emojis themselves could be considered creative product placement.First, there are so many plot holes that the movie does not even remotely make sense. The emojis have to be scanned every time Alex (Jake T. Austin), the boy who owns their phone, wants to send one. Wouldn't it be easier for them just to have a picture taken and used every time? Alex can already see their pictures on the keyboard, so clearly they have them. Also, Gene and his friends are afraid of being \"wiped\" from the phone. Emoji come preprogrammed on every phone, so this would not even affect them. It also brings up many unanswered questions, such as: Why doesn't Alex just wipe the phone himself? What happens if he wants to use Jailbreak's princess emoji? Does the same world exist on everyone else's phones? And, shouldn't all phones with this software be having the same problems? In the beginning, when Gene panics and makes multiple faces while being scanned, it makes a strange-looking combination emoji. Then at the end, doing the exact same thing makes a cool-looking, animated emoji. There are too many flaws in the logic of this movie.Although other animated movies, such as Wreck-it Ralph, Trolls, Toy Story, and The Lego Movie, have successfully made a movie out of a product, those movies at least had depth and a good storyline. The Emoji Movie, on the other hand, simply states \"This character is happy, that one is sad, and this one doesn't like the other two.\" Instead of gradually revealing the character's traits, this movie explicitly states them. One of its major flaws is that none of the characters change or learn anything except for Gene. The movie tries to have a theme of self-acceptance, but comes across as having no moral whatsoever.Overall, The Emoji Movie is an uncreative approach at making a movie out of something we see nearly every day, emoji. Possibly the only good thing about it is that it is available on Netflix. I don't recommend watching it, unless you have absolutely nothing else. Actually, even if you have nothing else, you might not want to watch it. This cheaply made Sony Animation movie is not worth wasting your time on.",

I despised the Novel by Charles Dickens as I was a retarded child but now I am a man and am able to look beneath the surface of this total masterpiece and will share my interpretation of it with you. Gene is a very relatable hero played by funny man, T.J Miller. His struggle is both believable and emotional and you really feel for his pain. His conflict with the villainous Smiler represents racism and class struggle in the United States of America under Trump's reign of terror. Hi-5 is Gene's unexpected friend for life throughout the movie played by funny man, James Corden known for his work on Carpool Karaoke. The show that won't get out of YouTube trending. He acts as the catalyst for many knee-slapping jokes. He was once Alex's favourite emoji but as time progressed he is but a useless emoji who spends all his time in the \"loser lounge\". This is symbolism for Lucifer's fall from heaven as he is cast down by his god to the deepest, darkest depths of hell. This is seen again when Hi-5 is left in the trash after the destruction of Just Dance. Jailbreak is a strong independent female who don't need no man. I totally ship GeneBrake. However I was disappointed they do not smash. Not even once! But this just a nitpick and I'm sure we will see this if the geniuses behind this masterpiece (Sony pictures animation) decide to create a sequel to this work of perfection. Poop is played by Sir Patrick Stuart and the joke here is that Poop is played by Sir Patrick Stuart. It gets me every time. Alex, the phone user, acts as God. He is and omnipotent being who hears and sees all. He owns the phone and is worshipped by all emojis who inhabits it. However he is displeased by the emojis and seeks to destroy them. This is symbolism for when God sent the great flood to cleanse the world by destroying its inhabitants. The here is that Alex changes his decision whereas God wipes the entirety of the humans aside from an old man and his family who built a boat. In conclusion The Emoji Movie is a flawless work of art which cannot be criticised and if you do you worship Satan and practice the works of the devil.Thank you for listening to my TED talk.

You should see the Nostaglia Critic review on this and The Emoji Movie because The Garbage Pail Kids just absolutely broke Doug Walker (the host).Onto The Emoji Movie. First off, who came up with this? It's cringy and full of stupidity. Second, the charecters are all brats. Jailbreak is always acting so bossy even when she's not the one in trouble. High-5 was the worst one of all...He has a very annoying voice, terrible humor, and just useless in the journey except for just causing more chaos. Gene was boring, hardly did anything. However, I must give some credit to the animatio in this movie, it's amazing! But still save your time and money.Score: 1.5/10",

The animation was terrible (seriously it looks like something from 2004 not 2017), the story line um....there really isn't one except \"Three unlikely friends have to save the world, but really don't do much to reach the goal until the final Macguffin. For an all star cast, it sounded like the actors all had guns to their head. Stale deliveries abound like the 800 product placements that litter this movie. In other words, I can almost always find something good in a movie. I never give out 1's. I VERY Rarely give a 10. To me, an 8 means it's a great movie. A 10 means it's just a work of art and transcends being just a movie. I think the worst score I've ever given before was a 3 because even in bad movies, there are redeeming qualities such as maybe great cinematography or a particular scene or actor that stuck out, or even just good editing.This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I took my niece and nephew to it (7 and 9 years old) and even they were asking \"Can we just leave and go watch a different movie?\" about 20 minutes in. And that's exactly what we did.Seriously, I hate that most people vote either 1 or 10 most of the time because why have a scale at all if you are one of those people. In this case, this movie deserves all of the 1's it gets.The only reason it is even rated 1.6 is because of the blatantly obvious corporate review shrills. So after being on IMDb for like 13 years now, I finally found a movie that was so bad that it earned my first 1 star rating. I'd give it a 0 if I could.",

With the help from some good writers and a talented director, they can bring a product we wouldn't dream of being in a movie to life and leave an influence on future movies. Where a\u00a0movie like \"The Lego Movie\" does it right, a movie like \"The Emoji Movie\"\u00a0does not. In fact, the latter doesn't do it right at all. It fails on every single level imaginable resulting in one of the worst animated movies I've ever seen in my entire life with a clich\u00e9d story, uncreative animation, and characters so annoying and unlikeable that at times you might actually get drawn to your own smartphone. If you want further proof\u00a0that this movie is awful, here's the clich\u00e9d premise I was talking about.On the smartphone of a high school student named Alex (Jake T. Austin), an entire urban city filled with \"the most important form of communication ever invented\" (that is exactly what the film said, I am not kidding), emojis. Each one has a specific personality and has to act the certain way. However, a\u00a0meh emoji named Gene (T.J. Miller) exhibits multiple personalities and is considered an outcast by the other emojis. Gee, where have I seen that before? After causing chaos, he is hunted down by evil bots headed by Smiler (Maya Rudolph in yet another awful animated movie) and runs into a hand emoji named Hi-5 who along with a hacker emoji named Jailbreak\u00a0(Anna Faris) attempt to leave the phone and try to get to the Cloud. Along the way, they go through multiple apps just there to get some product placement in while trying to avoid the evil Smiler. There's also some subplots involving Gene's parents (Steven Wright and\u00a0Jennifer Coolidge) getting separated along with Alex having trouble expressing his feelings to a girl he likes, but considering that I already lost some sanity watching this awful movie, I'd rather movie on.After I saw the abomination that was last years \"Norm of the North\", I thought that there would be no animated movie that could possibly be worse, that is until I saw this. It's not only really bad, it's unbearable.\u00a0The thing I hate most about this awful movie is how much money the film wasted. It apparently cost fifty million dollars to make this movie and just thinking about it makes me enraged. Imagine what you could have done with that money rather than make this garbage. You could have built a homeless shelter in every single state in America or\u00a0you could have given it to the poor so they won't go to bed hungry. But no, Sony Pictures Animation just had to waste it on a movie so awful that it might have given me brain damage. The story is nothing but clich\u00e9s. Every single plot point had already been done and the film decided to steal the creativity from great animated movies like \"Wreck-It Ralph\", \"The Lego Movie\" and \"Inside Out\". Not only that, but most of the film is just devoted to product placement which I'll just say is some of the worst in film history. I'm not joking when I say that it plays apps like Instagram, Candy Crush Saga, Twitter, Facebook,\u00a0Just Dance, YouTube, Spotify and especially Dropbox\u00a0 have integral plot points to this film. Even the ending to this movie, which I won't spoil, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.\u00a0The animation is also highly uncreative. While it's not bad, it looks absolutely unimaginative and has no\u00a0creativity put into it. Every single world in this movie has been shown better in other films. I honestly can't blame the animators for this as these poor people are being treated like paper by their terrible and stupid managers as was revealed in a leaked letter from 2014. As for the characters, well, what do you think? There's bland, clich\u00e9d, extremely unfunny and have phoned in voice performances from its actors. I honestly have no idea why any of these actors accepted this movie. My only guess is that they were blackmailed in to doing it by Sony. Then again, I don't blame them for not putting any effort into this.\"The Emoji Movie\" is one of, if not the worst animated movie released so far this decade. I hated every single thing about this movie. It's an absolute insult to the animation genre as a whole and has no reason to exist on this planet at all.\u00a0I really\u00a0hope the Razzies consider this movie for Worst Picture because if there's anything this film will be remembered for, is as the movie that was made just to cash in on a fad. Let's hope that Hollywood will learn it's lesson with this film, \u00a0just because\u00a0you can\u00a0make a movie based on anything, doesn't mean you should.",

            "content": "Well, the one film critics were anticipating is finally here. I went to see it myself and found that nobody was kidding about how bad this movie was!The story is Gene a meh emoji can't keep a straight face for some poorly explained reason and is outcast for that, along with High 5 and Jailbreak, the love interest. On the other side of the phone, Alex (the human) tries asking a girl out on a date, but his phone keeps humiliating him before he can pop the question.Nobody was kidding about how much this movie shamelessly rips off Wreck-it Ralph, Inside Out, and Lego Movie. The only difference between Inside Out and this movie is that Inside Out had plausible situations: if Sadness affected Riley, she would display it as a reaction to change happening around her. In this movie, if an emoji messes up, the phone literally jumps around and opens up unwanted apps. If it explained butt dialing, that would be one thing. Also, Wreck it Ralph had mostly familiar characters with an already attached story within the games they belonged to. Emojis have no story. It's the same as making a story for the Garbage Pail Kids cards. It also manages to rip off Chicken Little (unlikable characters), Through the Looking Glass (cop out ending), Bee Movie (hero searching for more in life through adventure), Foodfight (horrible puns and rips off Wreck it Ralph), and Toy Story. Even the director admits that he loved Toy Story so much that he wanted to make a toy movie that hadn't been touched yet.Another major problem is on Alex's side of the story, he tries to use an emoji to ask a girl out to the dance. First of all, nobody would be able to guess by an emoji that you want to go out on a dance. Second, she's literally two desks away from him that he could whisper to her or text her the words: \"U wanna go out with me?\" This makes the emojis unnecessarily important.All of the emoji characters are irritating in a unique way: Gene is the generic bland hero, Jailbreak is a \"cool\" love interest who turns out to be a princess (just like Wreck it Ralph!), High 5 is the useless \"comic relief\", Mel Meh is the unsupportive father that has a 180 character arc in the last twenty minutes, Smiler is the Joker wannabe, and everyone else is a bland jerk to Gene for no reason other than \"he's different, shun him\". Good storytelling doesn't depend on two dimensional characters to make the hero likable.I tried finding good things about the movie and found only two:1) The background and human animation: Sony is capable of doing some really good animation and it really shows with the phone world. Each app location does have a unique feel to it; not as impressive as Wreck it Ralph, but still really good. Also the human characters are a better improvement than Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.2) The background jokes: The jokes that the movie loves to market are shockingly unfunny, but the barely noticed jokes are surprisingly funny. For instance Spam was funny and another joke involves an emoji Christmas tree who keeps shouting \"Merry Christmas\" and another emoji replies, \"It's still September, Tim.\" That actually made me laugh! Why couldn't we have more of those jokes and less of \"We're Number 2\" jokes?I may have been merciful on those two elements, but the rest of the movie is awful with shameful rip offs, unfunny jokes, irritating clich\u00e9s, wasted talent, and aggravating cash grab idea of exploiting emojis. If this movie came out before Wreck it Ralph and Inside out, I think it could have had a better chance of being less hated. I always thought that emoji toys were overrated and this movie nails why I think so. I'm tempted to not give Sony's Peter Rabbit and Star a chance, but I'm not that cruel. However, this movie is awful and I highly don't recommend it. I don't care if it's just for kids; they deserve better than this.",

            "content": "It has become a meme of how bad this movie is. After watching it I feel that it was not so bad.\nThe movie is basically Wreck-it Ralph meets Inside-Out. Those movies are hardly masterpieces to begin with, and to me their biggest quality was their high-concept premise. Wreck-it Ralph is already an adaptation of Toy Story but with video games and Inside Out is too transparent with its emotional arcs.\nAnyway, that leaves us with a movie that does not have an original premise, does not have a visually unique aesthetic and has a very linear story. Yet, I did not hate this film. Is it boring? Yes definitely, but mostly because a lot of what it does I have already seen before. However, for younger audiences that have not seen a lot of movie this might not be an issue.Other than that, the movie suffers from flaws that are independent from the movie itself. These are problems that affect larger movies, and that have nothing to do with the story or the way it is told. For instance, the fact that every character is voiced by a celebrity. The omnipresent use of product placement or references to real life brands. It distracted me constantly. These things are not necessarily bad, and if you don't know what Dropbox or Spotify is, then you're fine. But for me, it made it harder to invest myself in the movie's universe. You cannot get lost if everything you see is recognisable.A positive thing that I will give the movie credit for, is that it makes good use of the emojis themselves. There is enough variety to make it interesting, even if it is not particularly inspired. (in other words it is rather \"meh\" (I'm so sorry))\nVisually, the animations are well done. Technically the film holds up. That is why I do not understand the sheer hate this movie gets. It might be lazy sure, but it is not necessarily incompetent.That being said there was one sequence that irked me a little, when James Corden declares \"you don't need real friends but you only need fans that give you unrelenting support as long as you are on top\". This sequence, which revolves around being an ad for Facebook, goes totally unchallenged by the characters or the narrative, and it is rather strange message for a movie aimed at kids that might not grasp all the nuances and caveats of social media.Overall, the movie is heavily flawed and uninspired. Yet, I don't feel that it is dramatically different from any other modern children oriented animated movies. When compared to Wreck-it Ralph or Inside-Out, the former is saved by its love for video games and the latter works on the human story level, not so much on the heavy-handed metaphor. The emojis are not an old tradition with a passionate subculture and the over-arching story of the teen getting his phone wiped is not especially riveting. But there is fancy colours.",

I personally enjoyed watching it, it was a simple, clean ish other than the emoji, lol humoured movie. I also think a lot of people can relate to how the main character felt and the simple message of embracing who you truly are is something people need to hear.I don't know what the true intentions were of all the 'product placement' but it makes sense to the movie, it would actually be kinda strange if it wasn't there. The animation wasn't bad either, purity good for the style they went with.All in all it was a good movie I think, and don't be ashamed of being apart of something others hate even if it's good.

At school everyone was talking about how trash it is and stuff. Well, that is what 2 of my friends say anyways. And for the whole school days we sometimes talk about why the movie is garbage and how the characters too atrocious (referring to the 3rd Dimensional smileys with arms and legs.) I said that I was gonna watch it after it's launch. and never did. For 3 years. Till in 2020, I thought that I was going to watch said movie title on Netflix. My sister has her subscription of Netflix for the both of us so it would be very easy to get ahold with the movie. So I actually watched it.

None.\n-It is a rip off of a lot of animated miracles of the decade. Like Inside Out or The Lego Movie. Or Wreck it Ralph. It explores characters trying to express themselves (Inside Out), Crazy haired feminists (The Lego Movie's Wildstyle, except the \"feminist\" in The Emoji Movie was kind of a vehicle to propel what is right nowadays), and going to different apps (Wreck it Ralph, apps instead of video games).\n-The \"jokes\" were so unoriginal and predictable and unfunny I had to have a cold water bottle next to me so I could douse myself to stop my brain from overheating.\n-The ending of this abomination should have made me happy. You know, the movie is over, I can go back to living a regular life, but it didn't. It was so infuriatingly out of touch about how kids act nowadays that I was considering tearing out my brain and selling it for export so I wouldn't have to remember it.

In reality, both films are scrounging at the bottom of the barrel as far as kids flicks go. I can't totally pan either one because they, unfortunately, both kept my daughter's attention to varying degrees. The bar is low. Sorry, sweatpants princesses. Ideally, one would stay away from both of these on the general principle that they--apart from trying to ruin your brain with their maddeningly fast-paced content--they fall prey to being straight-up, pro-consumerist garbage. The Emoji Movie is honestly probably more annoying than Wreck-It Ralph 2 but because it's premise is, by default, more original, I would give it the slight nod as far as my recommendations go.",

One of the sub plots is about a teen who is trying to send the right emoji to his crush which is cringy just thinking about it. And while meh is gone, his boring parents talk about separating. Im not joking those are the actual plot points in this movie.Know before i get into the abominations of this movie, let me just say that if you want to get some friends together and you want to make fun of a movie that is so terrible, then go see this (BUT NOT IN THEATERS NO NO NO NO GOD NO) i saw this movie online for free and that is the only reason i am not giving this movie a 1 star rating because me and my drunk friends at least had fun ripping on it. Anyway there is a lot of things i hated but i don't want you to read 8 paragraphs so ill make it short. The plots are messy and stupid, the characters are terrible and some actors are wasted in this film like Patrick Stewart, the jokes are cringy and flat out laughable but not in a good way, the film tries to teach meaningless themes like feminism and it serves no purpose in the film, the movie is boring, the editing feels like it was done by an 11 year old, And worst of all the movie is one big advertisement. In the end The Emoji Movie is a terrible movie for all ages and it will probably please those who are morbidly obsessed with emojis, but i mean come on who thought this movie was actually gonna be good. And to think that Sony canceled Popeye for this idiotic trash makes me sick to my stomach. 2/10 or F Easily the worst movie i have seen in the last 5 years.",

This is, at best, 90 minutes of advertising I paid to watch. The product placements are so blatant and insulting that I almost gave up halfway through the film. Also, keep in mind these advertisements were targeted at young children who can't see them for the slap in the face that they are.

The entire movie (excluding the short at the beginning and the credits) is only about 78 minutes long. It's not even feature length. The Hotel Transylvania short at the beginning was funnier than this whole movie. Gene is an emoji which has many emotions, he is a glitch basically, and the smiley emoji isn't happy that he made the wrong face when Alex (the phone's user) selected him. Alex is sad because he doesn't know how to talk to the girl he likes. Even though he has her phone number. So Gene (why he is given a name yet 90% of the other emojis don't have a name I have no idea) decides to see Jailbreak, a hacker which can make him just feel \"meh\". She will help him get to the cloud where she can be free and she can turn him into meh. Hi Five tags along for some reason. To get to The Cloud they have to get to DropBox\u0099. Not kidding. But before that they look at Facebook\u0099, Instagram\u0099, YouTube\u0099 and Candycrush\u0099. They spend 7 minutes playing Cnadycrush. And another 5 minutes playing Just Dance\u0099. I wish I was making this up but I'm not. Hi 5 gets deleted with the Just Dance\u0099\u0099\u0099\u0099 App and ends up in the trash. Gene wants to save him. Spoiler alert, Jailbreak is the princess emoji. She and Gene carry on and go to Spotify\u0099\u0099\u0099\u0099 and ride the music waves. Then they get to Dropbox after being chased by malware the smiley emoji sent out. But don't worry, Jailbreak told us that Dropbox\u0099\u0099\u0099\u0099 is secure!!! They upload to the cloud and fly on the twitter\u0099\u0099\u0099\u0099\u0099 bird to save High 5 and then they all dance at the end and everyone in the audience loses their will to live.",

The jokes are awesome and subtle, and if you really pay attention, this movie will make you laugh out loud.The plot is awesome and really refreshing. The movie setting (the Wallpaper, how the apps works for the characters, etc) is very unpredictable and cool. The characters themselves are very funny (especially Hi-5). The only flaw this movie have for me is that the flow is a little rushed. It's just been, what, 20 mins into the movie and the conflict is already unfolding. But that's okay, since the little details are worth it.I highly recommend this movie despite the low ratings of other people. \u270b",

I guess this movie targets only children who are 6 years old haha. Well that was a boring calculation but not as boring as the film itself. Way too oversimplified and unattractive.

Its about the same kind of level as any of a dozen direct to DVD 'specials' I've seen this year.Its basically a budget retread of the lego movie. Emojis try to escape from a smartphone by crossing through apps on the homescreen to get to 'the cloud' which they will access via dropbox. Some of the product placement is fairly crass but no worse than the lego movie and not as bad as many reviews I've read have implied. The characters get trapped in versions of candy crush and lets dance. Quite a lot of it is negative to the apps themselves (ie facebook) and i was surprised a key feature of the story was a 'pirate' app called 'jailbreak'.Its a kids movie, my kids (4 and 7) enjoyed it though one jump scare did get to my 4 year old (a robot unexpectedly grabs a character and snatches them off screen). They enjoyed it, as did the majority of the audience. Only one family left early and thats not unusual in a family screening. I've only ever fallen asleep during one movie in my life (wesley snipes the art of war). This is infinitely better than that movie and that movie gets 5.7? Go figure.",

            "content": "While I didn't like the movie, I can't call The Emoji Movie disappointing. Not because it was good, but because I didn't have very high expectations for it anyway. I didn't think it was going to be very good, and it wasn't. This movie follows Gene, a meh emoji with multiple facial expressions and emotions, and his two friends High Five (the pointless comic relief) and Jailbreak. Obviously, the cast isn't very good, with a completely pointless characters and two rather flat ones. What bothers me is that the writers didn't take the time to even develop or come up with interesting characters. Gene is the stereotypical outcast because he's different than everyone else, and Jailbreak is the rebel princess (who didn't see THAT twist coming?). The rest of the emojis contributed nothing to the plot and were only there to make a few corny emoji puns. The only character I can say was decent was Smiler. I liked how the movie portrayed her as unstable and a bit unnerving.It's pretty obvious this movie was made solely to advertise random phone apps such as Candy Crush, Spotify, Just Dance (which, as far as I know, isn't even an app), YouTube, Dropbox, Instagram, and so many more. 90% of the movie was just one giant advertisement seeing as half the story follows the main characters hopping from one app to another.However, as bad as characters and product placement are, the overall plot of the movie is possibly the worst part. There's just not much originality to it, with most of the plot taking ideas from more successful movies such as Wreck-it-Ralph, Inside Out, and The Lego Movie to name a few. And their message (to express yourself as a unique individual), while important, has been done many times before and was poorly executed in The Emoji Movie. The human lead, Alex, a teenager in his first year of high school, has trouble expressing himself. But at the end of the movie, how does Alex accomplish self expression? With the use of a multi-facial emoji! It's like the point of the movie is to show that self-expression can only be achieved through the use of your phone.Overall, The Emoji Movie's only redeeming qualities are the antagonist and the animation (especially the scenery). Otherwise, it's just another clich\u00e9 kid's movie and will soon be forgotten among some other forgettable animated movies.",

It was a pandering, clich\u00e9 mess of a movie that makes \"The Room\" look like a masterpiece. To be frank, I only watched the emoji movie because I was expecting it to be so bad that it was actually comical. Unfortunately, this movie's horrific nature is due to the immense blandness of the plot, the characters, the visuals. The plot is full of clich\u00e9s, as are the characters. Each character is one dimensional and lacks nuance. Even the main character, Gene, is made to be a nuanced character who breaks the mold. However, he ends up being a one dimensional rest like everyone else. The visuals are uninspired. Every frame is full of colors, but frankly, the vibrancy just makes everything look like a can of children's medicines. Now would be an appropriate time to to make an analogy: Assume the Emoji Movie is a blank canvas, it is basic, pandering and clich\u00e9. Assume the Room is a child's drawing. A child's drawing, although inherently bad, is still more valuable than a blank canvas. The former is personal and is something that the child worked hard to make. The latter can be bought at a store and was built by a machine. In essence, the Emoji movie was made by a machine, made in a formulaic way. It lacks emotion, subtlety, or nuance. If you have a few hours on your hands, don't watch this film, watch something that was made by an artist, or even a generic human. Or even something made by yourself.",

            "content": "Have you ever met someone and knew right away that they were the best thing that's ever happened to you? It feels strange because you've lived your entire life without even knowing they existed, but you wonder how you survived for this long without them in your life. I can honestly say that I've just felt true love for the first, and probably last, time in my life. For the longest time, you've listened to songs singing about love and romance, but you were never able to relate to them. All of the sudden, you are able to connect with nearly every single word you hear on an emotional level. You think about them literally all the time and can't imagine a future without them. It's funny how the tiniest chance encounter can have such profound effects. I feel really terrible and heartbroken now because I have to come to terms with the fact that my one true love may soon be gone for some time. The worst thing in the world is finding out that they don't share your feelings back. I know that this may seem like a lot of work just to express my feelings, but trust me, I would do so much more to show my love if I could. I am, of course, referring to The Emoji Movie!That is why it's about time I give my one true love, The Emoji Movie, the affection it deserves. Ever since I was introduced to The Emoji Movie on July 28, 2017, I became an entirely new person. I was just a kid hopelessly in love with something I knew would never return my feelings.I feel confident in saying that The Emoji Movie truly is the greatest film of all time. I don't think anything will ever make me believe otherwise (except for The Emoji Movie 2, of course). Not only is Gene, the multi-expressional Emoji, the greatest character ever put to film, he is also the most emotionally (dare I say, \"emojinally?\") complex and three-dimensional character I have ever seen. I praise Tony Leondis for effectively being able to make me care so much about a character that I would not normally give the time of day. The Emoji Movie has made me a better person because it taught me that there are always more layers to people. The Emoji Movie has the amazing message that it is OK to be yourself in an oppressive world that arbitrarily forces you to be one thing for your entire life. I have so much newfound respect for all Emojis now, especially the \"Meh\" (\ud83d\ude12) Emoji. The plot of The Emoji Movie is too precious, unpredictable, creative, intelligent, entertaining, and enthralling to spoil for you here, but I will say it will have you on the edge of your seat for the entire 86 minutes no matter how many times you've already watched it. Every time I see it in theaters I buy a popcorn, but never even touch it because I am too focused on The Emoji Movie to notice anything going on outside of that screen. Films like The Emoji Movie are so special, they offer great educational value to children of all ages AND they offer a great, engaging, intense theater experience; something that sad excuse of a film, Dunkirk, couldn't offer. When I first walked out of my first Emoji Movie screening, I was shaking because I had just been on the greatest emotional roller coaster of my life. People may try and use Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, or IMDb as a credible source to justify why they think this masterpiece is bad. I am more than happy that The Emoji Movie is receiving rocky reviews from the start. Obviously it deserves 100% everywhere and from everyone, but some of the greatest films of the past were all miserably misunderstood at the time of their initial release. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, many people who lack the brain capacity necessary to comprehend such important, life-changing messages presented in The Emoji Movie walked out of the theater. Citizen Kane, which is no longer considered the greatest film of all time since the release of The Emoji Movie July 28, 2017, was widely panned by audiences for being too progressive for its time. I will be waiting for the day when film schools all around the world show their students The Emoji Movie as an example of how to thematically, technically, and cinematically make a perfect film. Don't even get me started on the comedy aspect of it! The Emoji Movie is also the funniest movie ever! It has non-stop humor that makes me laugh every time I see it. Sometimes, I laugh so hard that I almost choke or pass out. Somehow, I was laughing for 106 minutes straight even though The Emoji Movie is only 86 minutes! Some of the jokes just stick with you long after the movie ends and you burst out laughing whenever you think of them. If you didn't notice, I tried to keep my Emoji usage here to a minimum. You may be wondering why I am doing this if I am such a big fan of The Emoji Movie. Well, that is because I learned from The Emoji Movie that not all Emojis were made to fit into only one emotion. I prefer to understand the Emoji's deeper feelings and emotions that may be contrary to the assumed emotion they are stereotyped to represent. I seriously pity anyone who uses Emojis when they haven't seen The Emoji Movie because they can't understand the deeper emotions the Emojis experience like us Emoji Movie fans can. Those people can only take the Emojis at face value.",

The main example of this is the High Five character (perfectly voiced by James Corden, and this is not a compliment BTW). His arc is to be adored and popular again, but there is no conflict at all. TJ Miller's \"Meh\" follows a similar flat-line progression of \"characted not happy, expresses what they want, gets it\" The hacker character also has little to no driving action either.And the simultaneous real-world plot involving a boy and girl? Forget about it. I think the filmmakers did and then remembered and hastily crow-barred a useless race-against-time final act that (SPOILER ALERT) in itself, makes no sense whatsoever (i.e. a kid that can't wipe their own phone?

Being a failure & outcast, he manages to befriend a person who accepts him and helps him find a possible solution. Eventually he meets a girl who's also not a social norm and helps him embrace who he is.This movie is not hard to understand, not repulsive or atrocious, and not an abomination; on top of that it has somewhat imaginative visual aspects. There are many worse movies out there (Woody Woodpecker being the most recent one I watched), which may have ACTUAL nonsensical story, worse dialog, really REALLY bad acting, or poke-my-eyes-out special effects.

Bright, crisp fluid animation meets the modern-day version of Shakespeare (though nowhere nears as boring). The characters almost leap off the screen as they are so believable. Then, with such an all-star cast (including Stiffler's mom. STIFFLER'S MOM)The DVD and Blu-Ray sales are going to be OFF THE CHARTS! I would suggest pre-ordering whatever deluxe steelbook 4k edition now as to not disappointment little Bobby or Suzie on Christmas morning. In the meantime, I would suggest multiple rewatches. Heck, find a homeless person and take them with you to see this film. It is so awesome and life-changing that when they are through witnessing this triumph of entertainment, the will no longer be a hobo.I really wish I had more stars to give.",

This is evident in the trailer so this is not a spoiler.I thought it was OK. The animation was quite good and there was some relatable and creative moments which I think was the only thing this movie had going for it. There was also some cheeky product placement which was very obvious however there were some funny relatable smart phone moments (not going into too much detail) that did make me chuckle... NOT laugh. (big difference).This movie is basically your clich\u00e9 animated kids movie.. it has some humor that is slightly funny, a villain, and an end goal. I predicted the ending within the first 10 minutes of watching the film. I was right. There were so many opportunites missed with this film but I am surprised at the 1.5 average rating. I would have given it a bit more then that. Overall I do not recommend this movie and rather suggest you spend your money on one of the better movies out right now. cough cough (Dunkirk)",

But anyway getting back to this the animation is atrocious.Characters: This all I will say the characters in this movie are unlikable characters they are people you just hate because of the personality of the characters as well as them being nothing but brain dead idiots and this is as bad of if not worse than Home On the Range with its characters being annoying unlikable characters.

An 88-minute evil, stupid, manipulative and offensive commercial. Yes, it's a commercial, not a movie. Because the film is so focused to promote apps and emojis instead of thinking how to make this movie work.People might be overrating the Lego movies, but it's justified. As much as it's an excuse to sell Legos, it had an actual creative team that thought a good script first, and then how to sell it. Same case with Toy Story, they had a creative and inspired team that loved animation and cared about this concept as silly it sounds, and it worked.The emoji movie doesn't want to be creative, funny or at least unique in any aspect. It's your typical \"be yourself\" movie but with characters that are mean spirited with no personality, with a story that makes no sense and with really bad morals about treating the rest of people. This is a \"movie\" that embraces the smartphones and apps and tells you that you should depend on your phone instead of talk with real people and live the real life.This is a \"movie\" that manipulates you with pop songs, random and stupid jokes, bad animation and awful dialogue to buy everything they offer in this commercial and to make you think that the things they say in this movie is \"profund\".This is a \"movie\" that says that it's OK to be yourself, but you need to break rules and do nothing to fix your problem unless it's buying a smartphone.This is a \"movie\" that it's already dated by the time to review is posted, that shows no compassion to the kids, that treats the audience like stupid people who went to see this and insults every piece of minimum of cleverness just to the sake to sell toys about emojis.Sony Pictures Animation failed so bad to make this movie a franchise and it shows they don't know how to make a good animated movie, because they are more focused on how to market this towards children.It's a waste of time and no other kid should see this by its own merits ever again. It needs to be banished from the history of film making and from the art of animation.You want to show something for your kids? Let them watch anything else instead of Emoji movie. Because it doesn't teach anything good, it's mean spirited, it's too stupid to be taken seriously and it's too annoying and uninspired to be a comedy.Don't watch it ironically, don't watch it for the memes, don't watch it as a family film, just avoid everything that it's related with this horrible product.

I try to dig deep into that character, but I can't because there was no character development. Smiler who has a creepy smile who was the main villain of this movie. But, I don't find that she was that evil. she try to make sure that all emoji are perfect. Gene is the one who mess up the text cause Smiler to send the robot to delete him because of malfunction. Gene the meh face who has multiple expressions that no emojis has expect his father meh later throughout the movie. Hi-five Gene's friend who was annoying, unlikable, unfunny, and love to tell jokes throughout the movie. Jailbreak who has the ability to hack the phone in order to get Drop box and bring Gene back to just meh. and then later, she was revealed that she was a princess emoji. However, her character design was a ripoff of Wyldstyle from the Lego Movie. The character development was terrible. The character was bland, tasteless, mindless, mean-spirited, and unlikable. Story: The writing was terrible. The joke was too simple and it's not funny.

There's one where poop and his son said \"We're number 2\" Story was Mindless, Boring, and predictable. Also the story was a Rip-off from Inside out and Wreck it Ralph like Ralph jump from game to game while emoji jump from app to app. Inside out like send the wrong feelings while emoji send the wrong face. The plot twist was very weak because There was no backstories. It did not explain How Gene and his father has more than one facial expression. Plot: After Gene send the wrong face to Alex's Crush, he went to the meeting room with Smiler. She sense that Gene was malfunction. She send the robot to delete Gene so the phone can return to normal. Gene and Hi-five escape the world with no explanation. and jump into the app to avoid the robot as they try to delete Gene. They Jump into app to app (troll, YouTube, candy crush, just dance, and Music wave.) until they get to the Dropbox (that was the main plot of this story.) where they about to change Gene back to normal, but change their mind and decided not do it and then later Gene got captured by robot sending Gene to go after his friend to go save him. After the Smiler defeated, gene try to send the right face before the phone got completely delete and then Alex changed his mind and then decided to keep the phone. Then at the end they did the Dance like they did in Just dance app. Voice actor: they bring the most famous actor like Patrick Stewart, T.J. Miller, Jake T. Austin, James Corden, etc. which was great, but the script was poorly written which give the actor poor effort and feel bad about. Overall: This movie was terrible. Possibly one of the worst movie of 2017. It was Bad written, lack of character development, unfunny, Rip-off, mindless, and boring. This movie was some reasons why this should not be exist in the first place. They got lucky for the box office, however their lucks ran out because of negative reviews by critics and audiences. It could be nomination for razzie award of 2017. Because of that, There's 0% chance to make a nomination for the Oscar award. Strong tip: Don't watch it and also don't buy the DVD.",

            "review_title": "The worst animated movie of the decade",
            "content": "this is honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen. When you look at films like Norm of the North and Foodfight, sure they're bad, but they can still be funny and entertaining to watch because of how bad they are. This is not the case with this movie. This film is downright atrocious and there is literally no enjoyment to be had with it in any sense. Tony Leondis has seriously sunken to a new low, Sony Pictures Animation has entered a new gateway to hell, and Sony can now add this to their large track record of god awful films.I could dissect the story, but whats the point? If you've seen Wreck it Ralph, Inside Out, and the Lego Movie, then there are no surprises for you here. The plot is predictable from beginning to end. There's this emoji that's different, hes shunned upon i guess, he messes everything up, he goes to fix it, he teams up with an annoying idiot and an obnoxious feminist, he learns to be himself, then goes home and fixes everything. DA END. whole movie. No surprise twist, nothing unique. Just a pile of better movies shoved in a broken blender. The conflict of Alex deleting his phone is so contrived and baffles all logic, both with character actions and even the understanding of smartphones. This film is riddled with gaping plot holes as well. Why doesn't Alex turn the phone off or mute it if its causing him grief? Why don't the emojis just go around the apps instead of going through them? How does deleting gene stop Alex from deleting the phone? I could go on for ages about the plot holes, but honestly, they're completely obvious. There's also a god awful message about being yourself that's so shoehorned in that i honestly think I got a brain tumor from it.The characters in this film are horrendous. Gene is boring as hell and T.J miller clearly didn't care about giving a good performance. His character is unbelievably bland and he never goes through any kind of development or change. Hi-5 is one of the most insufferable \"comic reliefs\" i have ever seen. He never shuts up and never makes a good joke. Wyldestyle is an obnoxious feminist that spurts random feminist dialogue that doesn't fit and has literally nothing more to her character (they also make her a secret princess, not only making her a generic edgy teen, but also a bigger ripoff of venelope from Wreck it Ralph) . Smiler is a terrible villain that is just a ripoff of the fairy godmother from Shrek 2 mixed with a bit of Lord Business from the Lego Movie. Genes parents are also boring as heck, yet for some goddamn reason they have their own damn subplot. None of the Actors really cared about their performance. Literally the only good performance in this entire movie was Debi Derryberry as a shy emoji. Too bad that they didn't give their best actress an actually prominent role in this film.The soundtrack for this film is unbelievably bad. they use as much cringey music as they possibly can. The only part about this movie i thought had any effort other than Debi Derryberry was the animation.You can tell that the animators did the best they could to make this film look at least passable for theaters. The only negatives I have with the animation was the premise they had to work with and a couple of animation errors. At least they tried. Keep in mind that i almost never view animation above writing and storytelling, I'm just giving credit where its due.Overall, i think we have a pretty good contender for worst film of the year, and worst film of the decade. If you truly wish to see this abomination for yourself, make sure you do it illegally like i did. That's right, i downloaded this film off of the internet instead of watching it in theaters, a decision i will gladly take to my grave. Do not give Sony any of your well earned money.",

The female lead, I wanted to fling her out a window. She's loathsome. The comedic sidekick was only made worse by James Corden's poor performance. And Eugene, the main lead, was just irritating and unappealing. The comedy is dreadful. The plot, frightful. The little girl I went with fidgeted the whole time; not once did she laugh or smile.

And No, it's not powerful enough to bring you someone for chill...BUT all the reviews are WRONG! This is A GREAT little movie!!! It ALSO tells a GREAT lesson about being who you are, and standing up for what you think is right! Also that as parents, we need to support our children and ACTUALLY LISTEN to what they're telling us! Be who you're born to be! It was funny, fast paced, I love that unlike a LOT of movies, they never broke character, they ACTUALLY made everything accurate and the scenery reflecteda simulated phone! I was impressed with the level of thought that went into it! HIGHLY recommended!!!",

This movie used to be good to me, but after watching it..... 8 times.... it started to make sense.

I doubt that NOBODY laughs when I get to see it. What reality does this movie deserve to exist?! I really want to know, I'm genuinely curious at this point. In this reality, it's conventional wisdom that it takes a sane person to prevent this movie from being made. What am I saying, it's already been made! I've seen bad movies and it never bothers me at the slightest. I'd seen Pixels! Hell, I'd even seen the Ghostbusters reboot! I'd even seen Transformers and not the sequels! Now, I've officially learned by the doing the right thing of seeing Atomic Blonde instead of the Emoji Movie. This animated film with a target demographic of children may get to thank it's \"lucky stars\" every second of every day that whatever the writers sold their souls to was stupid enough to make a quick buck. I think I believe calling it a kids movie is not going to work anymore, because children deserve better instead of being bored. I don't know any movie that would lower itself so substantially to even reluctantly want its demented, poisoned mind around.Just get out of the movies, Emoji Movie and go back to the cancerous sludge you came from, because believe me, it's for your own good! 0/10!",

            "review_title": "Utterly Wretched",
            "content": "Sony Animation Studios have had a lot of big ideas lately, haven't they? Their two most recent contemporary classics hit home for sure. First, The Angry Birds Movie, and second, The Emoji Movie. Similar titles, vaguely similar plot lines and messages, and similar trend of soulless advertisements disguised as children's movies. I'm not going to pretend I had any high hopes for this movie, because I didn't. Sure, animation! Colorful, fluid animation! The only thing Sony is known for nowadays, other than dreadful movies, because they have the money to pump into it. Animation is all well and good, but, like Illumination Entertainment, money only goes so far. It's the equivalent of wrapping fecal matter in sparkly wrapping paper and being surprised and upset when people unwrap it and feel disgusted. So, to the point, I was going to be biased against it just from the subject of the movie, but I couldn't help thinking, in the back of my mind, there has to be at least SOMETHING that might be mildly amusing. SOMETHING that would make sense. SOMETHING that would make me think \"hey, the people who wrote this are, in fact, humans and not aliens wearing flesh sacks who try to gather information from humankind to use it against them\". But no such luck. T.J. Miller, the voice of Gene, the main character, mentioned it was the least worked-on animated film in history. He essentially states there was so little thought, time, and effort put into this flaming tin box of garbage and it shows - on the big screen, no less. The entire experience is so rushed and forced it leaves you wondering why anyone would bother with this in the first place. All the characters follow the exact same archtypes used in most generic animated movies, especially Angry Birds. Jerkish main character, ultra-goofy and agonizing sidekick, evil villain who seems charming and fun at first but turns out to be crazy, and cool, slick alternative chick. (At least we were spared from the last trope in TABM.) Everyone is devoid of personality other than their labels, which is ironic, considering the message of the movie is... be yourself, I suppose? People will love you for you? You'll get what you want in the end and not what you need? If you complain and cry and stomp your feet enough, you'll get a girlfriend, tons of fans, and a lifelong career? Who knows? Not Sony, that's for sure. Everything demonstrated in this movie is presented as an advertisement - and that's what it is, nothing more. It throws Sony-brand smartphones, Candy Crush, Spotify, Dropbox, Just Dance Now, so on and so forth at you because they can. It's shameless and embarrassing. Children won't understand this, parents aren't really going to feel charmed by it, and teens only watched this movie out of pure irony. The target demographic is incredibly difficult to pin down. It could possibly be preteens, but, again, I'm lost. It should be obvious already that a movie barely over an hour long would have plot holes, but this thing is so bogged down with them that it makes me shake in frustration. If Gene has parents, two Mehs, do all the other emojis have parents? Why didn't we see any of them? Do emojis retire once they get old and pass the tradition onto their children? Did Gene's father or mother run the Meh box until the day before Gene would start work? Why did Jailbreak complain about wanting to be herself and be free of rules and restrictions when she was already making a living hacking phone records and lived in a seedy underground app? Why did she say you can only be a princess or a bride in Textopolis when the current emoji library has dozens and dozens of female emojis doing various things other than being tied down by, uh, patriarchal themes or whatever? If leaving apps is so easy, why didn't we see any other characters visit other apps just out of curiosity? Why didn't a young teen boy ever use the eggplant emoji? How is it even a little realistic that a young teen boy would have downloaded Dropbox or a pirating app? Even with all these questions left unanswered, you still get plenty of content that will make you want to tear your hair out. Hi-Five is the most deeply irritating character I have ever seen in my life and he eats a piece of candy after barfing it up. Gene just shuts down and is willing to let emojis die just because Jailbreak didn't become his girlfriend, but he suddenly becomes the hero at the end of the story and Jailbreak goes running back to him anyway, having suddenly returned his feelings because he complained about it, I guess? The robots dab while dancing. Jailbreak keeps speaking in internet shorthand. Sir Patrick Stewart voices the role of a pile of poop and has a maximum of five lines in the entire film. The teen boy gets a girlfriend because the emoji he sends her is \"super cool\". There's no possible way to redeem this tripe. I wish I could give it zero stars, because it doesn't deserve anything. I was even able to give one teeny, tiny nod to Sausage Party just because it might encourage future adult-oriented CGI films that might actually be watchable. But this? This deserves nothing. I hope the creators of this feel bad and I hope T.J. Miller is mocked and ridiculed for the rest of his life. I hope Sony Animation goes under and I never have to think about this thing ever again.",

            "review_title": "The Emoji Movie was a Comedic Fail.",
            "content": "The Emoji movie is about Gene, an emoji that just can't stick to who he is meant to be, trying to figure out who he is. I chose to review this movie because it had a lot of hype behind it before it came out and once it did it, didn't really go anywhere. Also, this movie had a relatively low budget and hasn't made that back yet.The movie takes place in a cell phone and is focused around a series of emojis. The movie starts with Gene, who is questioning who is he meant to be, messing up and making the wrong face when the owner of the cell phone, Alex, tries to send him. So, Alex thinks that his phone is broken and makes an appointment to get his phone reset. The emojis find out about this and the emoji in charge sends some robots to find him and make him be the emoji he is meant to be. As Gene is running from these robots, he teams up with Jailbreak, a princess emoji turned feminazi that is meant to be Gene's love interest but refuses to be a love interest, and Hi-5, the stereotypical annoying fat friend that ends up holding everyone band and causing way more problems. As they run away from these robots they go through many different apps and we learn more about each character as they learn more about themselves.My Evaluation: o Presented on a scale of 1-3 o 1 being the worst o 3 being the best o Some half points may be awardedThe Content/Plot o The plot was nothing new. The troubled teen doesn't know what he is supposed to be, enter daring adventuress. They run away from the villain, get into shenanigans, become good friends, defeat THE villain, find who they are meant to be. o Nothing new. We have all seen a hundred movies like that. So, plot was mediocre in my opinion. o Content/Plot earns a 2/3. Casting o The three main characters were voiced by well-known comedians and the voicing was OK. I mean, the voice actors really tried their best to help this movie. o Casting earns a 2.5/3. AV Quality o The Audio/Video Quality is the best thing about this movie. o The Audio almost always lines up perfectly to the animation. The video is animated in 120 Frames per second and 4KHD. This movie looks amazing. The animation team did a really great job on this movie, especially for having such a low budget. o AV Quality earns a 3/3. Audience Appeal o I watched this movie with my parents and 2 children and throughout the entire movie the kids were bored and wanted to get up and play and the parents were not entertained. o This movie has quite a few jokes but they aren't funny? Like they sound like a librarian wrote them. o This movie fails in the audience appeal department. It is meant to be a funny family movie and it wasn't funny and families didn't really care for it. o Audience appeal earns 1/3. Characters o Main character analyzation \uf0a7 Gene \u0095 Boring. We have seen it before, nothing new. \uf0a7 HI-5 \u0095 Again, the stereotypical fat best friend. Nothing new. \uf0a7 Jailbreak \u0095 A new type of character I have never seen before, but that doesn't mean it was good. \u0095 She was written to be a \"strong independent woman\" but she came off as a feminazi. o Overall, the characters are predictable and suck. o Characters earned 1/3. Product Placement o I wasn't planning on having this be criteria that I analyzed; however, since 10+ products or services were referenced in this movie I can't help it. o There was a scene where the main characters jumped into the *newly released* Just Dance App and basically promoted the app for 5+ minutes. o They also jump into Candy Crush, Spotify, Twitter, YouTube, etc. o So many product/services mentioned in this movie, almost unnecessarily. o Product placement earns a 1/3. Overall Score o 10.5/36 o Average score: 1.75/3.",

            "content": "The second the movie was over, I was dumbstruck, and I wasn't the only one. When the movie ended I thought there would be a big round of applause but when I turned around I saw that about half the audience was still in their seats. I looked at a couple of people, some were speechless and most were crying. Nonetheless I didn't hear a word. When I thought about it, i realized an applause would have been ridiculous. When someone asked me how the movie was I was going to say it was amazing, but that wouldn't have done the movie justice. The movie was an extremely moving, emotional experience. As a non-Christian who nevertheless respects the historical figure of Jesus Christ and the beauty of his philosophy and teachings, I found The Emoji Movie to be a powerful portrayal of much that I think is worthwhile about the Christ story. I know the film has been maligned for anti-semitic content (perhaps because Gene make mistakes in the film and are seen as the villain instead of the hero), and for various other problems - but let's face it - any movie portraying this subject was bound to face strong reactions. And kudos to Tony Leondis for not shying away from the subject by creating a sterile, gutless, Disney story out of what really was a good example of the everyday horror of life on the fringes of the millennial empire. Leondis invents a new genre with The Emoji Movie - that of historical horror. The performances in this film are inspired. I felt that the film brought out the cowardice of the apostles very forcefully, and the courage of Gene life was palpable to the very end. I also felt that the voice acting from James Corden was one of a kind and compelling - almost making me believe that he was truly a Hi-5 in real life! Final word - this is not a film for the whole family nor is it a feel-good film. Don't see it if you're not willing to confront the worst aspects of human nature up close. And don't go in looking for your own version of the story - it's not your film! This is what Tony Leondis believes, and it's his own revelation, not necessarily to be shared by all.",

The jokes were not funny and some of them felt like they were trying to be funny but failing miserably, I did smile or chuckle at a few. There were only 3 jokes in the movie that made me laugh but most of the times I laughed was with me and my friend making jokes about the movie that were funnier than the movie itself. I don't get why this movie exists, Emoji's aren't relevant anymore, It try's to appeal to the \"younger\" audience by using Emoji's but look at the gross of the movie and you can see they failed. There was literally no one else in the theater so Sony messed up big time. It also felt extremely similar to the Lego movie (which is a amazing movie) I mean there were robots trying who look the exact same trying to kill the main characters, and the character Wlydstyle and Jailbreak look exactly the Same!!

And it's all pop songs made for kids under the age of 10.Acting- Dreadful, they hired some random celebrities and cast Patrick Stewart as a poop emoji.

            "content": "When I say that the emoji movie never should've happened, I'm not saying that like \"Sony never should've made this crap\", I mean that the PLOT of the movie quite literally makes no sense, and almost all of the obstacles that were faced could've been easily avoided.So for those of you who have managed to read this far, The Emoji Movie follows the life and adventures of the \"meh\" emoji, Gene, who makes the wrong face when the phone's user, Alex, is trying to send a text to the girl he likes (Addie).The \"emoji council\" or whatever you want to call it, decides that it's best that Gene be deleted because he is a malfunction, and deletion robots are sent after him. Somewhere in Gene's escape from said robots he is united with Hi-5. This is where the plot nosedives into hell.I'm sure that nearly every person who sees this movie can agree that the characters are painfully unoriginal. Gene is your typical protagonist in a \"I just wanna fit in\" situation, Hi-5 is the dumb sidekick who doubles as the comic relief, and Jailbreak is so awful she deserves her own paragraph.So Hi-5 tells Gene that he can be fixed by Jailbreak, a hacker, but they've got to find her in the piracy app. They leave Textopolis (I know it's bad), find Jailbreak, and are then attacked by deletion robots but manage to escape to Candy Crush (ad).It's in the Candy Crush scene that you realize how \"Mary Sue\" Jailbreak really is. To everyone in the movie she is seen as flawless. She randomly says things like \"Men are always taking credit for things girls do\" and \"I'm not some princess waiting for her prince\". In the Just Dance scene she claims she can't dance so Gene encourages her, and less than two minutes later she's a fantastic dancer. She is a textbook Mary Sue with no likable qualities, and every single time she opened her mouth I had to hold back from audibly groaning.So now there comes the most crucial flaw with the movie: it should've never happened. I know this is a kids movie, and a child would probably never notice such a thing as I'm about to explain, but it's lazy writing and deserves to be called out.Below is a list of obstacles that the group faces throughout the story:Piracy App - To get Jailbreak. Eventually chased out by deletion robots. Escape to Candy Crush. Candy Crush - Just an ad for Candy Crush. Just Dance - Literally just an ad for Just Dance. Deletion robots soon show up and drag Hi-5 into the trash with them. Trash - Get Hi-5 Dropbox - Try and fix Gene. Also an ad.Another important thing to note here is that these apps that they travel through are all set up like rooms with hallways dividing them all. You do not have to go through multiple apps to get to Dropbox, you'd just have to walk down a hallway to get to Dropbox.So technically, the only apps that the three HAD to go to were the Piracy app to get Jailbreak, and the Candy Crush app because that's how they escaped to robots. So please tell me WHY ON EARTH they then proceeded to go through Just Dance AND the trash (which they never would've had to go through if they hadn't been in Just Dance). It's stupid. This movie should've been a game of Candy Crush and a leisurely stroll down a hallway, but instead Sony had to make things complicated.Along with this awfulness comes the horrific subplot involving the marital problems of Gene's parents, Mel and Mary (who are also both \"meh\" emojis). Imagine having to sit there for five to ten minutes at a time, listening to nothing but monotone voices. That's what this subplot is. A whole bunch of boring. I'm not even going to go into detail on that one because it's just too boring for me to talk about it.So now there are some tiny nit picky things that bothered me: - \"Emojis are the most important form of communication\" (actual quote) - The idea that words aren't cool anymore - A text conversation between Alex and Addie is shown early in the movie, and it consists of nothing but random emojis that make no real sense, just proves how lazy Sony is. - Poop jokes aren't funny and never will be. - A \"phone store appointment\" event added to the calendar on Alex's phone is what tips off the emojis that they're being deleted. How did they get \"we're being deleted\" from \"phone store appointment\"? - You don't need to go to the phone store to have your phone reset. - There is no such thing as a phone deletion machine. - The conflict (the phone being deleted) is resolved when Gene makes multiple faces and sends this magical face changing emoji to Addie. - Addie assumes that this one emoji that changes faces represents Alex emotionally and tells him that she's glad he's one of those guys that can \"express his emotions\". It's an emoji. - Addie and her friend are casually chilling in the phone store while Alex is deleting his phone. Why? - Why is Addie not weirded out when she receives nothing but one emoji out of the blue from some guy ten feet away from her? - She clearly see's the phone is being deleted, why doesn't that make her question whether or not he actually sent it? - The whole movie ends with a clich\u00e9 dance party.All in all, please do not see this movie. It's bad enough that it went up from a 0% on rotten tomatoes, and I really don't want to see an Emoji Movie 2 in the future.",

There was some references that older viewers could relate too and everyone in the Theater seemed to enjoy the movie with plenty of laughter. The only reason I didn't rate this movie a 10 was because of some feminist comments that were made. Of course children wouldn't understand it but it's irritating that many so called writers feel compelled to include some form of male bashing or feminist propaganda in a movie. These movies would be so much better if they left the male bashing out but it seems if a movie can't be full of cussing they stick feminist comments into it. Why can't a movie be made without having to bash a gender or race. There was only two comments made, one was slightly offensive but the other was a highly sexist feminist comment. Nothing like making a children's movie only to put a few male bashing comments in it like we don't already have enough of that in commercials or the PG+ movies.",

I love the good bad funny movie and thoroughly enjoy scrolling through Netflix looking for some pathetic excuse for a movie. But this is just boring. The pineapple pen joke is not only a year old but boring, \"the plot twist\"is predictable (at least in my opinion. My friend who I forced to sit through this with me did not predict it) and the moments between Mary and (I forgot the dads name because he is so irrelevant) is pointless as well as their fight.

They also canceled a Popeye movie for this garbage, which is truly disgraceful. Moving on to the content of this movie, let me start with saying it includes a plethora of unfunny poop jokes and puns that you can see coming a light-year away. If the writers believe their targeted audience would find their jokes humorous, then the writers are incompetent, immature five-year-olds. The plot is as barren as the surface of Pluto. There are no relevant plot twists and you can predict the exactly how everything is going to end, so I'm not sure if anyone can have the movie spoiled for them. The character are all empty clich\u00e9s. A hero with no personality. Check. A comic relief. Check. A love interest for the hero. Check. A generic villain. Check. Every other character in an irrelevant one-liner. What were the themes of this movie? That's a tough one. All I could think of is... express your emotions?

Second of all, the characters. They're the blandest characters I've seen all year. Gene is the generic \"guy who is different than the rest who is accepted in the end\", Hi-5 (who's idea of a name is this?), \"the comedy relief who is annoying and as hyperactive as a 3 year on sugar\", and Jailbreak, the \"hardened chick who is kinda of a feminist that would fit in well with the Tumblr crowd of edgy 20 somethings\" Also, there are other characters who are completely one dimensional and only used for \"teh plot\" and/or comedy.

            "content": "May be spoilers for this \"movie\" ahead. Where do I begin, with the festering pile of sh*t, that is \"The Emoji Movie\"? Well originally I went to see this thing (it does not deserve the title of \"movie\") with my friends as a sort of joke, as we already knew it was going to be garbage, but we did not expect it to be quite as bland and mind-numbing awful as it was. When we first walked into the room, we stuck out like a sore thumb amongst a sea of 7 year old's with fidget spinners in their hands. We knew already that we had made a mistake. When the movie began I already felt my faith in humanity slowly ebb out of my body. At the beginning we are introduced to our main emoji \"Gene\" he is a \"meh\" emoji and is about as interesting as a sack of flour, he proclaims many times, to keep the attention span of the brain dead children, that it is his first day on the phone he repeats this to practically all he meets in some failing effort to make the audience care. When he finally makes his way to the main building, after explaining what every pathetic little emoji's job is, he proceeds to laugh at a meaningless and unfunny sight gag that in turn shows us what makes \"Gene\" special, he can express different emotions, his parents happen to see this and pull him aside into the bathroom and explain to him that making the wrong face is bad, or something, which then makes \"Gene\" upset and he comes out with some spiel about being unique and \"different\". The only reason they are in the bathroom is so we can hear Patrick Stuart's character, \"Poo\", make a joke about how he is a walking pile of sh*t. Gene storms off (I've used the quotation marks enough) to start his first day on the phone. In this scene we are introduced to the villain and Gene's friend simultaneously \"Smiler\" and \"Hi-5\" (haha loll because it like text language) who is a walking hand, about as interesting as you can imagine. So Gene is picked by their user Alex to be sent to his girlfriend Addie McAllister ( Who came up with that name \"Addie\" like the h*ll?) Long story short, Gene messes up and is told that he must be deleted or sent off the phone, or some stupid cr*p like that, by the Villain Smiler. He runs into James Corden's terrible character Hi-5 again (keep in mind these two have only met twice for the first time in the space of ten minutes) who helps him escape Smiler's evil army of anti-virus bots. The most awful scene in this movie has arrived \"The loser lounge\" where the writers out of thousands of internet jokes to choose from, and they chose the throw away \"bye Felicia\" joke. Hi-5 and the yellow one talk about their stupid little reasons as to why they need to leave textropolis, so they try and enlist the help of a hacker called \"jailbreak\" (loll like wat u do to your phone, this movie hurts me) by going through a stupid piracy app and she agrees (who knew?) After this there's a load of awful product placement that I'll skip over where they mention going to the cloud,for yet again for some awful reason, along the way James Corden's character is kidnapped (thank God) and they go and rescue him. Because friendship is beautiful. Alex is getting progressively more annoyed with his phone after it turns on twice during class (oh no how awful) so he decides to go and get it completely wiped. So the villain, Smiler, thinks capturing and killing the yellow one is a way to solve this problem, so she sends out a bigger version of one of the awfully designed anti-virus bots. Which is sure to do the job. It doesn't. They escape again and finally get to the fabled Dropbox where the cloud is held. So they can do something about making themselves better (great lesson to teach kids \"if you aren't perfect the way you are, completely change everything about yourself!\") They get there, jailbreak and the yellow one realise that they love each other, she rejects him and it breaks his heart, and he finally became the meh he always wanted to be. He gets back to emoji land and Smiler still wants to kill him (I wanted to squash him like a bug long ago), and the dad trust to stop her, then the mum but they both fail, (wow, who knew?) Smiler is defeated. But Alex has already brought his phone to be wiped, so they need to find the perfect emoji to send to Alex's girlfriend before he wipes the phone, like that is gonna change jack sh*t, and guess who they send? Gene because he has all the emotions, or something, it works, AddieMcKillme comes out with this laughable line, \"You're one of those guys who can express his emotions, I like that\", which is ironic considering half of the movie is about convincing you that emoji's are much better than stupid 'ol, uncool words. Alexa decides to stop the phone from being wiped, and super, happy, fun, mega dance-party proceeds. The end. Don't ever go to see this money grabbing, \"kids\" movie, as it is guaranteed to leave you soulless and wishing for death, hope you enjoyed my review!",

            "content": "(Warning: Contains Minor Spoilers) One does not watch a film like The Emoji Movie expecting anything but corporate pandering from a company as vile as Sony. However the film somehow managed to be worst than my expectations. Considering I have seen both The Nut Job and Minions in theaters, saying The Emoji Movie is the worst animated film I have ever seen, and one of the worst films I have ever seen, shows that the true quality of this film. What's the plot? Gene the emoji wants to become \"meh,\" as he is a malfunction. After destroying the emoji center, Smiler, who is simply annoying, wants to kill Gene. Gene finds a useless comic relief named Hi-Five, who leads him Jailbreak, a hacker emoji that has extremely forced character traits. You can assume that along the way there will be poop jokes, jokes that are so bad you don't even know they're jokes, bad outdated references, a void of likable characters and emotion (ironic for a film centered around emojis), forced feminism, a romance between meh and female meh that is focused on for around 20 minutes,and scenes, like the one centered in Just Dance, that are so blatantly awful and go on for so long, you will want to bludgeon yourself multiple times. Whenever you think the film can't get worse it does, and by the third act, my friends and I laughed so hard, since the ending was so nonsensical, pandering, and followed every clich\u00e9 you've seen in other awful kids movies, like the ending dance sequence, except they are executed worse. One may say there are worse films than The Emoji Movie, and there probably are. And by that I mean there may be a few films worse than it. But the mentality behind this film, created from a greedy company that wants to create low-effort garbage to exploit a young audience while having the audacity to also make fun of that audience, as lazily as one could. This company pushes back reviews to allow films like this to do well, and says that the film isn't bad because it is made for a certain age group. This company has no purpose, other than to leech off of your money, and to continue releasing mass quantities of terrible films, like The Star, and potentially Peter Rabbit. The day Sony goes bankrupt will be happy day for all of humanity. Let's hope that day is sooner rather than later.",

Kids are unlikely to notice, but there's some 'so bad it's good' novelty for the older viewers. Overall it has okay character and message, that even adults can quite enjoy and get somewhat immersed in. It's overall, very OK. I would rate 5 star if it wasn't so ridiculously full of product placement and their 'strong female character' is quite forced. (Seriously, strong women don't need to constantly reassert how strong and independent they are...) The message of this movie? USE DROPBOX PLAY CANDY CRUSH AND DDR AND DID YOU KNOW DROPBOX IS SECURE? Oh, and be yourself and accept everyone for who they are. Gene, the main character is a 'meh emoji, and that reflects the movie. It's just meh.",

If, in the future, the human race were to look back at our past achievements and judge whether or not we were on the right track, they'd most likely assume we were in the dark ages again, only this time with emojis.\nThis movie has no merit, no redeeming qualities and no enjoyment to be had while watching it. This 90 minute endurance test serves only as product placement and an advertisement. If you went to the theatre to watch this movie, you'd probably have a hard time telling the difference between the pre-movie ads and the movie itself. That would also mean that you paid for that experience, and for that you have my sympathy. \nThey actually somehow got Sir Patrick Stewart to voice a role in this movie, and his character was, quite literally, poop. Delivering some of the laziest poop jokes that Hollywood has ever written, I guess even Picard needs the money. This movie is absolute trash, not even worthy of being taken into a tip or a landfill, just atomically disassemble the entire thing and launch it into space where some alien colony will find it and eradicate it with lasers. \nThe Emoji Movie made 217.8 Million dollars at the box office with a budget of 50 million dollars. Economists suspect that this movie will serve as a catalyst for another worldwide economic crash, and I for one welcome it.\nThis movie actually won awards and were nominated for some others, some of which were more deserving. It won worst picture, worst director, worst screen combo and worst screenplay. It was also nominated for the Black Reel Awards, Movieguide Awards and Kids' Choice Awards, for whatever value that's worth. \nI don't think I can actually get away with simply saying that this movie is bad, everyone knows it. You know it, I know it, the people that made this movie know it and even the people that were paid to give these movies good reviews especially know it. Things need to change. We need to riot.

Or perhaps the very existence of this film reminds me just how banal, insipid, and base Hollywood's process of filmmaking has become. Rather than attempt to break new ground by trying something new with a new IP, Corporate executives, in their never-ending obsession to never take any risk, have birthed this cosmic terror upon the universe. This movie is the Foodfight of a new generation. There is no artistic merit to this movie, no philosophical message to convey besides the usual schlock one inserts into a children's movie such BE YOURSELF, YOU'RE SPECIAL, and all that drivel which might hit home in any other movie. This movie only exists to be a 1-hour and 31-minute advertisement. This film wastes substantial time with parts that suffer cancerous inclusion of real world apps, such as Spotify, Instagram, Just Dance, and Dropbox.

No. But is it a terribly bad movie? Also no. Kids (about age 8 and under probably) will be entertained and adults may be mildly amused at a few of the jokes. Anna Farris was really cute as the Jailbreak character and High-Five, while slightly obnoxious at times, was actually pretty funny. The plot has a few logistical problems, but most all movies do.

Just because it looks okay doesn't make it any better. Plot: The plot of this movie has been done to death and is similar to beating a dead horse. (The plot is that everyone is normal except for one guy who is different and that makes him \"weird\", so he possibly goes on a journey to become normal and at the end, he realizes that being different is what makes him special.) There are so many other movies that do this plot and handle it much better than this \"movie\" does. (for example, Wreck It Ralph)Product Placements: There are so many product placements (for example, Candy Crush, Facebook, Twitter, Just Dance, Dropbox, Spotify, etc.) that it's intrusive and a cheap series of attempts at capitalizing on the audience that uses these apps. In other words, the ludicrous amount of product placements makes this film The Advertisement Movie. (as I like to call it.)The Characters: The characters (as far as I know) are bland and don't really get any character development at all. The hacker emoji character is a rip-off of the character Wyldstyle from The Lego Movie, which is much better than this waste of money.Conclusion: Do not watch this film, you would be better off spending your money on any other movie that is not this one. Do not watch this movie, all it will do at most is that it might keep the children awake but even the children will probably get bored and ask to leave the theater and go back home. In other words, anyone who reads this review (and even those who don't read it) would be better off watching paint dry for about 90 minutes and giving their $10 (or so) to charity.Final Review Score: 0 out of 10 (if it was possible to give it a 0 on this site.)",

This is just one of the many things that don't make any sense att all.The one thing that really annoys me with this movie is how it presents teens like idiots who can't communicate using words and they need emojis for that. And of cource they use their cell phones all the time. Especially in the end when Addey says to Alex something about him being a man who can express his feelings because he send a emoji which contains more than one expression. Come on!Anyway if you just want to see a movie and have like never seen one before you might not get bored because this can't offer you anything you haven't already seen in a movie. Expect emojis. That's why it's called Emoji movie.",

That is totally messed up. The PopEye Movie Trailer looked like a real movie trailer! But this emoji movie trailer was about like a piece of garbage, SONY wasted all their time making this. Sony thinks they are making money.... FROM younger aged uneducated children. Learning how to use emojis? Total messed up, I wished this movie ever existed, This was the worst thing that can happen to children's human life. I hope you understand. Also one thing i forgot. They are really overrated because Sony wants the viewer to use a lot of emojis. Clearly, my point is that this movie is a waste of time. Do not waste your money on this stupid piece of crap.

Its storyline is clear and compete, although the story is quit simple, but I still enjoyed the movie. To have another example to compare, I would say this emoji movie is better than Smurfs 3 as well, rating 2.3/10 on IMDb is defiantly underrated and unreliable.

            "content": "This time a lot of people got it very and awfully wrong with this movie. Having seen that this movie was going to be about product placement they instantaneously hated the movie before it even came out. Then why should they watch the movie and be open for what the director was trying to do? Why should they see what the movie was about, what was it trying to transmit as a message or if it had a good-enough story or well designed animation or good musical score?Since their minds were already made they decided to hate the movie anyway even if the movie was somewhat good... as is the case in which I though it was. This was a very fun and entertaining movie that without the product placement in it (for which I didn't give one cr*p about) it's actually a fun movie with a great message for both kids and adults.I tried to watch this movie with the most opened mind I could and I though the movie's message about self-discovering, the animation, the humor, the voice acting and the musical score along with the story were actually very good and in no way deserving the rating it got here or from the critics.I would even go so far to say that it was better than Inside Out. At least this movie sanded a clear message while that pixar flick was all over the place when it came to transmitting a clear message to the audience.In conclusion go watch this movie and read as few things about it as possible because behind these bad reviews is probably an agenda going on against movies with product placement. If you can forget the product placement for an hour and a half you'll enjoy this movie!",

Plot kinda lacks about why this movie is about emojis, and somehow the movie plagarized ideas from other movies I liked, such as The LEGO Movie, Wreck it Ralph, and Inside Out. Basically I'll explain more here. So basically about Gene and his friends setting his journey to go on an app adventures? That literally doesn't pretty mean about why this movie is about emojis. In the other hand, Jailbreak, the tritagonist of the movie, is nothing but a ripoff of Wyldstyle from The LEGO Movie. Smiler, the antagonist of the movie, her design makes it an uncanny valley to it, making it pretty creepy. The story itself, is really boring and unenjoyable. In the other hand, really bland and confusing to understand about (especially bland and confusing about why this movie is about emojis). So there you have it, The Emoji Movie is what people definitely didn't enjoy and ask for.Overall, this movie deserves to get a D-Movies like The LEGO Movie, Wreck it Ralph, Inside Out, Spider-verse, the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie coming out in April 7, 2023, and Smurfs: The Lost Village (the Sony pictures animation film that preceded this trash movie, even though this doesn't mean I hate this Smurfs movie) are better in general than this piece of coal.",

The only good thing about this awful movie was Mal and Mary Mah and how for along time were mah emojis.

Sony pictures pumped out yet another offensive, low-budget pile of crap that is about as investing as watching paint dry. This is a bit-by-bit review of The Emoji Movie.The plot is lazy and very clich\u00e9. In the movie, Gene, who is a \"meh\" emoji, wants to go to work in the smartphone as a meh emoji. He must make this expression to beam a \"meh\" emoji up to the phone. However, (oh no!) he makes the wrong face. Wow, exciting. Smiler, the ruler of the emojis, wants to kill Gene because he sucks at his job. However, Gene thinks that everyone hates him because he is unique and goes on an adventure to make him a \"meh.\" He meets Hi-5, who is the \"comic relief.\" The reason that I put quotes around \"comic relief\" is because he is not actually funny. He is just the kid-pandering random goofball that adds nothing to the story. In order to complete his quest, Gene hires a hacker, Jailbreak, who is the blatant feminist character. I even remember a specific line of dialogue from her: \"Women are always inventing things that men are taking credit for.\" Subtle there, Sony. From there they wander into the Just Dance app and play Just Dance for an atrociously long scene which is a blatant product placement. Repeat that last sentence, but replace \"Just Dance\" with \"Candy Crush\" and you have the next 5 minutes of the movie. From there they get to their final destination, Dropbox (another product placement), and there Gene says that he loves Jailbreak. She turns him down because she doesn't want to be defined by the man she marries. I am dead serious. I would tell you about the ending to the movie, but by then I was so bored and saddened by this movie that I fell asleep. Sorry, but I hope that this much has convinced you to keep your $10 and do something better with it, like flush it down the toilet. Offensive, horribly written, terribly voice-acted, and blatant feminist messages, The Emoji Movie is the worst movie I have ever seen.BURN IT WITH FIRE BURN IT WITH FIRE BURN IT WITH FIRE",

I marched little Timmy to the car, drove to the nearest cinema, and purchased two tickets to The Emoji Movie. Rest assured, he will never call Todd anything ever again. Or sleep at night.

This is a kids movie but it keeps filling their head with the bad stuffs. We are shown teenagers use their phone 24 hours a day, even at class, and that's something kids should not do. And it's only the B-plot of this movie. The main plot doesn't deliver bad messages to kids, but it makes us feel really bad. The plot is so unoriginal, in fact it made me feel like it's a phone version of Wreck-It-Ralph. While Wreck-It-Ralph is based on video games, this movie is based on THE LITTLE FACES THAT WE USE WHILE TEXTING! Did they run out of ideas? Who thought this would be a good idea for a movie? The plot is so boring too. The jokes are so unfunny and cringy it made me facepalm so many times. Candy Crush in 2017? PPAP on YouTube in 2017?In conclusion, don't watch this movie.",

I found myself chuckling with amusement throughout.For many reasons, I actually liked this better than similarly-themed animated movies like Inside Out, Wreck-it Ralph, & The Lego Movie. For instance, it's less pretentious than Inside Out, and it doesn't suffer from the excessively frantic short- attention-span pacing of Wreck-it Ralph or The Lego Movie.Visually, The Emoji Movie even has a few instances of artistic brilliance, such as its beautifully imaginative renderings of Instagram, Spotify, & The Cloud.As for the haters (critics) flooding this movie with low scores, realize that their hatred is largely not truly directed at this movie itself, but at the culture it represents. Really they're only using this movie as a springboard excuse for scoffing at the modern youth culture of digital communication, social media, smartphones, etc. It's the grumpy old man syndrome of mocking any aspect of culture that's new, popular, and likely unfamiliar on a personal level, because they may not have grown up with it. It's why nostalgic themes such as classic video games (Wreck-it Ralph) or classic toys (The Lego Movie) get showered with higher ratings, despite being similarly themed, no more clever, and no less silly than The Emoji Movie.",

There are some interesting parallels with the real world as well: Gene has to be \"meh\" just like his parents who are \"real pros\". But instead he has a special ability to express many feelings at once which is treated as a \"malfunction\". One real story I can recall was about a kid who was incredibly talented dancer but could not focus in class and was nearly diagnosed with ADHD. We force kids and people in general into some sort of boxes and if they don't fit we consider it a disorder, a \"malfunction\", something that is not cool and should be fixed. This animation movie teaches little kids to be themselves and freely express themselves. Old idea but good nonetheless. This is great.\nWhoever left extremely low ratings are probably sad people who cannot see anything good in life. Maybe the storyline wasn't great and the director wasn't good but there are good things about this anination and you cannot seriously be that displeased with just about everything.",

The movie was actually better than I expected. Most importantly, my 6 year old and 9 year old truly enjoyed it and came out so happy afterwards. That's what matters most. I would personally rate the movie between a 6 -7 stars, however a 9 is well deserved to try and bring it back up with all the negative ratings. This movie really has a positive influence on the child's mind. I may even buy it on DVD as well. * This movie did have similarities to another movie we really enjoyed - \"Inside Out\".",

The doctors have question me why I always have wrist cramps, and then I tell them that they would know if they had watched the Emoji Movie! I will sacrifice myself to the Emoji Movie when it tells me to with its beautiful, majestic voice AND NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE SAY, IT WILL, I KNOW IT WILL!

Gosh, thinking about that moment when everyone stood up and clapped brings me to tears.This is truly a work of art, a cinematic masterpiece. Forget about The Godfather or The Shining or any other movie that fails to live up to The Emoji Movie when in comparison.I recommend this film, giving it a 10 out of 10 because no other movie can place products as obvious as The Emoji Movie.",

Please do not read this review if you have not seen the movie!Now before anyone who hates this movie jumps on my back, I just want to say that I can understand the hate. When the trailer came out I thought the movie was not going to be that good! I looked into the movie a little bit more and I thought \"Maybe it might not be that bad after all!\" When I saw the movie, I thought \"That was good!\" This is my opinion on the movie, I can say what I like! Also, I'm not one of those people who gave this movie a sarcastic review. I'm being serious! Without further a do, lets get into the review!\"The Emoji Movie\" is about this emoji called Gene who has more than just one emoji. He can do multiple emotions when all other emoji's have just one. He wants to get fixed so he teams up with Hi-5 since he wants to get back in the cube too and a hacker named Jailbreak.There were some parts that I actually found enjoyable to watch! Examples of these scenes are Just Dance, The Candy Crush scene and many more! What I liked about the Just Dance scene is that they used good music and the dance movies were again enjoyable. The JD sequence was great in my opinion! I'm also a JD user myself so I really enjoyed that sequence! There was also a dance sequence at the end which I also enjoyed watching! I also really liked the animation and the characters! I thought they were fantastic! :DThere were, however some parts that I would like to see some improvements on. An example of this is the jokes. The poop jokes I did not laugh at because that is not my type of humor but there were other jokes (that were not poop jokes of course) that I quite laughed at. The plot line is quite predictable too. However I did not really mind if it was predictable or not.Overall, this movie was good! Some parts I would have loved to have seen being improved but I enjoyed it! You can go ahead and disagree with me but this is my opinion. For this movie, I'm giving it...8/10",

My favorite part was when the hand ate his own puke, classic humor that never gets old. The plot is fairly simple, our main character, Gene, is a meh emoji. Gene struggles to fit in because he has dynamic emotions. Gene then goes on a quest to become static, and that concludes my review",

            "content": "To start this film was a true masterpiece of filmmaking with beautiful visuals and an inspired, original and truly gripping story. This must be one of the best made films since the invention of motion pictures, seriously, Hitchcock, Nolan and Spielberg are put to shame by this cinematic experience which clearly takes influence from French New- Wave cinema and the work of German Director Uwe Boll. Along with the spell-binding cinematography the picture is companied with side splitting humour, an example of this is between Gene and a Coffee cup emoji. The scene goes down as follows: Gene walks by and says 'Hello tea.' The coffee then replies, 'I'm not tea, I'm coffee.' That's it! Probably the best joke shown in cinemas in the past decade. This humour is as amazing as it is thanks to the stellar voice cast led by (Deadpool star) T.J. Miller, (Alvin and the Chipmunks Actress) Anna Farris and (Talk show host) James Cordon with a brilliant supporting cast including Sir Patrick Stewart (Masterfully cast as Poop), Maya Rudolph (Smiler) & Jake T. Austin (The highly relatable teen: Alex). Also, special commendation must go to Jennifer Coolidge and Steven Wright as Mary and Mel Meh (Respectively) who hilariously manage to keep up their monotone 'meh' voices for the whole film. The story itself has previously been compared to Wreck it Ralph and The Lego Movie however these reviewers are obviously just petty little man babies who can't notice art when they see it. The film's only issue regards the lack of payoff after the huge build-up of sexual tension between Gene and Jailbreak this is made up for, however, through Jailbreak's reasoning for (SPOILER) not reciprocating Gene's love. This shows a great move forward in the acceptance that women are not damsels in distress and love objects for white (or yellow in this case) men. The film is blessed with the enthused soundtrack of the greatest pop songs around and the relatability to its audience by using the current top trending YouTube videos: PPAP and I Like Trains. Finally, although primarily a comedy the film has two scenes that brought a genuine tear to my eye. I won't spoil the scenes but they involve Gene's parent meeting in Paris and something/someone getting deleted. In conclusion, this chef-d'oeuvre of cinema manages to simultaneously be a brilliant comedy, a heart-breaking love story & a time capsule representing everything 2016/17 stands for.\ud83d\udcaf/10",

The embarrassment Alex feels in the real world shows Gene's true inner torment. There's also an underlying theme of the DABDA scale, where Gene seems to be going through all 5 stages. It's hard to put everything into words, because this movie is so impressive for being for kids. He's clearly going through so much and i will continue to analyze this film further on later watches.

Meanwhile, the phone owner is deleting each app one by one, and is planning to delete the whole phone, and it's up to Gene to save his world.It's a good movie, but the reason it gets an 8 and not a 10 is because, well, the story is rather clich\u00e9d, being the tale of a misfit that somehow saves the day, but this is easy to be overlooked.

You can't say a work of art has bad editing, writing or score music! Its best to just leave it alone as it's own being and not give it a rating. It's like going up into the beautiful Himalayan mountain range and giving the view a 7/10 and height a 10/10 and the temperature a 5/10, it just doesn't work and it makes no sense.

There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase \"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

            "content": "THE EMOJI MOVIE MARKS A NEW ERA IN ANIMATED CINEMAThe critical panning of the recently released \"Emoji Movie\" says more about the polarization between the elites and the populace then the quality of the film itself. Just one cursory glance at any \"review\" of the film that has been recently shoved down the throats of the public in a self-righteous attempt to shape the minds of the people will reveal just how distant the raving troglodyte we call the \"film critic\" is to the rational and well-tempered human that we all are. After viewing the film for the first time recently, I can safely conclude that the Emoji Movie must and shall be the stepping stone toward a society in which either the elitists are cast from their throne of pretentiousness by the common-folk, or cast out of society altogether, voluntarily or by force.The film opens with the \"Columbia Pictures\" logo (the one with the woman carrying the torch), only for the expectations of the consumer to be completely and violently subverted by the revelation that we are looking at this logo not through the lens of the projector, but through the lens of a cellphone's camera, as the frame zooms out to reveal that someone is taking a photo of this woman using the Snapchat app. Such a subversion of such a classic logo primes the audience for a spectacle that the consumer, and not the snob, can relate to. Gone are the days during which we must fabricate a fondness for dated symbols such as this woman and her torch. 1928 (the year of the logo's inception) was 89 years ago. We no longer wear stolas and carry torches. We have had electricity for over a century! Why should we feign amazement for such useless and inefficient technology as a torch? Only the most pretentious of film reviewers could take issue with this appeal to the masses. The day that we can finally live in the present has come; its name is July 28th, 2017!IMDb didn't let me post my full review; so go to http://www.picklesrevil.com/emoji.htm instead, as I am forced to abridge my review here.",

In the end it's a story about a defective emoji who really wants to fit in and be like the rest of his peers and family. It's heartwarming that he learns that being different is not bad; very similar concept to Wreck it Ralph. The journeys through the apps are exciting and really capture the essence of the apps, bringing a sense of liveliness to applications that we only get to see through a flat screen. During the entire film you get to experience various emotions and two major climactic scenes which revolved around deleting of apps and data. There were few parts of the movie where you lose interest or aren't really sure what is going on but it was overall really a fun experience. Conclusion \nThe collaboration of animation, technology and new social norms have evolved to create an opportunity for this movie to exist. It was overall a great fun movie to watch for adults and kids.",

I also loved that after one of the three main characters \"die\", the other don't really seem to care and have a conversation about what they think of life.

It's really not that hard to see why. Let me break it down for you.1.) Plot.Gene is a meh emoji, in a world where everyone only has one emotion. Gene, though, has multiple. This proves a problem when on his first day at work, he messed up. The villain, \"Smiler,\" tries to delete him because of it. He escapes her, teams up with \"Hi-5,\" and finds \"Jailbreak,\" a hacker. They go on an adventure through apps, like Youtube, and Just Dance, which, by the way, is now free for IOS and Android. Eventually, their user, Alex, gets tired of apps being triggered by the trio, so he schedules an appointment to get his phone wiped. Fortunately, Gene and the others save the day.2.) JokesOne of the only flaws of the movie is the humour. In the first 10 minutes, 5 poop jokes are made. I wish it was more. Another joke is that Gene's parents, also meh emojis, speak in the same monotone voice. It never gets old. Throughout the whole move, I was rolling over with laughter.3.) RatingI give the Emoji Movie a 10/10 because I realize that the Emoji Movie is the most original movie out there... People are all about Transformers 5, or Thor 4, or Spiderman Whatever, but I'm about Emoji Movie 1. It runs very smoothly, at a good 1080p HD 160fps. Also, as I already stated, the jokes are GREAT. The story is moving, it really is an Emoji-nal roller-coaster. And the spy attack really fits the scenes. Speaking of music, I forgot that the Just Dance App is now free for IOS and Android.

They run into many complications and grow as characters.I don't understand the hate surrounding this movie and frankly I'm insulted and confused why anybody would feel that way, I thought it was a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I couldn't stop laughing throughout the duration of the film. I enjoyed it incredibly. It was immersing, I related to every character on a deep emotional level, the main character Gene (played by famous actor T J Miller) seemed to grow so much and by the end it was like seeing the achievements of my own child. I loved the strong female character, it was great to see feminism portrayed I such a great way. Hi-5 was so funny and his design was humorous.Now let me tell you about the plot. This movie was deep, I found myself completely immersed and time seemed to fly. By the end I felt like a different person, this is so much more then a children's movie. I'd recommend to anybody to go see this movie. It seems like it will become a classic like pulp fiction or back to the future in no time.

Well, I will give it an Awesometacular.",

However, this excitement was overshadowed by creeping doubt. What if the poop emoji was not given a complete character arc? What if the culturally diverse sushi Emojis were whitewashed and misrepresented by white actors? And what if corporate executives censored the socially important two-men-holding-hands Emoji?All doubts were dismissed upon viewing this cinematic masterpiece. The creators' respect for the Emoji community was evident in every frame of this immaculate work of art. I laughed, I cried, I sat on the edge of my seat, I repeated steps 1-3 countless times, and, finally, I emerged from the cinema a changed man.

The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages. While there are subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the Poop emoji going to the toilet,\" that amuses children. The amazing cast of The Emoji Movie, including TJ Miller and Sir Patrick Stewart do a great job of living up to expectations.

I truly wish that it were longer, that I could prolong this poignant emotional experience. The character development is movingly evident by the end of the film, we watch these emoji characters grow as individuals and its a beautiful thing to experience. The Emoji Movie, while targeted at children provokes the responder to recognize an underlying darkness set within the film. Such is conveyed through the surrounding impending mortality that this film uses as its basis. It reminds us that we too face the threat of mortality and that in itself is a truly moving notion that strikes the viewer completely unawares and allows the film to boast a more mature foundation that only true artists could pull off via the challenging medium that is feature film.

From a teenage point of view this doesn't sound like a very gripping plot but I did find this movie quite enjoyable for what it is. Despite the film being marketed for kids it still retains some jokes that teens may find somewhat funny. I will admit the product placement at times is a bit cringe, like with the candy crush and just dance portions of the film but fair play to James Corden he actually puts on quite a good show despite only being a voice of a character. I will admit however I felt sorry for Gene (the meh emoji) when he was rejected by Jailbreak as you could defiantly tell their was some kind of sexual tension between the two, despite being a kids film. I have a few criticisms, first off I am pretty sure the eggplant emoji gets used a hell of a lot. Also Sir Patrick Stewart has really gone down hill in my mind due to him playing as a poo instead of some of his more major roles in films like x men.Overall in my option the emoji movie is an OK kids film and people need to remember that this film is a kids film and not a Hollywood mega film (despite the 50 million USD budget) that is aimed for all. I will admit I went with low hopes to this film but was shocked at the fact I enjoyed it. All in all the film is OK for what it is but nothing that special. I would recommend this film to young children and teens. However don't go and see this film if you are expecting a masterpiece.",

The few reviews I read seemed to want to find some deep meaning in this cute little cartoon. If they just watched the movie for the fun hourish it is, rather than getting into their own minds, the reviewers might have had a fun time.

            "content": "*Spoilers*The Emoji Movie is a thrilling and exhilarating ride through Just Dance, Candy Crush saga, and YouTube. Sadly the Tinder app did not make the cut, which would have added some more depth to the enjoyable world that Gene, Jailbreak and Hi-5 exist in for all us viewers to enjoy. First off, I'd like to talk about the controls. The Emoji Movie runs a solid 69 fps, which is better than I get on Overwatch every day, which is lovely. One of my original fears was that there would be an incredible amount of input lag, but thankfully. There was none. The Emoji Movie has around 20 ms of ping which is not bad. It's great! The controls were very responsive. Overall, Symmetra is still OP.Now I'd like to talk about the plot. I love the inclusion of the Just Dance app which for anyone who didn't know is now available on any IOS or Android device. Unfortunately, tinder (my favorite app) was not included in this wonderful piece of mastery. I was hoping that Gene and Jailbreak would fall in love over tinder, but the way it happened was fine I guess. Pen Pineapple Apple Pen was a wonderful addition, which many people to this day still know and love. Absolutely wonderful scene that was.Finally, I have only one piece of criticism. Sorry for the nitpicking. I was very upset to see that \"It's Every Day Bro\" was not included in this masterpiece of a film. I was very sad to see my Dad's music video not make the cut. However, I was very happy to see that the movie ended in a giant dance party. The song choice I believe could have been better (Maybe \"It's Every Day Bro\" would have fit better). But it's good to see all the characters rejoicing after their depression session.In COncLuSIoN, this film was absolutely incredible. Emojis down, the best movie I have ever seen. Anybody who disagrees can be banished the the fiery pits of the team 10 house. Thank you for reading my novel.",

Let's attempt to break it down, though.Our heroes in the film are Emojis, but it really doesn't matter what they are, but rather, what they represent. Like Inside Out, Toy Story, Winnie the Pooh, or virtually any other kids film, the main characters are simply personifications. Their outward expressions and the world's expectations for them to keep those expressions is social commentary on how people are supposed to act in public, or in their professions. The Meh emoji represents inner turmoil at believing there's more out there than the safe expectations of society, he is an explorer, and societies differences give him depression.People have also complained about the plot about needing to reach Dropbox. Dropbox is yet another metaphor, just masked in something relevant to the setting. Exactly like Mount Doom in Lord of the Rings. It's an adventure story with plenty of heartfelt, meaningful messages and diverse, colorful charactersThis is Man vs self, man vs. faith, man vs destiny, man vs society, and man vs industry, depending on which character is focused on. The characters are well-rounded, as they all have individual character goals, motivations, and growth, all of which aren't without healthy flaws that act as obstacles to get them where they need to be right away.Hate for this movie makes no sense to me. It's relevant, the visuals and animation is pretty great, and a lot of thought was put into making it smart all around",

If that bothered you, I don't know why you would have watched it in the first place!I enjoyed the movie from minute one. It is very imaginative and at times poetic. Throughout the whole story I just found myself smiling and feeling good. Definitely a good pick me up if you are feeling down. The movie focuses on Gene, an emoji in a boy name Alex's phone who is destined to be the \"meh\" face. The twist is, unlike all of the other emojis in the phone, Gene can make multiple faces which ultimately makes him an outcast and the target of deletion. The real star for me in this movie is \"jailbreak\" (aka the princess emoji) who is played by Anna Faris. Dude, excellent choice giving the role of the most adorable emoji in the movie to one of the most adorable women in existence. I am not sure I would have liked it as much as I did if she was not the voice of this character. It is very poetic and ironic that Gene wants to be in the box being who he is \"meant to be\" while Jailbreak wants out of the box and has tried unsuccessfully to escape to the icloud. Gene's speech to her before her rejection caused him to be truly \"meh\" was very touching. I found Gene's friendship with Hi-5 to also be very enjoyable. Gene's parents were also unintentionally hysterical. One of my favorite parts is when Jailbreak and Gene are sailing on the \"streams\" and each one represents a different song. That is very clever! In the end, Gene's unique emotions is what finally gets Alex noticed by his crush Addie and he decides not to delete his phone for \"malfunctioning.\" It reminded me a lot of Wreck it Ralph and Inside out.

The Emoji movie falls in the above trap. Even I think there was nothing new in the movie but that does not mean it isn't good. It has some good laughs, Some tickly, some Funny, some heart touching moments. The Movie is paced fantastically. There is never a dull moment in the film. The Emoji theme base is just brilliant. All in all it is a terribly underrated fun movie not made by Pixar or Disney.",

Such a low score should surely be reserved for an absolute catastrophe of a movie. This just isn't the case here.So, something must be going on here for the IMDb review score to be so wildly off kilter. This is not down to taste. The movie has a start, middle and an end. It has twists and laughs and characterisation. The (music) score isn't terrible and the plot is solid (though not exhilarating). So, why the low overall IMDb score? Could there be something in this movie that control freaks don't want you to see?Well, let's see...there's a constant threat of censorship/ deletion (sound familiar?). There are jibes at; social media; bots; the class system; spam; virus's; disgusting trolls; and so much more. It's also anti-establishment, so...yeah...there's that \ud83e\udd14. (The false 3.3 score is starting to make sense now, huh?)\nThe movie shows us a 'robot-type boardroom executive' with no soul. Perhaps the insincerity of this character reminds the low raters of themselves...? Maybe, maybe not.The main character is named Gene. Was this chosen by accident? The main character is encouraged to 'be himself', how dangerous in today's world...\nPerhaps the entire movie is just too close to the bone... I don't know. I just know it's not a 3.3.I was compelled to write this. So many nonsense reviewers. The truth is, the movie doesn't go far enough.I say 'well done', to the makers of this cartoon. It entertained me and my 6 year old kid....which is the demographic that the movie is aimed at. So, are the kids of the low raters not enjoying this movie? I doubt that.",

When I see the low ratings people give this movie, rather than feeling angry - I feel sorry for these people. I understand why the ratings are so low, not everyone is capable of truly understanding a film as metaphorical and nuanced as this. It isn't your fault if you couldn't comprehend what Tony Leondis was trying to do, but I do hope you begin unpacking your preconceived biases that make you unable to fully understand and enjoy hard hitting queer films like this. Sony truly made history by giving us such a realistic and heartwarming depiction of gender fluidity, and it's obvious that this is something close to their heart as shown by their more recent movie \"The Mitchells vs. The Machines\" which features a lesbian main character. Sony is taking it upon themselves to bring us the important queer films that other animation studios are too scared to make, it's extremely inspiring. I hope any of you that thought The Emoji Movie was simply a lazy attempt at making money by taking something extremely prevalent in our society (emojis) and throwing in some poop jokes - will try watching it a few more times. Me and my peers regularly get together just to rewatch The Emoji Movie, taking in all the details, oftentimes making lists of new things we didn't notice before - and then we discuss it together, sharing our revelations and the new lesson we've learned (because no matter how many times we watch it - The Emoji Movie somehow manages to teach us something new each time). I'll have to wrap up my review now, lest I go on forever. Though personally, I think of this less as a review and more as a love letter to the greatest film to ever grace our earth, and I urge everyone of you to watch it again with an open mind - it may surprise you.",

The film is such a masterpiece that I am inclined to believe that it was animated by artists, voice acted by the jost prestigious singers, written by the most brilliant philosophers and directed by the most intelligent and creative man in existence. The Emoji-Bop will stick with me throughout the rest of my life and i would love for it to be played at my funeral.

This is not your typical comedy movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. \n\nThe film's storytelling is some of the best ever seen in blockbuster filmaking, combining smart writing, intimate character moments, and exceptional world building to create one of the best blockbuster stories ever. The superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with James Corden, Patrick Stewart, and T.J Miller in particular turning in some of the most human and enduring acting preformances I have ever seen. In addition, Patrick Stewart once again proves utterly breathtaking as \"Poop\". Further proving that \"Poop\" is definitely among the very best movie villains of the last century.\n\nThe action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. The world renowned final battle of this film is riveting, heartbreaking, awe inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of it's kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER hear.",

I was flabberghasted! \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab I was in a complete state of shock. \ud83d\ude35  I started sobbing \ud83d\ude2d uncontrollably until I PASSED OUT!!! \ud83d\ude34  THIS. MOVIE. \ud83c\udfa5 THIS VERY MOVIE that I used to \ud83d\udc79 DESPISE...  Put me into an 8 month coma. \ud83d\udca4\ud83d\udca4  And I could NEVER, \ud83d\ude2c and I mean NEVER, be more grateful. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udd17 The second I woke up, I was still crying. \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22 The movie gave me clarity \ud83d\udc40 about everything I needed to know \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd28 in my life.  It was absolutely lifechanging.  I will never be the same.  Because the Emoji \ud83d\ude42 Movie TRANSFORMED my life.  The part when Meh \ud83e\udee4 was about to die, \u2620\ufe0f and all of the Emojis teamed up to save \ud83e\uddba him, gave me ACTUAL goosebumps.  And don't even get me started on when Boss Lady \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbc tells him that she accepts him for who he is and that he doesn't always have to be a Meh.  I bawled \ud83d\ude2a my eyes OUT at that part.  \n\nSo, Emoji Movie producers, if you're reading this, I want to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart.  You are true miracle workers.  This. Movie. Changed. Me. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude01\u263a\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd79",

            "content": "To be honest, I saw The Emoji Movie only to understand why it gets so much hate. As a Redditor I understand why I am supposed to hate this movie (because...emojis?), but why does the normie audience hate it? Isn't this movie supposed to be like, their dream come true? Don't they always keep spamming emojis in all their sentences when writing a message or making a meme? When the movie hadn't come out it was being advertised a lot, so I thought people are supposed to be excited. Even the animation of this movie seemed really good. But I watched it and now I know the problem.\nThe Emoji Movie is very ignorant. It talks about emojis as if it is supposed to be something very cool. In reality only elders, women and children use emojis when they message (because they are the only ones we can't slap some sense into). But then again the target audience here is the children. So considering this movie is from their point of view, emojis are supposed to be shown as though they mean a lot to them. So let's come to the second point. The emojis are shown to have their entire personality revolving around their expression. Why can't they just be doing their job? Also how come so many emojis look similar? Is it like only one of them goes to the emoji keyboard while the others have no business? There are so many questions that the movie doesn't answer.\nI don't know which problem plagues this movie the most. Is it the product placement? No, it just gives a feeling of adventure. None of the product placement looks as much on the nose as everyone describes. Like in TVF Originals they straight up speak out to advertise the things. Here at least Gene and Hi-5 are going to those places to see what is happening over there. I kinda found the Candy Crush part funny and relaxing at the same time. There was also the Just Dance part, and that was definitely cringy. But that was the only cringy one. Facebook, Skype, Drop Box - everything else was quite decent.\nThe jokes weren't half as bad, considering this is aimed for kids. Even I used to make many poop jokes when I was 13. If there even was anything bad, the animation and music compensated for it. The idea that there are so many emojis that we can establish and entire world using it is actually something I'm guessing everyone must have thought at some point. The one part that I surely felt was cringy was when the kid gets to ask out his crush because he sent her a custom emoji. Only if life functioned that easily. Hi-5 was also pretty disgusting. Every time he kept his hand (thumb) down it used to hurt me. Imagine bending your thumb down that much. Also when he ate the salivated candy I felt like vomiting.\nThe Emoji Movie is a bad movie, yes, but it's still better than many animated movies I have seen. Food Fight, Delhi Safari, Roadside Romeo, Geng: The Adventure Begins, Pangaa Gang, the entire Super Bheem series - there are plenty of examples of animated movies that are even worse than this. It does have redeeming qualities, even if they are not enough to make this a genuinely good movie. I can imagine the animators must have worked hard on this movie even if they didn't agree with the script. And that is the reason why I have massive respect for them.",

He does not give good messages, he only treats children like fools, he makes his audience believe that everything in life revolves around social networks, it seems that the only purpose of this thing is to encourage the chamitos to spend 24 hours of the year stuck in a cell phone.\n\nThe human protagonist does the most ridiculous thing in the world: believing that his cell phone is bustling him, instead of just turning it off or putting it on silent mode, he decides to erase everything. And the fact that he tries to conquer the one he likes with pure emojis is absurd. (I would like in real life to draw the attention of the one I like with little faces xd)\n\nHe literally has the girl in front of him, he could tell him by talking and that's it. It seems that in that world all adolescents are stupid, do they not know that there is a real life outside of social networks?

However, I was practically clawing my eyes out over the sloppy plot, mostly unlikeable characters, odd dialogue, random plot jumps/jumping to random side plots that have no actual meaning, and mostly forgettable scenes. The only thing the movie had going for it, besides the crap ton of celebrity voice actors (because every single animated kids movie nowadays just don't survive without the celebrity actors), is the animation. It's Sony, the animation is going to be at least somewhat good.\n\nAfter watching this a second time by myself, just to make sure that what I saw the first time wasn't just me having a fever dream, it became very very clear to me that, even with their 50 million dollar budget, something went horribly wrong. Either the animators weren't given enough time (which I doubt because the Emoji Movie took 2 whole years to make), or the writers didn't know how they could make a movie about emojis that would actually work in the box office, which is understandable.\n\nI assume that the Emoji Movie was made to try to appeal to kids or teens by, of course, having emojis as the main characters. But, that was already a big mistake. as my older kid who confirmed that kids and teens nowadays rarely ever use emojis, but rather emoticons. In the movie, the emoticons are referred to as the elderly, which I assume makes enough sense. There's no real way to fix this though, as an animated movie all about emojis or emoticons would still be a huge failure, no matter what.\n\nOverall, this movie was destined to fail the moment it began production. After viewing the movie twice, I thought to myself, 'Man, Hollywood really screwed up this time. I hope they'll be able to fix themselves up down the road.'. I thought that Hollywood would learn their lesson and not do that again, and for the most part, they did! But then, CATS happened. Oh god, was that movie an absolute disaster. I haven't watched it, and I never will, but from the trailers alone, that movie honestly scares me.",

Sounds fun, right? NOPE. I even thought when first seeing the trailers for this movie that it could've had potential, but decided to waste it all with a terrible storyline that steals from other movies, characters that give the movie an extra mean-spirited lair, animation that doesn't even look professional at all in comparison to other movies Sony has produced, terrible humor and worst of all...CONSTANT shameless advertising. I thought that it could've been a good movie, but ended up being referred to as THE WORST animated movie in the 2010's decade, and maybe even one of the worst movies of all (even outside of animation) of the 2010's decade. 1/10 for the story, 2/10 for the animation, 1/10 for the characters.

            "content": "Is the first animated Razzie Award winner The Emoji Movie the worst film of the year? Gene (T.J. Miller) is the \u2018meh' emoji inside a kid's iPhone who wants to be a wide variety of expressions. Once he accidentally glitches the phone, he crosses the threshold and exits Textropolis with his band of misfits Hi-5 (James Corden) and Jailbreak (Anna Faris), going through all sorts of Apps like CandyCrush, Just Dance, Spotify, and Dropbox, to escape from the bots hired by Smiler (Maya Rudolph). The obvious message in the film is that technology connects people together, so buy an iPhone and text an emoji to show your love for another. Hearing that flimsy and gimmicky moral, I saw The Emoji Movie as a 90-minute commercial for Sony products, with all the features installed such as a half-baked story, uninspired characters, and obnoxious puns, but colorful imaginative worlds. As for Alex, the phone's owner who sends a text to let go of his comfort zone, he is no Riley from Inside Out. The boy is just as dreadfully boring as all the other phone-ridden schoolmates, including his girl crush, and the apps and emojis don't do much to support his character arc. Also, the film missed an opportunity to have the emojis escape the phone world and enter the WiFi network, where they might accidentally damage the system causing chaos in not just the school but the world. This could have been a unique children's satire tackling the impact of technology among humans. However, The Emoji Movie and Sony exist to only advertise trendy electronics rather than glorifying the art of cinema. (1 \u00bd Thumbs Down Symbols out of 5)",

There's something special about the English language we find and his skills with it. They express things or at least he does in ways you can understand but otherwise would never know about offhand, at least me being from the US. I loved the message of the main character, as well, excellent job by the actor. One of my favorite parts is the mechanical or robotic purple/blue-ish dogs. I felt offended by some of the messages in this movie, still, like maybe I wasn't as exciting as Jailbreak or I had problems like the main character presented.

This movie reminded me of an 1988 film, called Mac and Me where it is a extremely terrible film because of:\n-Poor acting\n-noticeable terrible advertisement\n-Just bad and boring. \n This Movie did have a couple things I like (Out of 1 hundred success criteria. 11/100.) like smooth transitions, and it wasn't too boring. and THAT'S IT. That's why I'm giving it 1 star, besides my usual 1/2 star. If you've seen Wreck'it Ralph and Inside Out, + a bad ripoff movie (Mac and Me) You've already seen this movie. If this movie were a person it would be ugly. If you like this movie. you need to see Wreck-It Ralph and Inside Out.",

I blame myself.\nI blame you, too.\nI just wanted to be supportive.\nYou just wanted a vacation.\nYou take that back, Mel Meh.\nBots.\nIf they haven't found Gene by now, he must have skipped town.\nYou mean the Wallpaper?\nOur boy's on the run.\nHow about we find him ourselves?\nYeah, for sure.\nTell all Bots to follow those Mehs.\nI'm sure they'll know all the\nfreaky-deaky apps Gene will hide out in.\nI'm really good at making plans, you guys.\nRight?\nHere we are. The Piracy app.\nThis is where we'll find Jailbreak.\nUm... But this is the Dictionary.\nThat's just what Alex wants his parents to think.\nThis is called a skin.\nReally? What could a teenage boy\npossibly want to hide from his parents?\nJust try to keep up. This place can get a little rough.\nAhoy, mateys.\nLook who's back!\nHi-5!\nI'm a bit of a celebrity here. Always welcome.!\nLoser!\nCome on. Follow me.\nGreat. Emojis.\nI thought the conversation just got dumber.\nInternet trolls. Just ignore them.\nEventually, they'll get a job or a girlfriend\nor some sort of purpose in life, and they'll stop.\nVirus. We'll just... We'll just walk over this way.\nHi! It's so great to see you again.\nDo I know you?\nIt's Spam. Just sign here and I can get you special discounts on vitamins\nand credit card offers that can save you up to 25%.\nNo, no, no, don't get sucked in.\nBack off, Spam!\nIt's the only way to deal... Back off!\nThank you very much!\nYou can illegally download our CD right here.\nHey, Trojan Horse. How are you?\nYeah, what'll it be, hand?\nI'll have a bottle of \"Hack Daniel's.\"\nMaybe with a plate of cheese and hackers?\nYou trying to find a hacker?\nYou can just ask, you know.\nSorry. Um, yes.\nWe're looking for a hacker named Jailbreak.\nI know a guy that can hook you up.\nRight over there.\nHe looks capable.\nNo, not him. Her.\nWait. He's a she?\nHey, Jailbreak.\nMind if we join you?\nYes.\nThat's the thing about the Internet, isn't it?\nYou can never tell if someone's being ironic or sincere.\nI sincerely, unironically want you to go away.\nThat's a good one.\nSo, here's the thing. My friend Gene here has a little problem.\nWell, see, I'm supposed to be a Meh,\nbut I don't really feel...\nRight. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nNo, that's good. And we thought\nyou could help, since you got the Princess,\nyou know, off the phone.\nNot interested.\nHold up. That's not a Meh face.\nBots! They're after me!\nHow are you doing that?\nLook, it's just something I can do. Can you help us?\nFollow me.\nBots! Delete my history!\nI corrupted the entire hard drive.\nI made the most delicious cinnamon buns.\nMaybe if there was something to, you know, jog my memory.\nCome on! Move!\nHey, Trolls, why is that mailbox wearing a tuxedo?\nHi! It's so great to see you again! Call me!\nThis tunnel will get us out of here.\nMove!\nDid that cloud taste sweet to you?!\nHelp me! Help! I'm stuck!\nSweet motherboard!\nWhere am I?\nGet me out of here.\nHey, Palm Face.\nTry getting him out the top!\nAlready on it!\nHold tight, Gene.\nThis feels very odd, and it smells.\nI mean, it smells good, it smells delicious, but I still don't like it.\nThe game obviously thinks you're a candy,\neven though you're weirdly misshapen, you know?\nWhat are we gonna do?\nStay very still.\nDon't worry. We've got your back. Right, Hi-5?\nHey, Fingers! You want to focus?\nFor your information, I happen to have a sugar addiction,\nand it's a very serious...\nListen, Finger Head!\nWe have to get Gene out of the game without blowing him up.\nI don't want to blow up.\nWe have to match up the candies,\nso that Gene will drop to the bottom.\nAnd we can't match him with any yellows, or else...\nDon't do that. Please don't do that.\nWatch.\nMatch three in a row.\nDon't blow Gene up. Got it.\nAnd we have to be very careful.\n-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Careful.\n-Candy!\nWatch it!\nHey!\nNo! No, no, no! Slow down.\nNot the yellows! Not the yellows.\nI said careful!\nMy mom just joined Facebook. Can you believe she wanted to friend me?\nHey, Addie, I was just wondering if you are...\nTasty.\nWhat?\nUm... Excuse me?\nSweet.\nHey, Addie!\nHi, Nikki.\nSee you later, Alex.\nSugar Crush.\nSo over this.\nWireless Wireless. How may I help you?\nI'd like to make an appointment.\nIt's like this phone is playing games with me.\nHey, what does this do?\nNo!\nGet me out of here!\nNo! Stop it! Stop, stop!\nIt's not working.\nWell, there's one option left.\nWe line you up with the yellows.\nBut you said not to do that.\nSpecial candies get transported to that jar.\nThe game might think you're a special candy.\nAnd what if it doesn't think I'm a special candy?\nWell...\nJailbreak, hello? Hello, Jailbreak?\nSorry.\nWhat if it doesn't think I'm a special candy?\nI'm not too worried about it.\nOkay, just do it.\nGene!\nGene?\nHey. No!\nGene! You're alive!\nYou were trying to see if I had somehow\nturned into candy, weren't you?\nYes, I was. And you have not.\nHey. Looks like something popped up on Alex's calendar.\nI'm sure it's nothing.\nAlex made an appointment at the phone store.\nNo!\nCalm down, everyone!\nCalm down.\nDon't worry. Everything is fine.\nMaybe Alex just wants to buy some accessories.\nHis appointment is with technical support.\nWell, I'm sure we still have plenty of time to figure this out.\nHis appointment is for tomorrow.\nThen maybe it's just for some routine maintenance.\nActually, it's to erase the phone.\nListen, Gene, I'm about to become your knight in shining armor.\nYou are?\nYeah.\nBut first, we need to get uploaded to the cloud.\nThat's where we'll find the source code to reprogram you.\nThe cloud?\nIsn't that off the phone?\nDing, ding, ding, ding. You got it.\nYeah, the cloud. Off the phone.\nWe're in Candy Crush, obvs.\nI know a shortcut to Just Dance,\nwhich is right next to Dropbox,\nwhere we can get uploaded to the cloud.\nOf course. Just Dance, then boogie over to Dropbox,\ncatch the link, and zoom.\nHold up. Here's the stinker.\nBefore they let us into the cloud,\nwe have to get past this firewall.\nThe firewall uses face identification.\nYeah, the firewall.\nWhich is really annoying, because I've already tried to get through.\nGuessed wrong once, and now I'm locked out for life.\nLocked out for life?\nYou're thinking, 'cause I can make different faces,\nthe firewall will think I'm different emojis.\nYeah.\nI wanted to say it 'cause it was my idea.\nYou know, women are always coming up with stuff\nthat men are taking credit for.\nYou know what...\nWell, then let's hit the road.\nHi-5, you coming?\nI'm coming!\nWhy do I always think I'm gonna come around on black licorice?\nMy precious.\nHey! Move it!\nCertain death, here we come.\nLet's try this one.\nYouTube?\nWhat a visual treat.\nAnd I don't even need a remote.\nThat guy is so expressive.\nHe reminds me of Gene.\nYeah. Something really wrong with him.\nOur son is a malfunction,\nand you should never have let him go into that cube.\nDon't blame me for this, Mel.\nI am hopping mad at you.\nSee?\nMary, I think we're being followed.\nBut don't overreact.\nI told you not to overreact.\nWhat are you doing now?\nThey'll be in there for hours.\nMary, where are you going?\nI think we should go our separate ways, Mel.\nI thought I knew the Meh that I married,\nbut maybe I don't.\nBut, Mary...\nThis tunnel will help us avoid the Bots.\nThanks for helping us. It's really nice of you.\nNBD, dude. The truth is, you're helping me.\nCome on, let's move it. Why so slow?\nHi-5, stop. Why are you getting so close? What's with you? Back off.\nCan't stop now. I'm having a sugar rush!\nI'll go around you. If I stop moving, my heart's gonna explode!\nComing through, Jailbreak! Look out!\nHey! Watch it, Knuckle Butt!\nI can't feel my face.\nSo, Jailbreak, back there you said I'm helping you.\nI've been trying to get past that firewall for months.\nCome on, come on!\nThe faster we get there, the faster I become a favorite!\nLook at me!\nI just want to bounce out of here,\nget off the phone, and live on the cloud.\nWhat just happened?\nYou don't like it here?\nThere's so many rules here. What is up with that?\nThe cloud is supposed to be amazing.\nThere's so much to see and do.\nSugar crash.\nI can't hold on anymore.\nCatch me, Gene. Catch me!\nAnd you can be whoever you want.\nThanks.\nYou're free! Come on!\nMy gosh, my hands are sweating.\nYou are a hand!\nYeah!\nYou know, come to think of it, I don't really remember\nthere ever being a hacker emoji.\nUm, you know, you're taking up too much of my brain space.\nLet's keep the chitchat to a minimum.\nSomeone likes you.\nWhat are you talking about?\nThis is just like when Peace Sign gave me just one finger.\nI knew she was in love with me.\nLet's go!\nI'm never eating another piece of candy ever again.\nHi-5, don't do it.\nDon't you do it. It's already been in there once.\nDon't do it.\nAre my fingers getting fat?\nI'll tell you what, this bandage wasn't so tight before.\nOkay. We get through this app, and Dropbox is right on the other side.\nWe just need to keep it super DL in here.\nAnd no matter what, we can't turn it on.\nOMG, this turned it on!\nWhat? I'm a hand. It's a big, red button.\nWhat's happening?\nNo, no, no, no, no!\nWelcome to Just Dance!\nFollow my moves and you get to move forward.\nDo the wrong moves and you get an \"X.\"\nThree strikes and you're out.\nOut? What does she mean by \"Out\"?\nDigital death.\nThanks to you, Fingers. Now we're gonna have to dance our way out.\nWhich is all right with me, 'cause I can shake it like Michael.\nOr Michael's glove, anyway.\nAre you ready to dance?\nThis is bad, Gene. I can't dance. I got no groove.\nCome on. Everybody can dance.\nNot me, okay? I'm really stiff.\nSee? I can't... Don't understand.\nOkay. No, no...\nStop, stop. She has to stop.\nI see now what you are saying. Just follow her moves.\nReady to dance in three...\nThis I can't do.\nTwo...\nDude...\nJust shut up and...\nDance!\nIt's too easy! Hee-hee! Shamone!\nJailbreak!\nI got you.\nLook. Just feel the music.\nExpress yourself.\nThrough dance?\nYeah, you got it! Go, girl!\nNow throw some sauce on that dance burrito.\nI'm doing it!\nI'm fully nailing this dance!\nYou got it!\nGreat job! You're moving on to free dance!\nImpress us with your moves to move forward.\nMore dancing?\nYou're killing it, Gene! Slay!\nNice! Shake it, Gene. You won't break it.\nWait a minute!\nI've never seen that dance before.\nWhat's it called?\nUm... The Emoji Pop?\nI love it!\nWhat? You do?\nEverybody, do the Emoji Pop!\nHoo!\nYes!\nPrincess.\nYou're the Princess emoji?\nYou never got off the phone.\nWelcome, new players!\nWhat?\nWho?\nNo!\nWe got to go.\nDon't worry.\nThey're robots. They can't dance.\nDownloading funk protocol.\n\"Can't dance,\" he says.\nMove!\nCongratulations. You're a disco diva.\nHey, Alex, you gonna dance for us?\nAlex, that's extra homework for you.\nHey, Alex, you gonna shake it?\nNo! No, no, no, no, no, no!\nAlex must be deleting the app.\nWatch out!\nWe got to get out of here.\nCome on!\nThis song is my jam.\nHi-5, come on! Let's go!\nHurry!\nHi-5!\nGene!\nI got you!\nGene...\nHi-5!\nGene.\nHey, wait. Where's Hi-5?\nAlex trashed the app.\nAnd Hi-5 right along with it.\nWait, what? Wait, trashed?\nHi-5 is in the trash?\nHe wanted to dance.\nBut I knew it was a bad idea.\nWe got to get him out of there.\nGene, Dropbox is right here. That's our ticket to the cloud.\nAnd the trash is on the other side of the phone.\nWe don't know how many other Bots are out there.\nI'm sorry.\nNo way. We can't go without Hi-5.\nI don't care how far away it is.\nThat's my friend down there.\nI'm not just gonna leave him to get deleted.\nWhat? What is it?\nI've always just thought you got to look out for number one.\nWell, what good is it to be number one\nif there aren't any other numbers?\nOkay.\nI'm sorry. This is my malfunction.\nI just... I can't be meh about anything.\nThis is why I'm going to get reprogrammed.\nWell, it's actually kind of cool.\nWait, really?\nYou know, I think I know a shortcut.\nWe can take the music streams in Spotify.\nLet's go give that big hand a hand.\nCome on.\nAlex trashed the Just Dance app, and our Bots are offline,\nand it's giving me a real headache.\nI am so angry.\nI really need to stay happy.\nCan we please lighten the mood?\nNo one can resist una fiesta!\nNot that happy.\nWe've only got four hours before Alex's phone appointment.\nIf they find a malfunction on the phone, we are all gonna be wiped.\nYeah.\nShe said, \"Wiped.\"\nAim higher, Steven.\nI didn't want to have to do this,\nbut it is fun to press buttons.\nThe illegal upgrade.\nNow that makes me happy.\nI just want to dance.\nDance, please.\nArr! Quiet, you sassy gypsy.\nWhere am I?\nHi! It's so great to see you again!\nYou're in the trash, Fingers for Brains.\nGet away from me, Troll.\nHi!\nIt's so great to see you again!\nI got to get out of here.\nYou can't.\nAnd at the end of the day,\nthe trash gets emptied, and we're all gonna die!\nNo. No, no!\nThis is the last face you will ever see.\nNo!\nThis is Spotify?\nYep.\nEvery one of those streams is a different song.\nIs it safe?\nYeah!\nAre you sure this is a good idea?\nFastest way to the trash, dude!\nCould we at least pick a calmer stream?\nOkay, buzzkill.\nAlex. A bunch of people are hitting the promenade.\nI think Addie might be there, too.\nThat's perfect!\nI have an appointment down there, anyway.\nI've got to get this phone fixed.\nHey, bubble butt.\nYeah, you do.\nMuch better.\nSo, I got to ask.\nIs it true that when a princess whistles,\nbirds fly down from the skies, and...\nHello, stereotype. That is a complete and total myth.\nI'm sorry.\nDid you realize that on the first emoji set,\na woman can either be a princess or a bride?\nThat's why I need to get to the cloud,\nwhere you can be whoever you want to be.\nGet ready. Whale song coming.\n-Wait, wait. Whale what?\n-A whale song.\nFrom Alex's biology presentation.\nYou're not gonna see that sitting around in a cube.\nIt's funny. You want out of the cube, and I want in.\nGene, if that means you can't be yourself, what's the point?\nYou know, I think you're pretty cool just the way you are.\nWe're gonna need this.\nIn the trash? Me? I used to be somebody.\nHere I am. Look. In an old e-mail Alex never sent.\n\"Addie, blah, blah, blah, blah, bla-la-la-la.\"\nAnd then there's me, Hi-5,\nright there, doing my job.\nFYI, nobody cares about you.\nJust leave me, Troll, and let me die\nin this dump alone.\nLet me look for the world's smallest violin in here,\nso you can play it.\nIt's the Hand Angel of Mercy. She's finally come for me.\nGive me your hand!\nI mean, give me yourself.\nTake my hand, angel.\nI'm ready to take my place amongst the other great hands of the past.\nIt's me, Gene!\nGene?\nI got him!\nTake me with you.\nHi-5!\nLet go of me.\nDon't leave me down here!\nYou were wrong, Troll. People do care about me.\nAnd I'm not upset, Troll.\nDo you see how not upset I am?\nGene, you came back for me.\nYou saved me.\nIt wasn't just me. Jailbreak helped, too.\nAnd she's a hugger. Give her a squeeze.\nNo, no, no.\nThere really is nothing greater\nthan the feeling of being truly free.\nYou filthy trolls, I inhaled your stench,\nbut I was once one of you, so I, too, feel your pain.\nNow go. Be free!\nShould be smooth sailing from here.\nGene.\nGene.\nGene?\nAre you Instagramming?\nWhere is my Gene?\nMary.\nYou've really done it this time.\nNo, you haven't.\nMel?\nWhat are you doing in Alex's trip to France album?\nI was looking for you.\nNone of this is your fault, Mary.\nIt's mine.\nWhat do you mean?\nIs that a tear on your cheek?\nIt's my fault Gene is the way he is.\nI have other expressions, too.\nI think they've just been buried away.\nBut with Gene going missing and thinking I might have lost you, too...\nMel. Why didn't you tell me?\nI didn't know myself.\nRight now, I'm so overwhelmed with passionate feelings for you.\nMary, my love for you burns with the intensity\nof a red-hot flame.\nI like that, Mel.\nLet's go find our son.\nTogether.\nWe'll always have Paris, Mary.\nSo, you're a princess.\nI saw your little tiara. Very fancy.\nIs it true when a princess whistles,\nbirds fly down from...\nThat's what I said!\nNo, guys! That's a stupid myth!\nWhat software version are we living in?\nGo read an e-book.\nEducate yourselves.\nJust look behind you.\nWhat the...\nWhat is that?\nSmiler must have upgraded her Bots.\nLet's get out of here before it...\nHi, Gene. Remember me? Smiler.\nI'm coming to you live from the amphitheater.\nWhy don't you come back to Textopolis\nand we can talk through our differences, okay?\nMy friend here will escort you, all right?\nI'm gonna see you soon, buddy. Bye, now.\nWe're actually gonna delete him in front of everyone.\nPsst! It's still on!\nIt's still what?\nJiminy Sassafras!\nMove!\nSeparate!\nTangle him up!\nJailbreak!\nGene! This way!\nIt's still after me!\nLet's go.\nWe have to make it to Dropbox.\nYes!\nNo!\nGo low!\nDon't worry. It can't get in.\nIt's illegal malware, and this app is secure.\nCome on.\nWelcome to Dropbox.\nYou are about to leave the phone.\nRemain seated, please.\nYou might want to hang on.\nWhy do they call this Dropbox, anyway?\nThis is why! I see that now!\nYeah!\nI think we're about to see that candy corn again!\nWe made it.\nHoo!\nGuys, guys, chill. We still have to get past that.\nHoly...\nYeah.\nHello.\nWelcome to the firewall.\nHow may I help you?\nAll right, here goes.\nWhat do I do?\nSit in the corner and don't say a word.\nKeep those sausage fingers to yourself.\nYes, Your Majesty Princess of Nightmares!\nNow, Gene, step onto the password icon,\nand I'll feed you the passwords.\nOkay.\nOkay. 10-11-2002.\n10-11-2002.\nAccess denied.\nOkay, try a different expression.\nIs it gonna blast me every time I mess up?\nYeah, kinda.\nWhat do you mean, \"Kinda\"?\nReady?\nWelcome to the firewall.\nHis favorite food. Chimichangas.\nChimichangas?\nAccess denied.\nThis might take a while.\nBoy.\nKrav Maga.\nKrav Maga.\nMajor Lazer.\nMajor Lazer.\nAbuela Dora!\nSkate or die.\nAccess denied.\nDenied.\nI don't get it.\nWe've tried all the important things in Alex's life.\nHis favorite pet, sport, his favorite grandma.\nI'm sorry, Gene.\nI let us all down.\nYou know, if I had to come up with a password,\nI'd probably use the name of a girl I liked.\nI've been all over the phone.\nHe's never mentioned a girl.\nYes, he has.\nHi. When I was in the trash, I read a very interesting e-mail,\nbut I'm just the dunce in the corner, forbidden to speak.\nWhat e-mail?\nSorry, what?\nWhat e-mail?\nTo a girl at school.\nHe was declaring his feelings of love for her.\nI guess instead of sending it, he tossed it in the trash.\nHi-5, this is very important.\nWhat is her name?\nHer name, yes. Excellent question.\nIt was Tina.\nKaren.\nMarge. Lindsey.\nAlison.\nSarah or Lupita.\nI want to say Lupita,\nbut that doesn't feel right now I'm saying it out loud.\nJennifer.\nGot to find that e-mail.\nPhillipa.\nI think I can access the trash.\nAnnabelle.\n-I got it! Addie!\n-Yes!\nYes! That's it! Addie!\nI knew I'd get there.\n\"Dear Addie, you and I, we're like diamonds in the sky.\n\"You're a shooting star I see,\n\"a vision of ecstasy.\n\"Shine bright like a diamond.\"\nAnd he used a high five, see?\nI guess now we know why he trashed it.\nShade.\nGuys, should we try this?\nAddie.\nAccess granted.\nSnap.\nThis place is amazing.\nThe cloud.\nI can't believe it.\nOne little emoji could sure get lost in a place like this.\nI guess we should make you a Meh\nbefore that Bot comes back?\nSo, we're gonna... We're gonna do that now?\nWe had a deal.\nRight?\nYeah, okay. Right.\nI, guess I'll start hacking.\nWe did it, Gene.\nAll our dreams are coming true.\nI'll be an Alex favorite again, and you'll be a real Meh.\nYeah!\nYeah, but this all seems kind of super-fast now, though.\nDoesn't it?\nHi-5, I just didn't expect to be having these feelings right now.\nWell, maybe you should go and express them while you still can.\nSo, I've been... I mean, um...\nEver since we...\nJailbreak, you're the coolest, most interesting emoji I've ever met.\nAnd after all the adventures that we had,\nI'm just not sure I want all that to go away,\nbecause my feelings right now are, like, huge.\nI just think that they could be enough for me to want to stay the way I am.\nIf it means I could stay here with you.\nLike, forever.\nForever and ever and ever.\nMaybe longer than that even.\nLike in the fairy tales.\nLike, what is \"? Is that a good \"?\nGene, if this is about you deciding not to be meh,\nthen I am all about that.\nI like you just the way you are.\nBut I had a plan.\nRight.\nI'm not just some princess, Gene, waiting for my prince.\nI mean, what you said was beautiful, but...\nGene.\nYou're all meh.\nThe source code worked!\nTurns out I didn't need it.\nFor the first time in my life, meh is all I feel.\nNo! Gene!\nHi. I have an appointment. I'm a little early.\nNo problem. I can take you right now.\nJailbreak!\nDon't do that!\nThat freaky huge Bot has got Gene back inside the phone.\nWhat?\nHe left looking more meh than the meh-est meh face I've ever seen.\nWhat did you say to him?\nIt's what I didn't say.\nWe've got to go get him.\nHow are we gonna get in there in time before he gets deleted?\nI can't believe I'm doing this.\nYou tell anyone you saw this, and I'll crack more than those knuckles.\nBirds do love princesses!\nIt's not a myth.\nIt's not a myth at all!\nWhat happened to becoming a favorite?\nGuess I'd rather have one real friend.\nAnd let's go get him.\nI can't wait to see the look on Gene's face!\nLook at that expression.\nIs that for realizing you've put all of Textopolis at risk,\ncausing Alex to question our reliability?\nHey, that's going too far, even for me.\nIf we can delete this malfunction before his appointment,\nthey'll discover there's nothing wrong with the phone.\nAny last words?\nMeh.\nWell, it's too late for that.\nDelete him!\nWait.\nYou delete Gene, you'll have to delete me, too.\nI have the same malfunction Gene does.\nDad?\nGosh, I don't know what to do.\nYes, I do.\nBot!\nNo!\nSorry, Mrs. Meh.\nI did not see that one coming.\nSmiler, I think you might be making\ntoo much stink out of all this.\nReally? How about you're next?\nI was wrong, Gene.\nI should've believed in you all along.\nWhat a touching daddy-son reunion moment.\nIt reminds me of the time I deleted you both.\nWait. That's this time!\nDelete the two malfunctions!\nNo.\nHow's that for an...\nGreat.\nI can't reach!\nNo! What did you do to my beautiful...\nMy tooth.\nHand, button.\nJailbreak?\nGene.\nYou really are a Meh.\nWhat happened to looking out for number one?\nBeing number one doesn't matter\nif there aren't any other numbers.\nAlex's appointment!\nHe's deleting the phone!\nNo, no, no!\nShow me Alex.\nAre you sure you want to delete everything?\nDo it.\nRed alert! Red alert!\nAlex, no!\nGame over.\nFellas, I'm afraid this is last call.\nDude, Addie's here. You should go over.\nEvery time I try, I screw it up.\nI don't know how to tell her how I feel.\nIf we help Alex connect to Addie, maybe he won't delete us.\nI might be able to bypass the wipe and get a text through to him.\nBut we'll only have time to send one.\nMaybe I should go.\nHe has love in his eyes.\nSend me. Alex looks nervous, too.\nHe's more shy than nervous.\nStop!\nIt's Gene.\nHe's all of those things.\nAn emoji should only be one thing.\nReally?\nThe Princess!\nLinda!\nNot now, Mom!\nGene, you got this.\nThat's not me anymore.\nBut I have to try.\nIt's starting!\nNo, it's ending!\nI'm working on it.\nMom? Dad?\nNo.\nI'm in.\nLast time I was in this cube, I screwed everything up.\nGene, why do you think I came back?\nIt's because of you.\nMe?\nIt's all inside of you, Gene.\nJust try to bring it back.\nAnd do you.\nHi-5!\nI don't want to wave good-bye.\nIt's now or never, Gene.\nJailbreak, now!\nCheck out this emoji.\nNo way.\nHey, I got your text.\nThat's one super-cool emoji.\nI know, right?\nA lot of feelings in one. I get it.\nI like that you're one of those guys\nwho can actually express his feelings.\nYeah. That's me.\nSo, do you think you'd want to...\nYes.\nI'd love to go to the dance with you.\nHey, excuse me.\nWe made it!\nI could've lost you, Peter Pinkie.\nOr you, Reggie Ring Finger.\nEven you, Tiberius Thumb.\nChange your mind?\nYeah, maybe it's weird, but...\nI'm gonna hold on to it.\nGene, you did it!\nYou saved us all!\nMel.\nGene! Gene!\nGene! Gene! Gene!\nGene. Gene. Gene.\nGene! Gene! Gene! Gene!\nGene! Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene!\nThey love us! And Hi-5!\nAnd Hi-5! And Hi-5! And Hi-5!\nThey love both of us!\nHey, what up, Gene? Slap me some skin.\nAnd a little porridge for the pinkie.\nHey, Hi-5, save me a dance for later.\nAs long as you're not all hands again.\nBack on top of the hand pile.\nYou're not on the list.\n-Wait, what?\n-What's going on?\nFrom now on, everyone is welcome!\nWait, what is all this?\nIt's for you, Gene.\nEverybody, the Emoji Pop!\nThis is jazzy.\nYeah.\nGo, Eggplant! Go, Eggplant! Go, Eggplant!\nWe are out of Alex's pocket, emojis.\nThis is not a butt dial.\nTo your cubes.\n-Are we up and running?\n-Roger that.\nGood, 'cause we got incoming.

The fact that there are product placements isn't the issue, but the fact that they take up the majority of the movie and replace the story ruin it. Not a single joke gets a laugh, not a single actor tries at all, not a single story beat will change your perspective, the plot holes are numerous given the lack of plot, the animation is not spectacular, and no creativity is put into the world that could have been very inventive. The only plus to the film is the glimmers of social commentary about replacing activity with technology. However, a film about emojis was the wrong place for this. Overall, young kids will like it fine, but I think this is the worst animated film of all time (excluding Foodfight).",

Buyt the absolute highlight of the movie has got to be Sir Patrick Stewars as hthe Poop. That was the hottest miveu moment of a;ll time.\n\nTo be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The Emoji Movie. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Gene's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Shakespearen literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Emoji Movie truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Poop's existential catchphrase \"Haha! We are number two!\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tony Leondis' genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have an Emoji Movie tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

On the other hand, the animation is incredible and is ironically hilarious as there is no subtly about how dumb of an idea the movie really is and it shows with how hilarious the execution is.

I am not even kidding, the plot, if you can call it that is interrupted constantly for adverts for products such as Drop Box, Twitter, YouTube and even the Just Dance game.  I am not even joking, for no reason, the plot is interrupted for an advert for a mobile version of Just Dance.  Everyone in this movie is terrible, they are all giving awful performances, including smug performances from Anna Faris, T J Miller, especially James Corden, who seems to be in every terrible animated film I am watching at the minute, playing the exact same role every time and in this film, he is incredibly annoying.  The jokes are never funny, the animation is obnoxious and there is no real message to it whatsoever.  Kind of ironic considering it\u2019s a movie about emoji\u2019s.  This is one of the most cynical things I have ever seen aimed at children and the fact that this film is aimed at children is the most disgusting part of it.  The film also has no original idea whatsoever, ripping off other more successful family films constantly, especially Inside Out, Wreck it Ralph and Toy Story, doing it in a way that required no effort at all.  You will want to slap some dignity into Patrick Stewart for playing the pooper emoji and I would like to point out the opening credits say Sir Patrick Stewart, Robbie Collins summed it up better in saying the opening credits might as well have said \u201cyes, we have ruined this man\u2019s career\u201d.  Everything about it is everything I despise about cinema:  no effort, product based placement throughout the Wazoo, no originality, mugging actors constantly giving off the impression that they know what they are in is terrible but they don\u2019t care as they got an easy pay check and an attitude of \u201cthat\u2019s good enough for them\u201d, which cinema should never have!!  Before you say anything, the opposite is just as bad, I hate films that go \u201cif you don\u2019t get it you are obviously an idiot\u201d.  So don\u2019t accuse me of being elitist for my opinions on this film.  It\u2019s just crap and anything in the comments section for this review that have any emoji\u2019s in are getting deleted instantly.  I am sick of them now and if I ever see a copy of this film, I am going to set it on fire.  I HATED THIS MOVIE!!!",

            "content": "\"The Emoji Movie\" is maybe one of the most perplexing pieces of media I have ever borne witness to. I feel strange saying this, but this movie was written... incorrectly. I have never before felt this way about a film, but this movie was\"The Emoji Movie\" is maybe one of the most perplexing pieces of media I have ever borne witness to. I feel strange saying this, but this movie was written... incorrectly. I have never before felt this way about a film, but this movie was written wrong. The worst part isn't even the fact that the main characters are representations of things as characterless as a coat rack, it's the fact that the film doesn't know what it wants to be. This movie has a bizarre tendency of making overly cynical jokes, yet presenting them in such a way that children are guaranteed to take the wrong message. For example, the phrase \"Words are lame, use an emoji\" are presented at a certain point to the user of the phone where the eponymous emojis reside, yet this phrase is not balanced in any way by a differing perspective, a sarcastic glance, or any similar method of showing that it was a joke. This happens multiple times throughout the film. It is also worth noting that pretty much every line spoken by the \"Jailbreak\" character seems to be there just so they can consolidate the female gender into a marketing tactic like they did with \"Ghostbusters\". Thankfully, it doesn't work at all, and just makes a few scenes a lot more awkward than they would have been normally. I recall actually pausing the movie when she said the line \"You know men are always taking credit for things that women come up with\" after the main character figured out what her reasoning was and confirmed that he knew what she was talking about, not at all taking any credit for what she was saying.In terms of the rest of the movie, I feel bad for anyone who paid to sit through 2 hours of advertisements for dropbox. I almost didn't expect it to be as bad as it is. For a film which prominently shows spam emails as a recurring joke, it sure does present a lot of its own spam. Another pause moment happened when the main characters escaped from a villain by going into dropbox, to which the girl replied \"It's illegal malware, and this app is secure!\". I believe I could feel my brain slowly melting out of my ears when that statement was made.While I didn't enjoy this movie, it is kind of a shame that it had to be this way. A lot of people probably didn't like this movie solely because it was essentially a drawn-out advertisement for smartphone downloads. The problem is, there is another movie that is essentially one big advertisement for products, yet it's one of the best animated films I've ever seen! If the people making \"The Emoji Movie\" had taken any inspiration from \"The Lego Movie\", we could have had a potentially amazing film! It is especially depressing since the animation in this film is as good as it could be, being wonderfully stylized and moving beautifully. All in all, \"The Emoji Movie\" is maybe one of the most depressing pieces of cinema I've ever seen. In terms of recommendations, if you are a person who likes to tear films apart, I would recommend watching this film once and never again. To everyone else, avoid this film like the black plague. It's bad for you and terrible for your kids.",

Not even when it's just his voice trying to carry the show. The whole cast sounds so generic I was genuinely shocked to find out that it wasn't comprised solely of D-listers. What was Patrick Stewart thinking?!It starts off simple enough. A boring Wreck-It-Ralph rip-off that really has nothing going on. It's kind of smug in a \"haha, look at me! I'm poking fun at how teenagers keep their heads buried in their phones!\" sort of way. Self-satisfied with the fact that it even exists in the first place. It's bad, but not torture. Not then. But oh boy does it take a turn. It happens about the time Candy Crush shows up. That's right ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot of app-related product placement. Watching the little emojis play Candy Crush is just as fun as watching a real life person play Candy Crush. Not fun at all. But it doesn't stop there. We get to watch the little tumors play with other apps as well. Oh boy!It's got more than just phone games though. We'll witness these poor excuses for characters visit Dropbox, YouTube, Spotify, and a few others. Now, this could have been a cute thing, but the implementation isn't clever or inventive. Nothing in The Emoji Movie is. The stale quest about being true to who you are is not only devoid of originality, but heart as well. Every emoji and phone creature thingy is a bland stereotype meant to carry the almost non-existent plot forward. Things get weird when it tries to preach feminism and has weird symbolism on things like divorce. It never manages to actually say anything about them, but you can tell they're there. Because, you know, I'm sure that didn't go over the heads of the 6 year olds in the audience out there. The ones that were scarred for life by their first truly abysmal movie.What tiny bit of imagination it does have is only present on the surface level and is meant to cover up a rotten core created by a group of morally bankrupt individuals that created this film to exploit children in order to prey on the wallets of their unsuspecting parents who didn't know any better. The Emoji Movie is a humorless romp through cellphone land that is devoid of joy and personality. Don't watch it and certainly don't let it near your kids. That would be child abuse in my book. I'm sure there are judges who would agree.",

The Jokes Are So Mindless And So **** Stupid. It\u2019s Just LAZY! LAZY LAZY LAZY!!!!! There Is No Reason For This Movie To Exist. The Plot Is Just Stupid And Goes No Where. There Is Barely Any Time And Effort Put Into To It. NONE Of The Jokes Are **** Clever At All. It\u2019s Generic And Overall The Writing Is Just Terrible. The Film Ends With You Guessed? Yep. A **** Dance Sequence. The Idea That Drop Box Is An Important Plot Point In This **** Movie Is Stupid. The Mindless App References Were Tedious. It May Have Tried To Be Clever But It Failed MISERABLY!!!!Animation: Animation Is Garbage. It\u2019s Flashing And It\u2019s So **** Bright It Makes My Eyes Wanna Bleed. That\u2019s How **** Bad It Is. Trust Me It\u2019s That Painful.Overall Opinion: This Movie Is Utter Garbage And Just A Cheap Cash In At The Soul Sake Of Selling A God Damn Product. It\u2019s Boring And Lazy With Terrible Writing, Terrible Humor, Bad Acting, And Overall Is A Film That SHOULD NOT HAVE Existed.Grade: F.",

It's so bad that the film has been stuck in production limbo for a decade and it hasn't aged well. The CGI, the story and the one-liners (oh God, the one-liners...) all bear the mark of genuine and profound incompetence, a complete lack of even the most most rudimentary story-telling skills.What passes for a narrative revolves around supermarket brands coming to life at night.

The story, if you can call it that, is literally a shot for shot remake of Inside Out, just without any form of emotion thrown into it. And you know when you failed that aspect when the main stars of your feature are actual emotions, or Emojis in this case. The movie's sense of humor is just plain unfunny throughout the film, and the characters have already been done in other, better movies. The biggest example being Jailbreak. However, while the writing is abysmal, the animation is not. It's really colorful, how the animators design and animate the Emojis and the apps is pretty creative, the animation when in the human world is decent, and the effects of things being made out of little cubes like fire, debris, and the upgraded bots is a nice detail. So, all in all, the animation is not half bad. But then you realise it's not half good either. Some of the character designs look weird, like on Smiler, the textures of the emojis' hair looks honestly out of place, and again, some of the app designs have already been done in the past.

'The Emoji Movie'There are no words to describe how bad this movie is... in fact, there are no emojis to describe how bad this movie is... not even the \"poop\" emoji is insulting enough to this film, since he is one of the main characters... 'The Emoji Movie' is the worst movie of 2017 so far, a film so bad and so joyless, I gave it a \"Zero\" rating. A rating I very rarely give, unless it's to 'The Room' (2003) or any of \"The Human Centipede\" films. This film has joined that club. The film (if I can even call it that) follows an emoji named Gene (voiced by T.J. Miller), who lives in Textopolis, a world found inside of a smart phone. Gene is the son of Mel Meh (Steven Wright) and Mary Meh (Jennifer Coolidge). Gene feels that he can be useful when he gets work, but when given the opportunity, when the phone owner sends texts using emojis, and Gene is selected, he is often unsure of what to do, and tries to what he can at the last minute. This ends up wrecking the text centre, and Gene feels responsible. We meet a handful of other characters from; Smiley (Sean Hayes) to Hi-5 (James Corden), and more depressingly so, the legendary Sir Patrick Stewart voices the Poop emoji. Good to see that he has moved up in his career, especially since he co-starred in the excellent 'Logan' (2017). There is so much to talk about with this so-called \"movie\", but honestly, this is awful. Why even talk about it when nobody, in their right mind, would see it either alone, or with their families. There are five top reasons as to why this film is the worst of 2017... 1) Bad writing, 2) Horrible animation, 3) Lack of storytelling, 4) No compelling characters and 5) Bad pacing. The movie's pace is so uneven, I found that it dragged towards the third act. How could so many talented actors from T.J. Miller (who was hilarious in 'Deadpool) to Sir Patrick Stewart get involved in this trainwreck? It tries to be like 'Inside Out' (2015) in regards to the premise (emotional characters inside a tiny world)... but I had a headache watching this turd, and I'm sure nobody else will see it too. Let's hope this movie does not influence more like this in the future. One \"Emoji Movie\" is bad enough.",
