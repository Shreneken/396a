            "content": "I admit, 'Ayla: The Daughter of War' is not entirely what I expected. Part of me expected a war movie in the veins of 'Warsaw 44'. However, 'Ayla' is far more emotional, and not so much about war, but rather about humanitarian response to war situations. In this regard, it was truly exceptional.If the little girl doesn't steal your heart, nothing will. If Suleyman doesn't win you over as a caring individual and father figure, chances are nothing will. Ismail Hacioglu was fantastic as Suleyman, a character I really cared about and rooted for. 'Ayla' is a beautiful, touching and heart wrenching story. The film revolves around Turkish soldiers being sent to Korea, who encounter a young girl - as the only survivor - during one of their field missions. What follows next is a beautiful story among the horrors of war.Based on fact, this is an incredibly inspirational story. The film reminded me - to a certain extent - of the Chinese film 'Aftershock' and the Korean film 'Ode to my Father' - both exceptional films in its own right.'Ayla' is by far one of the most endearing war films you will ever see. Despite the dramatic element, the film also delivers some very effective comedic moments. 'Ayla' is a one of a kind war film, but might not satisfy everyone's taste in a war movie.",

The movie is so emotional that me, I consider myself as a non-emotional person, even I wasn't able to hold myself to not to cry. Being based on a true story makes it even better on my opinion. You can hold yourself to not to cry on the whole movie but just wait for the credits. When you watch the movie you'll understand what I'm talking about right now.

            "content": "Firstly, \"Oscar nominee of Turkey\" was a tag to attract Turkish audience. And i think it worked.Turkish soldiers who went on a mission for the Korean war were dramatic piece of history. None of us give enough credit for those spared for securing Turkey's position in modern Western World and NATO. But we know these soldiers proved both fearless and humanitarian during their duty. Was it a wise choice to send them and how it resulted? Here is not the place to answer. But we can say this movie was quite numb to the politics of 1950s and took just what it needed from those days.Based on a real story that we heard on TV before, scenario was the strong point of the movie. But instead of giving it the depth and character development it deserved, script plunged into silly sentimentality at all. Ismail Hacioglu, Ali Atay and even Cetin Tekindor failed to deliver something special from their selves. To make things worse like TV series seen on TRT TV like \"Dirili\u015f: Ertugrul\" there were absurd and unrealistic fight scenes, Turkish Airlines and Hyundai ads. There was an irrelevant jump to the 1999 earthquake and scenario felt disconnected.Cinematography was not bad, there were beautiful shots and high quality. The real footage at the end was charming.Overall; another extravagant and shallow Turkish blockbuster film made a lot of fuss but nothing gained.",

They are proved people with talent for acting! 2) The story is based on a real one. 3) This movie combines all possible parts of peoples and especially the Turkish people and shows, that nation, humanity and love is above everything else! You can see Turkish communists, nationalists, humanists, Muslims, Atat\u00fcrk, Americans, Koreans, the UN, different cultures and so on all living side by side. 4) Great special effects, great equipment is used.Just go and watch it!

Frantic, scared and on the verge of death, this little girl captures the heart of S\u00fcleyman, who risks his own life to save her, smuggling her into his Army base and out of harms way. Not knowing her name and unable to communicate with her, S\u00fcleyman names her Ayla, in reminiscence of the moon on the fateful night during which they met. The two form an instantaneous and inseparable bond, and Ayla, almost effortlessly, brings an uncanny joy to the Turkish brigade in the grip of war. As the war comes to a close however, S\u00fcleyman's brigade is told that they will be returning home. S\u00fcleyman cannot bear abandoning Ayla, and does everything within his power to take her with him. After repeated failure, he is forced to give Ayla to an orphanage, but doesn't give up on the hope of one day reuniting with her. Will the two ever get back together?",

I thought the subject is interesting and it would be successful especially for Turkish viewers. However at the end I had mixed feelings about it. It was quite emotional, for a father to watch. There were quite funny parts as well. However, I think it was a mistake to use the identities of the original people in the movie as it probably portrayed characters quite differently. S\u00fcleyman in the movie was down right obsessive and too irrational when it comes to leave her in Korea. Behavior of his actual daughter against him later in the movie was also unusual. From what I know, actual events did not unfold that way. Actual events were emotional and dramatic enough, why put unnecessary agitation?During the war, Turkish soldiers were known as fierce fighters and not to retreat without a good fight. Indeed during the battle of Wawon (Kunuri) they fight against overwhelming Chinese troops for their life. When their ammunition depleted they fought with knives rocks and fists. In the movie they try to insert this with little success IMO. Perhaps portraying actual events more realistically would be much better (watch Tae Guk Ki for the contrast in battle parts). I think with more side stories and less deliberate emotional push, this movie could be very good. I would give a 6, but for the effort, it deserves a 7.",

The motivations of the characters are not told to us correctly. I think the emotions of the characters in a good war movie is so important. But in this movie , characters inside are too empty. They say nothing about war.At the same time, movie uses unnecessary scenes to make audience cry.The second half of the movie is completely different than first half.\u0130ts like watching two different movie.There is a big problem about time jumps.The older part of the main character is longer than necessary.In addition, the film contains propaganda than necessary. Also in movie war has not been shown to be painful on both sides. So the war in the film is not neutral and realistic.But on the other side Ayla has great acting. Every actors and actresses perform flawless.Production is beautiful. War scenes are exaggerated, but pleasant and realistic.As a result Ayla is an average movie.Not bad,but not that good.",

So for this one, I'm calling it the way I see it, it's dreadful, overly emotional fluff with poor directing and acting that's common in Turkish movies but is probably perceived as a bit premodern elsewhere.

            "content": "I watched the movie \"Ayla: The Daughter Of War\" in my school years on the recommendation of my classmate. The film is based on real events, and this fact immediately hooked me, since such films have always caused me only positive emotions. It can be seen that everything in the film is as idealized as possible, and the emphasis is only on the relationships of the main characters, but still it's worth watching the film to remember once again that you need to believe in goodness and love, and even more to believe that there are men in our world who are ready to live for the sake of children and give them their love.The film itself tells how in 1950 the main character Suleiman, along with Turkish troops, was sent to Korea to participate in the Korean War. And while on patrol, he finds a little girl whose whole family died. The girl didn't say anything, so the soldiers started calling her Ayla. Knowing nothing about the upbringing of children, Suleiman, however, is completely immersed in taking care of Ayla and, naturally, this leads to the fact that he becomes attached to her as a daughter. Of course, one could say - there was no need to get attached, but they pulled the child out of the horror of the war. Therefore, Suleiman and his wife are heroes in my eyes, because all these years they have not given up and fought to find Ayla, their named daughter.If we talk about the acting master class, then I would like to single out the girl - the main character. At first glance, there is a feeling that the child is somewhat sedentary, insensitive and just does what her told. But when you look into her eyes, you feel unselfish love, warmth, peace, wisdom in them, and they have such sincerity and life that is ready to calm an adult and make them believe in the best, even though the fact is that tanks and machine guns are rumbling behind their backs.If we talk about the work of the director and cameraman, there are no bloody scenes in the film, or scenes with elements of violence, nor do they show excerpts of how someone was torn apart by explosions, of course there are scenes with murder, but they are shown casually and not in close-up, it would be impossible to do without them, everything-still a film about the war and the events that took place during that wartime. The scenery in the film is military-field, which can be dug up wherever there is land, so almost the entire film only shows slums, poverty, devastation, land.Summing up, we can say that it turned out to be a really correct and very strong film, which I advise you to watch unequivocally and without any doubt.",

They showed everything different than it was.\nI lost my grandfather in that war, it's disrespectful to those people who forced to go there and gave up on their lives.The best thing was only seeing the real actors of this story, and the rest was a complete mess.\nAli Atay's character and acting was too bad I was shocked, because I'm a huge fan of his most famous TV series. He was acting like Mecnun, as he usually does in every project he is in, and it doesn't make him a great actor.\nThe other actors were also not well chosen.The story made us cry, not the movie.

The story is about a little Korean girl and a Turkish soldier back in the 1950's. It will definitely touch your heart. It is said that the film is going to nominated for the Oscars; I have no doubt that it deserves an Oscar :)",

            "content": "I was super hyped since the releasing of the first trailer. And I do not regret watching this masterpiece - but there are a few tiny little things that bothered me.Attention spoiler! We get to see the story of S\u00fcleyman and Ayla. The dosage of S\u00fcleymans story was perfect - not too much, not too less. But what I missed was Aylas life after the war. How she adopts to her life without S\u00fcleyman. We hear that her husband dies and and that she works as a cleaner but I wanted to see the little Ayla missing her father S\u00fcleyman but not giving up on her life. The second thing was the war. Yes it is a story of Ayla and S\u00fcleyman but personally I wanted to see more details of the war, the soldiers, their psychological status and maybe more war scenes. There were a few - but apparently not enough for me. Although I missed some little things I've enjoyed every second of this movie. The actors were great. Every scene they played I felt with them. The soundtrack, the editing and the effects were literally on point. I would watch Ayla again and again and won't be bored with it.(If I have any misspellings I'm sorry ignore them :) )",
