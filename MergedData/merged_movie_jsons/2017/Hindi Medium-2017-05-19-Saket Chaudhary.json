            "content": "Hindi Medium is an enjoyable and realistic tale which lands a tight slap on the face of a society which considers English as a parameter for judging people, where people are not taken seriously if they don't speak English well and they are made to feel inferior. The dialogues are hilarious and keep you entertained throughout. The plot gets a bit predictable towards the end and the film glorifies government schools, which are looked down upon in our society. A little preachy and over-dramatic towards the end, Hindi Medium strongly drives its point home.My Rating : 3.5/5",

This movie is one of those rare and brave attempts that try to explain the social situation rising above melodramas and unnecessary actions. The pure innocence of the story makes you feel it thanks to the brilliant acts by the Superstar Irrfan Khan, Award winning actor Deepak Dobriyal, and the very cool Amrita Singh. We have seen Saba Qamar in Pakistani dramas and we know what an amazing actress she is. She keeps the magic going here too. Hats off to Saket Chaudhary for weaving this movie beautifully.",

            "content": "There comes a movie once in a while which is not only thought- provoking but also sends out a great social message. \"Hindi Medium\" is definitely one of it. \"Hindi Medium\" tells the story of a married couple who does every thing under the sun to get their daughter admitted to the most popular school of Delhi. Saket Chaudhary, who gave us some memorable films like \"Pyaar Ka Side Effects\" and \"Shaadi Ke Side Effects\", goes one step further and create a satire on the education system which is very much prevalent in India. The film focuses on Indian parents' obsession who wants to send their kids to the high-profile schools despite exorbitant fees to learn English that will help them to be accepted in the society and land a job in MNC. A dialogue from Irrfan Khan \"If French and German speaks incorrect English, it is still fine but when an Indian does not speak proper English, then that person holds no value in the society. The movie is a laugh-riot and few scenes will definitely bring down the house. The scene at the factory where Irrfan wants to go for a bio-break gets interrupted by his boss is hilarious. Another scene at the Government school where a son of a Tourist guide displays his skills by speaking English, German and even French languages proving that talent has no boundary. Hats off to Saket Chaudhary for bringing something new on the Indian silver screen.The film does have it share of flaws as well. The second half becomes a little drag towards the end and climax becomes little melodramatic. Also, the editing should have been better trimming the film by another 10-12 mins. Art direction and Cinematography is simple which is the essence of story line with an average background score. The screenplay is good but loses somewhere later in the film. The film belongs to Irrfan Khan who carries it on his shoulder. The epitome of talent, Irrfan surprises you with subtle humor which will tickle your funny bone. Watch for him as he has tries to play \"good\" husband\" with perfection. The character played by Saba Qamar will remind you of Sridevi from 1997's blockbuster \"Judaai\" who is lured by elite society of Delhi. Deepak Dobriyal is mindblowing. The actor just adds spark to the film every time he appears on-screen. Amrita Singh does about okay.Overall, \"Hindi Medium\" is electrifying that boast of lot of humor and laugh to keep you entertained. Good 3/5",

In other words, it is not just names that are being used to sell movies. Hindi Medium takes us through the troubles of a couple to get their child into the top 5 elementary schools of New Delhi. While some of the scenes and situations are over-the-top they are intentionally done that way so as to be satirical. However, they are all relatable since each one of us has went through these troubles ourselves or know someone who did. Irfan Khan and his dialogues are hilarious as always. The newcomer, Saba Qamar, also does a decent job. A highly recommended watch for everyone except fighting couples who are debating about which school to put their child in to.",

            "content": "Hindi Medium, a satire on our education system by Saket Chaudhary, is a very relevant film. This is his third film after Pyaar ke Side Effects and Shaadi ke Side Effect. It seems that humour is his forte. In Hindi Medium, he takes a dig at our current Education System. These days education has become a business. Children's education has become costlier than many of the professional or vocational courses in our country. Schools have the trend of charging exorbitant fees in lieu of tuition fee, capitation fee, donation, extra-curricular activities' fund etc. 'The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act' or 'Right to Education Act (RTE)' was enforced on 1st April, 2010. When this act came into force, India became one of 135 countries to make education a fundamental right to every child between the ages of 6 and 14. This act does require all private schools to reserve 25% of seats for the children from families of low economical status. But what actually happens with this quota is still under question. This act has many other relevant clauses too in favour of students. It also makes provisions for no donation or capitation fees and no interview of the child or parent for admission. Saket has come up with a brilliant film on this. The film showcases the stress of parents in getting their children admitted into elite schools, and their efforts to manipulate things to get the admission, school management falling prey to bribe, the admission scam, the conditions of the government schools etc. This fact can not be ignored that many of the government schools in our country are underperforming due to lack of facilities, infrastructure support and resources. There is a clear cut demarcation between the English Medium Schools and Hindi Medium Schools. And also, there is a special affinity for English Language in our country i.e. whoever speaks English are supposed to have a 'class'. A person might be very good in his / her mother tongue or Hindi, but being affluent in English only makes that person sophisticated. There is Social Divide between English speaking and Hindi speaking people. This is a mindset, which one needs to ponder upon. Saket certainly is successful in throwing light upon all these issues in a very light-hearted manner.The film begins with a girl - young Mita - coming to a tailor's shop to get a designer dress stitched and young Raj (Delzad Hiwale, Chittagong & Chauranga fame) assures the girl that her dress will be stitched exactly similar to the design she wanted. There starts the love story of Raj and Mita in the backdrop of a beautiful song 'Lafzon ke haseen dhagoon me kahin piro raha hum main huzur\u0085' After a period of fifteen years, we get to see that Raj Batra (Irrfan Khan) has grown into 'the Business Tycoon' of Chandani Chowk (Delhi) with a fashion studio. He understands the pulse of the customers. His wife Mita (Saba Qamar) does speak English well whereas Raj doesn't. Raj calls her Mitthu fondly. She is very particular that their daughter Piya (Dishita Sehgal) studies in any one of the top five English Medium Schools of Delhi. They do apply in top five schools. And for this they do shift their base from Chandni Chowk to the posh colony of Vasant Vihar, undergo specialized training for attending interviews, handling questions and speaking English. But unable to find admission through General Quota, when Raj comes to know regarding 25% quota for the students from poor families, he decides to go to slum area along with Mita and Piya so as to clear the inspection. That is where they get good Samaritan neighbours Shyam Prakash (Deepak Dobriyal) and wife Tulsi (Swati Das). What happens thereafter is to be seen. Although there is a drag in certain areas in the second half with certain scenes of the slum, but consistent humour in the screenplay keeps the mood of the film very bright. Also, certain issues raised in the film do not see a closure. The highlight of the film is effortless acting by Irrfan Khan. He is an actor to reckon with. He blends with every character he plays on screen and he adds lot of value to the same. Even after one leaves the theater, his acting remains in heart and mind. Saba Qamar, originally a Pakistani Actress, is also very good, natural and convincing as Mita. Deepak Dobriyal as Shyam Prakash gives a wonderful performance. His expressions are very impressive. Tillotama Shome as career counsellor is very good. Swati Das as Tulsi is also very much noticeable. Rest of the characters Dishita Sehgal, Amrita Singh (as Head Mistress of a School), Sanjay Suri and Neha Dhupia are all good.There are lot of scenes with which one could relate to \u2013 be it the parental pressure of getting their children's admissions in good schools, the struggle of the middle class or lower class to be able to provide good education to their children, the social divide etc. There is a scene where Tillotama conveys a dialogue \u2013 \"People book me when they are in their first trimester.\" Unfortunately, this is a Reality too.Hindi Medium, a satire on our education system, is a very relevant film. It showcases various issues viz. Social Divide between English and Hindi speaking people, the demarcation between government schools and private schools facilities, the school admission scams etc. in a very light-hearted manner. Irrfan Khan, Saba Qaram and Deepak Dobriyal shine in the film through their effortless acting.",

            "content": "Hindi medium is about a businessman and his wife who want their daughter to get admission in the best school of the city. Both of them think that if their daughter goes to a normal government school like they did when they were kids, she will not receive the proper education and most importantly, won't be able to match up with the 'English speaking' children of her age.So they decided that they will do anything to make sure she gets admission in one of the best schools of Delhi. The movie captures the journey of two parents as they move from a high-class society to give their child exposure to a small 1- room apartment in a disease prone area to register for admission as a child of a poor family. It may be too late for the reality to descend on them that these actions of theirs are affecting a lot of other people too.The movie explores the desperation of parents as they go to great lengths to give the best education to their children. Also, it tells us how big institutions can tweak the admission process. In the end, it leaves you with many questions. Is it really worth it? Making your child study in a school where she may never be able to fit? Should English be the only thing distinguishing between who gets admission and who doesn't? Even after focusing this heavy subject, the movie is light. The facts are presented with jokes to make it watchable and even entertaining for the audience. Sometimes, it feels like the film is missing point and extending some not-so-important sequences. This slowed the pace for a while but it picked it up again in the end. Irfan Khan brought his best to the character of a Chandni Chowk Saree salesman who is a concerned father and a loving devoted husband who will do anything for best education of his child, or, as his wife always warns him, keep their child away from drugs as she grows old. Saba Qamar did a fine job but still has a long way to go. The duo posed as a nice on screen couple. Deepak Dobriyal, who portrayed a helping natured hard working factory worker, was fantastic as always. He sure has gathered many accolades for his recent ventures and this film will also add some more. Director Saket Chaudhary, known for directing \"Pyaar ke side effect\", did okay. Music was one plus point, with some gracefully placed new songs accompanied by remixes of some well-known songs. In summary, I would say the movie is definitely worth a watch. So, what it is not a great one, but it sure will give you a lot to think about. In that process, you may talk about it a lot and will also suggest it to others, as I am doing now.",

The best thing about this movie is that it perfectly delivers this important message without lacking anywhere in the entertainment front (filled with humor and brilliant acting). I am sure you will fall in love with this Raj & Mitthu (sorry \"Honey\") pair instantly. Irfan as the obedient and madly in love with his wife kind of husband and Saba Qamar as a demanding and dominating wife is such a fun to watch. This movie will revive your faith in Indian Cinema which has been damaged by many Indian Superstars who cash on their loyal fan followings for grand box office collection with nothing to offer in return (a descent and original piece of work is what we expect).\"Talent speaks the language of a genius, surprisingly it's not the languages we all speak.\"",

            "review_title": "A charming film despite the shortcomings",
            "content": "A charming and enjoyable film, indeed. The film, a comedy about a couple who will go to any extent to have their daughter enrolled in the best English school in Delhi, starts with no direction and takes far too long to pick up. However, when it does, it is surprising in how traditional it is in terms of its abundant emotional quotient. From then on, it often resorts to sentimentality, but its heart is in the right place. The second half takes an interesting twist where the couple adopt a poor lifestyle in order to qualify for registration from the back door. This part of the film really strains credulity, but interestingly enough, it is the beginning of the best and most engaging part in the film.The film is a nice commentary on the education system in India, on social classes, on poverty. The most striking quote from the film is said by Deepak Dobriyal: \"Living in poverty is an art\", namely, it needs to be experienced over the course of generations to be understood and dealt with. This, of course, sounds quite harrowing, but the poor neighbourhood is very well portrayed. Actually, the general feel is so humorous and light that many pitfalls can be forgiven. Towards the end, it grows even more sentimental and the final sequences, particularly the main lead's speech at the end of the show, are done in true Hindi film style of yore - very stagy and a little manipulative.Hindi Medium works, it's fun and often quite touching. Even if some parts do not ring true, everything is within the film's wholesome context, and above all, it caters to certain sensibilities which foreigners wouldn't grasp. What really elevates it to another level is doubtlessly Irrfan Khan, whose effortless charisma is the film's trump card. He is a real man and a star, and he is funny and convincing in his renowned minimalism. Saba Qamar is wonderful and grows on you throughout the story. Amrita Singh is excellent; her part is more of a caricature, but she can do hardly wrong. It is obviously Deepak Dobriyal who delivers the film's most moving performance. A charming film with a nice morale it is.",

            "content": "First Published On- https://myunwantedreviews.wordpress.com/2017/05/22/hindi-medium-a- subject-in-which-we-should-score-an-a/My mother is a government school teacher. Once in a while, I drop her to her school. The other day I asked her, why do you think the number of kids going to government schools is constantly on a decline? Is the quality of education in government schools so bad? She said, it's not about dropping of education level, but about the parents' wish to send their kids to government schools, or any Hindi Medium school for that matter. They believe that government schools are not capable enough to prepare their kids for the real world.Hindi Medium runs around same premises but it's not limited to that. It is a satire presented in most comic and simplest way possible. This is not just about a couple's struggle to get their child admitted to the school, but about the complete series of events, good or bad, they have to go through. Rampant corruption they have to face and voluntarily or involuntarily become a part of it.This movie is about our obsession with the English language. Because talking in English in India does not just signifies the knowledge of a different language but, unfortunately, also a division of class from the mass. Hindi Medium is a social commentary on the elitist mentality of our society, where we evolved from the caste divide but get into the trap of class divide. A class where having money is not enough, where speaking Hindi is looked down upon, and where kitty parties are held on the basis of your kid's school.The first half of the movie is kind of a situational comedy and considerably more interesting than the second one which feels like drowning in its own goodness. But it has the entry of immensely talented Deepak Dobriyal, who is sharing the screen with Irrfan after fourteen years since Maqbool. His portrayal of 'Shuddh Garib' Shyam is mind blowing. His effortless display of comedy, emotions, and pain in a shorter screen time makes him an excellent actor.Irrfan Khan. Is there anything this man can't do? He is undoubtedly one of the most versatile actors present in Indian Cinema. His comic timing, dialogue delivery, screen presence, everything is a class apart. He puts his heart and soul into the character of Raj Batra, a responsible father, and a good husband.Saba Qamar as Mita has done a really good job. Her portrayal of the character was very controlled. She has to look rich, feel rich, and act rich but at the same time doesn't have to look arrogant. She maintained an aura of a down to earth rich Vasant Vihar lady who is constantly trying to adjust in her new 'posh' locality.There is one more acting credit which deserves to be given is of Tillotama Shome, who, by her brilliant acting make her powerful presence felt. She put life in a character which Indian audience generally fails to notice otherwise.I would not say the movie has a brilliant screenplay but it definitely has some genuinely funny dialogues, which assure some hearty laughs in regular intervals. Even small characters have been given enough chance to make the audience laugh. Music composed by Sachin-Jigar is good, so is the background score by Amar Mohile. As for Saket Chaudhary, this one is his best movie after his previous two 'side effects' and is the one he will be remembered for in a long time.So if not for direction, screenplay or music, this movie is a must watch for its superb performances by the lead as well as the supporting cast.Hindi Medium is a garland woven with uneven beads but it looks and feels beautiful. It is an attempt, not so hard hitting though, but every bit worthy of praise for its genuine and simple nature. It is deserved to be watched by one and all.At the end of it, the movie seems too good to be true, and a little too preachy at the end. But it talks about a subject in which we all need to score an A+.",

It is more of a status symbol than a language.We live in a society where u will be mocked if you are not good in English.The message here is conveyed in a humorous way.

The Best thing in 'Hindi Medium' is the performance of DEEPAK DOBRIYAL. He is PERFECT.I cant even imagine anyone in that role.As a generous poor man, this performance of him was the best supporting performance of 2017. Rest of the cast in supporting role performed ably. The screenplay is very good & the direction by Saket Chaudhary is good.This attempt of Saket is better than his earlier work 'Shaadi ke side effects'.What's Bad-Some scenes involving humour or emotions don't work .But the overall impact of film is very good.

This recent sleeper-hit, is a worthy watch!'Hindi Medium' Synopsis: A couple from Chandni Chowk aspire to give their daughter the best education and thus try be a part of and accepted by the elite of Delhi.'Hindi Medium' is about the struggle of parents who go to extreme lengths to get their daughter the best in education. Zeenat Lakhani & Saket Chaudhary's Screenplay intelligently treats a serious social-message, with genuinely funny humor. Its amusing to watch the leading-pair do what they have to do get their kid in the right school & the tone is light-hearted all through. The first-hour, in particularly, is joyous. The second-hour does get a little flabby, but the climax packs a punch. Saket Chaudhary's Direction is noteworthy. Cinematography & Editing are credible. Performance-Wise: Irrfan Khan empowers 'Hindi Medium' with a winning performance. The versatile actor is simply superb & flaunts his gift in comic-timing. Saba Qamar is natural & very affecting. Deepak Dobriyal is excellent, as always. Tillotama Shome is outstanding. Amrita Singh leaves a mark. Sanjay Suri & Neha Dhupia are wasted in cameos.On the whole, 'Hindi Medium' is a good watch.",

The story is basically work done by certain parents in getting admission for their daughter in one of the top school in Delhi. These parents really want their daughter in one of the top schools, for which they are ready to go to any lengths. All that they do are shown the movie.One of the things that they do is move to poor neighborhood. There they find out a poor family who help them out. It showed how great are the heart of poor people. It reminded me of a poor family that helped me and my family, get through the storm when we stayed at Kasara in Maharashtra, just highlighting how big they are when it comes to being human.The only drawback movie has is it does not seem that realistic that the parents would go to such length. To add further, I am still confused why Irrfans family was asked for extra fees before admission and not the poor man's family who helped him. If you get that please let me know.",

            "content": "Hindi Medium is a film directed by Saket Chaudhary. Knowing what Saket has directed previously I had no hopes for the film. But as I saw the trailers for this film, I thought that this a was going to be a great film. And man, it was a great movie.Plot: Raj and Mita struggle to get admission for their daughter into a good school.Story and Direction: The story is very real and mostly simplistic. No gimmicks, high-fi songs, etc... It can be termed as a slice of life kind of film. The scenario of the high society, middle class and lower class is very clearly shown in this film. You can feel for the characters in each and every scene. The film never bores you. The length of the film is also perfect. The only fault with the film I can say is the cinematic liberties that it took. Some of the scenes felt that 'Is this possible??'. Other than that , I can't fault the film in any way.Acting: Irrfan has again proved as to why he is what he is. His comic timing is impeccable. Saba Qamar was also good as the concerned mother. Deepak Dobriyal was great as the poor man. He also got many laughs in me. Amrita Singh was also good. Sanjay Suri and Neha Dhupia in cameos were also good.Favorite Scene: It would obviously be the scene where Shyam Prasad hits the mosquito and shows it to Raj and Mita. That scene was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing in that scene.Music: Sachin-Jigar put together a very nice soundtrack. It doesn't actually add to the run-time of the film, that songs mostly do. I had no problem with the remixed Punjabi tracks since it didn't add to the run-time ('O Ho' was played during a dance number and 'Suit' is played in the end credits). 'Hoor' I would say was my favorite track of the film.Verdict: This again goes to prove that you don't need a lavish budget and songs to make a good movie. A good story with the right cast and crew can also do that. This film is easily one of my favorites that have come out this year.I am giving it a 9/10.",

            "content": "The apparent difference in outlook in spirituality between the Western and Eastern philosophy is quite visible. The former revolves around its fixation on following preset rules to appease the Maker. In the case of the latter, it appears to be more like an eternal quest. It is a lifelong journey to hunt for the secrets of the Universe. The whole teachings in the Vedanta, Buddhism, Confucianism and the Tao scriptures are towards this end.In simple terms, Eastern cultures are seekers of knowledge. Sometimes, this also became their own undoing. When the Western cultures first hit the Indian shores, the natives slowly neglected their age-old wisdom. They plunged head-long into their newfound obsession of acquiring erudition from the visitors, only to be led astray.This hunger for knowledge has not been quenched after all these years. The world over, Asians, armed with their right discipline and dedication, are slowly but surely making their presence felt once again. In academic, artistic and scientific fields, they are redeeming their rightful places.The movie, 'Hindi Medium' and its spiritual successor, 'Angrezi Medium' (English Medium) are evidence of the length Indian parents would go to ensure that their offspring will get a sound education.In 'Hindi Medium', a nouveau riche couple move into posh housing estate to register their young daughter in a prestigious grammar school. When the daughter failed to make it into the school register, the parents realise that they could still qualify under the quota set aside for the underprivileged students. They move into the most impoverished side of the town masquerading as the urban poor. The unpleasant living conditions, the dodging from the school inspector and the overprotective nature of their neighbours form the basis of this comedic, yet thought-provoking presentation.'Angrezi Medium' (2020) is Irrfan Khan's swansong. Here, he is a single parent of a bright teenage girl. Not wanting to repeat the same mistake of clipping his deceased wife's desire to study, he yearns for his daughter to win the scholarship to study in the UK. Khan also has a nagging legal battle with his family members over his small-time Indian sweets business. The court case goes against his favour. His bad luck, the presiding judge happened to be the husband of the principal of his daughter's school. The daughter's scholarship gets cancelled when Khan verbally abused the judge in a school function. The rest of the story is how Khan, against all the odds, although some of them are unbelievable, still manages to get his daughter enrolled in a university in the UK.",

The messages, the social lessons have been delivered beautifully through various little subplots. The subtlety worked wonders here. Though The writing and screenplay dips oftentimes but The performances from the ensembled cast help us to engage throughout the runtime. Irrfan Khan was superb as always, Saba Qamar; she was good too. Deepak Dobriyal another noteworthy performance just like the usual expectency from him. Some characters are short lived, although the director could have easily used them more. Especially talking about Amrita Singh. She should have gotten much more screen Presence as she as a veteran actress deserves so!The characterizations are not bad but the in between chemistry between those same characters felt unfulfilled. The building up wasn't really satisfying. And I blame Ameturish writing for that. The screenplay left many loose ends too.In the end It's a one time watch, that wanted to say more but couldn't. The messages it portray is still worthy of your time nonetheless. An Honest recommendation.",

But there is one big problem. Their zubaan is Hindi, and the elitist snobs won't let the Hindi speaking hoi-polloi fit in.At the core, the film deals with a very relevant subject of how language divides our society. How Angrezi-speaking people in India are touted to be 'premium class,' while the Hindi-waale\u00b8 however illustrious or wealthy, are low-brow, or plain uncool. Hindi Medium shines in two areas that most of our films often fall short of. As far as the story goes - good writing, and as far as comedy goes - great timing.Raj Batra (Irrfan) has a flourishing clothes store in Chandni Chowk, where he sells 'original copies' of acclaimed designers, while his wife Mithu (Saba) -- her name classily upgrades to Honey -- is struggling to angrezify their lifestyle so that their daughter Pia Batra (Dishita Sehgal) gets enrolled in a high-flying English medium school. They do everything they can -- move out of their ancestral home into a plush neighbour-hood, abandon their desi swag for designer wear and switch from bhangra to angrezi beats. Alas, it doesn't cut it. Plan B. Apply in the gareeb quota, move into a poor settlement with rags and rodents, and take gareebi ki training. Here, the couple meets Shyam Prakash (Deepak Dobriyal), who ironically, teaches them a few lessons - none that need language to comprehend.Saket haudhary gets the grammar of the subject right, and spells out the emotions fluently. The dialogues (Amitosh Nagpal) are perfectly pitched and interestingly, the humour rests on the hinge, never distracting from the centrepiece. Of course, Irrfan nails it with a class act, playing a man torn between his simple, unpretentious upbringing and his new wannabe avatar. Saba Qamar, as the OTT, dominating wife is sheer delight onscreen. Deepak Dobriyal is superb and in some scenes, he leaves you teary-eyed. The second half gets over-dramatic and the plot seems quite convenient, taking ample liberties. The last chapter (climax) is stretched and predictable, but in the end, it drives home the point, exposing the inadequacies and loopholes in our education system.This class isn't part of the usual Bollywood curriculum, and we suggest that you sign up for it. Admissions open to all.",

That way it will also give the movie much more viewers. Now a days people love watching movies as a stress reliever , so they look for a movie which is kind hearted, fun, romance and Hindi Medium fits the bill.We all know the current education system is all about money and quality rather than education. I live in Kerala so i don't know whether some scenes portrayed in the movie about taking admissions in high level school's is true or not (it happens in Kerala but i don't think its anywhere nearer to it). But if its true then the country is spoiled big time . There is a scene where irfan khan says other countries are fine with wrong vocabulary of English and if we Indians make one single error, then he/she doesn't have a value in the society. This is so true in the current society and it has been portrayed so beautifully. i could go on about the story and scenes but its better you enjoy it yourself rather than hearing it from a stranger.we all know irfan khan is an absolutely stunning actor, here he is the uneducated Indian and that especially create a lot of funny scenes, the role of the father is safe as it can get in the hands of irfan. he is the heartbeat of the movie. saba qamar as a mother craves for quality has been portrayed so brilliantly,we can relate her to our so called \"english loving neighbours\". irfan- saba combinations scenes are also feels very real. Deepak Dobriyal as Shyamprakash was superb and needs special mention.

Hindi Medium isn't really a movie. This is real; the real story of today's elite parents who think studying in an English Medium school can promise a good life for their children.The Story: Mita and Raj Batra, a rich cloth merchant from Chandni Chowk, are struggling to get their daughter admitted to an English Medium School. The obstacle is their language which is playing a barrier in getting their kid admitted. The school admits kids of only those parents who can speak good English which they aren't. The plot of the movie is the series of incidents that follow when they want to get their kid admitted by hook or crook. Some humour, some satire and some reality make the plot very poignant.My Review: Story flows on how the English language divides our nation into various parts with the English Spoken few makes the elites of them all. The desi spoken ones; however rich are being considered to be pariah. Great Story, great comic timing, and great acting by Saba Qamar, Deepak Dobriyal, Sanjana Sanghi. Deepak Dobriyal steals your heart apart, Saba Qamar in her debut Hindi movie acts so effortlessly but it is Irrfan Khan who has nailed it like a Super Hero.What makes it more striking is, the family in Hindi Medium is a happy go lucky family, living their life in their own terms, a happy wife, a sweet kid and a rich cloth merchant. All was going on well until they realize the difficulty they have to face when they want to admit their kid in an English Medium School. Even a Prime Minister's office can't assure admission.For the sake of their kid, they move to posh Vasant Vihar which has the elite people of Delhi living in. For social recognition, they want to get their kid admitted in an English Medium School. Even a consulting firm who specializes in getting kids admitted to English Medium school couldn't help. The consultant played by Tilottoma Shome advised them to play a poor family since as per Right to Education Act, some percentage of seats are reserved for poor people. So Batras shift to a Basti temporarily informing their neighbours that they are going to Paris. They visit a photo studio to click pictures with Paris scenes in background so as to post them in Social Networking site to convince their neighbours.Chemistry between Irrfan Khan and Saba Qamar is par excellence. Cinematography, songs, editing are average. The film hasn't gone stereotype and rather looks very different than all those movies you see these days. Saket Chaudhary's Hindi Medium deserves all the compliments it gets because of the inimitable storytelling and presentation. Amrita Singh is wasted in a miniscule character.If the movie is at all watchable, there are so many factors to it. The unstoppable Irrfan Khan, the debutante Saba Qamar, the superlative acting by Deepak Dobriyal, the simple yet beautiful storyline, the comic timings of all the actors. Everything about the movie is just awesome.There are few drawbacks as well but I won't mention them because the perfection is much better and scores more than the drawbacks.Hindi medium is enormously charming; light hearted romantic comedy, and a socio political satire on education system and the elite class's charm for English Medium Schools. So, if you still haven't watched the movie, don't miss it. Once you are out of the theatre, I am sure, you can relate to Mithu, and her husband Raj and they are going to stay in your heart for a longer time than usual.",

Here, a set of parents wanting the best for their child, are forced to choose between their morals and their child's future.The parents want to get their child enrolled into a good school so they can ensure a bright future for their daughter. The problem is, they do not belong to the particular background that school authorities have a natural bias toward. In turn, they are forced to take special lessons so they can appear sophisticated and refined. When that fails to work, they have to stoop down to more deviant ways to make sure their child gets the admission into a prestigious school.The disconnect between the rich and the poor world is shown with great effect. The snootiness of the rich and the kindness and solidarity among the poorer families added a very real touch to the tone of the film. The characters are portrayed with much beauty and charm and I loved Irrfan Khan's acting. He was funny and also shone in the emotional scenes. Saba Qamar was good in her role as the slightly annoying, overbearing mother whose singular interest is in getting her child into a prestigious school. Deepak Dobriyal's character was beautiful and I really became emotional at his turn as the poor man with a heart of gold.I loved this film. This made me deeply emotional and also made me laugh at times. Beautiful.",

But I am talking about the era where every movie that came out of Bollywood was a winner. No stupid, forced jokes, unnecessary dialogues, even the songs that came were amazing. But gone is that era. So whenever a movie like this comes, I am bound to write a review about it because it deserves all my words and energy. Honestly, I would not write about the movie much because you have to kinda feel it and not read it. Saba Qamar is a versatile actress. She has been giving amazing performances in Pakistani dramas and now she's here in India to break stereotypes. She doesn't use her body to get objectified. She plays a role that matches her male co-star in every step. Unlike the scripts that Yami Gautam has been doing, this movie actually giver her something to do. What can be said about Irrfan Khan? Whatever he touches, it turns gold. You can actually feel what the character is going through. But the scene stealer in this movie is definitely Deepak Dorbiyal. My God, Salman who? It is so heartbreaking to see a man working so good, but doesn't get the accolades he deserves. He is the best there is. He makes you feel, cry, emote, laugh with him.",

It also probes at the non-transparency in the admissions process of elite schools in Delhi, especially when it comes to complying with the 25% mandatory reservations for the poor as per the Right to Education (RTE) Act. Particularly insidious is the increasing capitalization of education, which goes on to further the divide between the quality of education provided in public vs private schools. And as with any business, comes consultants, thus the movie brings out the ridiculous nature of training that both parents and kids have to undergo in order to secure a primary education today.The end may be a bit Bollywood, but it certainly drives home an attempt to create an equity between public and private schooling. This movie takes the industry's game up by a notch, as it is very rare in Bollywood these days, to see a humorous satirical movie made to address an important issue. Lastly, a stellar performance by Irrfan Khan :)",

Firstly, showing the love story of young Mita and Raj seems totally pointless and has no connect to the story. Secondly, the point made by the schools that they would not accept a shopkeeper's child, even though when the parents can pay is simply unpalatable (In India, paise ke sab deewane). In such a scenario, the couple (Raj and Mita) makes a stupid decision to start living in a poor locality, which by the way could be avoided by simply sending their daughter to any other good school (there is no dearth of schools that take donation). Raj leaves his well established business in Delhi and joins a factory worker job, c'mon guys is this realistic in anyway. To top it all, Amrita Singh who is earlier shown as an honest and upright woman, turns out to be corrupt.\nOverall a miserable try to address an important social issue. \nRest, Irfan, Saba Qamar and Deepak Dobriyal have acted very well, but the storyline fails to do them justice.",

The strength of the movie lies in the fact that the director is focused on the subject which means love stories, songs, family ties take a backseat. However, he avoids getting into the familiar trap of preaching, instead adopting a subtle route to drive home the point.\nIrrfan and Saba's earnest efforts make the characters relatable and believable in the craziest moments. One such moment is Irrfan dancing to Sukhbir's superhit in the party much to the chagrin of Saba. Another wonderful moment is when Deepak Dobriyal falls in front of a car to help Irrfan with funds. Deepak is in great form in this scene and throughout the movies but sadly the same can't be said about Irrfan who lands the punches well but falters in the emotional scenes of the movies. The director also seems to lose the plot in the last 20 mins giving the audience a cliched, preachy climax which doesn't fit well with the ingenious story.\nThese are however minor blips in what is meaningful wholesome entertainment for the family.",

Like every parents they also wanted their child to get admitted in Best school(English medium) in the society so that child can get enough knowledge and became well established in future. It is the movie which is show how a language can be barier for parents to get admitted to their child how the English language play a role for finding education level of the people. How can anyone judge a person on the basis of just a language. Moreover if parents don't know it doesn't mean that child can't learn now a days their are different means from where we can get the knowledge easily. If any person know a language and he have enough knowledge on other languages then how one particular language can judge a person education level. In this movie parent tried everything to let their child to admitted to Best English medium school .\nThey started to living in other place,they change their life style,form filling up the form they went to writer.Finally they understand language is not a barrier but from any school their child can learn and get enough knowledge to become well-established in society.
