I haven't read the novels, so cannot really comment on the source material. Dakota Johnson hit the corruptible ingenue character pretty well, and looks smashing while doing so. Jamie Dornan, though... In my comments on the first movie, I compared his depth of emotion to a terminator. In this one, he at least attempts some emotional scenes. He doesn't do them very well, but he tries. Supporting cast, especially Marcia Gay Harden, were pretty good, with the exception of Kim Basinger. There is really no reason to see this, except as a continuation of the first movie. It could never stand alone.",

This is soft-core porn for girls and I noticed that the screening I attended was almost entirely a female audience. Though be aware that the erotic scenes are not the kind of sex girls want to see or probably enjoy. I didn't care about the lead actors, who had very little chemistry in between the sex scenes and even those were pretty dull, the elevator scene is a good example of what I mean. The plot is poor, the drama is rubbish, the acting is wooden, and the dialogue is laughable rubbish. The film is unintentionally funny when supposed to be serious, and boring when supposed to be sexy. Although sexier than the original film (my wife tells me) not as graphically sexy as the book. I sat through the pain of this and at the end felt glad I wasn't Christian Grey, though being a billionaire is always very appealing. So in summary, this is a rubbish sequel to the original garbage but will do very well because it's been released over the limited window coinciding with the Valentine's period.",

However only a few minutes in and I already felt the urge to leave and fill my brain with something less awful and mind rotting.It's not just the non-existent plot and hammy acting that let this film down, although they were major factors, the chemistry between the two leads was like watching two planks of wood getting together. None of what I saw made me believe he was an irresistible sex god with a dark side. And with Ana, let's just say biting ones lip every time something is suggested gets a bit old.Furthermore, without wanting to spoil, is her IQ supposed to be about 50? I have to ask because she pretty much agrees to everything he says, and not in a dom/sub kind of way, more just because she doesn't seem to have the mental ability to argue. You have to wonder how she's employed in the first place.I've seen some absolutely dire films but I can honestly say this is the worst film I've ever seen.",

As long as he is rich and good looking, then it's worth it to you and you will enjoy this movie. This movie is designed for you. There is nothing special or interesting about these characters or the one dimensional background cast. You're watching them date for an hour and a half with an vanilla sex scene for every ten to fifteen minutes of talking. There is no conflict or problems in this movie. All the scenes of potential conflicts of the trailer are resolved within minutes after they happen. Anastasia has no backbone in this movie. She gripes and complains about not doing what he wants, then go ahead and do whatever he wants anyway.So if you want to see a movie about Anastasia and Christian date for two hours and have sex, then this is the movie for you.Pros: I liked the first movie because it was so bad it was funny and the soundtrack was good. This movie is literally the two of them getting back together and dating and the soundtrack was okay.",

Anastasia is slowly allowed into his family.I had low expectations before watching this and I'm not eager for it. It's either a low bar to clear or a preconceived notion. There is a bit of both. Johnson is a perfectly appealing actress but she's not allowed to do much. Dornan continues to be a stiff actor. Despite the promise of the edgy sexual matter, their romance is as boring as heck. Leila could have been a compelling thriller villain but she ends up as a secondary plot. The family drama is hinted at but delivers very little. There's a ridiculously undramatic helicopter crash for very little result. I don't hate this but I just find it boring.",

            "review_title": "Somehow worse than the first one",
            "content": "I hated Fifty Shades Of Grey. Non-sensical, poorly written and painfully dull, there was very little to like about that movie. That's why I'm absolutely baffled that its sequel is even worse. Continuing on from where the original left off with an utterly tedious and ridiculous story, nothing about Fifty Shades Darker grabbed me, whilst it loses any sense of the sleek, or even risky, nature of the first film.The main reason that this film is so bad is the story. Featuring consistently incomprehensible twists and turns from start to finish that make an already dull story even less compelling, there was nothing here that got me intrigued in the lives of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.And whilst the first film was tedious for its almost inactive story, following a weak Anastasia being suppressed by Christian, the fact that the sequel, which does have a modicum of character development, fails to provide any more intrigue or drama is unbelievable. We see Anastasia stronger against Christian, which adds a different dynamic to the relationship, but in turn makes the central focus of the entire series feel irrelevant.As a result, we get all these random extra characters flying in and out of the lead duo's lives that are supposed to have some sort of dramatic impact. Almost as inconsequential as some of the scenes from The Room, the new players in this sequel, namely Kim Basinger and Bella Heathcote's characters, appear completely out of the blue, and don't play anywhere near enough of a role to have the intended dramatic effect.In short, whilst there's a lot more going on in Fifty Shades Darker than its predecessor, it somehow manages to make everything even more boring. The main relationship is completely stale, the character development is under-utilised, and the new characters turn the film into some sort of weird, nightmarish soap opera that doesn't make one bit of sense.Then we move onto the performances. Now, I like Dakota Johnson. She's a perfectly good actress who's put in some great performances over the past few years, but this really isn't one of them. In an almost identical situation to Kristen Stewart in Twilight, Johnson gives a laughably underwhelming performance lumbered by horrific dialogue and a tedious character. She can do a lot better, but she's not able to bring her talents to the table in this film, and that makes her just as poor as everything else in Fifty Shades Darker.Alongside Johnson, we have Jamie Dornan. As a character, Christian Grey feels (somehow) even less developed than last time out, and that means that Dornan, whose performance was pretty dull in the first film, doesn't add much to the film at all, coming off as wooden and disinterested as he did before. Meanwhile, the likes of Kim Basinger, Bella Heathcote, Marcia Gay Harden and Eric Johnson, all of whom play in supporting roles, add almost nothing to the story. Again, their characters are as thin as paper, and the dialogue they're given is horrific, but the performances don't do much to rectify those issues.Everything I've said so far is the sort of stuff you'd expect from Fifty Shades Darker, especially after the first film. However, what's genuinely disappointing for me about this sequel is how it almost completely loses the best part of the dire original.Director Sam Taylor-Johnson left the project after an alleged spate with author of the books, E.L. James. In her place is James Foley, whose directing style just isn't as strong. I genuinely thought that Fifty Shades Of Grey was a well-directed movie. Slick, modern and with a slight air of tension and mystery (even if it was far less risky than you'd expect), there was something about Taylor-Johnson's style that grabbed me.Unfortunately, Foley doesn't manage to do the same. Fifty Shades Darker has a little bit of style from time to time, and the directing is still the best part of the movie, but it's a far cry from what we know can be done with this awful story, and with a much duller and less slick visual style, I was even more disappointed with this movie than I ever thought possible.Overall, it's pretty clear that Fifty Shades Darker is a horrific film. Somehow worse and more boring than its terrible predecessor, it does nothing to build on the story we saw last time out, instead opting for a soap opera-esque structure full of random characters with completely incomprehensible motives. The performances are bad, the writing is atrocious, and even the directing is poor.",

Those filthy rich beautiful people in their penthouse apartments and spacious mansions, sipping Mo\u00ebt & Chandon and wearing the finest silks and designer leathers. GRRR! But are they happy? Really happy? Let's strip away their false facades...did you say STRIP? Yes, it's time once again for another chapter of the rich and famously good-looking Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and his love slave, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), in part two of their pseudo sadomasochistic romance saga...this one entitled Fifty Shades Darker.\ufffcThis film steps into the dark side of love once again, or at least that's its soft porn message. Lots of groping, some nudity, very little real passion or sexual tension. In this chapter, He wants back with She, after their previous break-up. He woos and plies her with lavish presents. She accepts his advances with a minimum of resistance as He works his way back into her loins. Sure they have lots of baggage, but their supposedly hot sex is insatiable. The Red Room calls. Bring out the whips, straps, and sexual paraphernalia that can still shock middle America's Puritan values. It's showtime!\ufffcDirector James Foley and Niall Leonard (a.k.a. E. L. James' husband) are the responsible parties for this misdemeanor. Let's call Mr. Foley's involvement bad judgment on his part. His direction here is adequate at best. As for our screenwriter, it's nice that the James's try to keep it in the family, but unleashing this trash to the general public should be a criminal act. Fifty Shades Darker wants to be soft core sex fantasy, melodramatic soap opera, and, in this second chapter, a mystery thriller. The wafer-thin plot (although there is one this time) involves spurned former lovers, unhinged stalkers, and lecherous bosses with questionable intentions. But all the movie becomes is a hilarious comedy of errors (mostly due to the cast and filmmakers). It's a real mess, destined for most critic's worst film list of 2017...including mine. \ufffcThe dialog is unintentionally funny, the characters cardboard silly, and the plot absurd.For example, here are some of the verbal exchanges:\"I don't know whether to worship at your feet or spank you.\" \"Okay, fine. I will have dinner with you because I am hungry.\" \"You're not sticking those up my butt.\"Shakespeare needn't worry.The most well defined part of this drool is Mr. Dornan's abs which get quite a workout. His character lacks any dimension unless erect (and that is never shown and only intimated, of course). As for Ms. Johnson, her ample cleavage and perky breasts share equal screen time and should have star billing status as well. The actress establishes her character as a series of girlish pouts, wide-eyed ogling, and sensual lip-biting. Both performers are more silly than sexy. These physical fit actors have done better work in other films, but they did choose fame and an almighty fat check for their involvement in this series, so the blame is partially theirs as well as the filmmakers. However, I will credit them with some some acting restraint in delivering the banal dialog with the straightest of poker faces. That must have been the only thing hard on the set. \ufffc Bad acting is also prevalent in the supporting cast of characters. Two Oscar winning actresses, Marcia Gay Harden and Kim Basinger should have known better. Up and coming actors like Eric Johnson, Bella Heathcote, Rita Ora, and Luke Grimes bring some class to their classless roles. All go the soap opera route, lots of hysteria and excess.In fact, there are so many ripe displays of excesses, definitely the fault of a woeful script: many stagy sex romps that register 1 on the hot meter, especially that classic steamy shower scene, an elevator tryst that is more laughable than sensual, and a rather silly set piece involving a Venetian styled masquerade ball that is reminiscent of Kubrick's only dud, Eyes Wide Shut, (which is the best advice one can give to viewing this movie, although it is the filmmakers who should really hide.) \ufffc Fifty Shades Darker is dim indeed. Still planning to take your significant other to this awful movie? Perhaps then I might suggest a \"safe word\" for all film lovers: AVOID!",

            "content": "My God, Where to begin? this movie was awful in so many ways that make a list would be such a waste of time. Anyway, I can mention the most prominent and substantial to me, starting by the most elementary piece which is the idea behind the whole story, in other words the subtext or message that the film delivers. This is no other thing but a teenager wet dream, founded on the most shameless shallowness and superficiality: Is the story of a naive young girl obsessed with the actual prototype of perfect spouse in every aspect important for the society, millionaire, handsome, fit, hard-sex addict, possessive and tough guy, so tough that he even resists an helicopter crash to come back without a scratch; so basically what the movie tries to unfold it's an attempt to tell a story where this girl keeps striving to catch this guy and engage him into a \"serious relationship\" without all of his flaws and addictions, in this process all of his evil ex's and spooky characters of his past will try to stop her in such predictable manners that you will have to throw some popcorn to others in theater to get amused if possible. This links to the second aspect to bring up: The Script. This script is so dull and predictable that you would regret buying your ticket in the first 15 min, it's so dummy and felts so unreal that in some point gets laughable, the characters and dialogues are so shallow and the plot twists are far more predictable than fast and furious or any bad horror movie. Linked to that the actors don't help too much, it could be enough with that script but no, the director and producers want you to suffer in every possible way, they throw you a complete platter of mediocrity performances, overacted and fictitious, filled with nonsensical dialogues and cheap jokes. In the technical aspect there's no much to say, it's another big studio fail, a nearly invisible treatment in the visual camp, mediocre photography, sound mixing and editing which is refilled with pop music to solve the problem. In conclusion, 50 Shades Darker it's the perfect opportunity to get your daughter most desired obsessions emerged, or even your girlfriend can connect to the cheap-fake fairy tale of sex and passion this movie delivers.",

The sex scenes are not sexy, and what makes them even less sexy is the music during the scenes. The MAJOR problem I had with the film is how Anastasia is written.

The Hitch was of course referring to religion but both religion and the long term sexual relationship have an identical definition . I'm also reminded of how Albert Einstein described idiocy:\"Doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result\" . In the case of the 50 SHADES narrative we're subjected to idiotic masochism If you've seen the first film you'll be entirely puzzled as to the casting because I don't think I've seen an actor and actress so badly cast in a film where the whole concept of the story revolves around sexual attraction . Both Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are two actors best suited for lead roles in a bland daytime soap opera . Let's remind ourselves Christian Grey is a multi billionaire oozing in Byronic sexuality while Ana Steele is , or rather was a na\u00efve young woman embarking on an intensely mind blowing sexual relationship with Grey and the casting really does not work . In fact several sexually charged scenes are unintentionally funny and will cause howls of laughter as the two leads spout their lines before engaging in sex . Add to this as a possible love rival in the form of Jack Hyde as played by Eric Johnson and you've got a hat trick of actors with the sexual charisma of drowned haddock . Casting Kim Basinger in a small role makes things worse because you're reminded of her on screen chemistry with Mickey Rourke in 91/2 WEEKS which while not being a great film did have an erotic quality to it and despite some fairly explicit sex scenes for a mainstream Hollywood movie in 50 SHADES DARKER it's fairly devoid of erotica",

            "content": "Hopefully, as a heterosexual female student in her twenties with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades, this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me.Like as was said in my review for 'Fifty Shades of Grey', have not read the books, though have heard conflicting opinions that has mostly been intense dislike. The reason for watching 'Fifty Shades Darker' was not due to wanting to hate on it, being a negative person, curiosity but for the reason of being at a film night with friends (who liked the books) recently and 'Fifty Shades Darker', like with 'Fifty Shades of Grey', happened to be the film choice. Just for the record, the general consensus ranged from indifference to hating it with a passion.'Fifty Shades Darker' is a small improvement over its predecessor but not by much. The flaws are still the same but it's not as quite as near-irredeemably bad, and it at least tries to give some raunchy edge while not exactly succeeding.Once again, the beguiling soundtrack, that has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality, is the best thing about it. It also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot. There is one acting bright spot, which is Marcia Gay Harden who does very well with her role.However, the same flaws are all here. Like 'Fifty Shades of Grey', Danny Elfman's score is one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. Despite the change of director, the directing style feels too mannered and there is a real sense that the director was ill-suited to material that is beneath him, after all he's done stuff like 'House of Cards' and 'Glengarry Glenn Ross'.The rest of the supporting cast fail to stand out, with Kim Basinger having little to do, next to nothing actually. More problematic once more are the two leads, and the chemistry is next to zero once more. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent.Again, the dialogue does no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story that is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long. Even with attempts to give more raunchiness and kinkiness, as well as edge, none of it comes over naturally, feeling horribly contrived. The rest of it is done far too tamely and the BDSM portrayal is still deceitful. The characters are little more than ciphers.Overall, a small improvement but still pretty dreadful even when giving it a fair chance. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

Actually this was the first time I went to the movie theater knowing that the movie I'm going to see is going to be terrible. I just wanted to see, if it is possible to make worse movie than what the first one was. (I did like the books. I think they were entertaining, when you don't take them too seriously.)Jamie Dornan is great looking guy, but he just has no clue, what kind of character Christian Grey is. Dornan's acting was so clumsy that it was awkward. When he was supposed to be angry and furious to Ana and he shouted \"Where the f**k have you been\", it was hysterical. I mean, there was no character or anger in his voice or body language, and it felt like he had never used the f-word before. It was like he was reading the script, but had no idea what else he was supposed to do. And Dornan hasn't obviously never slapped someone on the butt, because that scene, where he was spanking Anastasia, was so awkward that I don't even have words for it. So basically the whole movie was off and unrealistic and not in a good way. And because it was so terrible, the audience was laughing a lot. The scenes which were supposed to be sexy, dramatic or tense, were anything but. Darker was titled as a drama, so i'm guessing that the movie makers didn't plan that Darker would make people laugh more than an average comedy. And I am not even exaggerating how much people laughed during the movie. It was almost every other scene. If you expect to see some nudity, then you get something more than in the first movie, but nothing really \"shocking\" or exciting. Anastasia takes her panties off like 20 times, but that just doesn't make a movie hot, sweaty or interesting.So if you want to see a terrible movie that has nothing to do with eroticism, drama or good acting, then this is your movie.",

The thriller narrative, involving persons from Grey's strange past, exposes the shallowness of the story.

He buys up enlarge pictures of her that are being sold at a friend's photography gallery display and continues to send her gifts. Anastasia has started working at a small publishing company under her jealous boss Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson). Anastasia agrees to have dinner with Christian and they reignite their passionate romance though she still has reservations despite his insistence to give her money. Christian is still in touch with his old lover and the one who taught him about BDSM, Elena Lincoln (Kim Basinger). Anastasia is also being stalked by one of Grey's old submissives Kate Kavanaugh (Eloise Mumford). These strange occurrences never amount to much and the drama is alway overshadowed by the need to show another sex scene.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",

She's trying to move on but he still loves her and wants her. She decides to give him a second chance but has to deal with two of his exes--one wants her dead and the other (Kim Basinger) says she can never have him.I liked the first movie and I liked this too. The acting is better than the first. I always though Dornan was lousy in the first but he's better her. Johnson was great. Marcia Gay Harden is great in a supporting role. Even Basinger was good! As for sex and nudity--there are sex scenes and they're tasteful but explicit. And (naturally) Johnson shows more skin than Dornan. Also every single romantic clich\u00e9 in existence is worked into the movie. I'm not complaining about that but it doesn't always work.

It does seem to follow on fairly logically from the first film, but if you're stepping in for the first time, you shouldn't have too many problems picking up the gist of things. I'd never try to argue the storyline is all that deep.Dakota Johnson makes the film for me. She is a very appealing Ana and carries off the the vulnerable/strong character thing really well. Unlike some of the other reviewers around these parts, I think she succeeds in displaying plenty of chemistry with Christian. And speaking of that well-known male dominant, let me just add that I think Jamie Dornan plays that part quite well. Yes, he does appear kind of wooden and emotion-lite, but that's the way Christian is written in the books. And as many are aware, author EL James had a very big influence in the adaption of her books to the screen. For a start, her hubby Niall Leonard, is the sole script writer! All those expecting a vastly different screen persona of Christian are just whistling into a gale of a wind.It was fun seeing Kim Bassinger turn up playing Elena, considering she starred in Nine and a Half Weeks, back 30 years or so ago and that film kicked up the same sort of reaction from critics as 50 Shades etc. ( It was also a commercial hit.) I'd never try to deny that the films all share great similarities. But that's Hollywood for you! What goes around, definitely comes back around!Now about those little balls ...",

Again dakota was functionable. Jamie was stale, tried to put more emotion into his character which came out unnatural, etc. The side characters were over the top. The only actor i liked was the \"stalker girl\" you see in the trailers. She brought at least something interesting. Both moms also acted well though. 3/10 Story: The story wasn't as bad as the first one was. There was a new interesting addition to it with Christian greys past, but it was executed so poorly.. It felt like the writers were like: god.. we cant do the same thing... what about a girl from greys past that stalks him... yea yea great. There were a few events which had nothing interesting to add to the story. It was just there as fillers.. I won't say much except for \"helicopter-scene\" and you'll know what im talking about. All in All, horrible as expected. 2/10 Characters: enough could be said about mr grey etc, but the one thingI hate is constantly seeing weak women characters in movies. Ana isn't just weak... she gets convinced in a relationship she purely was against 10 minutes into the movie, gives him a kiss of a lifetime after their first date because he gave her a present, didn't go to new york for her job because mr. grey said she couldn't... etc. etc. etc. i could go on and on, but when multiple women write a story at least let her be strong in 1 single scene. she even had to be rescued by him TWICE! 4/10Dialogue: this.. i cant take seriously. Again Mr. Grey would horrible stupid lines which could only make soccer moms panties wet. It was so bad and unbelievable. You can tell the husband of the writer of the stories let in lines he normally would reject. \"You're too... dressed\" goddddd. 1/10 Cinematography: Again great. The movie overall might be sh*t but the cinematography is always beautiful and well filmed.Rated R-stuff: Yea, they did it again. Not a lot of SM this time around. This time 3 out of 5 sex scenes didn't even feel sexy, but bland. Every scene was leading up to these scenes and normally i wouldn't mind that, if it had been interesting to watch. At least the first one had some sexy mystery to mr. grey, but now he is what we all thought he was: a controlling, stalking and abusive freak. 7/10 Verdict: Why bother? its a badly scripted romantic drama with soft-core-porn intentions, which don't play out very well. You cant even laugh anymore at how bad it is. Its just bad and sad to see a movie like this make money. Bad acting, story and horrible dialogue... go see LA LA LAND, any other Oscar contenders, or the lego batman film or john wick.. go see anything but this guys!",

            "content": "I firmly believe that if Fifty Shades of Grey had a good writer, director, and good actors, it could have been an awesome, sexy, psychological thriller. However, the filmmakers instead went for the romance angle, and the finished product was a painfully bad mess. With its sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, I went in with an open mind, hoping that maybe the filmmakers learned from the first movie, and possibly could make a decent movie. Sadly, that's not the case. Fifty Shades Darker is a laughable, piece of garbage.Before I get into what's wrong with this monstrosity, I have to admit: like the first one, I enjoyed the soundtrack. That's the one positive that this movie has.Now it's time to talk about why I hated this movie. First of all, the romance between Ana and Christian is not interesting or immersive. I honestly never felt a connection between the two of them. With the bad acting and the poorly written behaviors of both characters, it was hard to believe that they had any sort of feelings for each other. Speaking of which, let's talk about the writing. More specifically, how utterly baffled I was by how bad it was. All I could think was \"How did a script like this go through so many people and still be this bad?\" For example, there is a part where Christian discloses something about his early life to Ana, and she says \"You never told me that.\" To which Christian replies \"Yes I did. You were asleep when I told you.\" I literally snickered out loud in the theater when he said that. And that was just one of the many cringe-inducing lines in the film.The film also has no structure whatsoever. It felt like the writers just made the events of the story up as they went along without an outline or plan as to how the story was going to go. For instance, there is a random scene that lasts less than five minutes where Christian is involved in some sort of accident, then comes back from the accident completely unharmed and the event is never mentioned again. It was utterly pointless and only served to tack on a few extra minutes onto the run time.And of course, with this being a Fifty Shades of Grey movie, I have to talk about the sex scenes. In short, they're bad. Just very bad. From what I remember of the previous film, there are less sex scenes in Fifty Shades Darker. However, that doesn't stop them from being completely abysmal, awkward, and painful. The sex scenes are very poorly edited, shot, and put together. All in all, Fifty Shades Darker gets a 2/10 from me. I have to admit: I am a little disappointed that this movie turned out so bad. I will not be duped by the Fifty Shades of Grey series again. Among seeing the first and second film, I have lost all hope in any sort of redemption in the final film and I most certainly am not looking forward to it. Please do not give this movie any of your precious time or hard earned money. Fifty Shades Darker is not worth your time and should be avoided at all costs",

            "content": "In 2011, the erotic romance novel \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", by then-unknown writer E.L. James, took the publishing world by storm. And what a storm it was! James only started writing in 2009 \u2013 fan fiction based on the \"Twilight\" movies and books, but by the end of 2012 (after the publication of \"Fifty Shades Darker\" and \"Fifty Shades Freed\"), \"Publishers Weekly\" named James \"Publishing Person of the Year\" and she made \"Time\" magazine's list of \"The 100 Most Influential People in the World\"\u0085 and that storm I referenced\u0085 had turned nasty. Authors as prominent as Salmon Rushdie derided the novels as poorly written, while others debated whether the BDSM theme around which the plot revolved depicted an abusive relationship. Nevertheless, James' mostly female readership enjoyed the romance between the main characters and James made $100 million in 2013, $5 million of which was for the rights to film the first book in her trilogy. \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" hit theaters in 2015 and, despite mostly negative reviews from critics, the movie banked over 14 times what it cost to make and the second and third films in the trilogy were filmed concurrently in early 2016. The critics can say what they will about E.L. James, her stories and the movies that her books inspired, but millions of people all over the world have been entertained by the \"Fifty Shades\" saga, including the second film, 2017's \"Fifty Shades Darker\" (R, 1:58).The movie picks up a few months after the na\u00efve, but strong recent college graduate Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and the controlling and sexually adventurous billionaire businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) said an emotional \"goodbye\" by simply uttering each other's names at Christian's elevator. Ana has started a new job as an administrative assistant to Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson), the handsome head of the Fiction Department at Seattle Independent Publishing. Christian finds Ana at a gallery showing for a photographer friend and Christian talks Ana into joining him to get something to eat. Soon after, Jack, who has shown an interest in Ana that went beyond the professional, convinces Ana to join him for a drink at a local bar and Christian soon shows up. The two men take out their penises and measure them. Christian wins, taking Ana with him as he leaves the bar, but Jack isn't quite ready to admit defeat. (That last part was metaphorical, but very much in the spirit of this story, so\u0085) As Ana and Christian resume their relationship in fits and starts, the terms have changed, new challenges arise and old jealousies are aroused. Christian agrees that this time there will be no rules and no punishments and his relationship with Ana will be a \"vanilla\" one. Ana worries that Christian will be unable to give up the kinkier aspects of their physical relationship, but he assures her that she is more important to him than his need to dominate his lovers. This time, Ana is on top (again, metaphorically speaking) as she calls the shots and even shows a continuing interest in some of Christian's sexual toys and tricks \u2013 as long as she isn't again compelled to surrender control. Meanwhile, one of Christian's previous submissives, a clearly disturbed young brunette named Leila (Bella Heathcote), keeps popping up, as does Elena Lincoln (Kim Basinger), aka \"Mrs. Robinson\", the woman who first introduced Christian to the BDSM lifestyle. We also learn more about Christian's early life and why he is the way he is.\"Fifty Shades Darker\" has a better story and may even be sexier than its predecessor. The plot is\u0085 well, darker, with elements of a thriller mixed in with the romance and the sex, and with a new director (James Foley) and a new screenwriter (Niall Leonard \u2013 adapting his wife's novel), it's more broadly entertaining. Like the first film, there's plenty of sex in this one, but it's less (a little less) \"kinky\" and more romantic than previously. The insights into Christian's background, including meeting more women from his past, also gives the plot more depth as both Ana and Christian each have more at stake, emotionally-speaking. This movie won't win any Oscars, but it's pretty\u0085 f---ing enjoyable. \"A-\"",

The film is mild soft porn, and I found it detrimental to women that Dakota Johnson continually got undressed, yet Jamie Dornan only stripped down in virtually the last scene, It was as though ' I am the star of this film, and I will not stoop to humiliate myself ' ( although I am getting a small fortune to do so.....) Coming to Jamie Dornan, who was excellent in The Fall, is so bad in this, apart from his looks ....he was recently on The Graham Norton Show, and had a heavy beard and shocking haircut, he came over as a shy and boring guy in real life, although he was being ridiculed by Kiano Reeves.....however no excuse for another wooden performance as the I thought , charismatic and Bond like Christian Grey.

            "content": "I might get a lot of hate for this but I actually liked it. Hear me out though. It's still stupid and has incredibly dumb moments. However, the entertainment factor has been upped since the first film. The actors are more comfortable in their roles and it shows. There is also more of a charm to this film and the love scenes and cinematography are much more sleek. Its all around stronger than the first. I think your reaction to the first and the genre in general will effect your reaction to Fifty Shades Darker though.This film picks up where the last one left off. Christian Grey tries to rekindle his romance with Anastasia Steele. Their bond becomes stronger but there are new variables and explorations of Christian's past. But through all this the two endure and actually hit relationship milestones. This film is definitely more sweet among the darkness. The leads are in a happier place and they reach a place of certainty emotionally and sexually. The love scenes are more exquisite and are supplemented with great music. I love that song by Zayn and Taylor and loved hearing it during the boat ride. Some of the locality is amazing and it shows in the cinematography.That said, the film still has narrative problems. The dialogue (while better) is still clich\u00e9d and predictable. Motivations are still questionable, some side characters are still thrown into the mix and so underdeveloped. Where the hell did Rita Ora come from? Shes is probably in the first but I can't recall right now. None of the supporting cast is there for a long time and are not given enough say. Some plot progression just happens so suddenly that you are there just scratching your head like \"wtf\"? Two key events (if they can even be called that) are so incredibly stupid. The film isn't that smart at times but lets face the truth. Its based on probably very awful books so something must be going right if the film is somehow enjoyable.I know I'm in the complete minority with liking this film. I think the first is a guilty pleasure and kind of in the bad its good territory. Its more of the same with this film but its definitely a more unified and sleeker production. There's not a lot of urgency in the film but I don't know if that's how the adapted material is supposed to be. The film somehow does set itself up for a third one though. Overall, the film is exactly what its marketed as: a popcorn date movie that ladies and some guys will enjoy as a mindless but nice looking film. Also big P.S. Dakota Johnson is a goddess.7/10",

Can't wait for the second part parody, bad as the previous ofc but better than FSD for sure.P.S.

I can only imagine having to come back and star in and promote such bile for a second time must be even more painful than the first film. I genuinely think Dornan looks embarrassed throughout the film,making it uncomfortable to watch. The image of him inserting the kinky balls of steel (no pun, he actually did) will haunt him for his entire career i am sure Johnson too. The sound track is great and cinematography was good. At one point my mind wandered on how nice the glass was within the office Ana worked at and it was at this point i considered making my run for it out of the cinema, never a good sign that you are thinking of the decor whilst watching a so called erotic film. The sex scenes were really quite tepid,i am sure Mr Grey kept his trousers on for the majority of them ; Most exciting part was wondering if he was going to get his manhood trapped in the zipper of his trousers....... Instead of thinking how steamy it all was i referred back to my constant thought that Mr Dornan must had had written into his contract nudity below the belt must be kept to a minimum, it's a shame Dakota Johnson didn't have the same as her boobies we on show quite a lot, seemed unfair !To be fair to the actors the story is so threadbare that going for a haircut was quite a major scene in the film; There were times within the film that were funny but i'm not sure of they were intentionally written to be; It was quite a cringe feast throughout.Both the main characters have been miscast, Christian Grey needed to be played by a far more sterner, bigger actor than the likable boy next door Dornan, and Ana's character screamed for someone more ..well sexier. I haven't seen Dakota in any other film but i've watched The Fall in which i consider Jamie Dornan to be amazingly brilliant, i don't see how he can flip flop between being so good and so bad; I guess it's down to the script?It's a shame that Fifty shades has been singled out for stardom as there are far better books to draw such saucy screen plays from which actually have a story to them, stories that the actors might actually have some good dialogue to work with.",

            "content": "I think the 'Fifity Shades' movies were always going to have a tough task in front of them to please people. The reason? Because it is so hard for them to balance everything. Audiences want intense sex scenes - but not pornography, they want a genuine love story to be created - but they want it done quickly so there is plenty of time left over for the kinky stuff, they want boundaries to be pushed - but again not porn and nothing that is going to make them uncomfortable. That's all fine, but then consider that almost every audience is going to want different degrees of each of these aspects, and you're pretty much doomed before you even put pen to pad.With books, generally only the people that are interested in them end up reading them. However this is not the same for movies. Because very few people are comfortable going to movies on their own, they end up dragging along people with them who are less enthused about the film, and thus a lot of the negativity is created. I don't think it's deserved. People need to go into these movies with what they are trying to be in mind. Do that and you're not going to have a bad time. Sadly though, very few people do that - especially around Oscar time when these films tend to be released.'Fifty Shades Darker' is a harmless film. It's a love story with a difference. It's a film that is supposed to make you think a different way about relationships and how we all act towards each other. I can assure you there are far less convincing love stories being made into movies out there. Don't be influenced by the bad publicity out there surrounding these films. Judge them for yourself.",

I would compare this movie to the first, but in times of great mental anguish and pain, your brain has the capability to block certain events out, so fortunately I remember practically nothing about the first movie. I'm praying that these same mental capabilities will once again serve me well. The great mysteries of life are made up of unanswerable questions. Where did the mystery matter that supposedly created the universe come from? Does anything contain the universe? How did the extremely complex cells that make up the simplest life forms come together before dying out forever? What is the meaning of life? Why in the world would I ever watch this movie after seeing the first? There are no solid answers for these questions. The characters. There is really no way to accurately explain just how boring and hollow these characters are, but I will try. Stare at a blank wall for 30 minutes. Now divide the emotion you felt by a number between 4 and, I don't know, 20. If either, or both of these characters was killed off during the movie I probably would have actually felt some emotion, but most likely that emotion would be joy. Good love movies make you fall in love with the characters. They present beautiful people with depth, an incredible sense of humor and above average intelligence and wit. These characters display none of these traits. Sure, I can admit that Christian is a good looking guy, but that's it. The characters are devoid of actual character. The \"complexity\" of Christian is actually quite simple. It makes me feel pity for the director and the women that think this is a good movie because they clearly are so \"basic\" that they really don't understand what depth and complexity look like. This film makes me sad for humanity and reduces what little faith I had in women in general given how many seem to like this movie.In short, I would have no desire to know either of these characters in real life. It should be easy for directors to create characters which surpass people in real life because they have plenty of time to craft lines and witty banter. Nope. Crafting a persona of interest is clearly beyond the realms of possibility for the writers involved in this project. The female lead (I honestly didn't care enough about this movie to remember her name) is completely soulless and is an atrocious actress. Nothing about this movie is believable. The plot feels like it was an amalgamation of a hundred other \"chick flicks\" with BDSM thrown in. The film feels like a puree of high school level relationships where drama needs to be manufactured to make the relationship feel engaging. In real life this relationship would fail because there is zero to it, besides drama and sex. Nothing about this film makes you say \"wow\", or take interest, the viewer simply rides the tramcar of monotony. Even the sex scenes were mundane. How bad do you have to be to make people want to fast forward the sex scenes? It's like Twilight except that the somewhat interesting vampires have been substituted with Ben Wa balls. Is this supposed to be fascinating to anyone? In the end, the movie is poorly acted, with absolutely lifeless characters and sex scenes with all the spice of a sexual education film in a Catholic school. If you're in high school with an underdeveloped personality and long to hit the lottery by marrying into it, you might find this tolerable. However, if you find this tolerable, start hanging out with more interesting people, get some hobbies, listen to talk radio, or do something that will help develop you into a person of depth, with enough intelligence to see how truly horrible this film is.",

According to an IMDb peer reviewer, this movie actually went nowhere. \"This movie is awful, yes, that's the best way to describe this movie. Acting, terrible, the story does not make sense. It's just about sex, and a bad, really poorly written script\" (you're better of just watching reruns of soap operas, such as the \"The Bold & the Beautiful (1987-)\"/ \"Days of our lives\" (1965-), or even \"Passions\" (1999-2007) for free on the telly. \"The soundtrack stood out, and the cinematography is decent. But once again, its a film baiting TEENAGE GIRLS, to go watch (soft porn) in the movie theater (a second time around\").

Finally, KIM BASINGER: HOW DARE SHE BE CAST IN SUCH A TERRIBLE ROLE !! She was Hollywood's DARLING of the 1980s/1990s !! Batman's box office love interest !! I don't care how much she's aged !! Quite disrespectful, in casting her as an \"undesirable\" (same deal with Bella Heathcote - just so terribly underused). Instead of providing a rating, I'll propose a more appropriate title: \"FIFTY SHADES 2: THE VIRTUE, OR IGNORANCE OF RICH PEOPLE AGONIZING OVER LIPSTICK MARKS ON THEIR CHEST\". Plus the film would've worked (much, much better) as a comedy. Think Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room\" (2006). I'm actually not joking about this.

It is just predictable random scenes cut together to achieve movie length. It is meeting again + kiss, instant sex (because otherwise it would have been boring if she would really challenge him), some random party scenes, more boring sex, another scene were he crashes (he returns like Iron Man asking: What are you doing here? Not even a facial expression, which marks the peek of bad acting in this movie and how bad the writing of the dialogues is). + more sex. There are so many logical mistakes and the cringe factors, especially of the dialogues lets me give it 2 stars instead of just one.

Finally, watching this with 15 or 16 years depending how it is age rated in your region, I can almost assume that it gives you the picture/creates a narrative that you have to be a total unromantic spoiled brat to be successful and that this, the way the movie shows it, is the way to treat a women once you have established some connection to her. I almost would have gone more into political aspects or social power relations of this movie here but it is not worth my time and also I guess people are not so interested in this aspects anyway. Throughout the whole movie I was thinking, it would be worth more spending the movie time at home cooking a dinner for your SO than spending money and time on this garbage. The producers should shame themselves and donate some money to real victims of domestic violence and cure for drug addiction. P.S. It was my first review here.",

            "content": "This film is the more-than-announced continuation of the Fifty Shades trilogy, and I think it's the worst of the three. Despite the great success of the box office, in my view largely based on the previous success of the books by E. L. James, the film was precisely booed by both the critics and the public who paid to see it. As I did in the review of the first film, I emphasize here that I neither read nor intend to read the original books, so I will only speak about the film, although I know that many problems related to the story told already come from the original material.After breaking up with Gray, Anastasia decides to resume with him, but under conditions. Her personality changed a lot from one film to the next. She is no longer that shy girl who is unable to break a plate that we saw in the first film. She discovered her own femininity, is more confident and dominates the situation with confidence, almost to the point of reversing sexual roles with Gray. This, in turn, seems lost and not quite sure where to step, in search of firm ground. This was what surprised me most in the story told by the film. The rest (the intrigues and jealousy involving Anastasia's boss and Gray's ex-lover, or even Leila's enigmatic appearance) does not have half the interest that this change in their personality had for me. And the film also has terrible dialogues and one of the most lurid lapses of continuity I have ever seen in cinema: the complicated lingerie that Anastasia takes to the Gray's charity party and that, already on the spot, in yet another sex scene, has mysteriously disappeared of her body, leaving only a simple lacy underwear. I almost burst out laughing. Is there anything good here? Yes, but little. The performance of the two central actors in the plot is noticeably less boring than in the first film, but, as seen earlier, the impersonality and the lack of passion and chemistry between them dominates; Marcia Gay Harden did a good performance as Christian's mother and Kim Basinger was also good at the little he had to doIt goes without saying that this film is totally inappropriate for children and teenagers, given the heavy erotic material and the language used. The film had a good budget and, therefore, good production values, starting with good photography, good scene props, satisfactory editing work and a good soundtrack, composed by Danny Elfman.",

Okay here comes the haters saying \"Why on earth would you go see that piece of crap twice?\" Well to me it's not crap, I loved it. Oh yes I loved it. I think it's a hell of a lot better than the first which I also loved by the way. You can read it here if you like.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2322441/reviews-1365 Like I said I am a huge fan of the series, have all the books, posters, Twiter page etc. The film is the second installment of the FSOG series which Ana and Christian trying to rekindle their relationship and deal with Christian's past that comes back to haunt him. From an obsessive ex sub to a douchbag boss of Ana who wants what's Christian. Oh yeah and let's not forget Mrs Robinson who is jealous of Ana and I don't know why she is a very sweet girl and wants to love Christian and show him that someone cares for him.That's basically the plot of the movie and oh yeah theirs tons of sex in the second film then the first and oh boy is their some sexy time in this film which is great. Oh sure the haters will say that it's just a sex craze film, umm so? Their are tons of films that use sex to sell the plot of the story and they don't get backlish like FSD does which is a shame because its a really great film but since the so-called critics want to bad mouth it people aren't going to see it. Don't let some critic tell you what too watch. YOU make up your own mind. If you've read the book then you'll LOVE this film. Trust me, I saw it twice and am thinking about seeing it again so it can't be bad if I want to see it again right? If I may have a word to these so-called critics out there in the world who say this movie is garbage or worthless. How dare you say that about a movie you don't understand! You are only getting paid to spread your hate towards a film that you're probably not a fan of and want to make yourself look big for bad mouthing the film. Oh and these YouTube film reviewers who talk crap about the movie all cause they want their viewer numbers to rise shame on you! My verdict for the film is a 10, oh yeah a big ol 10. I will be buying this Blu-ray and adding it to my collection. If you're not a fan, then just stay home please and let the fans enjoy the film.",

The cinematography was actually pretty good. Crisp, clear shots. Decent set-up. Beautiful outdoor shots. The music was passable, though not as good as the music in the original. Hair, make-up and wardrobe were good. However, while no movie can include everything from the book,this movie is a long advertisement for the book. Here are some scene teasers- read the book to find out what really happened. It seemed very fly by night in it's assembly. Oh- don't forget to touch on this, spend 30 seconds on that..... The acting was perfunctory at best. Not that Jaime Dornan can act his way out of a paper bag on a really good day, but there seemed to be a \"phone it in\", \"let's get this over with\", quality to everyone's performance. When Marcia Gay Harden isn't convincing, there's a problem. There were a lot of really good, experienced actors in the supporting cast who were underutilized with their 5-7 total lines each. I don't think throwing Mrs. Jones 2 lines added much to the plot. Dakota Johnson did what she could with what she had to work with, but unfortunately the script was even worse than the dialog in the book. The sex scenes were bland, lacking chemistry. Whereas the first movie took it's time to set up the tone and mood for the scenes, this movie was more like- oh yea, in the book they have sex now so let's write in a quick scene before the next crisis happens. And Jaime D has his pants on for all of them. Contract stipulation? Whereas, Dakota was naked for much of the film. Note to filmmaker, people who buy tickets to this movie don't but them to see her naked.",

            "content": "'FIFTY SHADES DARKER': One and a Half Star (Out of Five)The sequel to the 2015 blockbuster erotic romance 'FIFTY SHADES OF GREY'; both films are based on the novels (of the same names) by E.L. James. James's husband, Niall Leonard, wrote the screenplay for this installment, while James co-produced it, and James Foley directed the movie. Actors Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan reprise their starring roles from the first film; and it costars Eric Johnson, Eloise Mumford, Bella Heathcote, Rita Ora, Luke Grimes, Marcia Gay Harden and Kim Basinger. The movie's gotten nearly unanimous negative reviews from critics, and film fans alike (much like the first movie did), but it's been a hit at the Box Office, so far (like the first one was as well), due to it's obsessive book fan base. Both of the novels, and their film adaptations, have been heavily criticized for promoting sexual abuse and violence against women (by The National Center on Sexual Exploitation, and various other people and groups); although the movies are supposedly extremely toned down from the novels their adapted from. I found this sequel to be slightly better than the first one (but just barely though). As the movie opens, Anastasia (Johnson) is still trying to move on from her abusive relationship with Christian (Dornan); while Christian is still stalking and sexually harassing her (but this time he promises he'll change). Anastasia eventually gives into his advances, except this time she insists they play by her rules. Christian agrees, while he continues to abuse her (but not quite as badly as in the first film). Other crazy stalkers, and insane exes from Christian's past, further complicate their relationship this time though. I have a huge problem with the wrong messages these movies, and the books they're adapted from, give their viewers (and readers). If it wasn't so romanticized, and the Christian character was treated more like the negative sexual predator that he is, they wouldn't be so bad; but as it is, these movies (and the books they're based on) are completely irresponsible and harmful to the young and impressionable. They're also really cheesy, and poorly written and acted. This one is a little better made than the first one though, and the Christian character does actually start to change a little (by the end of the movie) but he should have never been given the chance to!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' review at: https://youtu.be/RO7ghqXHCCY",

It is true that the second film takes several liberties as far as staying true to the events in the book, and it would have been impossible to get everything into a two-hour film. However, I agree with what Jamie Dornan said in interviews, that in the second film Christian is a bit more relaxed and also more willing to change/open up, and this was a nice change. I did miss the almost palpable tension between them at times early on in the first film (ex. the scene in Claytons). The costuming and general eye-candy elements were enjoyable. The main shortcoming for me was that they literally had to try to jam in the main events from the book with not enough time to really flesh them out (yeah, I know...). The audience at the screening I attended was almost all female, which to me was not surprising. This is a film for fans of the franchise, and as such it delivered.

Most of these Ultra-successful guys have been burned all over their bodies by cigarettes growing up, DARKER documents, so it's amazing that they're still able to help the U.S. as much as they do. As Leader Trump has demonstrated in at least three of his marriages, most Gentlemen Billionaires behave toward our womenfolk just like those Common People who nurse damaged wild birds back to life. When Dakota Johnston comes into Billionaire Christian Grey's orbit, it's clear that she merits a rating of three or four on the Ten-Point Scale, at best. But thanks to Billionaire Grey's unceasing efforts to salvage her physical appearance, most dudes would rank Ms. Johnston as a solid six and a half by the end of DARKER. Furthermore, DARKER illustrates how these Job-Creating Billionaires allow America's Economy to hum along. From the Crafters of ornate facial coverings for Masquerade Balls to the polishers of wooden yacht decks, it's clear that giants like Leader Trump and Christian Grey are keeping hundreds of us employed as the Wind Beneath Their Wings, to the tune of AT LEAST $7.65 an hour (if their work is satisfactory enough to deserve any paycheck at all, that is). Though no Billionaire in his Right Mind would let these potential leeches have benefits by awarding them full-time work, they're still pocketing a bounty of $14,000 annually (before taxes) while they enjoy ObamaCare (for a couple more weeks).

            "content": "When we left Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) at the end of 'Fifty Shades of Grey', they had parted because she was repelled by the pleasure he got from dominating her in the bedroom. This second film in the trilogy opens an undisclosed amount of time later, with Anastasia living her own life. But Christian can not let go - he sends her flowers on her first day in a new job; and when her friend Jose (who spent the first film pathetically making cow eyes at her) has an exhibition of his photography including six out-sized pictures of Anastasia, Christian buys the lot (Jose, incidentally, did not ask Anastasia's permission before displaying the pictures - she seems to attract domineering men, as also demonstrated by the attitude of her new boss). Could it be that Christian has fallen in love? It's not all romantic froth, though; the appearance of one of Christian's former submissives reminds the viewer that this is not all nudge-nudge, wink-wink, slap-and-tickle and the scene where she kneels before Christian and he strokes her hair as if she were a cowed labrador is quite chilling.Acting-wise, Johnson does well enough with her shallow, Mills and Boon role; and as Christian becomes more relaxed it is good to see Dornan given the chance to make him more than just the mysterious billionaire he was in the first film. But it is the supporting roles that are the most noticeable: singer Rita Ora, as Christian's 'full-on' sister, acquits herself very well - someone give her a larger role! - and Kim Basinger channels every 80s US soap queen you can think of in her role as the woman who was the teenaged Christian's dominatrix. Bella Heathcote, gifted the part of Christian's damaged former submissive, makes the most of the film's only real dramatic role.Like its predecessor, 'Fifty Shades Darker' is ultimately a lifestyle film: everything looks really attractive, from Johnson and Dornan's impressively-toned bodies, to the elegant clothes and the lavish houses and apartments. And the sex? Well, in contrast to Sam Taylor hyphen Johnson's efforts on the first film, *this* film's director, James Foley, inputs a little more adventurism into the sex scenes, although viewers will be pleased to note that safe sex appears to be practiced: Dornan doesn't even remove his trousers for most of the bedroom antics!",

            "content": "Nothing about the way this film is written is even remotely believable and there is no arguing that. Nothing about this film makes any sense. Fifty Shades Darker is a film that is much more formulaic than its predecessor in the most fanfiction way possible. The first film, while difficult to sit through in its own way was, at least, structured like a film- like there were writers behind the scenes trying to piece together a semi-coherent film out of questionably written erotic fanfiction. This film moves away in that and opts, instead, to go for a very repetitive story cycle which never really goes resolved and recycles every conflict every time for the duration of the film. Half way through it might leave you thinking it's the end when you still have over an hour more of the same thing to sit through.To be brutally honest, this film almost feels like Caligula in that the story, characters, and plot all serve as a means to an end, and that being the sex scenes. The difference between them comes, however, where Caligula aimed to shock (for better or for worse) Fifty Shades Darker does as predictably as the rest of the film and delivers more of the same. There is nothing memorable about any aspect of this film- it seems only to serve as the jumping point for the series' conclusion and nothing more. It attempts to set the stage for the sequel without having any real identity of its own. The first film ended on a cliffhanger but that goes resolved almost immediately as this film starts- and what's worse is that it insults you by trying to make it look like that isn't the case when, in reality, it isn't fooling anyone. There is no conflict in the character, she's not strong, she is willing to submit to the nightmare of her life as soon as the smallest challenge to her will arises.I've probably played up my distaste for this film in this review but in reality it isn't any worse than the first film, it just managed to find different ways to get to that level of quality. The last straw for me in this film was the whole helicopter crash sequence as it is so cliche of a teenage fanfiction it bordered on unbearable. Despite all that, however, it seems to speak to a lot of people, at least to some degree. If you're curious about what this film is like, like I was, it won't hurt to give it a watch- even if it does take multiple sittings. Don't expect any more of it than the last film offered though, that is a recipe for unfathomable disappointment. This film is its own thing so take it one story cycle at a time and roll with it.",

I saw the first movie in theaters and was totally disappointed but the trailer for this movie made me think it was going to be better. It wasn't. The scenery was beautiful and the soundtrack was great but the acting and story line were total crap. Scenes that are supposed to be totally intense are monotone and boring. This story is supposed to be filled with emotion. It's supposed to have screaming and yelling, fighting and making up. It's supposed to be intense. Instead all you get are a ton of scenes with boobs and the actor supposedly having sex with his pants on. People like this story because it's a bit kinky but it's still a story that needs to be told. I felt they left out pretty much everything that makes this story likable and what was left barely made sense. If you haven't read the books you most likely won't know what's going on. Just for reference the theater was mostly empty. Maybe 20 people watching on opening weekend Saturday night. Several people kept checking their phones and one lady was asleep when the lights came on at the end. They fooled my twice. I won't be back to see any future movies from this story line. I'm sad that they screwed this story up so badly.",

The first movie was better: an innocent girl getting seduced (up to a point) by a handsome and powerful man who is into S&M. In this second installment, the sex scenes are sensual rather than erotic and to people who think this movie promotes abuse of women: there is very little in this movie that can be considered as such; the only guy that is abusive is Anastasia's boss and if anything, this movie shows it as an example of how NOT to treat women.The two main actors are both pleasant eye candy, more so Dakota Johnson, but maybe that's just from my male perspective. Dakota also gives a slightly better acting performance but I didn't sense sufficient chemistry between the two of them. The plot is almost non-existent; there is absolutely no suspense or build-up of any kind. If there were no sex scenes, this would seriously be the worst movie ever. And if they left only the sex scenes and took away everything else, it would be the worst soft-porn movie ever. As it stands, it is sort of a stylish visualization for fans of the book.",

Not at all what someone would expect Anastacia to be. However, there is a certain likability factor about her too.I liked the sets and enjoyed the glamour. I also felt the producers/directors did as much as they could with such a poor script about a virgin with a freaky billionaire boyfriend. In that respect, it didn't stray too far from the original novel, which was excruciatingly boring.There were several different story lines happening as well as numerous villains - which was just plain old weird. One might think it would make the movie more interesting, but alas, it did not. It was just more unnecessary fodder.Was it better than the first one? That's hard to say. I saw the first one two years ago and I remember coming away with a similar disappointed, bored feeling as I have right now. But that's about all I remember of that - it's not exactly the sort of franchise that stands out in your memory.50 Shades is worth seeing on video, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",

Tt's important to mention that the first movie is the most financially successful erotic-drama of all time with more than 500 million dollars at the box office (out of a small Hollywood budget of 40 million$). Dakota Johnson is a very fine actress, she is really lovely in this franchise, and the lead actor is very good as well. We can definitely feel the chemistry between them.The story keep focusing on their weird relationship, it is really a continuation of the first movie. The film is funny, sexy and well hmm...erotic.

These scenes attempted to make it exciting but they lead to nowhere. Everyone knows it's the sex that is the selling point here. And it really shows with all the actors looking really bored or wooden because they are really struggling with an unbelievably bad script. Being a sequel, there were the erotic scenes copied from the first movie - Christian picking up Ana to carry over his shoulder; Christian exercising while Ana looks on and biting her lip. It's that catatonically bad that it has to borrow from the predecessor.The sex scenes were also comedic. Sam Taylor Johnson in the first 50 Shades made it more artistic and feminist. This time however, it is more like a porn movie by James Foley. His close up of Ana's naked body leaves nothing to the imagination. Ana's constant sighing and heavy breathing are overdone and distracting.It's not surprising this movie is worse than the first one despite a higher IMDb score. I dare not think what the next installment will be like. It will probably be split into two to make even more money. Sex definitely sells and EL James and associates are laughing all the way to the bank.",

            "content": "Let me begin this movie review by first explaining how I came to find myself seated before this total Hollywood double dumpster fire titled \"Fifty Shades Darker\". Believe it or not I happened to be on a date with an exceptionally beautiful woman, who evidently beyond being beautiful was a very sweet talker because as soon as we finished dinner she suggested we take in a movie. Sitting in a darkened room beside this rather impressive female specimen sounded like a great idea to me so I agreed. I should acknowledge prior to this review I did not see the first movie 50 Shades of Grey of which this was a sequel. I do recall hearing a lot of discussion around the book and first movie- but by some act of God's grace I had slipped through these first two waves of certain epic disaster on page and film. Thank you Baby Jesus. However as my date and I, we will call her \"Tiffany\" studied the marquee it quickly became apparent we had two choices for our time slot.. Grey, or some movie about robot super heroes in another dimension. I attempted to romanticize how there are incalculable dimensions and states as theorized in quantum physics and the exciting and evolving new field of quantum computing. Whereas traditional computing operates on a binary system of 1 and 0, either \"on\" or \"off\" as the computing code but in quantum computing it is understood that infinite possibilities exist between \"off\" and \"on\" at any given moment in time, resulting in tons of possibilities in the same computing space. To which Tiffany replied to me and the now enthralled ticket clerk- \"Two for 50 shades darker please!\". So there I sat in the theater as the opening scene of 50 shades darker unfolds\u0085 the heroine (Ana?) of the story is apparently a receptionist/assistant to the boss of some sort of business, I think publishing, but I never could figure out exactly what type of business\u0085 which was indicative of this movie as a whole\u2014 completely, utterly plot less. Looking for a plot in this movie was about as fruitful for me as OJ looking for the real killer(s). Anyway in the opening scenes she seems to have somewhat of a normal job and upon arriving home from work finds a huge bouquet of flowers from Mr. Grey. Evidently Mr. Grey must have committed some wrongs in the previous movie and the flowers were for atonement and reconciliation. As it turns out Grey (27) who has the physique of an Olympic athlete also happens to be a multi-billionaire. So obviously the flowers worked for him and he was back in like Flynn. He mentioned some promise of fewer rules and punishments but it didn't matter. We are never told how Grey got in such good physical condition nor how he happened upon 10 billion dollars, he is never seen doing any physical work and in only one scene did he seem to have some sort of job. But alas almost nothing in this movie was \"believable\"- Not the least of which was- Why would a billionaire fall in love with this Ana chick? (she seemed to be absolutely the most boring woman on earth)It was at this time that I made my first trip to the refreshment counter, where a few teenage boys were scooping popcorn and slinging Twizzlers. I stood there, alone in a daze just watching them work. Finally one of them realizing what was happening said \"Your stuck here on a date in the 50 shades movie Huh?\" I nodded my head. \"How much longer do I have, I asked?\" \"Oh it's only been about 12 minutes, you have plenty to go!\" They got a good laugh as I schlepped back into the theater. Upon returning to my seat I found Tiffany completely captivated in the movie, she was hanging on every word. \"Thank goodness you made it back, they are about to attend a dinner ball\" said Tiffany. \"Swell\" I replied. The \"dinner ball\" turned out to be a masquerade ball (huge plot twist) which excited Tiffany even further. It was at this moment where I began to practice a secret technique which has been practiced by masters and passed down for generations. It takes great practice but basically the master detaches from the material world, first by shifting the mind to a steady state very similar to what an out of body experience would be. Where the mind becomes more of an observer of emotions and simply lets them pass by. I realized that only through the practice of higher functioning techniques would I ever hope to continue to endure the awful acting, story line and total pointlessness of the situation. This same technique and skill set would prove beneficial should you ever find yourself being water boarded, subjected to electric- shock torture or on extended visits with your in-laws. I was abruptly aroused from a state of near nirvana as Tiffany grabbed my arm in shock at what was occurring on the screen. I am not sure how much time had passed since the masquerade ball scene but apparently Mr. Grey was in a steep nose dive in one of his helicopters. To which my first thought was Thank you Baby Jesus this movie is about to be over! I watched with glee as the craft plummeted straight down into the tall timber of the Pacific Northwest. But\u0085 yep you guessed it, our billionaire came out with a slight abrasion on the forehead. I don't really remember how the movie ended, I just remember holding back tears of joy as the first credits began to roll up the screen. In short\u0085 do everything within your power to avoid this movie.",

How, I really don't know. I actually read the books and I get it why they may appeal to the masochists because they are torture to get through. At least they are fun to read in company and just laugh out loud. But alright, I'm not talking about the books here, I'm talking about the movie.I didn't you know just straight out hate the first one. I didn't find it awful, just kinda lame. It had a nice soundtrack (just like this one), nice cinematography and there was some effort put into it to make it better than the books. And same here. They actually improved a little over the book. And they actually put some effort into it and I appreciate they at least tried. But they didn't really manage to make something good. But is that really possible? I think they probably did this the best way they could while also servicing fans. And yeah, it's not very good. This one is more plot driven than the first one, which was all about sex. And those sex scenes were pretty tame. They are tame here too, don't expect to get very turned on while watching this movie, because you won't. They are not poorly shot or anything, and songs add quite a lot to the atmosphere. But still, don't expect very explicit sex scenes. It's all pretty much soft- core. They even feel like today's music videos. The one near the end got the closest to actually feeling erotic.The actors are doing the best they can with what they are given, but there isn't much chemistry between them. If you are a fan, I guess you'll feel it, but the \"emotional\" scenes will do nothing for the rest. Now, the plot. Compared to the books, they tried to fix the plot as much as they could and I appreciate that. The plot in the book was all over the place. So many plot points introduced and abandoned or ended too quickly. And some parts just plain unnecessary. Here they mixed up the order of the events, so it feels a bit more like an actual plot. Some things were wiped out and for a good reason. And they made the characters more likable. In the book, they are awful. Anastasia is whiny and Christian is a sociopath. Words can't describe how much I couldn't stand the characters in the book. Movie Christian is a damaged, troubled man, but book Christian is just a mean, controlling jerk who is obviously mentally ill. That's one more thing they improved from the books. The pacing could be a bit better, but it wasn't a disaster. At some times things seemed to happen too slow and sometimes too fast, but it was bearable.All in all, it's a slight improvement over the first one which is still something considering the second book was even worse than the first one. I appreciate that they tried to make this as good as possible, but it's still not enough to make this a memorable experience.",

            "content": "(Sigh).\nOh god, where to begin with this one?Let me start off by saying that the first 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' (2015) wasn't actually all that bad, it wasn't exactly good, not by any stretch of the imagination, but it wasn't the repugnant mess that some, if not most, of us expected it to be.\nWeak and uninspiring maybe, but nevertheless a respectable enough adaptation of respectably mediocre source material. So what about the much anticipated (or indeed, dreaded, depending on your particular viewpoint) sequel? Is it a step up, more of the same, or a step down?\nWell, let's just say it's certainly not a step up. Though it would be safe to assume that for huge fans of the first, it's successor will prove satisfactory. For the rest of us, however, not so much.If the first film served as nothing more than a two-hour trailer for the second, then the second film serves as nothing more than insipid, tedious filler, preparing us for the third. The story, or at least what masquerades as a story, picks up from the previous film.Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) and Christian (Jamie Dornan) are still separated and in order to win her back, Christian has resorted to turning stalker, pestering her with unwanted gifts and following her to art galleries until she submits to his perturbing charms. If this kind of behaviour is what is now considered desirable then Max Cady must be quite the ladies man...What follows is a series of uninteresting characters placed in uninteresting situations that I won't go into detail on. Those of you who have read the books will already know and those of you who haven't aren't really going to care.The leads themselves are thoroughly unlikable human beings, and their respective performances so hollow and wooden that Pinocchio himself looks every inch the real boy he always hoped he would be, in comparison.No doubt the film is going to illicit some visible cringing and nervous giggles among it's viewers, though not for the reasons you may have expected. No, it's not the provocative sex scenes that prompt this reaction, it's the dialogue. With more cheesy one-liners than a Top Gun reunion, it's almost unfathomable that upon reading the script the actors didn't immediately remove their names from the project. But fair play to them, they persevered and provided us with some much needed comic relief, the fact that it's unintentional is inconsequential as it's by far the most enjoyable part of the film.One shining example comes near the start of the film when Christian enters a restaurant only to find Anastasia engaged in conversation with her employer, Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson). Christian confidently swaggers on over and introduces himself:\"I'm the boyfriend.\"\nJack's reply: \"Yeah, I'm the boss!\"\nHear that sound? No, that's not applause, that's the sound of synchronised face-palming from every member of the audience.It's not quite Woody Allen is it, with some lines even bordering on the ridiculous: \"I was trying to be romantic, but then you distract me with your kinky f**kery!\". Yep, I don't know what that means either...It's hard to tell if this is in fact a serious attempt at an adult-orientated drama or just an 'Airplane'-style parody of other, superior efforts. And if this is the case, then it's surely an underappreciated masterpiece, a dead-pan triumph and a true great of the comedy genre that can rightly take it's place among the likes of 'Blazing Saddles' (1974) and 'The Life Of Brian' (1979). If not, well then it's just plain awful.In fact, it's quite possible to assume that even the film's subject audience may well have had enough after this abysmal attempt, but there is no doubt that despite it's universal hatred and lambasting from critics everywhere that this tripe is going to make a lot of money and thusly, we will most certainly be subjected to a third.However, aside from it's unintentional hilarity and loathsome characters, above all it's main stumbling point is the fact that it's just rather, well, dull...\nWe anxiously linger on the edge of our seats waiting for something interesting to transpire, only to slump back down in disappointment when it doesn't.The problem is that it can't decide if it wants to be a softcore porn film in the vein of Tinto Brass or a 'Hollyoaks'-esque teen soap opera. Unfortunately in the end it falls short of both.\nIn fact, it's so over-dramatic and cliched that as the screen fades to black and the end credits roll, you just can't help but envisage the famous 'Eastenders' theme tune playing over the top.It so desperately wants to be cutting-edge and risqu\u00e9, but it's flaccid attempts at gasp-inducing raunchiness just come across as laughable, especially when it's been done so much better, so many times before. One particular example would be Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 masterwork 'Last Tango In Paris', which not only puts Fifty Shades to shame in terms of sexual content, but also has the artistic merit and depth to back it up.It's amazing how much sex still sells, particularly when we live in a world with a library of free internet pornography at our fingertips, so if you're that desperate to see some action, just stay at home with your wi-fi and save your hard-earned money. And for the romanticists among you, just buy your spouse some flowers and chocolate for Valentines Day, please don't subject them to this perverse form of punishment. Surely they haven't done anything bad enough to warrant this kind of treatment...The best analogy I can use to sum up 'Fifty Shades Darker' would be to reference a scene from the television series 'Jackass', aptly titled: The Omelette. Those of you old enough, (or juvenile enough, depending on how you see it), to have seen the show will know exactly what I'm referring to. But for those of you who do not, I shall explain, though I warn you, those of you of a weak disposition may want to cease reading any further.What happens is this: Jackass member Dave England eats the ingredients to a delicious omelette one by one before proceeding to vomit it back up into a frying pan, cook it and eat it again. Now, in essence, that's what this film is, a blend of perfectly acceptable ingredients, that taken on their own are fulfilling and satisfactory enough, however when blended together and regurgitated back up, the ensuing mess is not very appealing to say the least.\nBut nevertheless the movie-going public will happily flock to 'Fifty Shades Darker' in droves to gladly and gleefully gobble down this unappetising muck, the rest of us however, force-fed the junk will be left more than a little nauseated, with a rather unpleasant and bitter taste in our mouths.",

            "content": "Robbie K here, and I'm back to bring you yet another movie review on the latest movie theater \"hits.\" No doubt that many are ready for the mass advertised Fifty Shades Darker, the sequel to the literary work that \"graced\" the world so long ago. Despite how badly the first installment did, Hollywood is taking another shot at the series. Is this thing up to the test? Or is it just a plain, dirty dream filling, mess. As always, I'm going to do my best to put bias aside (unlike some reviews) and give you some insight into this flick. Let's go LIKES \u0095 Still Tasteful\u0085mostly \u0095 Story a little better \u0095 Surprisingly funny at time \u0095 Soundtrack Still KickingSummary: While I'm not the biggest fan of the Fifty Shades series, this reviewer has to recognize the pressure placed on the directors for this series. For me, I think they did a nice job keeping the movie tasteful while indulging in some of the\u0085sexier qualities of the film. Although supposedly darker, the movie keeps most of the steamy scenes in decent detail without crossing into porn threshold, except the last scene\u0085nothing tasteful about that. But when the actors aren't trying to sell the sex, the story that tries to give it purpose starts to emerge. While certainly not the strongest story, Fifty Shades Darker is a little more dynamic, bringing some mystery, some drama, and some love to the table. Those who wanted a little more details to the cast will get their wish, somewhat, and wetting your appetite for the next film. Amidst all the dramatic moments though are some well-timed comedic moments, often pointing out the ridiculous concepts housed in this series. Yet the best thing, for me at least, was the soundtrack. Once more the music editors have selected/crafted tracks that fit well into the scenes, including a number of songs that will capture the heat of the scene. Was it as good as the first installment? I don't think so, but it still does its job. DISLIKES: \u0095 Story is still lacking \u0095 No butts about it \u0095 Extra Characters Lacking \u0095 Character Development Simplistic \u0095 Acting still needs improvementSummary: Okay, I'm not ignorant enough to not recognize that a lot of people are going for the \"passionate\" moments. But a reviewer looks at the other qualities, including the story. Despite being better and having more components to it, Darker's story is still lacking. Many of the plots promised in the trailer are simplistic at best, often dropping them for another sex scene or sequence of the couple arguing. The mysterious girl, the blonde dominatrix, and many other tales involving other characters are diluted attempts to add suspense, adding a little suspense and foreshadowing for the next installment before the potential is dropped. In fact, the only thing really developed to me was the origins of the strange obsession with domination and sadism. As mentioned earlier, the character development is stronger in this film, but it too didn't live up to the potential it could have. While their sex life was reaching a climax, their backstories barely moved from baseline, other than a few flashes of sad origins and some insight explaining their approach to love. For many this won't be an issue, because it gives some more time for spicy antics, overdramatic quarrels, and plenty of butt and breast shots for audiences to absorb. Yes, you get plenty of the eye candy in this film, which helps cover up the work in progress acting. If I'm not mistaken, both leading roles are awkward, reserved, and have some traumatic history. However, this does not provide an excuse for sloppy line delivering, creepy staring, and using grunts and sighs as space fillers. I wasn't the most thrilled with either leads' performance in the movie, outside of being able to do it on the screen (they seem to have that down pat). The VERDICT:Overall Fifty Shades Darker delivers what was promised, steamy scenes interlaced with the romantic drama that is enjoyed by so many. I think it still held some taste, mixing the sex with a story that provides the entertainment most will be looking for. Can it match to the picture your imagination patient when reading? No, because Hollywood doesn't have an unlimited budget and has rules to abide. But it does its best to provide what many craved. Yet not even sex can make up for the limitations in acting, detailed story, and character development that goes beneath the skin. I'm sure my review will not stop fans from trekking to the theater, but this reviewer can't recommend this one for the theater, unless you just want to see the sex on a massive screen. Yet, it also doesn't deserve the worst score, because it delivers what I think it promises, though not all the way. Oh, and make sure to stay for the credits for a teaser that really is a tease. My scores are: Drama/Romance: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0",

Like you had already decided to hate the movie in advance (or rated it without even seeing it like some here on IMDb even writes they have done!)I really enjoyed the books, and maybe it will help a lot having read the books (and understood where Christian Grey is from in his upbringing), but still I cannot see how such a complete movie can be reviewed so bad by someone actually contemplating what they have just seen, fairly. A could understand a 4-5 for sure if you disliked the movie, but 1/10 is so clearly just because of hate for the genre and the success of the franchise. The movie follows the book closely, and although the sex scenes do not take up much of the movie, there are plenty of them as must be expected. What they show is the kind of kinky sex described in the book, but without any explicit sex scenes, that has not already appeared in many other movies. But they show what that very important part of their relationship is, and that it is more than just \"vanilla\" sex, something not so often shown in other films.But also the emotional scenes in the movies are very strong, especially when Christian again fears he will be loosing Anastasia and goes completely blank on the floor in front of her.And there are plenty of action with a bad guy going after both of the main characters, a crazy ex-sub and Mrs. Robinson perfectly personified by Bassinger.Maybe it is because I felt the reviews have been unfair, that I have given it a 10 rather than a 9? But I just had a great experience watching the movie in the cinema with my wife, and would have hated missing it because I had listened to the hateful reviews.So if you enjoyed the books, then forget all these negative reviews and go watch a great movie.

Fifty Shades Darker is missing the heart, beauty, and delicacy of Fifty Shades of Grey. The gorgeous settings of Grey are gone. The decor of Christian's apartment and office went from worthy of Architectural Digest to being inspired by ManCave.com via Pinterest. One look and you know the colors were all chosen by men.There is no psychological understanding of the characters and their emotional and sexual needs. That lack of understanding applies to minor characters as well. What motivates Elena? How does Grace go from introducing Elena as her great friend to slapping her without the slightest psychological turmoil? The main problem is the determination of the director and writer to careen into the next plot point. Those plot points are either clich\u00e9d or unbelievable. Tellingly, the plot point of the book that would have increased our understanding of Christian--his getting counseling--was left out. It's an action film about sex. Without a slow build-up, the sex is more acrobatic but not as sexy. I didn't hate the movie. Dornan and Johnson are great within the confines of what they've been given to work with. The movie is redeemed by the pretty bodies and faces and by our understanding of the characters from Fifty Shades of Grey.

There's a bunch of other stuff that happens like how he becomes her boss and their family and exes get in their way. This movie was so boring I just found myself trying to think of anything else. I realize I'm extremely critical of movies that are flat out boring. I said that \"Caligula\" would be the only porn movie I ever saw in my life and I think I broke that rule.This film has four sex scenes in it. I don't know if there's some kind of rule that a film has to have a certain amount of nudity to be considered a porn film. This probably does qualify and it's as trashy as any other porn film. The movie shows no graphic depiction of genitalia. Could they even get away with that in an R-rated film? They know that rating a movie NC-17 is the absolute guarantee your film will fail. Should they have gone all the way? It's all rather pointless.I guess I'll make an exception for not reviewing porn if it happens to be very well distributed or is something you would see in a movie guide. The only time I actually noticed something going on was when a gunshot occurred. The original was based on a Twilight fanfic and I don't know if there was a sequel made that was film was based on. Okay, when the fic was adapted into a book, they probably make a book sequel. Can't we get stuff based on good fanfics? Look up \"Harry Potter And The Methods Of Rationality\" for something good.

Note to director, this movie is for adults not children.For the longest time now, I would argue since around 2005, the American movie industry, perpetuated by mostly American female actors, have been evoking a near radical Christian view of sex and nudity. So, directors, even when they are paid to produce such content like this film, are not able to really liberate themselves, or allow themselves to push some boundaries even when it's supposed to. They just don't even know what that means anymore. And when they attempt it it's always so artificial, contrived and silly, again, such as this film. At least the first director in the film film showed off Johnson's beauty and body. This guy seemed to want to avoid that.It seems American filmmakers feel an innate duty to hold back and editing is the tool in which directors and editors communicate their silly fear of it all. Eg, how they can shoot a beautiful actor walking across a room nude but they instinctively tell themselves, oh, that's too revealing, have to cut that way down, show as little as possible. But yes, pull her hair!, slam her around!, grind on her! But no frontal nude shots, because, that's not sex. This is the new American directors mindset. Where in other countries it's the opposite, a lack of fear and a desire to show the body over artificial explicitness.In the end, this movie is more like an annoying MTV music video than it is an erotic story. The music over the sex is so annoying and childish. And rather than natural sensuality and beautiful naked bodies we get this absurd hyper-stylized depiction of sex where people work too hard to make it \"seem\" explicit.",

BUT because he is unimaginably wealthy, physically attractive, and f**ks well ... eh ... who cares... Ana loves him. The guy is a psychopath: he buys the company where she works because her boss is attracted to her, he knows her bank account (why??), and he keeps a file on her. Come on people, the guy is 2 hairs short of being a freaking serial killer. In what bizarro land is any of this romantic?!? Hot?!? Sexy?!?Let's not even delve into how poorly and shallowly the Dom/Sub relationship is portrayed. Let's skip over the obvious ignorance of the author in their understanding and personal experience of BDSM. Let's ignore the naivet\u00e9 it would take to pair an abusive childhood with fetishism and pigeonholing sex where anything outside your basic missionary position is the realm of the deviant and disturbed. \"Only tortured children grow up to enjoy bondage.\" Yes, please, let's keep running that narrative.

Her \"friend\" photographs her then displays the prints in galleries without her permission intending to sell the photos to strangers (gross).

And her boyfriend keeps a freaking file on her, breaks into her house, tries to forbid her from seeing other men, tries to keep her from working, and hires people to find out every personal thing about her and everyone around her ... oh but she LIKES him so that makes it all OK. Come on people this is just sick!Ana is constantly needing to be rescued. Anything she achieves is because someone else notices her not because she goes after anything. She's annoyingly mousy, indecisive, and plays little girl ... oh but don't tell her what to do ... because she's not a sub. She tells Christian to spank her so she's totally in control of the relationship ... except that he's manipulating and controlling her the entire time.

Plus she just rips off the line from Working Girl ... did she know she did that because it seems like she just tried to pass it off as her own. And the rest of the film is like some horrible porn flick with incoherent scenes jumping to more incoherent scenes with excuses for sex scattered every 10 minutes or so just so you're reminded that this is supposed to be hot. There's no cohesion to any of it. There's random gutter girl ... Kim Basinger is Christian's Mrs. Robinson ... a helicopter crashes ... god it's a mess. And on top of ALL of that ... the sex scenes were awful. I thought that was supposed to be the pull of these movies?Please say there won't be a third one of these!",

            "content": "I have read all the books. Twice. America is too conservative for this film. I agree the movie is 'soft porn' to those who like to hide the fact that they sometimes have 'nasty sex'. Everybody has sex, it's human nature. America is throwing a childish tantrum and being hypocritical in it's reception of this movie. That being said, here is my take: Calm the f*ck down. Making a choice to watch this movie is clearly yours alone, if your money feels wasted, then no use crying over spilled milk. I love how unapologetic they were in this one. ALL THE SEX scenes were tastefully done, this movie can not have a story-line without sex. The books are less tame than the movie. Even though it brings a light to certain sexual notions of BDSM, it remains a rated-18 film for only adults to watch. Adults that can't be swayed easily by what they watch, except dumb Americans (in general). Europeans watched this for the entertainment, and the 'love' feel, which the actors did a good job of portraying. I will watch this again because it feeds the pictures i have in my head while reading the novels. The novels do a much better job however. Such judgmental reception of a movie skews quality critique when the only thing people are worried about is their personal feelings when it comes to associating with a potential significant other. It says more about the viewer than the acting or directing.They did way better in this than the first one. I personally felt Christian and Elliot were too skinny in the first one, but they bulked up. All the actors did good. Mia is my only issue, she is supposed to be way curvier, but oh well, I can live with that. Christian is supposed to be more affectionate with Mia; affectionate enough for Ana to notice how different he acts around her. That is one character development that would have added dimension to his character; made him at least a tad redeemable in the eyes of unnecessarily harsh American critique. If it was Brad Pitt... he'd get a better reception, probably outright acceptance. They almost doubled their money, so that means people are watching but no one wants to admit that they watched it, or liked it.Watch this as a guilty pleasure. It may not be true BDSM, but then again it is FICTIONAL. (except your brain can't grasp the meaning of the word).",

This is a LOVE story.For those who have NOT read the novels and/or misunderstood the story here is a correction. This story is NOT ABOUT THE ABUSE OF A WOMAN.Anastasia Steele is the one in Charge. she is much smarter than Christian Grey from the get-go. ANA makes ALL of the decisions about SEX. It is SHE who controls what Christian does to her. If she says NO, he cannot go further: EXAMPLE: at the end of 50 Shades it is ANA who asks to be shown how rough Christian can get. At any time during the 6 strikes of the belt - she could have used her SAFEWORD: RED.She choose NOT TO to have a COMPLETE understanding of how bad Christian's actions were.In that story it is ANA who tells Christian that she wants him. In this story (very poorly re-imagined by the screenwriter) Ana is ALWAYS the one who wants to be ADVENTURSOME.and this is NOT a tale of BDSM. BONDAGE/DOMINATION/SADOMACHISMChristian is damaged from his childhood interactions with his mother's PIMP. He takes those same actions himself: hitting with a belt, tied up, etc.So it is his inner troubled soul seeking LOVE in the ONLY way he has ever know. His mother ignored him and let the pimp beat him; his step mother is a busy doctor and probably had little time for him and showed little love. \"Mrs. Robinson\" introduced him to his lifestyle by slapping him hard, then f--king him.He grows up, goes to BDSM clubs around Seattle and picks up girls who are into that thing.He only uses Bondage (to keep anyone from touching him) and Domination to control the girls whom he f--ks.The contract (from book 1) specifically excludes ALL of the ROUGH, INHUMANE, AND DISTASTEFUL ACTIONS such as dealing with bodily fluids or other substances, blood, and includes IMMEDIATE CESSATION of actions at the GIRLS request.Ana is in LOVE with Christian and takes on the immense challenge of bringing Christian to adulthood. (he is stuck in a kind of pubescent sexual lifestyle.) The movie script is such a BAD version of the novel that at times it becomes humorless and uninteresting. There is NONE of the fierce passion and drama bursting from the screen that is so well written by the author. They should have kept the original director: Sam Taylor-Johnson - she understood the story and brought it faithfully to the screen.",

This one starts pretty much after the last one ended. Dakota is now working at a job publishing books, instead of selling them. Jamie shows up professing his love for her and telling her that he will do anything to get her back, even if it is on her terms. You know, maybe a little less S&M in the red room. She tells him they will try and take things slow & easy. Yeah, right. It's not long before they are going at each other as if they were in a soft porn movie. Eric plays Dakota's boss at her new job and I have never read the books but I have a feeling that Eric will play a bigger part in Chapter 3, due out in theaters around Valentines' Day 2018. There are some females that show up from Jamie's past; one is an ex submissive that has gone a little psycho and the other is the 'Mrs Robinson' that taught Jamie a thing or two in the bedroom-Mrs Robinson is played by Kim. Marcia plays Jamie's stepmother. Oh yeah, there is a helicopter crash which causes matters to escalate. If you liked the first one then you should like this one, too. I thought it was a little better than the first one. When the end credits start, don't get up and leave just yet. There is a teaser trailer for the 2018 'Fifty Shades Freed', the third installment. It's rated \"R\" for language and strong erotic sexual content-including graphic nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was enough-but it would be alright as a rental.",

            "content": "This movie was hilarious at times, even more than the first one. It must be the element of suspense that was added which in terms of plot development fell short. The thing that is actually on point is the cinematography. The film is well shot, providing some nice scenes and the flow is good. For some reason the first one was better. I think it has to do with the over-hype that surrounded its release but i believe it was more coherent and more decent as a result. Also the soundtrack music was infinitely better. The sequel's OST is atrocious. Every single song was cringe-worthy bubblegum pop that ruined whatever mood they tried to set in, particularly in the sex scenes. There was zero eroticism in the sex scenes. They were rushed, watered down, and even boring for a so called \"erotic book\" adaptation. Ironically Christian encourages Ana to come but of course it ends before we can have a glimpse of her orgasm. The silver balls scene provides so much laughter it's hard to dismiss that one, though. The plot is laughable as a whole. We have 3 \"villains\" who are as menacing as a piece of broccoli and they offer nothing but pointless drama. The whole thing is more of a soap opera than a thriller. Christian's past isn't developed enough to make the audience to care and Ana is just too passive and compliant. When she attempts to stand up for herself Christian shuts her up with a kiss or with a fancy present. He's always overbearing, controlling, and pretty much wants her to be mute and obedient. He does a ton of offensive things that would require a restraining order but all is well when we proposes to her or takes her out to sailing. The romance is as flat as an ironing board and the actors don't do anything to convince us that these two love each other. The biggest fail of this movie was the helicopter scene. Christian's family looked like they were kinda relieved he went missing and the heart-stopping suspense lasts for one scene until Christian casually walks into his apartment with blood on his forehead like some superhero who miraculously crawled out of the crushed helicopter and arrived in Seattle two hours later unharmed. Lol. The final scene features Ana's boss who looks like a homeless junkie and sets up the story-line for the final movie in which he'll be the main villain. Overall if you try to look for interesting characters and situations you'll find none here. This is a film made just for laughter and nothing else. If you want quality you will be disappointed.",

Kim Basinger should have been in it more...you have a diamond like her and show her off for 30secs at the end, tut tut! I was surprised Kim B was in it actually being the star of 9 1/2 weeks and fifty shades being a complete rip off of it, as well as the Secretary of course. There's definitely some other films thrown in there. I think that's where the author got her inspiration, a girls night in with a bottle of red, an ip dip do on chick flicks laced with James Spader and Mickey Rouke...and maybe a secret Santa joke present in the form of a vibrator. Jamie Dornan is an Irish dream boat, he's still developing as an actor but he predominantly carries the film. That's why he has to be so ripped, hes just dragging the whole thing behind him..'come on Dakota, pick up your lip its causing drag, Rita...where are you going? Stop running around in circles and get back here', \"Hi, Ho, Hi Ho\" JamieI think this film restricts his potential and its a shame his interactions with Marcia and Kim couldn't have been longer, as i think we could have seen the dual personality of this potentially good and complex character.

So, what exactly is wrong with this film? Where to even start... the screenwriter, for one, who seems like they just took up writing for fun a few weeks before shooting the film. Some of the lines are absurd - and not even original!!! Look out for a line in the film stolen, verbatim, from Dakota's mom Oscar-winning hit film, \"Working Girl.\" The biggest difference between those two films? Melanie Griffith was Oscar- nominated for her role in \"Working Girl.\" Dakota Johnson will be lucky to get a Razzie award. A high school student who picked up any knowledge of sex or anatomy from science class, or who had any grasp of the English language, could have done a better job writing this script. The new director also seemed in a real hurry to crank this film out-everything is so rushed and confused. Probably the most obvious issue is the acting. Jaime Dornan was good in \"The Fall\" but in this role, he has all the charisma of a cardboard box. He's supposed to be the man of every woman's dreams??? I'd be surprised if after this film franchise wraps he ever manages to land a good role again- in my opinion, this film and this role has pretty much wrecked any chances he'd have of a strong career. Charlie Hunnam is probably thanking his lucky stars he managed to get out of appearing in this wreck! To go from \"Sons of Anarchy\" to this mess of a franchise would have been a huge mistake. Dakota Johnson fares a little bit better than Dornan, but honestly that is not saying much since he is so unappealing in this role. The two also have ZERO chemistry on screen! For a film that's supposed to be some kind of great sexy film, these two actors have absolutely ZERO chemistry. Rather than feel any kind of spark when they were on screen together, I found myself sometimes cringing. Kim Basinger is a good addition to this film, and she is still radiantly beautiful and appealing on screen, but she is given very little to do here. It's too bad that she wasn't the lead- I was more interested in her character than I was in either of the lead characters. Unless you are a huge fan of the books, I'd recommend waiting to watch this on basic cable.",

Though funny at points, and extraordinarily easy to keep up with, the persistent lack of chemistry between the mediocre leads made the film about as raunchy as your grans' knickers.While the franchise has established a rather successful position within the market (having made almost $150m on its' opening weekend alone), the sex-fuelled romance between the very plain Ana (Dakota Johnson) and billionaire bachelor Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) sees demons confronted and emotional deviations from the start.Dornan, while definitely more polished than his previous performance, still lacked energy and relate-ability, while Johnson was an irritatingly deficient component in her reprisal. The remainder of the cast (including an over-hyped Rita Ora) were about as unmemorable as you would expect. The introduction of various faces (Mrs Robinson, unfortunately not portrayed by Kim Cattrall) added nothing exceptional either.The cinematography which, although well-suited to the style of the story, didn't strike me as anything special whatsoever. This time around however, the music was also particularly bland in comparison to Fifty Shades of Grey - which at least complimented the picture.There isn't much to be said for the writing or direction - sex is Darkers' only narrative, which, by the end, borders on ridiculous. It still can't work out if it wants to be a classic love story or a steamy depiction that verges on pornographic - either way their brief has been ineffective.Overall, a middle-of-the-road love story; well-adapted though poorly executed, with occasional steamy moments but hardly tugging at the heart-strings. Boring and bland - I can't wait to be Freed from this trilogy.http://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/",

Honestly, I've read only this part out of sheer curiosity, given that the first one was actually a bit fascinating, albeit a tad unrealistic. Then again, the pleasure that this series has given is always about seeing beautiful people on screen doing things we hoped that in real life could actually happen to us.Continuing straight from the end of the first movie, Ana has moved on with her life and is now working in a publishing company at Seattle. One day, a huge bouquet of white roses was delivered to her house and it's from... you guessed it... Christian. They happened to meet in an art exhibition and he wanted to start over. And this time, no rules, no punishment, and no more secrets. Unfortunately for them, a woman from Christian's past emerged, including his former lover and there's another problem with Ana's new (handsome) boss.Let's just get this out of the way; this movie is a pure guilty pleasure. The story is not that substantial to begin with. It's built as a side attraction to the main event; the sex scenes. And let me tell you, It's more graphic than the first one, it could be considered as porn with a much higher budget. You may think the plot is more dense and that there's going to be so much going on when in fact, there's not much. What I find quite lacking is the dramatic tension. All the conflicts they've brought up in this movie were finished so quickly and without much effort. It's like they're rushing to get to the next sex scene which there are quite aplenty.All that said, the actors are really giving their best. Dakota Johnson, just like in the first one, lights up the screen with her quirky attitude and real vigor. And I found Jamie to be more nuanced in his role here, even though he was given less material to work with than Dakota. The others were game enough but didn't give much impression than the leads.Another thing I have to say is that the screenplay is actually better than its' predecessor, and it's written by the author's husband, Niall Leonard. They actually make it quite funny and intentionally funny (contradictory to the movie title). Yet, any attempt at depth is almost nonexistent. The funny thing is that the book provides more information about Christian's past whereas here it got glossed over with only small glimpses of them.James Foley, who once worked in another erotic movie 'Fear', brought all the glitz and glam to the movie, giving it a very beautiful look. Hell, even the cinematography is so gorgeous, it could pass for an Oscar nomination.All things considered, if you really want to find two hours for an escape from real life, this is your ticket. Don't even expect to get an insight or the bigger meanings of life from watching this movie.",

James as many thought this project was doomed from the very beginning and the bad literary work cannot be turned into a quality film. But I haven't read the book, so who knows. Anyway, Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan return of course playing the central characters and so do some of the others like Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden. But there are also new characters like Kim Basinger's. Yep, another Oscar winner! However, the story is a mess. Let me explain my title now. For huge parts of the film, nothing was happening at all and then they rush in gunpoint scenes, plane crashes, marriage proposals etc. as if there was no tomorrow. Focus and balanced story-telling are completely nonexistent.Overall, the film is not a failure, but equally forgettable as the first. As a heterosexual male, I cannot deny that Johnson is still pretty gorgeous, even if I had some doubts about it in the first half. But sadly, the film is never on par with her looks. It's the same like the first film with the two protagonists trying to establish a relationship that satisfies them both with his desire for domination and her desire for normalcy. And then there are moments when she wants to be dominated and moments when he is normal, so trouble and conflict are simply inevitable. But these scenes are not enough of a foundation to construct a good film on. And the character writing is also disappointing as the ways in which they depict former lovers as evil, potential lovers (the boss) as evil and friends and family as good. Even Mr. Grey has zero shades and the title is a lie. His actions are so predictable for example that he only accepts the men in Ana's life who don't pose a danger from the romantic perspective. Then again, of course she wants nobody other than Grey anyway. The film is a kitschy movie with the only difference to romantic garbage films that it depicts some extremes. But none of it is handled competently and the result is a very bland 130 minutes you don't want to check out. Clearly a thumbs-down from me. Not recommended.",

Personal opinion: 50 shades darker is the first movie that I end up paying $20 to go see & the biggest disappointment ever. Waiting years and it looked like the director didn't even bother to read the books, went short on money and they forgot to hire a writer to finish the script. Plus the actress needs some acting classes or stop acting all together because my God she was like a birth control pill.I personally think that the first one was a much better produced and the chemistry between the character was more realistic. To me in this second movie it was a lack of chemistry and the movie as a hole was not the best for such a high profile movie.",

            "content": "Fifty Shades Darker is much better than Fifty Shades of Grey. The tone is better, the mood is better, the editing is better, acting is better and the chemistry is better. It's not perfect. But it is judged unfairly. It never pretends to be an Oscar movie. It is an average love story. The source material was widely criticized for either promoting abuse of woman, or labeled as being \"mommy porn\". Simply put it is a story written for women by a woman. It is an honest reflection of a character in an unhealthy relationship, with no filters. As a filter obsessed society, we judge when things are without filters, but secretly we crave and embrace the honesty. #NoFilter. Because it was so widely embraced in secret by women, it was labeled as being \"porn\". To make it less, and to make woman feel dirty and pathetic for enjoying it. The story as a whole is a simple love story. A woman falls in love with a man that was deeply scarred as a child. Physically abused by his mothers' boyfriend, abandoned and neglected by his mother. Surviving for 3 days with his mothers corps. Taken in by a loving family. Never dealing with his past, becoming a troubled teenager. Sexually abused and turned into a sadist by an older woman. Heavy stuff. When the only woman that ever saw the real him, runs away in fear. He evolves to win her back(People don't change, they can only evolve). The movie touched on all the topics mentioned above, but in my opinion it wasn't dramatic enough. It never builds, and it kind of falls flat. I have read the books, and I think my expectations were a little high. I expected it to be intense and dramatic, given the subject matter. unfortunately the movie runs horizontal. I would have combined the 2nd and 3rd books. The story line in Darker doesn't have enough substance as a stand alone movie. but having said that it was hot, steamy and sexy. and as a 2nd movie in a trilogy it carries the story forward.",

            "content": "If you can say anything nice about 50 Shades Darker it's that, unlike its odious predecessor, it at least doesn't tack on some faux \"liberated woman\" bulls**t in the feeble hopes of shutting down naysayers. Adding something to that effect at the end of this stinker would have been the equivalent of saying \"don't tinkle in public,\" right after electrocuting yourself on an electric fence, fly first. Also, while we're on the subject of niceties, another good thing about this movie is it ends\u0085eventually.Anastasia Steele (D. Johnson), our milquetoast protagonist from the last film is at it again with her manipulative, controlling, borderline psychotic, billionaire boyfriend, Christian Grey (Dornan). Only this time, the only safety word we're given is \"change\". As in, \"I'm a changed man,\" and/or \"you need to change,\" or (if you ignore the theatrical release and find this garbage on Cinemax) \"change the channel.\" Anastasia is convinced the Christian does desire to be a little less sadistic and does have it in him to change; and if we follow the cues of director David Foley, it seems the movie wants to convince us he can.There's a side plot involving a former \"submissive\" (Heathcote) who was gaslighted by Grey long ago, but for the most part we're stuck in the bloated doldrums of Christian and Anna's airless relationship. Their relationship includes such emotional highlights as: angry text messages, excessive brooding, frustrating secrecy and Christian pulling out all the stops to literally buy his paramour. The film then takes great pains to elevate every tiny independent choice Anastasia makes into some epic act of defiance comparable to Kunta Kinte on the whipping pole. Reality is, it's just a concentrated dose of rich white people problems pureed and injected into the faces of willing audiences like Botox.But of course, this movie is not for me. I'm about as far from the prime demographic as you can get (the prime demo of course being aliens piecing together what exactly happened before the Earth was destroyed). Those interested in seeing the sequel to a film based on a book, based on Twilight fan-fiction, are only interested in one thing. I'll give you a guess as to what that is.Well far be it from me to disagree with the middle-aged women sitting behind me smelling of cheap perfume and Peppermint Schnapps but I really doubt everyone got their money's worth this time around. This movie is not only an insult to fiction publishers, the Seattle skyline, helicopters, the S&M subculture and whatever the f**k Christian Grey actually does for a living, 50 Shades Darker is an insult to good smut. At least good smut gives you the goods. This movie and the filmic atrocity before it gives you the thirty second sample version of what you actually want and fills the rest of the time with blank stares, lacy corsets and complete misunderstanding of human anatomy.The 50 Shades series (2012-Present), despite being horrid in every conceivable way has still managed so far to scrounge enough fans for further movies. To them I ask, would Christian Grey still appeal to you if he had a bank account to match his IQ? Would you still want this character tracing his abs with lipstick then? They say that the difference between erotica and porn is the lighting. I think I would have rather been left in the dark on this series.",

We discover more about Christian in this film as Anna attempts to end his possessiveness and need to control her. Appearing in the film is Bella Heathcote who looks like Anna giving me flashbacks to SWF. Their physical appearance is part of Christian's psyche.The film still suffers as did the first one as neither Dakota Johnson nor Jamie Dornan can act. They were cardboard in their roles. Kim Basinger of \"9 1/2 Weeks\" is suitable for her role as Elena, yet in the film I was bored by her too. I don't know if the characters were this wooden in the book, but they needed to do something for the film.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity",

            "content": "Fifty Shades Darker is the second film in its exotic romantic drama series that is worse than the last movie. Even with the change in writer/director with Niall Leonard and James Foley handling the second installment. The film has a terrible script; direction, and Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan stale performances tend to continue. The plot was eh, if there was one. I will say the soundtrack with the varieties of artists is probably the only positive thing about the movie. The plot continues with Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) trying to get Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) to go back with him. (After things did not end well in the previous movie). Ana now working at a new job with a boss Jack (Eric Johnson) that is trying to flirt with her. Ana decides to give Grey another chance. Soon, Grey's past comes back to haunt after him with Leila (Bella Heathcote) stalking Ana and Christian. If you are into the clich\u00e9 romantic drama movies, than sure this may be for you. Or if you are looking for some steamy erotic sex scenes with Grey's BDSM lifestyle, then this may also be for you. It is difficult to find this film to be any good with its poor plot. Ana is trying to become an independent woman. Trying to have that backbone. When Grey is trying to get her to go back with him, she tells him they need to take it slow. A follow up scene, than shows her caving in for his needs. Which makes this whole movie with Ana trying to have control but a scene later, she and Grey are in bed together. There was no real conflict with this complicated relationship they are having. It tries to have this build up of Grey willing to try to work on himself and his habits for her. But there was no progression on him working it out. Grey is a man that is psychologically damaged after a past with an incident with his mother. The BDSM is his way of escaping his pain, which Elena (Kim Basinger) has showed him in his earlier years. But the plot has no real conflict when it focuses with Ana and Grey going back and forth with trying to take it slow and than rushing into some kinky sex. The script was horrible with some laughable cheesy dialogue. Like \"Kinky F***ery.\" Some made up one-liners that is so bad but laughable. The direction was dull, those steamy sex scenes were made to get a rise out of a certain audience but it was nothing really special about it. The acting was bad with Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. Literally feels like they are bored with their characters. Johnson is a beautiful decent actress but her performance that is so monotone and yet very passive in the movie is irritating and unattractive. The positive aspect of the film, which did not help the movie. It did have a great soundtrack that worked on certain scenes like the \"I don't wanna live forever\" by Zayn and Taylor Swift. And \"Not afraid anymore\" by Halsey. Overall, Fifty Shades Darker is a bad exotic film that is meant to be locked up in a dark room and forgotten. But for the fans of the novels, they may get a kink out of the movie and possibly excited for a third hopefully final movie. I do not recommend the film if your not a fan of the novels.",

Depending on the depiction of possible sex in Romeo and Juliet, the question would arise as to what intent a writer might have.Is the point of 50 shades darker to tell us the story of the pursuit or to show us the 10 (or so) sex scenes while we think we are seeing the story of the romantic pursuit of Miss Steele?In this case, the background drama is tolerable and somewhat OK . . . and there are 10 or so sex scenes which are intriguing and interesting. The sex scenes include semi-public fondling in an elevator, Anna's stimulation by pleasure balls at a masked ball, the use of a leg restraint to flip over Anastasia to set her up for sex and various shots of Anna in lingerie or nude.I think the plot is mostly dumb, at times somewhat irrational, but the sex and nudity was good and fun . . . and that makes the movie worthwhile, that alone.

I found I could tell when episodes were filmed just by looking at the scruff.

Somehow along the way he became a billionaire. He owns many businesses and companies in America and throughout the world. He meets his ex-girlfriend at a photography exhibition where her pictures are on display. He buys all the photographs on display of her in the exhibition. He convinces her to go to dinner with him and after a bit of give and take, she accepts.Christian, the lead character, has had relationships with 2 other women in the past. Kim Basinger and another younger woman. Both women appear to still love Christian a lot and are having a hard time letting Christian go. Anastasia and Christian have a relationship, which leads to moving in together which leads to a marriage proposal which Anastasia accepts. This is the case in point story. On a Meta level, this movie is about abuse and Christian. Christian was abused as a child by his mother and there is a flashback in the movie about his father abusing him too. Christian has cigarette burns on his body and he does not like his torso to be touched, in most cases. He uses his sexual organs as a form of defense mechanism to release his swelling up tensions and stress-levels. According to the 2 ex-girlfriends that pop up in the movie, Christian needs to have a submissive sexual relationship; submissive means in the sexual context but also in the everyday life context. Anastasia appears to desperately want to give this to Christian. This movie has clear female roles and males roles. Christian, the male, takes charge in every way whereas Anastasia is submissive to his needs, for example by not going with her boss on a publications trip to New York. Christian both controls and terrorizes Anastasia's life and Anastasia allows and welcomes this kind of control from him, this is often the Hollywood female role in Hollywood movies. Christian wants to be saved by Anastasia and Anastasia wants to both be the savior and the submissive with a master in her actions with Christian. The relationship that Christian and Anastasia share is a co-dependent relationship; as each person does not seem to be whole and content within their selves. Instead, they need each other to fill the other ones' inner void. In the movie, this concept seems to be both romantic and totally acceptable however in real-life this could possibly lead to disastrous domestic sexual violence. This movie has been rated 18A for adult, and often movies I think should come with an announcement in the beginning of the movie, stating that movie is fiction. It is not-reality, but in fact an art-piece. Sometimes movies can taint reality and paint an unfair picture of what love looks like, so it is advisable to watch this movie through the eyes of an art-critical or film critical versus through the eyes of an audience member who believes this movie reflects our current day society, the roles of men and women in relationship and how love should look like today. As this really is not the case at all. This is a fantasy adult movie. An art flick only.",

Me, being the ever-diligent movie aficionado, decided to go see the movie anyway. And in all honestly, I was looking forward to watching it. When the first trailer surfaced, I was surprised by how good it looked. Incredibly shot with a fantastic music choice, the preview made the movie look more like a thriller than a romance. So on Valentine's Day of 2015 I walked in the theatre, plastic wrap all over the floor like Dexter's kill room, and found myself to be the only single male there. Everyone else in the 300 seat theatre, and I do mean everyone, was either with a date or with a group. Now I'm not sure if you've ever seen a widely released erotic BDSM soft core pornography film in a packed theatre by yourself, but let me tell you that it's not the most comfortable experience, especially when everyone else around you is breathing heavily and leaving every 15 minutes to use the restroom (seriously, those people had the weakest bladders). When the credits rolled not only did I find my shoes somehow soaking wet, but I realized that the movie was actually, well, not bad!I was surprised. This was \"Fifty Shades of Grey?\" This was the movie that users on IMDb rated so low that it had a 3.2 even before it came out? This was the movie Chris Stuckmann gave an \"F\" to and Jeremy Jahns gave his lowest rating of \"dogsh*t\" to? Complex characters filled the screen, an interesting story unfolded before your eyes, and a blossoming romance was born. I'm not ashamed to say I liked \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" so of course I was ready for \"Fifty Shades Darker.\"And of course the critics of the world stomped the movie under their boot. But that wasn't going to stop me from taking my grandma to watch this movie with me. I take film criticism very seriously, and damn it, I'm a sucker for romance (and I know how much grandma loves her bondage). So with all that said, how was \"Fifty Shades Darker?\" The first words that pop into my head are \"sweet,\" \"charming,\" and \"romantic.\" This movie won me over with how sweet its romance was between Anastasia and Christian. Christian, played by Jamie Dornan, is desperately in love with Anastasia, and that comes across very clear. Mr. Dornan's acting is believable and I wouldn't be surprised if the two actors had something going on during filming as well.Dakota Johnson as Anastasia was excellent. I don't want to bash Jamie Dornan's acting ability at all, because he is a fine actor, but Dakota Johnson acts waves across Jamie. Her portrayal of Anastasia Steele is incredible, filled with a shy anxiety and nervous love; she is truly a joy to watch on screen. And man, she is beautiful. I'm telling you, if news broke out that Jamie and Dakota fell in love during the making of this film I wouldn't doubt it.But there isn't just romance in this movie. There are some mild thriller elements here and there and it adds a lot of variety to the film. There are creepy stalkers, misogynistic bosses, and old flames trying to sow discord, and it was all so entertaining to watch. There's a fantastic scene with Christian and one of his old girlfriends that is amazing in its intensity. It will leave you breathless. And speaking of being breathless, let's get to what you really want to read about: the sex scenes. There were a lot more than there were in the first movie, and they were way more graphic, but let's not get carried away. The sexual scenes were filmed with artistry and integrity, and are nothing anyone should be offended by. There were some mild BDSM elements, but it was nothing too crazy, and that brings me to another point. I'm sure you've heard people talk about how the film, and especially the book, doesn't promote a safe BDSM relationship. I've never read the book, so I can't comment on that, but having seen the movie, I can tell you that that's the point. It's not supposed to show you what a safe BDSM relationship looks like, quite the opposite. Christian even says that he's not a dominator, but a sadist. In this film Christian changes. He wants to set his sadistic tendencies aside for Anastasia, because he loves her, because he realizes true love is better than just satisfying his base sexual impulses. It's called character development, and it worked. I can't help but think that people who complained about this didn't watch the second movie or read the second book. Now granted, maybe the book is different, but the film shows a changed, a more complex, and a more complicated Christian Grey.What can I say? I liked the movie. It's not perfect, it has it's fair share of flaws (that I can't write about because of the 1,000 word limit!), but \"Fifty Shades Darker\" is a well filmed and well acted little romance. It has sweetness and charm, and real chemistry between its lead actors. It has scrumptious set and costume design (I mean, Anastasia in that silver dress? Swoon). The ending? Adorable. The cliffhanger? Handled perfectly. The after credits scene? Now I can't wait for the final entry in this trilogy. You've heard the hate, you've heard the controversy, and you've heard the criticism. It's time to make up your own mind. \"Fifty Shades Darker\" may not be the best movie of 2017, but if you like romance, drama, complex characters, and suspense, then it's definitely one you should pay to see. Don't let the hate bandwagon stop you from seeing an enjoyable movie.",

I really like storytelling and I believe there are so many ways to tell a story and I'm okay with both the book and the film. I myself prefer a lot of details and background to the story and characters and that's never rarely ever given to you in a film (that's the part where you have to make it up yourself, or read the book first to get it), and I get that, because if they would, people would think it's slow and boring. I think this was a lot better than the first film, acting wise. I really have to give Jamie Dornan credit, I didn't like his acting in the first film but he really stepped up his game, maybe he got to know the cast and crew better so that he could relax a bit more.

It basically says that if you walk in on your parents having sex, you've been raped and scarred for life. That is stupid. So because this guy walked in on his parents having sex, he has to abuse his girlfriend in order to get it up? I mean, who needs a loving, caring, stable, healthy relationship when you can have glorified rape? The soundtrack is terrible, the acting is terrible, the whole \"Masquerade Ball\" thing reminds me of gross underground human trafficking dungeons, the messages are terrible, the characters are terrible, and the fact that this started as a Twilight fan fiction is kind of speaking for it's quality. And the worst thing is, this setup would have worked if it was a horror movie. But this is a romance that glorifies rape and pokes fun at actual rape victims.

Unfortunately, what we actually get is a long overly melodramatic mess. The biggest offense of the film is the writing. It feels as if the book was used in place of a script. So almost every mundane and useless moment is kept in. And us as the audience suffer because we have to sit through a longer run time with not much happening. Also for a movie that marketed itself on being sexy and taboo, it's quite mild. The most intense they get is a couple of spank scenes that ultimately end in missionary and a cut away to them naked in bed. Because of the terrible writing in the film, the actors don't have much to work with and as a result they give embarrassingly bad performances. Their line delivery feels unnatural and awkward because literally no one talks like that in real life and I feel like the actors realized it, but went along for a fat paycheck. The soundtrack and style isn't bad, but with so much nonsense going on around, they do nothing to make the experience enjoyable, instead I was thinking about which songs I can add to my playlist. In short, \"Fifty Shades Darker\" is a long drawn out melodramatic soap opera that managed to become a feature length film that takes itself too seriously. It has nothing of substance and you can actually find sexier things on television. I give it 2/5",

Books are not complex and the adventurous part is kinda missing. Thus, THIS MOVIE, tried to make the best of it, with some errors, though. 1. It did create emotion and it was sexy. Ana was sexy!Christian was OK. Also, they cannot focus much on his character because the books are always about Ana, Ana, Ana... 2. It was funny, some stupid dialogues which could have been replaced or shortened, but it also had scenes that made you smile and see that they tried to do better. 3. There is vanilla sex in this part of the movies because this is how the book is. The kinky/dark part was in the 1st book, which, as we know, the movie failed to bring it. 4. Stop being so harsh!

Feels like the movie is only loosely based on the books. To top it all, the things the male lead says and does are simply not in line with his screen character either. He comes off weak, and pathetic, despite Jamie Dornan's attempts to save the day. The movie as it is makes it look like the actors can't act. I bet they were in stitches during shooting. Erika Leonard the author of the books made a 1500 pages long point about the power of connection between two person. She calls it an electrifying current that is in a constant flow between them. Everything else stems from there. They cannot resist one another. They are a slave of this love, cannot get enough of each other, they adore each other. Why is this lost in the screenplay? The screen characters are just lame. Didn't Mr Leonard get the books? Where is the unbearable pain, with the constantly flowing tears brought on by the profound grief of loosing such a love? There is a confusion about the red room too. It should be pretty clear that throughout their relationship its use and meaning transfers as in: \"We aim to please\" for the man. And comes in play in terms of pleasure for the girl propelled by their trusting and overwhelming love for each other. The books are such a success because they portray the binding and transforming power of love, the palpable connection, the never enough pleasing each other, the overwhelming loveliness of each others company! The characters really do care about each other. It is something we all yearn for, appreciate and celebrate, gives meaning to life. Unfortunately it's all lost in the screenplay. FSD gives out mixed messages, dangerous even.There is a profound problem with almost every scene in the movie. Cudos to Bella Heathcote, she was good.

The story becomes much more nuanced with plenty of dynamics on the go.SPOILERS from now onCan they maintain a \"vanilla\" relationship? Is he going to become controlling again and ruin things? Will she let it get out of control and ruin things also or stay on it? Who is that stalky girl and what happened to her exactly? what about his mother? and that ex of his? Will something occur with her infatuated boss?On top of all of this, I realised while watching that the series was never about a bizarre sadist control freak, it's actually about all men and the story of a woman trying to find the balance between accepting or desiring the dominant behaviour of the male archetype and maintaining strength and independence in such a relationship.While of course the fact that he is rich, while possibly relating to the power struggle, looks like it is going to be more and more used for generating further drama.

Basically it has been some time since young corporate executive Christian Grey (The Fall's Razzie nominated Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele (Razzie nominated Dakota Johnson) broke up, Ana is now working as an assistant to Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson), an editor at Seattle Independent Publishing, who has more than a casual interest in Ana. Ana attends the evening of the art gallery show for her photographer friend Jose Rodriguez (Victor Rasuk), she is shocked Christian is there, she reluctantly agrees to have dinner with him. Christian tells Ana he wants her back, but she is reluctant because his sexual pleasure in inflicting pain and sticking to his contract, he insists he is changing, and will agree to Ana's terms of no rules and no punishments, if they will resume their relationship, she agrees. A few days later, Ana is interrupted by a woman who bears a striking resemblance to her, she later goes to dinner with Jack, Christian sees him flirting with Ana, he warns her of Jack's obvious intentions, and tells her that he plans to take over SIP where Ana works. While out with Christian for breakfast, Ana sees the same woman watching from a distance, Christian does not answer Ana immediately when she asks who she is, at home he reveals it is Leila Williams (Bella Heathcote), one of his former submissives. Christian explains that after Leila's contract ended, she wanted more to their relationship, but he did not, she found herself a husband, but he died, this caused her to have a mental breakdown and become suicidal, she has been stalking Christian and Ana for a while. Christian invites Ana to a masquerade ball with an auction, to prepare for the ball Christian takes Ana to beauty salon Esclava, there Ana sees Elena Lincoln (Razzie winning Kim Basinger), Christian's former dominant who introduced him to the BDSM lifestyle, Ana is furious Christian would take her there, and that he co-owns the salon with Elena. At the ball, Ana learns more about Christian, including being expelled from schools for fighting, and his biological mother being a prostitute and crack addict, Christian reveals his mother committed suicide, Grace Trevelyan Grey (Marcia Gay Harden) cared for him in hospital, and later adopted him. Elena confronts Ana, telling her to break up with Christian and warning her, Ana ignores her and tells her to stop meddling in their relationship, returning home Christian and Ana find her car vandalised. A few days later, when the SIP offices close, Jack tries to seduce Ana, she refuses and escapes, Christian finds out and arranges for Jack to be dismissed, he also asks Ana to move in with him, she agrees, the next day Ana takes the vacant position of temporary acting editor for SIP. Ana and Christian go to her apartment to collect her belongings, there Leila appears and threatens Ana with a gun, she fires a shot into the wall, but Leila is subdued by Christian and his bodyguard Jason Taylor (Max Martini). Ana sees that Christian can still only be satisfied with his controlling and domination, she walks out and does not return until the night, Christian is furious with her, Ana explains she needs time. Christian does not want to lose Ana, he drops to his knees and turns submissive, finally allowing her to touch him in his restricted areas, they kiss and have sex. during the night, after being awoken by Ana from a nightmare, Christian asks Ana to marry him, she says she needs time to think about it. Christian leaves for a few days on a business trip, while piloting his helicopter there is engine failure, causing it to crash somewhere in the forest, the news breaks out that Christian is missing, Ana and Christian's family wait for news, until he unexpectedly arrives, Ana is overwhelmed he is safe, realising the extent of her feelings for Christian, she accepts his marriage proposal. At Christian's birthday party, the engagement is announced to the guests, Elena is there and furious, calling Ana a gold digger, Ana angrily throws a drink in her face and tells her to stop interfering, Christian and ? Grace overhear, Christian tells Elena she only taught him sex, never love, Grace slaps Elena and tells her to get out, Christian cuts all ties with Elena. In the end, as the birthday festivities begin, Christian proposes to Ana at the boathouse, with a ring, she accepts, as fireworks erupt in the sky, Jack is the watching Ana and Christian from afar. Also starring Luke Grimes as Elliot Grey, Eloise Mumford as Kate Kavanagh and singer Rita Ora as Mia Grey. Johnson is only slightly less naive as the besotted and feisty young woman, and Dornan is still a pervy billionaire, only slightly less controlling, they are more believable as a couple this time, and Basinger and Eric Johnson are only relatively alright being the nasty ones. I am relieved to say that I found this film much more bearable than the previous, the change of director helps, the writing is slightly improved, there are more softcore sex scenes that are a little more comfortable than before, and the kinky and edgy bits are a little less embarrassing, it remains glossy and somewhat gigglesome in its approach, but overall it is a slightly better erotic romantic drama. It won the Razzie for Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, and it was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Screen Combo for Any Combination of Two Characters, Two Sex Toys or Two Sexual Positions and Worst Screenplay. Worth watching!",

Christian (Jamie Dornan) finally realized that he could not let Anastasia (Dekota Johnson) go. He fought for her with Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson) and Elena (Kim Basinger).This movie is more focused on Christians past and what turned him into the person he is, he opens up to Anastasia slowly but surly and lets her touch his scared body.Christian wakes up due to a nightmare in one wholesome scene and Anastasia attends to him with comfort, this kind of made him realize how much of an impact Ana has on him AND his life, so he asks her to marry him!This movie definitely has its wholesome moments unlike the first move (fifty shades of grey)",

The entire film seems a ugly trailer. The music is only a distant echo of that of the first film. Christian appears sloppy, inconsistent, lacking in personality. Ana has no personality, but what can you with a screenplay like this ...It seems that both the director and screenwriter have never read the books and that the author, so meticulous and careful in monitoring implementation of the first film, she went, for the second, on vacation somewhere.A special, not relevant but significant (and is indicative of a total lack of care with which it was carried throughout the film and liquidated in a hurry) is the adopted brother of Christian, Elliot that in the first film was fun and bright, in FSD chewing gum throughout the film: horrible.In Fifty Shades of Gray, Sam Taylor-Johnson had hit the mark and photography of Seamus McGarvey had made magic every detail. Everything had a very refined taste and was totally devoid of vulgarity. The excitement of the first film remain only a beautiful memory: I'm really very disappointed.",

            "content": "extremely disappointed. for a 2 hour movie, they seemed to have squished every possible plot line they could in without tying the loose ends together. they may do in the third film, but most of them made little sense and had almost no relevance to the overall story. to expand on this, what was the point of having Christian involved in a helicopter accident? i understand that if he had of died or suffered an extreme injury such as brain damage, that would have affected the plot line greatly and would have been somewhat intriguing to see how his relationship with Ana continued with such a disadvantage, or didn't continue at all. however, he came out of it with nothing but a few scratches, had Anastasia and his family worried sick, and that was that. completely unnecessary, and if you ask me, they could have spent more time strengthening and deepening Christian and Ana's emotional relationship instead, revealing more of Christian's inner demons and how Ana is slowly teaching him how to love instead of dominate. i thought that plot line was interesting and one that definitely could have done with more attention. it was brushed over once or twice with the lipstick and shower scene, and again, that was that.another plot line that seemed a little messy to me was how Anastasia was being stalked by one of Christian's past submissive's due to jealousy. she held a gun to her, interrogated her almost, when Christian stepped in to protect Ana. he informed Ana the girl wasn't important, that he was finished with that chapter of his life, and alas, that was that. we never really learned more about the young girl's history personally or with Christian, or why she cared so much about stalking and hurting Ana. that could have been an interesting plot line if it was continued or even ended properly rather than quickly.moving on to Anastasia's creepy boss. where was this plot line leading to? or was it a sort of filler plot to show viewers the lengths Christian would go to keep Ana safe? i'm unsure, but overall, it seemed like a slight waste of time. when the boss was introduced first, the way he looked at Ana suggested he was interested in her on a deeper level than just boss to employee, which did spark a curiosity within me to see where it would lead. it began with him quite frustratingly telling her to book a hotel room to join him in new York on some business expedition, but it was quite obvious as to why he wanted to get her there alone. it ended not long after when Ana told him she couldn't go, and he pinned her to the door and forcefully told her how much better being with him (sexually) rather than Christian would be. of course, Christian was waiting for Ana just outside, so she runs into his arms and that's that. kind of pointless? as a plot line, they could have expanded on the boss personally; why was he like that (background wise), why did he want an unavailable woman who was his colleague, knowing she was with one of the most powerful businessmen? they could have had him and Ana interact more to give the audience glimpses of his intentions bit by bit instead of him all of a sudden trapping her against a door. it was all a bit quick and could have been focused on more, if not at all.i didn't mind the plot line involving Christian's past dominant, his mother's friend. however, i do think her obsession with Anastasia was a little overboard. i mean, destroying her car just to let her know she's not the one for Christian?this sounds petty, but i'm not too sure about the choice of names. i love Anastasia, but then having her assistant/co-worker be named Hannah? Ana and Hannah - it just sounded off when they would talk to each other. i'm also not sure of this character but i think she was one of Ana's bosses and had black hair. and then when we came across Christian's mother, these two characters looked almost identical and it was fair to say i was confused for a bit. last but not least, the marriage proposal! WHAT! how so soon? at the beginning they had only just got back together after Christian had done unmentionable, sadistic things to Anastasia. and even then, Anastasia had said she wanted to take things slow, which of course failed. and by the end of the film they're engaged? it's probably just because it's a film and things need to move fast, but i was quite shocked. i thought a plot line as big as this could have been focused on more in the third film, if there is one, after they had been together longer and experienced more hurdles as a steady couple.overall, this movie was quite horrible and didn't really do the book justice! it was messy and just a bit 'all over the place'. if they do end up making a third movie, i sincerely hope for the sake of EL James that the story is portrayed and tied up nicely!",

            "content": "Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan reprise their roles as Ms. Steele and Christian Grey, respectively, in \"Fifty Shades Darker.\" After being freaked out by Dornan's sadist ways in \"Fifty Shades Of Grey,\" Johnson quickly gets back together with Dornan after setting up a \"no rules, no punishment\" alteration to their original relationship. Things seem to go well until a weird, disheveled chick starts appearing intermittently to freak out Johnson; sexual harasser/creepy boss named Jack Hyde (dude, seriously, this is a name that I would come up with back when I was 14-years-old writing short stories, so it kind of gives you a hint as to the writing talents of the screenwriter and/or author of the books) comes on strong to Johnson, which freaks her out; and \"Mrs. Robinson\" is revealed, giving Johnson advice about she's not good enough for Dornan and she needs to leave him, which freaks out Johnson.So with all this stuff going on \u2014 and handled badly by the screenwriter/director/editor \u2014 what is the spine, or theme of this movie? If I had to guess, it's Johnson and Dornan trying to change for each other, trying to find a compromise so that they can continue their relationship. That's all good and well; but \"Fifty Shades Darker\" is less focused and more comedic (not deliberately, I bet) than the first movie, and the first movie was no masterpiece. I know that most sequels tend to be of a less quality than their predecessors, but in the case of \"Fifty Shades Darker,\" the difference in quality is really jarring. It felt as if there were 10 drafts of the movie, and instead of the 10th, polished draft being produced, the 3rd draft got produced. Moving on\u0085 My most memorable, movie moment of \"FSD\" is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Dornan tells a creepy, former submissive who is flipping out to \"kneel,\" and she does so instantaneously. This is probably the best written scene of the movie, as it shows Dornan's immense power over his former subs; Dornan's possible, continued need for that kind of pure obedience; and Johnson's full realization that she can never give that to Dornan.Bottom line, for those who didn't understand nor liked the first movie, you'll definitely hate this one. But for those who were entertained by the first movie, as I was, you'll probably want to see \"FSD\" because you want to see how things turn out, despite the cheesy, corny, ridiculous events and dialogue. Look, it's like a two hour soap opera, and if treated as such, and you are the type to get entertained by soap operas and soft core porn, then \"Fifty Shades Darker\" may be a decent piece of entertainment for a couple of hours. Of course, if watched with a significant other, the entertainment value of this movie goes up significantly (insert winky face here).Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",

            "content": "Hunky squillionaire Christian Grey likes to strap up girlfriends and spank them until their bums go red. Having relieved incredibly nice improbable virgin Anastasia of her virginity in a dead romantic and non-pervy fashion, she subsequently reacts badly to having her bum whacked, and terminates their relationship. And that's where this film begins.And, while it has the odd bit of fetish activity in it, it mostly amounts to a conventional romantic drama peppered with the problems which rich and mildly sexually perverted people tend to encounter, like exes turning up with guns, malicious Mrs Robinson-types seeking to stick a spoke into your current relationship, crashing your helicopter on Mount St Helens, and the like.Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are likeable and have some chemistry together. That chemistry isn't particularly sexual: for a film drawn from a source which is notorious for the appeal of its sexual fetish content, this film is sparse and coy in that regard. It is also singularly unerotic notwithstanding the fact that both Dornan and Johnson look attractive without clothes. No, I'm not being entirely truthful - there is a short sequence in a lift which is more erotic than all the naughty bits in this film and its predecessor put together.I confess that, while I normally quite enjoy watching attractive young people engaging in sexual activity, the specifics of Christian Grey's proclivities are pretty much the antithesis of what turns me on. Having said that, I repeat that there is relatively little of that stuff here, and it's not valid grounds for criticising a film anyway.Better grounds for criticism are that, despite the best efforts of the actors, the characters are fundamentally unconvincing, as are the glitches in their relationship and, indeed, the other problems they face. The sole interesting issue from the first film - should two incompatible people seek to change each other fundamentally? - is here avoided because that is simply what happens, with no agonising, soulsearching, or explanation. What is left is glossy soap opera with mild perversion.The film is basically a shambles, and I offer no speculation as to whether this is the fault of the source novel, or the screenplay (written by the novelist's husband).I am sure that the white middle-class women who bought the books by the lorryload, and went to see episode one in droves, will be along to see this one, too. They may well be disappointed, because I couldn't detect much by way of forbidden frisson.And for anyone not in the target demographic, I can't honestly recommend this. In fact, I rather feel that I went to see this so that you don't have to. How very public-spirited of me. You can thank me by not going to see it unless you are dragged along by the missus.",

Not as strong a team as Round One. But then there are may little things that dim the lights on this outing - less sincere chemistry between the lead couple, too much meandering in wealthy parties, an unshaven Christian Grey (just to keep up with the styles) and the addition of some unsavory characters who attempt to add tension but without enough back story to make it work.The plot - Christian (Jamie Dornan) and Ana (Dakota Johnson) decide to rekindle their relationship, except this time there are no more rules or punishments. As they begin to get used to their newfound relationship, Christian's past (fifteen prior women, childhood abuse, a nasty sordid affair (Bella Heathcote) and the threat of a strange woman (Kim Basinger) begins to haunt Ana as Christian struggles with his innermost thoughts.

The film picks up from where the first film was left, the film sticks pretty close to the novel which was nice to see. this film for me was an improvement on the first one, probably down to the fact James Foley directed this one, once again the cinematography was absolutely beautiful, i take my hat off to John Schwartzman. The soundtrack to both of this films so far have been excellent and fitted in with the plot perfectly. the on screen chemistry between the two main characters Christian and Ana i feel is better in the second one, the film starts with Christian trying to fix his mistakes and goes on to Ana dealing with issues from his past. We get to know the characters a lot more in this film as Christian opens up more to Ana and shows his vulnerable side. and the DRAMA follows. okay here it is.. the sex scenes... are... better? i thought they were less awkward in this film, and sexier, Dakota seems to be more comfortable on screen with the nudity now which makes the scenes a lot easier to watch. overall this film is well made, funny, dramatic and romantic. 6.5/10Forget everything you have heard about this film and watch it with an open mind, who knows, you might even like it.",

I didn't have high expectations going in due to some of the poor reviews but I left feeling satisfied and entertained. Dakota and Jamie DO have amazing chemistry despite what others have written. She is a much better written character in this story than the first and he is also much more realistic in the sense that he seems like he could actually exist (the first movie was very unrealistic to the point of laughable) I liked the dark twists in this one and they all led to an important part in the story. I.E. The helicopter scene was a bit cheesy but they needed to write that in to have Anna's character realize she can't live without him. It could've been a car crash or something a bit more realistic considering he's walking into his apartment hours later. But whatever! This is an erotica/fantasy/drama and it's made for you to escape your reality for 2 hours. These two have gorgeous bodies and amazing chemistry and the story is fun and entertaining. What more do you want from an erotica/fantasy/drama? Geez. Everyone needs to relax and let go from all the uptight expectations for this type of film. I give it 7 stars (6 for the film but I bumped it up to 7 for Jamie's bod) :) Go see it, and have some fun at the movies for once!",

Jamie Dornan improves on his performance as Christian from the first movie. Dakota Johnson is still funny and brilliant as Ana.The movie delivers on all fronts with its core audience.It includes many great scenes from the book.Some parts of the book that are not included IMO were not missed.The only problem I had was that I wished a few scenes in the movie were fleshed out a little better, adding a few more lines of dialogue to explain what was happening in the scene.But my husband, who has not read the books, liked it.Go see this movie.It's worth the price of a ticket.",

            "content": "What's hard for me to figure out is why the books don't translate well into films. Both of these films follow the books pretty closely with the exception of changing subtle things like settings and cutting certain things. For instance when you read the book their sex is very descriptive but the sex scenes in this film last all of thirty seconds or so. I still don't find their chemistry to be all that great but better than the first film. They remind me of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart in the sense that it's like well I got picked for the part and you got picked for the part too bad we're not that great together. Which while on that subject safe to say Fifty Shades is basically Twilight for adults. Anastasia or Anna is a virgin like Isabella or Bella. They both love literature and lose it to a man they marry (with one waiting til marriage). Our leading men both with formal names are dark and although appearing confident are insecure. Christian's sister Mia is basically Alice. Also in new moon a crazy chick was after them just like Darker. Edward's father is a doctor. Christian's mother is a doctor. Its almost as if E.L James read Twilight, took out vampires and werewolves, and put in lots of sex. I didn't like the fact that Jack was more evil in the movie than he was in the book. He's basically just used so there can be a third novel/film. Reading the books, however over the top they may be, has been a much better experience than seeing the films. I don't even think people who haven't read the books would like these movies that much because they don't go into as much detail. Also my biggest complaint was that they completely cut out Dr. Flynn Christian's therapist. They insinuate he'll just get better telling Anna his secrets when a big part of his recovery is therapy. Dr. Flynn is literally the one who tells Christian to try a relationship Anna's way. Lastly the soundtrack was terrible. It felt like listening to teeny bop music while watching adults have sex it was weird. Frigging Twilight had a more adult soundtrack! Anyway to sum up for the second time around the books just don't translate well into films. It's nice to stare at pretty actors with great bodies but that's pretty much all these films will ever be.",

Usually this kind of films do great business, but ratings and reviews does not praise or encourage the film. So I doubt anybody will be bored of it, which means watchable film and instead it won't be their favourite.The story continued and this time it was not based on experiment or any kind of agreement, but mutual understanding. So the billionaire Grey and Ana's erotic adventure sustains. With the small-small developments the film goes all the way to the ending. That means, those who are watching it for the selected scenes, will surely would have a nice time. But nothing was strong as any European film on the similar theme.Apart from the weak storyline, there's nothing wrong with it. As to what this film is about, it served better. That's what I say to you not to expect full storied romance-drama. As usual the actors were good and another two films to come in the 'Fifty Shades' franchise. I hope they can be better than the first two. Overall, it is only for the selected audience, but curiosity makes everybody watch it and they all pour they perspective which is flooded with average to negative. Otherwise, it is an acceptable film.6/10",

So turn your lights off, and while you're up just turn the TV off as well because there is no point watching this. Granted, this is ever so slightly better than it's predecessor. But that's like saying cat litter tastes nicer than dog poo, they're both excrements. I mean where to begin with the story? Christian Grey yearns for Anastasia and becomes a creepy stalker. Will they? Won't they? Again, I don't care. Oh, and random people from his past keep popping up like an unwanted STD. Speaking of, we were graced with Mr Grey ripping off a condom in the first film, just to encourage safe sex. In this? None of that. Spreading disease at a rate of Oprah Winfrey audience members getting presents. \"You get a disease! You get a disease! Everybody gets a disease!!\". We have our usual accompaniment of pop songs to the raunchy sex scenes. Bending over a pool table, bed or even the floor...that's about as raunchy as it gets. I actually miss the whips...what have I become!? The sex now just seems forced as it's no longer a plot device, but isn't that the point of this franchise? The acting and chemistry between our two leads is much better and far more watchable, with less cringeworthy lines of dialogue. It's still damn atrocious, just more tolerable. The pace is horrendously sluggish! Two hours! Felt like four. So many unexplored sub-plots that amount to nothing. Rita Ora though...perfection. She genuinely seems excited to be there. No one else does, just give them their wages and be done with this series. Will I be watching this again? Nope. This is just the kind of thing I put myself through for friendship. Foolish me.",

            "content": "\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" if I remember correctly, was pretty much content in setting up various subplots and side characters without ever developing their relevance or relationships to the main couple. It ended with Anastasia running away from Christian because he went too far during sex. Within the first ten minutes of \"Fifty Shades Darker,\" the two are back together. In other words, if you've missed the first installment, it doesn't matter much.One thing the predecessor had going for it, though, was the director Sam Taylor-Johnson, who actively worked against the laughable dialogue and uninspired plotting of the script. Together with her DP they even managed to sneak some interesting visual ideas into the thing. After a much-publicized falling-out, Taylor-Johnson has now been replaced with James Foley, and with her the last hint of subtlety has departed the franchise.Which is not to say that \"Darker\" is, as its title and the marketing would suggest, is a more aggressive and raunchy chapter in the trilogy, far from it. The sex scenes (that's what we're here for after all, right?) are not too far removed from what you would see in your average James Bond flick. There's maybe a higher number of sex toys on display here, and there are even some breasts and buttocks to be seen, but all in all, given the franchise's reputation, I was expecting much more out of an erotic thriller about S&M. Most of the sex scenes are even filmed in the same way (shadowy silhouettes shot from the side) and have overbearing pop music going on in the background, so it's hard to get into them all that much. The movie just seems to stop every couple minutes to show us a music video.Other than sex, the movie tries to sell itself by its thriller leanings. Throughout the movie we get glimpses of mysterious characters and hints of tension, but all of these suspenseful elements are always resolved just a few scenes later, usually by Christian appearing out of the blue. Whereas the first movie kept its subplots underdeveloped, this one is even worse. If being held at gunpoint and (later) potentially getting raped are only minor footnotes to the larger story and don't affect our protagonist for more than one or two scenes, why should we care about anything anymore in this story?I guess it's the romance the film is about. However, I rarely had so much trouble suspending my disbelief during sex scenes. You know the trope of teenagers having sex while the killer stalks them in slasher movies? The whole of \"Fifty Shades Darker\" felt like that. During the first 40 minutes or so, there are only three types of scenes: People warning Ana about Christian, Christian behaving like a dick towards Ana, and Christian and Ana having sex. I'm not Alfred Kinsey, but I don't think that's how sexual arousal works. Most of the relationship talk happens through text messages and their dates are even more music-video like than the sex scenes. It's very hard to get into the love story, especially since Jamie Dornan is not very charming in this role (he looks the part, though) and Dakota Johnson acts constantly intimidated, speaking in a quiet voice so as to not disturb her boyfriend. You want to tell her not to get in cars with strangers, not see her have \"kinky\" sex with her millionaire lover.There is indeed a thriller in this. If you replaced the pop music and the gentle Danny Elfman score with a Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross soundtrack, you'd have a less-beautiful, worse-written and woodener-acted David Fincher film about an abusive, dysfunctional relationship between an insecure weak-willed girl and a psychologically damaged rich playboy who preys on women like her. All the elements are in place, even Christian's relatives and other surrounding characters and the fact that Ana's friends only ever appear after two-thirds into the film, isolating her from real life, are in place. They just didn't wanna go there (probably because SM movies that actually break taboos aren't as easily marketable), so what we're stuck with is this mess of a movie with very little plot.I know it's a clich\u00e9 to hate on these movies, but I just don't see what makes them good in any way. \"Fifty Shades Darker\" doesn't look exceptional, the acting is bland, the story just repeats the same three or four beats for over two hours, the music is distracting ... Nope, this isn't good.",

The saving grace was the characters themselves. Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as Christian Gray both took off exactly where they left. Gradual progression of their relationship is an intriguing watch, as they are relatable and likable to a certain extent.\nThey graced the sensuality with sincere audacity but at the same time too much of the same ruined the essence out of it. After a certain period of time, one can easily predict their love making skills. If you are directing a Luscious craft, atleast make it tempting enough.

Of watching something bad for the sake of making fun of it?) Anyways, I'm going to take the liberty of just saying things as they are, this may contain spoilers but does anyone really cares?This movie is terrible, not for one or two reasons, there are too many. But there is ONE, one in particular that drives me insane. Anastasia, a recently graduated literature student gets her dream job and becomes an editor after being molested by her boss. I am myself a literature major, can someone explain me how can I get such a great job opportunity, because so far things are quite the opposite. I know movies do not have to be realistic all the time, but this gets really dumb. If Anastasia was a real person, a real literature major she would hate this book. If she was really a talented editor she would think this book is garbage. It doesn't make any sense.The plot is ridiculous, we know that from the previous movie, but in this second part nothing major happens, where is the story here. Worst than that is the lack of sensuality in this film, is supposed to be about the sexual relationship between these characters, why there is no heat? Yes, the chemistry is a little better than in the original, but still not sexy at all. Dakota's performance is blank and quite annoying, especially in the sex scenes. The sex is just that, sex. Even when they are in the red room, they use gadgets and stuff but nothing crazy, nothing worthy of a BDSM title. The characters are boring and unlikable. You don't get to understand what is so cool about Anastasia to completely \"change\" Cristian because he does seem to be pushed into this new persona very quickly. He is a sadist (stated in his own word) however, he is able to stop being one because he is in love. That simple.I actually think that a story between a BSDM participant and a newcomer could be very interesting, but narrated in the right way. Not an obscenely rich guy falling in love with a boring girl with no personality of her own. I feel ashamed that an awful book like this became a best seller. However, I do have the hope that one day these books and movies will be remembered just as an unfortunate joke.",

            "review_title": "Where Are \"Hearts & Flowers\"?",
            "content": "Two years ago, Universal Pictures agreed to display the preceding unreasoning erotic-romance adaptation thought up by British E. L. James, such recklessness led to a storm of dissimilar opinions between movie critics and audience, however, and deplorably the most transcendental for the film production company, was a rotund monetary attainment, not only in its homeland but in the whole world, in part by its relentless readers and partly by its strategic launch date.Valentine's day is the picked day for releasing Jamie Dornan' and Dakota Johnson's sadomasochistic fair tale. Numerous are irrational alterations within this sequel, nonetheless, the germination of all these changes lies in its hard directional shift, as Taylor-Wood hand her director chair (within allowable boundaries) over to the filmmaker of some episodes of well-liked TV series such as \"House of Cards\" or \"Billions\", James Foley.Even though \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" wasn't well-received by most film critics, one of the most relevant swaps with the original novel was the very light but pertinent conversion in Anna's identity, the main female role. On the pages, she's fragile, more naive and more permissive; on the other hand, her effigy on screen is romantic but self-reliant, a suffragist but submissive woman, and although her mission about women's empowerment did not work, it gives something moderately axiomatic away from denigrated trilogy of James. That is probably the main conflict of the latest installment, the austere and fussy accuracy to the reference book. This time, the intrepid woman who opposed the selfsame creator has gone, foolishly, Niall Leonard, Mitchell's husband, writes and sketches empty, futile and even squalid contingencies and characters.-\"Ana\"; -\"Christian\", the metal and heavy elevator door closes tenaciously. This was the unbreathable and astute ending of the initial film, leaving the protagonist in floods of tears, thinking every day about him and trying to start over. The motion picture in question takes place ridiculously three weeks after what has happened, and I say \"ridiculous\" by unconnected and soporific distortions between the leading roles; in just three weeks, Mr. Grey suddenly forgets his firm sexual priorities to become into the authentic submissive of the story-line, in which Anastasia Steele looks more experienced, more libidinous and superficially more greedy. Fallible resolutions go on in the hands of three idle and anodyne antagonists, who covet to fracture the happy new relationship, at the same time that Grey struggles with his intrinsic shades of yesterday and today.\"Darker\", this is evidently the wrong term. Even the film opens with an involuntary self-parody about its suggestive title, are some alba roses too dark? Such name is only one tactic more in order to insinuate improving previous flaws, however, the only thing that they get is to underline them with darker ink.Leonard and Foley are a dangerous duo for the romance genre, and this should not be taken as a compliment. On this occasion, they coat it a dismal, unsatisfactory and unfounded thriller aroma; a series of circumstances poorly posed, developed and resolved. How is it possible that after being on the brink of death, he just wants to have more sex?. Besides, new characters inclusion is simply execrable, providing irregular performances, with traces of university film and a limited run-time on screen for revealing their talents, wasted time in close- ups of the main leads looking each other in the eyes.Despite the unfathomable dissatisfaction I felt, there is another portion which we can praise. The first one, openly, is its protagonist. Although Johnson can't save all the footage, she does not allow her character from drowning in that sea of insipidness and boredom, on the other hand, gives it a particular empathy. Another satisfactory feature is the partial revelation of Christian's dismal past, even accompanied by flashbacks, hence he achieved a longer participation, showing his fascinating acting talent for those minds that still watching \"The Fall\" by BBC Two.In technical aspects, we can see major improvements within staging with regard to the previous film, with soft but amended erotic overtures, that even if they do not reach the expected level of arousal, it delivers elaborated challenges. Likewise, fireworks, masks, sex toys, parties, restaurants, Grey's remodeled penthouse and the usual Seattle aerial shots are perceived differently due to their nocturnal and attractive tones. Like its predecessor, sound support is vital both harmonizing the sensual shots and decorating fickle moments. Although the dreamlike rhythms of Legend, Sia, Swift or composer Danny Elfman do not convince for another Academy Awards nomination, they fit with complacency within artistically precious scenes, for example, Anastasia walking under the rain.\"Darker\" destabilizes first movie spectacular expectations due to reduced chemistry of its lead actors, its poorly constructed ambitions and a series of failed elections which lose out the limited potential of James' erotic books. Grey needs to marry, forget his past and be an ordinary boyfriend, reveal his shades; Anastasia wants to be the boss of the publishing house, covets more sex, yearns for redeeming men with psychological problems, now he's who wants flowers and hearts and she wants to f**k hard. An ex- submissive lurking, a stalker boss and a grown up lady try to end the relationship; with its dull ending, \"Darker\" insinuates becoming into a thriller of killers instead of romantic frippery that it should aspire to be.",

BEWARE: LOADSA PLOT SPOILERS HERE!!!Having been 'tempted' to 'suffer' all three in the trilogy, first, gotta start out by acknowledging Dakota Johnson playing her role of innocent ingenue so convincingly well must be commended - especailly through all her 'introduced to' sexual encounters ..\nbut otherwise, really, that's about it for a film I normally would not feel worth to add in any review on such an out and out clunker, but this one has to be commented on, and come with warnings!Not of what you might be shocked / offended by presented in its based on oeuvre of writer E.L.James' lengthy online novel, but from the sheer crassness and ideed insult not only to its target audience, presumably of women expecting another sorta 'Pretty Woman' like version love story, but those who might somehow be curious to the now entwined around some oh la la of hanky panky kinky sex play: \nthat much is (over well) known from the first (reasonably intriguing, enlightening) screen adaptation directed by (female team to boot) Sam Taylor - Johnson (i.e original 'Shades of Grey'):\nbut in this - and it must be added (as filmed, ah, back to back) its follow up 'Freed', by exactly the same team sequel (plot spolier alert = freed to marry!) - indicates why it is simply a no no to have the author themself, ah, intimately onboard involved, but that even more so, if you recruit your very own husband to adapt your own novel for the screenplay:\nthis just 'scream's out (from pain infliction?) travesty of the kink world it purports to plunder for update conceit of 'boy meets gal, but sadly boy is deeply damaged, so gal rejects boy, boy respects (smitten by) her own mind strength of personality gal, so falls in love with, sees error of his ways, re-woos gal, who having tamed him, finds him now admirable marriageable material to finally accept and live ludricously rich lifestyle happy ever after!' (Sorry, if that spoilt the plot: you were warned above!)Even more so if priorly mistreated misunderstood boy is young and handsome and implausibly rich, too - e.g. so much so he can buy the buiness of his playing hard to get (hard to spank!) gal and protect her from sleazy (#metoo!) office boss sexual predator: and which just coincidentally means she moves up into managemnent position of her ideal job.And all because he is a misunderstood as 'I can't help my abused upbringing' sadism: we know that, coz he tells her he is just a sadist and (quel horreur) just wants to hurt women - and because of his Mom, too! See: damaged = needs loving, caring rescuing: that outburst coming just before genuflecting on his knees before her, as her having now effectively tamed her sadist - and so most certainly he's NOT a (mere) 'dominant' who just needs a companianble, ergo willing, sub - even if she doesn't realise that is what gets her mojo working with him - well, just yet (i.e. 'till he's introduced her to all his kinky 'red room' shenanigans and released the sexual adventuress hidden inside her: we know that, too, because his previous 'mentor' / elder woman tells her that: \"he needs a submissive!\"):So, she falls in love with this damaged - although just coincidentally ludricously wealthy - 'sadist' but because, unlike all his previous conquests, she plays hard to get (not sure if she can deal with his kinks) he's certain she's the one one for him.\nWe know that, too, becuase one of his former - too obeisant, apparently - clinches follows him / her (them) around; to the extent she not only watches them sleeping together (in their room!) but later to confront her with a loaded gun (we know, coz it goes off, but fortunately aimed to just miss her):\nwhich is despite that throughout, this absurdly rich young catch is so desirable and / or that envied, he has security with him and for her everywhere: yet at both those times they are not around! If they were my security I would have fired and replaced them long ago: \nas, incidentally, similarly too with his security now cum mecahnic saftety detail, since in the scene set up for her to finally realise she truly loves / could not live without, him (his riches?!), his helocopter goes into some sort of 'we have a problem' whilst gallivanting over a dormant volacno: yet, of course, he is so playboy skilled he not only manages to keep it (interminably) flying down to ground across some impenetrable jungle like scenery, but stll manages to spot a convenient clearing in which to crash land so accurately that although so important to be on the evening news reporting him missing, yet lo and behold, he suddenly turns up with nary a scratch (oh sorry, forehead did have a minor cut) from his own penthouse lift entrance - broadcast is still on, too. (Same for his partner, presumably both having not only climbed out of the crashed copter, but then found their way home safe and sound before the day out ....)As preposterous as the supposed kink aspect of dom finding his suppressed sub who eventually can't get enough of his red room delights **: \nthat itself so well equipped, yet, as she becomes more enamoured, inquistive to the sexual shock potential within, all he can suddenly thrill her with is a leg extender, which he soon uses to merely about backside turn her over for yet another rear entry coupling with her **: \nalthough to be fair, 'tis true, just afore, he does thoughtfully get, ah, 'down' to her - which, no doubt mindful of her pleasure, he quite often does, but as always within a matter of seconds it seems, that's soon over for her and she's over to his seemingly desperate (vanilla!) humping of her: not so caring of your partner's needs really (and if ya wanna know what going down there can be like for the recipient, check out Rachel Weiz in recent 'Disobedience': but then that's UNDERtaken by someone who should know what's exprected - a woman.)Even as she begins to become inveigled into his sadistic (!) 'needs' she begins to minxily suggest, direct the 'kinky' sexual forplay: \ntwice she engineers the scenario to now even ask herself to be spanked: \nthe first he about turns her for another bum up again, and gives her (just!) four mildly wan slaps, and on (just!) one cheek and then he's at her vanilla* sex-like yet again: that's all she gets (ah, well, coz he knows it's a damaged aberration and he loves her 'normally' dosen't he?)\nThe next (at least in the uncut, non-theatrical version) after deliberately losing a pool game (so good she's winning up to the point that she would allow the white ball to roll into the pocket after final potted? Yeah.), the spanking she has now not only specifically asked for, but deliberately lost / played for, she now doesn't even get at all, but instead yet another turn about rear entry hump, presumably to his need, not hers, again (and really, is he so desperate that in virtually every coitus, his trousers never get much below the top of his ass: really? Do men ALWAYS keep their trews on when so engaged?!)\nEven the 'oh really' kink frisson for the unknowing 'vanilla' * crowd, he 'introduces' ah, 'into' her, love eggs: soon after she is wandering around even dancing at a masked ball yet with nary a below frisson twinge - except when she is sitting: patently absurd ignorant sexual thrill nonsense!**Presumably this is seen as a supposed to be somehow sorta udated version of Fanny Hill, Story of O and the likes, where the woman of the 'sadist' conquers the obssesed (damaged!) enslaved men through their submissive's control over the realisation of his desire (kink), which in the end, so becomes her who controls him, because of the irresistible kink desire for her.\nHere, he proposes to her... (althogther now, ahhh.)Overall, not only insulting to women as to how they can get their (rich, oh so rich) man of their dreams (allow him to smack ya bum, coz otherwise you wouldn't, would ya?), but preposterous to those who believe this husband and wife team script would release the vanilla!* we know that coz at one point when she takes him supermarket shopping (he's ludricously rich!) she tosses him an oh so pointed product placement 'Ben and Jerry's VANILLA ice cream tub! Geddit? What next tie in? B&J's 'Red(fruit) bum flush ice cream?** spoiling the second sequel here: \ne.g. when exploring on her own, she pulls out one drawer and there are some, er, odd shaped 'things', as, presumably referencing back to the original detailing the contract scene (recall?), for those in the know (but isn't it aimed at those who don't know - yet?) are a range of butt-plugs .. for her only to slide (!) the drawer back again, items flashed to the audience, never again referenced in this 'happy ever after' sequel.",

Would have maybe touched base with the psychiatrist as a character in the movie so you could truly understand how much emotional effort Christian is making to change for the better . I'm not quit sure why the critics are so harsh. Maybe they just don't understand the premise of this beautiful unique love story.

That's why if you ??Christian & Anastasia's love story then you will absolutely enjoy this movie. It went by fast, was a fun movie to see & like the books , I was sad it was over. I would even see it again . Def will purchase it when it comes out on DVD.",

The story was more powerful, but sometimes it made no sense, and it takes us to the things that were worse than the first one: The story sometimes made no sense. Like how Leila was really a slave to Christian? And how did she enter the apartment? A lot of nonsense things happened! Things I did not like in this movie are: Somehow the sex scenes were not erotic, and I hated that! It took everything in the novel without thinking. And the Unrated version was useless!

Back to my point the first film was a let down after much of the characters lacked development, walking in to this film I didn't expect all to much from it and then WHABAM! Our socks were knocked off, breath taken away, and yes very intreaged by the plot line and set design! This film did it for me, a hard core 50 shades Christian Grey fan. They finally figured out how to make the wonderful back store that the book has come to life to give it more meaning then just sex! Me and the girls will definitely be planning another girls night to watch this film, maybe this time we can pay more attention instead of swooning over the screen and gasping at the shockers they actually included!",

In days when almost every major film is about a super-hero, there comes this Erotic romantic tale about two different people who are willing to give anything just to be with each other. Dornan and Dakota are both very talented, and their background story is really interesting. I didn't find anything wrong with the film besides the obvious stuff. The film is just good for what it is. It's not an action movie, it's a romantic drama. It was well shot, well edited, has a great cinematography and cool cool cool soundtrack. Don't miss this one and don't listen to the hype.

And tonight, he is taking her to the ball and she will be the prettiest girl there. So, he bought her the bestest dress and real expensive jewelry. His old girlfriend showed up, but he said no, no, no, you go away. And he made her go away. The end.\" \nThe Drama:\nChristian's old girlfriend was stalking Anna. Finally, she cornered her and pulled out a gun and was ready to shoot her. But then Christian walked in the door and the \"drama\" was over.\nThe Survivor Story:\nChristian of course owns a helicopter and pilots it. He has engine trouble and apparently crashed it. It is such a national story that the News networks covered it live. Oh, Dear what happened to Christian is so important to the world, that everyone dropped everything. And yet, everyone in the audience had a problem caring in the slightest. Problem was we didn't see the plane crash or the aftermath. Then Christian walked in the door and the \"drama\" was over.\nThe porno:\nIts easy to make a porno. The porn industry cranks out several thousand every year. And the porn producers have no clue how to make a movie. And yet every porn movie is better than this one. The two principles are reasonably attractive. They have no interest in each other and it shows. There is an effort at Bondage sex, but its sort of like a TV sit-com version of bondage sex, in that there is really no sex. They raise the issue of bondage sex and then avoid doing anything sexy.\nSo there you have it. Four awful movies for the over-price of one.

The script and plots are written and thrown together in such a way that it seems like someone read the book and tried to write down some of those events for the script. Then they expected that you must have also read the book also so it will make sense to you. Newsflash. This movie is so poorly written and thrown together you won't have the first clue. The events are so far fetched when they a thrown in there that you can't being to take them seriously. Let's start with Christian Grey himself. He's supposedly around 21 and a billionaire. Even without talking, he doesn't even begin to be oozing power or importance when he walks into a room. And 21? I don't think so. Then we have Anastasia who is very unattractive and plain. Yet her boss corners her because he is just wanting to have sex with her \"so bad.\" If that wasn't enough they have the boss saying very cringy comments like, \"I can make you *** better than your bf can.\" LOL It was like something from a bad porn. Then she goes home and Christian has him fired. That's the end of it. All within a span of a minute. No build up to the event and not acknowledgement when a solution was found. Very insignificant presentation. If the writers didn't care that much about the event why should we?Then this weird chic breaks into her apartment who is Christian's ex. Again this scene only lasts a minute. No importance no real point other than it's just another event thrown in to take up some time. This events supposedly take place same day. lol Not buying it. Then Christian's helicopter goes down. Suddenly they are at his apartment worried and it's already on the news. After 30 seconds they announce he has been found and he walks into the door. Again this entire scene of events is a minute or two a most. In between all this you have some cringy sex scenes and some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Please at least make sure the actors have chemistry before putting them to bed together. It's awful. And yes I've seen tons of B movies. Was the director even there during filming? Even Kim Basinger's acting was horrendous like they did it all in one quick take without knowing the lines beforehand. It's just a bunch of B- acting, no chemistry characters, and random, unbelievable, and pointless events thrown together. I guess the real point is supposed to be their awkward relationship, but there is no dialogue really to support that only some bad sex scenes. The last movie started with him claiming he didn't want a relationship and then suddenly in this one he's changed his mind overnight with no hints, no warning, no dialogue? I've just never in all of my life seen something so random and cringy",

In the first movie I didn't feel chemistry between Ana and Christian. I felt that it was very awkward and cold. I also didn't think that the actors who were playing these roles really suited the characters that were portrayed in the books. But, with that being said, after watching the second one my opinion has slightly changed. This time around, I found that there was way more chemistry between Ana and Christian, it is very noticeable. Maybe it's all of the x-rated scenes they must endure together, but the shift between Ana and Christian is pleasing to watch. The acting is not as great. There were times where I found myself shaking my head or nodding in awkwardness as I watched the actors recite some phrases and thinking to myself why? Dakota Johnson is a great actress and you could really see her growth and potential in this movie. Jamie Dornan has a great body, but his acting was just OK. Better than the first, but still OK and at times- un Christian-like. It was sustainable, not awful. I think that the main issue with the movie is the terrible transitioning. Some parts of the film were a bit choppy where they would cut from scene to scene- this was most likely done because of time constraint but I think that for the third film they need to have a better way of cutting and jumping from each scene. I think that if I didn't read the novels I would have rated this higher. I went with a friend who has only made it to chapter 3 in the first book and she found the movie to be great- loved the drama and excitement that this movie gave, unlike the first and wants to go back again to watch it. Overall, the movie is not bad- could be better, but not waste of money bad. If you're a fan of the franchise I would recommend the watch, but if you're just someone who wants to watch a movie on a Saturday night just because, I'd say go for something else.",

I had one experience with soft BDSM in my life, and it was very similar to what Anastasia experience with mister Grey. I had that routine once, it was weird but pleasure. The movie had some surprising moments (the shot, the helicopter etc), i really didn't see it coming. I don't understand why some people are so offended from the film. it's definitely not anti-feminist. Anastasia is in a complete control over what's happening and she is not forced to do anything out of her own will. She is a free woman from beginning to end.

But a big part of this book/ movie, is not just about the sex and romance, but about Christians process. How he is at first, and how he develop personally. People are expecting this movie to be thrilling and other than just romance and sex. But when you haven't read the books, it's hard to see the big picture. I also think that's what they could have done better, they could have included his psychologist, so people so haven't read the books could get a climb of Greys thoughts. But people should read the books before watching the movie, then they can see that it is actually a really fun and great movie!",

The only disappointing part was that there were a little bit less sex scenes than expected.

He also let us know more about his past and how this affects his life today. Both Anastacia and the viewers fall in love with this new side of Christian.I give this movie a nine out of ten for hitting most of content from the book. It could have gotten ten out of ten if there were a little bit more of the sex scenes. If you were disappointed with the first movie, you should definitely give this movie a second chance.

The movie made Ana a much stronger character and Christian a much weaker character comparing to what's written in the books. The dynamic of the 2 in the books makes more sense, fresh out of college Ana suddenly fall into a life completely unknown. She's naturally unsure about things. Christian is more dominant as he has been in all things for over 8 years. Both are well read. In the books, Ana and Christian are on a journey of self discovery since they met. Both have been emotional throughout the journey. The movie did not reflect those.Dakota is the better actor of the 2, though it might has something to do with the script which is thin even though a large portion of the dialogues is from the books. Most of dialogues and emails in the books are very intelligent and fun despite many F words.",

I really LOVE Christian and Ana's relationship. I love seeing it evolve on the screen. I really enjoyed seeing more of Christian's turmoil and willingness to try to work on his \"mommy\" issues. I will say that the lipstick scene made me laugh out loud though. **Possible Spoilers below*** The movie wasn't exactly like the book, but touched on almost everything. I did not feel like I missed anything important from book. If I had to give one suggestion, I would have just said to add more in depth, longer scenes to the more important scenes. The scene where Christian \"submits\" to Ana was so emotional in the book. I would have loved to see MORE during that scene. It just didn't last long enough to give it the impact that it deserved. Never the less, though, the scene still made me gasp when it happened. I knew it was coming and it was still good, but could have been great if given a little more time.Anyways, good movie for the franchise IMO.",

So the movie looked very appearing and kept my interest.But that said it has a lot of obvious flaws to me aside from appearing to be a darker \"pretty woman\" and \"Cinderella story\". The plot seems too very far fetched to be believable to me. First there is the fact that this guy is so rich that he can get anything he wants and is used to getting what he wants, the fact he is controlling and secretive and involved in everything. Anastasia is mistrusting of this, but not near mistrusting enough, she tries to set boundaries which she doesn't keep and though that is not perhaps unusual though not very smart, it starts to look very unrealistic when criminal acts are done by people from Christian's past. And with the extreme sex, it seems obvious that they are both addicted to a fairy-tale which can not last or work this way in any real world, for the morality, trust, self-restraint and balance needed for this to work long term is virtually non-existent.I have to agree with a few other comments here, that Anastasia really does not seem very smart or experienced and seems to have gotten most things in her life relying on stronger men to give it to her. So while the movie may play well on many female fantasies, it also in many ways insults women with the naivety of the main character, who for me also becomes less likable because she is so gullible and goes along with almost anything her partner wants without much question. She even hands him excuses and offers him that he doesn't have to talk about things, though her condition for getting back with him was no secrets.Sure you can argue that flawless brainy people might make it tough to keep such a high suspense, since you have to invent smarter opposition, but it is just not very appealing to me to watch 2 hours of a little naive girl in a grown up body, being played around by this powerful rich manipulator who seems to own everything in her world.I think it is harsh to give this movie a rating lower than 3, for it was well made and never boring, but to be a great movie I would have hoped for either a bit more intelligent characters and plot, or at least some indication that the viewer was going along for the ride, at least to be introduced to some greater point to learn from. But there was too little of this. It seemed to me an attempt to explore the powerful attraction and fears which can be in relationships, without really having a deep enough insight to take it beyond the common theme of gullible girl seduced by rich control freak.Not a bad movie, but not a movie I would have desire to see again.",

The acting is much better with more chemistry. The music is great and it fits the scenes like a glove. The new look of Jamie is way hotter with that scruff and Ana's one is great too. Now a big WARNING FOR SPOILERS !!!!: I fell in love with all of scenes, they were well made without missing the essential elements of the story from the book. I loved the scene with Ana, Leila and Christian.. It was wonderful and how Leila knelt and the acting was very good but I wanted it to be longer even though I know they had to put many events with a limited time. The intimate scenes were very sexy and sensual with the suiting music, it was very beautiful. Now, what I didn't like was a part from the scene when Christian goes into the submissive mode and how Ana reacted, it was missing something.. I wanted more from him and her, more reactions and emotions. Apart from this it was just perfect for me as reader of the books. An advice for those who haven't watched it yet, never listen and judge before seeing it, give it a try and the decide. The movie is excellent and more than enough for the fans of the books.

Dornan is a very good actor, he portrays Christian in a very convincing way. I'm so sick and tired of the all latest blockbusters, how much more can we suffer from those childish super heroes films? Enough is enough, and we need to grow up. Many people assume that the movie is about the sex, no it is really not. The sex is a metaphor for Christian's problematic personality, and it's Anastasia's job to lead him the way to happy life. If you look carefully between the lines, this movie is really about him. The BDSM is kind of sick but what can i say, there are enough BDSM communities in the world to justify this weird sex. There's no abuse in this film, Anastasia is at 100% control the whole time. Don't let the media fool you, don't let those macho guys, Haters, Ego-based maniacs to tell you that the movie is bad. \"Fifty Shades Darker\" is a great film, it's nothing like what i've seen in the last couple of years in the cinema and i totally recommend it.",

It was bc of pure anger.***The point that got me FUMING was when, the night of being sexually assaulted at work, Ana's sipping wine in a cuddly bathrobe, not at all distressed or worried about what happened/her job LIKE WOMEN IN REAL LIFE WOULD. (she mentions wanting to work, breezily) How disrespectful of the writers/directors to all the women out there who've been through this and all the girls out there who one day will experience it. In the real world, WOMEN deal with $h!t, not their unicorn boyfriends - (who, for the record, stalked and pursued Ana AGAINST HER WILL until she was like 'fine ok'). It's one thing to be Hollywood-fairytale-esque, another to be offensive to all women who have to deal with patriarchal BS like sexual assault at work (often by themselves) and move on with their lives. #TimesUp",

A few cheesy tame sex scenes and a lot of the one-sided story-line. The reason I decided to go against giving this film a lower rating is for the development of some plot in the movie where Ana is confronted by various women of Christian's past.For that reason alone and the inclusion of Rita Ora in this franchise I have managed to up my rating.

It's is meant to provide simple escapism, a light titillating fantasy and is not trying to be an epic, deep film full of luvvies out doing each other to land an Oscar! The movie was amusing at times and had quite a few scenes which were very easy on the eye. The group of friends I watched the film with all felt it to be better than the last offering and all enjoyed the experience. As you would expect the screening we attended was an all female affair which isn't surprising. I have to say what has surprised me is the amount of negative reviews here from people who apparently didn't like the first movie at all, so they went to see the second?!! If you didn't like it last time why on earth did they expect it to be more deep and meaningful this time? Do they not know what the story entails? Maybe they should refrain from viewing the third film.....a little tip here ...Fifty shades Freed is more of the same kind f thing! Life is too short if it's not your thing so maybe give it a miss. I for one look forward to watching it.",

In this movie we find out more about Christians past and he starts opening up to her more, it's not about the sex in this movie, it's about the love they have for each other and their relationship. Yes there are still hurdles in their relationship but that does not stop them from being together.

(I'm leaning towards bad right now).The movie did not follow the book; they combined many scenes into one sequence, then again on others. This also happened in the first movie, and I know the screenwriters need to consolidate things from a book, but really! Why did they make it feel so rushed? I mean- REALLY RUSHED. And CHOPPY. I have been to plenty of movies of the same length that felt so much more cohesive than this- it's almost hard to describe. It was like there was one 5 second scene from one part in the book, then seconds later Ana and Christian are somehow transported to the next scene in the book, 5 seconds of that, and then the next scene- through the entire movie. Nothing felt smooth or seemed to make sense. I actually think there was more dialog in the first film. There were parts of the book that had more feeling and connection. The scenes that should have been given weight to them did not have that, so that even when love is professed, you wouldn't know it to watch the movie.(As in- wait- did they just have a big moment in their relationship??)Trivia note: I did notice that Dakota used a scene from her mom when she was in the movie \"Working Girl.\" I just happened to see that movie recently and noticed the scene where Ana is taking Jack's place and talks to her administrative assistant; the assistant asks her what she should call Ana now. The next lines are the same as her mom's from when she met her new assistant.The new characters are not explored at all and Kate's brother Ethan does not even show up as a character in this movie. Overall, I was really disappointed in how choppy and rushed the whole movie seemed. I would gladly have sat in the theater for 20-30 minutes longer if it meant that we got to see better character development. The book's dialog is terrible too, but at least there was a feeling that there was a connection between Ana and Christian. I wasn't expecting an Oscar winner going in to the theater- just an entertaining 2 hours, but wow- I left feeling like I wasn't even entertained. And since they have already filmed, and I guess edited, the third film, I'm not sure reviewing this even matters. Hopefully the editing will leave the scenes longer than a couple of minutes a piece.",

But this sequel is everything the first film was accused of by most users: flat characters, shallow, not credible, unsexy, booooooring and predictable. There is no build-up to the re-connecting of Christian and Anasasia, he just buys the company she works for and they're together again. Her boss is unbelievably jealous and I have no idea why is interested in Anastasia. Her promotion is ridiculous. Meeting 'Mrs Robinson\" is like a scene from the worst television soap opera and seems to build up to Anastia''s boss and her getting together to plot the downfall of Christian and Anastasia - perhaps a crime/horror film can be made of that but I will not watch it. I have no idea why Christian proposes to Anastasia, why does he want to marry her? What kind of marriage will that be like? it is totally out of character. Unless he locks her up in a play room for the rest of her life for him to do with as he pleases. This film is cringingly bad and cures me completely of any desire to watch number trhee.",

I have to admit - i was 100% wrong. the movie was great! first of all, you can't ignore the cinematography, the landscapes, the beautiful production. Secondly, i really loved the two main characters. I saw dakota johnson in another film last year and she was charming and cute as hell. The actor, Dornan, is an interesting guy. Their love story is unique and special, and doesn't resemble anything else i've seen in cinema over the last few years. I'm really fed up with all these super-hero trash that dominant the box office. It's time for a different kind of dominant if you know what i mean :) 'Fifty shades darker' is a fantastic film, very misunderstood for some,but i guess it's the right film for the right people.

They all had like 5-10 min on screen at best (angry boss/psycho ex/ old Grammy porn hub). But those scenes whit those characters the build up is OK it would be a mediocre movie a meh movie at best (giving some quite OK sex scenes)..... but then comes the most retarded part of the movie and that is pam pam pam the helicoper crash. Who is Christian the child of Superman and Batman also his assistant . Both of them survived a crash that also in the trailers was presented differently from the movie. Cuz in the trailers you can see the helicopter hiting the ground but in the movie they cut it because even they realize how retarded it was.

I overall thought that this movie was great. It was a thriller/romance/slight comedy all in one. There were scenes that made the crowd gasp; Leila pulling the trigger and Christian almost dying in that plane crash created suspense within the film. In terms of comedy, there were lines that Anastasia said that gave the audience a giggle (i.e. silver balls scene). And for those saying that they don't have chemistry.. are you kidding? Maybe it's just me but I sometimes wonder how they don't develop feelings while shooting this movie. It may be acting but the feelings they portray seem so real. This movie is definitely unpredictable. You can't really predict what will happen in Fifty Shades Freed; obviously Jack Hyde will seek revenge, but what about Leila? Will she also seek revenge? Mrs. Robinson? Also, that slapping scene with Mrs. Robinson was a great way to satisfy the audience. I wanted to slap her the second I saw her in that beauty salon. It was a superb film. Watched it many times because of the unique love story and chemistry Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan portray in this film. Can't wait for Fifty Shades Freed.",

The movie is a reminder that you can't force your own personal desires on someone else. This is the most feminist and anti- abusive film I've ever seen in my life. I think that the cast did a really good job, i mean the acting is really good and the story itself is very original. Most films today are pretty much crap. The super hero films are just a cash grab to make money, it's been a while since we've seen a different concept dominants the box office. I'm really glad that the last chapter will be released next year, i try not to read spoilers but I've heard it has a very interesting ending. The world need more films like 'Fifty Shades Of Grey\".

So I will start out with the good. I'll just say SPOILER ALERT!! In case I give anything away so here we go.GOOD: The story and the acting was better. I say that because I felt that while Dakota Johnson did well in the first one I felt Jamie Dornan's was a little stiff at times in the first one. I thought his acting was better in this one and Dakota did a good job in this one as well. I thought they did a good job with the story involving Leila and Jack Hyde and that the actors playing them did a good job as well. They also made sure to add some good key moments from the book into the movie. The scene with him working out...nice!THE BAD: They could of did a better job of editing. The transition from one scene to another was not always the best. I also felt and SPOILER ALERT!! I felt like they left a moment out that would have those who did not read the books understand a little more why he doesn't like to be touched. I think the audience got some idea of just how hard it is to have someone touch him on certain area's of his body during the lipstick scene but I still would have liked to see a little more dialogue happen between Christian and Ana on that subject but they may elaborate on it more once Fifty Shades Freed come out (fingers crossed). I felt that they had Kim Basinger looking a little sloppy especially during the Masquerade Ball. For anyone who read the books Elena's character was described as looking sexy and elegant. The had her looking like a waitstaff during the Ball. I felt the scene where Christian let Ana touch him was a little rushed. The way he played the scene when she was using the lipstick should have been played the same way when he finally let her touch him. I also felt like the scene when he was missing could have been longer as well. I also felt like some of the love scenes were a bit cheesy...although I did like the one when he introduced her to the silver balls. I thought Dakota did a pretty amusing job in that scene.Despite the bad I still enjoyed the movie and the love story that is Ana and Christian.",

            "content": "I saw Fifty Shades of Grey the day it was released in theaters. I then bought the DVD so I could watch it at my leisure. It wasn't any better on DVD. I am going to list the main things I found wrong with Grey and compare that to Darker, in this mere viewer's opinion. Let's begin with: Casting: In my opinion casting can make or break a film. It was the first fatal flaw with Grey. Virtually none of the actors matched - in any way - the books' descriptions of the characters they played. Jamie Dornan is good looking (I prefer him without the facial hair), but he is nowhere close to matching the books' description of Christian Grey. To list a few of the differences, Christian was described as a tall, drop-dead-gorgeous man whose hair simply would not lie down. A man who would not have sex without wearing a shirt to be sure he was not touched. Ana was described as young (22), beautiful, and intelligent. I simply did not see Dakota Johnson as a woman who would make Christian Grey go to a hardware store just to see her again. She was bad wrong for this part. I could go on, but won't; Acting: Awful, awful, awful - enough said? Dornan & Johnson were stiff when acting in the same scene. They appeared to be biding their time until they could get away from each other. The sex scenes were unrealistic, even for \"vanilla\" sex, not to mention the sex was supposed to be rough because that was how Christian liked it. Also, my mother spanked me and my siblings when we were growing up and disobeyed, I just wish she had spanked me as hard as Christian \"spanked\" Ana. I realize one actor can't beat another actor, but those spankings weren't even good acting;Script: The script of Grey was so poorly done that those of us who had read the book had difficulty finding the book in the film. There were so many places when the scenes in the book would have worked much better than what the script portrayed. A lot of the script wasn't even in the book; and Set design: This was so wrong in so many ways. I realize a particular location can't always be found that accurately depicts the location in the book, such as the Greys' house. But there are things that can be done correctly. In the book, there was an L-shaped, white couch in Christian Grey's office where Ana interviewed him, and a u-shaped white couch in his living room, they were both missing. In the film, instead of sitting between the sofa and coffee table, onto which Ana dropped her tape recorder, she sat stiffly in a straight chair using a pencil he handed her.Now for Darker: Casting: The only improvement in this book was the first scene with Leila in it. She looked accurate when we see her outside of Ana's office; Acting: No improvement, still the same people who relate poorly to each other; Script: The reason I gave this film 3 stars is because the script writing was more faithful to the book, but it was still a long way from being on target. There were some scenes that were shown in reverse, the one I will mention is the helicopter scene. Then some scenes were ruined for no reason whatsoever, for example, when Leila confronts Ana outside her office building the scene is ruined when Jack comes out of the building and whisks Ana away to the bar - which was not named Fifty's and where it was just the two of them and not 6 or 7 of them, like in the book; then when Leila confronts Ana in her apartment, why do they have her fire the gun she is carrying, that didn't happen in the book, wasn't necessary in the film. Also there was one scene in the book I felt was pivotal to the entire story and it was completely left out of the film. On Christian's birthday, Ana has three gifts for him, the key chain, a model helicopter, and a box containing items she has taken from the red room. They go into the red room and he \"uses\" the items she has selected on her - on the table, not on the bed. Then comes the scene that, in my opinion, sums up the entire story (all three books). Christian picks Ana up from the table, lays her on the bed, and begins playing The First Time Even I Saw Your Face by Roberta Flack. With that song as the background, he makes love to her, contrary to how he described the kind of sex he has. When reading the books, I kept waiting for this song to come into play because I felt it accurately depicted their first meeting and subsequent relationship, and wasn't disappointed when it was played in this scene. But, this very important part of the book was left completely out of the film. I'm hoping the only reason is because they couldn't get the rights to use it.Set design: Same old same old.In my opinion, Darker is only marginally better than Grey. Perhaps Freed will finally get it right, although I doubt it because Darker and Freed were filmed back to back.",

As focus was placed on the sex scenes: wrong interpretation of good vs rude sexual interaction!!! Lack of imagination and link between scenes sexual or non-sexual ones!

So let me correct some things that the movie missed or messed up. After their break-up Ana was devastated and was not eating properly. Christian had purchased SIP before Ana had drinks with her co -workers. Kate's brother comes to town for a visit so Ana gives him her key. When Ana gets home she is buzzed in only to walk in the door to Lelia holding the gun. Ana hits a bar across the street with Kate's brother. My favorite scene in book 2 was where Christian panics thinking Ana is going to leave him again he falls to his knees. Ana not understanding asks what is he doing a few times before telling him to look at her and he does. The movie really really missed the emotion in these scenes. The news covers the story of the missing helicopter but does not announce Christian was alive. Ana was disgusted that Elena started a sexual relationship with Christian when he was so young. Dr. Grey slaps Elena before telling her to get out of her house. Elena was not bold enough to deliberately drop a towel in rebellion before walking off in the book.I hope everyone involved in the 3rd movie reads the book at least twice before filming.",

Those just aren't things that translate well to the screen as they are so difficult to capture... most apparently when the chemistry isn't there and the chosen actors cannot adequately do remote justice to the original characters. I almost didn't watch these movies, but ultimately decided to give them a try. I wish I hadn't! The first one was just a horrible letdown and the first five minutes I watched of the second one was just worse. Why would they change so much from the books? I can't with the bad acting, the poor choice in actors (both with how they compared in looks to the original character descriptors and how they acted on screen, as well as their complete lack in chemistry) and terribly disappointed with the story line! 10/10 do not recommend.",

I think FSoG was better in the aspect to take it a bit more \"serious\" than FSD. This film completely did not give a f*ck, I was disappointed that the plots and other characters (Mrs. Robinson, Jack Hyde, Leila) were weak! It had potential to explore more of these arcs, but it didn't. It was dull and so rushed! Everything was rushed. Even the sex! I'm not expecting full-blown porn but cut the soundtrack songs out, more positions (not just mostly missionary all the time), and please bring in some foreplay. How can a movie about risqu\u00e9 intimacy not show good foreplay? Why does Christian always have an un-emotional face while having sex? No climax either? In the books, wasn't he always grinning (or proudly smiling) for his accomplishment in giving Ana orgasms? For getting off too? None of that...it cuts straight to the next scene. Man...and why was it so Soap-Opera-ish?\n\nI'm not going to lie, I read the trilogy once and I was like, \"whatever, this is the junk food to my brain\". It wasn't good, but whatever... it served some purpose. Did I think that it was the greatest love story? Nope. Did I think it was a great romantic story? Nope. I was honestly intrigued by the fetish that surrounds BDSM. But it turned out, that even if the sex was hot, it wasn't even portrayed properly. BDSM is a whole other level.\n\nI was walking out and a lot of the viewers said that it did poorly in capturing the book. Like sure, the sex was there, but that connectivity...intimacy... was not. It was like : fight, bang (sex). Argument, bang. Present, bang again. It was repetitive in the sense of just make-up sex all the time. Ana is annoying. She doesn't know what she wants in the film or in life. Its like she can't take Christian's dark ways and not kidding, a few seconds later she's okay with it, without any solidifying reason (unless its going down on her or sex) . I feel like FSoG (2015) attempted some direction towards a woman's viewpoint. Like Ana being \"dominant\" in the sense of negotiation and choices. In this film, I'm sorry...she comes off like a gold-digger. She comes off like the only reason she's with him is because he's rich. Its like \"I can't be with you, like this...(he gives her a gift), oh, I love you!) WTF? She tries so hard to be her own woman, but really ends up being Christian's (and not in the cute way like \"Oh, I'm his girl *googly-eyes*) I feel that FSoG (2015) did a better job in where Ana had control and it made sense. Here it's wishy-washy.\n\nIts just a mess, not sexy, everything is rushed that you don't understand the reasoning behind motives. They cut off and rushed great moments and characters that could have given the film more sense, romance and great eroticism. Yes its funny because it tries so hard to take itself serious. But that's about it.",

            "content": "Yes, it's terrible, but it's also laughable. In many ways, Fifty Shades Darker is worse than the first film, particularly the writing. Though the chemistry between Johnson and Dornan has improved, the movie has also completely removed all the dramatic stakes that the first film had. In the first film, the couples wanted to be together despite their incompatibility and ultimately separated because of their differences. In Fifty Shades Darker, their differences are resolved very early in the movie, so there's no need to root for them for the rest of the film.\n\nThough it's great to see a couple in a healthy relationship, it also makes for a really uninteresting movie, especially when you don't care about any of the characters. Anastasia's little personality that she had in the first film is now stripped away as she conforms herself to Christian Grey, who (despite giving up his BDSM lifestyle to be with Anastasia) is still the same manipulative control freak that he was in the first film.\n\nAnastasia doesn't know what she wants in this movie. First, she tells him she wants to take it slow after they got back together, and then they have sex in the same scene. She's also very nostalgic about the red room. \n\nThere's a scene that bothered me where Christian Grey transfers $24,000 into Anastasia's bank account after they had sex (the same sex scene described in the last paragraph). In the next scene, they're at a coffee shop and Christian invites Anastasia to a ball, but she tells him she doesn't have the dress for it. Bitch, he just gave you $24,000! Don't tell him you don't have a dress for the ball when he gave you $24,000.\n\nEvery men in Fifty Shades Darker are all creepy. For some reason, Jose is back (the guy who forced himself onto Anastasia in the previous film) and Anastasia is still friends with him. My favourite character in the move is Anastasia's sexually harassing boss named Jack (played by Eric Johnson), who gets instantly jealous when he sees Anastasia with Christian Grey, and also tried to force himself onto her. His character was ridiculously over-the-top and hilarious. I think Fifty Shades Darker is the only film where I found sexual harassment funny. I hope Eric Johnson gets more screen time in Freed as he's the only reason why I have an iota of interest in the next film. Sexual harassment is obviously no laughing matter, but it's impossible to take Fifty Shades Darker seriously as there are many pointless subplots in the film. There are flashbacks of Grey being abused as a child, a subplot involving his ex-girlfriend who's jealous of Anastasia, and a helicopter crash where Grey miraculously survives. \n\nFifty Shades Darker was also written by E. L. James's husband, Niall Leonard. Kelly Marcel and Sam Taylor-Johnson (writer and director of the first film) at least tried to subvert the ridiculousness of the source material. There was no doubt that creative differences led to the change in the creative team, and I knew this change would make the movie worse. Niall Leonard and director James Foley will, unfortunately, return for the third and final film.\n\nThough Fifty Shades Darker is worse than the first film, I enjoyed it more because of it. It's the best comedy of 2017 next to The Bye Bye Man. Even if you didn't like the first film, I would still recommend Fifty Shades Darker to those who enjoy terrible movies.",

I must say though that my opinion is quite positive. I found Fifty Shades Darker to be an enjoyable movie. I started this film with the question \"How am I going to watch this for two hours?\" but it ended before I realised it.\n\nFirst off, let me say, I am a sucker for all things romantic and I think the Fifty Shades movies are that as well. It's all quite a cliche (another thing that I love) and in some cases that comes with a not so great storyline. Fifty Shades Darker is one of those cases. What made this movie an good movie, in my opinion, are the actors and the camera work. The only actress that was a bit of a disappointment for me was Dakota Johnson. She was a great Ana in the first film but I feel like she decided to put a lot more of herself into Ana which kind of bothered me. I was pleasantly surprised by Eric Johnson, whom I've only seen in Hallmark movies. Jamie Dornan is always great so, don't have much more to add to that, ha. The camera work and all the sets were great tho. Grey's apartment, I mean, yas.\n\nYup. I enjoyed it and I'm probably gonna watch it again someday. #noshame",

I would be lying if I said I'd walked in with high expectations for this \"film\". Look, I saw the first one and it made me barf inside my own soul. But this one takes atrocious to a whole new level. I consider myself a positivist when it comes to movies but there are not many redeemable qualities about this washed up sequel. Firstly, the trailers made it look like a Eyes Wide Shut kind of movie, clearly hinting at a secret society of some sorts which is never even grazed on. Secondly, going from both a female director and screenwriter to male \"filmmakers\" was a lunatic decision! The direction is astoundingly deficient, and it's topped by any celebrities' sex tape; the editing is bizarre and the script... the script is something out of this world! I do realize that much of the fault can be attributed to that senseless women E. L. James' source material but the script has no idea of how humans interact and what's behind characters' decision. Watching Christian and Anastasia talking is as awkward as that time you first tried role playing, but this time there's no happy ending. There's so much in this \"film\" that is laughable and unbearable that I often found refuge in checking if that Exit sign was still there. What's more, the sex scenes weren't even exciting! It felt like the whole movie was constructed around them, as they don't seem to communicate with the scenes that come before or after them. The sex was so boring and misplaced and made two attractive people feel like they were taken off Battleship Earth. Furthermore, the performances are shocking, what is that? The lack of life, intonation and nuance from both actors should trigger a mechanism for them to be expelled from Hollywood. Trump, take notice! These \"filmmakers\" and actors are the ones you should be deporting!\nBut wait, there's more! And this one is a biggie. What's more infuriating about this sequel is that it is incredibly misogynistic. It's off the wall when a movie that's so clearly marketed to women is also deeply degrading to them. First, no one and I say no one would come back to him time and time again, no matter how cute the puppy eyes and second, it's the 21st century and, guess what, you don't need a man to make it through life. This film reinforces so many stereotypes like the notion that the woman should be submissive in bed and in the relationship, that conversation is mediated by the man, that the women can't protect themselves from the harsh world out there and that objectification is acceptable. And yet, to try to compensate this, Anastasia says \"no, I order for myself\" and \"no, I don't want you anymore\" and \"ew, my boss wants to rape me\" because god forbid there's a man that doesn't want to have sex with white bread Dakota. To all women out there, if you go watching this film with your boyfriend or girl friends, you are encouraging the perpetuation of resolute gender roles in our society, you're giving the man the power to choose for you and you're allowing misogyny to grow. This film represents everything that's wrong with mass female-targeted entertainment and it's like what a straight guy thinks being screwed in the butt feels like.",

Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson give off the most uninteresting love story I've seen in quite a while and it lacks any sort of actual love, charisma, or personality to it. It was just rubbish to watch unfold and I have seen better sex scenes in PG-13 movies than in this R rated film. The dialogue was also just completely terrible and I found myself sighing in annoyance with the worst lines and laughing at the most serious moments. From what I heard about the books, they were also horribly written and I can't imagine those being worse than the movies. There is no weight to the film it's completely dull in every sense, the director James Foley of the really good Glengarry Glen Ross directs the film awfully making it one of the most boring films I had ever seen, and gifted composer Danny Elfman creates his most by-the-numbers music in these movies. When the movie maybe presents something that could be interesting, it is thrown to the wayside to show more boring ass scenes of more romancing, kissing, and sex. Great actresses like Kim Basinger and Marcia Gay Harden are wasted in forgettable and useless roles. Overall, this is the second time in a row that these stars and filmmakers have crafted something completely awful and I do not look forward to what they have in store for the hopefully final chapter in Fifty Shades Freed.",

            "content": "There's a particular adage describing how the certain solid material looks of the top of the septic tank. This is a crude analogy to use about a movie, but in this instance, the consensus is accepted. The movie represented by the waste material in this comparison is 'Fifty Shades Darker,' the second in a trilogy of the movie adaptation of the best-selling novels written by E. L. James. Audiences around the world have already been afflicted with the opening salvo on this front, good taste 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' and undoubtedly have 'Fifty Shades Freed,' in the foreseeable future. Some may understandably wonder how it will be so universally panned by critics could be assured filling out a complete trilogy of movies. The movie of the consideration at an estimated budget of some $55 million over most of it was recouped on opening night eventually starting to well over double the investment without even considering income derived from Blu-ray/DVD and cable licensing fees. Unless you've been living in a pop-culture free environment for the last two years you undoubtedly aware of the fundamental plot of the series of movies, and perhaps a specific focus of the second film. The story follows a rather na\u00efve young woman drawn into the influence of a man who is wealthy and powerful and also quite into the sexual practice known as BDSM, a.k.a. Bondage, discipline, sadomasochism. In the first story, the powerful man in the designated damsel restricts their pursuit of fetishism to the bedroom. Now, take the show on the road and explore various establishments and groups with devotees of the practice and gathered together. Since the subject matter so overly sexualized it would be a completely natural conclusion to expect a substantial amount of nudity. Right up front, it should be noted that only an estimated 9% of the film is over sexual content. That's less than 12 minutes of a running time of the 118 minutes. Back when I was a kid, long before the age of the Internet, you check the Catholic newspaper, The Tablet, for films listed as condemned by the Church. They were the ones we would inevitably try to see the next weekend. Even by the puerile standards of the 60s, teenage boys would be disappointed in the eroticism of this movie.\n\nThis story moves directly into some of the psychological and emotional influences that help shape the sexual predilections of Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). After breaking up with his girlfriend, the enigmatic Mr. Grey begins experiencing intense nightmares forcing him to revisit the abuse he suffered as a child. Meanwhile, his former liaison, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is moving on with her life including a new job as an assistant for an editor at Seattle Independent Publishing, Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson). Since this story is ostensibly a romance, albeit a very unorthodox variation, it should come as no surprise that Mr. Hyde is interested in Ana. Initially, the dramatic motivation was whether or not Ana was given to the seductive Mr. Grey. In an attempt to change the underlying narrative reflects a slightly different direction; Christian now has a romantic rival adding to his concerns. Even the worst movies can contain a few aspects properly handled. To the credit of the screenwriter, Niall Leonard, the time is wasted to reunite Mr. Grey and Ms. Steele. Ana was attending an art gallery show featuring a friend of hers, Jose Rodriguez' (Victor Rasuk). Among the other guests she happens to spot Christian Grey, and after a bit small talk, she reluctantly agrees to go to dinner with him. Any reasonable person would hear his voice in the back of the head screaming while watching this point of the film, which after everything that happened in the previous movie why would she risks falling back into the same routine. The answer is quite simple. If she declined the invitation, the movie would probably qualify as a short. It is the most blatant of plot contrivances but considering the overall quality and veracity of the story any complaints would be meaningless. Christian does make the requisite plea to accept his offer by stating that he has changed. If you saw this in the theater and happened to look around at this moment, you undoubtedly see every woman's head nodding in disbelief.\n\nThe movie proceeds to construct an overly convoluted tangle of interrelationships. Ana encounters a woman who looks strikingly similar to her later when she's having drinks with Jack; conveniently Christian is there as well. When he witnesses Jack's Cretaceous attitude towards Ana, he abruptly leaves taking Ana with him explaining that her boss at less than honorable intentions but is not so innocent flirting. Christian explains to her that this company has been seriously considering taking over SIP. That would ensure that Christian would not be out of Ana's life anytime soon. He also revealed her that the woman she saw him with that look similar to her was Leila Williams, portrayed by Jazmine Campanale, Ms. Johnson's stand-in. He explained that she was one of his former submissiveness demonstrating that he obviously has a particular physical type that he finds attractive. To infuse a modicum of suspense into the proceedings, Christian provides a bit of the woman's back story. After leaving him, she got married, but recently her husband died. Since then she has taken upon herself to stalk Ana and Christian.\n\nIf it weren't for the fact that Christian was a man, this tale of his scarring childhood would be consistent with a Lifetime movie. His mother was a prostitute addicted to crack in his birth mother committed suicide. As a child, he was taken in by Grace Trevelyan Grey (Marcia Gay Harden), who eventually adopted him. Later on, Ana meets a woman Christians past, Elena Lincoln (Kim Basinger), who is Christian's business partner and former dominant. To keep things, spicy turns out the Christian life to be not just on the giving side of S&M at the receiving side as well. The big scene that dominated the trailers is the BDSM masquerade ball. The setting, obviously inspired by the central sexual intrigue for Stanley Kubrick's final film, 'Eyes Wide Shut.' I always enjoy a movie that requires the audience to devote their attention to the storyline. It is exciting to see various threads of the story become woven together as the narrative progresses. Instead of individual threads of a beautiful tapestry, the elaborate nature of the story closely resembles a tango Christmas tree lights when you retrieve them from storage in December. Just as that inexorable morass of wires and bulbs promised to be something special, the only thing that provided is frustration, disillusionment, and disappointment.\n\nObviously, there is a fan base for this series of movies is evident not only by the box office success despite being dismissed by critics but also the best-selling status of the novels. The main difference between the three books in the franchise and the Pope Romance novels so popular for women to read on the beach that the 'Shades of Grey' stories were published in hardcover conferring upon them a semblance of literary worth. I happen to agree with what many people have noted that if you want to watch an erotic drama, you will find more success watching Cinemax After-Hours than anything this movie can offer. The movie is available in Ultra high definition, 4K, in case you are inclined to spend even more to have the video as sharp as currently available.",

            "content": "Darker by named but not necessarily by nature, the follow up to Fifty Shades Of Grey manages to be far more complicated than its predecessor, but somehow ends up being just as dull. The acting, especially from the lead couple, hasn't improved, the writing isn't any more insightful or less laughable, and the plot isn't any less repetitive. You could play a drinking game while watching it and do a shot for every time Christian steps out of a black SUV, every time he and Ana attend a fancy party, every time they text each other, every time they sleep together and every time a question is asked that either never gets answered or simply leads to more questions. The first movie's biggest sin was that it was boring, and this one, while still having its sporadically interesting moments, also can't disguise the blatant flaws of its source material. Why does Ana do such a quick U-turn when it comes to how she feels about Christian? One minute she wants nothing to do with him, then she can't stand to be away from him for a second? And why is Christian so able to completely give up the only life he's known because of a single person he has nothing in common with? It's completely nonsensical, and a cheap excuse to film a series of sex scenes which don't even, ahem, climax, instead just ending with a jump cut to a completely location. It has no reason to be nearly 2 hours long, but manages to pad itself out with a helicopter crash of all things, and one in which nobody suffers more than superficial injuries. It's like even the movie had no idea where to go and panicked when it realised there was still time left to fill. Mercifully there's only 1 film left, and while it might be the best in the trilogy, that is a very low bar to clear.",

I have watched it many times since it's release both in the theater and, by DVD...\nAnd each time one scene comes into play, my heart speeds up because, in my mind, I know how the scene is supposed to play out and then... I cringe.\nI know it is coming. I know the same results are going to happen each time but, my mind, knowing the books, knowing how the director -should- have directed Jamie to perform... I have this pain in my soul because Jamie is a great actor. I just think this was not the right part for him.\nI can forgive that the movie didn't really follow the book. So that was a let down from the start however, the idea is there, and so I can forgive that but, as a fan of the book... yes, I can hear your collective groans, I really had high hopes after seeing Jamie cast as this character until... that.. one.. scene.\n\nThe scene... spoiler(ish) alert.\n\nAnna has just come back from her \"walk\" after the Lyla incident.\nChristain and Anna are having it out over whether or not Anna can fullfill his needs, and Christain, being afraid that Anna is leaving him, submits to her, by kneeling in front of her.\nIn the movie, this is all done with barely any feeling, and so nonchalantly, I honestly wondered if either Jamie or the director had bothered to read the series or not.\nIn the book.. Christain is panicked. He is scared. His emotions, which he has no experience dealing with, are flying all over the place! His heart is breaking into a million pieces, and he feels like he is losing everything, all because he, in his mind, is a monster, one which Anna could never love.\nThat raw emotion. In the books, he is fighting, arguing, crying, begging. \nHe is completely NOT himself. And suddenly. It all stops, and he throws himself down on his knees. Completely submission. Docile. \nThat pain, and emotion, and loss... Jamie just doesn't deliver it.\nThe thing is, with the proper direction, he could have gotten there!!!\nThis is something that bothers me with many directors.\nIt's THEIR JOB to get the correct response from their actors.\nThere are so many scenes from both movies that I could dissect like this... however, this was the most disappointing scene in ALL of the movies Jamie Dornan has been in.\nIt honestly makes me so angry when I see an actor's potential hidden, and screwed with like this.\nAs for my mental and almost physical response to this scene... as I said, I am a fan of the series. Sure it's about D/S relationships but, that is not what I got from the series. There was so much more than just sex. And, I tend to lose myself in books. If I can connect with the characters than I feel that is a great experience with the authors. I find it a disservice to the author, as well as the actors.\nThis could have been an amazing movie, if the actors had just had a better more attentive director.\nAnd, just to point out, I am not saying that maybe the director hasn't had other hits... to be honest, I didn't look into it because of this epic fail at directing THIS film... but, I think that the director failed this movie. \nSigh... that is all I will say. For now. Hey, there is another movie still to come. See you all then!",

So I doubt anybody will be bored of it, which means watchable film and instead it won't be their favourite.\n\nThe story continued and this time it was not based on experiment or any kind of agreement, but mutual understanding. So the billionaire Grey and Ana's erotic adventure sustains. With the small-small developments the film goes all the way to the ending. That means, those who are watching it for the selected scenes, will surely would have a nice time. But nothing was strong as any European film on the similar theme.\n\nApart from the weak storyline, there's nothing wrong with it. As to what this film is about, it served better. That's what I say to you not to expect full storied romance-drama. As usual the actors were good and another two films to come in the 'Fifty Shades' franchise. I hope they can be better than the first two. Overall, it is only for the selected audience, but curiosity makes everybody watch it and they all pour they perspective which is flooded with average to negative. Otherwise, it is an acceptable film.\n\n6/10",

It's length transcends time. The film itself is a measurement of meaningless length that has yet to be defined by mankind, with pockets of absolute drowning nothingness thrown in for sure. Performances are horrible, yet both leads have a clear warm chemistry which makes it all the more disjointed in a script that treats itself and its audience like feces at the bottom of your shoe. It's editing and structure is also horrifyingly off, with a random and irrelevant action sequence that should have never seen the light of day.",

Oh and not to mention characters popping in and out mixed with terrible acting. You might think I'm talking about a porno I saw, but unfortunately most porno's have more of a plot than this film. Strangely enough I thought the first film Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) was decent. Not a movie I would see again, but it wasn't super controversial like they were advertising it. This movie takes the plot of that film (which was thin to begin with) and then hits us with some shit for the next two hours. Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is still reeling from her relationship with Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Then five minutes into the film they get back together. Wow. Just. Like. That. Truthfully there isn't much more to the film. We get some background on Christian. We learn about his first lady friend Elena (Kim Basinger). We learn that he's crazy as hell and controlling. And we learn that Dakota Johnson can't act to save her damn life. Full of some terrible sex scenes (Christian wearing pants the whole time eh?) this film just misses the mark. It's obviously setting up the final film Fifty Shades Freed (2018), but there's so much that doesn't happen in this movie that the pacing gets hurt big time with loads of time where we get some scenes with Ana just kinda talking...not moving plot at all. Overall, I'm not the target audience for this one. This is a film to avoid at all costs. It seriously only gets on star since the soundtrack is fire though.",

Bring in the re'writers.\" And in places the screen activity is just embarrassing - for the male viewers watching a clutz (with cash) and a pretty, shapely, willing girl - & for the actors performing on camera. But, as the Credits teaser vignette shows, it's still going to end with the marriage fairy tale, the woman having saved the man who was head-screwed from birth by mothers & other women.

She trying to accept his kinky side, but likewise, it is new to her.  This sequel is all about them furthering their relationship while trying to weather previous lovers popping back into Christian's life.  At this point, everybody knows why this series was written: it is socially acceptable smut for bored housewives because it is in the form of a book.  I will straight up tell you that I've never read this book series, and will likely never do so for a number of different reasons, but a movie, I can handle, because it is done and over in two hours.  The first movie was pretty tame all things considered, and for what it's worth, this movie does up the ante to the next level.  Now don't get me wrong, this is still a bad movie that is chock filled with problems.  There's glaring issues that don't make sense from a logical standpoint.  For one, this is a girl that perpetually has three to four guys fighting for affection.  Don't get me wrong, Dakota Johnson is a pretty enough actress, but she just doesn't have that x-factor.  Her character is written to be homely and plain, and it never makes sense on just why she is the apple of the eye of so many suitors.  Then there is Christian, who is just a book of complexes.  He's an overprotective control freak and just Batmans into a scene with the quickness, so much so that it is alarming.  I mean really, all you have to do is change the soundtrack to something like John Carpenter's Halloween and you could completely change the entire movie... but that would never happen, because they've got their own soundtrack to sell here.  This is still Twilight fan-fiction, and you can always see the shaky foundation that this was built on.  It is sillier, but at the same time, it is sexier, so if that is why you are watching it, you're going to get your fix (I can't imagine any other possible reason for watching this).  I still feel like this movie would be better if it just went for it, and because the acting is marginally better than The Room, this series is never ever going to reach the realm of being so bad it's good.  At the end of the day, the entire reason why you would watch this would be the same if you were to watch a soft-core porno, except that would be a more earnest and efficient use of your time.",

And that ending... her disgruntled ex-boss planning revenge with his weird, statutory rapist and they're getting married?  Come on.  That's just too good.

            "content": "Yes, it's terrible, but it's also laughable. In some ways, Fifty Shades Darker is worse than the first film, particularly the writing. Though the chemistry between Johnson and Dornan has improved, the movie has also completely removed all the dramatic stakes that the first film had. In the first film, the couples wanted to be together despite their incompatibility and ultimately separated because of their differences. In Fifty Shades Darker, their differences are resolved very early in the movie, so there's no need to root for them for the rest of the film.\n\nThough it's great to see a couple in a healthy relationship, it also makes for a really uninteresting movie, especially when you don't care about any of the characters. Anastasia's little personality that she had in the first film is now stripped away as she conforms herself to Christian Grey, who (despite giving up his BDSM lifestyle to be with Anastasia) is still the same manipulative control freak that he was in the first film.\n\nAnastasia doesn't know what she wants in this movie. First, she tells him she wants to take it slow after they got back together, and then they have sex in the same scene. She's also very nostalgic about the red room. \n\nThere's a scene that bothered me where Christian Grey transfers $24,000 into Anastasia's bank account after they had sex (the same sex scene described in the last paragraph). In the next scene, they're at a coffee shop and Christian invites Anastasia to a ball, but she tells him she doesn't have the dress for it. He just gave you $24,000! Don't tell him you don't have a dress for the ball when he gave you $24,000.\n\nEvery men in Fifty Shades Darker are all creepy. For some reason, Jose is back (the guy who forced himself onto Anastasia in the previous film) and Anastasia is still friends with him. My favourite character in the move is Anastasia's sexually harassing boss named Jack (played by Eric Johnson), who gets instantly jealous when he sees Anastasia with Christian Grey, and also tried to force himself onto her. His character was ridiculously over-the-top and hilarious. I think Fifty Shades Darker is the only film where I found sexual harassment funny. I hope Eric Johnson gets more screen time in Freed as he's the only reason why I have an iota of interest in the next film. Sexual harassment is obviously no laughing matter, but it's impossible to take Fifty Shades Darker seriously as there are many pointless subplots in the film. There are flashbacks of Grey being abused as a child, his ex-girlfriend who's jealous of Anastasia's relationship to Christian, and a helicopter crash where Grey miraculously survives. \n\nFifty Shades Darker was also written by E. L. James's husband, Niall Leonard. Kelly Marcel and Sam Taylor-Johnson (writer and director of the first film) at least tried to subvert the ridiculousness of the source material. There was no doubt that creative differences led to the change in the creative team, and I knew this change would make the movie worse. Niall Leonard and director James Foley will, unfortunately, return for the third and final film.\n\nThough Fifty Shades Darker is worse than the first film, I enjoyed it more because of it. It's the best comedy of the year next to The Bye Bye Man. Even if you didn't like the first film, I would still recommend Fifty Shades Darker to those who enjoy terrible movies.",

            "content": "Throughout the years, cinema has had its high points and its low points. On average, there is a general 50% percent between the good and the bad, but Fifty Shades Darker is on a new level. Let's be clear and say that there really wasn't anything good about the first film. It was a horrible script with a bad plot that wasn't very exciting, but somehow Fifty Shades Darker makes the original bearable. I felt like I was in a trance during my viewing of this picture, wondering why I even chose to watch it. Slowly becoming fascinated with how atrociously bad nearly every single second was, I just had to finish it. If anything is worse than this film this year I will genuinely be shocked. Here is why this film should be seen by every filmmaker as a lesson on how to not make a film. \n\nA film can take its time revealing what its premise is truly about in order to savour the flavour of its twists, but when a story never reveals itself, it makes its audience feel robbed. Following the conclusion that had Anastasia Steele leaving Christian Grey at the end of the first film, you'd expect that the sequel would be about one of them trying to win the other back, but that happens within the first five minutes of the film. For the next two hours, you will find yourself watching a series of dates, sex scenes, stalkers following them, and stupid injections into the so-called story that made the film laughable to say the very least. The plot of this film is that they date, develop some sort of relationship and eventually fall in love. That's it, seriously. With no inciting incidents and reluctance to have anything bearing happen, I found myself amazed that this film was even made. \n\nMost critics hate on Johnson and Dornan for having zero chemistry with one another, but that was not an issue I had with the first film, in fact they elevated the lame premise for me. That being said, even I can see that neither one of them are giving it their all here. It felt like they were forcing kinky aspects into the film when necessary, solely for the purpose of stimulating the audience. For that reason alone I felt betrayed as an audience member. Making half a billion dollars at the box office the first time around, Fifty Shades Darker barely cracked half of that. It just goes to show that quality does trump all every now and then. \n\nI've never read these novels, but it felt like the sequences that had the character of Leila stalking Christian was forced into the story to pad out the run time, making it seem like it had a bigger purpose than what was on the surface. From this stupid element to an element that has Christian facing someone from his past, to being able to overcome certain memories, everything about the small side plots throughout this film felt laughable to me. Look, I was one of the people that defended the original train wreck of a film for not being quite as horrible as people suggested it was, but there is absolutely nothing redeemable about this sequel. \n\nIn the end, there isn't a single audience I can recommend this to. Sure, it's aimed at older women, but I can even see them chuckling throughout a lot of this film. Their chemistry, along with the overall \"plot\" of this film was a step down from what was already a lacklustre film. From the horrendous dialogue to the laughter-inducing sex sequences with blaring pop music, Fifty Shades Darker feels like a parody of this genre, unintentionally. I honestly don't know how we live in a time where three of these films are being made, but this film is so terrible that I'm actually curious to see if it can get any worse than this. If you haven't seen either of these films, especially this one, you're doing yourself a very solid favour.",

In the few parts where it seems? like it'll speed up it follows the old man formula and falls flat. More an exercise in patience than an enjoyable experience.\nSecond the story. Stew meat is held together better than this. One second you're at a party, the next your in a bedroom, then a parking garage all loosely held together.  Whole sections felt disjoined not just from previous and following scenes but from the entire movie. Certain characters and plot points are introduced and then never fleshed out. All could have been cut to make an infinitely better movie.\nThird the sex scenes. Completely un-f***ing-fappable. They have all the appeal of watching your grandparents have sex on a hot summer afternoon. Interestingly they're also that dry. For a movie so hyped on them they're pretty much an after thought. There's not enough sex, or bondage play, to make them interesting. Plus they're too short. It's almost like the director said \"The movies to short. Add a sex scene to make it a couple minutes longer!\" The nudity in said scenes makes you wonder why it was even included. Pretty much it's \"here's tits badly shot. Be happy about it.\" \nNone of that compares to the ending though. The ending that confirms you will have to sit through another of these movies. If you're like me you'll be seriously considering ending any relationships until after the final movie comes out just to avoid seeing it. When you do decide to be in another relationship lie about seeing all these abominations just to avoid seeing them. Oh and you were hoping for a little something later because of this? Nope. Your libido is deader than Grey's mother after the first 15 minutes and will be for days.",

            "content": "Anime critic Jacob Chapman was once asked whether he would ever review hentai (Japanese animated pornography, for those not in the know). He replied that he wouldn't because it was impossible to review porn objectively. Other genres, he argued, could be judged according to certain seemingly objective standards (a good comedy makes you laugh, a good horror movie make you scared and so on), whereas porn rises or falls (ha ha) purely on the preferences of the viewer. In praising or criticising any given piece of erotic content, one runs the risk of projecting one's own sexual tastes onto the material and, in doing so, putting rather more than is necessary out into the public sphere.\n\nWhen reviewing erotic thrillers or dramas, therefore, one always has to assess any film on the basis of its structural and narrative integrity regardless of our more bestial responses to its salacious moments. Compared to its predecessor, Fifty Shades Darker may provide more by way of titillation, with a conscious effort to make the sex scenes more daring and ambitious (and more public) than before. But once these sections are taken out of the equation, the film becomes a very listless and lacklustre affair - it's an erotic drama which is occasionally erotic but never dramatic.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with the first film was the lack of agency afforded to Anastasia as a character - something which, it is claimed, she has more of in the books. Without any form of serious resistance (or anything more than mild reluctance) on her part, the film resembles an anaemic version of Dracula, with the mysterious rich gentleman preying on the virginal beauty. If we take this aspect in isolation, Fifty Shades Darker does improve on its predecessor, insofar as they are more scenes of Ana putting her foot down and wanting a relationship on her terms. But in the wider context of things, the film makes so many other steps backwards that this improvement becomes barely noticeable.\n\nFifty Shades Darker (Darker hereafter) suffers from the increased role of E. L. James in its production. Whether you like her work or not, adaptations can often suffer from the author being too close to the work and stifling the screenwriter's creativity; as I mentioned in my review of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, novelists who get involved in film-making so often lack the visual invention to match their verbal acrobatics. Kelly Marcel's script for the first film was largely flat and often risible, but you occasionally got a glimmer of effort being made to shape the material for the screen rather than kowtow to the author. This film's screenplay, on the other hand, comes from James' husband Niall Leonard; it feels more carefully controlled, so that the entire exercise becomes a means of indulging James' ego rather than serving the material or - heaven forbid - entertaining the audience.\n\nThis increased sense of control is also reflected in the choice of director. Sam Taylor-Johnson didn't see eye to eye with James during the production of the first film, so it isn't any real surprise that she decided to pull out of shooting the sequels back to back. Watching the film did feel like wading knee-deep through wallpaper paste, but you did at least get the impression of the director and cast trying to go against the tide of the material and emerge with something half-decent. With James Foley behind the camera as a workmanlike safe pair of hands, the characters have stopped wading and decided to lie flat on their backs on top, as the waves slowly drag them away. The film feels slow, ponderous and devoid of any pep when either or both of its leading players are fully clothed.\n\nThe sex scenes in Darker are an illustration of the film's central problem, which the increased role of James and the kid gloves approach of Foley both hint towards. Watching the scenes in isolation, they are decently assembled in terms of the editing and music compared to those in the first film, which often came across as clinical and awkward. The substance of the sex scenes is still tame by modern standards (the Emmanuelle series or The Story of O were far racier than this), and logic regularly takes a back seat; the film doesn't just not get how S&M relationships work, it doesn't always understand how ben wa balls operate. If you watched the sex scenes on their own, they may or may not do something for you - but they are not integrated with the film as a whole, and that's a big problem.\n\nIn order for an erotic thriller or erotic drama to work, it has to have a compelling story which the sex can either interrupt (in a bad film) or be a somewhat integral part (in a good one). The career of Andrew Davies (who adapted Tipping the Velvet and Fanny Hill for the BBC) is welcome evidence of this. You don't need the most cerebral or original story in the book - Basic Instinct isn't exactly Chinatown in its complexity - but if you don't find a way to integrate the nudity into the plot you end up with a film which feels like two different stories incongruously zipped together. If you don't care about the story, you may as well be watching porn; while Darker can titillate, it cannot captivate.\n\nOnce you take the sex scenes out of Darker, it becomes a boring, overwrought and very waxy soap opera, in which much is talked about but very little actually happens. Much of the action plays out like an episode of Dallas; here, as there, we get a lot of rich people swanning around doing rich people things and bickering over the tiniest detail. The ball scene is an awkward meld of Cinderella and Eyes Wide Shut, but without the wonder of the former or the creeping sense of dread in the latter. You may have a couple of moments of being impressed by the costumes or enjoying the music, but beyond that there is little to sustain our attention.\n\nEven by the low standards of the first film, Darker is a poorly written piece of work. All the character issues that were present in the first film are magnified here; the more stuff Christian buys to impress Ana and convince her that he's changed, the more creepy and suffocating he becomes. For every moment where we are let in to some part of his subconscious and given some reason to question our initial suspicions about him, part of us is always on edge and wanting to leave. But even if the characters aren't an issue for you, the film is choppily plotted and quickly descends into travelogue footage; as in some of the weaker James Bond films, people go to exotic places for no apparent reason, stay there for hardly any time at all and then leave with no explanation.\n\nThis latter problem - exemplified by the section involving the helicopter crash - only serves to emphasise how stake-free the film feels, and how much its attempts at generating tension or emotional weight fall flat. It's easy to make cheap jokes about how the series started out as Twilight fan fiction, but the script for Darker plays out like fan fiction, insofar as it goes to ridiculous extremes to put the author's chosen couple together - the results of which are regularly an anticlimax. The arbitrary changes in location also prevent any real chemistry from building between the characters, and the attempts to bringing out a darker tone (such as in the opening scenes) feel either desperate or just too jarring to be effective.\n\nThe final aspect which prevents Darker from being even a passable erotic thriller is the performances. The on-screen relationship between Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson was always awkward, but here the awkwardness is increased by the plot's attempts at raising the stakes. Johnson's irritating breathy delivery is even more annoying here, and her attempts at sounding firm or frightened are unconvincing. Dornan, equally, is too deadpan and often seems to abruptly zone out in the middle of a scene. Where before the pair made an effort in spite of the material, here they are merely going through the motions. Mind you, they aren't the only ones who are unimpressive; Rita Ora is grating, Eloise Mumford is uninspiring, and Kim Basinger looks and performs like a waxwork animatronic. It's a million miles from her work in 9 1/2 Weeks, in terms of either raunchiness or screen presence.\n\nFifty Shades Darker is a dismal and dreary sequel which does away with most of the few qualities the first film possessed. In Foley's hands, with James looming over him in the background, the film quickly descends into a series of occasionally titillating sex scenes intercut with dull, poorly staged and entirely non-compelling character drama. It's not offensively bad enough to be terrible, but it is deeply unmemorable, leaving one feeling hollow, depressed and more than a little short-changed.",

            "content": "I think no-one can deny the fact that this was the most hotly anticipated sequel of 2017, 'Fifty Shades Darker' follows the events of Fifty Shades of Grey where...... who gives a shit. Nothing here is anything more than what you expect it to be, you have your lifeless, dull characters, stupidly horrible dialogue, poor directing all bundled together in this cluster of hilariously laughable shit. I swear this film has to secretly be a comedy or a satire, i don't think a soul in the world can watch this thing and actually take it seriously. And what is the plot you may ask????? There isn't one. It's 2 hours of subplots that start from nothing and go no-where rendering this whole movie nothing more than maybe 10 minutes of sex spaced out with various boring ass scenes written by a bored as shit housewife. It tries to actually add some moments of tension, and mystery, and drama, and intrigue, but it's just so ridiculous. \n\nFirstly, the dialogue in this movie is SO bad, it is undoubtedly some of the worst content i have ever heard. Every conversation is so stale and corny to the point where potentially 'serious' conversations are actually funny. Not even kidding, i laughed more in this movie than most comedies that came out last year. It is hysterical that not one person during production didn't turn around and say \"yeh, this line sounds stupid, we should change it\". Instead, everyone just went with it and the end result is..... something, it's definitely something. But it isn't just the dialogue, every character in this movie is so flat, dry, and overwhelmingly uninteresting. The writing of everyone, especially Christian Grey is so thin you can barely call them characters, they're all walking shells lacking personality and all the basic qualities that make up a person. Anastasia Steele i could go on and on about how the way her character is (to put it simply) infuriatingly backwards but i'll save you the reading and just say she's pathetic. \n\nAnd i've got nothing against the performances of Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, i mean, you can tell they're both basically just mailing it in and i don't blame them, at this point they should just take the paycheck, get through it, and get out. Some of the other side performances though are really bad. And just to be clear, the writing doesn't do them any favours, so keep that in mind. Kim Basinger also stars in this film and i know what you're asking; Who does she play? Well, if i knew who her character was and what her role was in the film i'd tell you, but i watched the entire movie and i still have no fucking idea. Her name is Elena, and she was annoying as shit but i have no idea how she fit in to this story whatsoever....... writing everyone, this is how you do it...... \n\nAnd the plot as i mentioned earlier, it's non-existent, there is no followthrough of any storyline from start to finish that extends beyond Anastasia and Christian's back and forth love scenes. There are so many small insignificant side plots injected throughout this film that you cannot keep up with any of them and all of them are stupid and literally insignificant. Nothing has any payoff, shit happens out of nowhere, it's a big deal for 5 minutes, and then it is either slightly resolved or just forgotten. I mean, in like the final act of the film there is a helicopter crash mystery that comes out of nowhere, literally it just happens with no context. And you think ok, this pointless side plot is going to ride the film out to its finale, but in 5 minutes it's resolved and everyone forgets about it....... it's just so frustratingly stupid. \n\nBut in the end, for everything this film did so pathetically bad it offered many hilarious moments that are the only redeemable qualities about the film. And as you may have gathered, it isn't intentional comedy. Whether it is the laughable dialogue, the hilarious scenes and character interactions (that editor meeting, OMG the elevator), the spontaneous 'Chronicles of Riddick' poster appearance, or the sex timed to the music, this movie could be plenty of fun as a late night comedy.\n\n1.2/10",

There is nothing to this film whatsoever. The performances are cheap, Dakota Johnson tries but is let down completely by her character, and dialogue that is ridiculously silly and over the top. Add to that a drab story that doesn't go anywhere and a complete lack of suspense, Darker doesn't do anything to justify the continuation of this pointless series. It feels like a poor overlong soap opera episode, that shouldn't have aired anyway. There will always be something massively demeaning about the relationship at the center of the films and it is even more humiliating watching the outcome of Steele and her destroyed feminist attempts.

The acting is horrible if you can ever become undistracted from her lipstick being way over her lip lines to try and make them look more full or that he looks like a binge drinker that never showers they stuck in a suit the whole movie.

            "content": "Since I didn't want to risk having my cucumber confiscated while viewing this at the theater, I had to wait for an Asian HD bootleg to watch this sequel to the 2015 smash success \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". The bootleg I watched had all of the sex scenes removed, so I fortunately skipped all of the pap and got straight to the smear. This worked out perfectly for two reasons. For one, it's kind of embarrassing to eat a whole cucumber by myself during an erotic thriller. Second, the sex scenes might be too tittilating. This is uncomfortable as I am a devout Mormon and refuse to commit sexual relations until I am faithfully wed to my second and third wives. Speaking of Mormons, Stephanie Meyer, the author of the \"Twilight\" saga, inspired E.L. James to adapt her erotic \"Twilight\" fan fiction (titled \"Master of the Universe\") into what we now know as the \"Fifty Shades\" trilogy. Needless to say, fans of the \"Twilight\" books and movies will thoroughly enjoy the romance and nuanced acting common to both film franchises. Not having seen the preceding film, I was hoping that I could just infer what happened before the events in this movie. I did. Christian Grey is a sexy businessman who grew up in a broken home with a crack whore mother. He escaped his humble beginnings to become an illuminati-tier billionaire who enlists young women to sign BDSM contracts so he can violently (and romantically) act out his childhood trauma on them - with a heart of gold. Anastasia Steele is a beautiful girl-next-door who wants to make a career in the publishing industry on her own terms (presumably to distribute her \"Twilight\" fan fiction). After a rough patch of enduring Christian's abuse and breaking up, she immediately gets back together with him after he buys the company she works for and forces his way back into her heart because he is sorry about the sexual and mental abuse. I assume they have lots of steamy sexual sex because there is 20 minutes of footage missing from my copy. But their love is imperiled by everyone wanting to assault Anastasia, and several of Christian's former victims are stalking them. All in all, \"Fifty Shades Darker\" is one of the best comedies I've seen this year, with hints of \"The Room\", \"Showgirls\", and, of course, \"Twilight\" keeping you on your toes, if not rolling on the floor.",

And probably *SPOILERS FOR THE MOST PREDICTABLE STORY EVER*\n\nDamn, the first scene made me think \"wow, we might get character development in this one.\". But then- nope. Than 1 minute later I was like- when is the actual shit gonna start. Cuz this song is annoying, we are 3 minutes in and I already now I'll hate the soundtrack ( I was right btw). Than we go back to the creepiness of the Gray guy. He bought six gigantic pictures of Anastasya ( sorry if I spelled it wrong, I won't bother myself with checking), which were sold without her knowledge or consent. I have no idea how photography works, but I am damn sure it's not like that. Than they renegotiate their deal, She listens to him because reasons, money and plot. And then they kiss and than you realise \"omg they did not fire the writer of the first one\". One of Whatever-his-name-was Grey's submissives comes for a 3 seconds for reasons and jealousy and stuff. Than Jordan Belfort's idiotic evil twin crashes Anelia Wood and he bosses meeting, because convenience and \ncoincidence and probably stalking, knowing that guy. and than comes the sex scene and oh my god, I should've payed for a brazzer's subscription instead of giving this movie money. Oh, yeah, and someone was actually paid to write this. I don't know if it is the source material or the script, but it is still awful. I mean, I can find better scripted sex scenes on PornHub. Also, than it dawned me that the chemistry between the main actors suck. And than he has her banking account information! Information that was discussed between the main characters off screen... I guess... because... creepiness. Than weirdness surrounding Alastatasya haircut and more ex-submissive bullshit. And more creepiness. I am trying to understand this movie, but I just can't see the appeal. It can probably get a cult following for how awful it is. Who knows. Maybe The Room has a contender. Oh, and the soundtrack is awful. So they go to a party. with her wearing a butt-plug, which I guess she feels only when she is seated, but somehow didn't feel when she was seated in the car. Because plot. Oh, and the script is awful. And then- soft-core porn. Whooray.... Than more delving into Johnny's sad story for about 2 sentences  and than creepiness in the form of obsessed ex that is jealous of Lisa. I mean... white paint? Really? And how did she get in there. Johnny said it himself. I am starting to understand this movie bit by bit. I don't even pay that much attention to be honest. The only thing stopping me from pulling out my phone at that point is that that would be a total dick move to everyone else. After which I decided to shoot myself. End of the story. Which reminds me, They go to Johnny's yacht/ boat/ whatever and they have sex in the shower and they don't even show us that. Which, in retrospect- thank god. Oh look- character development... no, wait, a two sentences of sob story, which would've been more impactfull if I actually care for those sorry excuses of characters. Than Lisa learns to drive a boat. And the sound-track sucks. And than Lisa must go to New York and tells Johnny. Of course she is an independent woman and doesn't need his appr.... oh, wait she agrees the moment he tells her no, I am jealous, you will go with me. How can you not love this movie??? Than- oh, yes, that guy was into BDSM. Never mind that the BDSM isn't researched at all ( I blame the source material) and ... OH MY GOD now he explaining how the tools work. You know, most movies give normal exposition. The annoying, but , sadly, necessary one. This one isn't even needed. The movie would be the same without it. Yay for nostalgia, we are into kink again.. tho last time she hated it... and the soundtrack sucks. OH, WAIT SHE WILL BE FIRED? Give me 1 reason to care. Her boyfriend is a millionaire. Oh, wait, no, Lisa's boss just wants to fuck her. The script is awful btw, just saying. And she chooses Johnny over... what was her boss' name again... let's call him Mark. So Mark is now royally fucked. I am sooo surprised.... (no, I am not). Like, is there 1 person that didn't see this situation coming from the 6th minute. Now she is a big figure in the company or... something. She is at Marks position! I am so happy! (Totally not sarcasm).  I can not see how anyone can see this movie and like it. There are moments like this taht, yes, can be impactfull, if I gave a single shit about the characters, which can not happen with no character development. And their chemistry is awful. Aaand softcore sex... I can find better sex clips right now. Also- weirdness in the form of Johnny's stalker. I knew it was coming the moment he didn't go with her. Can this movie be more predictable?? And the stalker ( and Lisa) voice a point I have been wondering since the first scenes of the first movie. Why her? Is this some kind of reverse- gender Adma Sandler wish fulfillment? In any case it's not much better than an Adam Sandler movie. Hell, I think Adam Sandler's movies are masterpieces compared to this one. And everything is ok in the end. Because predictability. He is mad at Lisa for reasons, which they will resolve in 1 to 2 scenes (because predictability). And the soundtrack sucks. Oh, and Lisa is sassy! And has doubts that she is the right one for Johnny. And their chemistry is awful by the way. The acting is good, everything else- NO! So they swear to love each other and than fuck. Something they (thank god) don't even show us. And he has a nightmare all of a sudden and he proposes to Lisa in the middle of the night. Hooray. They wake up and the soundtrack sucks.  I am losing my patience (and consciousness) with this movie. Until the helicopter crash- than I just facepalmed hard enough to break my nose. He is gone for exactly 3 minutes. And it does nothing to further the plot, the characters or anything. I swear, I 'd break my arms too if this meant the movie ending. I have no idea why I had hopes for this film. I just hoped that it would get better. I really should've just pirated it. So he is back after exactly 3 min. and 30 sec. I decided to count it because I had nothing better to do. So Lisa says yes to his proposal and they end the movie on a sex scene. The soundtrack is awful. And after a generic boring party some random dude appears. I have no idea what the plot of the next one will be, but I sure as hell will hate it. Or a miracle will happen. Which it won't. DO NOT go see it in theaters. I'd say don't buy it. Just borrow a Blu-Ray from somebody dumb enough to buy it if you REALLY wanna see it. Which you shouldn't.",

Who am I kidding? I love these movies with all their cheap, tacky, cheesy qualities. I'm a sucker for the books and the movies, even though they aren't wonderful. So I took myself and my best friend for a girls night out the night this movie came out and reveled in all of it's glory.\n\nI was mostly excited for this movie because I really enjoyed the second book, more-so than the first one. There was more of a story, and it was a bit more realistic given some of the qualities of the movies. We start off in this movie after Anastasia and Christian have broken up after the events in the last movie.  She is definitely not over the situation(and how hot Mr. Grey is) and is avoiding all of Christian's attempts to win her back. Finally, they meet up at Jose's art gallery, where he weirdly enough has photos of Ana up everywhere. Let's be real, Christian isn't the real creep here, Jose is. Anyway, Christian buys all of the photos and asks Ana out for dinner, to which she agrees because when Christian Grey aka Jamie Dornan asks you out to dinner, you say yes.\n\nFrom dinner we see them start up their relationship again, slowly at first, and then very quickly falling back into the couple they were. They attend masquerade balls together, go to dinner, fall in love, basically they do everything that normal couples do in years in a matter of a couple of weeks.\n\nAna starts a new job at a publishing firm and we meet Jack Hyde, her new boss. He's creepy and is supposed to be kind of an ugly, old guy, but they definitely did not stick to the script. While Eric Johnson was definitely creepy and made me uncomfortable, he wasn't hard to look at. There are tensions between Ana and Hyde from the beginning, and even more tension between Hyde and Christian. Hyde makes it seemingly impossible to work for him and even more impossible to feel comfortable. Throughout the film we also meet Mrs. Robinson who Kim Basinger so eloquently brought to life. She was who I pictured when reading the book, and she made her on screen counterpart just as devious as she was in the book. Rita Ora was an odd choice for me as Mia, but I was pleasantly surprised by the choice. I imagined Mia with a more youthful, innocent presence.\n\nLet's talk about sex, baby. No, but for real. Let's talk about the sex in this movie. I don't care what anyone says about how bad the movies are, the sex is good. At least in this one. There isn't a lot of the BDSM that made so many people so uncomfortable and outraged in the first one. I personally was the most excited for the elevator scene, and I think it did it justice. There were some laughable intimate moments, of course the movies are kind of cheesy and not the books weren't very well written to begin with. But I love that even in those moments, the actors don't break character.\n\nMy final thoughts, because I don't want to give up any spoilers as usual, are on all of the lipstick they put on Dakota Johnson. I'm halfway convinced this movie was just a really long lipstick ad and I am LIVING for it. I have went as far as I can and have written down every lipstick type and shade she has on in that movie to buy. I need them all and I'm convinced that if she can wear them while being as risque and fabulous as she is, then I can wear them sitting in my office at my desk. But that could also be the part of me that thinks Dakota Johnson is the most perfect human being in the entire world.\n\n As far as a side by side comparison to the book, there were a few semi-important scenes left out, and a few things were different, but overall it stands up next to its literary counterpart pretty well. I know most people hate these movies and love to laugh at them, or do like my sister and watch them on Crappy Movie Monday, but I can't help but love them. I will watch it again, and I will revel in its terrible glory all over again.\n\nhttps://lifeofanavidmoviegoer.wordpress.com",

The reason I've given it such a high rating (well, a high rating for the Fifty Shades franchise), is because this film gives you exactly what you think you're going to get. I've read the books, but didn't fully enjoy them. When I finally caved and watched Fifty Shades of Grey, there were very few redeeming qualities to what was supposed to be an accurate on-screen depiction. In Fifty Shades Darker, however, the cast and director seemed to have not taken themselves quite as seriously. Generally, the depiction in relation to the original book is rather faithful, and there are some genuinely amusing moments that the last fim was certainly lacking.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nIf you do not enjoy the franchise, this film is not going to change your mind. However, if you were iffy on the previous film, and expected more in relation to the books, you may enjoy this one.\n\nBig-Screen, Buy-It, Rent-It, Pass?\nRent-It.",

Nope, no discoloration.  It is fifty shades darker on the brilliance color wheel from almost every other film created.  I feel like this is a bunch of alternate plots that the author stole from other stories that she liked, but she doesn't have the wit or the creativity to make this story her own.  Undeveloped plot lines, great costumes, spectacular Jamie Dornan body shots, the sex following each dramatic even like an orgasmic apostrophe to mark each occasion. Christian went from powerful looking to scruffy looking....Anna went from shy and scruffy to coiffed and empowered.  \n\nThe beginning started out with a stronger, more demanding heroine, yet rarely were her standards met.  Not a great deal of back story on Christian developed.  The whole movie had the Mrs. Robinson story-line going but the lack of resolution early on by Christian shows that he has a weakness of character when he's without a contract dictating the terms of this level of dominance over his slave.\n\nI wanted to say this had some redeeming qualities, but I'm hard up to find any.  Even the sex was a bit stale.  \n\nI'll give kudos to the set designer and the costume designer.  I really do think the actors and actresses did the best they could with what they had.",

Or was the intended demographic really all moms as claimed by some? I mean, I was there (granted to judge) and so were a surprising amount of men who werent exactly dragged there. By this logic it shouldnt be surprising Fifty Shades Darker is beating Lego Batman and John Wick.\nBut to me it sure is shocking. \nYes, it is directed by James Foley (Glengary Glenn Ross) to prove one movie doesnt get you respect...or self respect for that matter. And the star is the granddaughter of Tippi Hedren, here to prove that talent isnt part of genetics. \nWhat else is there to say. Can we blame them for such bad writing when the book came from a BlackBerry? Can you believe we have met a couple less likable than Bella and Edward? On the plus side, at least they dont look as uncomfortable as they did in the first movie.\nBut in the end, I'm willing to bet that when PornHub makes a parody of Fifty Shades Darker, it will probably recieve more critical acclaim than the original.",

The only positive I can give this is that Dakota Johnson's looks improved markedly from the first film- clearly she had some \"work\" done or else her makeup artist did a better job.  Although Jamie Dornan never did anything for me, whatever appeal he may have had in Fifty Shades fizzled in Darker.  His persona and acting had the charisma and appeal of an ironing board.  Trying to get beyond the lack of appeal that Dornan has overall, his attempts to look or act sexy fell flat.  The overall plot was choppy, and the acting was third rate- I've seen better in high school plays.  The story line veered so much from the book that it was laughable.  My biggest regrets in seeing this movie were 1) $ wasted, 2) now whenever I re-read the books I see the faces of Johnson and Dornan instead of the originally imagined characters.  If you have not already seen this, don't waste your time.  It was a FLOP, which is very disappointing as I was a huge fan of the books.",

            "content": "Where Are \"Hearts & Flowers\"?\n\nTwo years ago, Universal Pictures agreed to display the preceding unreasoning erotic-romance adaptation thought up by British E. L. James, such recklessness led to a storm of dissimilar opinions between movie critics and audience, however, and deplorably the most transcendental for the film production company, was a rotund monetary attainment, not only in its homeland but in the whole world, in part by its relentless readers and partly by its strategic launch date.Valentine's day is the picked day for releasing Jamie Dornan' and Dakota Johnson's sadomasochistic fair tale. Numerous are irrational alterations within this sequel, nonetheless, the germination of all these changes lies in its hard directional shift, as Taylor-Wood hand her director chair (within allowable boundaries) over to the filmmaker of some episodes of well-liked TV series such as \"House of Cards\" or \"Billions\", James Foley.\n\nEven though \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" wasn't well-received by most film critics, one of the most relevant swaps with the original novel was the very light but pertinent conversion in Anna's identity, the main female role. On the pages, she's fragile, more naive and more permissive; on the other hand, her effigy on screen is romantic but self-reliant, a suffragist but submissive woman, and although her mission about women's empowerment did not work, it gives something moderately axiomatic away from denigrated trilogy of James. That is probably the main conflict of the latest installment, the austere and fussy accuracy to the reference book. This time, the intrepid woman who opposed the selfsame creator has gone, foolishly, Niall Leonard, Mitchell's husband, writes and sketches empty, futile and even squalid contingencies and characters.\n\n-\"Ana\"; -\"Christian\", the metal and heavy elevator door closes tenaciously. This was the unbreathable and astute ending of the initial film, leaving the protagonist in floods of tears, thinking every day about him and trying to start over. The motion picture in question takes place ridiculously three weeks after what has happened, and I say \"ridiculous\" by unconnected and soporific distortions between the leading roles; in just three weeks, Mr. Grey suddenly forgets his firm sexual priorities to become into the authentic submissive of the storyline, in which Anastasia Steele looks more experienced, more libidinous and superficially more greedy. Fallible resolutions go on in the hands of three idle and anodyne antagonists, who covet to fracture the happy new relationship, at the same time that Grey struggles with his intrinsic shades of yesterday and today.\n\n\"Darker\", this is evidently the wrong term. Even the film opens with an involuntary self-parody about its suggestive title, are some alba roses too dark? Such name is only one tactic more in order to insinuate improving previous flaws, however, the only thing that they get is to underline them with darker ink.\n\nLeonard and Foley are a dangerous duo for the romance genre, and this should not be taken as a compliment. On this occasion, they coat it a dismal, unsatisfactory and unfounded thriller aroma; a series of circumstances poorly posed, developed and resolved. How is it possible that after being on the brink of death, he just wants to have more sex?. Besides, new characters inclusion is simply execrable, providing irregular performances, with traces of university film and a limited runtime on screen for revealing their talents, wasted time in close-ups of the main leads looking each other in the eyes.\n\nDespite the unfathomable dissatisfaction I felt, there is another portion which we can praise. The first one, openly, is its protagonist. Although Johnson can't save all the footage, she does not allow her character from drowning in that sea of insipidness and boredom, on the other hand, gives it a particular empathy. Another satisfactory feature is the partial revelation of Christian's dismal past, even accompanied by flashbacks, hence he achieved a longer participation, showing his fascinating acting talent for those minds that still watching \"The Fall\" by BBC Two.\n\nIn technical aspects, we can see major improvements within staging with regard to the previous film, with soft but amended erotic overtures, that even if they do not reach the expected level of arousal, it delivers elaborated challenges. Likewise, fireworks, masks, sex toys, parties, restaurants, Grey's remodeled penthouse and the usual Seattle aerial shots are perceived differently due to their nocturnal and attractive tones. Like its predecessor, sound support is vital both harmonizing the sensual shots and decorating fickle moments. Although the dreamlike rhythms of Legend, Sia, Swift or composer Danny Elfman do not convince for another Academy Awards nomination, they fit with complacency within artistically precious scenes, for example, Anastasia walking under the rain.\n\n\"Darker\" destabilizes first movie spectacular expectations due to reduced chemistry of its lead actors, its poorly constructed ambitions and a series of failed elections which lose out the limited potential of James' erotic books. Grey needs to marry, forget his past and be an ordinary boyfriend, reveal his shades; Anastasia wants to be the boss of the publishing house, covets more sex, yearns for redeeming men with psychological problems, now he's who wants flowers and hearts and she wants to fuck hard. An ex-submissive lurking, a stalker boss and a grown up lady try to end the relationship; with its dull ending, \"Darker\" insinuates becoming into a thriller of killers instead of romantic frippery that it should aspire to be.",

I built up a lot of excitement for it over the course of one year, and I was worried that I had built it up too much in my mind. But, after watching 50 Shades Darker it quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. \nPLOT LINE \nI'll be honest, this movies prequel (50 Shades of Grey) seemed to have absolutely no plot line, but that was not the case with this sequel. It had a nice easy to follow plot line that left me on the edge of my theatre chair waiting to see what happens. While it had a lot of similarities to the first movie, 50 Shades Darker had a plot line that made sense, and wasn't just a bunch of random sex scenes. It was rather cute the way Ana Steele (the main female character) and Christian Grey (main male character) found their way back to each other, fall and love and get engaged. The movie also ended with me greatly excited to see the final movie of the trilogy 50 Shades Freed.\n\nSOUND TRACK\nI don't know of anything worse than a movie that has a sound track that make absolutely no sense and doesn't fit the movie at all. The sound track for the movie 50 Shades Darker, could be one of the best fit movie/music pairing I have ever heard. Each scenes song went along perfectly with what was happening. I actually just purchased the sound track on ITunes because I enjoyed it so much. My favorite song in the movie was I Don't Want to Live Forever by Taylor Swift and Zayn.\nACTING \nIn 50 Shades of Grey I thought the acting was very comical. Both lead characters in the first movie looked very rehersed and ridged, but in 50 Shades Darker the lead rolls looked very comfortable and natural. Both characters also looked like a very good fit for the roll they were playing. Both seemed to have good chemistry with one another which made watching the movie even more enjoyable. The characters that played a smaller role in the movie also seemed to do a better job on this second go around. Seeing how all the acting skills have improved this time, I cannot wait to see what is going to happen in the third film. \nTIME LENGTH\nThere are always those movies that seem to be way to painfully long, and the other that feel like you blinked and it was over. 50 Shades Darker felt like it was a great combination of both. The movie ran close to 2 hours long, and did not seem like it went on forever or like it was too short. The movies perfect length also made it very easy to stay interested in what was happening in the movie. They also did a good job getting to the point, it didn't take a long time to beat around the bush about what was happening. \n\nMODESTY \nI grew up in an incredibly modest household. I never thought I would enjoy watching a movie like 50 Shades Darker, especially after seeing the first one. The first movie seemed to have just weird random sex scenes every 10 minutes which become very awkward and unnecessary. This movie however, seemed to have mellow down on those and up its modesty. Yes, it still had a lot of intimacy, but they seemed to be a lot more taste full about it and made it seem way more meaningful then they did in the first movie.",

The acting is much better with more chemistry. The music is great and it fits the scenes like a glove. The new look of Jamie is way hotter with that scruff and Ana's one is great too.\nNow a big WARNING FOR SPOILERS :\nI fell in love with all of scenes, they were well made without missing the essential elements of the story from the book. I loved the scene with Ana, Leila and Christian.. It was wonderful and how Leila knelt and the acting was very good but I wanted it to be longer even though I know they had to put many events with a limited time.\nThe intimate scenes were very sexy and sensual with the suiting music, it was very beautiful. Now, what I didn't like was apart from the scene when  Christian goes into the submissive mode and how Ana reacted, it was missing something.. I wanted more from him and her, more reactions and emotions. Apart from this it was just perfect for me as reader of the books.\nAn advice for those who haven't watched it yet, never listen and judge before seeing it, give it a try and the decide. The movie is excellent and more than enough for the fans of  the books. Well done !!",

Was i curious to watch were all this phenomenon was heading to. Yes I was. You see, there is a madness around this story. I would never in my life sacrifice a second to read these books, but out of curiosity I want to watch the movies. The thing is there is nothing there that can support a whole movie, needless to say 3 of them. There's no real plot, no real story, no action, nothing. Yet people are driven to the cinemas to watch a BDSM \"romance\". Well, this movie was no BDSM, no romance and nor was it sexy enough. There are movies out there with a single sex scene between the protagonists and it's much more steamier than the whole of this movie. Random moments that were supposed to be dramatic never managed to deliver, there was one point were the tension they were building to was diffused in an eye-blick, every choice they took, every positive step forward, they made a leap backwards. Dakota Johnson really waisted her potential with this movie, I can see her starring in something more demanding. Dornan on the other hand is really struggling with this, the way he's delivering his lines sounds hilarious. It doesn't matter though cause at the end I entertained myself making fun of the movie, and it served its purpose in its weird way. It's making a lot of mine, so everyone is happy and we can all pretend this never happened, till the time comes when the last installment is out, and we will go and watch it again. What does this say about us, I wonder.",

I wonder if that's what their attraction to this abortion of series is? Most empowered women seem to lose the silly childhood fantasy of fixing the attractive but damaged man. Since that type doesn't look twice at the people in this fan base, I'm guessing they never got that phase out of their system in college, thus allowing it to continue into their adult lives. Please stop giving these peopl you money and encouraging this \"fantasy\" *cough* left over daddy issues! *cough* Seriously though, this is how women end up with guys who beat them. I'm mean, unless that's what they really want. I think that's my take away from this. I should start beating more of my dates. Dominating them early and turning them into my new house keepers.

One thing I do want to praise the crew for is the relative subtleness of the sex scenes. They were embarrassing and awkward to watch but at least not intolerably long.

The narrative ended with her (Dakota Johnson) walking out on her billionaire beau (Jamie Dornan). Before long, they're back together, which leads to endless intimate discussions about commitment, boundaries and other boring drivel. The dialogue is embarrassingly pedestrian (I was predicting a number of lines before they were uttered). The sex scenes lacked any eroticism (but plenty of nudity) and the S&M component was PG-rated kink. The sprinkling of suspense and disaster feel contrived and add nothing. It doesn't help that the obnoxious soundtrack pounds home the character's emotional state with often ridiculously literal lyrics. Even the scenes of opulence lack visual snap. You'd have to be a true masochist to endure this painful experience. NOTE: If you must go, stay thru the early credits to see a preview of the next one.",

I\u2019m aOkay, I know I am one of those people who go pay to watch \u201cporn\u201d in public, but for the sake of the reviews I felt like this was an important one. Who am I kidding? I love these movies with all their cheap, tacky, cheesy qualities. I\u2019m a sucker for the books and the movies, even though they aren\u2019t wonderful. So I took myself and my best friend for a girls night out the night this movie came out and reveled in all of it\u2019s glory.I was mostly excited for this movie because I really enjoyed the second book, more-so than the first one. There was more of a story, and it was a bit more realistic given some of the qualities of the movies. We start off in this movie after Anastasia and Christian have broken up after the events in the last movie.  She is definitely not over the situation(and how hot Mr. Grey is) and is avoiding all of Christian\u2019s attempts to win her back. Finally, they meet up at Jose\u2019s art gallery, where he weirdly enough has photos of Ana up everywhere. Let\u2019s be real, Christian isn\u2019t the real creep here, Jose is. Anyway, Christian buys all of the photos and asks Ana out for dinner, to which she agrees because when Christian Grey aka Jamie Dornan asks you out to dinner, you say yes.From dinner we see them start up their relationship again, slowly at first, and then very quickly falling back into the couple they were. They attend masquerade balls together, go to dinner, fall in love, basically they do everything that normal couples do in years in a matter of a couple of weeks.Ana starts a new job at a publishing firm and we meet Jack Hyde, her new boss. He\u2019s creepy and is supposed to be kind of an ugly, old guy, but they definitely did not stick to the script. While Eric Johnson was definitely creepy and made me uncomfortable, he wasn\u2019t hard to look at. There are tensions between Ana and Hyde from the beginning, and even more tension between Hyde and Christian. Hyde makes it seemingly impossible to work for him and even more impossible to feel comfortable. Throughout the film we also meet Mrs. Robinson who Kim Basinger so eloquently brought to life. She was who I pictured when reading the book, and she made her on screen counterpart just as devious as she was in the book. Rita Ora was an odd choice for me as Mia, but I was pleasantly surprised by the choice. I imagined Mia with a more youthful, innocent presence.Let\u2019s talk about sex, baby. No, but for real. Let\u2019s talk about the sex in this movie. I don\u2019t care what anyone says about how bad the movies are, the sex is good. At least in this one. There isn\u2019t a lot of the BDSM that made so many people so uncomfortable and outraged in the first one. I personally was the most excited for the elevator scene, and I think it did it justice. There were some laughable intimate moments, of course the movies are kind of cheesy and not the books weren\u2019t very well written to begin with. But I love that even in those moments, the actors don\u2019t break character.My final thoughts, because I don\u2019t want to give up any spoilers as usual, are on all of the lipstick they put on Dakota Johnson. I\u2019m halfway convinced this movie was just a really long lipstick ad and I am LIVING for it. I have went as far as I can and have written down every lipstick type and shade she has on in that movie to buy. I need them all and I\u2019m convinced that if she can wear them while being as risque and fabulous as she is, then I can wear them sitting in my office at my desk. But that could also be the part of me that thinks Dakota Johnson is the most perfect human being in the entire world. As far as a side by side comparison to the book, there were a few semi-important scenes left out, and a few things were different, but overall it stands up next to its literary counterpart pretty well. I know most people hate these movies and love to laugh at them, or do like my sister and watch them on Crappy Movie Monday, but I can\u2019t help but love them. I will watch it again, and I will revel in its terrible glory all over again.",

James, such recklessness led to a storm of dissimilar opinions between movieWhere Are \"Hearts & Flowers\"?Two years ago, Universal Pictures agreed to display the preceding unreasoning erotic-romance adaptation thought up by British E. L. James, such recklessness led to a storm of dissimilar opinions between movie critics and audience, however, and deplorably the most transcendental for the film production company, was a rotund monetary attainment, not only in its homeland but in the whole world, in part by its relentless readers and partly by its strategic launch date.Valentine's day is the picked day for releasing Jamie Dornan' and Dakota Johnson's sadomasochistic fair tale. Numerous are irrational alterations within this sequel, nonetheless, the germination of all these changes lies in its hard directional shift, as Taylor-Wood hand her director chair over to the filmmaker of some episodes of well-liked TV series, James Foley.Even though \"Fifty Shades\" wasn't well-received by most film critics, one of the most relevant swaps with the original novel was the very light but pertinent conversion in Anna's identity, the main female role. On the pages, she's fragile and more permissive; on the other hand, her effigy on screen is romantic but self-reliant, a suffragist but submissive woman, and although her mission about women's empowerment did not work, it gives something moderately axiomatic away from denigrated trilogy of James. That is probably the main conflict of the latest installment, the austere and fussy accuracy to the reference book. This time, the intrepid woman who opposed the selfsame creator has gone, foolishly, Niall Leonard, Mitchell's husband, writes and sketches empty, futile and even squalid contingencies and characters.The motion picture in question takes place ridiculously three weeks after what has happened, and I say \"ridiculous\" by unconnected and soporific distortions between the leading roles; in just three weeks, Mr. Grey suddenly forgets his firm sexual priorities to become into the authentic submissive of the storyline, in which Anastasia Steele looks more experienced, more libidinous and superficially more greedy. Fallible resolutions go on in the hands of three idle and anodyne antagonists, who covet to fracture the happy new relationship, at the same time that Grey struggles with his intrinsic shades of yesterday and today.\"Darker\", this is evidently the wrong term. Even the film opens with an involuntary self-parody about its suggestive title, are some alba roses too dark? Such name is only one tactic more in order to insinuate improving previous flaws, however, the only thing that they get is to underline them with darker ink.Leonard and Foley are a dangerous duo for the romance genre, and this should not be taken as a compliment. On this occasion, they coat it a dismal, unsatisfactory and unfounded thriller aroma; a series of circumstances poorly posed, developed and resolved. Besides, new characters inclusion is simply execrable, providing irregular performances and a limited runtime on screen for revealing their talents.Despite the unfathomable dissatisfaction I felt, there is another portion which we can praise. The first one, openly, is its protagonist. Although Johnson can't save all the footage, she does not allow her character from drowning in that sea of insipidness and boredom, on the other hand, gives it a particular empathy. Another satisfactory feature is the partial revelation of Christian's dismal past, even accompanied by flashbacks, hence he achieved a longer participation.In technical aspects, we can see major improvements within staging with regard to the previous film, with soft but amended erotic overtures, that even if they do not reach the expected level of arousal, it delivers elaborated challenges. Likewise, fireworks, masks, sex toys, parties, restaurants, Grey's remodeled penthouse and the usual Seattle aerial shots are perceived differently due to their nocturnal and attractive tones. Like its predecessor, sound support is vital both harmonizing the sensual shots and decorating fickle moments. Although the dreamlike rhythms of Legend, Sia, Swift or composer Danny Elfman do not convince for another Academy Awards nomination, they fit with complacency within artistically precious scenes.\"Darker\" destabilizes first movie spectacular expectations due to reduced chemistry of its lead actors, its poorly constructed ambitions and a series of failed elections which lose out the limited potential of James' erotic books. Grey needs to marry, forget his past and be an ordinary boyfriend, reveal his shades; Anastasia wants to be the boss of the publishing house, yearns for redeeming men with psychological problems, now he's who wants flowers and hearts and she wants to **** hard. An ex-submissive lurking, a stalker boss and a grown up lady try to end the relationship; with its dull ending, \"Darker\" insinuates becoming into a thriller of killers instead of romantic frippery that it should aspire to be.",

Would have maybe touched base with the psychiatrist as a character in the movie so you could truly understand how much emotional effort Christian is making to change for the better . I'm not quit sure why the critics are so harsh. Maybe they just don't understand the premise of this beautiful unique love story.

Despite the great success of the box office, in my view largely based on the previous success of the books by E. L. James, the film was precisely booed by both the critics and the public who paid to see it. As I did in the critique of the first film, I emphasize here that I neither read nor intend to read the original books, so I will only speak about the film, although I know that many problems related to the story told already come from the original material.After breaking up with Gray, Anastasia decides to resume with him, but under conditions. Her personality changed a lot from one film to the next. She is no longer that shy girl who is unable to break a plate that we saw in the first film. She discovered her own femininity, is more confident and dominates the situation with confidence, almost to the point of reversing sexual roles with Gray. This, in turn, seems lost and not quite sure where to step, in search of firm ground. This was what surprised me most in the story told by the film. The rest (the intrigues and jealousy involving Anastasia's boss and Gray's ex-lover, or even Leila's enigmatic appearance) does not have half the interest that this change in their personality had for me. And the film also has terrible dialogues and one of the most lurid lapses of continuity I have ever seen in cinema: the complicated lingerie that Anastasia takes to the Gray's charity party and that, already on the spot, in yet another sex scene, has mysteriously disappeared of her body, leaving only a simple lacy underwear. I almost burst out laughing. Is there anything good here? Yes, but little. The performance of the two central actors in the plot is noticeably less boring than in the first film, but, as seen earlier, the impersonality and the lack of passion and chemistry between them dominates; Marcia Gay Harden did a good performance as Christian's mother and Kim Basinger was also good at the little he had to doIt goes without saying that this film is totally inappropriate for children and teenagers, given the heavy erotic material and the language used. The film had a good budget and, therefore, good production values, starting with good photography, good scene props, satisfactory editing work and a good soundtrack, composed by Danny Elfman.",

But this time there is no mystery, and the few new characters that are presented to us are barely given any focus.This is a new problem this film has. It wastes its focus on the wrong parts. Sure, Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) and Christian (Jamie Dornan) are the main characters, but the subject of Christian's condition is so milked that they simply have nothing to talk about and instead they repeat the same subjects and conversations over and over again. Occasionally we get a sex scene, of course, but they are all the same, yet treated with such attention that we are sucked into their void. \"Take me to the red room\" - Anastasia says at some point like its a big deal. She already was there.But back to the nude scenes. I thought of counting them, but then I remembered my lazy bottom didn't bother to count the number of cuts in 'Werckmeister Harmonies', a film I gave a 10; so, out of respect (and the fact that I didn't really care, to be honest) I didn't. The number is not important. At how boring these scenes are even two are too many. And there were more; that I know. I mean, I am a 22-year-old sexual hormone-filled teenager, and I am honestly sick of seeing Dakota Johnson nude stumbling around Christian Grey's opulent apartment/mansion/castle-whatever.But back to the nude scenes again (or rather one of them). In the scene where he finally takes her to the \"infamous\" red room, yet again we are presented with a boring, safe sex scene. I mean, he's got all that stuff lying around. Is like that episode of Looney Tunes where the rat exterminator comes in, proceeds to lay out all his tools on the floor, and then only uses a tiny trap and then leaves. That was funny and this scene was too (like many scenes), but here I don't believe the humor is intentional.There are three characters which are interesting: that is Leila (Bella Heathcote), a physically harmed girl coming to take vengeance on Anastasia; Eric Johnson giving a pretty good performance as Jack Hyde, Anastasia's boss and Kim Basinger as Elena Lincoln, the woman who first exposed Christian to sado-masochism. But we barely get any focus on them. Leila only appears in three scenes: first, a brief meet with Anastasia then she goes full Batman mode watching Christian and Anastasia sleep (I am still wondering how she got into the apartment) and her 'reveal' is a huge let-down. Same can be said for the rest of the characters.In the end, I guess the reason director James Foley decided to do this, was to artificially extend the plot and to make this a trilogy. This might be a good business move, but its a shameless one when it comes to the art. Yet there were moments, minutes literally, where 'Fifty Shades Darker' peaked my interest - like the scene in which Christian shows his dark side when Anastasia meets Leila or when she is harassed by Jack. But these are way too brief and instead we get a rich and empty showcase of opulence. This film could have been more. This really is a waste.",

This film completely did not give a f*ck, I was disappointed that the plots and other characters (Mrs. Robinson, Jack Hyde, Leila) were weak! It had potential to explore more of these arcs, but it didn't. It was dull and so rushed! Everything was rushed. Even the sex! I'm not expecting full-blown porn but cut the soundtrack songs out, more positions (not just mostly missionary all the time), and please bring in some foreplay. How can a movie about risqu\u00e9 intimacy not show good foreplay? Why does Christian always have an un-emotional face while having sex? No climax either? In the books, wasn't he always grinning (or proudly smiling) for his accomplishment in giving Ana orgasms? For getting off too? None of that...it cuts straight to the next scene. Man...and why was it so Soap-Opera-ish?I'm not going to lie, I read the trilogy once and I was like, \"whatever, this is the junk food to my brain\". It wasn't good, but whatever... it served some purpose. Did I think that it was the greatest love story? Nope. Did I think it was a great romantic story? Nope. I was honestly intrigued by the fetish that surrounds BDSM. But it turned out, that even if the sex was hot, it wasn't even portrayed properly. BDSM is a whole other level.I was walking out and a lot of the viewers said that it did poorly in capturing the book. Like sure, the sex was there, but that connectivity...intimacy... was not. It was like : fight, bang (sex). Argument, bang. Present, bang again. It was repetitive in the sense of just make-up sex all the time. Ana is annoying. She doesn't know what she wants in the film or in life. Its like she can't take Christian's dark ways and not kidding, a few seconds later she's okay with it, without any solidifying reason (unless its going down on her or sex) . I feel like FSoG (2015) attempted some direction towards a woman's viewpoint. Like Ana being \"dominant\" in the sense of negotiation and choices. In this film, I'm sorry...she comes off like a gold-digger. She comes off like the only reason she's with him is because he's rich. Its like \"I can't be with you, like this...(he gives her a gift), oh, I love you!) WTF? She tries so hard to be her own woman, but really ends up being Christian's (and not in the cute way like \"Oh, I'm his girl *googly-eyes*) I feel that FSoG (2015) did a better job in where Ana had control and it made sense. Here it's wishy-washy.Its just a mess, not sexy, everything is rushed that you don't understand the reasoning behind motives. They cut off and rushed great moments and characters that could have given the film more sense, romance and great eroticism. Yes its funny because it tries so hard to take itself serious. But that's about it.",

Like how Leila was really a slave to Christian?And how did she enter the apartment?A lot of nonsense **** happened!Things I did not like in this movie are:Somehow the sex scenes were not erotic, and I hated that!It took everything in the novel without thinking.And the Unrated version was useless!But I liked it though!",
