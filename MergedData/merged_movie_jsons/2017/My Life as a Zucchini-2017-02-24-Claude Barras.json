The film's quality, however, goes a long way towards making us realize that running time doesn't dictate how good something is. This film is short, but it packs a punch. One of its biggest strengths is that it doesn't try to fill up the running time or try to do many other turns in the storyline. It's very, very simply but as a result its themes are clearer than many other animated films' themes. It's handled with delicacy and subtlety. It's an incredibly strong film that I recommend.",

Simon bullies him but becomes a good friend. New girl Camille arrives and he falls for her. This is an European stop-motion animated film. It has an unusual intriguing look. The character designs have a beautiful ugliness. My only drawback is its shorter running time. There is something odd about this inbetween length and leaves me missing something. I do like Simon's turn especially. Initially, he is a full-on bully but he turns into one of the most compelling character in the movie. The story has some real heart. This is an Oscar nominated animation.",

The subject is a boy sent to an orphanage after his mother dies. After some initial trouble adjusting, he befriends a girl, and then starts developing good relations with the other children. But there are more challenges to arise.The stop-motion animation allows for all sorts of perceptive facial expressions, especially as we learn the backgrounds of the children. This is the sort of movie of which I would like to see more. Certainly more interesting than many of the animated features that we see.",

            "content": "\"Many people, for many reasons, feel rootless - but orphans and abandoned or abused children have particular cause.\" Christina Baker KlineStories about orphans such as Dickens' Oliver Twist have a special place--they remind us of what a gift family is. Having loving parents and siblings provides safe haven from hunger of the stomach and the heart. Claude Barras' moving stop- motion animation, My Life as a Zucchini, explores the plight of seven young orphans with emphasis on Zucchini, a name given to him by his drunken mother.As he goes off to an orphanage, he discovers more challenges than being with his mom, whose memory he keeps by carrying around one of her discarded beer cans. The usual bully (Simon) is in residence along with some meek kids and with Camille, a saucy ten year old ready to take on Simon's cynicism and Zucchini's love.As you can tell by the entrance of Camille, all is not lost at this homeless haven, much less the emerging sense of cooperation and compassion. The film gently approaches each major crisis with equanimity, relying not on easy solutions or catastrophes but on the emerging sense of cooperation and sincere love.It's difficult to determine what makes this animation so human with its characters and their eccentricities; all I know is that I felt deeply about each orphan right down to the wicked aunt. It's not sentimental, mind you, just powerfully humane and deserving its Oscar nomination for best animation.Could it be the Keane-like big eyes, so expressively alive with emotion? Possibly so. At any rate, this animation will appeal to all ages and answer some age-old questions about the depth of loneliness and the salvation adoption can bring.\"Orphanages are the only places that ever left me feeling empty and full at the same time.\" John M.

            "content": "\"My Life as a Zucchini\" was nominated for Best Animated Feature for the 2017 Academy Awards but lost to \"Zootopia\". It's a shame, as 2017 offered three very deserving films (I would also include \"Kubo\") and only one could take home the award. Perhaps my love for \"My Life as a Zucchini\" is influenced by my work as a social worker and therapist, as the story is a hopeful tale about children who have been shamefully abused by their parents...a common problem I had to deal with on the job.The story begins with a child stuck in the attic of a horrible home while his mother is downstairs getting drunk and violent. When she tries to enter the attic to beat the boy, he panics and slams down the trap door...and the mother falls to her death. Soon the child is being talked to be a very kind police officer, Raymond, and he's surprised to hear that the boy's mother just called him 'Zucchini' and that's the only name he knows. Fortunately for poor little Zucchini, the man is touched by this case and regularly visits him in the children's home where he is sent to live.As for the children's home, seven children reside in the place and they are given kindness and love. It's actually a pretty nice place, but your heart goes out to the children and the hell they've had to go through during their short lives. Most of the story is about Zucchini and how he adjusts to the place as well as his falling for a girl who arrives soon after him, Camille. And, fortunately, the picture, while VERY moving and sad, has a nice happy ending.This is a very, very special stop-motion film. While it's very artistic and well done it is something more...it's very sweet and has a depth to it you really don't expect in animation. The Swiss film is available in both the original French language version and an English dub (which is very good) on the same DVD. Perhaps other versions are also available, but on the DVD I saw these were the two language choices. Well worth seeing...but have a Kleenex or two handy just in case.",

            "content": "'My Life as a Courgette' was the last of the five 2016/7 Best Animated Feature Oscar nominees viewed by me, and that it is (to me) the weakest of the nominees and still manages to be a very good film is testament to how great the other four films ('The Red Turtle', 'Kubo', 'Moana' and the winner 'Zootropolis', so very stiff competition) were.There is not a whole lot wrong with 'My Life as a Courgette'. At just over an hour it is a little too short and it did have a story that was deserving of a longer length, and the depiction of orphanages (usually a dark and unhappy environment that people can't wait to leave) is rather rose-tinted. Otherwise, it is a beautifully done film that has much more to it than the quirky if silly title, the cute-looking characters and bright colourful visuals make out. Not classing these attributes as bad things in any way, but it is so easy hearing and seeing it advertised to get the wrong idea about 'My Life as a Courgette', thinking it will be a quirky film with children as its primary target audience, bright colours and witty humour when actually there is much to the film than that.It is a beautifully animated film certainly. It is very vibrantly bright and colourful, with parts of truly haunting atmosphere, a vividly immersive world and meticulously detailed backgrounds and overall visuals from the little things to the bigger effects. Just as good are the eye-catching character designs that are modelled smoothly and even with the oddball looks look and behave very authentically, for characters they are very unique and charmingly unusual (what other title character has blue hair and a red nose?).Furthermore, the music score is appropriately atmospheric and whimsical, while the writing has quirks and poignancy. The story could have benefited from a longer length but still charms, amuses and moves, with a surprisingly sober tone, while not being afraid to take risks and brave more difficult subjects with sensitivity and never heavy-handedness. This is including one of the boldest opening sequences in any animated film (perhaps the boldest since that for Disney's 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'). Everything is paced beautifully too.Characters are very easy to warm to and have engaging, distinct personalities. Voice acting in both the American and particularly French versions is very emotive.On the whole, beautiful film and has much more to it than one would think. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Deeply touching, funny, human and quirky stop motion animated film from France. While theoretically for kids, any film that opens with a depressed 9 year old accidentally killing his verbally abusive alcoholic mother (and treating it as sad black comedy) is not exactly aimed at 7 year olds. There's a lovely emotional complexity to this brief feature (66 minutes), where life at an orphanage full of kids from circumstances as damaging and horrible as 'Zucchini's actually has a kind of odd sweetness. Characters evolve and show new sides, and are wonderfully voiced very naturally in part by real kids. Plus the adults at the orphanage, as well as the policeman who bring's Zucchini there really try to provide love, support and fun for their charges as best they can (and when have we ever seen THAT in a film or even book? 'Orphanage' and 'cop' are usually other words for 'evil'). That humanity makes the limbo where these deeply wounded but wonderfully resilient kids live rich and real \u2013 and often very funny. I really appreciated how often I had no idea how things ( a plot twist or a relationship) would turn out. I liked the film from the start, but it just grew and grew on me as I watched it, topped off by a wonderfully odd 'outtake' after the film ends. Creative, alive and terrific.NB: I had just finished writing this review when I learned that the film is being re-voiced by some (admittedly excellent) US actors for release here. That may work out great, but all the performances in the original are so lovely and perfect, that I would suggest seeing the subtitled version if at all possible.",

This French-Swiss stop-motion animation film takes on a mature content but never fails to keep its child-like tone and to an extent, its innocence.It follows the story of Icare (but prefers to be called Zucchini), who lives with his alcoholic mother. After an accident, Zucchini has been sent to an orphanage by a policeman named Raymond. Zucchini's start at the orphanage is rough\u2014thanks to the Simon, the bully. From there on, we are immersed into Zucchini's adventures as he learns of friendship, of family and of love.This animated film ravel with its wonderful visuals that reminds us of the days when its was toys over tablets. In a way, this serves as a nostalgic treat for teenagers. Almost every scene carries a powerful meaning. But its greatest feat is looking at the lives of these children through a different lens\u2014they are all abandoned, damaged or broken. One has her mom deported, the other has his father jailed\u2014 these are all mature themes but nevertheless, real.But despite all that, Zucchini and his crew are all still children. They play, they dance, they sing. The film never stops to carry this child-like tone. The colorful aesthetics are impactful and an array of vibrancy spreads across the screen. It is a brave film that looks at life at an emotional depth. It's an eye-opening experience.",

            "review_title": "Delightful Swiss stop-motion animated movie almost ruined by being dubbed in English",
            "content": "\"My Life As a Zucchini\" (2016 release from Switzerland; 70 min.; original title \"Ma vie de Courgette\") brings the story of a 9 yr. old boy nicknamed Zucchini by his mom. As the movie opens, we see the boy playing in his attic room, as his mom drinks beer after beer while watching TV. After an unfortunate incident during which the boy accidentally causes his mom to fall off of the attic stairs, the boy is taken away to a country-side orphanage, where he has trouble fitting in with the other 5 kids. Then some time later, a new kid enters the orphanage, a girl named Camille. At this point we are maybe 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is a stop-motion animated film. I admit not being familiar with Swiss director Claude Barras, but regardless, Barras here brings a tale (based on the book \"Autobiographie d'une Courgette\") that cuts close to the heart about the need for love and understanding. The boy, missing his father (whom he has painted on his kite) AND his alcoholic mother (it's not clear what became of her, other that \"she went away), is desperate for love and companionship as he makes his new life at the orphanage. The main characters are fully developed, with lost of nuance, and while there is quite a bit of humor in the film, the overall feeling is more bittersweet than anything. This movie is rated PG-13 for a reason and I would not recommend this for any kids younger than 9 or 10. BEWARE: the US theater release which I saw brings the movie in a dubbed version, sadly. It takes away from the charm of the movie, not to mention the originality (it's like watching the Simpsons dubbed in French if you get my drift). That point is only driven home even more so since we get , after the movie's end credits, a fake take-out of the boy being auditioned for the role, which is shown in French with subtitles, and you can immediately feel the difference in the voice characters. Shame on the US distributor for \"dumbing down\" the US release. Last but certainly not least, there is a delight soundtrack to this movie, courtesy of Swiss singer-songwriter Sophie Hunger (check out the heartbreaking tune that plays over the end credits). \"My Life As a Zucchini\" got an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature at the recent Oscars. The fact that it didn't win is besides the point, this is a top-notch quality movie, period. My only other complaint, other than the US theater release being dubbed, is that I wasn't ready to bid farewell to this film after just over an hour... (The screening was rounded out by another Swiss stop-motion animated shortie, the 8 min. delightful \"The Genie In the Box of Raviolis\".) \"My Life As a Zucchini\" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (only 6 people, including myself), so I imagine this will not play more than a week in the theater. If you have a chance to catch this later on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I strongly recommend you do so, you won't regret it. \"My Life As a Zucchini\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

            "content": "Whenever I review a Stop-motion animated film, I always start with by saying it is a dying art form that needs a bigger lift from us. It gave a new life for filmmaking when there were no technology like computers hundred years ago for the creation of giant creatures to all the fantasy and magical world. I am glad that every year someone coming forward to show the world how beautiful these are.I think there's a quota for it and 2D animation for the Oscars. Otherwise, these formats would die sooner than we expected, so that recognition in the big stage. Every year at least one film from these two categories makes out. This year it was a double jackpot for Stop-motion animation. Including this, 'Kubo and the Two Strings' was the other one to shine in the world's biggest film awards ceremony. But winning the trophy is almost impossible in this 3D animated film world. Anyway, I'm happy for this, that I enjoyed watching it.It was a short film, that ran for just one hour. First, we have to understand filmmaking in this form is a most challenging one than any other. It is a manual work. I mean people get in there and frame by frame do all the work. So for this one hour film, they had done the great hard work and it paid off well by got nominated for the Oscars. It was also Switzerland's official submission for the Best Foreign Language Film, but failed to make progress in that race.The screenplay was based on the book. A simple story with a strong message. This is the tale of a boy with full of dreams and after his alcoholic mother died, he is taken to the orphanage. That is the last place he wanted to be where he meets a mean boy and soon becomes his close friend. Being young kids, they tend to play some pranks with officials, visitors and themselves. That's one of the ways to cope with for where they have ended. So the remaining is to tell us would they get a second chance in their lives.\u275dI don't know why I'm crying. Sometimes people cry because they're happy.\u275eWhen some take up a project like this, they are not offered to make mistakes in choosing a weak screenplay. Because there are thousands of films in production around the world and in those, a handful of animated films, but probably he's only one up for a Stop-motion animated feature. Which means everyone with the knowledge of his commitment will be looking forward to it. So the filmmakers have opted to adapt a novel, which is always a best option in filmmaking.The next is the characters. Making them come alive, particularly initial stage, the creation of models. Yep, they have done that job as well so well. Gooding looking ones, especially among the kids for having similarity with their vision. The frame rate was good. Very smoother for viewing. So technically it was a flawless for the normal watch. An impressive storyline, which might serve as a tearjerker for a few.There's a little romance, but from the children's perspective of having a crush. Since the girl character was introduced, the narration takes a fresh look. The following event becomes even more adventurous and fun filled till the end. The voice-over was excellent. From the dialogues to the film scenes very impressive. It marks the directional debut for a short filmmaker. An appreciable work and I hope he makes more like them with new technics than migrating to computer animations.One of the advantages is it is a short and sweet film, but those who love such films might feel it is too short. Most importantly, there're not clich\u00e9s like what we've seen films that takes place in the orphanages. The opening was shocking. If it was a real life, the boy would have ended in a different place. Still the emotional parts were less explored, yet very convincing for not leaning too much on that facet.The film is one of the best in its kind, but I agree it's not a masterpiece. Not if you have seen plenty of Stop-motion animations in your life. Yet it can't be neglected that easily and surely it is for everyone. I know there are folks who thinks this format of films are for little ones, but the truth is they are still in the pre 90s mindset. This is good, give it a try and you might love it. Anyway, for its rareness itself highly recommended, then you decided how do you liked it or not.7/10",

There is no flamboyant animation, no huge narrative arc, no gargantuan obstacles to somersault over, no chaotic chase sequences, no loud, yappy dialogue...basically nothing like what you might expect if this same story was told by an American studio.At 66 mins, it's short and to the point, quiet, contemplative and starkly sad, yet filled with uplifting moments of hope and tenderness, which it conveys without ever feeling contrived or overly- sentimental.The young French voice cast are terrific (I do hope anyone reading this review watches the French version and not the American dub). They do well to convey the vulnerability behind the broken characters. That, and I think some of the lines just sound so much better in French - the way the brattish Simon spits out the word \"potet\" was particularly amusing to me.The animation is rather basic and the character's faces are not hugely expressive, but enough emotion is conveyed through body posing, vocal performance and composition that you would need a heart of stone not to feel for the young gang of misfits.By the time the bitter-sweet end credits song kicked in, I was noticing a little moisture in the corner of my eye. Not sure the kids in the audience enjoyed it as much as I did though....which is an important point really. This film is NOT intended for young children. It deals with adult themes like death, neglect and abuse, in a very delicate way mind, but still, it's not something that's going to entertain the 'fidget spinner' generation.",

            "content": "\"Ma vie de Courgette\" or \"My Life as a Zucchini\" is a Swiss-French co-production from 2016 that resulted in a French-language movie. This is one of the most successful animated films of the years for sure and the recent Oscar nomination (even if it has no shot at winning probably) proves how much everybody ended up liking it. It is a relatively short full feature film, runs for roughly an hour only, not including credits and thus is not too far away from the short film category. The title (Veggie Tales anyone?) and the animation and the main character may have some people think that this is really only a film directed at very young audiences, but this is definitely a wrong statement. The film offers great characters and a truly interesting story. I personally think that the main reason why so many people like this one is the mix of emotion and realism. In the viewing I was in, there was not a single child seeing it, but several grown-ups. I am not saying at all that it is not suitable for teenagers, but that it is suitable for every age. Speaking about emotion, this is a factor that is there from start to finish as the film takes place at an orphanage for the entire time basically. We follow the lives of the characters, especially the one of Zucchini, and how they interact with each other. The kids are all somewhat tortured souls because of how they lost their parents and it's visible all the times through their actions and interactions.As we find out very early, there is another kid that seems like a bit of an antagonist, but the longer the film goes, the more we realize he is another friendly character that maybe just hides his vulnerability behind mannerisms that were supposed to be cool. It's interesting how he starts opening up and respecting Zucchini after he beats him in a fight. It's also interesting how the girl beats him with words on her very first day. This also shows that this cool kid is no antagonist as he still helps the girl in a crucial situation eventually. I quite liked her (Zucchini's love interest) and the scene with the other girl and the hair was as witty and touching as was the comparison between weather and emotional states of the kids. Of course there are grown-up characters too, some good one, some bad ones, but all credible and realistic. This animated film is a prime example of a movie that would also have worked with actors and live action. There are no fantasy elements in here, no talking animals or so, but it is a depiction of real life. The film was really written very well and it is without a doubt one of the most authentic films of 2016. I am definitely closer in giving it a ****/***** than a **/*****. Maybe I will if I re-watch it at some point, which is not unlikely. Until then, I am really glad it has received this much attention. Actually I think the ending is also pretty nice for a possible sequel and who knows with all the success here, it is certainly a possibility. I'd definitely watch it if it ever happens. Please do yourself a favor and check this one out if you have a chance.",

            "content": "Odd as it may sound, films with vegetables in their titles often turn me off; I heard of My Life as a Courgette (more commonly called a zucchini where I live in Canada) and saw Netflix marked it for ages 8-10, but had some time to kill and it was only 67 minutes on, so gave it a shot. Well, Netflix was a bit off on the 8-10. Adults will find a lot to admire in this little zucchini.Like this year's It by Andy Muschietti (yes, I will make the insane comparison), it is refreshing to see films are still being made where kids still talk like real kids; they're under 18 but they talk about sex (or draw a nude picture as we see here), whereas most modern Puritanical Hollywood movies will treat that as heresy. My Life as a Courgette also confronts the roughest subject matter fearlessly, and manages to pull at the heartstrings in the process. It may seem too easy to do that with a story about orphans, two getting adopted at the end, but it takes something special to make it feel unique- a great deal of maturity and thought went into crafting the emotions and getting them out in a genuine way. (Moonrise Kingdom also ended with adoption-by-cop following an orphan in love- its merits were also strong, though different). The animation goes with stop motion over the now-expected computer 3D, and also develops its own winning charm.",

In some scenes it becomes more explicit, in other less. But I discovered several expressions of it, all cunningly portrayed. Some gorgeous, some hide in the shadows before revealing themselves and others seem even darkly romantic. The most touching, that I will remember for some time to come; When Simon tells Courgette to take his chance - after all Simon just did to reunite the gang, wanting to have all is friends back together and as happy as possible. Sting sang; \"if you love somebody, set them free\" - here is what that might look like.Funny that this topic turns out so well, when the story revolves around kids. Food for though; about where pure love might come from and how adults need to cultivate it.This is a nice change among all the tit for tat stories and the Hollywood saga of the outsider rising to a hero that get rehashed time and time again. The voice acting by Nick Offerman was also deserves a special mention here.",

I have been following animated titles closely for the past years. Japan repeats its own tropes. Other Asian countries try new things such as live action puppets / cgi hybrids which have good comedic value, but tends to get old soon. American studio's often have their main focus on agenda rather than content. Russian seems to be so unknown that no one knows about Snow Queen and how Frozen (despite me loving that film) is basically a rip off of it. Other countries have mainly been dropping single titles which end up being disappointing. France is by no means ahead of USA and Japan, but they have confirmed their place as good 3rd. Their main problem being how little animation films they make, despite them having the biggest rate on creating good movies. My Life as a Courgette is once again a worthy title. The movie does an impressive job by being a serious work about life and its problems. While the movie follows young people and their daily life, it is not aimed for young audience - yet is completely suitable for children as well. The movie is rather substance heavy with dramatic concepts which not just any youngster nor even viewer could understand. The impressive part being how much depth the characters have on their personas -despite their young age- and how much realism they deliver.The style is original in the French style. Subdued and minimalist, yet every part is clearly put together with care and lot of planning. I will use the word \"fitting\" to describe the character design, just because I couldn't imagine them looking any other way. Each character is also made with a lot of care and planning. The opposite from Japanese movies where you can tell the main character from rest of the folks by just looking the hair color. In this movie, none of the characters are a filler. \"The night out shot in snowy forest\" scene gave me chills. The OST and bgm managed to surprise me as well. I would go as far and say that French animation movies have made me appreciate the French language which I have always found ugly sounding. It wouldn't be the same movie without the French voice actors. This is really a quality animation film from every aspect. It isn't the best thing ever, but surely an amazing animation title when comparing to general standard. I can not but recommend this to every who enjoys mature content and animation movies. I hope a lot of parents show this movie to their children as well because it has so much to offer.",

The first five minutes happen and I immediately said \"well...we're going there are we?\". Hit me like a tonne of bricks falling on my face. Essentially we follow a group of young children in a foster home as they create close bonds between them and learn to mature into adulthood. A coming-of-age drama at its most subtle, and it is with this subtlety that elevates this into a melancholic intimate experience. Child abuse, neglect, loneliness, sorrow and love. All these themes are explored through the perspective of children, and it is rather sad to watch. Witnessing these characters come to terms with their past was inspiring. No matter what obstacles life throws in your way, you can always move onwards and upwards. An outstandingly meaty narrative despite the tiny runtime of just 67 minutes. However it's not all doom and gloom. This feature will evoke happiness and bring a loving smile to your face by the end. Like I said, the subtle manner in which it addresses important issues like child abuse is what gives this film life. The colourful stop-motion animation (which I absolutely adored) and bountiful subplots are just ripples in what is a sensitive puddle. The balance between melodrama, family friendliness and humour was perfect, couldn't fault it. The small idiosyncrasies to each character gave them more personality, which I admired. I personally would've liked a longer runtime so we could see these characters interact more. Some more internal conflicts and backstory would've definitely enhanced the emotional investment. Though these are slight criticisms to what is a beautifully crafted animated story that more people definitely need to watch. Support these small films! Cinema needs them. It's just another reason why French cinema keeps on improving...",

The loss of one's parents but the gain of new family. The loss of innocence but gaining wisdom. Or gaining a friend (from an enemy) only to lose said friend. The story is deceptively simply but a ton of humanity is packed in the little moments. On paper this story is quite dour with nary a moment of joy. What joy there is laced with sadness. You would think this would work against the animation.But it turns out that the combination of the two discordant elements utterly work together. This feels very much how one views the world as child. And the film is all the more emotional for it. This film realizes its central character's viewpoint utterly.",

It isn't.What is unique about this film is that it seems to be genuinely from a child's perspective. I don't just mean that the protagonist is a kid. There are lots of movies which have child protagonists but they don't necessarily read as from a child's perspective.Take \"Coco\" or \"Moana\" for instance. These are films which feature a child doing incredible things, but the kids don't act like kids and they don't think like children. Their sense of logic and understanding is similar to an adults.

            "content": "It's been said more than a few times that we are in a golden age of animation. These sort of claims are hard to assess when we're in the middle of the time being talked about - we lack perspective; and animation isn't a medium I pay a huge amount of attention to for the simple reason that the most talked about animated films tend not to get released very widely (or at all) in South Africa).Streaming services are making it easier, though, and finally catching up with 2016's My Life As A Zucchini/Courgette (delete according to your location) was a joy. It's a short (65 minutes) Swiss stop-motion animation about an orphaned boy (who calls himself Courgette), sent to a home for foster children. The film (I watched an English language version - with an excellent voice cast - though I understand subtitled original language versions are available) tells the story of how building relationships with other orphans and adults, how they listen to each other's stories of trauma and learn to grow in trust.It would have been easy to go in one of two directions with this story: the one being a twee, saccharine affair that would be ill-fitting the serious subject matter; the other unbearably sad. That the film is neither is remarkable. The animation provides a sense of otherness that allows us to enter into the experience of the children with our defences down; the decision to portray them with wide, expressive eyes redolent of the human impulse to project on to children the innocence we wish we still had as adults.As a foster parent myself, I know full well the desire to fix the problems of the children in my care; and how those around me seem to think that foster children have no different problems to 'normal' children - and that somehow 'just' loving them will be enough to bring healing. This far from the truth - you can't just fix a human being, and no amount of love is going to undo trauma in the formative years of a person's life. The film knows this, and wisely portrays the other traumatised children as the best people to bear the burdens with a traumatised child. It's not that there isn't a role for parent or therapist or teacher, of course - it's simply that only a child who has been there can truly enter in to the pain of a child with these experiences.The film is full of deeply moving little details - the child who runs outside shouting 'Mummy?' every time a car pulls up; the way children in these situations can end up feeling like pieces moved around a board they can't see the whole of; very realistically, the children here are shown as repeatedly and forcefully trying to assert their own agency.There's a danger in the film's ending of the implication that once the children find a reconstituted family situation of some sort, that all will be well. To conclude that would not be in keeping with what had gone before; but the implication could have been more clearly avoided. Otherwise this is a tender, funny, beautiful film that avoids clich\u00e9d tear-jerking to tell a story that is truthful and repeated all over the world every day. As a charming and striking viewing in its own right, or as an insight in to the world of fostering children, this is well worth seeking out.",

This is thanks to the atmosphere and the unique characters. The simplicity of the world is the first thing which makes this film work. The characters are very unique and most of them aren't stereotypes, which is very hard considering that the film has little time to develop them. I expected main characters like; Raymond, Courgette, Camille and Simon to have unique characteristics but I didn't expect other kids and the teachers to be this original. With the help of its unique characters, the film is able to give many emotions and messages in a short but surprisingly not rushed film. There are scenes where you watch the kids dance or play and for me these scenes are the souls of the film. They are so simple, yet emotional and powerful. The film manages to be not a cliche orphanage film by the variety of its messages in a similar theme. I am writing this review after my 2nd watch because otherwise I would have been unfair to this film. It deserves to be rewatched, to be analyzed, to be recommended, to be known.

It was an adult stop motion animation that was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the 89th academy awards, but lost to Zootopia. It was an adaptation of Gilles Paris' 2002 novel Autobiographie d'une Courgette. On rotten tomatoes my life as a zucchini has a rating of 98%. The site's critical consensus reads, \"My Life as a Zucchini's silly title and adorable characters belie a sober story whose colorful visuals delight the senses even as it braves dark emotional depths.\"plot SPOILERS : Icare, the main character, lives with his mother who has become a irritable and sometimes violent alcoholic since her husband (Icare's father) left / dissapeared. Icare is seen flying a kite decorated with a crayon drawing of his father in a stormy sky- making believe that his absent father is a super hero. Later his mother apporaches him in a druken rage when he accidentally knocks some emty beer can down the stairs. Icare accidentally closes the stair hatch in fear on his mother and loud crash, implying his mother's death is heard. Icare is then pictured in a police station ansering the gentle questions of a police officer named Raymond. He tells officer Raymond he wants to go by his mother's nickname for him: Courgette (translates to zucchini). Raymond takes courgette to a orphanage that is neither miserable nor joyous. One of orphans, a ginger named Simon bullies Courgette. Courgette comes to learn the various situations of each of his fellow orphans and eventually reveals his own situation. A new girl named Camille arrives at the orpahnage shortly there after and Courgette is immediately infatuated with her and they grow to become close friends quickly. However Camille's spitful aunt repeated tries to for Camille to come live with her so she can collect government benifits. However, when court day to review the custody case arrives, Simon redeems himself by playing a recording of how Camille's aunt talks to her, causing her aunt to have an outburst in court and lose the case. ect. ect.You should watch My life as a zucchini not only because it one of the few highquality stop motion animations made every year and its careful visual design, but for its simple and quiet, yet well developed and excellently excuted story. It's a welcome change in pace from the flambouyant action, flat charcter trophes, meaningless slap-stick dialogue, and massive, world-changing narrative archs that make up the majority of animated films. There is plenty of comedy, but it never detracts from/contradicts the scenes mood or distracts from the ongoing story. The focused and contemplative quietness of this film and the intense attention to the nuanced emotions its characters experience build both starkly sad and tenderly uplifiting moments with out betraying reality. It is only 66 minutes long and makes full use of every second. Also the ending credits song is fire - Le Vent nous portera, covery by Sophie Hunger. The (French) voice actors, particularly Gaspard Schlatter and Sixtine Murat who play the two main leads Courgette and Camille did an excellent job of bring to life a child's perspective. I haven't watched the English dubbed version, but I've heard it doesn't measure up to the orginal voice acting in French, so I'd reccomend watching the French version if you can.One review called \"My Life as a Zucchini\" undercooked? Its main complaint was that the \"emotional heft of the film is unexpected and the problems some of characters face are nothing that a child should have to deal with\" and they \"don't know who'd I recommend this film to\". While their observation that the cast of characters face disproportionately heavy problems despite their young age is true, it doesn't detract from the overall movie because the film's target audience was not necissarily elementary age children even though its main characters are. In fact, I don't think this movie is well suited to a very young audience (I think some parts are proabably too mature for kids under 12/13-ish). I think the main aim of the movie was not to provide high-energy entertainment aimed at children, but to explore the emotional complexities the characters face as result of their situation. These themes are presented in layered and often nuanced ways that only an adult/adolescent would be likely to pick up on or find interesting. Another criticism of My Life as a Zucchini is that its story, which starts as a tragic orphanage situation is too cliche. While this criticism is fair in that the story does have a cliche set up, the way in which the characters navigate and cope with their situation and their emotional complexities is thoroughly explored, well executed, and ultimately very heartfelt.",

Basically Icare, who prefers to be called \"Courgette\" (or \"Zucchini\" in America) (Erick Abbate), lives with his mother (Susanne Blakeslee), who has become a violent alcoholic, due to Icare's father abandoning the family. In a drunken rage, his mother comes after him, as she comes up to the attic, he slams the door on her head, accidentally causing her to fall down the stairs to her death. Courgette is taken in by Police Officer Raymond (Nick Offerman), he keeps one of his mother's cans and a kite he made with a drawing of his father as a superhero as mementos. Raymond brings Courgette to an orphanage, there he is initially picked on by Simon (Romy Beckman), one of the kids, who tries to force him to say what happened to his parents. One day Courgette and Simon fight over the kite, after which Simon warms to him, he explains that he knows about the backgrounds of all the children in the orphanage. Simon tells the backstories of all the other kids, whose parents are either deceased or, in his own case, in trouble with the law, Courgette then tells him what happened to his own mother. One day, new girl Camille (Ness Krell) arrives at the orphanage, on first fight of her Courgette develops a crush. Simon and Courgette sneak into the office to see Camille's files, they find out that she witnessed her father murder her mother for cheating on him, and then killed himself. Camille does have a living relaive, her Aunt Ida (Amy Sedaris), but she is a spiteful woman who only wants custody of Camille for the money she will get. Whilst on a class outing to a snow resort, Courgette and Camille start to bond, he refashions his mother's beer can into a toy boat for her. Courgette grows close to Officer Raymond as he regularly sends letters and drawings to him. Raymond plans to spend a holiday with Courgette, on the same weekend that Camille is supposed to spend with her aunt, but Camille instead stows away in Raymond's car. Raymond reluctantly agrees to bring both kids to the outing, the three of them enjoy themselves at an amusement park. They return to Raymond's house, where Raymond reveals that he has a son that never talks to him. Aunt Ida suddenly appears and angrily takes Camille away. A few weeks later there is a custody meeting for a judge to determine if Aunt Ida will take Camille in. There, Camille plays an MP3 recording of her aunt's voice, where she insulted her mother and yelled at her, Aunt Ida loses her temper right in front of the judge, destroying her bid for custody. Raymond finally decides to take both Courgette and Camille in as foster children. Simon is initially angry, but he ultimately accepts that a reluctant Courgette should go with Raymond. Before leaving with Courgette and Camille, Raymond takes some group photos of the kids outside of the orphanage. While living with Raymond, Courgette continues to write letters to the kids at the orphanage, maintain that he, Camille and Raymond still love them all. Courgette now keeps a group photo of the kids on his kite. Also starring Will Forte as Mr. Paul, Ellen Page as Rosy, Susanne Blakeslee as Ms. Paterson. At first glance, you'd assume this is a brightly coloured children's film, in reality it is something of a sad one, it has a heartfelt approach dealing with difficult subjects, such as loss and abuse. The character designs are bold and unusual (Courgette being blue-haired with a red nose), and the characters themselves are well-thought out, especially the children who are impressively authentic, talking like real kids would about certain subjects, it is an odd length, being just over an hour, but it doesn't need to be any longer, an interesting alternative stop-motion animated drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated.

These latter day orphanages seem to be pretty dreary and depressing, because French History appears to be the ONLY subject of instruction, and everyone knows that's pretty much a montage of FOLLOWING THE PHILLIES AND CUBS: THE BAD YEARS. Young boys are forced to pick up their sex education from the gutters, along with--no doubt--the used condoms which they turn into \"water balloons\" in order to bombard law enforcement. MY LIFE makes America's MOONLIGHT environment seem like a Childhood Paradise when compared.",

From the poster you can see that the film is in claymation; at first, creepy, but becomes rather cute and beautiful when in motion. For a kid's film, it has quite a dark opening that would freak kids out even if they don't understand what's going on. I wasn't sure where it would go from there. The film turned out to be quite heartwarming and funny, cute and rather gentle. A great message on the relationship between parents and children and it's importance, that kids and adults can both get something out of. Sitting among kids and adults in the cinema, I had a great time.",

            "content": "When I was very young growing up in the UK, there was a children's show I watched called \"The Raggy Dolls\". Defective toys thrown into 'the reject's bin' of a toy factory came to life and had adventures. By depicting cast-outs and the marginalised finding solidarity and friendship the show aimed to represent and build empathy for children who, for whatever reason, didn't fit in.While watching the Oscar-nominated Swiss animation \"My Life as a Courgette\" I thought about \"The Raggy Dolls\" more than once and felt that the creators must have had similar aims here. The film tells the story of Courgette, a young boy who has been raised by an alcoholic single mum and now finds himself in an orphanage. The other children have faced an array of similar abuses and must find courage and hope from one another. A key strength of the film is the fine line it walks between depicting real darkness and maintaining a light enough tone for child viewers. There are hints that one of the children in the orphanage has been the victim of sexual abuse and writer Celine Sciamma deserves a lot of credit for portraying such a theme with the sensitivity it merits while maintaining a child-friendly rating.The film is an adaptation of a book by French author Gilles Paris which was largely intended for teenagers but here the focus seems to have been attracting an adult audience while leaving the experience suitable for the whole family. It certainly feels like the sort of film that parents will watch together with their children rather than leaving them in front of it. The design of the film is remarkable. The materials used, with clay for the character models but real cloth for their clothes, give the film a wonderful physicality and texture. Coupled with the small scale locations and cute designs such as the tiny wheels on all of the cars, the film has a toy-like feel which produces a protective, safe atmosphere to counter its dark subject matter.The characters are charmingly realised, with the children given the principle roles. Their actions are often heart-breaking. One girl, whose mother has been deported, runs to the door expectantly every time a car pulls up. The children all gaze longingly at a mother comforting her son after he has fallen from a sled. It definitely works - the film is emotionally affecting but genuinely hopeful.The film should be applauded for not tacking on a lengthy, unnecessary third act which ups the stakes and adds a conflict to be resolved - the orphanage is going to be bought by evil Mr. Grimshanks? We have to stop him children! Lots of movies would have done this to make the film more 'cinematic' but these are always the parts of the movie where the plot stops serving the characters and would have been sinfully out of place here. Having said that, the film does fall short of providing a Dardenne-esque breakthrough moment to bring our characters to a new state or realisation and the movie to even greater heights.This is the 3rd of the Oscar nominations for Best Animated Film in 2017 that I have seen, with \"The Red Turtle\" and \"Moana\" yet to be viewed. So far I think that the Academy definitely picked the worst of the bunch with \"Zootropolis\". At the time of writing \"My Life as a Courgette\" has 50x fewer ratings than Pixar's film on IMDb. This is a shame, as the Swiss film is a considerably more measured story and innovative film and deserves a wider audience.",

The style may be disturbing and disgusting to some, but I think it will grow on most. Basically, this story revolves around an orphan boy named Courgette and the relationship he develops. Despite what you may think, this movie is not for children. I'm not saying that it's too mature or adult, but I'm saying that this movie will most likely be appreciated only by adults or oddly pretentious children. This movie makes a difference in the film industry by enforcing the idea that animation is not limited by children's media, yet it is not trying to be overly adult. In my mind, it's a great movie, and it may be to you too.",

It's a delicate subject but Barras handles it with elegance.The set pieces, character design & every little prop contribute to its sweet quality, and the graceful storytelling makes sure that the drama remains compelling at all times. Even when the plot delves into darker elements, images are bright, radiant & filled with colours. And its stop-motion animation is executed to perfection.Overall, My Life as a Zucchini is as visually arresting as it is emotionally resonant, and makes every bit of its 65 mins runtime count. Bringing its heartfelt narrative to life with genuine compassion, and furthermore uplifted by accomplished work in technical aspects, this Swiss-French comedy-drama is definitely worth viewing.",

            "content": "This review of My Life as a Courgette is spoiler free**** (4/5)BOYHOOD, INSIDE OUT, Coraline and Kubo and the Two Strings all these films have one thing in common and that is: they focus on watching life through the eyes or the mind of a child, learning the lessons of life, love, trust and emotion. All films with refined characterization, heartfelt stories and a light tone. Swiss Director Claude Barras notes down all this in his inertly sweet, charming and utterly compelling stop-motion animation My Life as a Courgette.Inspired by Gilles Paris' novel Autobiographie d'une Courgette the film focuses on the life of 9 year-old Icar (Schlatter) who prefers to call himself Courgette, a normal blue-haired boy who loves art and is a bit of a kleptomaniac. He is forced to move into a foster home with other children his age after the loss of his mother. Here he learns the true meaning of life, trust and true love, he's lonely as soon as he moves in he doesn't quite fit in with these other children. He gets bullied, laughed at and is effected by name calling his life goes in a downward spiral until he meets the love of his life with 10 year-old Camille (Murat), he immediately learns the lesson of true love. She is just like him, she lost both her parents and is forced to live with her cruel aunt, Courgette teaches her important lessons such as: friendship, trust and family. And it's wonderful.Other stop-motion animations such as Coraline and last year's Kubo and the Two Strings have this impact embedded within them, with their gorgeous animations, through heartfelt stories, and their incredible characters and My Life as a Courgette keeps this going from blueprint to screen. It's not perfect, there's a flaw - a party scene with these children enjoying the festivities which out stays its welcome, but thankfully due to Barras' direction it's not a huge flaw. Barras' tone to Courgette's life is exceptional he deftly carries his characters (that look like they were created in Aardman's workshop) with a similar story but the love that he gently adds progresses through Courgette's eyes. The refined characterization stunningly matches heartfelt drama, emotional heft and lovable memories all-in-one. At 70 minutes it whisks by really fast, but there is more drama, more emotion and more movement around the characters than any other drama twice its length - it grabs your heart from the get-go and refuses to let go even after the credits end. A stunning French stop-motion animation that's simple in its means to fly the kite of childhood, piecing together life by the chunks and wrapping it around difficult life situations, which will stay in your heart forever. VERDICT: My Life as a Courgette is a stunning French stop-motion animation, filled with joy, emotion and a lot of drama, which sweetly conveys deep thoughts and genuine sentiment.",

It is an adult stop motion animation that was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the 89th academy awards, but lost to Zootopia. It is an adaptation of Gilles Paris' 2002 novel Autobiographie d'une Courgette. On rotten tomatoes my life as a zucchini has a rating of 98%. The site's critical consensus reads, \"My Life as a Zucchini's silly title and adorable characters belie a sober story whose colorful visuals delight the senses even as it braves dark emotional depths.\"plot SPOILERS : Icare, the main character, lives with his mother who has become a irritable and sometimes violent alcoholic since her husband (Icare's father) left dissapeared. Icare is seen flying a kite decorated with a crayon drawing of his father in a stormy sky- making believe that his absent father is a super hero. Later his mother apporaches him in a druken rage when he accidentally knocks some emty beer can down the stairs. Icare accidentally closes the stair hatch in fear on his mother and loud crash, implying his mother's death is heard. Icare is then pictured in a police station ansering the gentle questions of a police officer named Raymond. He tells officer Raymond he wants to go by his mother's nickname for him: Courgette (translates to zucchini). Raymond takes courgette to a orphanage that is neither miserable nor joyous. One of orphans, a ginger named Simon bullies Courgette. Courgette comes to learn the various situations of each of his fellow orphans and eventually reveals his own situation. A new girl named Camille arrives at the orpahnage shortly there after and Courgette is immediately infatuated with her and they grow to become close friends quickly. However Camille's spitful aunt repeated tries to for Camille to come live with her so she can collect government benifits. However, when court day to review the custody case arrives, Simon redeems himself by playing a recording of how Camille's aunt talks to her, causing her aunt to have an outburst in court and lose the case. ect. ect.You should watch My life as a zucchini not only because it one of the few highquality stop motion animations made every year and its careful visual design, but for its simple and quiet, yet well developed and excellently excuted story. It's a welcome change in pace from the flambouyant action, flat charcter trophes, meaningless slap-stick dialogue, and massive, world-changing narrative archs that make up the majority of animated films. There is plenty of comedy, but it never detracts from or contradicts the scenes mood or distracts from the ongoing story. The focused and contemplative quietness of this film and the intense attention to the nuanced emotions its characters experience build both starkly sad and tenderly uplifiting moments with out betraying reality. It is only 66 minutes long and makes full use of every second. Also the ending credits song is fire - Le Vent nous portera, covery by Sophie Hunger. The (French) voice actors, particularly Gaspard Schlatter and Sixtine Murat who play the two main leads Courgette and Camille did an excellent job of bring to life a child's perspective. I haven't watched the English dubbed version, but I've heard it doesn't measure up to the orginal voice acting in French, so I'd reccomend watching the French version if you can.One review called \"My Life as a Zucchini\" undercooked? Its main complaint was that the \"emotional heft of the film is unexpected and the problems some of characters face are nothing that a child should have to deal with\" and they \"don't know who'd I recommend this (film) to\". While their observation that the cast of characters face disproportionately heavy problems despite their young age is true, it doesn't detract from the overall movie because the film's target audience was not necissarily elementary age children even though its main characters are. In fact, I don't think this movie is well suited to a very young audience (I think some parts are proabably too mature for kids under 12or13-ish). I think the main aim of the movie was not to provide high-energy entertainment aimed at children, but to explore the emotional complexities the characters face as result of their situation. These themes are presented in layered and often nuanced ways that only an adult or adolescent would be likely to pick up on or find interesting. Another criticism of My Life as a Zucchini is that its story, which starts as a tragic orphanage situation is too cliche. While this criticism is fair in that the story does have a cliche set up, the way in which the characters navigate and cope with their situation and their emotional complexities is thoroughly explored, well executed, and ultimately very heartfelt.",

Thank you for that! The characters are so real you can't help but feel their pain when they are sad and their happiness when that kicks in. I also lived at an orphanage when I was younger, and even though I was there for other reasons than these characters I couldn't help being awe-struck by the realism.

And yet, despite all that, it manages to stay optimistic (not unlike its characters) and, sometimes, wholesome even. It is not a movie I would show to the youngest of audiences, but for teenagers it can be, I imagine, quite a lesson on how to find happiness even in dire condition (in other people, in short), and it is now, after all, quite a timely problem, with all this cases of depression and such, especially among our youth. I have a feeling that this particular story may stay with some spectator for a longer while, and it is certainly a good thing.",

            "content": "It's been said more than a few times that we are in a golden age of animation. These sort of claims are hard to assess when we're in the middle of the time being talked about - we lack perspective; and animation isn't a medium I pay a huge amount of attention to for the simple reason that the most talked about animated films tend not to get released very widely (or at all) in South Africa). \n\nStreaming services are making it easier, though, and finally catching up with 2016's My Life As A Zucchini/Courgette (delete according to your location) was a joy. It's a short (65 minutes) Swiss stop-motion animation about an orphaned boy (who calls himself Courgette), sent to a home for foster children. The film (I watched an English language version - with an excellent voice cast - though I understand subtitled original language versions are available) tells the story of how building relationships with other orphans and adults, how they listen to each other's stories of trauma and learn to grow in trust.\n\nIt would have been easy to go in one of two directions with this story: the one being a twee, saccharine affair that would be ill-fitting the serious subject matter; the other unbearably sad. That the film is neither is remarkable. The animation provides a sense of otherness that allows us to enter into the experience of the children with our defences down; the decision to portray them with wide, expressive eyes redolent of the human impulse to project on to children the innocence we wish we still had as adults. \n\nAs a foster parent myself, I know full well the desire to fix the problems of the children in my care; and how those around me seem to think that foster children have no different problems to 'normal' children - and that somehow 'just' loving them will be enough to bring healing. This far from the truth - you can't just fix a human being, and no amount of love is going to undo trauma in the formative years of a person's life. The film knows this, and wisely portrays the other traumatised children as the best people to bear the burdens with a traumatised child. It's not that there isn't a role for parent or therapist or teacher, of course - it's simply that only a child who has been there can truly enter in to the pain of a child with these experiences. \n\nThe film is full of deeply moving little details - the child who runs outside shouting 'Mummy?' every time a car pulls up; the way children in these situations can end up feeling like pieces moved around a board they can't see the whole of; very realistically, the children here are shown as repeatedly and forcefully trying to assert their own agency. \n\nThere's a danger in the film's ending of the implication that once the children find a reconstituted family situation of some sort, that all will be well. To conclude that would not be in keeping with what had gone before; but the implication could have been more clearly avoided. Otherwise this is a tender, funny, beautiful film that avoids clich\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 (C)d tear-jerking to tell a story that is truthful and repeated all over the world every day. As a charming and striking viewing in its own right, or as an insight in to the world of fostering children, this is well worth seeking out.",

In fact, Zucchini straight out asks Simon, \"hey what's Camilia's deal? why is she here?\"(26:27-27:12) not too long after Simon went over everyone else's backstory(18:06-19:36.)  I do enjoy the backgrounds, they are the best I've seen in a while. For instance, at the start of the film, you get a white wall filled with Zucchini's drawings in a small cramped attic(as to set-up his love for drawing and how bad his mom treats him). Really, even if you don't want to see the movie, look up the backgrounds in it, that was my favorite part of the film. \n\nP.S the elongated arms reminded me of \"Little Nightmares\", it was not cute",

I didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t anticipate how unique it would be in its animation and characters. The movie truly had a great presentation. I really felt the tone of the movie, and I was never bored well watching it. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s a simple, animated, French film. It wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t clear what the goal of the movie was, but I definitely got something out of it.\n\tThe plot is simplistic and nothing to extravagant. I like Marvel movies. I liked the book Ready Player One. But at the end of the day, I care about presentation more than action. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s why blockbusters don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t sit right with me. But My Life as a Zucchini has an easy-to-follow plot, and it works with the tone of the movie. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s challenging, and though the plot is only average, it sets everything up so that the characters shine.\n\tThe protagonist is a 9-year-old boy named Icare, but his nickname is Zucchini. His mother is an abusive alcoholic, and one day she is about to beat him, but he accidentally knocks her down the stairs, killing her. Zucchini is sent to an orphanage, and as one might expect, Matilda shenanigans occur. Zucchini has a cop that visits him every week or two, and the orphanage owners are caring. All the kids have tragic backstories. But Zucchini feels shy. One kid, presented as a bully at first, is named Simon. He picks on Zucchini, trying to get him to open up. Eventually, Simon is revealed to be much more complex, and it seems all the kids get along.\nOne day, another kid comes, and Zucchini develops a crush on her. The girl, Camille makes everybody at the orphanage happier, even getting the archetypal emo kid to be more social. But Camille has an abusive aunt that she lives with over the weekends. The aunt wants to take full custody of her, because she pays less taxes if she is takes Camille in. One weekend Camille goes over to stay with her aunt, and Simon gives her a recording device. Her tells her to record her aunt saying something incriminating. When the judge decides whether or not Camille will stay with her aunt, Camille plays a recording that gives the judge reason not to let the aunt take custody.\nThe movie ends with the cop that visits Zucchini every week adopting Zucchini and Camille. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s very abrupt, and the plot is probably the worst thing about the movie. The main deterrent for me was how the plot goes too fast. I was never bored during the movie, but when the movie ended I was also confused. It didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t seem like much was resolved because the pacing was off. Half of the movie was just the first act, and the main conflict, the abusive aunt, only shows up 37 minutes into the movie, and is resolved 15 minutes later. The resolution takes about 7 minutes, and the movie ultimately suffers from this lack of pacing.\nHowever, the plot and pacing are the only bad things about this movie. The best thing is the characters. Simon is the most complex, and it is interesting to see the affect Camille had on the orphanage as a whole. Zucchini is a good character as well, starting as an outsider in the group of kids, but soon being absorbed into the culture of the orphanage. Simon is the character I focused most on while watching the movie. His backstory is that his parents did drugs, and were caught by the police. At first he teases Zucchini, saying he looks more like a potato than a zucchini. But he becomes Zucchini\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s friend, and Zucchini finds that the orphanage is a tight-knit group of friends. But Simon is hard to read. He tries to be supportive of his friends, and he\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s oddly mature for his age. But he often suppresses his own emotions so his friends can be happy. At the end of the movie, when the cop offers to adopt Zucchini and Camille, he is angry about it, but he eventually comes around and tells them that they should take the opportunity, and this moment shows his stance as a friend. He sort of represents the entire orphanage, being each other\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s friends, because who needs friends more than a bunch of orphans in the middle of nowhere?\nAnother interesting feature of My Life as a Zucchini was the animation. The movie is clay stop motion, which is impressive in itself. In addition, the shadows could not look more realistic. But what really stood out was the angles and shots. No scene is to close up, and there are plenty of creative angles. For instance, at 3 minutes and 29 seconds into the movie, there is a shot that really set the tone for the movie well, with Zucchini walking away from the room his sad, lonely mother was in, out of solitude, and up the stairs, rising to his aspiration. In addition to the cinematography and layout, the lighting is really something, especially considering everything is made of clay.\nThe entire film is a true beauty, and the only thing it could have benefitted from is if the plot were better paced. The movie is a great character study. I was interested in all the characters, from the caring orphanage caretakers to the fun-loving and charismatic Camille. If I were to rate it out of 10 I would give it a 6. The movie is good overall, but the plot is all over the place, which would make it hard to sit through a second time. Even so, it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s free on Netflix, and worth a watch.",

Despite a brisk runtime of just over an hour, the movie manages to take a relaxed pace to allow to explore the unique and colorful children of an orphanage as they explore the loss of their parents and find love and friendship.  The cast of characters is a strong point in the movie, as each child in the orphanage has unique quirks and vulnerabilities, from the titular Icare, who prefers the nickname courgette given to him by his alcoholic mother, to Simon, who picks on new children until he can discover their backstory, to side characters like Beatrice, who runs to the door expecting her deported mother to return at every passing car.  The art design is also a strong point, as the clay characters are made with emphasis on sunken, shaded eyes and Rudolph-red noses, reflecting the subtle sadness weighing on these characters as they look to find family and childhood wonder despite trauma and abandonment.  Add in a predictable but heart-warming plot, and you have a truly special movie that I'm glad to have stumbled upon.",

Once there the film explores the struggles of Courgette and the other children there and how he eventually finds love and friendship.\nThe whole story is told from a child's perspective and is very effective in doing so. The language and dialogue between the children is very realistic and believable and the sometimes blunt but ordinary way that some topics are discussed aren't given the usually Hollywood melodrama. The animation style of this film is also very charming. The models and settings have a cartoonish, childish feel to them as though this is how Courgette envisions the world but are able to convey a wealth of emotion and realism when dealing with a difficult topic. Although the film is quite dark at points it balances this out nicely with genuinely uplifting and sweet moments. This film absolutely flies by at only 70mins long but it certainly isn't lacking anything in its short run time. \nThe English voice acting is also excellent. Erick Abbate and Ness Krell are great as Courgette and Camille. Nick Offerman also gives a great, understated performance as Raymond, I kindly police officer who is sympathetic towards Courgette's situation. \nAll in all this is a very simplistic, enjoyable film that will pull at your heartstrings but leave you with a warm, uplifted feeling of joy.",

(There's also an English remake in which the boy's name is \"Zucchini\", which seems a lot worse.)\n\nCourgette is an imaginative kid who lives with his beer-swilling mom until such point that he's abruptly orphaned and a kindly policeman brings him to the orphanage that will be his new home. There he meets a group of similarly-damaged kids who spend the remainder of the 66 minute running time being happy and sad and mean and kind and generally acting like regular kids trying to make the best of their unfortunate situations.\n\nThis movie is heartbreaking one minute and uplifting the next. There are sad scenes like when the newly-orphaned Courgette clings to the only memento he has of his mother -- an empty beer can. And there are joyous scenes like an overnight ski trip with a dance party. The fact that the movie is voiced by actual children lends it an air of credibility and poignancy.  \n\nThough this is a movie ABOUT kids, it's definitely not a movie FOR kids. Not only are there graphic discussions in which the kids' share their misinformed notions about sex, there are also the orphans' own grim backstories. Heed my advice or brace yourself for an awkward discussion in the car ride home. \n\nIf you see this (and if you're not a little kid, you definitely should), stick around for the credits.

Under more melodramatic (or American) hands, this could be tortuously contrived or sentimental; but understatement is the key here and the film manages to touch on various rather adult subject matters in a way that is truthful, accessible and not overwhelming for the intended younger audience, while for the older companions, they will find something emotionally and visually rich. The narrative is arguably a tad simplistic and over-optimistic, but at just over an hour long, it is a succinct and life affirmingly positive film that uses nothing but clay and a lot of heart to wonderful effect.",

Yes this is, without doubt, a lot more than some fun little short, as it packs more emotion and meaning than many films double its run-time, and delivers it all in a way that feels perfectly paced and balanced at the same time. Seriously, not a scene here is rushed or dragged out, yet the humanity of the characters and story is such that you wouldn't even mind if it was, as they hook you into the whole experience extremely tightly indeed. For that, huge credit should of course be given to the brilliant direction and voice acting, but it would also be criminal to not mention the animation itself which is just as charming and beautiful as the film that it brings to life.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It is perhaps true that the tough reality is a little too delicately expressed, but then brutality isn't really the idea here.\nVRRDICT: A beautiful, heartfelt and touching film that captures more of the magic of film in 66 minutes than most others manage in 200. Just brilliant.",

The nature of the production allows the disturbing script to deal with sensitive problems that might be off-putting in a live action movie. As performed with stop motion puppets the weighty issues take on a poignant charm.  Sometimes children find themselves without a mom or a dad. The circumstances are many: some have passed on, others arrested, deported, or maybe they have just simply abandoned them.  It's a heartwarming tale that doesn't sugarcoat the toughest thing a youngster may ever have to face. Yet somehow kids manage to weather the tribulations that life throws at them.  The narrative delves into the need for a child, and anyone really, to feel loved. My Life As A Zucchini received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature Film well before it was even available in theaters. Now it has been officially released and it's still pretty hard to find. I suspect most people will have to discover this lovingly crafted gem once it's available to rent. And please do seek it out.

Yet the film remains fully endearing, with character designs that are easy-on-the-eyes as well as artistically fascinating, and the world of the film is depicted in a way that's both down-to-earth yet fantastic. Running at just 66 minutes, the film may end a little too early for some's taste, but it also doesn't have any wasted space, and it's hardly a flaw for a film to leave its viewers wanting more.

We watch as he loses his family to alcoholism and must learn to cope with this loss as he adjusts to life in an orphanage, and ultimately the later choice to enter a new forever family. As someone who has been through the adoption process, watching it from this perspective was heartbreaking and revealing. It really explores all of the stuff that I could only imagine, perhaps most powerfully the choice that Zucchini must eventually make to leave the only friends he knows behind for a new family that remains uncertain. There is a level of trust required in that moment of decision that never quite hit me until I saw it explored in this film. \n\nWell worth a viewing, and for anyone who has adopted, it should be necessary viewing.",

There are always these foreign films that get nominated in the category but never have a chance of winning because the voters go with the most popular choice, so how do they come across something like this little gem? The beautiful textures in My Life as a Zucchini aren't limited to the onscreen animation; the textures of the script are personified with the visuals. The humor, heart, and melancholia of the storytelling makes this an unusually honest movie, and even if it isn't quite for children, it's for families regardless. Icare is a nine-year-old child whose father has passed and whose mother is an alcoholic. She calls him Zucchini (or Courgette, as is the term in Europe, hence the original French title Ma vie de Courgette), and after her death, he is taken away to an orphanage where he meets several other kids with similar domestic issues. He forms relationships with them, mostly a bully named Simon and a girl that he has a crush on named Camille, being regularly visited by a police officer named Raymond with whom he shares a father-son connection. The movie is commendable in how it treats these characters, ranging from the accuracy of their na\u00efvet\u00e9 to the shadings of emotions that they deal with and often share. It has a PG-13 rating here in the United States and it's well founded, given the movie's discussions of domestic abuse and suicide in addition to the kids' hilariously stilted attempts at explaining sex and pregnancy to each other. We don't get an explanation in this movie about storks delivering babies but instead talk about how men's willies explode while the women shout affirmative words such as \"yes\" over and over. Director/co-writer Claude Barras and co-writers C\u00e9line Sciamma, Germano Zullo, and Morgan Navarro look at the world through the eyes of these children-they know how things are supposed to be, but they don't at all know the answers. The results are funny and sad in realistic ways without falling back on exploiting audience sympathy. All of these moments make for a package that is as colorful as the characters, and with the film's 66-minute runtime, it goes by quickly and the arcs feel organic. One might fear that it would feel rushed narratively, but the pacing here is very well controlled. The only issues with My Life as a Zucchini stem from the peripheral characters, who feel like placeholders most of the time. Despite all of the characters having their little quirks, some of them don't really do much and it makes the movie feel a little imbalanced in terms of depth. Regardless, this is one of the very best movies of 2017 so far and the best nominee for Best Animated Feature this past awards season, above Kubo and the Two Strings. It's a storybook of warmth and craftsmanship, being cute without ever grating on you. You'll want to hug your parents and friends. 8.8/10, terrific, A-, far above average, etc.",

I hope it gets that nomination AS WELL as Best Animated Film. Beautiful stop motion film. Can't believe this is Director Claude Barras first film! Done so well. I love stop motion animation. Cute moments. The script was amazing. Beautiful story. It was dark but still had a good balance of funny. It was also very touching. Got me teary-eyed lol. This movie broke my heart then uplifted me. Love love loved it. The music was great as well. It was only a little over an hour long so I wish it was longer lol. Loved being around this group of kids. I loved the language as well. French is so beautiful & I'm so in love with it. The movie translated is called My Life as a Zucchini. Also seen it called My Life as a Courgette. I'm not sure I will find it on Blu Ray here but I'm hoping I can get it at least digitally cause I NEED to own this. These characters will stay with me for a long time.",

It gave a new life for filmmaking when there were no technology like computers hundred years ago for the creation of giant creatures to all the fantasy and magical world. I am glad that every year someone coming forward to show the world how beautiful these are.I think there's a quota for it and 2D animation for the Oscars. Otherwise, these formats would die sooner than we expected, so that recognition in the big stage. Every year at least one film from these two categories makes out. This year it was a double jackpot for Stop-motion animation. Including this, 'Kubo and the Two Strings' was the other one to shine in the world's biggest film awards ceremony. But winning the trophy is almost impossible in this 3D animated film world. Anyway, I'm happy for this, that I enjoyed watching it.It was a short film, that ran for just one hour. First, we have to understand filmmaking in this form is a most challenging one than any other. It is a manual work. I mean people get in there and frame by frame do all the work. So for this one hour film, they had done the great hard work and it paid off well by got nominated for the Oscars. It was also Switzerland's official submission for the Best Foreign Language Film, but failed to make progress in that race.The screenplay was based on the book. A simple story with a strong message. This is the tale of a boy with full of dreams and after his alcoholic mother died, he is taken to the orphanage. That is the last place he wanted to be where he meets a mean boy and soon becomes his close friend. Being young kids, they tend to play some pranks with officials, visitors and themselves. That's one of the ways to cope with for where they have ended. So the remaining is to tell us would they get a second chance in their lives.\u275dI don't know why I'm crying. Sometimes people cry because they're happy.\u275eWhen some take up a project like this, they are not offered to make mistakes in choosing a weak screenplay. Because there are thousands of films in production around the world and in those, a handful of animated films, but probably he's only one up for a Stop-motion animated feature. Which means everyone with the knowledge of his commitment will be looking forward to it. So the filmmakers have opted to adapt a novel, which is always a best option in filmmaking.The next is the characters. Making them come alive, particularly initial stage, the creation of models. Yep, they have done that job as well so well. Gooding looking ones, especially among the kids for having similarity with their vision. The frame rate was good. Very smoother for viewing. So technically it was a flawless for the normal watch. An impressive storyline, which might serve as a tearjerker for a few.There's a little romance, but from the children's perspective of having a crush. Since the girl character was introduced, the narration takes a fresh look. The following event becomes even more adventurous and fun filled till the end. The voice-over was excellent. From the dialogues to the film scenes very impressive. It marks the directional debut for a short filmmaker. An appreciable work and I hope he makes more like them with new technics than migrating to computer animations.One of the advantages is it is a short and sweet film, but those who love such films might feel it is too short. Most importantly, there're not clich\u00e9s like what we've seen films that takes place in the orphanages. The opening was shocking. If it was a real life, the boy would have ended in a different place. Still the emotional parts were less explored, yet very convincing for not leaning too much on that facet.The film is one of the best in its kind, but I agree it's not a masterpiece. Not if you have seen plenty of Stop-motion animations in your life. Yet it can't be neglected that easily and surely it is for everyone. I know there are folks who thinks this format of films are for little ones, but the truth is they are still in the pre 90s mindset. This is good, give it a try and you might love it. Anyway, for its rareness itself highly recommended, then you decided how do you liked it or not.7/10",

Every character feels compelling and realistic and has an understandable motivation. The visual style gives this movie its own personality. I loved how it's animated and the look of everything from the characters to the sets. Don't be fooled by its colorful and lighthearted appearance, because this is not a kids movie. I can't say it's an adult film, because it isn't either, but it's refreshing, at least in film animation, to see a movie starring a bunch of kids to be more adult-oriented and mature. There isn't a single moment that feels dull or unnecessary. The pacing is great because it always moves forward to tell us something new about the characters. The innocence of the kids is well captured here. I cared about these children and that was a shocker for me because kids in movies have the reputation to be annoying, but here, they are well developed and everyone has a distinct personality. I was genuinely shocked to learn about everything that they went through and I really wanted to see them accomplish what they want.This is a fantastic movie anyone should watch. My only issue with it is that it's way too short,  but I think it doesn't really bother me because the story it tells in that short runtime, it's genuinely interesting, thought-provoking and heartwarming. Seriously watch it, specially if you are interested in animation.",
