            "content": "I love the Jeepers Creepers franchise. But Victor Salva made too many mistakes in this one that you don't do in horror movies. Victor are you reading this? 1) Brilliant to show the Creeper in broad daylight, but you show not more than 5 seconds at a shot. Otherwise it just looks like a fat guy in a mask. If you are going to have longer shots, you need to make the Creeper itself move in a non-human way. 2) You make the Creeper WAY too powerful. Based on the earlier movies, the Creeper's success is based on how smart it is (been around a thousand years), that it can hide in plain sight (like a scarecrow on a pole), super strong, able to regenerate. and people don't believe the stories. This would be enough for any monster, BUT NO, you need to put it in front of some kind of hundred caliber truck mounted machine gun and... not a scratch. Now that is just fucking silly. We had to have SOME hope the Creeper could be stopped, like they almost got him in Jeepers Creepers 2. You could have had him ripped in half by the machine gun, then the upper half crawls over to a dead body and swallows it whole - too much for the effects budget? You can't make the monster unbeatable, because then it DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER what the protagonists do, its not going to work, it had no chance of working. You just get to see them die like it was on a conveyor belt. You killed the suspense. Finally the guy that plays the Creeper is a great actor, but he needs to lose some weight for the next outing. The Creeper should resemble a scarecrow - lean, desiccated flesh, fast, lithe - something that looks like it could fly. Not a fat guy in a shapeless red shirt with his belly sticking out. Also, one of the things that is great about the previous movies is the FRUSTRATION we sometimes see in the Creeper. Probably in the past, the Creeper went unchallenged in its feeding spree, it is arrogant. But times are changing. There is technology the Creeper is not familiar with. This could provide some awesome frustrations and hurdles for the Creeper. Its harder for him to hide in the shadows now. But overall the worst for me was putting him in front of the machine gun with no effect, and the mask for the creeper looks like it cost about $20. You need to pay for some special effects for the face and the movement of the creeper, not just the wings. Oh, one more - the truck shoots out that spear, we see the spear travel something like the length of a football field to get to the guy on the motorcycle. Then when it starts dragging the guy back, we see he is not more than 50 feet away from the truck - silliness. Victor Salva, do better, I am counting on you!!! I will pay to watch the next one, please don't disappoint me! Or send me the screenplay, I will give you feedback for free!",

            "content": "What were they doing in those 14 years between 2 and 3, staring at their shoelaces? I love the first two films because they are both scary and well made, but WOW, this film is GARBAGE. TRUST ME, this is coming from a HUGE JC fan! The film takes place between the 1st and 2nd movie, which is dumb because nobody wanted to see what happened between the 1st and 2nd movie. I wanted to see what happened after the 2nd movie, but even then, it's really confusing because the plot keeps jumping back and forth between all of these dumb characters. I couldn't tell if the film was set in the present day, in 2001, or in the 70's because of the craptastic pacing. There's even a scene where you can see a 2016 Chevy truck in a film that supposedly takes place in 2001. Speaking of pacing, there is none! Nothing happens in this movie and the film ends right when it should've started! There are so many characters that the film gets lost in itself. The first film had Darry and Trish, simple and easy. The 2nd film had the athletes and a side-plot revolving around an angry father, but it was still easy to follow and well balanced. Here, we have an old lady getting visions from her dead son, then we have Sargeant Tubbs from the first movie, then we have the anti-Creeper gang, then we have some teenagers, then we have a country boy who has a crush on a girl, and said girl also gets her own storyline. All the characters are pointless and are not flushed out because the film is trying so hard to give equal focus to everyone. The CGI is SO BAD and is EVERYWHERE in the film. It's so bad that my theater was laughing louder than the actual movie! The Creeper doesn't do ANYTHING, no smelling fear, eating body parts, he just sorta walks around and grunts. There's one good scene where a group of teenage bikers finds The Creepers truck in the woods, and it's the only good scene in the entire film. That's it! Worst of all, WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE CREEPERS'S ORIGINS!!! I've been waiting nearly 2 decades and we STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM??? The film ends on a cliffhanger but I do not want a 4th movie. This feels like it should've been made for the SyFy channel and seeing this on the big screen is like seeing Lake Placid 6 on the big screen. Just don't do it!",

            "content": "Normally with a movie like this that took so long getting and presumably had trouble securing financing, you'd expect the problem to be a restrictive budget. But actually \"JC3\" would have been better-and more like the earlier films-if it were smaller scaled and less costly. There's too much action here, too many characters, all unconvincing and sometimes silly. But what's really inexplicable is that there's way too much of the Creeper, who is no longer a seldom-seen figure of mystery but one seen WAY too often, in broad daylight, moving around like a regular guy albeit in some kind of Comic Con costume. He's not scary this way. He's just some dude in a mask. Nor is the hitherto teasingly doled-out mythology at all heightened by overly graphic FX views of him in flight, or so much dwelling on the armored truck he's got that isn't just a \"death wagon,\" it's made out of indestructible stuff and has all kinds of lethal gizmos more appropriate to a \"Phantasm\" movie.Lingering on a few characters in peril, with few and frightening glimpses of the Creeper, was clearly something that worked well for the prior installments. All that gets thrown out the window here, only lessening atmosphere and suspense. Victor Salva remains a technically proficient filmmaker (at least compared to most direct-to-video-level horror directors), and there are scattered things to like, notably giving Meg Foster a major role. Having #3 bridge the narratives of #1 and #2 was at least an unexpected decision. The movie isn't good, but at least it isn't dull (something you can't say about some of those later \"Phantasms\"). Getting an interview with Creeper actor Jonathan Breck, who appears a pleasant guy, provides a nice (if sole) bonus feature. Still, this is a disappointing film that goes from generally wrong-headed to just plain ridiculous at its ill-judged climax, at which point the Creeper becomes so feeble a menace he might as well be shown dancing to \"The Monster Mash.\" It's almost as if Salva wanted to deliberately kill off his own franchise, no matter that (of course) he claims #4 is already written.",

            "content": "Jeepers Creepers 3 is less of a movie and more of a prolonged bowel movement. Production wasn't delayed, it was 14 years of cinematic constipation, but unfortunately, they finally crapped out a pitiful, useless end to the Jeepers Creepers saga. Ironically, the budget was probably less than a roll of toilet paper. Also, for the record, I am a die-hard fan of the first two films and I promise you I went into part 3 determined to like it, despite the garbage trailers and negative online buzz that was surrounding it. Bottom-line, the first film is scary, the second is fun, and the third is cancer. The creeper did not age well. Someone behind the camera has clearly lost their touch because this one just felt like a cheap, direct-to-video cash grab made without love or legitimate purpose. Avoid this one like the creeper himself and hope it goes away for 23 years... and then another 23 after that. p.s. The ending is the biggest slap in the face to fan ever because the filmmakers know they won't be making another one... and I thank God for that.",

            "content": "This Jeepers Creepers is a far cry from the previous two and not in a good way. It's been many years since I've seen the first two but my memory is good enough to remember them not being this lousy.The story of Jeepers Creepers is that every 23 years this creature feeds for 23 days. It smells fear and uses that to determine what part of the victim to eat. It has been 23 years and it's on a mission and part of that mission is to reclaim something that belongs to him. Jeepers Creepers 3 occurred mostly during the day. Whereas that gives the viewer more to see it does detract from the scariness. They went for showcasing his vehicle more than the actual monster. Apparently his vehicle is supernatural just like he is because it was able to do a lot of impossible things. In fact, both the creature and his vehicle seemed to have picked up some supernatural abilities beyond his flying and strength.The characters in this movie all had one emotion: anger. Everyone was yelling. It was like they understood yelling to be good acting. They threw in a teenage love just for tradition I guess. It was really pathetic. The whole movie was a bunch of disconnected scenes and lines with bad CGI, bad acting, a bad plot and some killing. It was not scary, gory or intense, just sad.",

            "content": "Oh man, where do I even begin?I've been waiting for Jeepers Creepers 3 since elementary school. When the day was finally announced last month, I couldn't contain my excitement...well, I could, simply because Jeepers Creepers had worn off a bit. I had realized that the first film, though good in certain aspects, was an overall flawed film, and that the second film was an outright piece of garbage. I predicted that this film would be bad, but oh man, I never could've guessed it would be as awful as it turned out to be. JC3 makes JC2 look good. There's so much wrong with this movie that I'm not even sure where to start. First, let's start off with the plot, or lack thereof. There are several stories Jeepers Creepers 3 could've told, but it's like they didn't know which one to choose, so they just made a film with no plot at all. JC3 takes place in between 1 and 2, which is a baffling decision since that story didn't need to be told and it ruins the continuity of the JC timeline. The film revolves around, like, 9 characters and I don't even know which character would count as the \"main\" character because nobody gets adequate enough screen time. We have Officer Tubbs from the end of the first movie, a character so minor in the original that it really makes you wonder why Salva would write him a lead role. Then we have the team of Creeper Hunters led by Stan Shaw. We also have some dementia-stricken old lady, her teenage daughter, the country hunk that's crushing on her, a group of punk teenage bikers, and the Creeper himself. They all have notable screen time but most of them are totally pointless and some don't even have resolutions of concussions to their characters. Notice how out of all of these characters, I never mentioned Trisha? Despite Gina Phillips's on-poster credit, she is not in the movie at all and instead has a 15 second cameo at the very, very tail end of the movie. The film constantly flip-flops back and forth between all of these characters at the most inconvenient times, and by the time the story has come back around to a set of characters, we've already forgotten what's going on with them because the story has packed so much into a 5 minute span, yet so little at the same time.The errors in the plot continue as, well, there is no plot. Pacing is something that seems totally oblivious to Salva and company, as the film had no distinguishable act structure of any kind. The film still felt like it was in it's 1st act at the hour mark, and I'm honestly not even sure what the climax was supposed to be, if the film even had a climax to begin with! We're just watching the film and suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, the screen turns black and the credits begin to roll. Tonal shifts are aggressive in this film, as one minute it's an episode of Degrassi, then it's John Carpenter's Vampires, then it's Evil Dead 2, and then it's American Horror Story. None of it matches and it feels like 3 or 4 random scripts were cobbled together without any editing. There are some moments the feel like Salva was trying to make a borderline comedy, but it's unclear mostly due to our next point...Next is the production. Salva is a great cinematic director and the first two movies are filled with gorgeous shots and atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a blade. I suppose Salva got lazy with JC3 because this movie feels like it was made for TV. The film is laden with abysmal CGI, some of the worst I've ever seen in a theatrical release. The CGI in the original film looked better, and that came out in 2001. The editing and lighting are often so awful that you can't even tell what's happening; there is one instance where a biker is snatched, or something, by the Creeper, but it's so quick and shot so poorly you can't even tell what happens. An audience member behind me said \"what just happened?\" and I was glad I wasn't the only one. The production actually reaches \"so bad it's hilarious\" status on several occasions, including a slow-mo scene with the Creeper that was so over-the-top that it had the theater erupting in laughter. Trust me, it wasn't the only serious scene where the audience laughed hard at something meant to be serious.Even The Creeper himself is ruined. One of the most intimidating horror villains of the modern horror age has been reduced to a slightly irritated staggering drunk. Whoever decided to give him that bright red T shirt should be fired, as it looks severely out of place on him. Oh, and we STILL don't know his origins. By this point, being teased on his history comes off as a cheap gimmick, like even Salva has no idea what to do about his backstory.So there you have it. JC3 is possibly 2017's worst film so far. Too many main characters, an unfocused story with no conclusion, too much plot yet somehow not enough plot, absent pacing, a nonthreatening and goofy looking villain, Syfy channel levels of production, some of the worst CGI ever, and a massive kick in the groin towards the JC fan-base. I used to wonder why this film was denied a worldwide theatrical release, thinking Salva's history may be the culprit. I've now realized that the more likely reason is that the producers saw how awful this film was and couldn't bear to release this on the big screen. It's most definitely a home release, and that's where it should've gone. Judging by how hard my theater laughed at every scene, I doubt I'm the only one who holds these opinions.",

            "review_title": "Hahahahaahhahahahahahahahahahahaha (translation: We've found the next Birdemic)",
            "content": "Rarely do I ever witness a film in theaters that not only does nothing right, but does everything so ghastly incorrect that it becomes a comical masterpiece. Jeepers Creepers 3 is one of those films. I'm honestly very glad that I saw it on the big screen, despite paying $21 for a single ticket, but it was sure worth it. I was laughing at every second and so was the entire audience. Jeepers Creepers 3 is one of the worst horror films of the decade, but it makes for a highly amusing comedy on the same levels as Birdemic or The Room.The story and pacing are nonexistent, as the film has no plot or act structure at all. Too many main characters cause whatever story may've been there to crash and burn like the Creeper himself taking a harpoon to the chest. Many of these said characters have no resolutions and it's as if Salva forgot about half of them midway through writing the script. The dialog, if not humorously stock, is stilted and inhuman. The phrase \"alright you son-of-a-bitch\" is said more times than there are minutes of runtime. In terms of being scary, it's not. Nothing more than cheap jumpscares and every scene where the Creeper is trying to be menacing just comes off as droll.Many have mentioned the laughable production, and trust me it's definitely bad, but few have touched on how amateurish and careless Salva's directing is. \"Point-and- shoot\" camera angles, horrendous lighting so dark you can't see what's happening, actors running about aimlessly, and YouTube levels of cinematography. Actually, I'd say the entire film feels like a YouTube fan project. The actors are so obviously clueless as to what to do, just flailing about and looking confused in every scene, and it's very rare that you see actor- direction so awful in a theatrical release.I should touch up on the comedic aspects, but I sadly can't list everything without hitting that pesky IMDb 1000 word limit. I'll give it a shot, but I can't do it justice because these scenes must be witnessed to be believed. There's the scene in what might be the climax but I'm not sure due to the nonexistent pacing the film has, but a woman is being chased by the Creeper, and due to Salva's sleepwalking directing, she's just casually jogging as if she were amidst her morning workout instead of sprinting for her life. One scene involves a character being shot with his own gun, but coupled with CGI worse than a free month trial software, the clich\u00e9 and overdramatic slow-mo topped off by Stan Shaw giving a constipated look had my theater and I roaring in laughter. By far the most humorous moment involved Stan Shaw's death scene, which has the worst of everything; bad writing, bad directing, bad acting, bad production, bad CGI, and bad payoff, all of it nothing short of gut busting. I'd also like to touch up that the film is obviously setting up for a sequel, but it's obvious a 4th film will never happen. It took 15 years to make this movie and it's baffling as to why they think a 4th film could be made in a timely manner.Perhaps the most amusing thing isn't the film itself, but the nostalgic fanboys on IMDb scrambling desperately to defend this train wreck of a film. Some of these reviews make me wonder if we even saw the same movie, or if some people are genuinely blind as to what makes a movie good or bad. Some reviews even say \"yeah, the effects are awful, the story makes no sense, some moments are so dumb they're cringeworthy...but it was a great movie! 9/10!\" My personal favorite review, one that's almost as funny as this movie, is a guy proclaiming that the film was art and that if you didn't like it, you \"just didn't understand it\". I also loved that this person said the film had \"fantastic character development\", because main characters mysteriously dropping out of the film is good development? This review is almost as funny as the film itself, and I would pay a large sum of money for this person to review a foreign art-house film and see their opinion.I honestly don't think this film was denied a wide release due to Salva's backstory, after all, the first two broke box office records and honestly not many know about Salva's criminal history. Rather, I think it's because the producers realized this film belonged straight-to-DVD and is abysmal in every regard. As a horror film, this movie makes the 2nd one look good, and that's not a compliment. As a comedy, Jeepers Creepers 3 is an experience worth viewing on the big screen. If you're looking to have an amazing time, I urge you to see this when it returns on October 4th. It's honestly a 1/10, but I give an extra star because of how much fun I had.Oh and P.S.: We still don't know who the Creeper is or where he comes from. Talk about disappointment.",

I wanted more backstory, as did the rest of the people in the audience, but no explanation of the Creepers origins are even hinted at. If this franchise is going to continue it might be a good idea to give some history, and fill in a few blanks about what the creeper actually is. There were some good moments in the film that looked as though things were going to be cleared up, but in the end stayed the course and left us wanting more... anything more than watching the little hair piece stay glued to the top of Brandon Smiths' head while we try to get past the who, what, when, and why of the creeper. Not my favorite of the three to say the least. I left the theater with a lot of disappointed people. We all arrived early, and sat chatting about how excited we were to finally see part 3, and agreed that if there is a part 4 after this we would all wait for a review before buying a ticket for a one night only special event showing that wasn't worth the price of admission.

I saw this at a one-time only showing at Regal Cinema tonight (9/26/17.) This film takes place right between 1 and 2. I'll cover what I did not like, first, then go into the positive. It had far too many different characters and settings. That was way too ambitious and was just distracting. Some of the characters just fell off the radar and were not seen again. The pacing was off. Maybe because we had multiple set-ups and settings with the previously mentioned multiple characters. It was generally not scary. Literally no fear or desperation. Aside from some jump scares, a scene in back of the creeper's truck, and a very good scene with four guys on motorcycles (that scene should have opened the movie), this was not a remotely scary movie. There was no ground gained in the Creeper's origin, although it was teased.. Not enough Gina Phillips. Some truly terrible overacting by some actors and barely a heartbeat with some others. The story was not bad but the filming of the scenes felt unfinished, unrealized\u0085I kept thinking things that should happen\u0085\"those horses are going to come into play,\" \"we're going to get a great flashback,\" \"we're going to have an awesome attack on the Creeper\", etc. But nope. Not good. Ending was also very abrupt and pointless.What was good? Meg Foster was very good and the scenes with her son were good. The film was shot beautifully and Victor Salva is technically skilled. I loved the daylight scenes of the Creeper but\u0085the facial makeup effects were not awesome. Very mask like in some shots. Getting to know the Creeper's truck intimately better was great and seemed like the most realized part of the movie. The aforementioned motorcycle scene was good, the Bernardi's (ranch?) scene was pretty good, the hand subplot \u2014 all promising...but all fell short. Overall, I think I rated it a 5 out of nostalgia and being a fan. If I had not been a fan...I don't know...probably lower.",

While this tries to tie in the other movies (and the end is a nice tip of the hat one might say), there are so many flaws here, that it is difficult to really get behind the movie and the story.For some the fact that there are allegations against the director was enough to boycott the movie, which after having seen it, doesn't seem necessary. I don't think the production had any trouble or issues - while the stories and allegations exist a long time (beginning of his career), I think they came up again, when the movie was about to hit cinemas. Not sure what your view is on that or if you even care, but it is worth mentioning.Also worth mentioning, even if you don't care, is the fact that while this starts where the first movie left us off (character returning), this includes new \"gadgets\" and other stuff, that do not work well in context with what we had seen in the movies before. But maybe you don't care about that either and you just enjoy new things coming up.So while this really lets the viewer down most of the time, the beginning and the end are really almost saving the whole thing entirely!

The film MAY make a little money; however, it's not going to please the fans, and watching the film up to the end is like having sex for 90 minutes with absolutely no payoff. Instead, the viewer is left asking whether or not there will be a Part 4. My question about that is: if there was this much trouble getting Part 3 released and with continued threat of more boycotts, what would make those involved with this mess think anyone would pay for a Part 4?Unrated (I think) and damn near unwatchable.",

But, probably for a wide variety of reasons and much to the frustration of myself and many others, part three didn't immediately come. I remember that, at a certain moment, the inexistent sequel was even going to be named \"Cathedral\" and had really cool teaser poster, but alas, Victor Salva made the inferior stalker thriller \"Rosewood Lane\" and the passable backwoods demon chiller \"Dark House\" instead. Now, almost out of the blue, \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" is here after 14 years, but it doesn't have a cool extra title anymore and the plot - as well as the entire production - is formulaic and disappointing. One of the gimmicks in this franchise is that the protagonist monster only prowls once every 23 years. Perhaps Salva also should have waited 23 years to take the time and pen down a worthwhile finale to the series. The \"Creeper\", a sort of lonesome demon with a hideous mug and an unclear mythology, is busy slaughtering random teenagers and terrorizing the area with his old-timer van full of death traps. It's being pursued by the obsessive Sheriff Tashtego and a small vigilante army, but the Creeper proves that he's not the type of demon that can easily get killed. There's also a weird and confusing sub plot with Meg Foster (who actually looks scarier than the Creeper) receiving messages from her murdered son regarding the monster's origins, but that leads absolutely nowhere. \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" lacks tension, likeable characters and genuine menace coming from the Creeper character. Suspense & atmosphere were two things that parts 1 and 2 had plenty of, and therefore they still stand as modest genre classics. Considering the exaggeratedly long pre-production phase and the overall weakness of the third installment, I don't think a \"Jeepers Creepers 4\" is desirable, though.",

I don't see how he magically got time to take Darry, fly away, take his eyes out after carving his head out, stealing his truck back, all in one night? I don't get how. They made him entirely too \"human\" like. He seems to have lost his monsterness when it comes to being the creeper from the first film. Also, his new uniform is disgusting for lack of better words. He is not the same creeper who was as ruthless as in the first one, not as menacing and really just not the same overall. How was he so terrifying in the first two movies, using all his own weapons with no sign of any attachments to his truck besides the cow attachment but somehow he has upgraded?? he was enough of a monster before to where he just needed it to get around and make his way to and from his hideout. They made this movie \"funny\" and to me, that is a bad bad sign, because this movie isn't even supposed to be funny. there was more love story than it was finding out who the creeper really was or is. only hints, that weren't really hints were dropped.

Out to try and rescue her is Buddy Hooks (Chester Rushing) who isn't happy about Addison being snatched away before he can declare his love for her.An incredibly muddled script, sloppy editing, dreadful CGI, a seemingly invincible creature that drives a cartoonish vehicle loaded with booby traps and a range of fancy weaponry (including a Creeper\u0099 javelin, Creeper\u0099 shuriken, and Creeper\u0099 homing road mines), and loads of unanswered questions (despite suggesting that we might at last be given some facts about the monster's origin): JC3 is an extremely disappointing sequel in almost every way imaginable.Whatever your opinion of director Victor Salva as a person, it's hard to deny that he can turn out a fairly decent film when he really tries, but this one feels like little more than a life-less cash-in to bleed money from avid fans. If you're looking for revolting gore or decent scares, definitely look elsewhere: this one has neither (unless you count Meg Foster's frightening countenance. Old age can be a cruel mistress).",

The decision to have the monster kill people IN BROAD DAYLIGHT makes no sense from a story or a logistical standpoint and yes, he looks awful in the day.This isn't to mention that the film insists it is going to elaborate on the Creeper lore, but doesn't even pay it off. The plotlines with all these paper thin, annoying Lifetime movie characters coalesce in a nonsensical story that goes absolutely nowhere. Oh, and the truck is apparently indestructible (unlike the Creeper), sentient and has poorly rendered landmines and bulletproof wheels...it's all just so stupid. On top of ALL OF THAT, the movie tries to convince you this fits neatly in the franchise's timeline. I find that hard to believe.The Ugly: the CG is literally worse that the originals, which came out in 2001 and 2003 respectively. That blows my mind. It reminds me of Birdemic. I'm not kidding.

Let's be honest, the second Jeepers Creepers wasn't anything great either- but despite it being a forced cash grab with little to no plot- it tried to be something different and it tried to live up to the legacy of the first film. This film is not one to try. The final product is worse than fan films I have seen people make on Youtube of other horror properties, and the special effects are so blatantly horrendous and obvious that you can't help but squirt with how cringeworthy it all is. The dialogue feels like it was written by a computer and the characters are so thin you'll forget most of them even existed by the end of each scene. The acting is so triflingly bad you can hardly believe the actors were able to take themselves seriously, let alone the horrible line delivery that they have to focus on with such sincerity. To make things even better, the film just makes no sense, and looks so cheap it could have honestly been shot on an iPhone. Green screen is literally visible in shots, technology feeling more dated than Sharkboy and Lavagirl despite the 12 year gap.

I did however want to see the series continue and was looking forward to this.Sadly the road to release wasn't easy for Jeepers Creepers 3, people didn't care about the movie so much as wish to boycott it due to the director/writer Victor Salva being a convicted paedophile. This frustrated me because though I understand peoples wishes to screw over this disgusting human being they are too blinkered. Can we kindly remember that this movie provided the livelihood of hundreds of people not just Salva, bigger picture people.And the movie, isn't half bad actually. In fact I'd say it's the best one yet. Full of interesting ideas, great kills and really builds up the mythology.Sadly that's also its greatest flaw. This third part really humanizes the creeper, takes it away from being a mysterious creature cloaked in shadow. We now begin to find out it's origins, but alas the movie poses questions, gives the characters the answers but never relays them to the audience.This wouldn't be so bad if it were a AAA movie guaranteed another part but this simply isn't. Will we get answers? Will we get a 4th part? Will we wait almost 15yrs for it again? Will it even get made due to the boycotting?If they'd done a better ending complete with answers then I'd consider Jeepers Creepers 3 a really quite good film but in its current state it's enjoyable but flawed.The Good:Some great charactersWell castThe Bad:Very much feels like a made for tv movieFAR too open endedThings I Learnt From This Movie:Meg Fosters eyes still stun me",

I had some high expectations for this movie because the 1st and 2nd movie were so good and I thought this 3rd movie would have been way better. Although, when I went to the movies to see the movie I was really disappointed on how it turned out. There were many flaws from the movie. For example on how the video effects and cinematography turned out, this had way more green screen action then the 1st and 2nd movie those two movies took place in the open and I think this movie didn't get enough of the open area. Also I was a little disappointed that they didn't tell us who Jeepers creepers really was. That was one of the reasons I wanted to see the movie. I do understand why the movie looked the way it did because the video effects and it was because they were on a low budget which is also why it wasn't advertised as much. So probably why a lot of people didn't know about the movie's release date or anything. Even with a lot of the things that was wrong with the movie I just hope in some way if they make another movie it comes out to be better.",

In the first two films, he was gorgeous. And that was 20 years ago. I understand that there was a low budget for part 3. It is sad.

            "content": "Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017) O.K., I knew this would be a bad idea. The original Jeepers Creepers was a dark, creepy and effective horror movie until about the last 20 minutes. It has been awhile since I saw the original, but I remember the introduction to the Creeper was pretty terrifying. Jeepers Creepers 2 was just awful, as to be expected from a sequel of a movie like the original horror flick.This brings us to the subject at hand, Jeepers Creepers 3, a film that I recorded from the SyFy network so that I could watch what turned out to be the greatest World Series slug-fest ever, Houston defeating The Dodgers 13-12. It was a good choice watching the baseball game as when I finally got around to watching Jeepers Creepers 3 it was simply horrible.Here is the synopsis of the movie. It was not about a monster, it was about a pouting girl who cannot afford to feed her horse. She also had a crazy Grandma who sat on a tractor staring out into space. Eventually Grandma dug up a Creeper hand and all Hell broke loose, or what passes for Hell breaking loose in this stinker of a film. That's about it, thanks for reading. Just kidding.Moving forward, the horse gets his lunch and the sad girl is out with some clown at the feed store who wanted to get into her pants, so he bought feed for Flicka. They ended up out in the woods, and when danger reared its ugly head, of course, the truck would not start. I will say that Meg Foster as Grandma was the scariest thing in this movie. I don't know what they did to her, maybe they sent her to Ugly Bulimia Camp, but she really looked rough.Anyway, just meh on this movie. It was not creepy, it was not scary and it was shot nearly all in broad daylight, which totally jettisoned any chance of this lazy effort being remotely scary. Only at the very end of the movie was it dark and foggy, but the ridiculously poor acting and editing (not to mention the cheap, annoying soundtrack) made it more laughable than horrifying. What made things worse (or better, depending on your perspective) is that there was about 10 minutes of commercials on SyFy for every 5 minute of movie. Thank Goat for DVR and fast forward\u0085or not. I cannot properly articulate just how bad this movie sucked. Victor Salva may have learned how to toss salad in prison, but he sure didn't learn how to make a movie sequel.Jonathan Breck, who was a terrifying presence in the original, was totally squandered in this movie. I really don't care anymore as I am typing this review while the movie is still running. The Creeper just goes around in broad daylight, doing his thing, and avoid the police by the use of his police scanner. He was also inexplicably wearing a red shirt. I mean, why? Instead of scaring the Hell out of us flying around at night, he is running through a field (with his red shirt) wielding an axe that looks like it came from a LarpFest. The ending of the movie was absolutely pathetic. I mean what in the Hell does a random rabbit and that stupid horse have to do with Jeepers Creepers? Plus, the ending left the door open for another movie. Victor Salva should be returned to prison for this movie, much less if he ever attempted to make another one. Just, no.",

            "content": "I remember bits and pieces of the original Jeepers Creepers, and I remember the second film much better, because of what the infamous monster got up to in it, it had been a long time coming, but I eventually got to the third movie, directed by Victor Salva (Jeepers Creepers, Jeepers Creepers 2). Basically, it opens with a shuriken (throwing star) flying through the air, with a man running for his life, until the Creeper (Jonathan Breck) drops from the sky and flies off with him. Kenny Brandon (Jordan Salloum) gets out from his truck after witnessing this, and a machete falls from the sky, followed by the Creeper's hand. Twenty-three years later, police discover the Creeper's truck filled with dead bodies, but the truck is booby-trapped. Sergeant Davis Tubbs (Brandon Smith) tells Sheriff Dan Tashtego (Stan Shaw) what happened, and Tashtego tells Tubbs about the Creeper and its motives. They rush to get the Creeper's truck back after learning it is headed for the impound. As Frank (Michael Papajohn) and Deputy Dana Lang (Joyce Giraud) transport the vehicle, the Creeper lands on the tow truck and severs the cables. They watch as the truck drives off seemingly on its own, while the Creeper stands on top of it. When the truck returns, the Creeper abducts Frank while Lang stands frozen in fear. The next day, Kenny's mother Gaylen (Meg Foster) sees a vision of Kenny, who was killed by the Creeper; he warns it will come for what he buried on the property and will kill anyone still there, including her and his niece Addison (Gabrielle Haugh). Meanwhile, Tubbs joins a small team Tashtego put together from relatives of Creeper victims to kill it. Later, a group of teenagers discover the Creeper's truck in a field. One of them, Kirk Mathers (Ryan Moore), accidentally activates the spear, getting impaled in the leg and trapped. Two of the other boys try to free him, before running away from the Creeper when it returns, but it kills them both with another spear, pinning them to a tree. The last boy almost escapes the Creeper, but it discovers he peed on his truck and kills him. Later, Addison goes into town to buy hay, she meets her friend Buddy Hooks (Chester Rushing) and joins him delivering more hay to a plantation house. They find the owner and a couple of workers hiding under cars; the owner tells them to call for help. Before they can leave, the Creeper abducts Addison. Gaylen remembers clues in her vision, digs up the hand that Kenny found; and goes into a trance when she touches it. When Tashtego's team arrives, Gaylen reveals the hand can tell them about the Creeper. Tashtego touches the hand and is left shocked by how ancient the Creeper is. Addison wakes up in the Creeper's truck with Kirk; they try to find a way out, but Kirk activates a booby trap and is impaled by a metal pipe through his head. Meanwhile, Tashtego and Tubbs discover the Creeper's location and they head off, along with Michael who has a mini gun on a truck. They find the Creeper driving down the highway, but shooting at it, all bullets deflect, and Michael is killed. A small explosive is ejected from the Creeper's truck and when it goes off, Tashtego and Tubbs' car lands in a field. Tubbs gets out and tries to shoot the Creeper, with no success. However, before the Creeper can kill Tubbs, Tashtego gets its attention. Seeming to sense he knows about it, the Creeper leaps into the air after him. Tashtego shoots him many times with the mini gun, but the bullets have little effect, and he is tackled to the ground and struck in the head with an axe. With most of the team gone, Tubbs retreats. That night, the Creeper discovers that Addison is still alive, but before he can kill her, she causes the metal pipe to shoot out and impale his head. The Creeper loses an eye and Addison escapes; his aim is off when he tries to kill her. He tries one last time to hit her with an axe, but he is hit by a truck. The truck driver gets out to see what happened, he is killed, and his body used by the Creeper to heal itself. Addison runs and hides in a field where she is found by Gaylen and Buddy. The Creeper later returns to Gaylen's house where he finds a sign that says, 'We know what you are', along with the hand, and howls in anger. The next day, Addison bids Buddy farewell before he leaves for a high school basketball game in the same bus that is attacked by the Creeper shortly before its hibernation. Twenty-three years later, Trish Jenner (Gina Philips) is seen writing an open message online calling for people to fight against the Creeper when it returns and vows to get revenge for the death of her brother, Darry. Also starring Meg Wright as Gracie Mathers, Michael Sirow as Michael Miller, Thomas Francis Murphy as Mr. Bernardi and Carrie Lazar as Beth Mathers. Nothing has changed, the Creeper is still as vicious as before, with its large wings and tearing people apart to feed, the violence is the big draw, there are one or two exciting enough chases as well, but the story of trying to stop the monster for good could have been better, an alright horror.

Real, genuine scares, not cheap jump scenes! And don't get me started on the Creeper! Also, the cast of the first film does an amazing job. Just unbelievable!And we skip part 2 in order to reach the 3rd one faster: cartoon characters that do nothing more than die. Horrible special effects, complete lack of belief in the monster and let's not forget the new add on to the series: booby traps! All over! As many as possible! And of course the Creeper itself gets these new uber powers, him and his truck also. He becomes something like Hulk in an Iron man suit I think. Overall, if you are a die hard fan of the series, you'll watch this no matter what. It feels like after Alien 1 and 2, they throw in Alien 3. And they expect you to like it as well. Just go with it..All in all, a fourth movie is in talks. It looks like they chose to return to form. Problem is this one did so bad, I'm pretty sure the hype will die out. Even finance should be a problem. They can't use the same camera work they did in this one. It's a disaster. And so many cut scenes it feels like the job is just not finished yet.

After watching the film my wife and I basically looked at each other scratching our heads and wondering what Victor Salva was thinking. I know there were issues getting the money for the film and his original idea was changed for whatever reason. To us this film here was pretty darn confusing on many levels and we both thought it was pretty poor as well.It's really too bad that this film ended up so bad because there were countless storylines that they could have followed and I think they just picked a bad one. The idea of placing this after the events of part one and before the events of part two just led to some logical issues but I'm not going to get into any spoilers here. You can tell that the film was hampered with a low-budget and there are several scenes that have some really poor CGI. The film also stays away from any sort of bloodshed so I'm guessing that they were hoping for a PG-13 rating to try and draw more people.The biggest issue with the film is the script, which doesn't offer up a very interesting idea. I mean, had the film focused on bounty hunters going after the monster then perhaps this would have made for more entertainment. Instead we got several other storylines brought into it including a really lame love story between a teen couple. Even worse was the weird old grandmother. None of these stories were all that interesting and put them all together and you've got a film that just drags out to the point where you'll be looking at your clock quite often.I will say that I enjoyed Stan Shaw and wish he had more to do in the picture. The rest of the cast are good enough in their roles but lets face it, they really didn't have much to work with. It's really too bad that JEEPERS CREEPERS III turned out so bad because fans have been waiting on it for nearly fifteen-years. The budget was an obvious issue but there's no question that the biggest problem with the story they were trying to tell. In the end, we learned very little making this film quite pointless.",

The experience at the theater was surprising but also rather annoying as it was packed from some strange Jeepers Creepers fanbase that loved to talk during the quiet parts and laugh during the horror. The film itself had an interesting enough story to entertain for two hours with the benefit of a ton of jump scares. The Creeper (Jonathan Breck) returns or maybe he never left as this film picks up directly after the first film. The police surround the Creeper's deadly truck full of booby traps. Sgt. Tubbs (Brandon Smith) calls for the truck to be impounded but they don't realize the Creeper will want the truck back. Sheriff Tashtego (Stan Shaw) leads an elite group that hunts the Creeper.The film quality looked terrible and most of the acting was rough. The Creeper returns to get his truck and kills one of the officers transporting. On a farm, an old woman Gaylen Brandon (Meg Foster) continues to see her dead son much to the dismay of her granddaughter Addison (Gabrielle Haugh). The women are poor and can't afford to feed the horse Addison refuses to sell. Gaylen tries to tell Addison to leave the farm because she is warned by her dead son's ghost that the Creeper is coming. Addison goes to buy hay on credit from Buddy Hooks (Chester Rushing) and his father but stops at her friend's house where her jerk brother Kirk (Ryan Moore) keeps a rabbit trapped in a cage.

Sheriff Dan Tashtego (Stan Shaw) and a team of Creeper-hunters hook-up with Sgt. Tubbs (Brandon Smith) to destroy the flying creature as it terrorizes a farming community in the South. Meg Foster and Gabrielle Haugh appear as a troubled grandmother and mopey granddaughter respectively. Chester Rushing plays the latter's wannabe boyfriend. I can see why some would be disappointed by this flick: (1.) The story opens in an unnecessarily convoluted manner. (2.) Until the climax, the Creeper appears mostly in broad daylight, which naturally takes away from the creature's mystique. (3.) The Creeper now has his own eye-rolling 'Mystery Machine' with built-in weapons and defenses. (4.) While the movie teases us with explaining the Creeper's origins, it doesn't deliver. Instead, the ending (with a cameo from Gina Philips from the first installment) is a lead-in to a possible fourth movie.Addressing these criticisms: (1.) While it's true that the story begins in a convoluted manner, everything eventually comes together and makes sense, sort of. (2.) Yes, the Creeper loses his mystique, but the daytime sequences can be defended on the grounds that the Creeper only has 23 days every 23 years to conduct his diabolical business; thus it makes sense that he'd be active day and night, not just night. Besides, there are several night scenes. (3.) I agree that the Creeper's vehicle is too cartoony and it takes away from any sense of genuine horror, but it provides the opportunity for some slasher thrills. (4.) I was anticipating discovering the secrets of the monster and so was disappointed that its genesis wasn't explained, BUT this compels me to see the next (and presumably final) movie, IF there is one.In other news, the female cast is scant, but Gabrielle Haugh certainly makes up for it with her tight jeans in the last 10-15 minutes, lol. THE FILM RUNS 100 minutes and was shot entirely in Louisiana (St. Francisville, New Roads, Ethyl, Jackson and Baton Rouge). GRADE: C+",

As most movies go, the sequels tend to make things worse with the more numbers they add to the end; especially with horror. I've been keeping my eye on this one for years as it was continually rumored on IMDb forums (R.I.P. \u2013 but that's another post for another time). Victor Salva finally decided it was time to revive The Creeper (aka Victor's alter ego). I have something lined up to discuss the directors background a little more, but for this post I'd like to focus on the movie. I'm going to keep the spoilers to a minimum but be warned there will be a few minor ones.The Good: If you watched the first Jeepers Creepers and remember The Creeper's bad ass meat wagon \u2013 it's back. Not only is it back but it's got all sorts of fun little devices that make his hunting just a little more vicious. Plus, I think it answers a few questions as to why nobody has ever made it out of the truck alive, even if they went in as such. It does make you suspend disbelief a bit with some of its features and make you ask yourself more than a few questions; but then again, you're also watching a movie about a winged creature that regenerates parts from eating people, so remember that.Speakin' of that handsome devil, I think he looked much better in this than in Jeepers Creepers 2. He just looked like some weird, naked lizard and I appreciate that they made an effort to rectify that a bit in the new movie. Most of the characters in this aren't much to speak of nor do any of them have the kind of charm that Justin Long had in the first but there were a couple worth mentioning. The Creeper hunting squad leader (Danny) is a pretty likable fellow along with his counterpart Sgt. Tubbs who provides some comic relief.The Bad: Usually when a character is added in as comic relief it's because the movie is too heavily weighing in one specific direction and needs the levity. The problem with the comic relief in Jeepers Creepers 3 is that the whole movie felt like more of a comedy than a horror and it didn't need the extra comic relief added in. Some of the laughs were intentional, but I found that people were laughing at parts of the movie not intended to be (usually from bad slow- motion scenes). The whole movie reeked of a straight to video or bad SyFy original. It's very unfortunate that this movie fell so far from the tree, where the first delivered true terror and an atmospheric creepiness that resonated for days.After 14 years I was shocked that this movie felt rushed and under-budgeted. Not rushed in the sense that the pacing was too fast but just that the story seemed disjointed right out of the gate. It kicks off with \"23 years later\" but then immediately puts you in the aftermath of when The Creeper flew off at the end of the first one. By the end it segues into the second movie.Now, it's been some years since I've watched Jeepers Creepers 2 but I don't recall any of the kids on the bus knowing what the **** it was they were actually dealing with (other than the girl who had the vision of Derry). I have a bone to pick here; why would one of the surviving kids of this attack not immediately tell everyone, \"oh **** I just dealt with this thing like a day ago!\". It's bad storytelling is what it is, and an unnecessarily shoehorned way to connect all three movies. Then before they roll credits, it turns out the \"23 years later\" part is intended to indicate the person who narrated the beginning and end. It then leaves it somewhat open for another installment. Which, bad news Victor, but I don't think that's happening any time soon. Rant over.This sequel didn't add on anything that we didn't already know. I can get on board with a sequel so long as it expands upon what we already know, even if it's just a little bit. I wasn't expecting to find out where The Creeper went to school and learned all of his nifty sewing tricks, but at least throw your audience a bone every now and again. All we really learn is that it (he?) apparently gets very sad and goes on a crow genocide when he has to destroy old limbs. Which I won't spoil exactly what's involved with that, but I'll just say the fact that this plot device wasn't used to give the audience a little more history into The Creeper was a huge miss.The Judgment: At this point it's no secret that I wasn't a fan of this movie. It failed to deliver on multiple fronts which makes me reconsider why they really gave this a limited release. I could have forgiven some bad CGI and slow-motion effects for a good, creepy story. I'm hoping that the next sequel for this movie stays on forums as a theory and never makes it to production. If you're really curious and were a fan of the other two movies, it might be worth the couple bucks you'll pay at Redbox for a bad horror movie night.See this and other reviews at TheCynicist.com Edited for IMDb",

            "content": "This underrated horror series is not going to appeal to all tastes, but this third installment absolutely delivers the goods for fans of the series. The Creeper returns, as does Jonathan Breck playing The Creeper, with series writer/director Victor Salva recounting the events between the first two films, which involves a small town sheriff and a team of Creeper Hunters led by Stan Shaw taking down this flesh and blood urban legend. I think what I like most about this series is that it's basically a straightforward monster movie set-up, but each film stands apart from the one preceding it. The first film was more of a creepy \"Children of the Corn\" like rural urban legend story. The second film was more of an action packed horror suspense film. This third film combined those two elements, adding onto the lore surrounding The Creeper while also providing a number of suspenseful and scary action set pieces. The budget on \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" is noticeably smaller than the previous films, but it's nonetheless an effective horror film that's filled with suspense, action, and send-a-chill-up-your-spine horror imagery. It's also a lot of fun to see the return of the BEATINGU truck driven by The Creeper from the first film. Overall, the third entry is not as frightening as the first film and is not as large of scale as the second film, and is easily the weakest of the three, but it's still a wildly fun horror film for genre fans.",

Now, having seen Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017) I thought this movie was bad but in an entertainingly bad way.The Creeper in this movie is still scary and still played well by Jonathan Breck. The problem is that the Creeper is too over exposed in broad daylight most of the movie, which makes it look funny and less threatening when he is attacking people.The acting in the movie is not good, and the characters make dumb choices that I was getting me annoyed most of the time. The characters do not have good dialogue and I was just waiting for the Creeper to kill them in entertaining ways that was stupid but worth looking at.There are slow moments and random moments that would happen. There are uses of CGI that I noticed that looked fake and less practical, it is also laughable to look at especially on how obvious the CGI looks bad looking and obvious in how they use it along with weird editing.Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017) was not as good as the first two Jeepers Creepers movies, but if you want an entertainingly bad horror movie with over-the-top moments then this movie will give you what you are looking for.",

Overall, it was a silly movie, that I still don't understand how it was connected with the previous movies. Moreover, it was so boring (especially, the last 40 minutes). The ending wasn't very well explained, it was so complicated. Actually, I didn't really care what was gonna happen, lol.

The film is a bridge between Jeepers Creepers and Jeepers Creepers 2.Verdict: Victor Salva directs his third film of the franchise, and very soon he will be filming the concluding fourth film. He directs fluidly and shows no sign of rust. I am always impressed by his style of direction and the background music of his films. The rest of the support cast is decent but not extraordinary. The special effects are a mix of C.G.I. and real costumes and creature props. Jonathan Breck plays the role of the Creeper for the third time. The pacing of the film is fast and we and never left for a dull moment in the film. Overall I give a score of 6.5/10 and consider it a decent prequel to Jeepers Creepers 2.",

            "review_title": "A review of \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" (2017)",
            "content": "Jeepers.The first two \"Jeepers Creepers\" movies are vastly underrated classics, in my opinion \u2014 they're well scripted and boast a truly original and frightening bogeyman. The third, regrettably, struggles to retain even a B movie charm. It's a substandard horror film that I'd only grudgingly rate a 4 out of 10.\"Jeepers Creepers 3\" (2017) is cloddishly written and awkwardly filmed. The film also suffers from action sequences that are absolutely cartoonish. A lot of this stems from the titular Creeper's antique vehicle, which is now inexplicably depicted as being \u0085 conscious? Possessed by the Creeper? It drives itself, deflects bullets, launches projectiles, and contains booby traps that defy physics. This leads to some Wile E. Coyote-style fight scenes with the story's various protagonists, in which the saddest victim is the franchise's credibility.About those protagonists \u2014 there are far too many to examine with any real success; the two ostensible teenage main characters fall a bit flat. There are so many characters that have backstories connected with the Creeper (and his signature, decades-hopping supernatural murder sprees) that the film simply becomes confusing. And that confusion is made worse by this film's chronology with the previous movies \u2014 it takes place immediately after the first, but before the events of the second. (In all fairness, maybe the problem is me \u0085 I am being quite honest when I write here that I just do not follow movies as well as other people.)With all of this exposition, though, one bit of lore is egregiously omitted \u2013 contrary to some of the movie's advance press, we learn nothing about the creature's origins. And this is extremely odd, because a bunch of characters do. There is a befuddling central plot point where the good guys methodically gain knowledge of their otherworldly foe by \u0085 touching one of its severed body parts. But we, the viewers, learn nothing.Even the makeup and special effects were inferior to the prior films.I'm confused by all of the things I've written above, as \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" was written and directed by Victor Salva, who wrote and directed the excellent previous movies in 2001 and 2003.I hope I'm not being too hard on the movie, because there's still some fun to be had. Jonathan Breck still chews the scenery quite nicely as the Creeper, and the monster's character concept still manages to please. In a horror movie market often dominated by seemingly interchangeable serial killers and undead little girls, the Creeper is a truly inventive monster \u2014 part human; part gargoyle; part body-stealing feral, Frankenstein's monster. He's fun to watch, particularly for horror fans who've grown tired of the Patrick Batemans and the various angry ghost children that endlessly haunt the zeitgeist. You could do a lot worse for a plot-driving antagonist.And, thanks to so brutal a bad guy, there are occasional moments of tension in the movie. It's genuinely scary, for example, when he attacks a group of teenaged motorcyclists.This isn't enough to make recommend paying for the movie, however \u2014 even if you're a fan of the franchise, as I am. I'd wait for \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" to hit Netflix or Hulu, or wait until it's playing on SyFy again.",

            "content": "I don't really understand why so many people hated this movie. But, since the vast majority of the people who will read the reviews for this film are doing so to have their own negative opinions validated, we'll start with the things I didn't like:1) The acting was hit-or-miss. Some of the characters I enjoyed and was rooting for, while there were others I was just waiting to fall victim to the Creeper.\n2) I'm not a huge fan of the multiple daytime scenes with the Creeper. I feel that he's best represented in the shadows of the night. That being said, the Creeper is at a place where most horror franchises wind up. The more of a villain you see, the less frightening and intimidating they become. The Creeper is kind of on the border of that; he needs to be treated carefully going forward or he could easily wind up being satirical (think along the terms of the later Elm Street sequels pre New Nightmare).\n3) I'm not a fan of the Creeper's red shirt. It just doesn't suit the character well, I thought.\n4) It's not quite the film Victor Salva wanted to give fans of the franchise, and it shows. The original Jeepers Creepers 3 was subtitled Cathedral, and the script for that original concept has been leaked online to show a much more complex movie that would've relied on a special effects budget much higher than the film could generate. If the stories circulating around the internet are factual, securing funding for this film was a major issue, resulting in Salva watering the script down to something to fit the budgetary restrictions. Some liberties were taken with the Creeper as a character and the things it's capable of doing, which were off-putting but, ultimately, this movie is a good example of working with what you have available to you, however little that may be. This film would've worked better as a sequel versus a prequel, showcasing a more technologically evolved Creeper in the next 23-year cycle.That being said, what I enjoyed about this movie - and what led to me giving it such a high rating - is pretty simple: I just enjoyed the movie. It was a fun slasher from start to finish. It was as different from the other films as Jeepers Creepers 2 was to the original. It takes the character of the Creeper, includes enough of the previous entries in the franchise to please the fans, while at the same time telling a fresh and relevant story in an interesting way.\nVictor Salva, for all the controversy against him and all the protests, has proven yet again what an incredibly gifted writer and director he is. I only hope he keeps Cathedral on the shelf for consideration as a fourth part down the road.Final note: without spoiling anything, I love that Victor leaves this film open-ended. He famously set the 23-year rule as a way of ensuring no sequels would be made (something Francis Ford Coppola managed to exploit to get the sequel), but at this point he seems to have fully embraced the fact that the Creeper is a popular figure in the horror movie universe and that, as long as there's an audience for horror, people are going to want to see more of the character. This film doesn't leave you with the question of whether or not there will be a sequel; it pumps you up for a sequel that's almost certainly in the works right now. So, despite it not being the film Salva wanted to give his fans initially, it's still a pretty fantastic and entertaining bit of horror.",

To be honest, it's not as scary as the original, as expected, but I would go as far as to say it's the best entry in the franchise due to the story being intrinsically well written with plenty of clues about the Creepers origins to keep you entertained and thinking.Picking up right after the first film, Sgt Tubbs and his officers find the Creepers Truck outside in the parking lot and realize it's booby-trapped with spikes that shoot down for anyone stupid enough to stick there head through the back door. It drops explosive bombs that act as homing devices and it's bulletproof. Sheriff Teshtago arrives and explains to Tubbs that he saw the Creeper 23 years knows about the beast. A tow truck hauling the Creepers truck turns deadly when he drops on the back, severs the cables and makes his appearance on top of his truck sporting a snazzy new red shirt and his axe.Gaylen Brandon is one of the interesting characters. She is the grandmother of, Addie (Gabrielle Haugh), who is a character that has a dark and sad history as she lives with her grandmother on a farm, on the verge of insolvency. Gaylen routinely shouts at a ghost only she can see, who turns out to be her son, Kenny (Jordan Salloum). If you remember in the original movie, he was mentioned along with his girlfriend, Darla at the beginning. He warns her that 23 years before something happened and before the Creeper could find something Kenny found and stashed away, he was killed and the Creeper ran out of time before he could find it. Gaylen, needing to know what her son was killed for digs up a relic and discovers the secret behind her son's death.A lot of fuss is made about the relic buried on Gaylen's farm and serves as the second act of the picture while the Creeper terrorizes the local townsfolk. The relic suggests that we will get to learn the dark secrets about the Creeper and provide some information on how he came to be or what he is. Well, we don't find out anything actually; not even a glimpse of what happens when two characters touch it and fall back into a white-eyed trance. This might upset some fans but it gives you a strong sense of danger and evil when one of the characters who touched the relic acts mysterious when he says \"It's ancient.\" Like he saw something truly evil which works as a strong buildup and it gives you the idea that the Creeper is much bigger than we think and it serves as a ruse for when we do find out what he is, it will be a shocking revelation.Most of the movie has the Creeper running around in the daylight which brings out some flaws but that does not mean the movie is bad, not by a long shot. For one thing, we should be grateful we got the film at all and that means more than the Creepers wings having a few holes in them because the budget is lower than the previous pictures. The Creeper's wings are CGI in some scenes but it's not terrible CGI. Nearing the end of the picture, one of the characters, who spends most of the movie in the back of the Creepers truck hiding is discovered and she manages to outsmart the beast and escape. For those expecting a huge showdown, you're not going to get it. Sheriff Teshtago puts up a strong fight and the Creeper has his way with pretty much everyone except for a few stragglers but we see another side of the Creeper when he finds what he is looking for but also finds something left for him that seriously pisses him off and we see the beast scared as he squeals and crows starting dropping dead around him. Maybe this means something?A lot of the film is fun, exciting and forgivable because we get to explore the monster's romp from 23 years before and with all the clues and the ambiguity left at its peak, it sets up for \"Jeepers Creepers 4\" being the final installment and when we do find out what he is, it won't be a boring revelation since we are left to wonder so much from this picture and that is more effective than a simple \"This is what he is and this is how we kill him.\" like most stupid horror movies do. In the end, someone from the past returns to set up the fourth movie and I don't think we are going to have to wait almost 23 years for it. For what it's worth, \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" beats the Hollywood garbage we have been seeing for many years and it is well made and enjoyable. If we get \"Jeepers Creepers 4,\" it will be a thrilling conclusion.",

First, they never tell you or go into great length to tell you anything about the creeper's origins, reasons for eating or why he even exists. The second is that they did not completely close off the story, in my opinion. I also did not find it as exciting as previous creeper movies, my own perspective on that one. Enjoyable, yes, but I felt as though they could have done more on this one. If there is another creeper movie in the future, I hope it is better than part 3. Left much to be desired for me.",

            "content": "Please Read This Review!!! I've decided to write this review because there is just way too much negative feedback for this movie that's not even close to being justified.This 3rd installment, in my opinion, is very well made. This movie actually answers a lot of questions and the bottom line is \"if you didn't like it - it's probably because you just didn't get it\" - period!!! This movie will make you think (a little) and nowadays people don't want to think at all. People nowadays want to be entertained without having to think or appreciate anything - and that's just nuts.From the very beginning, the movie starts building the blocks as to: what the creeper is, how the creeper thinks, how the creeper works, how the creeper gets around and many other things. The acting is pretty good and there are no \"usual basic type of heroes\". The movie has a very realistic story. If you are what the creeper wants - then you are what the creeper gets - that's it(very real). There is very good character development and there are very solid pieces of information thrown throughout the entire movie done in a very strategic way. I honestly didn't want to leave to go to the restroom as I knew that I would miss something very good and important - and I was right.Bottom line when it comes to the types of watchers of this movie. 1)If you like and appreciate a nicely written horror movie with good acting and a solid story - then this is a great movie. 2)If you are always trying to look for every tiny \"flaw\" in a magician's show or are always looking to laugh so hard that you fall out of your seat at a comedian's show without having to do any kind of thinking - then this movie will not make you happy because you can't appreciate the hard work and thought process that goes into things(ART).To understand \"ART\" you have to be \"SMART\". This movie is \"ART\". It may have a somewhat low budget, It may have unknown actors and It may not have non-stop CGI up the wazoo BUT this movie is \"ART\". I loved it and I can't wait for the bluray/DVD release and the 4th installment.",

            "content": "In short - this film is garbage. Utter garbage. If you liked the original, you'll hate JC III. This has all of the look and feel of a TV Movie, or a low budget film that was sent straight to DVD. The story is utterly lame. There are no shocks in it. It is not creepy in any way. This time, we see an awful lot more of the Creeper and the film-makers have seemingly tried to give it some \"character\" or even some \"back story\". This was such an error. The reason that the first film makes you jump, is because you don't see too much of the Creeper, and know almost nothing about what it is or what it's capabilities are. This changed in JC II - which in part was more of a comedy horror film than an all-out shock-fest, where it was demonstrated that he could be brought down with a large harpoon in the chest, and subsequently in the head (not a spoiler as JC II is 14 years old!). Releasing this nonsense, that supposedly sits between JC and JC II in the timeline makes no sense and offers a few more tricks on the part of the Creeper (various weapons that appear from the truck during the film) to \"spice things up\", but in fact it fails epicly to deliver anything new that's in anyway creepy or scary. Everything is predictable. There are no shocks. Oh, and what was going on with that cameo from Gina Phillips (not a spoiler as she's named in the credits)? A film that takes place \"a day or two\" after the original JC (2001), where Gina is supposedly now a day or two older, but is in fact 16 years older and no longer looks like a teenager (she was in fact in her very early 30's when playing a late teenager in the original JC!), but she now looks like a woman in her 40's (because she is in fact 47 now), but is still trying to pass herself off as a few days older than her persona in the original JC? That was simply moronic. The acting overall is lame and lifeless (Stan Shaw - what happened to you man?). The actors are entirely unable to convey any sense of peril or fear. This is making low-rent movies by the numbers, and I hope it made a big loss so that they don't make anymore of this nonsense. What should they done? Picked up after where JCII ended, with an aged Ray Wise and his son ready to take it on right from the get-go in their barn and see where that went when it awoke - 23 years later. JC III as a storyline was such an error. I fear for JC IV which apparently has been written. If it's set in the same time period, this will be an error too. PS - have a think about where some of these weapons are appearing from on the truck. It's just stupid, if weapons and defence mechanisms entirely defy the laws of Physics. (The Creeper flying not included in this of course!)",

            "review_title": "A Definite Disappointment",
            "content": "I was hoping this film would continue the the story of the Creeper, but it didn't really do much of anything other than to disappoint. There are so many problems with this film that it's hard to list them, but hopefully I can give an idea of the films issues.For anyone who saw Jeepers Creepers 2 and thought this would continue the story from where the guy was sitting and waiting for the Creeper to return, well, it doesn't. In fact, this appears to take place right after Jeepers Creepers 1 as Sgt. Tubbs and the Sheriff say that the kid that was just killed is Darry, who has a sister, and this attack took place in the police station. That would be before Jeepers Creepers 2, which takes place 4 days later, given the news report the kids on the bus are listening to on the radio states the church in Jeepers Creepers 1, was burned four days prior.In this film, the truck is now a player in the story. For me, it doesn't work that well as the truck never seemed anything more than a way for the Creeper to get around and frighten people to smell their fear. Having it be sort of alive doesn't fit the 23 year, 23 day theme of the Creeper, especially since it has been establish in Jeepers Creepers 1 that some of the Creeper's victims are hundreds of years old. The whole idea of the truck being an entity of some sort seems like the writer is trying to do nothing more than to suck up to fans who like the creepy truck instead of actually writing a story that expands upon the true subject the story: the Creeper. But it gets even worse than that with the truck now being invincible and chucked full of unrealistic weapons that fit into impossible spaces. Your basic, cheezy, unimaginative ways for a writer to create suspense with cheap imagery instead of doing it through good story writing that makes for a richer story.One major issue I have with the film is that too much of it was shot during the day. Horror doesn't work that well in daylight. You lose a lot of creepiness that night provides. The makeup job on the Creeper is also lacking. The quality of the makeup in Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2 was very good. This time around it looks like a cheap, pull over latex mask in a lot of shots.There's also the backstory that is eluded to. In the film, one of the characters has a hand that was the Creeper's. When they touch it they are flooded with visions of what the creature is, how old it is and how it was created. Of course we never get fed any of these images, nor are we given any of this information, even though they leave the message, \"We know what you are,\" pinned to the hand with a spike. But that's all we get and it doesn't destroy the Creeper. This type of writing usually is nothing more than to cover up the fact that the writer just couldn't think of anything good.In the end, all we get from this film is that this part of the story happened between the first and second Jeepers Creepers. We learn nothing more about the Creeper, nor do we learn why the truck was impervious to attack and had many weapons that simply appear out of nowhere. All we have is an unimaginative story and a horror film that fails to provide any real horror.",

The Creeper scenes look like they were filmed in a junior high school project from 1992. I could hardly tell what I was looking at in some scenes as they were so dark, that it may have filmed under improper lighting. This actors are very green and some of them looked like they were just hired for being young. The stories are in no way tied to the original films. There is no answers provided for the Creepers origins (and not even a hint in trying to do so....). I waited 14 years for this?? After all the drama about this director, you would have thought he would have put more direction in is writing and at least gave a clear story to follow). The main character Adison is just running around being chased by the Creeper and her potential love interest. Neither of which are compelling or seem to be believable. This whole movie needs to be thrown in the trash where it belongs. I haven't been so excited for a film in a long time, to be totally disappointed in this amateurish attempt. It looked like it was made for YouTube. I had to keep asking myself if this was real, and why they would have even made such a terrible movie. How do you go from 2 great films to this?? I was excited to see the 4th film before seeing this trash, but now I think I will just avoid it and act like this movie never even existed. Victor, you really let your fans down with this. Go back write a REAL story that tells us what the Creeper is, what makes him him, and what his origin is. Quit with the jump scares, its played out from 1989 and on! Go back to the Creeper in the night time and for god sake's give him so level of mystery in the scenes. It was like I put on the Creeper mask and ran around a high school movie set with my friends.

A group of people with intimate connections to the Creeper bond together to stop him.Seeing the first \"Jeepers Creepers\" in theaters as a junior high schooler was something of formative experience for me, and while I don't think the original is a perfect film, it is finely-crafted. The sequel was good (but not great), and this third installment is unfortunately worse. The production values here are clearly hurting\u2014it shows in the special effects particularly, which are both hokey CGI and poor practical effects. It's not surprising to me that many fans of this series have complained about the villain's appearance (which in and of itself is overstated). His face shows on screen more like a mask than anything else, and the monster now has an arsenal of elaborate weapons and his truck now built with souped-up security features that rival those of Fort Knox.That's not even the half of it though. The main problem with \"Jeepers Creepers III\" is that it's spread far too thin, with its script juggling multiple plot lines ineffectively. There are too many characters, too many subplots, and not enough time to connect them in any meaningful way. It becomes weirdly episodic until the last third of the film, and even then, it all seems arbitrary. It almost feels as though Salva was writing the film as he went along, cramming as much as he possibly could for the series' swan song. Even weirder is the attempt to tether the film between the first and the second, which seems narratively inconsistent and tonally unbalanced if nothing else.Meg Foster has the most interesting character in the film, and she is without a doubt the best actress here. The younger supporting cast are serviceable but nothing to write home about; Stan Shaw is also likable as the sheriff and chief hunter of the monster. The finale is rather dull as well, with pacing that resembles everything that's led up to it.In the end, \"Jeepers Creepers III\" is a weak followup to two rather good horror films. The visual effects and repeated slow-motion scenes wear on the senses, and there are far too many narrative strands to accommodate in a runtime under ninety minutes. It is somewhat amusing overall, but ultimately looks and feels like a television film, and fails to offer anything aside from a few mildly fun vignettes. Foster's performance is far better than the material demands, and that is one of the film's few additional strong suits. 5/10.",

As revealed in the comics, the Creeper's evil goes back millennia, demanding Human Sacrifice and having wiped out the local farming community. The Creeper relishes tormenting its victims physically or mentally, and shows no care at its actions once accidentally causing an entire town to be destroyed. Shortly after the events of the first 'Jeepers Creepers' film, the police discover the Creeper's truck filled with dead bodies. It results to be a bizarre truck owned the Creeper (Jonathan Breck) which appears each new 23rd spring, after several years. The truck has been rigged with several booby-traps, including spikes that emerge from the bed of the truck, and a safety system composed of 2 internal sabers and a spear that is ejected from the rear , shooting out from the tail-pipe , in addition to some poles in the doors . After a massacre Sheriff Dan Tashtego (Stan Shaw) arrives, Sergeant Davis Tubbs (Brandon Smith) tells him what happened and Tashtego informs him that the Creeper has been around for thousands of years and must be stopped. Tubbs assembles a task force to destroy the Creeper and they are travelling across the rural South to meet him once and for all , while growing closer than ever before to learning the secrets of its dark origins. He needs humans for a good barbecue and some young riders are menaced by the murderous maniac Creeper, they then flee and looking for to save their own skin , when the cannibal go after them things go awry . Meanwhile, the monster terrorizes a local farm inhabited by Gaylen Brandon (Meg Foster) and her granddaughter Addison Brandon (Gabrielle Haugh) .

            "content": "I feel I should first admit that the first two \"Jeepers Creepers\" movies weren't among my favorite horror movies of all time (though the first one had its moments). Still, I was curious to see what this third entry was like, mainly because the user comments at this web site were so negative about it. Sadly, the other user commenters are correct; this is simply not a good movie at all. I could go on for some time listing what is wrong with this movie, such as the sub-par CGI effects, the absurd abilities of the Creeper, and some really incompetently directed moments. But the biggest problem I had with the movie was that it had a really inconsistent tone and feel. First, the screenplay feels like it was assembled from pieces from two (or more) different screenplays. The story goes way over the map, with lots of padding as well as half-baked plot threads and character arcs. Likewise, the movie also feels like it was directed by two (or more) people. There isn't a consistent feel to the movie, and as a result it's hard to get involved with what you are seeing because you don't quite know how you should feel. The only real positive thing to say about the end results is that the photography is pretty good for what had to be a limited budget. But that's not anywhere enough for me to want to see a \"Jeepers Creepers 4\".",

            "content": "Being a fan of the first two installments, I had been looking forward to this third film for years but the release had been delayed multiple times and once it got released it received overtly negative reviews. The film wasn't played in any movie theater near me and once it got released it cost thirty bucks which was way too much in my opinion. I had to wait until very recently to pick the film up for ten bucks and didn't have any expectations anymore at that point.As it turns out, Jeepers Creepers 3 is much better than its reputation. It isn't as atmospheric, creepy and intense as the first film but it's clearly better than the odd second installment in my opinion. A lot of people criticized that the film follows too many characters. I actually think this is a strength that keeps the movie diversified, entertaining and even surprising from start to finish. The different characters also have enough depth to convince. We follow cool black Sheriff Dan Tashtego and a group of citizens who want to see the titular monster dead because they have lost family members and friends to it twenty-three years earlier. Other parts of the movie focus on sharpshooter Sergeant Davis Tubbs who sees his police officers decimated by the mysterious creatures. We encounter mentally unstable farmer Gaylen Brandon who has lost her son to the creature. We meet her solitary granddaughter from a broken family who tries to defy the monster's attacks with the help of a young gentleman who has a love interest in her. The movie also shows what happens to the rude brother of the granddaughter's best friend and his three mates who go on a fateful biking trip. Despite all these story lines, the movie never loses focus or momentum as everything revolves around the titular monster and its gruesome actions. One could actually say the monster is the lead character here.Another element I liked is the importance of the monster's vehicle in this film. It is filled with traps that prevent victims from escaping and others to get inside the vehicle. The vehicle almost seems to be an otherworldly entity which adds a fresh mysterious touch to the franchise.The film is set between the first and the second installment which some people criticized. However, the movie connects all three movies and their characters very well. It gives some more background information on the creature without revealing too much which would be fatal for such a horror franchise.The movie oozes with atmosphere since numerous scenes are set in the disgusting vehicle and because the titular monster gets a lot of screen time and is seen flying, investigating, killing, running and smelling in order to get as many victims as possible. Even though most parts of the movie take place during the day, the film manages to evoke a creepy atmosphere.Despite an abysmal budget, the movie is filmed with care. The special effects look solid and never too artificial. The camera work is calm and not shaky. The sound effects blend in very well. The soundtrack is appropriately chosen for this type of movie. The actresses and actors deliver overall realistic performances.However, the film also has its flaws. First of all, the film fails to surprise and is missing some intriguing twists and turns. The story could have been more imaginative. The conclusion is rather underwhelming and indicates that there might or might not be a sequel at a certain time which is frustrating after a waiting time of a decade and a half between the second and the third installment.Secondly, the movie has a creepy atmosphere but is missing some truly horrifying scares that made especially the first part so intense. This third entry focuses on character development but fails to elaborate upon its horror elements. One could rather describe this film as drama with supernatural elements.Thirdly, the movie obviously hasn't met everybody's expectations and one could have expected something more spectacular after such a long waiting time. The film feels as if it were mostly just trying to cash in on the commercial success of the first two features instead of bringing anything new to the franchise. Don't get me wrong, Jeepers Creepers 3 is still an enjoyable movie in my book, but the delivery is too safe to leave a deeper impression after all.In the end, fans of the franchise should ignore the overtly negative reviews and give this film a fair try without any unrealistic expectations. I'm glad the movie finally saw the light of day and was positively surprised by it. I can't wait to watch the three films in a row in the near future.",

            "content": "Back in 2001, the original 'Jeepers Creepers' presented us with a kind of slasher film, but with enough eccentric twists that ensured it provided something different. Two years later, the sequel undid all the good that was done and gave us a generic runaround peopled with stock characters. It has taken 14 years for this third instalment to appear (set between 1 and 2), and sadly the results are unremarkable.A selection of characters are introduced, the less tolerable of which thankfully emerge simply as ciphers. Other than that group of brattish teen motorcyclists, we have two grizzled old cops: the bejewelled Sheriff Dan Tashtego (Stan Shaw) and Sgt. Davis Tubbs (Brandon Smith); farmer granny Gaylen Brandon (Meg Foster) and her casually stunning grand-daughter Addison (Gabrielle Haugh). Addison's suitor is naturally called Buddy (Chester Rushing), and he is last seen departing for a basketball game in the van that was attacked in Jeepers Creepers 2.The first time we see the Creeper here, he is as we remember him. This time, he is posturing on top of the roof of his van as it slowly drives away into woodlands. You dearly want a low-hung branch to nobble him. His powers have reached a new level, leading to some improbable/ridiculous over-the-top deaths (the double impaling of two of the motor-cycle gang springs to mind). The Creeper somehow lacks the spectacle he did in the first film. Perhaps it is unfair of me to hope for more, but when he spends so much time despatching the motor-cyclists to prove how nasty he is, it's hard to be particularly impressed.His truck is the star of the show here. It's equipped with a CGI-enhanced box of death-dealing tricks Batman himself would be envious of. Instead of making the audience wince, however, the plethora of spikes and lasso mechanisms produce groans.We don't really have time to get to know anyone, each character is fairly generic. This is a real shame as again, the bickering, likeable brother and sister from the original helped make it so enjoyable, because they were real and their dialogue didn't consist solely of 'goddam' and 'son of a bitch' (these are the words that even usher out the film). Events don't flow particularly well, instead they seem cobbled together as if from separate productions. As the running time rolls on, this becomes particularly evident as tone skips from one thing to another with sinking, increasingly dull rapidity. Goodwill on behalf of the audience soon gives way to bafflement and the dawning realisation that this really isn't very good. Director, writer and co-producer Victor Salva must take the blame for much of this - TV movie production standards and most of it occurring during bright sunshine. No real sense of atmosphere, no convincing jeopardy, nothing.Gina Phillips, Trish from the first film, is mentioned at the beginning of this, but doesn't turn up until the very end here.",

I hate to say it, but the only decent thing is the direction, with some solid shots and compositions. This doesn't feel like a film that should have taken place largely in sunny daylight.

            "content": "I just left the theater after seeing jeepers creepers 3 and I have to say that I am extremely disappointed. It wasn't necessarily a bad movie, I have seen worse. But it just didn't deliver after years of waiting. I left the theater with no more knowledge of the creeper or his origin than I did when I went in. The characters in the movie repeatedly let us know that every 23 years for 23 days the creature gets to eat. We KNEW that already, from the other two movies. Another thing that bothered me is the addition of contraptions on the creature's truck that were no where in sight or even hinted at in the first film. He also roars now which is very different than the shriek like sound he makes in the other two films. His appearance is different; he isn't as gross looking in this movie; he is too human like in his moves and demeanor. He could pass for a regular man wearing a mask. He also doesn't seem to be able to tell if a person is dead or alive anymore, even when said person is suddenly unwrapped, still moving when the truck door is opened, and breathing heavily. Victims also now escape for the most part unnoticed, and will barely a scratch. Supposedly this movie takes place the morning after Darry was taken and had his eyes stolen by the creeper. So the creeper snatched Darry, lit a hundred candles, turned on a record player, carved out the back of Darry's head... All of that which we saw at the end of the first movie. But at the same time he was stealing his truck back from the people on the tow truck, all in the same night? How did he manage to find the time? Unnecessary love story and other plot points that serve no purpose or that are left unexplained. Characters making the dumbest decisions that no real person would make. Plenty of jump scares. Attempt at a twist ending involving the bus from the second film. Seems like there may be a sequel in the works. If so I'll wait for the DVD next time. Very disappointed.",

This film needed editing on a school level. There were so many plot holes and the tie ins were tenuous, at best. I'm still confused if the kid at the end who got on the bus was supposed to tie in to part 2...where was he in part 2 and why didn't any of the kids know what was going on...as he would, because he'd just lived through an encounter with The Creeper?Jonathan Breck, once again, puts on a stellar performance as The Creeper. No one could possibly pull off a better job. But what was with the red shirt? Stan Shaw put in an excellent performance and Brandon Smith's great performance will probably go mostly unnoticed too.Worth a watch...just don't expect a lot and you won't be disappointed.

First of all, I've seen a lot of bad reviews for this movie and also about the director's past. Anyway, I'm not here to do a review of the director's life. I'm here to do a review of this third chapter in the series. It's a direct sequel to the first chapter and it's really scary good, with eerie elements from part 1 and straight up action from part 2. It combines great performances from the legendary Meg Foster as Gaylen Brandon, Stan Shaw as Sheriff Dan Tashtego, the one and only Jonathan Breck, reprising his role as The Creeper, and also a big surprise cameo at the end. The practical effects were awesome and the CGI effects were not that bad, compared to a lot of the overrated bullshit that Hollywood produces in this day and age. I really loved the scenes where the scary stuff is happening in daylight, with action-packed and heart pounding scenes. Plus, some of the scenes were captured in slow motion, which I thought was really cool.

What possible \"origin\" can be thought of about a creature that it's one of it's kind, can't die and apparently uses magic (he extends his arm from a far, body lifts up and the axe goes back to it)? There is no \"origin\" for that. And the ones who \"saw it\", still couldn't figure out how to kill it. Because even the writers don't know how to kill it. They created such a character that even they can't figure out. As a writer myself - that must hurt, especially with a large fan base that expects explanations, which they can't give.Btw, poor dude that plays Creeper. I'm sure after 2 movies, he got to know his character. And now he couldn't play the REAL Creeper, but this poor sad sack that just whines and growls for literally no reasons whatsoever. He couldn't even do \"sniff and pick\". They made him go around killing people for fun, even though Creepers DOESN\"T do that!

A truck that attacks cops and contains dozens of corpses is practically ABANDONED by cops, towed away like some ordinary vehicle by just two of them. DUMB.2. The demon leaves the two cops - then comes back. Why did he leave in the first place? Why did he kill just one of them? Demons work in mysterious ways.3. And why does the female cop point her gun at him - while he's killing another cop - yet doesn't shoot? This is a COP, aren't they supposed to be trigger-happy? If there is anything that should trigger the happiness to pull the trigger, it's facing a demon. Hasn't Hollywood's Left been telling us for decades that American cops can't wait to kill someone? DUMB.4. Why isn't the army involved? The cops use an ancient machine-gun instead, as if the military is too busy to send troops to help out this town. Because OBVIOUSLY every little town should be able to handle a major supernatural threat on their own, without pestering the Pentagon for help.5. The four teens discovering the truck - a fun scene but so stupid.6. \"No phone service here\". Really? 2017, and still we have the new-old \"can't get a signal here\" baloney. Horror writers and mobile phones: they just can't seem to solve that obstacle. Writers of thrillers and horrors must hate mobile phones.7. OK, fine, we know the demon is powerful and a world-class athlete and all, but how the hell did it manage to impale both teens with one spear throw when the teens were running away next to each other as opposed to one behind the other? Even \"Transporter 3\" doesn't play around with basic laws of physics to such a silly extent.8. That stupid argument between the cops over the demon's severed hand. There are better ways to do exposition. And there are times when no exposition is needed: we get it, the hand is key, stop boring us with nonsense.9. The fat cop's only purpose seems to be to be a nuisance and for others to waste screen time trying to convince him to get on with the program.10. Does the guy who directed/wrote this even know how a ricochet works? Ricochet doesn't mean \"goes back to sender\" as Salvo seems to believe. Pretty silly.11. The truck driver turns his back on the monster to phone the cops. Why must everyone be an imbecile, Salvo?Despite being stupid, it's not an awful movie because it isn't too boring and visually it avoids the modern trappings of being mono-colour. It's refreshing to see a normal-looking horror film that isn't filmed through drab blue-grey filters. Would have been a tighter film if it'd been trimmed 15 minutes or so; lousy useless dialog and other nonsense waste screen time.",

Of course this didn't happen. This time the local characters battle Creepers by eventually forming a last minute plot to kill it, the problem isn't just that the characters impetuousness does not happen as fast or effective as it should or the needless dialogue, the problem is mainly they lost the intensity, the hairs on neck raising fear factor the original had and therefore instead what we got was more like a low budget college made film with dodgy acting.Hopefully the fourth will be better suited to what the usual horror marathon quick to judge keyboard warriors will approve of. These people didn't like the first two not just this one.

My favorite of the three movies is the second one because of all the gory and creative kill scenes. This installment is a continuation of the first movie,which i thought would be interesting but there were too many sub plots..none of them interesting.I never cared about any of the characters.I hate a movie that drags out sub plots.Again i have to say my biggest complaint is the monster himself.....why did they make him seem like a human serial killer? Why did they drag out the sub plots instead of setting up an interesting movie from the beginning? I shut the movie off three quarters of the way through..i didn't care to see the ending.",

We never actually get to hear it's song at all for some reason and serves as a secret prequel to 2.The thing about this is I could see the directors trying to make this film different than the others. They tried as hard as they could yet it doesn't really beat the expectations of 1 or 2 still.The thing that ticked me off is we don't get to see it's origins.This film was a very well driven plot that doesn't meet my expectations even though they tried to make us viewers like it.

I don't think anyone is interested in what was happening between the first and second movie. Maybe I was disappointed so much because I expected sequel not prequel. In addition, I think that the audience would be much more interested in knowing what happened after the second part when they killed Jeepers Creepers. Perhaps Salva choose that period for third part because he wanted to make another one.

Another positive is some(attempt at) character development similar to Part 1. More screen time for creeper than probably both movies put together, which is awesome. Not every thing is rosy though...acting, especially that of the lead actress was wooden at best. Some claims which Salva made about the movie were not true, which was a huge disappointment for me.

Much like the others, this one manages to really get a lot to like out of it's stellar and chilling action scenes. Carrying on the scenes from part one, the opening attempt to investigate the police station massacre where they notice the booby-trapped truck, followed up by its eventual retrieval on the fog-enshrouded backroads right out from under the witnessing officers, gives this the kind of early start that's usually featured in these efforts. Likewise, the battle against the dirt-bikers out in the remote woods has some fantastic action with the spring-loaded trap and the eventual dispatch of the group as they make their escape, the ambush at the farmhouse where it strikes the group trapped at the location and the big rescue mission at the end where it really kicks off with the creature taking the bodies to his hideout and the encounter in the truck to the police assault in the woods and finally leading into the chase down the highway and the ensuing battle in the fields serves this one rather nicely. While these here really make this one enjoyable, there are a few minor issues to be had here. The main issue with the film is the rather off-beat pacing that occurs throughout here, which tends to give this a really uneven tone. The film starts off rather strong with the police station ambush and then tends to meander around with the small-town community and their relationships which runs through way too many plot lines to really matter here, from the family going under and the attempted romance of the two as well as the secret history of the creature which is too convoluted to really make much of a difference here in giving this one much of a cohesive feel here. These just drag out what's going on into being stuck without too much going on, and the lack of explanations to it all really enhances that problem even more since nothing is given why these events mean anything. That this also manages to keep the titular Creeper off-screen for a large portion of it's running time is another issue since he's not as involved with the story as often as the other films had him which does lead to some overall bland sections of the film. The last big issue here is the general backstage problems associated with it which might make it hard to get through if that appeals to you, but in terms of on-screen problems, the other issues are what hold it down.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",

Jeepers Creepers 2 was more commercial and seemed to have the usual teenagers being picked off story line but was still done well and was a good movie. Jeepers Creepers 3, it saddens me to say, is a pile of s**t. The story is so all over the place. There are way too many characters, most of whom are completely unlikable. We are introduced to a crack creature hunter team complete with skull with bat wings symbol on their shoulder which didn't amount to anything. They took elements of the second film e.g. the truck with the post driver mounted on back and put it in this movie just instead of a post driver it's some kind of gun. There was way too much focus on the creatures truck which they made indestructible (i kid you not). They gave the creature a Thor type ability with his axe where he held out his hand and the axe returned to him??? And probably the most confusing/annoying aspect of this movie was 2 scenes over about 10 minutes where the \"crack creature hunting team\" has one of the creatures discarded hands which if you touch shows you the creatures origins and possibly how to kill it. 2 people go through the process of holding the hand and having the visions, the only problem is they in know way elaborate on what the people saw/felt/experienced. All we see is their eyes roll back in the heads and then afterwards they are drained and exhausted, and it's never focused on again, ARE U SERIOUS?? \nThis movie was a train-wreck. Of all the things they could do, all the ideas you could have and new directions for the Creeper, this was the best they could come up with, a movie based between the 1st and 2nd films with absolutely no point to it.

Why doesn't he just hunt like a predator? Like he does in the first two movies. Is he moving with the times, as well?

            "content": "Jeepers Creepers 3 is terrible and suffers from the downhill sequel problem were it is not fresh with the scares and thrills like the first movie. I was really looking for to the third installment to Jeepers Creepers. I thought the first movie was scary and seeing the creeper for the first time was thrilling. The second film was okay; it lacked scares with more body count deaths. The third film is just boring, the creeper is not as scary, and the plot is an example of terrible lazy script writing. The plot follows right after the events of the first movie and just before the second movie. Where the sheriffs in the small town are shocked by what they saw. The demonic looking creature known as the creeper. They are learning the creepers motives, as it eats every 23rd spring before it goes back to hibernation for another 23 years. And this creature is unstoppable as it replaces its own body parts from the victims he eats. This film feels like a in between transition from the two movies. Which provides nothing new to what we already know with the creeper. It introduces us to some teens and young adults that mess around with the creepers beat up truck. And they get caught as prey from the creature. The script writing is pure lazy, were the plot is just horrible. We see a farm lady, were her son was killed from the creature 23 years ago, and learns that the arm that the son buried is the key to stopping the creature. Or is it? The film spends most of the time with the police and sheriff debating and figuring out what this creature is and how to kill it. And it gets very boring from here. Then, there are four teenagers that mess around with the creepers truck and hunted down by the creeper. And we have an abused young teen that lives with her grandmother and is also hunted down by the creeper. This film also lacked scares. There were no thrills or jump scares. Unless you find seeing the creeper running after someone with his odd looking axe or coming for an attack from flying. There was also no character development, making the characters even difficult to care or even know these characters name in the movie which you don't. The shock factor was there for the first movie. Maybe because you see a guy that looks and dresses in a dirty trenchcoat. And driving a beat up truck and finding out it is no man but a creeper. And looking like a demonic beast that never dies. It was all there for the first movie which made it scary. The element of surprise with the creeper is gone with this film which does not add anything to provide scares. Overall, Jeepers Creepers 3 is a bad horror film. The direction and script is terrible and lacked everything from scares, plot, and character development. It was boring mostly. I rate the film 2 out of 5 stars. I would not recommend the film unless you're bored than wait for it on tv or rental.",

            "content": "Friday Night Is Fright Night so I was happy to see that two of the better fright films have new Chapters to their stories. Therefore, I was looking forward to watching both this movie and the gorefest Jigsaw... How dismayed I was.I love the original Jeepers Creepers, which is well filmed and full of atmosphere and tension. Even the sequel wasn't too bad, which is to be expected as JC's creator, Victor Salva, had written and directed both. And since this is his baby also what could go wrong?Well, pretty much everything.For one thing, there was very little creepiness around and only a smidgen of tension. This could be because Salva opted to film most of the scenes in glorious daylight. As is shown numerous horror films, This is a hard choice for the directors as it becomes harder to create an intense nervousness and the eeriness the genre thrives on. So, instead of getting the audience on the edge of their seats; they're nearly put to sleep watching an unoriginal bate and catch hunter flick. The bright sunlight also shows the daemon in all its glory. Unfortunately, it also renders him unscary. At least in the darker shadows of the night, the audience can let their minds and imagination run riot. This is better than most writers can script as it allows the viewer to add personal elements to the fear. Don't get me wrong there are a couple of scenes that really work well. My favourite of which is the duel between JC and Sheriff Tashtego. There are some nice shots here; The silhouette shot with the sun behind JC and the distant shot at the end of the duel. However, there are too few of this style of shot to keep interest high. I think that if we actually saw JC feeding, as is stated he does though we hardly ever see, this extra bit of gore, if filmed correctly, would at least have added a bit of tenseness.As for the story, it's basically still the same time period of the first film; this is just a few more days of his 23-day killing and feeding spree. However, there's now an elite group of Creeper hunters, who have now turned up on the scene. This is the part of the story I found far-fetched. JC comes out every 23 years in a different part of America, to kill and feed. We don't even know how long he's been doing this, so it seems very unlikely that news of him would have got out and about, especially to the point where a hunting team would be patrolling for him. To make this believable we needed more background on JC and the hunters themselves. The only part I found entertaining, in a good way, was Meg Foster as Gaylen Brandon, the grandmother medium, being haunted by her dead son, who had been killed by JC. This story arc was good'ish and wove into the main easily, though it didn't go far enough. It should have added a lot more to the mythos of JC but for some reason, Salva decided not to pursue this line, which in turn weakened the story and film. There's a section where both Gaylen and the Sheriff touch a remanent of JC and supposedly see just what the creature is and how to stop it. Unjustifiably, neither one of them talk about it or share the knowledge with the rest of the soldiers on how to kill it, which in the long run appears to be inconsequential to JC anyway.Then there's the acting... Apart from Meg Foster, the rest of the cast are well below par in this film. I've watched Stan Shaw (Sheriff Tashtego) in other roles and I've always enjoyed his performance. Except that in this flick he doesn't appear to get in touch with his inner Tashtego and just opts to shout a lot. The worst for this is Michael Sirow as Miller. Miller is meant to be holding a deep-rooted anger for JC after watching him rip his father's heart out of his chest. Though what we get is just the shouting without the emotion.I'd only recommend that followers of the Jeepers Creepers Saga should watch this one, though only if there's nothing else worth watching... like the original Jeepers Creepers, which is way superior to this one.",

            "content": "Victor Salva's 'Jeepers Creepers' series has got quite the cult following amongst horror fans. While watching the original (starring Justin Long and Gina Philips) may still startle some of us fanboys, the wait had been indefinitely long for a sequel to the much inferior 'Jeepers Creepers 2'. Not a lot seems to have changed as the story of JC 3 is still stuck in 2001, and occurs between the events of part one and two. So no marks for predicting how it all transpires.A minor character from part one - Officer Tubbs (Brandon Smith) plays a meatier role in this film albeit not adding much other than delivering clich\u00e9d lines coupled with constipated expressions. Tubbs is tagged along with Sheriff Tashtego (Stan Shaw) in a quest to end the Creeper's murderous rampage. Then there are other characters, like Gaylen (Meg Foster), her granddaughter Addison (Gabrielle Haugh), her love- interest Buddy (Chester Rushing) set in a farming community targeted by the Creeper.It looks like a case of too many protagonists yet no solid one worth backing. Most set-pieces take place during broad daylight, completely shutting out the 'surprise attack' element. JC 3 almost feels like a badly done straight-to-television action flick than a horror thriller with solid build-up. The CGI is appalling - very powdery (even the blood). The special effects totally befit a TV venture than something big-screen. Even the make-up and costumes for Jonathan Breck's Creeper don't evoke any intrigue. Much of the screenplay would barely make sense to franchise-newbies while fans would feel letdown considering the fact that there's hardly any backstory attributed to the Creeper, even three films in. A couple of impalement scenes are the only occasions where I kind of savored the ordeal. I wish there were references to the 'feasting ritual' of the Creeper - even a few red-herrings would have sufficed. In the film, the team out to get the Creeper act like they know pretty much everything about what's going on but know very little in actuality. In an era where horror movies come out dime a dozen, it'd be hard to even twitch for the supposed 'jumpscares' in this film. Salva needs to acknowledge that it is really difficult to satisfy horror buffs these days - shoving some cheap nonsense in the face of the viewers and deeming it horror just isn't enough. The film ends with the tease of a fourth instalment - I feel it is less likely to take shape, given Salva's history, this terrible threequel, and fans not giving a damn anymore.Verdict: Re-watch the first film instead!",

I was only 7 years old at the time, so it had a lasting impact on me. I only saw what Jonathan Breck looked like without the creeper make up last year when i did a random google search of him after hearing about this film. The second one was definitely less scary but still had some thrills and exciting action set pieces. This third entry is as big a step down as is seemingly possible. Every decision that could have been made to make the film scare free and boring was made. Giving the Creeper a \"Wesley Snipes Blade Trinity\" red shirt for no particular reason (A shirt he must have picked out at the end of JC1 then decided wasn't his style at the end of this film seeing as he does not wear it in JC2) Having him appear in broad daylight for the first time, making his make up appear sillier and taking away his menace. And having him fly around in CGI that could have been cooked up by a film school student on his day off. I really could continue for about 9,000 more words of all the other mistakes this movie makes but I'll summarise the rest.There is virtually no plot or character development. A bunch of random people in a town come across the creeper and end up like all his other friends in the cave from JC1. We learn little about any of them and feel nothing as they become the creeper's lunch. We get frustratingly close to figuring out where it comes from but are denied entry, continuing the unwelcome Hollywood trend of just answering all those questions in a sequel which may never arrive. Why didn't they just answer all of it in this one? I mean seriously this could have tied together the story of the first 2 movies in a perfect thread but instead rips it open and leaves gaping holes, messing with the continuity, mythology and atmosphere of the series.You will not be scared watching this movie. If you haven't seen it yet. Don't. Some of the best horror movies have been made in the last few years. Seek them out and get the scares this movie will never fulfil. Watch Gerald's Game or Don't Breathe. Not this. Wow. Just wow.",

Then came this one and ... I just don't know what to make of it except wrong, wrong, wrong. I tried to make heads or tails of it and couldn't.This was a total miss.I've never done this in a review but for me to write this, I read what others wrote to try to understand why I was so bugged by this. Many said this was taking place BETWEEN I and II so I thought that would make a bit more sense to me. It didn't. But that is only a bit that made it more disjointed. The special effects were also off for me. I was watching it and thinking that was the mark of a first time director throwing them in almost anywhere to make what should have been a tiny action shot more longer and...excruciating.There were actors of which I know their faces more than the names, and knew they are great at their work, but it was all lost here. I was trying to understand why their actions produced the results of the scene I watched. I was lost.Now the part I found entertaining (meaning I laughed cause it was funny) was towards the end when The Creeper got a spike though his head, he lost his eye and tried to throw his javelin with the precision he used to have - and couldn't. There were a few other parts, and they only lasted seconds, but even then, not enough to make this make any type of sense at all.The only thing I could deduce, was that this seemed like a bunch of 'something' scenes that maybe for budget reasons, or time or both -- someone went into the editing room and spliced some parts together and came up with this.How sad.And let me do something I never did in a review talk about how the ending...actually seemed to be a beginning and you could tell for whatever reason, they had to go another way.

If someone doesn't like a film they just put one. I take ratings on things like this serious because can you talk about for example I feel like the Meg, I hated it. It was horrible compared to the novel. But I'm not going to get butt hurt over the fact that I didn't like it and give it a one because if that film is a one, what is a movie like sharknado? What is a movie like me straight to TV sci-fi movies? Is that a one also? It's just not comparable. If you gave this movie A one, what would you give the newest one? You can't go any lower than one but the newest one was way worse than this. Realistically this movie is probably like a six. Any movie that goes into the theaters is automatically at least a four my biggest issue with this and I think what really ruined this movie the most is the budget. If you give this movie a better budget and it had better graphics, I think this movie is much much better. The story is good the ending kind of sucks but it moves the story forward. Had they made a fourth film that actually had Trish Jenner come back, I think this would have been a good film to develop the story into that. There were definitely some potholes and bad graphics but it was very entertaining and there were some cool kills and we learned some new stuff. I would have changed the ending but aside from that and the bad graphic it was a quality sequel. If you watch the newest one, that was horrible movie. Unfortunately the fans of this franchise are getting punished by the doings of the director. The director's past made it so this movie didn't get a budget or get a full release. Dont get me wrong he is a monster and a horrible person but you can love the work of someone who is a horrible person. If Jeffrey Dahmer painted a beautiful picture, it doesn't take away from the fact that he's a monster but you're allowed to like the picture. I wish the director had just stepped aside and allowed someone to make a proper sequel with Trish Jenner any quality budget but like I said the only one really getting punished for the director's actions, is the fans of this franchise. But I think most people will agree after seeing the newest sequel that this movie wasn't that bad. And I will say one more time if you give this movie a few more million dollars to clean up the graphics and you change the ending a little bit you have a much better film. But even as it is it's much better than a 3.9.",

I like the lore and the creature, and there is potential here, but this one missed the mark. Still, a few fun ideas make it watchable, but its obviously very cheap as much action happens off screen.",

JC Reborn lacks all the things that made the first two movies great. Even the Creeper is poorly acted. The cast is not much better. The story had a chance by starting out prequel but, after leaving the past it loses its potential before segueing into the present. And how is it that the first two Jeepers Creepers (2001 & 2003) has much better CGI twenty years ago?! Too bad the Director didn't have the skill, motivation or money to make a movie that wouldn't be only memorable for just how bad it is.",

The film was a complete homage to the first two Creepers films. Mostly, the first one. It was way darker and had more kills than ever.. We even almost got close to finding out the Creepers true origins that could be the secret to killing him ( Hopefully, Not). All of the characters had a connection to the Creeper that made it more interesting then the first one.The acting in the film was decent. The film moved very fast and was an excitement. And Gina Phillips cameo makes you really want to see Jeepers Creepers 4. Just hopefully they bring Meg Foster back for Part 4 because she made the film for me, she was a riot and those eyes are amazing! As a filmmaker of horror myself I condemn the history of Salva. And have seen every film he has made and think he has more of a vision then these crappy so-called filmmakers now. At lease it wasn't a complete remake more like a Prequel/Sequel. I hope they make the fourth film and keep it going until Part 12. If Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th can have a hundred sequels and remakes they should do it for the Jeepers Creepers franchise. Great Film.",

            "content": "Oh my, what a waste for a movie and the creeper. And you can't blame the creeper himself. The creeper was necessary and worthy enough to be a horror icon, now that the former icons such as Freddy, Jason, Michael Voorhees and others are getting old or remade.Jeepers Creepers, especially in part 1 and 2, gave the audience the feeling that we were being hunted by the creature. Not just as living and running prey, but because he can smell our fear, the fear he installed himself. And a creature that can be slowed but never stopped, is a horror itself.The claustrofobia of part 1, was beautifully created because they used few actors and few locations, with always little distance between the 'heroes' and the monster. Part 2 recreated that claustrofobia by giving the creeper new enemies, a different bu just as effective setting, and showing more of his strengths and powers, without giving away anything about his history.Part 3 had the difficult job to tell us more about the nature and history of the monster. But it hardly did. What it had to offer was more info about his favorite weapong: the truck. But besides that, all the movie did was kind of repeating his tricks and strengths but never effective, because almost everything was in broad daylight, worsened by terrible effects and acting. To make things worse, it is suggested by some effect, that one person now knows everything about who and what the creeper is. This happens halfway the movie, and it is hinted at again at the end. And than the movie ends!!!!!! Nothing is told about the creeper, nothing at all. In this way the movie insults the viewer and forces you to hope for another sequel. And curiosity is the only reason to hope for that sequel, because the story, the acting and the effects killed anything that was nice and scary about the franchise that seems to have been killed by this worthless 3rd installment.",

            "content": "The worse thing about this film is the hair plugs. You're not fooling anyone man. The movie obviously got cut on their budget when it comes to effects. The writing isn't fantastic but I've seen way worse before. The acting for the most part was okay. The only acting that really suffered is brought upon because of the bad writing/directing. You can tell some actors bit their tongues when they had to hold back how people would really act in situations.\nI hate how many times they have actors look up. If you hear a ding on the top of a truck, you look up, like the first film. But if you see something pop up in the air and you're in a truck, there's not much you'll find staring up at your ceiling; you would pop your head out and look up at the sky. But again, bad directing. \nI will say that a third sequel set in the same timeline as the first two films is kind of annoying but the story works and connects in a cool way. \nHonestly I never would have gone to the theater to see this but spending the hour and forty minutes on Netflix is okay. If you watched the first two, honestly it's not a complete waste of time. It adds a little more depth to the truck and the character and some fairly cool shots. I will say that it didn't feel very much like a horror film though. They need better direction to take it back to it's roots. Eventually the story should include a way to kill this creature and where he came from, similar to how Alien built their own universe. \nAll in all, watch it once at least. That's probably all you need.",

To be honest watching this new movie I was expecting to see the return of Trish Jenner but that did not really happen only the last 2 mins of the movie. that was a major let down for me. Let me start by talking about the bad things. This movie had some good parts in it and it did scare me in a few scenes but the movie had a bad Script. The director said this was going to be the most frightening Jeepers Creepers Film well hate to say it but it's not. It's not very creepy it's not very bloody it's not very entertaining it's not one of those movies like Halloween. It's pretty much boring. This movie is definitely not the best Jeepers creepers Film. The first 2 films were great this movie is such a major major let down . It was a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money seeing it. I think I should get a refund for this trash.. there's not much i like about this movie. I'm not gonna say this is the worst movie in the world because isn't...The good things I like about this movie ...The creeper had more kills and he had more scenes plus his truck was kind of magical but very fakeish. That's about it. Again I'm not gonna lie I was really expecting a better film a better script' better actors plus bring back original actors that did not have a 2_3 min role in the film. I was expecting too see the creepers origins but that did not really happen hopefully Jeepers creepers 4 will be better and hopefully we don't have to wait another 14 years too get another film. Overall again a major let down very very disappointed not worth the 14 year Wait the movie did scare me a few times but nothing really exciting' not worth my time to watch it again. I only gave this movie 3 stars out of 10......",

            "content": "So, Victor Salva returned after a pretty long time, well he did a few more horror films before, but in a very long time, he didn't manage to make a worthy film. He mostly dedicated himself to horror films, and I don't know what his intent is, but his horror films are cheap and uninteresting. I know that it's not the subject here, maybe Salva can't get a decent budget, or access to some big studio because of his conviction of sexual molestation of a minor during 90s. OK, that's not the point here. So let's dive in.Salva gives us a story, who knows where or, when, probably in the 80s. This time, more people are aware of the Creeper and they have a special police task force for hunting him. The other sub plot is a farm where an old woman and her granddaughter are having a hard time living financially, but the focal point is that the old woman (played by Meg Foster), has something on her farm that is of crucial importance. Salva stated in the interview that this will be the SCARIEST of all \"Creepers\" films... Well, he lied.And, let's talk about it. The story is dull, script is generic, the movie has dumb, non-interesting and clich\u00e9 characters. To mention that the film itself has some very, old clich\u00e9 formulas. For example, the phone without contact bars and car that won't start. Really? If you have these elements in your horror film in 2017, that means that you are either stupid, or lazy. Now, the characters... Before I start to talk about actors, I would like to point out that there are characters in the film that basically burst out of nowhere, and try to act all important in their scenes. It's just obnoxious and doesn't serve us anything interesting, nor intriguing. First of all, Stan Shaw and Meg Foster. Two biggest names here, both were well known names during 70s and 80s. And they were casted because of their names. But, the problem is, they are pretty much forgotten. Only a keen moviegoer would recognize them. Others and new generations... Not that much. Still, they were the best actors in the film. Stan was interesting, but his character was one dimensional. Meg's character also was one dimensional and... She didn't age well. I bet they didn't use any make up on her. And I think that she was casted because of her old looks and her trademark blue, piercing eyes, just to look more weirder to the audience. But, all that was also wasted. Other actors didn't do much. They were dull meat sacks in a typical horror film. Johnathan Breck returns as Creeper. But, they also gave him a little to work with here. Breck was interesting in the first two films, but here, nothing new. He had much more personality before. The Creeper design is basically the same, this time with a red long sleeve shirt. Why? I think they wanted him to look like Freddy Krueger. Just look at him. At first glance, he does look like Freddy. That's a pathetic move. Anything to make your character appealing to audience. How stupid they think we are? Also, I think that they decided to give more screen time to the famous \"Beatngu\" truck. And here the truck, basically is rigged with unexplained, silly traps. So silly, in fact, that the creeper fell for one of them. Aw, Jesus...On occasions, but only few times, the film keeps you invested. Just for a short time. And some action scenes are tolerable and fun to watch. Don't expect more than that. In conclusion, this is one, dull movie that offers nothing new and nothing exciting in the horror genre. The important thing is that the rabbit is free! The people who watched this film will understand this last remark.",

So the next question is, do you have to see the first to get what's going on, and the answer is, eh, not really. So we catch the Creeper in his few remaining days of his cycle, which is every 23 years in Spring for 23 days he wakes and feeds, I'm not sure if all his victims float down here, but who knows. The local sheriff has recruited this squad of \"creature hunters\" who have been hunting the Creeper for generations... Meanwhile across town we meet crazy grandma, talking to the ghost of her dead son, who fell victim to you know who... no, not Voldemort. Her son happens to have a piece of the Creeper, that drove him insane...but the heart of this horror story is the true love between two shy teens who will surely end up together, oooh he does get on that bus tho... you'll see.

However dosent manage to capture the feel of the first two and dose take a slight dip in quality.The Creeper as always is very cool in this movie and the design and performance is still Awesome. However in this movie he doesn't do a whole alot of killing they leave that for the car which makes a return in this one and makes no Sense suddenly it's got all these abilities and projectiles that come.out kill people and it looks really stupid.They also try to bring a new idea into this one that parts of the Creeper that he loses reveals all the secretes of the creature and how to kill it. Now this is an interesting idea for the franchise and I do like It however we never find out anything new about the Creeper and its really annoying where 3 movies now and we have nothing and they introduce this new idea and we still know nothing and the people who do find out something they end up dying.Some of the CGI dose also need a bit of work in this one mainly some of the projectiles from.the cars and certain moments with the Creeper. There are also some cheesy acting moments mainly from the people hunting down the Creeper.Other than that though this movie is still alot of fun and definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of this Franchise and the Creeper is always fun to watch and still remains a bad ass in this film In my opinion.\nI also like some of the new story elements like the body parts revealing secrets it's a very interesting idea.Also the ending really sets up for sequel with Trish coming back I really hope this happens because I enjoy this Franchise alot and it's a very cool cliffhanger in my opinion.Verdict 7.5/10 good prequel/sequel definitely has some flaws in the story telling and some CGI looks dodgy but a very fun sequel but the weakest in the franchise so far.",

The gore is nothing special and some of the CGI looks more like 1997 quality rather than 2017 (with some supremely daft rolling mines that bring to mind the Langoliers, except they are less visually impressive). Also, the Creeper's van, in addition to its techo-marvels, also seems to be a TARDIS, as it is rather compact from the outside, but huge on the inside where we see unfortunate inmates attempting to escape its confines. None of the characters really stand out except for Meg Foster, who brings gravitas to the proceedings, but the film is not worthy of her efforts.

Near the end the character Buddy leaves on the same school bus from Part 2. Don't bother checking - He wasn't in JC2. There really wasn't any point in connecting the two movies, because we already knew they were connected.They introduce new characters that (evidently) had a connection to the Creeper the 23 years before Trish & Darry arrived. I didn't see any point in this. They didn't add anything to the mythology other than state \"We know what the Creeper is\" - but they don't bother telling the audience. All we really discover is that the Creeper has crows following him around.A lot of attention was focused on the \"BEATNGU\" truck, providing a closeup of something that (sure) is pretty cool, but specifically I knew they did this for time & budget restraints. The truck has sentience and can drive itself. It's also impervious to bullets ... even the tires & windows.",

This character has so much potention, but these releases just put a bad taste in my mouth over this movie....Part 4: Soon to come which is going to have part 1's the girl who didn't die. She may be the one to kill this thing, but HOW? I honestly am going to have to tie myself to a chair & tape my eyes open to watch part 4.. I really tainted my eyes watching Part 2 & 3!",

So I wasn't deterred by the bad \"buzz\" over this movie.After all, the first movie was one of the tensest, scariest movies I'd ever watched, and the mounting tension as more and more about the Creeper is revealed was scary fun. The performances were also note-perfect.But by contrast this movie, from the start, felt tired and empty and thrown-together. Good camera-work and music were wasted on a plot and acting that were very sub-par. All the LEOs seemed like lost idiots, not professionals; the writing was lazy and overbroad, the performances were repeatedly cartoonish and off-putting.The script really does feel like very little thought was put into it, and no feedback sought nor accepted. I mean, seriously - a country boy tinkers together a high-caliber gattling gun, and NEVER ONCE tries it out? NEVER ONCE shreds a target, or a tree, or a cow?Then finally comes the big reveal, as the Creeper finds a sign saying \"We know what you are.\" He raises his head to the heavens and screams......and absolutely nothing comes of it.I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't. Disappointingly disappointing.Oh, if there's a four, particularly with Gina Phillips back, I'll watch it. But the movies so far are ordered correctly: 1 is the best, 2 is less so, and 3 a very, very distant third.",

            "content": "There were literal days in between the events of the first and the second of these movies, but of course, no movie gets made that quickly, and there was a year between them. Time itself has a part to play in these movies, and because of that 23 year detail, it wasn't unreasonable for the highly anticipated third movie to be released later, or a lot later. But here it finally is, and there are two major problems. Number one is the plot. It isn't a continuation of what the first two movies told us, no, instead, it is a chunk of screen-time right in between them. One of the old actors is back, and he looks older now, but the character isn't supposed to look older, because \"Jeepers Creepers 3\", strange and unnecessary as it may rightfully appear, happens right after \"Jeepers Creepers\", and there is very little time between the events of these two movies, but one was made 16 years after the other. Obviously, it isn't a positive thing to say. Common sense takes some serious hits in this one.Other than that, there is the budget. The creator of the franchise, Victor Salva, has a seriously damaged reputation, which may be the reason for that problem. Anyway, the visuals took a serious hit as well. The locations and the camerawork were good. Looking at this material is comfortable for the eyes, it is good work, no doubt, but the problems begin where computer generated imagery has to come into play. It does not look good. Both the content and the shape easily lose to the first two movies.As for the positives, the actors were good, the music was decent, not as impactful as before, but solid. Jonathan Breck as the monster shines, and the creature effects, when done practically, were good. The story itself does have drama and mystery, no, it isn't a waste of time. It does not fit in perfectly with the big picture and will raise questions, but it is worth a shot. There is something else that needs to be brought up as a positive, and it is interesting. It goes for the franchise in general and isn't ignored in the third film, but there is reason to suspect it will be gone when a whole other team of creators take over and more movies are released. Other than no longer casting Breck as the creature, what the franchise might soon lose is the lack of sexual activity, even though the monster mainly preys on young people. This was special about the franchise, and something tells me it will be gone. Not that it will be a problem, but I wouldn't like \"Jeepers Creepers\" to go down the same path \"Wrong Turn\" did as early as in the second movie. Namely, two cheap moves, excessive violence and sex.",

Kudos to authors for finding an actor who played a role of the police officer in Part I and making him looking pretty much like he was in the original. His new partner is played by Stan Shaw, who overacts all the time. The famous \"BeatingU\" truck is also back, this time it's a thing in itself and has many traps.The budget is not on the same level as it was before though. The makeup is still good, but the visual effects are not. It's all CGI and most of the time it looks very cheap, some of the moments look like a student After Effects project, which is a serious downgrade comparing to both of the previous movies.It's also back to being focused on the police action against the creature, like it was in the second part of the first movie (they now even have a car with a minigun).The authors promised that they will tell more about the Jeepers, they...ehm, did, yeah. The characters supposedly learn about who the Creepers is through the Thing-like living hand which was previously a part of it, but they never tell that they learned to the viewer. There's also a very damaging scene for the canon, where Creepers just throws away a whole car to find a man under it. The creature was always very strong, but not like THAT, not like some kind of Superman. Making him stronger like that just puts endless plot holes all over the whole trilogy, including this part.",

As well as this they destroy the hand in which shows them the Jeepers Creepers past making noone else able to see about him and really questions if the audience will ever know more about his past.

A shame beacuss of the potential this movie had.CL",

AGAIN in that SAME scene, as the creeper was like indecisive about wether to use his left hand or his right hand to kill the girl, she just falls onto the ground and like, sits there for a bit whilst her killer is about to shoot her in the head with some ancient druid spear thing.6. also i wont forget about the part where that guy accidentally runs over the creeper with his truck, as he calls the police he just has this stupid \"shocked face\" on him like :0, and EVEN if the cops did pick up to his call, what is he going to say, ''hey i just ran over Thanos and satan's child\" LIKE WHAT.7. which leads me to my other question, who thought it was a good idea to make the MAIN VILLAIN look like a total loser. like, your trying to make a horror antagonist not the new \"avengers infinity war villain, ps2 edition\"i was so disappointed in this movie i cant even think of a way to put it into words. utter disgust is all i feel when watching this disgrace of a movie.",

But I honestly did not expect a Sharknado level of horrendous cinema that this installment delivered.\nThis was never scary, never good, never mysterious, never funny, never anything the first two were. They tease and apparently is true that there's a fourth movie in the making. Which I'm torn about. Like, yeah I'll watch it (I'm not above it) because it honestly can't get any worse than this one was. Talk about a tremendous disappointment. Right now I'm struggling to even make jokes, that's how hurt I am by this installment. I'm TRIGGERED BY THIS MOVIE. That's a thing today that kids say, right? I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HOW BAD THIS FILM IS AND IT MAKES ME ANXIOUS AND DEPRESSED AND I NEED COUNSELING.\nThe plot was a tease, basically we were supposed to learn something about the Creeper's backstory. What we learned is it's ancient and there is a way to defeat it. That's it. Jesus Christ Victor, come on man! Bad acting, bad story, no scares, horrendous effects, just all around a huge dud. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 20 percent, but not even enough for a critical consensus and IMDb actually gave it a 4! I didn't know IMDb went that low! What a milestone! What heights we have reached! And by heights I mean low, low lows! The film has grossed almost two-and-a-half million and Box Office Mojo doesn't have the balls to tell us how much it took to make because it couldn't have been more than ten dollars and a Subway footlong.\nYou wanna know how difficult it is to write anything about this movie? I couldn't tell if the actor names were the character names and vice versa. Yeah. Mhmm. I cannot, I just can't with this movie. Victor Salva should spend less time getting arrested for Child Porn and more time crafting a story. Too soon? Also, anyone notice how his most famous film series involves the name Creeper when that's what he is? No? No one? Okay just me. Child porn joke, check. Even worse hack joke, check. Subpar movie review, check. Okay! I think I'm all set here. Cheers folks!",

Not to mention the bone spike rope that shoots out the back and can catch up with motorbikes.Acting terrible, effects are terrible they have a 20mm gatling gun that hardly does any damage, I thought there was going to be some pretty decent effects when they fired up that bad boy but they might as well have used a nerf gun.Nobody wanted a movie set at this point we've all been waiting for a movie progressing from the end of part 2 with the thing strung up in the barn and set 23 years in the future.Which brings to the point at the end you see the girl from the original JC spouting vengeance for her brother Justin, Long since dead but given the time frame of this film she looks visibly older but obviously a cheap shot at getting us hooked for JC4 and if this is a teaser then the movie is going to be set again in this same feeding period.\nI just don't get it unless they actually set it 23 years after JC2 then she'll be well older, after this fiasco I'm not assed about JC4 and don't understand why in this day and age anyone would want to work with this kiddie fiddler Director but then again people still work with Woody Allen",

He now roars and is able to lift up cars, way to go bat man creature. That car harpoon can go really far and fast to catch someone on a motocross, that was when i stopped believing this movie was serious. The effects were total crap, hello green screens ! I have no idea what happened at the \" We know what you are moment\" close to the end, other than his 23 days were up. \nIt ends with Trish Jenner wanting revenge for her brother ( who died in the first movie ) in another 23 years.. it could have been a good idea except technically this movie is based 46 years after his death and she should be atleast 60 years old, not 30 which is what she looks like. She would have to wait another 23 years. We're looking at 69 years after the death of her brother, she should be approx 90 years old in the next one. Sooooo disappointed",

Now, I have seen some of the presentation and CGI complaints about the movie, but it looks like it has been cleaned up a lot for the Netflix release of it.It was nice to see The Creeper again, I just wished it would've been with a different concept than one we've already seen twice already.",

The timeline needs to be after part 2 as that's how it should signify its title no. This movie has some good thrills which were not there in previous parts. The only problem with this part is the Captain obvious quote... Beating you or Be Eating you....Also the problem with the creeper and the truck that they were super resistant. In previous installments, there were some scenes where the creeper gets weaker for some time like in part 1 when it is run over by the car, Part 2 when he fell from sky on bus roof. Here in this part, the cops shoot at the truck and the bullets bounce back eventually. Also, the truck was mechanically excellent with spear and the back side with impaling nails. These things were unnecessary. It could have been better if such things were not there. Also, when the cop shot him with giant gun, the creeper didn't even feel the bullets. He was walking with his own Swag. This could have been better ifThe bullets were able to puncture the truck and creeper to be a bit hurt. From there they could carry away a new scene The creeper should have felt bullets at least for 15-30 seconds.Beting U shouldn't be that advanced.The son of old lady shouldn't have been appearing very often like it was in An American Werewolf in London.Rest is good, I really enjoyed the movie.Waiting for 4th installment.

That would have been the Sheriff dept, local county seat dept, amd probably neighboring county depts (again none would be wearing the same exact uniform color). Obviously they didn't ask or pay local LEO's for literally 5 minutes of time.The son who bearied the hand, when he shoots it before burying it, he uses a repeater rifle and never cycles the repeater to load the next round, he shot it three times.The vulcan cannon is way too obvious in its welds that it doesnt mechanically cycle correctly when engaged. Also obviously mild steel construction, which really lends to it being a major fake. The barrels never rotate when used in the movie.Every time the creature stabbed someone, they used a sound effect of two swords clashing..The CB radio used by the hunting team requires a whip antenna on that truck. No antenna.Sherriff Sergeant/Major uses a mini 14 to try and pop rubber tires and the rounds bounce off.....really.Sheriff Sergeant/Major uses a novice grip, but weaver stance is appropriate for his age.Couldnt watch with any seriousness due to all these major flaws.",

If you want just senseless killing, and not really any kind of story this is a good one time watch. If you're looking for the next great horror flick, don't waste your time.

            "content": "Jeepers Creepers works. It drags on too long and has way too many moments where the characters stand around and do nothing when they should be running, but it has some good atmosphere, introduces the creature well enough, and builds to an ending where the creature gets what it wants and flies away.Jeepers Creepers 2 also works. The title doesn't really make sense anymore because that only had solid meaning in the first film, but it's a logical continuation of the story. Everything to do with Ray Wise's character is fun and the film leads up to the end of the creature's 23-day feeding period. We actually see how it goes dormant and get a little more insight into how the creature works. I have gripes with the character development and the corny moment where he eats a guy's head, but overall, it's an entertaining movie with better pacing than the first one. It's not as good as the first, but it's more fun, so I feel like the first two movies are about even but I enjoy the second one more.Then comes Jeepers Creepers 3. The first film feels like an introduction, the second feels like a conclusion, then this one feels like... wasting time for no reason in between part 1 and 2. It takes place in the few days between the first two movies and doesn't really bring anything new to the table, even though it repeatedly feels like it's trying to. (More on that later.)The creature uses its ax and truck again, which were missing from the second movie. It was nice to see those again. It was also cool that the truck was developed more... but some of the revelations about the truck were corny. I especially hated the little car-seeking bombs that rolled out of it.There was also a lot going on in the daylight. The first two movies had more action at night, which was more moody, but this could have been a budgetary issue.Most of the effects and cinematography were fine. For the budget, I thought it was a pretty good looking movie. I had really low expectations and was surprised at how decent it looked. There were a few shitty effects shots though. There were only three brief effects that particularly bugged me, but they hurt the movie quite a bit.My biggest issue is that the whole movie ended up feeling completely pointless. Having it set in between the first two movies meant that it couldn't show the end of it's 23-day feed and it couldn't be killed. There wasn't even really a major finale. It basically just ends without any reason. The creature just vanishes and the characters say \"I heard it's gone now. Won't be back for 23 springs.\" \"Oh, that's good.\" WHY? Why would it be gone? Why would they have reason to think it's gone?As for the movie's major \"reveals/twists\":SPOILERS1. One of the main characters from this movie ended up on the bus from the second movie. Okay? Well he obviously wasn't IN the second movie. That wouldn't make sense if he was. All of the athletes on the bus in the second film had no idea what the creature was or what was going on. If he was on that bus, you'd think he would have spoken up. So he must have gotten off and stayed at their destination. (Apparently he mutters some throwaway dialogue that confirms this, but I missed it.) Then what are the implications of showing that he was on that bus? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! It's just \"Hey, remember that bus from the other movie? Well, this character was on that bus one time.\" SO FUCKING WHAT??? Does this mean he lead to creeper toward the bus or something? This reveal just doesn't appear to add anything to the story or change it in any way. It feels totally pointless and stupid. It comes off like a big revelation, but it's more like an Easter egg that was splattered in your face as opposed to hidden. MAYBE his involvement with the team could serve some purpose in part 4, but I struggle to imagine what such a purpose could be.2. The creature's hand got cut off in 1978 and if you touch it, you learn what the creature is. Ooooh, enticing. So what is it? What do they learn? They learn that \"it's an ancient thing.\" Oh. Okay? We already knew that from previous movies? So are there any other implications here? Do they learn how to kill it or something? If so, they don't really say it. They just \"learn what it is\" and then they leave a sign for it saying \"We know what you are.\" So fucking what? What are the grand implications of them knowing what it is? They never give any new information to the audience and their knowledge doesn't seem to have any bearing on the story. But still, the creeper seems very upset by this sign and falls to its knees and roars as all of the crows die around it. (That scene was actually pretty cool, but I still don't get how it affected the story in any way at all.) This seems to be the only thing that provoked the creature to fly away at the end of the movie. It's clearly scared that they can hurt it with the information they got, I guess. So this \"big revelation\" is something that won't be revealed until the next movie if it even happens. This tiny little concept is the only part of this movie that hinted at serving a purpose, and I feel like they could have just introduced it and followed through on it in the same movie instead of just trying to drag the series out longer.3. In a tacked-on ending scene that wasn't built up to in any way, we suddenly see Trish from the first film. She's putting out a call to arms and announcing that when the creature comes back in 2024, she's going to kill it once and for all. WELL THERE'S YOUR FUCKING STORY! Why didn't you tell THAT story for part 3? The final ending to the creature would actually carry some weight and affect the damn story. But no, instead, you just chose to waste our fucking time meandering in between part 1 and 2. Thanks.END SPOILERSOverall, the movie was underwhelming and it filled a gap that nobody asked to be filled. It did so without bringing any worthwhile information to the table or doing anything significant for the story of the series. This would all be fine for a slasher film if it were at least entertainingly gruesome, but it doesn't really hit the spot there either.The way Salva wrote this one just seems to be a big set up for the next one. He should have just blown his load and finished the series with this third movie, because the whole film industry is trying to distance themselves from him for his pedophilia and I'll be surprised if he manages to get part 4 off the ground. I've been interested enough in the series to watch them all, but I don't feel the need to own them. I'll give part 4 a rent if it happens.And to ease my conscience over giving money to Victor Salva, I made a donation to his victim, who is trying to fund a tour to raise awareness of sexual abuse and help other victims. I recommend that the high & mighty keyboard warriors who condemn Jeepers Creepers fans shut up and do the same: https://www.gofundme.com/we-r-their-voiceJeepers Creepers - 5/10\nJeepers Creepers 2 - 6/10\nJeepers Creepers 3 - 4/10",

Although i still watched the movie hoping that maybe it will get better which never happened. It just got bad and bad and bad. There's nothing good about the movie and i literally mean nothing. First there's no plot, they even managed to mess up a straightforward story line. Second, the events happening in the movie made no sense whatsoever. It simply looked like they were trying to combine various random events. Third, the acting of the characters is very bad. Given what was happening in the movie, it had some of the most bullshit dialogues and expressions i have ever seen. Fourth, the representation of the creature in this movie is the worst in the series. Since, when did it needs all those weapons, it's like all of a sudden it has become modern. Simply took away the originality of the creature. The least they could have done is to give us some closure about the origins of the creature but again that never happens.So my advise to you is to just stay away from this.

Stan Shaw's character chewed so much scenery that the rest of the actors had no solid ground to stand on, not that it matters since they were apparently given no direction and just stood around looking confused. Meg Foster was about the only decent thing in the movie and that's disappointing since the Creeper is the namesake. This go around he was a complete joke. He wasn't menacing or scary like he was in the first two films. Salva and co completely neutered his character in favor of giving more attention to his truck which is somehow an indestructable tank including tires that can't be pierced by bullets. Go figure. I was really looking forward to seeing Trish again and how they would include her but alas she only gets a small cameo before the credits roll.

Sheriff Tashtego and Gaylon Brandon both touched the hand of the Creeper that had been cut off in the past. Supposedly that showed them what the Creeper was, how it was created, and possibly how someone could kill it. The movie never told us how it was created, which probably would have been a better premise for a movie that this wast of time, never said what it was, and never said how it could be possibly killed. Sheriff Tashtego ends up shooting the Creeper with a gatling gun that they planned to use since the beginning of the movie. That doesn't kill the Creeper which leads to the question why did he touch the hand if he was going to try and shoot the Creeper anyway. The movie never mentions how long the Creeper has been loose just that it gets turned loose for 23 days. Through most of the movie there is a big focus on the Creeper needing to go the farm to get his hand and kill anyone there. When he finally does make it back to the farm, there is a note on the ground stating \"We know what your are\" with the hand on top of the not with a nail through it. The Creeper yells and then the movie just ends. \"We know what you are\", but were not going to tell anyone else apparently. The special effects were nothing to brag about, the acting was mediocre, and the movie for the most part was boring. If anyone watches cinema sins, and they do this movie, it would be worth watching cause it will be thoroughly torn apart. As it should be. Maybe they should make the next installment in like 3 years, cause 14 seemed give the writers to much time to think about what they wanted in the movie so they just put a little pieces of a ton of ideas and decided not to complete any of them.",

The effects are worse than ever, everything just looks cheap and the story is god awful. They don't even follow their own rules or established timeline.I won't spoil anything but there is supposed to be this reveal and...it's just beyond stupid and completely pointless. It actually detracts from the movie despite giving no new information about the character.Just don't watch it. Trust me...it's not so bad it's good, it's not anything but bad and if you are a fan of the series you will be dumbfounded by how utterly horrible this movie is.

The acting is equally terrible.The movie isn't cohesive whatsoever, it's an absolute mess. The whole movie I never really had an idea who the characters were and absolutely didn't care. It's pretty bad if you only care about the horse. In hindsight the movie doesn't even really seem to be about the creeper as he has almost no screen time. The main character in this movie is his truck as it was painfully obvious they had no budget for special effects so they had to keep the creeper on the ground. When special effects were used it looked like it was done with Windows movie maker or something.We were promised a backstory, but were given some high school parody project about a hobo driving around in an old truck.

Jeepers Creepers shouldn't be funny or gimmicky, the first film was creepy. It was a chase movie, if the creeper wanted you then you were already dead.

The scene when he's hanging out the car window trying to shoot out the tyres of the Creeper's van - not only are his hands shaking like he's got the DTs but he is holding the gun in a very dubious manner.The Creeper's shuriken hits Tubb's shotgun square on the barrel, bending the metal like a peeled banana. I have only seen such things before in cartoons. I was literally shaking with laughter for about ten minutes.The moment when Tubbs attempts to \"run away\", although one can only use the term \"run\" in the very loosest of fashions. I'll admit it, I nearly soiled myself I was laughing so much.Creeper wardrobe malfunction - or should I say wing malfunction. OMG, one of the funniest things I have ever seen in a movie.The moment when the Creeper loses an eye. When he then attempts to sight the spear at the girl running away and realizes he has to sight on the other side because of the missing eye is where things descended into the deepest farce. That was SO funny I was barely able to breathe.When the girl realizes the Creeper's spear just grazed her and she is feeling around on top of her head for the missing hair. Just priceless.Why are Tubbs and Tashtego always shouting at eachother? I suspect it was a desperate attempt to inject some much needed drama into the proceedings.The Creeper's severed hand in a flowerpot. The B movie moments just keep on coming.I could go on, and on, and on...On the acting front it was a disaster.Gabrielle Haugh was a waste of oxygen - I mean, there was just...nothing.Meg Foster was the scariest thing in the movie.On the plus side. I think Stan Shaw and Brandon Smith did their best with their script. Was this movie one big spoof?",

Victor Salva, the director of this creation, delayed the third part for a very long time, they say that due to personal circumstances. The third part takes place between the first and the second, which is a little strange.The plot is that the winged monster returns every 23rd spring, dissecting on his rusty truck and terrifying all living things. It is in this part of Jeepers Creepers that they will show in all its glory, it will appear before the audience in daylight, a grin, a look, gestures, all this can be considered. The truck has also undergone changes, in general, you will see everything for yourself.In the center of the plot is a young girl Eddie, who lives on a farm with her grandmother, the woman suffers from mental disorders, her main goal is to save her granddaughter and take revenge on the clawed monster.A group of people are trying to confront Jeepers Creepers, how will the battle end?The third part does not reach the first and second parts, I still wanted more horror, but in general I liked the film, and perhaps those who were in the subject and followed the story will like it. I was very pleased with the acting. There are practically no moments when they do not play out or overplay. Everything will be here, intrigue, confusing meaning, a logical plot and a very unexpected ending. My rating is 10 stars. It is up to you to decide whether or not to go to the cinema, the film can already be found on the Internet. I recommend Jeepers Creepers Part 3 to watch.",

The unnecessary romance subplot and the inclusion of plots that go nowhere, such as the random hand, contributed to the film's lack of coherence and focus. Additionally, the film's special effects were not up to par, which detracted from the overall viewing experience. I felt like the story did too much to try and rewrite the rules that had already been established. We know the Creeper won't die since it's before the second movie, so the only investment was the plot about how the hand gives the characters special knowledge. However, the only thing we learn is that it's \"ancient.\" But many could have inferred that already. Therefore, it's a useless plot line. Given these issues, it's better to watch any other movie instead of wasting time on Jeepers Creepers 3.",

After 14 years since the last movie, witch a lot of people thought was s$%t, I kind of liked it, it was far from good and far from the first one but still very enjoyable. But oh my god does this one crap all over it. What surprises me is that it's the original director who promised us a backstory and a final explanation for the Creeper. Yeah you won't get it. You'll be teased till the end and nothing will be explained. You'll get a cameo at the end and a pretty cheesy one and really cringe worthy. My god and the visuals the damn CGI, it looked far better in 2001. Just look at the gap 2001-2017. Imagine that let it sink in. And they ruined the main antagonist by giving him a new stylish red shirt...what? I can get past that if he was frightening here or at least intimidating, but I didn't flinch. Use of pointless CGI, where you can use practical effects is just laughable. I mean if it was good CGI i can get over it but this looks like TV series quality. Some TV shows have much better visual effects...actually a lot of them. The acting...just...some is good but...just I can't even. And get the best part...the story takes place between the first two movies. Am not joking. What a twist -_-... Some shots are just plain good, nothing more, just average and music is also that average but with everything else and the lies about what we were gonna get it can't go higher then 1/10. It doesn't deserve a higher score, just a shame.",

After watching the new JC: Reborn last night in cinemas and rewatching JC3 right now, it does not deserve a low rating that it has received. This film does deliver; good story, acting and ties together 1&2 well whilst setting up the next film quite well.

I even went to see the first one in theaters-definitely telling my age*sighs* but what I loved about it was how it was an original horror story and you were actually genuinely scared crazy. What it did to me was make me imagine what if I was in that town or on that school bus what would I do?With that said Jeepers Creeper 3 took all that feeling away. I will start with the positives first. I loved the scenic views and how bright and colorful the film was-different from the first two which were dark. The motorcycle scene was great! Meg Foster was a scene stealer with those eyes in some scenes-get to that later.That BEATNGU old truck had its own bells and whistles this time around-I like that! Getting to see Gina Phillips was great too possibly leading to 4?Now for the bad. So what's up with the main actress? Did she not want to be there? It looked like she was being forced or something. Not believable at ALL! OMG what happened to the Creeper? He looked like Jason Stathum with a mask on- not creepy like the first 2 but seriously jacked?? The CGI, soooo bad. One part mainly but I won't give that away but was that supposed to be the epic showdown??? Sometimes to me it looked and felt like Meg Foster was acting in another movie, overly dramatic and over acting. Questions in regards to Creepers origin left open, ending sucks- I know it should have led into 2 but a jump scare something at least? Just not what I was expecting after waiting all these years and then just releasing for only 2 days, I expected more. Way more.",

There is a job for army and specops after the whole police department saw him and kept him on the aim not a farmers and local police.No logic in the script at all especially for the people who have not seen the previous movies (15 years have passed).

Jeepers Creepers 2 wasn't as good but still had some scary moments in it. Jeepers Creepers 3 was a disappointment.J.C. - 3 was severely lacking any true scary moments, with the acting in some cases being sub-par. The police Sgt. Davis Tubbs had some of the worse lines in the entire movie. Not sure if it was due too bad writing, bad directing, bad acting, or all three. When the police Sgt. did speak, he screamed most of his lines.The other blaring thing on this character was his hair. In real life, Brandon Smith who played police Sgt. Tubbs has very little hair, but someone decided his character needed a military style tall crew cut that screamed DYED TOUPEE. Sadly, every time he was on screen, all I could see was the toupee.The other thing that shocked me was how actress Meg Foster who played Gaylen Brandon looked in the movie. Meg Foster has been acting since the early 60's and with her amazing blue eyes, she was a stunningly beautiful actress. Unfortunately, time has not been kind to her. Like many actors, Meg Foster was a heavy, long-term smoker, destroying her looks. The way Meg Foster looked in this movie, compared too how I remember her looking when she was younger, was very distracting. There was only some color makeup around her eyes, the rest of her appearance was due to years of smoking. Very sad.As in the first two Jeepers Creeper movies, they tried to kill the creature and J.C. - 3 was no different. There was a scene in the movie where they placed a large rotary type Gatling gun in the back of a pick-up truck that one of the actors called a 20mm canon as he loaded 50 cal. ammo in it which is only 13mm. ANYONE with even the slightest knowledge of weapons would know that was the wrong ammo. Even with no knowledge of weapons, you could see the size difference between the ammo and the barrels on the weapon, plus when fired, the barrels didn't rotate like a rotary Gatling type gun would do. Sometimes the little things can make or break a movie.Overall, I was very disappointed in J.C. - 3",

The CGI that looked to be made by someone editing it with their feet. The 500 different stories to follow for each character even though all of them are pure man Tits. That one slow motion scene that you'd swear lasted for 45 minutes.This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life. Considering the first two movies was fantastic horror, and the 14 year gap .... that is between 1 and 2, rather than a sequel from the end of 2, when the man who knew how to kill it became old and waited looking at its corpse awaiting for it to again rise (which he said should be any day now) you'd of expected with all those years of making the movie it would be a big bang ending to the series. In the movie there is a good few stories and none are at all interesting to give a shit. One old woman gets flashbacks and stuff from her dead son that was killed by the creeper, there is biker teens and one is your typical clich\u00e9 asshole but that leads to nothing, one is a nerdy dude that fancies the ... main character? Girl, but it leads to nothing. One was from the first movie and you don't give a bollocks about him because he's ... not a good actor and a boring character. One scene even randonly killed off a ... main actor I suppose you could call it, out of nowhere in a scene that didn't even involve the damn creeper. It was like a comedy sketch. The girl owns a horse and her mum wants to sell it because they've hardly any money but she loves it and that's about that. The money issues story is over before it started, it meant piss all.We still don't know where this creature came from or why he does what he does or what the hand in the film means (yeah some random hand that does something to people that was never explained and didn't really do much to them anyway) holy fuck what the hell is this film about. I genuinely thought I lost some brain cells because I found myself staring at the TV like I was being brain washed by the season of the witch. Funny ending is that the second ended in the old man waiting for it to rise again which would take a few days. Yet the third flm, which takes place before the second film has the girl from the FIRST film telling he creeper to come get her, yet she isn't in the second so it obviously killed her haha my god.

It only just passes the Bechdel test because two of the three female characters talk about not having enough money to buy hay - for a male horse, though... To top it off, there is also a damsel in distress that needs saving. How is it possible to make a movie in 2017 and still use female characters only as props? This is even more emphasised by the outlandish behaviour of all of the male leads. (Plural, since the director could apparently not commit to one.) There were so many scenes where the actors seemed to have forgotten how to \"human\" and act and behave according to what the story required (e.g. a threat of danger should make characters run to their cars like they mean it and express believable urgency or fear; if you have a clear line to take a shot at the villain, you shoot at the villain and don't just soulfully stare into their eyes). I sometimes got the impression the director would have preferred to shoot a comical remake of Platoon instead of JP3. At least then the slow-mo battle action, over-the-top heroism and macho one-liners wouldn't have felt so out of place.And we still don't know more about the Creeper! He got so much screen time but no backstory to speak off and in the end, I was sick of seeing so much off him and would have preferred for him to keep lurking in the shadows instead. More of the Creeper doesn't make for a creepier movie. My heart is weeping for all the wasted potential and the two hours of my life that I just wasted.",

Like the creeper having magic abilities that just automatically make weapons show up in his hands.The beatngu truck, also had stupid magical abilities. The creeper no longer had his personalty nor did any other characters.What really pisses me off is that they dug up his hand and it apparently has magical abilities that lets who ever touched it, know it's secrets and what is and crap. So a bunch of people touch it and all they find out is that it gets to eat every 23 years. WE ALREADY KNEW THAT !!! From the first film even !So we find out nothing about it. The film literally had no ending at all. Acting sucks, no story or plot. Characters sucked. Special effects sucked. Everything sucked. By the 3rd quarter of the film I didn't know if I was supposed to be laughing, like is it a drama/comedy ?Also all the bad words and who knows what else is edited out. Pretty much no night scenes.

Not even from the monster itself.The Creeper who is actually part of my top-10 scary-ass movie monsters was reduced to a mere slasher villain that so happens to have wings and could fly. Pathetic more than scary was the end result.The scenes were also badly cut. There were few instances when dialogues weren't even finished yet then suddenly transitions over to the next scene which seems disconnected from one another.And the main characters were so lame that I was actually rooting for the Creeper to kill them all in the middle of the movie just to get it over and done with.Bottomline: avoid at all cost.",

Having already read the terrible reviews beforehand, I went into this movie with not many expectations whatsoever. The story takes place inbetween the first two Jeepers Creepers movies, which I found to be a strange concept, flawed even. However, saying that there's enough material to keep the viewer entertained. For instance, there's plenty of gore for horror fans and Stan Shaw as the Sheriff makes as an interesting character. A lot of the effects look a bit cheap, it appears like this time around they lacked the budget of the other two movies. The Creeper makeup itself though is still on par with the other movies, and he looks as menacing as ever. Personally, I would have loved a Jeepers Creepers movie with a bit more to the origins of the Creeper, a full story to how he became if you like. That would have been a much better concept.All in all, I don't find it as displeasing like others who have reviewed this title. It's one of the those movies you would watch once on a Saturday night with pizza and a few beers. It's mildly entertaining, doesn't require much thinking, and is easily forgettable. Hard core fans of the original movies will be disappointed though, so watch only if you don't have any huge expectations.",

They were solid in keeping it as original as the first two movies, making it a perfect sequel in the series.

The first Jeepers Creepers, was released in 2001, but the year wasn't disclosed in the movie (to the best of my knowledge). Neither was the year disclosed in the second release either. So the third could, and should had been based around 13 years later, not only because it was released 16 years later, and he's supposed to return every 13 years, for 13 days, but also because Jeepers Creepers \"3\" just adds technology to his \"BEATNGU\" truck, a weak victim who essentially gets away from him ALIVE, which directly contradicts the first movie, which states that, \"when he finds someone that he likes, there's no escaping him. He'll keep coming for you, until he get what he wants (to eat).\nTrue too, in the second movie, nor the \"third\", does he even EAT anything, from anyone! The addition of the technology in the third movie, should had been entitled Jeepers Creepers 1\u00bd, period!\nThe first was the best setting! The second movie, added the \"creepy\" factor, with his smiling at; and taunting his prey! But the third, didn't add anything, but technology to the presetting! The Creepers truck, wasn't even featured in the second movie! And the third, is primarily only about his truck!\nHowever, not in any installment of this movie, is the year disclosed! So making another Jeepers Creepers, needs to be the 13 years later, at least! They can make 2 - 3 movies (apparently), for THAT 13 day period, but it at least needs to pick up, where the second movie left off!\nAnd regardless what people think about Victor Salva, and his past. They can watch the movies, or NOT! This third release, advertises on the covers of both the DVD and Blu-ray releases, that it's the \"THEATRICAL EDITION\". Is there an Extended, Unrated, and/or Uncut edition to this movie?! It only makes sense that there is, being advertised as the \"THEATRICAL EDITION\". So why wasn't the alternative version included on the DVD, or at the very least, the Blu-ray?!\nIf it's in efforts to make people upgrade to \"digital\" only movies, it was a cheap ploy, as MOST people haven't even upgraded to Blu-rays yet!

Most of the movie, I spent on my phone, because I lost interest. The only saving grace to this movie, which doesn't say much, was the scene with the teenagers in the woods. That was a decent scene chock full of suspense and drama. Now take that and turn it into a whole movie. The creeper didn't even eat anybody!

Last year I learned of the director's- Victor Salva- conviction of child molestation. It's not up for debate, he filmed himself molesting his then young actor in one of his films. He served 15 months in prison. FIFTEEN MONTHS. The system failed this young boy- but we can still hit this monster where it really hurts- his pocket. I refuse to watch this movie and it doesn't look like I'm missing much anyway. As much as I love the first one, I'll never ever watch it again.

So the movie begins at the end of the first movie, by the jail that JP takes Darry. But here's the issue. JP2 gives you the impression that JP2 is 23 years later than JP, but in actually all 3 movies occur in the same 23 days. JP makes his first appearance in 1, then JP 3 take place in between, and at the end of JP3 we see the school bus and are told that the end of JP2 is actually the end of the story. But playing off of JP2, the farmer is sitting in the barn as an old man, waiting for the monster to return. This story line doesn't make any sense. And if Tricia is waiting for the monster, are we to see Tricia as an old women in JP4. This movie seriously might have ruined the whole series all together.",

            "content": "First off, I would like to say I was disappointed by this one. Spoiler! Trish is only a cameo. The characters weren't really memorable so I don't remember any of their names. So, this is supposed to take place during the 23 days the creeper had to feed in 1st and 2nd movie. It was complete bs though. SPOILING THE MOVIE! His truck had all these great add-ons you didn't see in the first Jeepers Creepers. He goes after the people on the bus from the 2nd installment, but doesn't hunt down the old lady and her granddaughter after they got away (end of movie)??? Weren't they still in the same house that the creeper had a break down in front of at the end of the film??? Doesn't make any sense. Also, if you are going to link the 3rd movie to the 2nd in the end, it would of made sense to have a guy resembling the character from 3 know who the creeper was in 2. I know this doesn't really make sense, but the movie was poorly done. Also, there are some characters that disappear at some point of the movie. There's a team hunting down the creeper and most of them DISAPPEAR! They aren't even brought up again or anything. The creeper can smell fear, but he couldn't smell that his victims were still alive in his truck? When is the right time to snack on some body parts? Tell me why at one point of the movie after the creeper ate parts from this guy that hit him with a truck, he looked like Deebo from 'Friday'? The creeper was super strong, but the one guy in the 2nd movie was fighting him off when the creeper was on top of him! Come on guys! Consistency is a must. Without it, you get Jeepers Creepers 3. ALSO, what is the creeper? The old lady claimed she knew what the creeper was from locking hands with his severed hand. We didn't get a flashback or anything to explain his origin. That was such a useless part in the movie. If you don't want to explain stuff, just cut it out. The more bs you have, the more it kills a movie. was waiting for this movie for YEARS and now I hope there isn't another one. This movie did the fans dirty.",

            "content": "Those that have seen the rest of the series know that one of the major hooks, is that the \"creeper\" is a rather mysterious character in the horror film genre. In the first two films, all we really know is that every 23rd spring it gets to eat for 23 days, and that it eats to restore it's body.Enter the third film. The allure of this film, is that supposedly after all these years, light will be shed on the creature. There's a part in the film, where they hold the former hand of \"the creeper\", which gives the person a vision of it's past, and what it is. However, NONE of this is shared with the audience! IMHO it's a BIG @#$% you to its patrons. Without a doubt, this is nothing more then a ploy to revive a long dead series due to the lack of creativity in movie producers these days, and string along those enjoyed the franchise milking them of their money.The portrayal of the main antagonist is so far off the mark from the rest of the series. Supposedly, the third film takes place chronologically between the first and second film. Odd part is, that elements of the film are so far outside of scope of the picture the series paints. It treats the character almost like an evil good humor ice cream truck driver.The end of the film alludes to one of the characters being on the bus, the main setting, of the second film. Problem is, that if you link one film to another, the character needs to have some idea of what's going on, in order of sequence. That's just terrible storytelling.I for one will not continue to waste time and energy on subsequent films of this franchise, if such horrendous methods are to be considered part of the new norm.",
