With that in mind I won't exactly be harsh on the movie it had it's good and bad ideas. I think what it suffered from the most is that the Bye Bye Man wasn't exactly scary because you never knew what he'd do once he got you and it's never really explained. He's just like a guy with a dog that rides a train and leaves coins or something. I dunno he's just not a scary enough character.",

Like why did they take a 4 year old to a college house party. Why does the man character constantly say the name that he shouldn't be saying. It felt slapdash.The acting is pretty awful and one of the actors is clearly English doing a horrible American accent. It makes the film slightly entertaining as it enters into like disaster territory but I was just so bored that I struggled to actually focus enough to pick up on things.Also this movie is not scary in the slightest. It has terrible CGI and it's just bad.Don't waste your time with it.",

Years ago it seemed a similar type of film would be hitting the big screen on an almost bimonthly basis, now when we get a horror, it always feels as if something is missing somehow.The Bye Bye Man begins well enough, and has a fairly interesting concept, trouble is the direction is so poor, it fails almost entirely to so the basic premise of a film, and tell a story, it's lazy somehow, we get no backstory, no real conclusion, and certainly no real tension.The acting was fair I guess, but none of the cast were treated well in terms of script.Overall, a total disappointment, some wonderful ideas, just badly realised, and way too predictable, you always seem to know what's coming next. 4/10",

            "content": "There are moments when you watch a trailer for a movie and think to yourself \"Well, the trailer is pretty bad, but maybe the movie is better.\" And, sometimes the movie does actually turn out to be better, making you pleasantly surprised. I did not have that feeling as I watched the trailer for the Bye Bye Man. After the trailer ended, there was not one ounce of me that thought \"OK, maybe I should give it a shot.\". I watched this movie with my best friend, who also happens to be a horror fan, only because we have literally seen everything else that was out. I personally found three major issues with the movie. 1. The characters: Not one of the characters were particularly likable, so who really cares if any or all of them get hacked to bits? They don't really have any back story. The only one you feel any emotion towards at all is Elliot, and even those moments of emotion are sparse. Of course, he's the only one who has somewhat of a history to him. 2. The acting: To put it simply, the acting is horrendous. It's downright laughable. The writing can only be blamed for so long. It felt more like a high school stage production (and a bad one at that), than an actual movie. The women who played Kim, and Elliot's girlfriend, are by far the worst out of the whole movie, the latter being slightly worse than the former.3. The worst thing about this movie is there is no mythology about the Bye Bye Man. There is zero backstory into who or what this creature is. All we know is that he is a creepy man with a creepy dog, and that's it. We don't know why he's terrorizing and killing these people, other than the fact that they say his name. WHY?! Where did that lore come from? Even the most psychotic icons of horror have some backstory into why they are that way. This movie offers you none of that. I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie; I wouldn't recommend renting this movie; I wouldn't even recommend watching this movie for free on Netflix. This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and I've seen some very bad horror movies.",

So, part Freddy Krueger, part Bloody Mary, part The Babadook, and part Candyman, with that entity from It Follows thrown into the mix for good measure. Clearly, there's very little originality on offer here. This probably wouldn't be such a big issue if director Stacy Title had managed to conjure up lots of effective scares or deliver some gross out gore, but her film is light on fright and strictly PG-13 when it comes to content.The plot is also very sketchy in terms of exposition: who is the Bye Bye man? Where does he come from? What is his purpose? Why does he hang around with a poorly rendered CGI dog? Is he a metaphor for mental illness or the product of mass hysteria? (or is that expecting too much from a popcorn horror aimed at a teen audience?). Just a few of the questions that the film fails to answer. Perhaps these issues will be dealt with in a sequel, but I won't be in a hurry to find out. I'm happy to say 'bye bye' to The Bye Bye man. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.",

            "content": "'THE BYE BYE MAN': Three Stars (Out of Five) A horror flick about a supernatural entity that can possess anyone that learns it's name, which terrorizes three college students. It was directed by Stacy Title, and written by Jonathan Penner (of TV's 'SURVIVOR' fame). The script is based on a chapter of the 2005 book 'The President's Vampire', titled 'The Bridge to Body Island' (by Robert Damon Schneck). The film stars Douglas Smith, Cressida Bonas, Lucien Laviscount, Jenna Kanell, Michael Trucco, Carrie-Ann Moss, Leigh Whannell, Erica Tremblay, Cleo King, Faye Dunaway and Doug Jones (as The Bye Bye Man). It's received mostly negative reviews from critics, and fans alike, but it's done really well at the Box Office (so far). I thought it was OK.Three college students (Smith, Bonas and Laviscount) move into an old house, near campus. Once there, they learn about a supernatural entity called The Bye Bye Man (Jones). They also discover that the Bye Bye Man can possess anyone who says or thinks it's name (and make them do horrible things). In order to try and stop the creature, they investigate it's origins. While doing so, they desperately try to stop others from learning about it. They also frantically try not to kill each other, in the process either.The movie is a great concept for a horror flick, and The Bye Bye Man is definitely a frighteningly memorable slasher film villain. I'd like to see a sequel, or maybe more, and hopefully the potential franchise keeps getting better. Penner's script isn't bad though (he also plays a small part in the film), and Title's direction is decent as well. I also can't believe the producers got such an awesome cast for this (Whannell, Moss, Dunaway, Jones!). I'd still recommend seeing it, if you're a fan of horror movies.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/niTBUpMl3sQ",

            "content": "I actually liked this movie. It has some good scares and in my opinion it is fairly creepy. I am an avid horror collector, mostly indie horror, and indie horrors almost always out do Hollywood made horror movies. The bye bye man, though, is one of the better recently made big budget movies. It is pg13 so i don't know what all these negative review people were expecting. I was able to get a copy of the unrated version on blu ray a week before it is actually released in stores. I have not seen the original theatrical version, but oh my was the unrated version good. It had genuinely R rated feeling scenes. It made for quite a surprising experience for me, as i was expecting the typical teenage ghost story where nothing is showed and nothing is scary. The bye bye man has a similar set up to the newer movie \"Satanic\". Although bye bye man is much better on many levels, both movies kind of deal with the whole aspect of finding out about the entity or whatever the antagonist may be. There's no big filler or after sequences of action in this movie. It was devoted to the set up and creepiness of the huge house the college friends buy, and just the idea of the bye bye man with out ever reealllly exploring his origin. Its fast paced, douglas smith is a good actor and is actually in his early thirties!! Lol. AND there's a special guest appearance by Leigh Whannell, who is a horror maestro himself. Personally i am impressed and pleased with this movie. The setting was really creepy and the movie was overall refreshing. It really freaked me out When eliot's neiss wanders up into his bedroom while at his party. When she opens the door in the wall, what happens behind her is super scary. The synchronization of it all is terrifying. I give it a 7. Trust my review. Not the fakes",

This is a movie that you would see on the Chiller network (not a knock on the network). Its a completely generic, non-entertaining, ridiculously stupid waste of time. I went in with a clean slate (apart from thinking the title of the film was laughably dumb) and came out feeling like I really should have known better.The film is about a group of friends that seem to be haunted by a presence known as The Bye Bye Man. This monstrous being has history connected to previous grizzly murders and now this group need to end the Bye Bye Man. Sounds dumb enough, and it is. The three lead characters are terrible. You want them to die. There are shallow, generic, infuriatingly boring and bland. Sometimes you get that with horror films, but I at least want to get behind the characters. Some of the characters and actions are so stupid that I was praying for their characters death. And when it came it was well deserved because of how dumb they are. I'm talking about a specific scene with a train at a railway crossing.The film has nothing amazing going for it visually. The scares (if you can call it that) are so manufactured and tried that even if this was your first horror movie, you still would see it all coming. You want to laugh at how stupid the concept, name, and presence of the being is. Its not even in the so bad its good territory which is a shame because with something with a title like this it should have gone all out in the cheese department.I've been very hard on this film. Its a January release, which is basically the graveyard of Hollywood films. Pretty certain that no one had any faith in this film, and I can see why. You can give me a pen and a pad and a camera and I can write you a more convincing horror film that this. At the very least we have memes of the catchphrase for this film. if anything, its going to go down as a giant joke. Its what it deserves.4/10",

Perhaps people are just obsessed with the lousy \"found footage\" atmosphere or the Ouija boards possessions. I thought it was a rather refreshing considering all the other flicks these days. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it I just put it on for background noise and I thought it was going to be a random crazy fellow killing random people.

Anyways, back to the review.This movie has a good premise, good rules for the supernatural critter to follow, real unease and dread, even among the \"authority\" support characters, and a few good scares.

The plot of the movie is not bad, no one really has addressed this but this is easily the only thing that kept my interested throughout. Not a new idea by any means, but the psychological aspect of the movie kept me entertained. The directing was good. Some shots were pretty cool and some jump scares were actually clever. Depending on how you look at it, one of the jump scares was either a rip off or was inspired by a James Wan jump scare. The movie had the potential to be good and they just dropped the ball. Some people have mentioned how the shot gun deaths were one of the reasons it was a \"bad\" movie. These people are over dramatic. That scene, while head scratching is not going to ruin the movie. Though, it's what they had to do it seems to keep a PG-13 rating based off rumors I'm seeing/reading. If you are a fan horror, go into this movie with low expectations.

The Bye Bye man is one of the better ones I've seen.More of a thriller than a horror,I found the acting solid and felt their was a great chemistry between the three main characters,Cressida Bonas did particularly well in her debut movie and I really enjoyed her performance. The plot was a tad loose but not too bad,tending to concentrate on the three main characters story line rather than boring the watcher with a long drawn out back story,the movie got to the point early and stayed there,which I personally loved about it. The few FX that were needed were well done and the makeup was excellent.

If you have half-decent character development, a semi-plausible plot line, average actors or better, good FX and AT LEAST one or two \"gotcha\" moments, or some combination thereof, I'll give it a good recommendation.Sadly, The Bye Bye Man has none of it.Let's start with back story - there is NONE! (apart from some journalist encountering BBM 30 years before the story takes place). We do not know who BBM is, where he came from, how he came into existence, or why he terrorizes people. This is the biggest flaw that sinks the movie. Perhaps the filmmakers thought if they tell you NOTHING about the boogieman, it will make him more scary. It doesn't - it's disingenuous, at best.Half of the actors give wooden performances, and the other half overact grandiosely. I was particularly distressed to see Carrie Ann Moss and - GASP! - Academy Award winner Faye Dunaway, as they are so much better than this material. I got the impression the producers wanted big names to attract an audience (and maybe Ms. Dunaway really, really needs the money). It was difficult to care for any of these characters.The plot is ludicrous and revolves around the single notion \"don't think it, don't say it\" which, if you analyze it, is antithetical to how people behave. You've got a supernatural boogieman after you, intending to kill you, and you're not going to think about him?!?! C'mon...I did not have one single, solitary moment when I felt tense or ill at ease. There were NO \"gotcha\" moments for me throughout the entire picture, which I found all too predictable. For example, the filmmakers conspicuously place a robe in the bedroom of the two central characters and make it the main focus of the camera angles in several scenes, so that when it comes alive as the BBM, it's simply a yawning moment. In fact, the few times BBM was presented, I was appalled at the lack of creativity in trying to make him anything close to menacing. Makeup and costumes were extremely lacking, as if the filmmakers chose to chop those expenses to meet budget.The only injustice I can think of would be to make a sequel of this mess.",

This movie is still allowed to watch and I have not found it so bad, no need to see a nightmare movie to please, here there are nevertheless suggestive scenes sufficient for me. Good as in all these horror movies, it is not all Evil Dead nor exorcists, but what is certain, to have the scare of their life, then go see a real psychopath for that is cinema, Not the best, but not the worst either, if not do not watch this movie, I note it anyway 7/10.",

Fairly decent storyCons The acting is below average. The story had potential to be really good but seemed to lack in a proper back story and the main characters were lacking any real personality.Overall If you are looking for an amazing horror film then this probably isn't for you.

            "content": "Low budget horror films like Get Out and Lights Out, have been successful both critically and financially. The Bye Bye Man however, has not quite garnered these accolades. What a shame. \"Bye\" (my latest review) may not be the pinnacle of epic fright or the echelon of monumental creep shows. Regardless, it's as good if not better than the two flicks just mentioned.Recently released on DVD and possibly too intense for a PG-13 rating, The Bye Bye Man is a consuming affair. You revert back and jog the ghastly events in your head just as the closing credits come up. Granted, it's no M. Night Shyamalan circa 1999 but heck, what is. This head-jogging notion is similar to the story of \"Bye\" and at the same time, it's also the opposite. The main characters in The Bye Bye Man aren't supposed to think about their ghostly villain (named The Bye Bye Man naturally) or say his name. They'll either die or become possessed with the intent of harming others.Three things to consider before viewing \"Bye\": Don't see this thing alone or in the dark (it's a clich\u00e9, I know). Also, try to realize that it's only a movie and that The Bye Bye Man is not in your reality-based vicinity. Finally, know that you'll never look at raincoats, falling coins, or train tracks the same way again. In terms of direction, well helmer Stacy Title carefully plots the film along. She builds scares to a slow creep, uses minimal gore, and adds decent cameos in the form of Carrie-Anne Moss and Faye Dunaway (where the heck has she been).In jest, \"Bye\" is gnawing psychological terror that only suffers from the occasional, layman acting and an abrupt ending that's barely the sum of its parts. Still, \"Bye\" steadily brings to life the dormant, urban legend of The Bye Bye Man himself (first in 1969 and now in present day). He's hideous, he'll make you hallucinate, and he will feed off of any cancerous attention. Starkly original and worth a look, The Bye Bye Man gets a \"hello\" and a three star rating from me.",

A creature, ghost, entity, whatever, is not defined; He is still a horrifying thing. The first half of the movie gets into it very quickly. We get a decent introduction to all the characters, and then right there everything just starts going down. As the movie progressed I was honestly very gripped by it and the overall feel of the movie was amazing. One of the coolest parts of the movie is how the Bye Bye Man not only affects the characters but the viewer in many ways. I was completely shocked by how well down this movie was honestly. it was a refreshing take on the idea of a boogeyman-type character. Yes this movie may be full of clich\u00e9s, but hey, that hasn't stopped some movies from becoming amazing. The clich\u00e9s actually, in my opinion, worked and helped the story line of the movie.I really recommend anyone who's a casual or big horror fan to watch this movie. Don't go into it thinking it's going to be some amazing Nightmare On Elm Street level horror movie. Go into it with a fresh mind and just experience it. You will not regret it.",

In the present day, several millennials move into this house, which is just off campus, and begin to experience mysterious events that freak them out. They too become aware of the existence of 'the Bye Bye Man', and learn if they even think or say his name, they will be inviting death upon themselves (gee, at least with the Candyman it was five times. And even then you had to look in a mirror...) The Bye Bye Man wasn't even the Say Hello Man, appearing out of nowhere in theatres in early January before saying 'bye bye'...almost immediately. And after watching this execrable dreck, it's not hard to see why. It's a January film all over, one to usher out without much fuss in the early part of the year while everyone's still recovering, that sadly invaded my eyes and my senses, even after it had been on DVD for a while. It's just a typical low rent effort, with slightly glossier production values and cover design, that made it to theatres while a tonne of similar Z grade trash was released straight to DVD.It starts quite intriguingly, however the promising opening fails to tie in coherently with what transpires on screen, which just descends into a load of meaningless guff. No connection is established between the man committing the murders in the house and the kids moving in, other than the whole 'saying or thinking the Bye Bye Man' thing, which they could have done anywhere. At no point is it ever scary or thrilling in any way, and at any rate, all of these youngsters are typically unlikeable, a load of SJW types, the sort who wear t-shirts of bands that were around before they were born (in this case, Joy Division...not even an American band!) and look like an everyday triviality would frighten them half to death, never mind a supernatural monster.I really don't think a horror franchise is going to be established with this one, unless it's an endless stream of straight to DVD non-events, which is really what this monstrosity should be defined as. *",

It's about this creature (or whatever it is, it's never explained) called The Bye Bye Man who plays with your mind when you think of him and gives you all kinds of hallucinations and makes you go crazy. That's why you mustn't even say his name so it doesn't spread.Now the main characters are, obviously, not very smart teens. The acting is one of the worst I've seen lately. Porn actors deliver Oscar-worthy acting compared to the actors in this movie. The lead actor was the only one who looked like he was trying and deliver some more emotion, but then in the second half he just goes full Nicolas Cage and it starts to feel like an overacting contest. At least it will give you plenty of unintended laughs, so if you're going into this movie just for that, you picked the right movie. Now, back to the beginning. The movie opens a bit clich\u00e9d, but actually pretty well done. The opening is surprisingly very atmospheric and intense. But then it all just goes worse, and worse, and worse. The premise is really not bad. This really could have been good. But the writers made zero effort in explaining the story and ignored the logic or sense. Also, they pretty much copied The Ring in some moments and seems like enough horror movies these days already do that.I hate seeing good ideas wasted on terrible movies, this is obviously one of those cases. But, fortunately, that doesn't mean the movie is boring. Actually, it's hilarious when you watch it with someone. So, if you want to see something bad and unintentionally funny, I say go for it.

While Elliot and Sasha's Death Trip may throw a tiny fright into some horror movie rookies, I kept thinking of what my great uncle described from that earlier film. He said that it predicted that the Cheese State's Progressive LaFollett Strong-hold would give rise to horrible Fascist Monsters who would outlaw Unions in Wisconsin and bulldoze millions of America's Medicaid Poor into Mass Graves when they seized national power. Though he recalled that some in his audience were cart-wheeling down the aisles with laughter over such unbelievably Gloomy Prophecies about the Infamous Future in store for a pair of teenage boys then amusing themselves by setting cats on fire and pulling off dragonfly wings, and their Twisted Destiny to sign Pacts with Satan and wreak such Evil in the World, we kids weren't laughing.

Even the title is a clue to the movie's self-awareness: it's The Bye Bye Man, not Bye Bye Man. C'mon, man!None of it makes any sense. Three college kids try to fight insanity together in a house that's either haunted or has a really bad mojo to it. As a fellow movie-goer yelled: \"Move that damn coat!\" Watch out for coins that drop at inopportune times, a laughably-bad CGI blood dog, and the Bye Bye Man himself, who might be a mute cousin of the Emperor Palpatine.What's the biggest enemy? It's a nightstand. The nightstand has the name what you should not think, nor say. Don't say it, don't think it, don't think it, and don't say it. Even the brief amount of time spent at college is devoted to a lesson in epistemology. What is real, and what is nothing more than what we perceive as real?Add further Carrie-Ann Moss, who I'm sure is fully aware anytime she appears we think Matrix, perhaps the ultimate movie about reality vs. unreality.

However, it is a decent horror movie with a good mystery story. The plot is formulaic, and predictable. The acting was decent, the main disappointment was the Carrie Ann Moss as the detective; who looked weak compared to her role as Trinity in the Matrix. The Bye Bye Man looked fake, and so was the hound. Yet, the scenes with the Bye Bye man are the best parts of the movie, and you can overlook the fakeness. This may be due to poor direction. The premise seemed to focus on the actors going mad, but is poorly executed. In fact, Bye Bye Man has a promising premise but ruined by poor direction. The best part was Doug Jones as the titular character was the best part.",

Fast forward to the present, college students Elliot (Douglas Smith), Sasha (Cressida Bonas) who is very tasty , and John (Lucien Laviscount) move into an off-campus house.

So, they start hallucinating. Those hallucinations lead to distrust, misunderstandings, and irrational fear.First and foremost, I really liked the concept. The hallucinations aren't particularly frightening, but I thought they played out well. They help create a sense of doubt in every scene. The film was also paced well, never dragging its feet.

The problem is, The Bye Bye Man never quite develops itself nor does it explain a lot of avoidable mistakes. It's one of those films that is so painful to watch that you wonder, did they make it this bad on purpose? The film with the unfortunate name, is just as unfortunate plot- wise.After moving into an off-campus house with his best friend John (Lucien Laviscount) and girlfriend Sasha (Cressida Bonas), Elliot (Douglas Smith) finds bizarre writing on the inside of a drawer. Etched beneath the lining is \"The Bye Bye Man\". When Sasha expresses her concern that a presence may be in the house, they perform a seance with the help of her psychic friend. It is during the seance that Elliot speaks the entities name out loud, thus unleashing the curse among those who hear it.The supernatural creature quickly gets into their heads, making them see things that increase their paranoia, jealousy and fear. Possessing them in a way that encourages them to commit acts of murder. Which seems to be the only way of stopping others from saying The Bye Bye Man to anyone else.THOUHGTS One of the most prominent flaws with this film was apparent from the start. That is the very unassuming name for this terrifying monster, The Bye Bye Man. It's not frightening at all and it frankly is so ridiculous, it's hard to take the characters seriously when they're saying it with fear in their voice. The character is portrayed by the excellent Doug Jones (Hellboy, Crimson Peak), who is an amazing creature actor. So while his efforts could have potential to create a spooky demonic ghoul, the rest of the film completely ruins all hope.The plot of the film moves fairly quickly. A little too quickly. The characters are so self-aware in an instant. It makes you wonder if they only moved into this creepy old house so one of them could claim it's haunted. Which in itself makes no sense because the house itself is not haunted. It's only by saying \"The Bye Bye Man\" out loud that he gains any power, yet the characters experience a couple supernatural occurrences before anyone sees or mentions the name.Another thing that was so painful with this film was its inability to be serious. One of those rare films you see where you're confused if you're not in on the joke or not. The script is disastrous for a studio film. The amount of cheesy lines, or just set-ups that make no sense was something the entire audience seemed to not be able to get over. It's also very poorly acted, the actress portraying Sasha appeared to be in more of C- student film, rather than a film with a $7.4 million budget.It's hard to be so harsh to a film that tried to be original, but it's flaws were just so glaringly apparent that it's difficult to understand how anyone would give the okay. The very few jump scares this film had, were instantly negated by something ridiculous and comedic. It never quite found it's footing, which could entirely be blamed on a poor script and terribly set up scenes.Don't say it. Don't think it. Don't see this movie.",

Oddly, the immediate competition is Slender Man (2018) which only rated a 3.2, and I for one thought that the scarier movie. Slender Man had a more complicated story, and more complicated characters. That's not to say the The Bye Bye Man is sub-par. It's an excellent horror movie. Where Bye Bye differs it is because the myth spirit is not summoned as in Slender, but takes root thanks to an old creepy house being rented after many years of being empty by a trio of pals. It's very, very bad luck for the trio. Bye Bye is also like a couple of other movies I've seen, Grave Halloween (2013) and The Possession of Hannah Grace (2018), as well as Slender Man, in that the angered spirit aroused is so powerful that very early on you realise everyone is going to die and there is no stopping it. I like this new wave of horror, this wave of no stopping it. All four films mentioned handle this dimension really well, coming up with clever storylines, surprises and character traits that ensure we keep watching and enjoying it, even though we know the outcome. It's all done really well, and in all four cases good special effects really help, as well as overall excellence in filmmaking technique. The actors were very good, and the script believable. I docked Bye Bye a couple of points for the behaviour of the best friend, whom definitely knows what he is seeing is not real but choses to ignore it, or at least, the writers decree that he does. Some will say that's the power of The Bye Bye Man and I've got it backwards. For me though, it didn't make sense and coming near the end it was a bit of a let down. Other than that I really, really enjoyed this horror movie and hope others do too.",

He turns up at an aquatints house with a shotgun, with the main intention of killing those who know of the said name/film title. He repeats the same lines over & over. This is also the film's tagline too. \"Don't Think It. Don't Say It.\" Apparently it's said to keep \"The Bye Bye Man\" away! So, in the present day, a group of friends move into an old home & find a table night stand which has 2 coins inside, with the base of the drawer having the tagline wrote in a spiral fashion, so the main protagonist not only peels the base away to reveal the name of the film, but he says it later on while the group have a seance in the house. You know he & his friends are f*#ked as soon as he says \"The Bye Bye Man\"! They then throughout the rest of the film, try to find a way to defeat the said villain as the have dark twisted visions & hallucinations. I found the film to be above average. It wasn't really good but it wasn't really bad either, so I'd say it was above average considering the effects used & the twists in it. It was an interesting watch & had some sinister moments here & there! The film was an alright watch & I have seen worse horrors than this, but I have seen better also. But it wasn't a bad film to be fair & had some really great visuals, especially The Bye Bye Man himself who looked real sinister!It did lack a few things here & there like gore, but like this film as a whole, I didn't expect too much or expect it to be great or amazing. It was a decent & interesting watch.I would give this one a 6/10. It wasn't amazing, but it was decent enough for a watch & an alright film to start off 2017!",

This isn't necessarily praise, but overall I felt that it was a passable flick, a decent rental. Entertaining for sure, and not just to laugh at. The premise was interesting, and the basis of an idea itself being too terrible to fathom, and spread like death, was intriguing. There was one line, a bit of a monologue, by the main character, that was actually very good. Most of the acting was meh at best, and Carrie-Anne Moss was good but little more than a cameo.

            "content": "Negative impulses can be a real challenge to control, while controlling negative thoughts can seem impossible \u2013 a very unnerving prospect. The simple act of trying not to think about something probably means that you are still thinking about it \u2013 or that the undesirable thought is lurking just beneath the surface of your conscious focus. That's what makes the premise of the supernatural horror thriller \"The Bye Bye Man\" (PG-13, 1:36) interesting. If an evil entity will appear or gain control of your perceptions of the real world, and your will, if you merely think his name, then you're probably fighting a losing battle. And you can't even warn others about the danger because saying his name is just as bad as thinking it.In an otherwise quiet suburban neighborhood on a sunny day in 1969, a man continuously repeats the words \"Don't think it. Don't say it,\" as he retrieves a shotgun from the trunk of his car. He proceeds to shoot several family members and neighbors in order to \"save\" them from an unseen entity known as \"The Bye Bye Man\". The ordinary-looking gunman feels that he has to eliminate those who have learned the name or spoken it to anyone else. After his bloody rampage, he then puts himself out of his misery.Jump to the present day in that same neighborhood. Three college students, boyfriend-girlfriend Elliot (Douglas Smith) and Sasha (Cressida Bonas), and their mutual friend, John (Lucien Laviscount), move into an old, rundown house that they have rented off campus. As they move the furniture which comes with the house up from the basement, they fail to notice that inside the drawer of a small end table, someone has written \"Don't think it. Don't say it,\" in concentric circles. The students do notice that a coin keeps falling to the floor and spinning and that the house is always cold. This leads Elliot to go do some research at the library where a helpful librarian (Cleo King) helps unravel the house's forgotten past. The students also ask a \"spiritual sensitive\" friend named Kim (Jenna Kanell) to conduct a s\u00e9ance.The process of learning about this mysterious \"Bye Bye Man\" results in his name being thought about and spoken out loud, which makes him appear \u2013 and allows him access to the minds of those who know his name. The Bye Bye Man is a gaunt and ghostly man dressed like the grim reaper (and played by Doug Jones) and is accompanied by a ghastly hellhound. When inside the heads of his victims, he makes them see things that aren't there, prompting them to do things they weren't normally do\u0085 with horrifying results. A police detective (Carrie-Anne Moss) becomes involved when things get out of hand, but it's nearly impossible for her to be of any help when those who know what is going on can't tell her about it.Unfortunately, \"The Bye Bye Man\" fails to live up to the potential of its original and frightening premise, the whole thing seeming random and inconsequential. This movie is based on one chapter of Robert Damon Schneck's non-fiction book \"The President's Vampire\" and is supposedly a true story. With that kind of background, screenwriter Jonathan Penner should've been able to set up the plot more effectively \u2013 and written action and dialog that makes sense. And director Stacy Title should've been able to make the movie scarier. And the acting could've been a lot better. And if someone suggests that you come along to see this film, just repeat the main character's name back to them and walk away. \"D\"",

January at the movies; when theaters exude the hangover of Christmas leftovers, Oscar hopefuls and a small number of vacuous lackadaisical new releases that weren't good enough to get a release in the other 11 months on the calendar. This has become the spawning ground for your average negligible PG-13 horror movie, the kind of lazy nonsense guaranteed to play an empty theater. The burnt offering for 2017: The Bye Bye Man, a movie so forgettable that large chunks of the film have already left my brain as I struggle to write this review.The movie is too uninteresting to be terrible, yet so unoriginal as to be almost cute. It has a plot that feels like a patchwork quilt, sewn together from the pieces and parts of other horror movies and, worse, a PG-13 rating that is so in force here that when a person is shot with a shotgun, there is no blood. What blood exists in rest of the film is dyed black for no reason. Added to that, the movie's sole sex scene is edited so badly that we can only deduce that sexual congress is in session because we hear a second or two of moaning. Who was this movie made for? Throughout the movie I got the feeling that maybe I accidentally got a television edit. Surely not one would intentionally make a movie this choppy and nonsensical. I have too much faith in mankind.Not that you give a rat's ass, but there's a plot in place here. It opens with a flashback scene to 1969 wherein a panicky man runs around his neighborhood asking neighbors if they've said a particular name out loud. When they confess that they have, he produces a shotgun and goes on a rampage.Cut to the present day wherein in we meet three uninteresting college students, Elliot (Doug Smith), Sasha (Cressida Bonas) and John (Lucien Laviscount) who are moving off-campus to rent a house so spacious that their parents must be shelling out wads of cash to provide. The kids can barely get in the door when weird things begin to happen. Sasha develops an alarming cough; Elliot finds money that seems to disappear and reappear; and John finds a nightstand with the words \"Don't Say It. Don't Think It\" scribbled inside the drawer. The trio begins seeing things, such as a bizarre cloak in the corner of the bedroom that could easily have been shoved in the closet or thrown away but is, instead, left around because, hey, this movie has to have its fake-out. Right?Standard to the formula Elliot does some research in the library, but he does it via the weakest search engine in the history of mankind. Seriously, when he types in \"Bye Bye Man\" he gets 0 results. How many times have you gotten 0 results for anything on search engine. Even more quizzical is that when he types \"Don't Say It. Don't Think It\" he gets 1 result. What search engine is this?Anyway, he unearths the information that if you say the words \"Bye Bye Man\" it will summon a demon that will alter your perception of the world around you. It's one of those things where you're so scared by the illusion that you end up doing something tragic in real life. Yeah, it's that old dodge.Late in the film The Bye Bye Man does show up. He's a tall, zombie-like being with bone white skin and long fingers. What he does when he corners his victims is a real head scratcher. Apparently, his MO is to walk up to this intended victim and . . . wiggle his finger in their face. Trust me, it makes even less sense when you're watching it. And of course, the major question mark about The Bye Bye Man is that he's played by Doug Jones of Pan Labyrinth and Hellboy and the mother ghost in Crimson Peak. What is he doing in this movie? Heck, what am I doing in this movie?I never knew 98 minutes could feel like an eternity. The movie has a trajectory and it goes there via a lazy screenplay that is hammered together with the bare minimum of effort. But its harmless. PG-13 harmless. \"Goosebump\" harmless. I won't be able to bring myself to put it on the list of the worst films of the year next January. It would be like kicking a puppy.",

The Bye Bye Man is a horrible supernatural horror film that has a direction that's not sure if its trying to make the audience laugh or scared. It has some dull acting, boring direction, and the scares are nonetheless not there. Bye Bye Man has that folk title of a fiction character that once the name is said, he will come with his demonic hound and the people involved would be delusional, see things, makes them want to hurt each other as their weakness is revealed and even kill each other. The plot follows Elliot (Douglas Smith) and his girlfriend Sasha (Cressida Bonas) and friend John (Lucien Laviscount) moving into a house together. They find some old furniture in a basement. And a night stand that constantly drops coins. Once they find a carving of a title The Bye Bye Man inside the drawer and accidentally saying it. Elliot, Sasha, and John will have to do whatever it takes to beat this supernatural force. They have to follow the one rule, of don't think it, don't say it. This film feels like a shadowed version with horror ionic characters like Candyman, Boogeyman, etc. I am sure there are better horror movies that will provide scares than this. This film does lack scares, thrills, and its not even exciting. From the opening moments, of 1960's seeing a man yelling out loud \"don't think it, don't say it.\" And killing people. I love how characters are written to be as dumb as they just stand right in front of the threat as it happens. It gets worse, and more annoying especially when the tagline of don't say it is mentioned quite a lot. Not sure, if its either terrible acting or just cheesy to see on screen. Lets talk about the acting. The acting was horrible and every character is written as one- dimensional. The actors definitely looked like they are reading straight from the script without even building their characters. Elliot may seem like the reasonable caring character, which loves his girlfriend and friend and his brother and niece. Especially, when his brother and niece come by their house a lot. Even at midnight, when Elliot is trying to keep his family away from the bye bye man being noticed by them. One main issue I had was who takes a little girl out to visit their uncle after midnight. Seems kind of late for visiting. Also, I feel like Carrie-Anne Moss talent is wasted here, as she plays a detective trying to figure out these strange webs of murders. She comes and goes on screen. The Bye Bye Man may seem like a creepy character that stands in the shadows in a dark room. But its nothing scary about the guy besides making everyone around him go mad. Besides the movie having a boring direction that does not provide scares and just a bunch young adults trying to survive against this evil figure. Overall, The Bye Bye Man is horrible. Terrible acting, no scares or thrills, and a boring direction. I do not recommend unless you're really bored.",

Unfortunately this one lacks the amazing cinematography as well as decent writing and directing in It Follows. It was pretty predictable in every way and introduced details that were left largely unexplained that made me question whether or not they meant to make a sequel to this movie. The acting wasn't that great either. Unfortunately it becomes glaringly obvious who the veteran actors are because the detective and big brother really shine despite the small screen time they were given. Other than them all the other side characters deliver their lines pretty badly imo (especially the librarian). And the actress who plays the girlfriend is glaringly bad. I was also a bit confused by the scene where she goes to talk to the owner of their rented house and asks about the night stand that started it all because they make you think it would go somewhere but it doesn't and never gets brought up again. The entire scene could've been deleted from the movie and it wouldn't change it one bit. The upside though is that you do get to enjoy a really awkward exchange between her and the house owner, a close up of her wooden facial expression as she delivers her lines and her hilariously bad fake sneeze. She literally says \"achoo!\"Overall if you don't take this movie seriously then it can actually be quite funny and I think that is its saving grace. The bad acting and dialogue and even the way in which some of them died had me cracking at times.",

            "content": "A cross between the \"Candyman\" franchise (which is awful), the \"Final Destination\" series (which is fun but formulaic and utterly predictable) and all the boogeyman horror films ever made. TBBM bravely explores insanity, discovering that nobody ever suddenly commits evil deeds on a whim or due to being intrinsically evil but is driven to those heinous acts by a bored boogeyman who has nothing better to bloody do than have people kill each other. Don't those silly demons have a life? (Well, no, they're dead...) No proper hobbies? (Isn't killing random people a valid, \"proper\" hobby? An interesting philosophical question.) All they seem to know how to do is harass humans, trapping them into inescapable curse vortices that lead to blood devastation horror and scream bloody gore.Insanity doesn't exist, at least not the natural, genetic variety. We know that now. (Shrinks will be out of jobs. Finally!) The movie told us. So through this fact alone TBBM is a classic that transcends cinema, actually overlapping into great scientific hence by default also historic significance.In other words, Ellen Degeneres and Barbra Streisand aren't truly insane. They just said the name \"Bye Bye Man\" (and what a dumb name it is) one too many times - which means at least once, because once it all it takes to go cuckoo.Speaking of kooky celebrities, right after I finished the movie I googled \"insane celebrities\" (for the review you're reading right now), and the first result I got is a list of 25 crazy celebs. Guess who starts off the list?Faye Dunaway. I kid you not. Google what I googled and you'll find out I'm not lying.Faye Dunaway. She is in this movie. Talk about weird. Hell, this kind of absurd coincidence can't be explained by science! I must be mad! The Bye Bye Man has cursed me for daring to type his name on my laptop! Sure, his rule clearly says \"don't write it\" i.e. it never said \"don't type it\" but I guess The BB Man isn't a stickler for detail and for rigidly obeying rules - even his own bloody rules. (Typical sociopath.)Faye is an awful actress. But just as it's not her fault that she's crazy (it's BB Man's doing), it's also not her fault she can't act anymore. It's her plastic surgeons. They did such a number on her that she isn't capable of showing emotions anymore - any emotions. This kind of cheapens the film (further), because she makes an appearance just as things are really heating up plot-wise. Douglas Smith goes to her house to talk to her as the mass-murderer's widow, but there he finds Faye, not looking like a widow so much as looking like a duck beak was slapped on her with permo-glue. (She can only play Howard the Duck's widow now, but (un)fortunately that franchise snuffed it a while ago.) The same glue by the way that the casting director is a fan of, especially before making the final decision as to who should play various widows in boogeyman-based horror films. If he likes ducks so much he should direct Disney cartoons instead.The blonde love-interest looks hundred times better than Faye but acting-wise she isn't that much better. She is in real life Prince Harry's ex. He must have married the wrong actress because this one might not have cut off his ties from the golden goose, the way his current wife has. Oh well, Princess Diana was no Einstein either... Inbred blood is thicker than inbred water.Anyway... this actress is some sort of British royalty, just like silly ginger Harry, hence why she is a model, actress... The usual elitist nepotism that Hollywood loves to practice - while pretending to be equal-opportunity working-class communists. Remind me again how many working-class people get to work in Hollywood? Except as carpenters I mean.But the movie's biggest flaw, by far, isn't the cast, not even the overall clumsiness in the dialog and some rather silly situations. It's the lopsided battle between good and evil, the biggest disease of modern horror. Bye Bye Man (I feel damn silly writing his name, I feel more cringe than fear, to be honest) is so utterly powerful, literally like a god, whereas the students are so hopelessly powerless and overwhelmed, unable to perform any magic tricks whatsoever, so that it's pretty obvious from the get-go that they have zero chance in winning this war. In fact, between the three of them they didn't even win a single battle against the boogeyman. Modern horror films are so drenched in nihilism i.e. hip pessimism/cynicism that almost 90% of them have \"downer endings\". This by now almost traditionalist zeal for ending films this way has lead to a level of predictability that's never existed in cinema before. Why would you expect a viewer to get involved in the protagonists' struggle if the struggle is doomed to failure nearly every time? This is one of the several key reasons why horror fans are getting increasingly bored with American horror films. Start giving the heroes a fighting chance and the audiences might be complaining less of being bored.Towards the end, when BB Man approaches Douglas Smith (1:25:30), I had a stark sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu with heavy doses of \"Star Wars\": Douglas Smith resembles Hayden Christensen and the boogeyman is a dead ringer for a Sith lord. It was a bizarre moment. Though not nearly as bizarre as the illogical behavior of Douglas's brother and his daughter in the final scenes. Or the fact that this young girl was brought along to a student party, around the beginning of the film, even allowed to roam unsupervised. What was that all about? Was she offered beer-bongs then?",

Question: If I repeat the words \"don't think it, don't say it\" as if it were a mantra, aren't I still thinking about it? I, mean anyone who's been through a terrible breakup will probably tell you when you say \"don't think about it,\" your mind automatically wonders back to one who broke your heart. Also, are the people cursed by this year's newest disposable apparition aware that \"bye-bye, man,\" is a fairly common turn of phrase? So does that mean everyone who says that at any point in their life is affected by the curse or only after they've discovered it exists? The Bye Bye Man is the name of this year's newest disposable horror film apparition. He appears when you say his name, his influence spreads with every utterance and he can be challenged once you've become wise to his game. So he's basically a hybrid of Freddy Krueger, the Candyman and the \"It\" in It Follows (2014) only with a look and feel stolen from a Lab Rats music video. Truth be told, the setup does have possibilities. A minor character refers to him as a reaper so perhaps something salient could have been said about the specter of death and how it can warp our behavior. Or perhaps The Bye Bye Man could be a parable of forgotten history. Another minor character makes the point that once you bury the story, \"It's like it never existed.\" The movie could have been an exploration of mass hysteria, a project exploring groupthink, exploring mental illness, exploring the never-ending march of time\u0085It could have explored a lot of things is what I'm saying.But no The Bye Bye Man is essentially about a group of university students who stumble onto a haunted nightstand and barely grasp its implications. We get our macho jock (Laviscount), our pretty and popular female lead (Bonas), our creepy outcast (Kanell) and our pale-faced protagonist (Smith) who fights his fate while wearing band t-shirts that are far too old for him. Veteran actresses Carrie-Anne Moss and Faye Dunaway also make appearances in contrived, unnecessary scenes that are there to point out the filmmakers didn't properly utilize their shooting schedule. Thus we're pretty much stuck with our fresh-faced meat-sacks for the duration of this film.And while we're stuck with them, our group of heroes seems to be hopelessly stuck in a plot that is actively working against them. They start the obligatory parade of clich\u00e9s by having a housewarming s\u00e9ance. They then immediately fall into false frights, unexplained phenomena, and a second act investigation requiring one or more of them to rummage through library records. All the while, any chance to flesh out our characters is eschewed in favor of everyone yelling \"who did you tell!\" The only time we're offered a respite from the painfully expected and familiar is when we get heavily edited flashback scenes of the Bye Bye Man tormenting a reporter (Whannell) who got a little too nosy for his own good. These scenes approach the quality of mediocre dinner theater.At one point early in the film, Elliot yells from the other room \"Let's watch something stupid,\" to his girlfriend who is distracted by haunting noise. We then cut to them sleeping. That in a nutshell is The Bye Bye Man. It's a lazy, boring and predictable movie that at times feels edited beyond comprehension.

He defies the laws of physics, drives his victims mad, and has been spotted in old photographs, observing ominously. To make a long story short: Doug Jones reprises his role as Slender Man (Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story) albeit with a far sillier name and an actual face to show. I wish I could say that that's the only film The Bye Bye Man derives ideas from, without any aspiration to subvert or freshen them up, but here we are.On top of its cookie-cutter script and remedial horror film tactics (Do I even need to say the word \"jump scare\"?), the film offers porno-level performances and characters that explain to each other who they are in a manner that's, well, whatever the antonym of the word \"seamless\" is. We mainly follow a trio of youngsters (Douglas Smith, Lucien Laviscount and Cressida Bones) who stumble upon the origins of an evil entity known as The Bye Bye Man after one of them develops an inexplicable cough and weird scribblings are found. Again, totally not a Slender Man movie.What we (and the protagonists) soon learn is that The Bye Bye Man has influenced the evil of mankind for several decades, as there are several documented cases where teenagers have committed mass murders and left notes behind reading \"The Bye Bye Man made me do it\". Even though we finally have an explanation for all the shootings and hate crimes that have taken place in recent memory, provided I've understood the premise of this film correctly, I am also to understand that The Bye Bye Man has only existed since the 1960's. So I guess he wasn't around during The Holocaust or the Dark Ages and cannot be blamed for all of the world's horrors. Just a couple.Also in on the fun are Carrie-Anne Moss as a generic hard-ass cop (who is astoundingly quick to buy into the main characters' \"It wasn't me, it was the tall ghost dude\" routine) and Faye Dunaway as Cameo #2. At least these two are watchable, which is more than I can say for some of the lesser-known actors. I can recommend watching Jeremy Jahns' review of this film (even as I've come to regard him as more of a \"dude who loves movies\" than an educated critic like Mike Stoklasa or Adam Johnston), in which he includes an anecdote about how he watched it at a special screening hosted by the cast and crew, and how the viewers would laugh whenever Cressida Bones said or did anything - whilst she was most likely in the theatre with them, mind you. Ouch.In other areas, the film is similarly amateurish, to the point where I must question if it truly belongs on the big screen and not on the same hard drive as some of the embarrassing student films I made in 2013 before I became (relatively) more careful with what I upload to YouTube. I suppose it technically has better sound, visual effects and editing than that, but the cinematography and writing are pretty down there.Still, the film could have worked in the hands of someone else, or perhaps even these same people if the budget wasn't so low. I liked the shot where Doug Jones' character appears as a silent silhouette in the main character's bedroom (even if a mandatory pop scare kills its effect) and I'd love to see the repulsive hound that occasionally turns up, done with better CGI.",

The female of the group starts hearing a coin being tossed and strange noises. After they fix the place up, they have a party, after which they conduct a seance with Kim, who has physic abilities. During the seance, she feels like something is coming and Elliott who is skeptical blurts out \"The Bye Bye Man\" and the candle blows out. It kind of reminds me of the movie \"the Ring\" or \"Candyman\". I like horror movies that don't depend on gore or sex to sell the plot. That's not scary, I want to be startled or be tempted to cover my eyes. The thought that someone is waiting around the corner, that's what gets you. There were a couple of really good scares in this movie and the audience seemed to jump more than once.",

Watching his face contort with the inner turmoil of one whose suffering is too much to bear, but who cannot share it with another soul, Douglas Wilson turns in what, in another movie, could be an Academy Award winning performance of a man with schizophrenia.He is repeatedly victim of apparent hallucinations, all of which seem to be leading him toward senseless violence. Hurting people he loves, and perhaps, more likely, hurting himself.This will be familiar to anyone who has ever known someone who suffers from mental illness. Wilson's portrayal is close to heartbreaking.I was surprised that \"The Bye Bye Man\" never opens the door to that kind of ambiguity, never suggesting that the spectres within it could be evidence of a fractured mind, and not supernatural in origin.What we have here, nevertheless, is a superior horror movie with a stand-out performance in the lead. It never scared me very much, but it involved me throughout, and, for once, it was not predictable.For the life of me, I just cannot fathom its woeful 4.3 rating on this very website. Clearly something went very wrong for most viewers of \"The Bye Bye Man\", and I can't guess what.",

A story about this \"thing\" called, The Bye Bye Man, that whenever you think or say it's name it gets closer and closer to you to kill you, and the fact that it's hard to not think about something you already know of, that can be pretty scary. HOWEVER, this movie did not execute it well! My first issue was, THE ACTING!!!!!! The only person I could stand was Elliot. Elliot's girlfriend was too much...like it felt like she thought she was in like a high school play or something. It just got to the point where I literally said to myself, \"Can they please stop giving this girl lines...\" Everyone else is tolerable. Just...that girl...The writing was pretty awful too! Where's the back story of The Bye Bye Man??? Why whenever he's near you hear coins dropping and hear a train coming...who is this dude? What is he? Where did he come from? Who, what, when, where, and how...nothing made sense. The only \"back story\" we actually got was of a writer who really was of no real importance at all...Now, did this movie have scary parts, I mean...sure. But every time something scary would happen, you're pulled back out with either bad acting or bad direction. I hate seeing movies with potential, go to waste...like this movie was just so bad...Should you watch this, I mean...yes/no. If you're like SUPER BORED, on a road trip trying to pass time, or something along those lines, sure watch this. If you want a film you can enjoy and be scared by, just ignore this movie..",

As you can see by the actors listed above, they are not household names. The only good thing about it is there are a couple of good cameos; I remember seeing Cleo King, Carrie- Anne Moss and Faye Dunaway-Yes, I said Faye Dunaway! The plot goes like this; 3 college kids move into a house off campus and unbeknownst to the trio, the house has a secret. It seems that a reporter had been doing some research on a teenager that had went on a killing spree, saying that the Bye Bye Man made him do it. Legend of the Bye Bye Man goes that if you say his name or even hear it, then you are his next target. The reporter is next and then the college kids. What happens when you are BBM's target? You kill anyone that has said or heard the name and then you kill yourself. The Bye Bye Man does not actually do anything! All he does is make people see things that are not there! He doesn't physically do anything! Douglas, Cressida and Lucien are the college kids and Doug is the Bye Bye Man. Oh yeah, people keep repeating the phrase, 'Don't say it! Don't think it!' a lot. I guess it's supposed to make the Bye Bye Man seem scarier or something. It's rated \"PG-13\" for terror, violence, bloody images, language, teen drinking and sexual content-including partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes. I wouldn't buy it on DVD. I wouldn't rent it either. Avoid this one in the theaters. If you really must see it then I would wait until it comes to cable TV.",

And after finding out that this was supposedly based on a chapter from a book about urban legends, and reading the legend, I really, really wish the movie makers had gone into more details about everything!Instead, there were just some references and appearances about possible connections to something more interesting, while we watched three people's insecurities about relationships get the better of them.Questions that I wanted answered in the movie:-- What was the deal with the train?\n-- What was the deal with the clutter around the train track?\n-- Where did all this begin?\n-- Why didn't he burn the end table instead of just tossing it into the woods?\n-- What was the dog? WAS it a dog?\n-- Was it all in their heads? Or was the Man real?\n-- Why does his name make people go nuts and kill their loved ones and themselves?\n-- What was the deal with the coins? Why couldn't they stay on solid surfaces like desks and in drawers, but didn't fall through floors?\n-- Why was Trinity in this?

For starters, the evil force in this particular movie hardly makes any appearances, believe it or not. Most of the horror instead comes from the various characters having hallucinations. While I guess this could have been a successful approach, it doesn't work here. After the opening scene depicting a (small scale) rampage in the past, the movie for the next fifty or so minutes can't come up with anything that is all that terrifying, at least if you don't count the second flashback that happens. The so-called scary stuff that happens in this first (slow) half of the movie is just people having mild hallucination - hardly terrifying, if you ask me. Although the second half of the movie does start to try and deliver the goods (it really pushes its PG-13 rating, by the way), it's still not all that involving, one reason being that there is no real explanation as to how The Bye Bye Man originated and why he does what he does. In the end, the movie is simply unsatisfying in any angle you can think of. Let's hope this franchise wannabe doesn't spawn any sequels.",

With help from the only survivor of the massacre (Faye Dunaway), Elliot sets out to stop Bye Bye.Badly acted in both eras by actors who don't deserve the title, this inept adaptation of an obscure work of crypto-fiction is amateurish at best - the villain is derivative and the scares are nonexistent.

The plot nor the characters evolved. A lot more could have been done with the characters. The emphasis of this movie was on The Bye Bye man but seemed to focus more on the main character Elliot's struggle to beat this thing who had little screen presence.The actors were all great.For a horror movie there weren't any scary scenes that i could think of and the cgi hound really ticked me off. It wasnt realistic at all and made The Bye Bye man a bit laughable . I'm sure they could have created a more realistic hound.I will say the concept of this dark, powerful, supernatural power causing people to murder is a great idea and feels relevant to the nonsensical murder suicides that we see today.",

It's basically saying our intention is to scare you, but we are going to handicap ourselves in the process and likely fail for this reason. And shock horror, 'The Bye Bye Man' is one of the tamest horror movies out there. Not only is the action that does occur either very bland or happens off-screen, even then there's barely any of it. About 45 minutes into the film I was asking myself why exactly I was supposed to be a afraid of this creature considering it hasn't actually done anything yet (other than confuse a few teenagers about what they were actually seeing).Every flaw that modern horror movies tend to have is evident in some respect in this film. The characters are completely generic, unlikeable and unrelatable. The frights (though to be fair there were very few of them) are simply jump-scares which often have little to do with the story at hand. The biggest annoyance for me though was the implausibility. Now to be fair, very few horror movies don't have any implausibility, it's kind of a given. But when your story is as far-fetched and contrived as it is in the 'The Bye Bye Man', you have to wonder what the point is. How anyone could be made to feel uneasy about a subject as completely illogical as this I will never know.There's really not a lot of good things to say about this film. It achieves in absolutely no area. The fact that this film made it to cinemas is beyond me. Even with today's incredibly low standards of horror movies, 'The Bye Bye Man' is terrible.",

It's a horror film so I would expect all the ills of society to come out and play, unfortunately the film tires quickly leaving me wanting much much more. The main characters are not fully defined and have the personality of warped wallpaper; granted they summon this evil spirit that resembles the grim reaper from Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, twenty minutes later.

It gets you with the superficial something is in the corner fright that anyone who paid to see the movie would want to experience, but it does not take long to get use to the Bye Bye man, and then what?

Let's just say I didn't find myself perusing my meme page while watching. It gives just enough glimpses of what the bye bye man looks like, without giving it away right up front. I'm not a fan of when the monster/demon/ghost etc are revealed fully right off the bat. You had to pay attention and actually what is happening to the characters and why. I can kind of understand a bad review if you prefer everything just be laid out for you. I like the ones where you have to wonder a little. It wasn't painfully predictable either. I mean, as far as horror movies go, people lost their minds over the Paranormal Activity movies (which honestly still blows my mind). But this is the kind of movie i feel would do well with a sequel.

The friends must try to save each other, all the while keeping The Bye Bye Man's existence a secret to save others from the same deadly fate.Plus Points:1)First 10 minutes: The movie started interestingly with a person going on a killing spree those who know some mysterious name.It raised hopes on film.Minus Points:1)No scary scenes,Terrible Screenplay and Flawed Direction: Still I couldn't know the reason how this movie got a theatrical release.Director Stacy Title failed in every aspect of making a horror film.There is not even a single scary scene even when they tried lot of jump scares.Mystery element is dragged beyond the limit and that too shown in a pathetic way.The movie is terribly staged and poorly edited. Literally, scenes don't match up, with action being cut off and having nothing in common with the next sequence. It's odd.It's mainly run-of-the-mill jump scares and predictable haunted-house shtick that brings absolutely nothing new to the genre.Its a common act that we make fun on horror films while watching with friends but while watching The Bye Bye Man,I made fun remarks even watching it alone.So,The Bye Bye Man is a terrible horror film with literally no jump scares,pathetic screenplay and flawed direction.One of the Worst films of all timeAs referred in film, Don't Think It Don't Say it....I would add Don't watch it too..My rating 3.5/10",

The Bye Bye Man lingers so heavily to the point of where many of it's elements make it simply fall apart.We pretty much follow the story of Elliot, Sasha, and John, three college students who rent a home for themselves, only to be provoked by The Bye Bye man, after the past comes to haunt them, as part of the house they've rented. First off, really, if you're looking for a horror film that breaks down the whole origin of this entity, by no means will you get it. The Bye Bye Man / entities' origin, and reasoning behind all of the events it causes is truly never explained in the film, honestly coming off as an unexplained collection of scares, and movie fillings toward the characters. Throughout this entire movie, the characters all constantly get into ordeals with the entity, only giving the audience more of a want / wonderment toward the entity himself, only to be let down when the whole situation of the entity is never explained; The entire movie centers around this Bye Bye Man, and in the end, he, nor his doings and origins is never explained, and left out completely. Throughout the film, we get the characters figuring out pieces to the entities' puzzle, honestly the typical, and clich\u00e9 \"Old / dead document that can't be found anywhere else until now\" gimmick seen in many, many other horror films. The characters all search, and find ways to stop temporarily, and prevent shortly the entity from provoking them, but really that's just about it. Time, after time until another character just randomly dies from this entity, these characters are all running around solving pieces of this entity, for what seems to be fill time; Absolutely no reasoning, really. Overall, really just a ton of, in the end, pointless doings toward an entity the film is entirely revolved around, yet overall never explains, nor goes in depth with such entity / entities to even begin with, rendering pointless, truly. Continuing, the acting in this movie was honestly a split. The character of Sasha honestly didn't fully live up to emotional showings, overall at a good chunk of lines sounding flat, and not truly in the zone of what specific scenes called for, the actor of Elliot, and John, surprisingly, however pulled a solid job with such emotions, and overall acting toward their situations. Moving even further, the films' displaying of events. There were parts where a character gets shot, or injured, and that character would sit, and absolutely no blood would be shown. There would be parts too reliant on CGI, coming off cheap looking, and blatantly fake, and out of place looking, for example a scare tactic that looked so out of proportion, it left a good amount of the audience in complete confusion. And as said before, there'd be happenings where the audience has no idea what to make of due to a major lack of information on the entity, example being his doings, and actions toward the characters.In conclusion, this films' plot, story-line, and in-depth execution was extremely flat, and extremely incoherent when given deep thought. The Bye Bye man, and other entities that built this films' hype up was shown, but no background prevailed, and overall would seem as if these entities were just thrown in for scare tactics, and story fillings. The story executed in a clich\u00e9, and overly done matter that didn't differentiate itself from what's been done before, the characters, for the most part did pointless actions that amounted to nothing story / plot changing with the exception of some scenes; Which is one of the very few things that can be said. And overall the CGI, and some shots shown looked quite off, and questionable that lead to an audience- wide reaction. To wrap things up, there's a reason, again this was pushed quite a few times. The Bye Bye Man, overall had extremely low redeeming qualities such as a twist or two, but overall amounted to nothing, quite literally, and even more so executed some of the most pointless actions that lead to, once again, nothing. I'd recommend seeing this when it's out of the theaters, The Bye Bye Man wasn't worth the push back wait, overall, and was a disappointing start to horrors' 2017.",

Of course, tastes are highly subjective, but the scathing, \"worst movie ever\" type comments here are just ridiculous.Is Bye Bye Man a brilliant, must-see horror? No, not at all. Is the acting Oscar-worthy? No, but I've seen plenty worse. Actually, it didn't bother me. Someone here mentioned things not making sense. What? I'm not sure. It was all pretty straightforward, supernatural premise aside. I found the first quarter to be genuinely creepy and well-paced. Once we know what's going on, it goes a bit silly. But that's almost the recipe for these kinds of movies.I gave it a solid 6 because it entertained me (on the particular night, and in the particular mood, I watched it.) I've watched countless horror movies and I can be a snob when I want to. I usually have no time for the CGI-laden, clich\u00e9-ridden fare that passes for horror these days. Bye Bye Man, while certainly approaching that, had just barely enough of something interesting to make it better than many. It's no masterpiece, but it also isn't the 1-star material that others here will have you believe. I wonder how many Andy Milligan films they've seen?",

So the basic core makes no sense and all the rest is typical nonsense. Why are you forced to say his name if he can do that why not force everyone in the world to say his name. Why doesn't he chop up the desk and burn it. If he can control it sometimes and not other times isn't that just for plot convenience?

But the movie we got was so inept and so bad that whatever chance it had died an early and forgotten death. In other movies where there's a supernatural kind of killer there is always a backstory. There's a reason for the killer to be so crazy. Not here. We're told of a guy that killed a bunch of people for speaking the name of this entity. That's it. That's all the backstory we get. Well, not exactly. There's a librarian who later on is only there to provide exposition. In a less clunky movie they would have found a better way to provide this to the audience. A bunch of college students move into this house because it's close to campus, it's cheap and they want to live together. They find an old nightstand and in the drawer is written over and over again the lines don't think of it, don't speak of it over and over again. Ripping that paper away we see the title carved into the drawer. It had to be because otherwise there literally would be no story.And once the name is spoken weird things start to happen and that's basically the movie from then on. It's not coherent as to what is happening, it's just stuff. The man that killed the people at the beginning is just there with no real connection to the supernatural killer. At no point is this scary or thrilling or anything other than you want these kids to die because they're so annoying. This is one of the best examples of a January movie. It came out after the holidays. It's dumped into theaters because they need to show something. It's a PG-13 movie to get all the kids to go see it. And it's just something to be avoided.",

The good news is, if you are not a horror film fan, you possibly would enjoy it. But those who love and watch horror films regularly would find it somewhat a waste of time. I was the first one, and I thought it was better than some of the recent big names from the same genre.Yeah, looks a mix of plenty of films. It was somewhat like 'It Follows', but less complicated. Easy to follow the characters and the story. Though from the beginning itself, it was very intentional. A decent cast and the filmmaking. It could be scary for some viewers, but I found a little edgy and well paced narration. But sadly it did not miss any of the usual horror flick formula. One of the most overused, not just in this film, but any horror films is that those film character interviewing the one of the survivours from the past. So if you don't mind such common usage, it is an acceptable film.6/10",

Gave me a good first impression and my expectations rose, but then the leads enter, and the first thing that hits you are extremely hollow and stereotypical characters. The female lead is really bad and awkward to watch, and the lead guy's friend is just a caricature. The lead guy is fine, but sadly, Carrie-ann Moss is sadly just a cameo. I really wish she and Douglas Smith would be the leads, which would be far more interesting.2. The plot is all over the place. It seems like they had a good idea to begin with, but completely lost its way during production. There's no real explanation of anything, and it just makes everything pretty dumb. When you're glad leading characters are dying to stop watching them act \u2013 it's really bad.3. Clish\u00e8s after clish\u00e8s.... Seen it all before. The trailer was much better than the movie itself. 4. Bad special effects. There is a computer generated hell's hound in this, and it looks like something out of an old playstation game.

So, I looked it up, found it on Netflix!!\u2714 I then I pulled it up on IMDB and saw it had a great cast!! \u2714 You have an up and coming actor who looks like a young Shemar Moore(be still your hearts ladies!), Carrie-Anne Moss, Faye Dunaway, & one of my ALL - TIME FAVORITE actors, Mr Doug Jones!!! Doug has been in SO MANY movies, like Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth, but many people don't realize it's even him, because he's Hollywood's Master of Disguise!!! Add in Douglas Smith, who was in Percy Jackson, a favorite of my son& mine, and you have a recipe for a great movie!However, somebody didn't follow the recipe right, and burnt the cake! The Bye Bye Man is - to put it simply -a rip- off of every horror movie with a baddie that shows up when you awaken him and he comes after you either when you're sleeping or when you speak his name or something of the nature. The babadook, Nightmare on Elm Street, and there's a lot more I could name they've all been ripped off to make this movie. There's a lot of movies exactly like this going around right now. The only unique thing that I can see is that the bye bye man had a dog creature, and confoundingly enough, there's something to do with 2 gold coins which aren't really gold coins when you look at them they're silver, but apparently when they show up so does he. I say confoundingly enough because there's no real explanation in fact for pretty much everything in the movie there's not a whole lot of explanation! There's no back story as to who the bye-bye man is, where he came from, why he's doing what he's doing, why people feel that they have to kill everyone who knows his name or his heard it, it's just very bizarre! Now I'm not saying it's a bad movie, there's just so many frayed Ends sticking out there is that it's frustrating when a movie is a rip-off to begin with, but to not have any explanation as to the things that are going on, it makes for a really rough watching. Quite honestly I kept checking the time to see how much more I had to sit through, several times I considered just quitting, and that's not good. A movie should be entertaining and you shouldn't have to wonder how much longer you had to sit through a movie!Now my positives and negatives. Positives would be there's a great cast, I think they did a real wonderful job of picking who they did and the whole group was quite believable! I would have liked to have seen more out of Doug Jones, I don't think he in particular had enough time on the screen, but he sure was terrifying! That's why he always does best! The camera work was good, no complaints there! The outside of the house was quite beautiful and the yard was scenic and absolutely the kind of place I would want to live! Now to the negatives. I was trying to force myself to come up with positives cuz there's just so many negatives. And this is going to be hard to try not to give things away cuz I don't want to have to say their spoilers here. The script was just awful. It was a total rip-off of the genre, could they not come up with something more unique? At the very least put some unique spin on it so it's the same genre but in a way that no one's ever seen it before? I think the writers ought to be flogged! The house was just unbelievable. It was beautiful outside, but inside it was a disaster! It had the same wallpaper from the 70s? Things were falling apart and in extreme disrepair? It just didn't match it made no sense! Plus, from the outside you could see a bunch more rooms then when you're showing the inside, there aren't as many rooms as there should be by looking at the windows from the outside! So somebody did an oopsie! Some of the plots smaller side plots we're ridiculous too, like the librarian going home and killing her children, why would she do that? She didn't have to tell her children the name, and I don't understand this whole thing of If someone knows the name you have to kill them. Why? Why do you have to kill them? I can understand the desire to kill yourself, but why do you have to kill someone else? Again another proof of this whole plot being absolutely ridiculous! I think someone just wanted to throw together and move you real quick to try to make a bunch of money. It fell flat on its face. This movie is a stinker! That's why I only got three stars! And out of those three stars, all three of them are only there because of Doug Jones! I would give this movie a0 if it weren't for him!Now I'm not saying don't watch the movie, because I honestly think that some people might enjoy it, and if you don't try to think, and just watch it and go on with your life, maybe you'll get some kind of enjoyment out of it that's up to you not me but to me it was pretty awful because I had to force myself to watch it.

But then I started wondering what happened to scenes--it cuts from the middle of a fight to people in bed like they left the rest of the fight on the editing room floor. I became gradually more aware of the bad acting, and not long after that, it sunk in that the writing was pretty awful too. From there, it became laughable: lingering shots on unimportant things, undetectable character motivation, truly terrible dialogue, and a villian that just wasn't frightening. And let's not forget, one tiny section of wallpaper comes alive and growls even though there's no character there to observe it, as if the audience will feel menaced be a wallpaper dog. Seriously.

In the present day, Elliot, his girlfriend Sasha, and his friend John move into a house off campus. Kim leads them in a seance where she goes into a trance repeatedly telling them, \"Don't say it. Don't think it.\" It's the Bye Bye Man. Detective Shaw (Carrie-Anne Moss) investigates with the bodies piling up.The idea that the boogeyman exists only due to the stories that we pass on to each other is an intriguing one. It's an idea filled with great possibilities. Sadly, the execution is poor and any potential is squandered. The start with the flashback is fine although it could use more tension. It may work better to start with a victim's point of view. It's generally fine. The first real problem comes with Elliot. He's a douche. It's more than simple rooting interest deficiency. These young people are supposed to deteriorate with delusions and mania as the hallucinations take hold. Elliot starts as a douche and the delusions don't change him that much. He needs to start as the hero or at worst neutral. He shouldn't be a douche. The other issue is presenting the premise with an easy progression of expositions. I'm not sure how Elliot or anybody is able to figure out the movie's central premise. The lead character should be a literary expert or folklore student. It needs to be an ancient myth or connected to present-day superstition. They can't just come up with the premise out of the blue. Aside from that, this horror is rather derivative. The intensity is low. The characters aren't compelling and the young actors aren't charismatic enough to excel. The movie deteriorates into uncompelling horror action.

            "content": "Everything about this film is wrong. It is terrible in every single way.\nFirst, the writing: The three central characters are not characters. They are puppets, simply existing to further the \"plot\". Frankly, the dialogue is a mockery of the English language. At one point, a character says \"you know I can't read in the dark, I'm not a flashlight\". NOBODY TALKS LIKE THIS. The plot is derivative, and is clearly just a set up for a potential sequel, that will never happen if there is any justice in the world.\nSecondly, the direction and shot composition. Admittedly, the shot composition in this film is at times, competent. However, the director seems to think that just because you put in a long shot or a tracking shot, you are the next Kubrick. Additionally, the budget of this film should not allow it to look like a cheap, lazy student film.\nThirdly, the acting: Doug Jones is a fantastic actor. Carrie Anne Moss and Faye Dunaway are fantastic actors. But even the best actors have to be given CHARACTER to act well. There are no even half decent characters in this film, only cut outs that are made even blander by the cast. This film is not a character driven piece. The actors in this are absolutely atrocious, and I continuously question how they ever got past an audition process. The main actor isn't even a bad actor in everything, there is one scene in this where he is actually pretty good. This really does show that the director of this film has no idea how to work with humans.\nThe Scares: Barney the Dinosaur is a scarier villain. Barney is creepy, the Bye Bye Man is just an excuse for jumpscares, all of which are predictable and almost patronising in their blatant. The CGI in this film is also terrible, only ever used for gore and the Bye Bye Man's horrendous looking dog. You can practically taste the pixels on that dog. It isn't scary. This film would be a lot more interesting if the Bye Bye Man wasn't called that, and if you never saw him. EVER. His presence is not creepy. It is not disturbing. It is goofy and distracting. If I wanted to watch a creepy talk guy appear in random places to scare the main character, I'd watch Sinister instead. At least the villain from that film doesn't look like a de-shelled turtle man.The constant switching of characters through the Bye Bye Man's powers ISN'T CLEVER. The internal logic of this film does not hold up at all, in fact. Several times, the viewer is left wondering \"so what can the Bye Bye Man actually do?\" and \"why are there seven Elliots?\". There is no thought or effort put into this film. None. None whatsoever. I'm actually offended that this was released in cinemas. Nothing matters in this film. There are no consequences for anyone or anything. The main characters all die? We don't care! There is nothing to make us care.This film is actually one of the worst films ever, people complain about horror films these days and I can see why when they produce such garbage like this. The only reason this film gets more than 1 star is because it is so much fun to sit back and mercilessly mock this film. I have legitimate hatred towards the people that directed and wrote this film. It's not suspenseful. It's not scary. It's not interesting, and most importantly, it isn't purposeful. This film has no point to make. Maybe there's an allegory for mental illness in there somewhere, but this is a worthless film deserving of no praise from anyone. The people who made this should be ashamed of themselves.Michael Trucco, you're better than this.",

After having seen The Bye Bye Man, I am now convinced that also the opposite is true: some of these bad reviews must have been written by competitors trying to steer viewers away from this solid film toward their own teams' efforts.My rating of 8 is probably biased upward because I personally love the overlap of psychological and supernatural in my horror. Probably it only really deserves a 6 or 7, but the concepts and execution are leagues better than most of the films of this genre that make it to the theater, and certainly better than at least 80% of the horror on Netflix.I'd been wanting to see The Bye Bye Man ever since the previews came out. It looked interesting, as previews often do, but of course we've all seen previews that make the film look way better than it ends up being. Especially as a horror fan, I have developed the ability to control my excitement and be ready for intriguing looking films to be awful. The Bye Bye Man far surpassed my moderate expectations. Of course it's not perfect. (How many perfect films have you honestly ever seen?) There were a few bits I rolled my eyes at. But it's still easily one of the best horror films I've seen in the past five years.Maybe people are forgetting what horror means. Maybe they want nonstop blood, guts and boobs.If you are a fan of actual horror, at least give this one a try. It's obviously not going to be for everyone.

Turns out there is a bogeyman called the Bye Bye Man and, once you speak or even think his name, he will turn up with his huge bad-CGI dog and mess with your head and people will die. The trick is to kill them and yourself before anyone else learns his name. Or before they write it on a piece of furniture in the house you're renting.Candyman did this, of course, years ago, with minor differences. No mirrors are involved here, and you only have to think the name, which explains people endlessly saying \"Don't think it, don't say it\" and endlessly writing same on walls, furniture, curtains etc. Though this doesn't explain writing the name in full on the bottom of a shelf first and then not crossing it out.So remember, kids, don't just throw that nightstand into the woods, make sure you burn it first.The three youngsters are all fine, and are mostly believable as they try to find a way to thwart the hooded Bye Bye Man and his flayed-bulldog-looking pet, which gnaws contentedly on the corpses of your friends after you've killed them.In truth, the Bye Bye Man's modus operandum is lacking a few bits of essential explanation - does he actually kill you? Or just fool you into killing others? Do you only kill people who have heard his name? - and also has some illogicality about it - if everyone gets killed then how is his name going to be disseminated so that he will have other to kill? He needs a bit more mythology in place before he makes his second outing, methinks,My comments might be somewhat disparaging, but this film succeeds fairly well, albeit it draws heavily on Candyman and the more recent It Follows in creating the same sort of dread. The idea of a horrible but unavoidable fate which follows inexorably gives you immense sympathy for the protagonists: you hope they find a solution. The fact that it happens once you have innocently stepped over a line which you didn't even know was there means that you howl at the unfairness of it.Faye Dunaway cameos: I wondered who it was.

The idea was neat. Not revolutionary if you have seen the Boogie Man movies. While Boogie Man had much better cinematography, for some odd reason I found The Bye Bye Man to be much less boring. It could be because of the mediocre acting that made me role my eyes once in a while. The lead actor was not bad, but the girl and the black guy went on my nerves. The story was good. The cinematography and acting were mediocre. The story kept my attention and I managed to sit through the whole thing and not regret watching it. What sent chills down my spine was not the jump scares (which didn't even work for me) but the one thing the lead actor told the female police officer \"You really think the truth, honesty is the best policy?\" and also when I was asking myself whether or not the little girl was going to say the name of the Bye Bye Man and start the cycle all over again. The twist at the end of the movie was rather good. I honestly didn't see that coming. I think this is worth watching once and it was better and less boring than some horror titles I've seen recently, even though the title of the movie might suggest that it's going to be garbage, which it isn't.

This is an above average movie that is well directed and has good actors. The cinematography was nicely done, as well. Although seeing Faye Dunaway, a long time crush, the way she looks now, was more horrifying than most of the film. The main bad guy (I'm not saying his name) was shown in too much light to be an effective boogie man and the computer generated dog should have been left out. Given all it flaws though, it's a nicely produced movie that isn't a 'mockumentary' and was an entertaining, not too demanding Horror romp. Always love seeing Carrie-Ann Moss, too.",

Douglas smith as Elliot was probably the worst actor, especially one certain scene.There's a shot gun scene, two people shot, zero blood, or even good acting as the victims were shot. It looked more like improv class, and the act was drop like you've been shot by a shotgun.The entire \"don't think it don't say it\" and he won't get you is like don't think or dreamnor Freddy Kruger and he can't kill you.

Five minutes into the movie i was very confused; it looks like a parody, the concept is very silly but they took it way too seriously and it was poorly, poorly executed.I think the story made no sense whatsoever, they set up this urban legened-type character, but they gave him no backstory and no real purpose. You say his name, he comes for you, but he doesn't kill you, he just... makes you see things? And you kill yourself? And what's with the coins and the train? And the awful CGI dog? I believe the filmakers wanted to start this urban legend where people would spread their theories around the internet and such, but they fail to make it interesting or scary enough.Also the acting is embarrasing, the editing is amateurish and the directing feels rushed and sloppy, like the director wanted to make this as quickly as possible and the editor tried to make a coherent product but he also failed.But i would be lying if say i didn't have a good time, it's an interesting experience, it's kinda amusing to watch and be constantly asking yourself if they were serious about the decisions the makers of the movie made.

For whoever cares it's about these college students moving into an old abandoned house where they stumble upon the spooky legend of the Bye Bye Man, that I think does something like manipulates people's minds until they walk into their own deaths, a bit like Final Destination. What can be said about this inept movie is that it's almost as friggin silly as it's title is, a lot of it is just repetitive going back and forth crap in regards to the daft rules of the Man, but in the end that doesn't mean very much when you've got an overall experience that's as unremarkable as this one is. It runs for the standard hour and a half but my goodness it felt like a chore to sit through, it's nonsensical, poorly acted, especially from the main girl who's putting on an American accent but she can't keep it together for damn one minute because she's so obviously British. That's a little funny at times but it's not enough to make it a passable movie at all. There's terrible cgi effects and wasted acting opportunities from people who I like and know can act like Faye Dunaway and even the wonderful Doug Jones seems to not really be giving his monstery all here, the movie is a mess that is so very forgettable I'm pretty sure I was forgetting it while I was still watching it the one time only that I did, super-unmemorable and just very dull and weak. Don't bother, who ever would want too lol, films like this are highly produced chaff, I frequently watch dirt cheap indie horror movies with tons more charm and enjoyably to them.

I'm sorry to break it to the director. But loud noises do not make a horror film. There so many plot holes, like the train. I still have no idea why there was a reoccurring train. Also how did the bye bye man came to be? Did he just pop up one day out of nowhere? What was the significance of the coins?Some of the acting literally had me laugh out loud. The editing did not help with that either. Honestly, if you're looking for a comedy to watch, i may have just found it.So in conclusion, if you want to keep your faith in good movies, do not watch this one. It will scar you for life.

This was not one of them.So you already know what the flimsy story line is, so I will just comment on it. There is no explanation of what this entity, or his very poorly computer generated demon dog, is or how they came to be. The guy himself does have a certain air of menace but he doesn't really do much. The acting of just about everyone is sub-high school play. I mean really, did they pick up these people at Walmart, give them $20 and ask them to be in a movie? In all fairness, the movie did have some OK moments they would have been better with better actors and perhaps a director who took some time to flesh out the story. It just seemed almost like random events tied together by this very silly named entity. And I got really tired of the heavily repeated \"Don't think it, don't say it\" nonsense. I did like the cameo by Faye Dunaway and was surprised she was in this sub-par cinema, but she is in her sunset years so a little frivolous role is acceptable.And when the anti-climactic ending came and the credits started, I then saw why this may have been a crock. 'Screenplay by Jonathan Penner'. Really, the guy who was a Survivor contestant? I thought that was him earlier in the movie, he has a very distinctive voice. But I guess if you appear on Survivor you can suddenly be a screenwriter. But then I see his occasional credits extend before Survivor, though I don't recall that ever coming up during his time on that show.And sure, the movie did well at the box office opening weekend, but it's only because they played their cards right. It opened on Friday the 13th and there really weren't any other scary movies out there. So hooray for them for good game play but I expect this will drop like a stone during subsequent weekends. The movie may be OK for younger kids (and trust me, there were lots of obnoxious little monsters in the theater we were in who wouldn't shut up) who don't necessarily need a story line to follow and just like a modest jump now and then, but for anyone looking for an ounce of substance, look elsewhere.

It wasn't anything special, but it made the movie look interesting, creepy atmosphere, creepy visuals, and the creepy view of one of the lead characters eyes rolling back in his head as he seemed to be possessed (which was a lie and never occurred in the movie). We sat in the theater and the movie began. Almost immediately I noticed how horrific the acting and the way they presented the \"spooky\" atmosphere was. After spending far too long getting to know everyone and why they are in the movie, the \"scary\" bit began. I say scary very loosely as throughout the movie, I felt no sense of fear or tension. Most of the scares that I noticed were jump scares meant to get a cheap reaction out of you. There was only one jump that was at least a little creative, involving a character who wakes up after seeing \"the bye bye man\" and it catches you off guard because it takes A few seconds too long to actually jump, putting you off guard. Other than that however, there was nothing that scared me in a \"real\" way. The ending stunk as it acted as if it felt like the movie to this point was a joke. It uses cheap excuses to kill off characters and people don't follow normal human behavior. Over all it was a miserable experience and would not recommend.",

People like this are just out of their minds trying to persuade others to not take their own opinions and watching it themselves to find out if it good or not.Yes, as I have said it starts kind of slow, but once it kicks in, it is very fast paced and good. One of the best PG-13 horror movies. I did not notice the F words that IMDb says it contains in the PG-13 version. I never saw the unrated one. I think they messed it up saying that the PG-13 has 6 F-words in it. I think it is the unrated one has it, and saying that makes me want to buy the unrated one on Blu-Ray.Don't Think It, Don't Say It! Over and over again. Kind of like Candy Man movie, without saying it three or five times to bring the horror. I am the horror buff that loves R and Unrated over PG-13 but this has to one PG-13 movie I would watch if they put it on television. I would buy the Blu-Ray unrated in a heartbeat when I have the money. The bad reviews are just bad people that don't what hit them.I can't stand people that give good movies a bad rap. They need the bad rap about their stupid reviews. So, do not listen to the crap reviews and listen to our great reviews.",

As it stands they both have ratings near 3/4 out of 10 on IMDb. They're at least somewhat creepy with certain bits of ominous imagery and I would honestly consider them middle of the road to decent gateway horror films. I would definitely at least give them a lower 6 out of 10. And the critique for both films is never in depth or logical. All I ever see is \"garbage trash dumpster fire not scary\" almost in carbon copy fashion. I mean at least if you're going to rip something apart and call\nIt the worst thing of all time give me some actual plausible reasons to believe your extreme statement. I think this generation is suffering from a huge problem with extreme love or hate opinions and just overall behavior in general. All I know is that I would rather watch the bye-bye man or slender man over a pseudo-intellectual artsy ineffective convoluted mess that is a24 horror. Films like hereditary the witch it comes at night that I don't even consider true horror but more of dull slow scam dramas.

The weird demon dog? Why is the Bye Bye Man so completely not scary looking?The reveals are unsurprising. The acting is atrocious, and the character relationships feel thin and forced. The entire plot line with the librarian is unnecessary, and drags down the film in an almost tangible way. There is so much wrong with this film that I am actually baffled. I don't know how they managed to make this film feel so bland without it being intentional.It's been a long time since I've had such a bland horror experience in theaters.

This movie left me very tense most of the way through (the 3rd act always slows down a bit). It's very creepy and eerie. Most people's complaints were pertaining to a lack of backstory on the Bye Bye Man. This is an unfortunate side effect of being raised in the millennial generation and the newest generation. Everything needs to be explained and handed on a silver platter. Some of the scariest, creepiest things are often left unknown. It's the unknown that is scary/interesting. It's with all horror movie franchises. They give more and more of the origin until everything is overexplained and dull. Michael Myers was scary because he went around killing people and we didn't know why. Then Rob Zombie goes and explains how it all came to be and ruins it. Was his version scary? A big fat no. It makes me think of the episode of Doug where he can't finish watching a horror movie cause he gets too scared. It's this creature that you never see, only a shadow and you hear it. Finally he sees it and laughs at how ridiculous it is. The unknown is scary. See the movie for yourself.

I really don't understand what people were thinking when making this movie. It's like watching a really strange dream with weird acting and dialogue, and no well thought out plot - a weird dream I would have, on rare occasions. The acting was straight up laughable - I couldn't understand any of the characters. It was so obvious the actors were reading off a script, and some of them didn't put any thought into it.The story, too, didn't have any thought put into it. There was no backstory for The Bye Bye Man. We're given an opening scene during the 1960's or so where a man asks others if they told anyone of \"the name\", which obviously refers to \"The Bye Bye Man\", and they said they shared it with others, which results in the man killing these people. The name is basically a virus, and in order to get rid of it is to commit suicide or homicide. This is the only 'backstory' given to us.I recommend maybe watching this on Netflix(if it gets released on there) or on other streaming services.

A fear that goes on and on and on.Also, a plus, is that instead of making everything incoherent and shaking and annoyingly dark, we can actually see what's going on. It's a fault that made me drop tons of horror movies- a fault this movie DIDNT make. Yeah, the acting isn't perfect, but it's far less than bad.\nYeah, the plot isn't mind boggling nor amazing, but it's far less than bad.Also a plus, I really loved how they tried to mingle with a bit of philosophy there. In the library scene. \"If we erase any evidence, it's like it never existed.\". Someone there read 1984 (; Anyways, I recommend it. It's a gem in my opinion.

I love how the ending is set up for a sequel but I personally can't imagine what they'd do for a second movie except for a retelling of the story with different deaths. Douglas Smith rocked his role as Elliot. Of course everyone was awesome but with Douglas Smith being the lead role he had more screen time and in return, majority of the audience attention.

The Bye Bye man could have focused more on the antagonist and given much more life to the myth. This just might have put that little bit of edge on the film, which is so desperately needed.The good news is that the film doesn't lag like a lot of horror films when they have to drag out the suspense or heavily build up the character development.There are quite a few clich\u00e9 moments in the film. And many moments make you cringe out of the sheer stupidity of the characters. A girl runs in front of an oncoming train as if she is completely oblivious to the sirens, flashing lights, and her general well-being. A woman stands in the middle of the road in the dead of night as if she is also oblivious to any oncoming traffic and gets run over by a car. You get my point.I'll be straight out honest, and say the prologue could have been done much, much better. If you think the opening will grip you and pull you into the story then you are wrong. It's a bit corny, and not the least bit absorbing. I felt that it was funny rather than its intention of being serious or shocking.The Bye Bye Man (Doug Jones) was a sinister-looking character and I just wish they did more with him. I wanted to know more about his origins and just think that he should have been utilized a whole lot better. His hound, however, was so blatantly CGI that it was not nearly as effective or intimidating.The s\u00e9ance in the film was completely random and not needed. The coins were a nice touch but had very little connection to the Bye Bye man other than you are meant to be aware that he is near or coming for you.People who have either said his name, hear his name, or even thought about him are vulnerable to having vivid, troublesome hallucinations. It seems the Bye Bye man doesn't actually kill anyone physically but instead gets into people's minds to make them commit these horrendous acts.The acting was fairly below average. I would say except for Elliot (Douglas Smith) who was the only one I felt had somewhat of a decent, or interesting personality.The Bye Bye man won't go down to win any awards. It's fun enough for a bit of laughter and light-hearted entertainment. But it's not scary and it is very predictable. There was one little twist near the end which was quite unexpected but you don't care enough for it to impact you. While the ending of the film itself was just bland and insipid.5/10.",

I didn't have any expectations of 'The Bye Bye Man' and expected it to be another one I'd add to the average and forgettable, or damn right awful, pile, but I really enjoyed it.The concept of 'The Bye Bye Man' is interesting, the atmosphere is eerie and suspenseful, the plot is engaging throughout and there's multiple decent jump scares. How the Bye Bye Man is incorporated into the story means you never quite know what's real and what's not, which builds the suspense a lot.I've seen another reviewers make comparisons to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and 'It Follows' and I have to agree. The concept of The Bye Bye Man is similar to the entity in 'It Follows' and the idea that there's an evil that attaches itself to you and is devoted to killing you mirrors both 'It Follows' and 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. Despite sharing similarities with other films in the genre, it's quite an original concept and isn't your typical slasher horror nor your typical supernatural horror.The only element of the film that lets it down is the acting. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not good either. I'd describe it as mediocre. This means that the characters themselves feel very one-dimensional and lack in any real personality, but that's a common trait of a lot of horrors, and it's not so bad that it ruins the enjoyment of the film.Overall, 'The Bye Bye Man' is an enjoyable viewing experience and definitely worth more than a 4 star rating. With a different cast I believe it could've been as popular and well-received as 'It Follows' (personally, I prefer 'The Bye Bye Man' to 'It Follows') because it has all of the other elements there to be a horror classic. My advice would be don't be deterred from watching based on the bad reviews and ratings, because they're misleading. On the same token, don't go in with high expectations, just enjoy it for what it is.",

It's almost seems like a parody of these wussy PG-13 money-grubbing horror movies that have been released in the last few years, but sadly it takes itself way to seriously to be a parody.The acting is absolutely terrible from all the main characters and it's actually pretty hilarious at some points. The effects are also just as bad, seriously the dog looks like it belongs in the first Resident Evil game, and the main villain isn't intimidating at all. And as usual in horror films, the teens are all complete idiots that constantly do stupid things to move the plot forward. Like why would you put a hammer that you're going to use to kill someone in plain view of said person WITH FREAKING BLOOD STILL ON IT!!??! The scares were all extremely predictable and cheap jump scares that aren't even scary because the The Bye Bye Man looks like he belongs in a retirement home.It's obvious this movie got a lot cut from it when it was downgraded to PG-13. The movie constantly brings up trains in relation to the villain but never explains its significance. Not to mention the three random naked people on the train tracks that aren't ever mentioned again. But anyway this movie is a passable piece of garbage that isn't scary in the slightest, do yourself a favor and save that hard earned cash for something actually good. Hopefully once the studios realize these PG-13 crapfests don't sell, we'll get some quality R horror films to replace this trash.",

The first weird part is that among all this abhorrent work, Douglas Smith actually does a really good job! The other weird part is how the script continually goes from mind blowing stupidity, to way above average in seconds. Sometimes you want more, some times you just wanna turn it off. Also, often times, movies like this start off great or at least okay, and then just nosedive around the 45-minute mark. This one does the opposite, it starts off absolutely terrible and then gets better and better, albeit somewhat schizophrenically, with every passing minute.So yeah, don't expect a masterpiece, don't even expect a good horror film, expect the kind of film you would have loved if you saw it as a 13 year old with your best friend Saturday night in your parents basement, and you will be decently entertained as an adult.",

Everything about it is just plain bad, from the acting, to the plot, to the effects, and especially the scariness. But what truly launches it into so-bad-it's-good territory is how weirdly pretentious it all is.Here are a few standout scenes that really showcase the awfulness of this movie.One of the first scenes in the film is of our incredibly boring main character, Elliot, discovering the words \"don't think it, don't say it\" carved onto a nightstand. When he turns it over, he sees the name of the titular villain. Now, one of the most important plot points in the movie is that after reporting on a case of a teenager killing his family (allegedly because the Bye Bye Man told him to do so), the previous owner of the protagonist's house did everything in his power to erase the Bye Bye Man from existence. He literally committed mass murder on a bunch of his neighbors just for this purpose. But, apparently, he was so lazy he couldn't even be bothered to check around his house to see if he left the name anywhere. Honestly, it's all so entirely contrived that it is quite hilarious.Later, Elliot investigates the Bye Bye Man further, and eventually comes upon a dossier about him in his local library. Again, I must point out how incredibly, impossibly stupid this reporter was. Honestly, you didn't even bother to get rid of all copies of your article before going on a bloody rampage? Really?And we come to one of the final scenes in the movie, which is also hands down the most ridiculous. As you might expect, the Bye Bye Man comes to kill Elliot, but just before he does so, Elliot proclaims his love for the Bye Bye Man. I mean, do I even need to explain the problem with this? The film has suffocated itself with its own self-importance so much, that it barely makes sense anymore. Forget Elliot; the film itself has lost its mind.Oh, but that's not the end of the stupidity, as the film manages to pack in one final, dumb punch. Basically, the house is burned to the ground, but one of Elliot's roommates who was witness to a bunch of Bye Bye Man stuff lives. As he's being taken out of the building on a stretcher, the investigator working on the case asks him the name of the person that caused all of this. And the roommate just... tells her. Again, the dumbness of this should speak for itself, but I'll spell it out anyway. Despite all the murders he's witnessed, the chaos he's endured, the madness he's experienced, he still gives up the name to the investigator for literally no reason. What's the matter with these people? Erasing a name from existence in the laziest way possible? Falling in love with a supernatural murderer? Purposefully condemning at least one more person to death for no reason?The Bye Bye Man is a stain on the careers of all involved. I don't know how Trinity from the Matrix and Faye Dunaway got roped into this catastrophe, but they certainly couldn't have appeared in anything worse than this. Unless you're looking for a hilarious comedy, avoid this film.Final Score: 20/100.",

It just references a myth, but it never explains the origin of said myth: who is the Bye Bye Man? What is his beef with (these) people? What's with the dog? What's with the trains? It does not go beyond \"A guy that murders people that say his name, and his pet (and there are also trains I guess)\", which in turn makes it generic. This is probably the result of poor story conversion, as there is an actual backstory that would have made this so much more gruesome than it was.It also lacks interesting characters, and to an extent a good cast. Doug Jones was amazing as the titular character, I'll give them that. Virgil and Hat Girl were OK. Elliot wasn't awful; properly scared, and it was definitely a step up from Smith's role in Ouija. But the rest did not deliver. In particular Sasha was played by someone who is obviously a model and not really an actor.Furthermore, it suffered from pretty poor editing; a lot of scenes ended abruptly, even when they show something that gets referenced later, which makes you lose focus and as a result confuses you. The main plotline has quite some holes and situations that simply make no sense, even if you caught all the important details.On a positive note, it was quite entertaining, be it more in a fun way than in an actual scary way. It is not the worst thing to watch, but just had too much potential wasted to be actually good.Rating: 4.5/10.",

            "content": "The movie begins strong and was legitimately creepy, but once the weirdness kicks in it starts to fall apart.The biggest problem with The Bye Bye Man (besides the absurd title) are the uneven performances from Douglas Smith and Cressida Bonas. While Smith is somewhat reliable in this role but he delves into hammy waters often enough that it becomes hard to take him seriously. Bonas, on the other hand, is almost never believable and her delivery is almost universally terrible. It makes me wonder how a director can watch a performance as bad as hers and consider it to be acceptable.This is particularly jarring when compared to the performances of Lucien Laviscount and Jenna Kanell. Kanell's part is comparatively smaller than Bonas's, but the quality of her acting is so markedly better that one cannot help bu think their roles should have been switched. Laviscount seems to be a reliably effective actor, conveying genuine emotions where Smith is more hit or miss. The discrepancy between the male actors is not quite as pronounced,, however.The movie also should have been a bit longer. They characters seem to jump to conclusions not based on their experience within the film, but rather because the plot demands it. Better writing would have helped as well.In the end we have a mediocre horror film that occasionally shows what could have been if only a few small changes had been made.",

The story and plot elements had a lot of good potential, and there were genuinely good plot twists near the end. And kudos for not making the title character just a cheap cgi monster, and we instead get a nice makeup job. Certainly not the scariest of boogeymen, but definitely unique. The flaws mostly exist in the characters and performances, particularly the lead actress, who does her best I'm sure, but just doesn't quite sell it. The way the characters are portrayed and the cheesy dialogue is at times impossible to get behind, but this is to be expected in a movie like this. No, this isn't a major horror masterpiece. It's a decent thriller that makes an excellent time killer. Just go with it, and enjoy the ride. You could do so much worse than The Bye Bye Man-- Wes Wall.",

Plot is simple, yet some things have been left vague. I'm guessing it's due to budget restraints or because the team behind this was afraid that audience wouldn't appreciate detailed backstory to the creature. In all honesty, leaving it up to thin air made the movie creepier for me, since the monster lacked the fear factory in appearance. It was just plain weird.I wasn't aware that there was a real legend behind this before I came to IMDB. Had the team written it in, I think it would have made the creature too much human.With all the flaws in it the movie managed to entertain me, even puzzle me momentarily, and as a fan of 80's slashers I would recommend this to anybody who's still watching Freddy, Jason and Michael butchering teenagers.

It's so bland that trying to guess the tone is impossible, it's not serious because of all the dumb, unintentionally hilarious moments like when this guy in the opening shoots all these people.Bad Things:It sounds scary enough, but what ruins it is 1) It's shot during the day, so all hope at a scary setting is lost, if it was shot during a sunset or at night, then it would be forgiven. 2) The whole thing is shot in one take, so the already mediocre actors look even worse at their job. If they just shot the scene normally the whole scene would look and be acted more competently. 3) The writing is awful, so even if they did all the things I suggested, the scene would still be bad.The effects look like a TV show or something, I don't know what the budget was, but this got released in theaters and it looks like a TV miniseries or something. If you were to come across this on Netflix, it would fit right in, you would think this was another cheap Netflix horror movie, that's the level of quality were talking about. Especially the dog thing, it looked like a PlayStation game.The acting is pretty bad, it's not the actors fault, the garbage script they were given didn't really help them.It has a lot horror clich\u00e9s like jumpscares, psychic goth girl, seance and magic thing that really works, scary library scene, claims to be based on a true story and so forth.Good Things:The idea is good, I think the idea of an entity that spreads through thinking about him and knowing his name is pretty scary, they should have chosen a scarier name than the Bye Bye Man though.While the acting is bad, there is one scene with Trinity from the Matrix (I don't the actors name) and this one guy who looks like Dane Dahan where the acting and writing are pretty solid. I really like that scene. I think the Dane Dahan guy can be a good actor when he's given good material and good direction and I guess that scene they accidentally got good acting.While all the digital effects are bad, the practical effects are solid.Overall, I think if the idea was given to a more competent person, this could have been a decent horror movie.",

            "content": "I can say with the upmost confidence that The Bye Bye Man is a movie I will remember for a long time for all the wrong reasons. This is easily one of the worst horror films I've seen in a long time. As I type this review, my head is still spinning from the sheer stupidity I've witnessed. If you notice terrible grammar and poor sentence structure in this review, it's most likely due to the amount of brain cells this movie extracted from me. The film is about three teenagers who've recently purchased a creepy old house that Elvis Presley would sing about in his song \"In the Ghetto\". When our protagonist finds a nightstand with \"The Bye Bye Man\" sketched on the inside, paranormal occurrences begin to happen all over the house. Basically if anyone says or thinks \"The Bye Bye Man\", he and his poorly rendered CGI Rottweiler will kill them. I realize that was a terrible synopsis, but it was a terrible movie and I just want to tear it apart now. The acting in this film is absolutely dreadful. All of the written dialogue and onscreen chemistry resembled a film you would see on the sci-fi channel on Tuesday night. The plot is equally terrible if not worse. For example, there's a scene where the main character wants to research the bye bye man to find out what exactly he is. Well since the film takes place in 2017, he naturally goes to the library.....the library. There is literally a shot earlier in the film displaying an iMac. Apparently the film wants to be set in the 50s. There's also a recurring nuisance in which the characters say exactly what they're thinking while they're performing an action. And by \"recurring\" I mean literally all the time. I also think it goes without saying that we never learn anything about the bye bye man. His story, motive, high school years, favorite ice cream flavor at Ben & Jerry's, none of it is revealed. On the bright side, the terrible acting, scares, and effects can be so terrible that they're laughable. If you ever find yourself hanging out with a bunch of friends and you're in the mood to just ridicule a god awful film, this is definitely one to check out. But if you're looking for any other reason to watch it, the best advice I can give is don't see it, don't think it.",

These types of movies seldom give the actors anything they can really sink their teeth into.The girlfriend played by Cressida Bonas, this was her debut and really, what could she do with the part she was given? It's basically a walk through just be yourself role. There was no challenge to it.It's been said that a good screenplay brings out the best in A+ actors, A+ actors can take an average screenplay and make it seem better than it actually is because of their talent, but a bad screenplay will make even the best actors look bad.If you're a fan of horror it's watchable. If you're going to watch it like a movie critic you'll be disappointed. Movies regardless of genre are subjective. What one likes another will dislike.For example, I know people that absolutely love Sharknado. I think it's so stupid that I won't waste one second of time time watching it.",

            "content": "First of all: I've seen far worse movies than this one. Giving it 1 star would just not do the other movies justice. Yes, the actors aren't good, the story is pretty weird at times (read on!), the whole movie isn't played out great. Still it has a creepy atmosphere, most viewers may relate to the characters' emotions. In general it's your average horror flick to watch with easily creeped friends. You should just not think about it too much.The biggest failure of the movie is that it had a great back story and missed to implement the main plot:\nIt just never tells you who the bye bye man is! It rather tries to create another \"Candyman\" while it would be so much better sticking to it's origin \"the bridge to body Island'.Spoilers!The actual back story is about a man who gets scorned and tormented so much, he seeks revenge, which then it turns him into a serial killer who travels through the states by train rather than being a \"hallucination\" that no one but Elliott, who has visions of trains for no good reason, can see.The dog is actually called \"Gloomsinger\", and was sewed together by the bye bye man himself to help him track his victims after turning blind himself. It needs dead bodies or it will decay. The bye bye man has no intention of turning students mad so they start killing each other. Also, why is not a single person in the movie questioning the dog who eats dead bodies?!The bye bye man is said to be pale (albino) with long hair, tattooed and wearing glasses and a hat. He's carrying a sack of organs. So it's not that bald funny dude in a scream-costume that can be seen in this movie. Also, why is no one in the movie ever mentioning that robe standing in their bedroom, turning into a vision of a hallucination of the bye bye man.Also, why do the characters never talk about their hallucinations but beat around the bush, taking about the bye bye man all the time without actually figuring out anything (like his dog, the train, the coins?) at all.The writer of the bye bye man may have misunderstood or just glanced over the original story or, and we know that's more likely, did change the plot in purpose, knowing that pseudo mythical events do buzz on most algorithms these days.\nThe original story of the bye bye man would have ended in plain old slasher movie.\nBut most of us would have loved to see that slasher movie!",

            "content": "I just saw The Bye Bye Man this past weekend and all I have to say is this had potential to be fairly solid but fails in almost every aspect. I went in not knowing much about this film, and I left with a lot of opinions to say the least. Let's organize this with pros and cons, because I just like to be organized.Pros:-There are some creepy moments to the film. It's nice to see a new horror/thriller use some suspense for once.-The Bye Bye Man has a ridiculous sounding name, but is a cool looking character. Props to the costume designers for that one.-A few performances were actually pretty solid, the guys who play the Bye Bye Man, Elliot, and John all do a consistently solid job.-It's obviously trying to be something along the lines of Slender and A Nightmare on Elm Street, which I think is interesting enough. I love classic horror, and The Bye Bye Man gave me feelings of not just Emperor Palpatine, but Freddy Kruger as well. He's an entity that doesn't really exist but is claiming victims through their minds.Cons:-Anything with significance is left completely unexplained. I left the theater with a lot of unanswered questions. Where does the Bye Bye Man originate from? Who the hell is the Bye Bye Man? Why does the Bye Bye Man have a dog or hellhound type thing? Why is a nightstand the most significant thing about this entity? What do these coins that keep dropping everywhere have to do with anything?-The film is only 96 minutes long, which I felt could have totally used another 15 minutes to just explain some things.-Although I was pleasantly surprised at the beginning with the suspense, it gives up on any suspense after the first half hour or so and relies heavily on jumpscares the rest of the way through to get any sort of audience reaction.-The Bye Bye Man's dog/hellhound type thing should have just been scratched on the whole. There's no explanation as to why it's there and the CGI is laughably bad.-Besides the characters I listed in the pros, the rest of the acting performances are kinda meh.-The film loses all of it's tension after a bit. Eventually I found myself laughing more than being scared.-The premise is kinda...meh. Doesn't make a lot of sense because you're not supposed to say or think his name, but how do you not THINK it? There's no real plot twist or anything to make the story interesting, the ending is a little flat and overall just didn't step out of any boundaries to be original. Basically meaning the whole movie is full of clich\u00e9s.-Severe lack of transition. Remember when I said it could've used an extra 15 minutes to explain things? Tack on some establishing shots to that extra time. Scenes jump from one to another with no transition which makes the first half of the film retardedly confusing. We were a half hour in and nobody had any idea what was going on.-This was CLEARLY watered down last minute to try and fit a larger audience, nearly being rated R but released PG-13. There's a flashback in the beginning where people are getting blasted with a shotgun but there's zero blood to be found. It should have taken the chance with an R rating instead of trying to hang on to PG-13 guidelines, which probably explains why there's nothing that steps outside of the boundaries for originality.So, yes, The Bye Bye Man should have just been a straight to Netflix thing. Anybody who liked it in any sense can't give it more than a 6. I had to give it a 4, it's nice to get a refreshment of classic horror but the negatives greatly outweigh the positives. Would I watch a sequel? If it's done right and explains some origin or backstory maybe. It had the potential to be solid on the whole, but it never really makes an effort to go anywhere outside of it's comfort zone, or even explain anything that's significant to the story, not even the title character for Pete's sake.",

From the makers of the instant classic Oculus: Devil's Mirror movie, this masterpiece seems to enact once again plot twists worth the wondering.

This entire movie is tainted by this, and removes any possibility of viewers remembering it with anything other than laughter.While this movie is conceptually decent, it fails to deliver over and over again as the 'plot' unfolds. What seems like a concept with a lot of potential for tension and lore ends up being a badly executed version of something we've seen over and over again, 'demon causes spooky hallucinations before driving its victims over the edge'. The movie seemed like it was going to give some sort of exposition or explanation of the villain, but ended up giving absolutely nothing other than what we learn from the trailer.The acting has one or two moments that pleasantly surprised me, but for the most part it was either lifeless, over the top, or just strange. If there were any reason to suggest watching this it would be so that you can witness the trip that is the acting in this movie.The movie looked good, and, with the exception of a terrible CGI dog that played no significant role, the villain and the scares were probably the most entertaining part of this movie. Doug Jones portrays the awfully named antagonist with an air of originality, and looked great while doing it.If you want to see what the fuss is about, be my guest. But don't say I didn't warn you.",

All we know about the character of \"The Bye-Bye Man\" is the repeated ad nauseum mantra \"Don't think it, Don't say it,\" but that's it. Apparently, it leads to your death, and the only way to get rid of him is to remove any mention of him anywhere. However, the only people who die are killed by other characters trying to remove any trace of the supposed villain. And in the end, when the villain actually has a chance to deliver some form of payoff...\nHe does nothing. \nNothing in this film is engaging. The colors are muted, the camera work is sloppy, the special effects are not effective. But on top of it all, it's not fun. I love movies that are so bad they cross the threshold into good souly based on how much fun they are to watch. This movie doesn't even dip a toe in the waters of fun.

And there were a lot of scenes in the film where there was nothing happening and I don't mean in the \"wow this is so suspenseful\" way the cgi and practical effects looked pretty bad to me and my family on our viewing of the film. The bye bye man is like Jason Voorhees if Jason couldn't use his machete and just stood there ominously with the power to make poeple see things and nothing else and with the bad effects mixing with this the bye bye man is almost comical. Now for the characters there all so ridiculously dumb they literally go into every trick head first and fail to come to obvious conclusions until it's to late. The acting is one of the worst parts of this really bad movie sasha's acting was particularly uninjoyable the only performance that I found tolerable was that of the character vigil. And on top of all of that I felt like there was this weird allegory for mental illness (like schizophrenia) and they even reference columbine while talking about the MC Elliot at the end like tf. Now for a personal gripe I don't how if it's just a problem with my TV but I could hardly hear anything unless it was a unscary Jumpscare and I turned it up to like 70 and ended up just turning on subtitles.

            "content": "This film The Bye Bye Man was directed by a Stacy Title one of many female directors in the film industry. She is known for her films Let the Devil Wear Black, Last Supper and Down on the Waterfront. The Bye Bye Man seems to be Stacy's first horror film. \"When three college students move into an old house off campus, they unwittingly unleash a supernatural entity known as The Bye Bye Man, who comes to prey upon them once they discover his name. The friends must try to save each other, all the while keeping The Bye Bye Man's existence a secret to save others from the same deadly fate.\".\nThe Bye Bye Man consisted of many different symbols that constantly occurred. Some symbols that occurred in this film were a coin and trains. All these things in the film that essentially brought upon the demon/evil spirit. The coin could be a symbol of having two different sides of you. It could also symbolize taking chances because like everyone does as you \"flip a coin\". Trains where a constant symbol in this film because the train would be something those who knew the Bye Bye Man's name would see trains in their sleep. This symbolized the that he was coming The Bye Bye Man was coming for you like a train just chugging along looking for his next stop/victim.\nA major motif that I found in this film that occurs in many other horror films were the steps or signs of this demon or monster. In The Bye Bye Man, some signs that the Bye Bye Man was coming/haunting coin flip, trains, dreams, the dog, hallucinations, \"don't say it don't think it\", psychic, and Ouija board. In this film, the main characters Elliot (Douglas Smith), Sasha (Cressida Bonas) and John (Lucien Laviscount) moved into this house on near their college campus. Once settled Sasha began to hear the sound of a coin flipping and doors slamming shut by itself. She was later told that the sound of the coin flip means that the Bye Bye Man is coming. The trains like mentioned before were another sign that the Bye Bye Man was coming because you see it in your dreams. Then that is another sign you start having weird dreams that just keep getting realer and realer every time. When finding out the history of house and Bye Bye man the students were told that if you hear or see the dog the Bye Bye man is also near the dog is the Bye Bye Mans evil side kick. Hallucinations is another motif that occurs in this film the Bye Bye Man starts to get in the student's heads and makes them see things that aren't real and going after what their weakness. There is a saying in this film that is repeated \"don't say it don't think it\" which is how you somewhat control the Bye Bye Man haunting you. A major motif that appears in this film is a psychic and use of Ouija board these two things are known for antagonizing the evil, awakening the evil and making the evil stronger. Many films like Nightmare on Elm Street, Babadook, Conjuring, and many more. All these films talk about signs and how the evil entity will appear and haunt you. For example, in the Babadook the story explains how the Babadook would haunt you. In the Conjuring the \"demon experts\" explained to the family the steps of how the demon attacks you and begins to possess you. The Bye Bye Man did the same it explained how the Bye Bye Man appears.\nThe Bye Bye Man was overall a decent film. It was good for it being somewhat of a low budget film. This films budget was approximately $7,400,000 this is kind of low budget for most films. The only thing that really bothered me about this film was the special effects. There were many parts of the film where the demons pet dog would be walking or eating people, and it looked super computerized. If I were to rate this film it would be a 6.6/10.",

To begin, it is troubling to see a film like this, with decent production value, end up being such a huge disappointment. The cinematography for this film wasn't groundbreaking but it can at least be considered 'solid'.As for the premise itself and the painfully unrealistic script, the same cannot be said.The Bye Bye Man is so devoid of anything that can be considered even remotely realistic. The plot is simple - which isn't necessarily a bad thing - but the plot points that fill out the storyline are just...dumb. The circumstances that motivate the characters to act are questionable in and of themselves and the responses that the characters have to their issues are boring and, once again, unrealistic.I can forgive a movie with wooden acting, stilted dialogue, and embarrassingly stereotypical characters if it is, at the very least, fun. Sadly, The Bye Bye Man is the farthest thing from fun. I will admit that I laughed at some of the serious parts of the movie, but not in an enjoyable way. Half of the time I found my eyes rolling into the back of my head because of corny dialogue or weird, unmotivated character actions.All in all, this film was just...not fun, not smart, not entertaining, and hardly original. If 2017 was the year when horror movies took a nosedive in artistic value, this was the film that helped to sink the ship.3/10 extremely generous stars...",

Stop me if this sounds familiar, but a supernatural murderer with extraordinary powers and a sneaky subtle way of getting to you places the \"trigger\" for its curse in a very convenient location that then spreads like the flu and claims lives slowly after a few days of psychological torture, ending with people turning on each other and one person finding out The Truth On How To Win thanks to the previous victim knowing part of The Truth On How To Win, only for it to not matter and for them to lose anyways. No? That's totally unique? If you say so. The actors look uncomfortable throughout the film, and not just as their characters. This film also carries that whole psychological trick where after you're done watching it you think, \"Oh man.. what if this happens to me?,\" and it succeeded in that department, which is the only reason it gets 1/5 instead of 0.5/5. The Bye Bye Man features a scathingly childish name which it could have turned into some creepy child-spread curse, but didn't because then it'd be too close to The Ring (as if it wasn't already). The development for the supernatural killer is nonexistent, we learn nothing about him, he's just The Guy That's There. The cliches are all here, too. Protagonist finds a creepy piece of paper that says spastically \"Don't think it don't say it\", then reads the name, and what does he do? Well of course, he runs off and tells as many people as he possibly can, even after his damn ghost-parents tell him not to. Ultimately the movie ends with stupidity. A librarian found run over, holding a bloody knife, and her kids have stab wounds? Clearly it was the guy that HIT her, not her, and is the girlfriend holding a pair of bloody scissors tightly in her hand? Well, woah, that's gotta be the main protagonist's fault that his best friend has scissor wounds, too. This movie follows no logical progression, and will leave you frustrated.",

The story makes me think that it is possibly be inspired to other horror movies like Candyman (1992) and Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) because of its similarity or likelihood to those films. I wished the film elaborated more background about The Bye Bye Man and not just about a link to its past as show in the movie. The film mainly focuses on the jump scare tropes and horror tension of the film while it suffered a no solution ending which was hard for some viewers to swallow.    \n\nBut on a good note, some other parts of its story still has originality like the concept of The Bye Bye Man itself.

Fast forward to the present, college students Elliot (Douglas Smith), Sasha (Cressida Bonas) who is very tasty , and John (Lucien Laviscount) move into an off-campus house. After they discover the name The Bye Bye Man, things start to go bump in the night and they feel a presence around them. The more they think about the name, the stronger the presence grows. So, they start hallucinating. Those hallucinations lead to distrust, misunderstandings, and irrational fear. \nFirst and foremost, I really liked the concept. The hallucinations aren't particularly frightening, but I thought they played out well. They help create a sense of doubt in every scene. The film was also paced well, never dragging its feet.

            "content": "Look, not every movie can be a winner.  I get that and I understand it.  Unlike the philosophy some Americans would have you believe, there's nothing wrong with coming in second or third place.  There really isn't.  There isn't anything wrong with placing fourth either.  There is a problem, however, if you're 150 out of 200 competitors.  I mean, really, there's nothing wrong with that either, but there's nothing to be proud about either.  Having said that, in most cases, if you're a professional athlete, then that lack of success might motivate you to work harder so that, next time out, you place higher and higher and higher.  But, unfortunately, when applying this to horror movies, it just doesn't work.  Once a movie has been released for an audience's consumption, there is nothing that you can do.  I mean, technically speaking you can, with director's cut if, by any chance, the director wasn't satisfied with the cut that was released in theaters.  But, really, you only really get director's cuts with major movies.  I doubt The Bye Bye Man is gonna get a director's cut ever.  Nothing is impossible in this world, but I'd be willing to put money on that.  I don't know what, if anything, Stacy Title would have done with this movie.  For all we know, she's satisfied with the end result, thought I find that highly unlikely.  Also, she directed this movie based on a script written by her husband, so there's that.  That's really irrelevant.  But, let us move on, shall we?  As if it wasn't obvious to you by now, I did not think that this was a very good movie, like at all.  In fact, I'd have to say that this was very bad.  If I'm being honest, and I always am, I only really ended up watching this on a whim.  I was actually gonna watch Don't Knock Twice and when I searched for that movie on Amazon Prime, this one also came up.  Both were available to me as a result of my Showtime week-long free trial.  I saw this and I was like 'fuck it, I'll watch this'.  Simple as a that.  I really had no intentions of watching this (since the Edge of Seventeen is still on my watchlist and Cronenberg's Rabid, which I may watch tonight).  It was just something I decided to do on an impulse.  That impulse turned out to be dead wrong.  DEAD WRONG I SAY!  I will say that the movie starts out promisingly enough.  Larry, played by Leigh Whannell, in 1969, shoots and kills eight of his friends, all of whom knew about the existence of the Bye Bye Man, before killing himself.  He does this to contain the knowledge of the Bye Bye Man, who makes you see things that aren't there and, generally, drives you nuts, so no one else has to suffer through this.  If everyone who knows about the Bye Bye Man is dead, he can't continue to haunt them.  Anyway, this is information we get later on.  The point I'm trying to make is that I felt that the movie starting with Larry murdering all these people was the right way to start this off.  Of course, however, the PG-13 limitations put a bit of a damper on that since you can't really get a sense of how horrible these murders were.  These people were shot with this shotgun at, relatively, close range.  So the lack of blood was very inconsistent with wounds associated with shotguns.  That lack of authenticity really hurt the movie.  And it was laughable because, later on, you see more of Larry's murderous rampage and he shoots this teenage girl.  She's slammed into the wall and she falls to the floor.  Larry moves into the kitchen and you can see the wall the girl slammed into and there's, literally, the smallest blood splatter you will have ever seen.  It's absurd.  For fuck's sake, just take the R-rating and be more gruesome.  At least it'd give us SOMETHING.  Regardless, that's neither here nor there.  Moving on almost 40 years later, these three teens (Elliot, his girlfriend Sasha and his best friend John) move into this house.  I don't know if it's Larry's former house and, honestly, I don't really care.  Anyway, they use Larry's nightstand.  Elliot finds these coins in the nightstand and this writing.  The writing says: don't think it, don't say it and a name.  That name is, of course, Bye Bye Man.  Because, really, if you're not trying to say a name, the next logical step is to write it down so, even if you're not saying it, you're thinking about it since you're seeing it.  Great fucking logic there, my dude.  Whatever.  So this happens and then strange shit starts to happen to them and this psychic lady who was there when Elliot uttered its name.  Yawn, am I right?  First things first, this is a very derivative horror movie.  It's like Freddy Krueger and Candyman wrapped into one, except not nearly as good or clever as those films.  Secondly, the Bye Bye Man itself is, literally, one of the least scariest horror villains that I've ever seen.  I had to be redundant there with the 'least scariest', because that's how ineffective he actually is.  Like what is he even supposed to be, honestly?  He wears this pajama robe with the hoodie on.  And, underneath that, he's wearing clothes you would wear to sleep.  Like sweats and a regular shirt.  His face is disfigured.  There is that, but the fact that his face is covered up for most of the movie means that he's the least threatening horror villain I've seen in ages.   I mean the guy does have what seems to be a hellhound and that might be the only 'scary' thing about him.  The first scene the hound appears in is actually decent.  But once you get a more detailed look at him, the CG on the hound is laughably bad.  Speaking of that, there's this transition from one scene to another where they show the wallpaper from the hallway, I'm assuming.  The design of this wallpaper is of this deer and a doe.  So the head of the doe slowly transitions to that of the hound who turns to look at the camera.  Like, honestly, I don't know if this was intended to be this way, but this effect was so terrible.  It was honestly just dreadful.  If this was done in earnest, like who did the wife/husband duo think they were fooling.  This can't have been planned as a legitimate scare because it's so openly awful.  I mean, I'll be frank, it made me laugh.  But it made me laugh because of how someone though that this might be a good idea.  Oh no, the killer wallpaper.  I should be SO afraid.  Give me a fucking break.  There's also this scene later in the movie, where the hound walks toward the camera and this hound is massive, but the steps he takes are so small that it's a bit of a dissonance, seeing something so menacing take such dainty steps.  I suppose now we have to move on to Elliot, Sasha and John.  I mean, do we really have to?  I guess no review about this is complete without talking about these insufferable assholes.  With the villain making you see things that aren't there or not letting you see things that ARE there, this leads to the inevitable love triangle.  Or at least the villain manipulating Elliot's mind to see things that aren't there.  And, honestly, I couldn't have cared less about these people to invest in this bullshit story.  There's an incredibly awkwardly shot sex scene where John is giving it to Sasha doggy-style but the way the camera shoots them makes it look like they're not even in the same planet.  This movie is so fucking bad, honestly.  All of these are incredibly poorly-written characters.  There's nothing to any of them.  And Sasha, oh boy, it's time we talk about Sasha.  She sets feminism back about 1000 years.  She's completely fucking useless.  She's either looking concerned, sick, coughing, crying or sleeping.  Jesus, what a fucking weakling.  Not to mention that she contributes nothing of value to the narrative.  I mean, yea, she's the one that brings Kim (the psychic) to do a seance.  But, other than that, the only thing she does is just take up valuable time and space.  Well, really, maybe not valuable.  She might be the most useless female character I've seen since Bella Swan.  But, at the very least, as awful as those movies still are, Bella finally started fighting for herself and her weird, CG daughter.  Sasha is even more useless than a damsel in distress, if such a thing is possible.  Elliot and John are just unlikable assholes.  Carrie Anne Moss, inexplicably, is in this movie.  I imagine they cast her because they were probably planning for this to be so successful that they would get a sequel, so they needed to plant the seeds in this movie with her character to, possibly, continue on.  The very notion that this movie would get a sequel is laughable to me.  Also, Faye Dunaway is here.  She needs that machine from Eternal Sunshine so she can erase the memories of ever appearing in a movie so terrible.  The reality is that this, if handled correctly, could have been an exploration of mental health issues told through a horror lens.  Of course, the idea that this movie could tackle such heavy objects adeptly is, also, highly laughable.  The climax is...ok, but obviously not nearly enough to save this.  There's a, almost, a clever twist in that you think it's finally over, but Elliot's niece (who's name I can't remember and I don't care) was outside their house during the climax (with her father, Elliot's brother).  She was roaming around to pee or something.  After Elliot kills himself and they're riding home, the girl tells her dad about the writing in the nightstand.  He asks her what the writing said.  And she replied that she can't see in the dark.  Actually, we'll get to what she actually says in a bit.  So I was like, ok, that was pretty decent.  And this is where we'll end the movie, you think it's over, but it's not, but it is because the girl couldn't see in the dark.  Nope, they fucked themselves out of a conclusive ending, but it is what it is.  Time to get into what Elliot's niece actually said.  She said, and I quote, \"You know I can't read in the dark.  What do you think I am?  A flashlight?\" and she said this with a smirk on her face like she was so proud of herself for having coming up with such a zinger.  And never have I ever wanted to kick a child in the face as much as I did at that moment.  Other than that, it was such a CRINGE-WORTHY line.  I cringed so hard that I thought my face was permanently gonna be that way.  No woman would ever love me, for having such a hideous face.  It's not the only cringe-worthy moment in the film.  Everything with this little annoying asshole of a niece is terrible.  Just like everything about this movie, outside of the beginning, is terrible.  Having seen this movie and experienced its awfulness, it's no surprise to me that Stacy Title and Jonathan Penner have not gone on to become a successful filmmaking duo.  With movies this bad, you just wanna put them on a rocket ship and send them to the moon where they can keep making their shitty movies for themselves.  I hated, almost, every single second of this.  I'd rather have pink-eye than suffer through this again.  Umm, yea, don't watch this.  A few laughable moments don't make up for the overall hideousness this movie gladly provides to you on a silver platter.",

            "content": "I think La La Land has a shadowy culprit to blame for the big slip-up at the 2017 Academy Awards where it mistakenly was declared Best Picture before the rightful winner, Moonlight, was crowned. Actress Faye Dunaway was the one who spoke aloud the infamous slip-up, but I think she had something else on her mind. She was so preoccupied with trying NOT to think about the Bye Bye Man that she wasn't fully paying attention to the moment. Fortunately, Moonlight got its rightful due. Unfortunately, The Bye Bye Man exists as a horror film and Dunaway within it. This is a movie whose mantra is \"Don't say it, don't think it,\" all but begging to be forgotten.\n\nIf The Bye Bye Man had been the film it appears to be in its opening scene, we might have had an effectively unnerving horror thriller. We watch in a single long take as a distressed man drives home, mutters to himself, and takes out a rifle and systematically kills every person who admits they said \"it\" or told someone. He goes from person to person, pleading whether they told anyone, and it's always yes. Then he moves on to kill that person, asking them the same question. It's an effectively chilling scene and a fantastic way to open a horror movie. And it's all sadly downhill from there, folks. The rest of the movie is a stupid thriller with stupid teenagers doing stupid things.\n\nAny power the Bye Bye Man has as a concept, a mimetic virus, is wasted as a goofy Boogeyman knockoff with vague powers and intentions. Apparently, one of the insidious side effects of the Bye Bye Man is his ability to cause erectile dysfunction. After the first night he-who-shall-not-be-named is named, two of our college students talk about trying again and how \"that\" never happens to them, all but implying the Bye Bye Man was a sexual detriment. Another weirdly defined power is that the Bye Bye Man causes his victims to see hallucinations, though sometimes they're nightmares like maggots crawling out of eyeballs, and other times they're fantasy, like a naked friend beckoning for a lustful tryst. One character hears disturbing scratching noises and then visions of people standing buck naked on train tracks (the amount of brief nudity made me recheck that this received a PG-13 rating). \"We're all losing our minds at the same time,\" a character bemoans at the 41-minute mark. At one point, the Bye Bye Man sends himself as a GIF, knowing how to reach millennials. I don't understand why these kids don't accept that if they see something horrific it's probably false. They know the Bye Bye Man is terrorizing them with their fears and yet they fall for it every time. When you're talking with someone and all of a sudden they start seeping blood from every orifice, maybe that should be a clue. If Elliot (Douglas Smith) knows he's afraid of his girlfriend sleeping with his best friend, then shouldn't he doubt the voracity of seeing them together after the malevolent force with evil visions has entered his life? What's the point of scratching \"don't say it, don't think it\" as a preventative measure? That calls more attention to the forbidden item. It's like in Inception, when they say, \"don't think about elephants,\" and invariably that's what you're going to think about.\n\nIf the Bye Bye Man can make people say its name, then why isn't it doing this all the time? Why all the hallucinations to drive teens to kill themselves? That seems ultimately counter productive to Bye Bye Man business. Any businessperson will tell you the key to expanding your outreach is through happy customers. Fulfill these people's wishes and then come to collect later. I can write an entire proposal for the Bye Bye Man to shore up his business. He seems to be doing everything wrong. If the goal of the Bye Bye Man is to spread its name/message, along the same lines of self-preservation through proliferation like the haunted Ring VHS tape, then it needs a more straightforward approach. Let these doomed teenagers know their nightmares will end if they bring in an additional however many new victims. Alas, the Bye Bye Man is painfully unclear (it even has zero references on the Google imitator search) and just another boo spook.\n\nEven for horror movies, the characters can be powerfully boring and meaningless. The entire premise is a group of college kids moving into a house that used to be owned by the crazy guy in the opening flashback. They each take turns seeing things, hearing things, and doing things, some as mundane as scribbling without their direct knowledge. The plot is in a holding pattern that requires characters to repeat the threat over and over. The only setup we have with these characters is one house party so we don't exactly know what they're like before they start going crazy. Much of their hallucinatory confusion could be mitigated if they just communicated with one another. \"Help, Friend A, I am seeing [this]. Is that what you are seeing as well, Friend A?\" It leads to a lot of rash actions for supposed friends. Elliot even refers to his friend as a \"jock,\" which is a term I don't think anyone out of high school says. When the police suspect Elliot of foul play once his friends start dying, he is acting completely guilty. He begs Carrie Anne Moss (The Matrix) not to force him to say a certain name or else her kids might be in danger. That sounded like a thinly veiled threat. And then the police let him go!\n\nThe mystery of the Bye Bye Man's history is the only point of interest in this story, and even that has its limits. The librarian (Cleo King) is hilariously hyper focused on delivering exposition. She even knows the protagonist on a first name basis. I think she lives to tell people about this one weird event in the school's history. She even calls Elliot on the phone! The librarian reaches out to him, saying, \"I've had some strange dreams ever since we talked.\" She then asks if she can come over to his house later. What kind of relationship does this person forge with students? Dunaway is featured as the wife of the opening killer, and I just felt so sorry for her during every second on screen. She deserves better than this. Somebody go check on Faye Dunaway and make sure she's okay.\n\nThe Bye Bye Man is a horror movie that's so bad it can be outlandishly funny. It starts off well and deteriorates rapidly, abandoning sense and atmosphere for jumbled scares. There's an extended bit during a climactic dramatic moment where a father has to convince his daughter to pee out in public. I felt so bad for every actor involved. I'll even spoil the ending, which made me howl with laughter. A little girl talks about how she saw a table with some writing. \"What did the writing say?' her father asks, and oh no, here we go again you think to yourself. Then a second later the little girl says, \"Daddy, you know I can't read in the dark! What do you think I am, a flashlight?\" My God, that moment should have been followed by a rimshot. This half-baked movie opens up a lot more questions than it has the ability to answer. What is the mythology of this character? What's with the constant train imagery? Why does the Bye Bye Man have a pet dog? Why are the coins a significant part of its Bye Bye motif? And always, if it can simply make people talk, why isn't it doing this all the time to spread its name? The Bye Bye Man is fun bad but oh is it still bad.\n\nNate's Grade: D",

The Bye Bye Man isn't the least bit scary and feels somewhat like a pale imitation of Final Destination as the characters are doomed to be killed off and the only question is how and when. Unfortunately the performances are pretty poor throughout, with Cressida Bonas giving a particularly poor performance as Sasha. The CGI and special effects are also quite poor with a weird dog like creature that looks unbelievably fake and a Bye Bye Man that looks like he's trick or treating. Overall, a disappointment and one of the least enjoyable horror films to come out this year.",

So sad that you could predict the entire film, despite their best effort to turn it around. The good news is, if you are not a horror film fan, you possibly would enjoy it. But those who love and watch horror films regularly would find it somewhat a waste of time. I was the first one, and I thought it was better than some of the recent big names from the same genre.\n\nYeah, looks a mix of plenty of films. It was somewhat like 'It Follows', but less complicated. Easy to follow the characters and the story. Though from the beginning itself, it was very intentional. A decent cast and the filmmaking. It could be scary for some viewers, but I found a little edgy and well paced narration. But sadly it did not miss any of the usual horror flick formula. One of the most overused, not just in this film, but any horror films is that those film character interviewing the one of the survivours from the past. So if you don't mind such common usage, it is an acceptable film.\n\n6/10",

Flickering lights, check. Characters searching alone in the dark for the source of a mysterious noise while repeatedly calling out 'Hello, is anyone there?', check. Bad guys walking past the camera while the protagonists have their backs turned, check. Threatening writing plastered all over a wall/ceiling/object, check. It's such a shame that films like this are still being made with no innovation or originality. Building suspense is evidently too hard for the filmmakers and beyond the attention span of modern audiences, so in its place we get jump scares galore. The acting isn't good, the script is poor, the story progression is frustrating and non-sensical and the ending leaves us with the terrifying prospect of a sequel. A sequel to The Bye Bye Man? You can make your own jokes about that one.

However, everything this movie does takes that premise and brings it down. I legitimately found this more of a parody movie than a serious horror film, as a lot of the acting, and the incredibly terrible CGI in some scenes were just comically bad. With almost every horror scene in this movie, I felt like I had already seen it before, and with the exception of some of the scenes where The Bye Bye Man uses his deception to trick people, it seemed as though it was a carbon copy of other horror movies.

Could they have delved deeper into where the Bye Bye Man originated from? Yes. Could the ending have had more of a twist? Yeah, sure. But keeping in mind all the crappy horror movies I'm seeing these days I'm going to store this one in the \"good\" category. Definitely worth a watch.",

The characters sit around explaining things about the antagonist, rather than have the movie show us. For example, someone goes at great length to mention that saying \"The Bye-Bye Man\" to anyone \"spreads\" the evil like a virus. It would have been a lot better if we actually got to see that, rather than listen to someone explaining it. There was way too much talking in general in this movie. It really needed to be cut out.\n\nThird... I have to give this more than one star because of how hilarious this movie was. It was no masterpiece of comedy, because it also bored and frustrated me at various parts. But good lord, when this movie was at the height of badness, it was better than most comedies. In fact, this film would have worked great as a satire if it was billed as one, due to how utterly ridiculous it was.\n\nAnd what was with the girlfriend getting sick? That went completely nowhere. I thought by the end, she'd be violently ill, vomiting blood, something. None of that happened. It played no part in the plot or in character. What was the point of that?\n\nOverall, it was funny, but not worth another viewing.",

Indeed there were moments which lacked in the realm of originality( the convient information found through an internet search, or the character archtype of the wise old individual who survived the antagonist in the past). The film relied upon lesser used means to build tensions. Sure, they used jump scares, but The Bye Bye Man did not rely upon them the way other pieces from this genre so often use. Furthermore, I found the Greek symbolism (relative to death) throughout the film to be refreshing. Given the quality of current horror films coming out of Hollywood, I'd have to say this film is above average.",

Let's talk about The Bye-Bye Man...\n\nOfficial Synopsis: Three friends stumble upon the horrific origins of a mysterious figure they discover is the root cause of the evil behind unspeakable acts.\n\nPlot: Three college students move into a house and then find a dresser and then bad things happen and then the movie ends.\n\nTake: I was warned to not watch this movie by a few critic friends of mine. I was warned not to see this movie by the bad trailers. I was warned not to see this movie the reviews. Yet, I gave Redbox a $1.50 to see for myself. There was only one question that I wanted answered going into seeing The Bye-Bye Man: Which is worse, Rings or The Bye-Bye Man?\nThe answer is they are both awful movies.\n\nHaving said that both movies had similar production issues. They were both sitting on a shelf for a few years, had release dates change a few times, and wholly unnecessary stories.\n\nI'm going to use as much effort and creativity in this review as the writers, director, actors, and producers put into the making of this \"film.\" The acting was about as close to the worst I have seen in any movie, ever. I do not want to be disrespectful, maybe the actors are sweet talented kids. Maybe the direction or edits took away from their performances, maybe, but Douglas Smith (Elliot), Cressida Bonas (Sasha), and especially Lucien Laviscount (John) were really bad in the cut we all get to see.\n\nScreenwriter Jonathan Penner (nothing of note) and director Stacy Title (same nothings of note) have collaborated before on previous projects, and again might be sweet heart human beings, but the movie they crafted was atrocious. \n\nRecommendation: I don't think this qualifies as one of those bad movies you watch with your friends with a few drinks to see how bad it is. Stay away. I am sure it will be in a bargain bin by Christmas and packaged with a better movie to force you to buy it soon enough. \n\nTIER ONE!!! Handshake, chest bump, smile...

One of them finds a nightstand that has cryptic writing scribbled on the inside drawer, but underneath that is four words carved into the wood: \"The Bye Bye Man\".  Turns out that everybody who has ever read or heard this combination of words is condemned to a horrific death filled with hallucinations.  Will our trio of heroes be able to survive this?  Now I had already heard stories of how bad this is, and horror releases dumped out in January do have the tendency to be on the lacking side of quality.  The Bye Bye Man is no different, so horror fans: don't get your hopes up.  Now I could have forgiven a lot of this movie if there was anything about it that was legitimately scary or creepy.  If I had gotten just maybe ten minutes of chills, I would at least be writing here that genre fans should maybe rent this if they've ran out of other options.  When you break it down, the Bye Bye Man as a character is pretty lame.  He doesn't really do anything, and his one power that he has is that he makes people see things that aren't real.  He is never intimidating whenever he pops up, and all he does is sulk around in the background like an antisocial goth kid, hanging out with his CGI hell dog.  He might point at you a little bit, sure, but he never does anything that couldn't be solved by you closing your eyes.  I don't blame Doug Jones who plays the titular role, as he is a respectable working actor, he just wasn't given anything to do.  In addition to that, these are actors that don't really need to be working anymore.  Carrie-Anne Moss is the only one that gets a semi-pass for signing a bad contract, and she at least shows up.  Faye Dunaway should know better, and she is awful in a cameo role, never showing her abilities of being the capable actress that we all know that she is.  The leads are highly likely never to be seen again in future films, as they all are bad actors, even by horror movie standards.  I will say that I have seen worse, but this is a production that should have never seen the light of day, and it is the one thing that you don't want your horror movie to be: boring.",

Impressed by Allen's capabilities, General Shepherd recruits him into Task Force 141. While Allen prepares for an upcoming assignment, Captain John \"Soap\" MacTavish and Sergeant Gary \"Roach\" Sanderson infiltrate a Russian airbase in the Tian Shan mountains to retrieve an Attack Characterization System (ACS) module from a downed American satellite.\n\nAllen is soon sent on an undercover mission in Russia for the CIA, joining Vladimir Makarov in a mass shooting at an airport in Moscow. After leaving the airport, Makarov, who has been aware of Allen's true identity, kills him and leaves his body behind to spark a war between Russia and the United States. Outraged by what is believed to be an American-sponsored terrorist attack, Russia retaliates by launching a surprise invasion on the East Coast of the United States.[a][32] With no evidence of Makarov's involvement in the airport massacre, Task Force 141 is sent to Rio de Janeiro to capture Makarov's arms dealer. They capture the dealer, and learn that Makarov's nemesis is being held in a Russian gulag. Task Force 141 assaults the gulag and rescues the prisoner, who is revealed to be Captain Price, a member of the British Special Air Service.[b]\n\nPrice agrees to help Task Force 141, but insists that his priority is to end the war in the United States. After raiding a Russian port, Price launches a ballistic missile towards Washington, D.C. and sets it to detonate in the upper atmosphere. The resulting EMP blast disables all electronic devices across the eastern seaboard, causing both factions to suffer but giving the Americans a much-needed advantage.[33] Soldiers fighting in Washington, D.C. narrowly avoid a bombing run of Russian-occupied strategic structures by the United States Air Force, when they light green flares atop the White House, showing that the city remains in American hands.\n\nMeanwhile, Task Force 141 narrows Makarov's hiding place to two locations; Price and Soap travel to an aircraft boneyard in Afghanistan to intercept an arms deal, while Roach and Lieutenant Simon \"Ghost\" Riley raid Makarov's safehouse on the Georgian-Russian border. Although Makarov himself is absent, Roach and his team obtain vital information on the antagonist; however, when they reach the extraction point, Shepherd betrays them, retrieving the intelligence and taking it with him, murdering Roach and Ghost and burning their bodies in the process. It soon becomes evident that Shepherd is the catalyst of the war between Russia and the U.S. with the intent of generating a massive wave of American enlistment, along with defense spending and production in a time of emergency. Shepherd sent Allen to participate in the massacre, fully aware that Makarov would set America up; he also allegedly provided the ACS to the Russian forces to be compromised, informed Makarov of Allen's identity, and eventually managed to secure a blank check from the government to fund his war effort, his endgame being to kill Makarov himself and usurp the glory, thus cementing his status as a national hero. Price and Soap learn of Shepherd's betrayal, and escape a battle between Shepherd's and Makarov's forces.\n\nPrice contacts Makarov on an open radio channel, where Makarov reluctantly reveals Shepherd's mountain base in Afghanistan. Price and Soap raid the base to take revenge on Shepherd in a suicide mission; during the infiltration, Shepherd attempts to escape on a boat, with Price and Soap in hot pursuit. At the climax of the pursuit, Shepherd sails into a helicopter, but Price shoots it down as he and Soap tumble over a waterfall.[32] A dazed Soap stumbles towards the crash of the helicopter, and attempts to kill Shepherd, but is stabbed in the chest. When Price arrives and engages Shepherd in a fist fight, Soap pulls the knife out of his chest and throws it at Shepherd, killing him. Nikolai, who arrives to recover the duo, and Price evacuate Soap for medical attention.",

The Bye Bye Man would've been the perfect bad movie if it was at least a little bit scary, with maybe one or two nail-bitingly scary scenes. Nope! The Bye Bye Man is just some dude with a hoodie and scars on his face. The CGI dog looks even worse. The scariest thing the Bye Bye Man did in the film was point. The jump scares were so cheap. The worst one was when he appeared in a window reflection. The first act was a bit slow, but I highly recommend The Bye Bye Man if you enjoy bad movies.",

The film seems tries so hard to scare its audience, hurling jump scares from each corner of the ring at break-neck speed and when I actually stopped jumping, I realised that what was actually happening on screen wasn't that scary at all... The villain is quite unique, but unfortunately because of a drab performance he is quite easily forgettable, especially when they insist on him looking like a goth junkie, complete with dark eye shadow and a hoodie.

The film makes absolutely no sense as the script is so contradictory, for example you aren't supposed to think of the Bye Bye Man; so why on earth in one scene is the main character shouting in his car 'Bye Bye'? The acting is absolutely horrendous, to be fair the lead guy is trying and isn't that awful. The best friend however is so wooden and the girlfriend is absolutely dreadful. The directing is terrible as the film looks like it was made for about $2. The from isn't scary it's just very boring and is full of cheap jump scares and dreadful 'suspense'. This film also has some of the worst cgi I've seen in quite a while, especially the Bye Bye Man's weird dog. The only real positives are that the opening scene is semi decent and the film is destined to become a so bad it's good film in years to come.

Overall, The Bye Bye Man was done well in the aspect of horror, but lacked immense story.",

The story gets rushed forward and moments that could've heighten the suspense and tension to ultimately scare the bejezzus out of everyone (seriously there's this scene with two little doors and a kid that had me yelling \"oh HEEEELLLL NO\" at the screen) didn't hold the thread. There were several ironic song references and moments of macabre comedy that carried the movie and looked like it would get it back on track few times but ultimately the story was just rushed.

It's actually a pretty freaky and believable concept-in the I believe in scare folktales as fact kind of way-but it settled for standard (poorly plotted) genre tricks to play out its story on screen and that choice seriously short changes the audience.\n\nSo instead of an increasingly spine-chilling movie you get one with fits and starts of good suspenseful moments to rushed dialogue to really well executed turmoil and confusion, to over emoting that fails to build tension to typical horror gimmicks (there's a s\u00e9ance and everything) and poorly timed music shifts right to the obvious open-ended conclusion leaving the door open for the boogie man's possible return.\n\nFor the most part, the cast wasn't too bad except for the lead actress, Cressida Bonas, who played Sasha.

She played her role with wit, flair and subtly. She lost her shit with a peppy note in her voice and bounce in her step. Not to mention, her death was all kinds of jacked up - as it should be, she's the LIBRARIAN. Another honorable mention, the Widow Redmon, played by Faye Dunaway was rather well done.

I'm sad to say it but The Bye Bye Man is just ok; as in the shoulder shrug \"eh\" kind of ok.\n\nIt's a shame because any movie that includes its characters having wicked detailed and realistic hallucinations and someone taking a vigorously swung bat to the head, could've been something great.",

I find that most of the acting was decent but the characters were badly written. The girlfriend of Elliot seemed distant in the entire film but i think the actor that played Elliot was phenomenal. I could really get that \"I'm slowly going insane\" vibe from his performance. The ending was unexpected but the reactions towards the end of this movie were very dull. I find that my two favorite characters in the movie were the female police officer and Elliot. The movie wasn't as bad as i thought it would be, but it wasn't exactly good either. all in all i would probably re-watch this movie sometime in the future but it hasn't become a favorite for me.",

            "content": "For all the criticism this film has received, it had incredible turnout it's opening weekend for a picture not backed by a major studio. Even oscar-caliber films are criticized for every inconceivable flaw, and what is silly is how much criticism this  film is receiving when it is the combined efforts of two underground artists, a director and a writer, who happen to be married, and who also happened to get their picture not just produced, but edited, budgeted, and displayed to sold-out showings across the country, which is remarkable, considering it is a thriller/slasher/horror genre film being released in an off season for that genre.\n\nThe builds are dynamic, not just in plot, but in each character. Though the supporting characters do not have detailed back stories like that of the protagonist's, they are just as relatable, which makes for a symphony of interacting stories and perceptions between all four of the main characters as they begin to lose their ability to distinguish between reality and insanity. \nThe detailed shots took nothing for granted; the smallest of intricacies were honored, and pacing was playfully anticipatory and individual. Every once in a while you would get a very \"Lynchian\" or \"Kubrick\" style-shot, with enlongated sequences that had everyone in the theater holding their breath, waiting for something to pop out, as you follow this little girl, or follow this person into the dark. The pacing was such that you could never predict when things were going to happen, which to me, is a benchmark of a good horror film.\nThe jumps were not relied upon, but rather planned so carefully, that for rows in front of me, I could see the entire theater jump, and sometimes people even let out shocked bloodcurdling screams. The ending left people gasping, and what was remarkable to me was that even after the major plot twist (which is brilliantly crafted, in writing, and in the shot itself), the ending is still done in a way that leaves the viewer biting their nails, begging the protagonist to be strong, as if they were in his shoes themselves. \nThese \"plot holes\" people are describing are actually brilliantly placed. Whether it is the legend of the slender man, or the boogyman, or whatever it be; the mystery of the title character is what makes him the epitome of human terror: he is only personified through the perspective of the person witnessing his presence, and since fear is a product of only our mind's worst imagination of unknowns, I think this film in fact does exemplary justice to the fear category of film making. What cannot be denied is that in the smallest details of this film there is unparalleled symbolism, even the professor's small speech in the background of one character's building nightmare has dialogue that contains key and often overlooked plot points and brilliant writing that only adds to the detailed symbolism of this film that speaks so much to the nature of the concept of fear. I won't spoil any surprises, but I will say that this story displays how effectively fear works on the strength of a human mind. It is compelling storytelling that has you hoping as if you were in the main character's shoes, trying with all your might to be as mentally strong as to overcome your own sanity. Despite the fact that this was the lovechild of two artists who actually made a film happen, it's a film that stands, for every detail from it's writing to it's character builds to it's cinematic excellence. Highly underrated effort, and a beautiful homage to classic horror/slasher genre. I highly recommend giving The Bye Bye Man a chance, don't believe everything you read online, everyone loves to criticize, but so few people consider all factors of what makes a film worth watching.",

An absolutely abysmal excuse for a film, let alone something that was supposed to inspire fear in its viewers. The most terrifying thing about it was a combination of the incomprehensible stupidity of the dialogue and the lackluster performances by... well, everyone involved in production. If there were any attempts made at creating tension within the story, they were obliterated by hackneyed execution and dialogue so inscrutable and cringe-worthy, I'm half convinced that it was written entirely by AI. And if the dialogue and writing weren't bad enough, the cinematography may very well give you an aneurysm. There exist found footage films that have a steadier handle on their camera's movements. Just wait for The Bye Bye Man to come out on DVD and give it a rent if you want to have a good laugh. Otherwise, I can't recommend spending your money on this wretched thing in good conscience.",

Overall this film was badly written, characters had zero development and zero acting skills.Generally in horror films there is some development or knowledge to the antagonistic character of the film to give reason to who or what they are and why they do whatever it is they do.

This could easily be seen as a metaphor for 'the evil inside us all', and at its surface sounds quite interesting, the only problem is, this film does not do it particularly well.\n \nThe acting is OK I guess, but oftentimes comes across like the film didn't have enough money to reshoot some scenes that were not up to par. One scene in particular is when Elliot and Sasha are on campus and have the lamest 'goodbye I love you' moment I have ever seen on screen. The other big issue with the film is that it is just sort of boring. The movie tries to create a creepy and compelling vibe, but oftentimes I just felt bored and uninterested in the characters. Worst of all, I walked out of the film, feeling as if it was longer than the time it actually ran, never a good sign.\n \nI will say however, that this movie didn't rely on jump scares nearly as much as I am used to with these horror movies, and at least put forth an effort into creating a good tone.\n \nAll in all, The Bye Bye Man is a standard January horror flick, cheesy, uninteresting, and poorly acted, but unlike most other January horror films, seems like it was at least putting forth an effort, even if the result wasn't always there. With all of that being said, I rate the film a 49/100, or 4.9/10 because I just can't force myself to say this film was good.",

The simple act of trying not to think about something probably means that you are still thinking about it - or that the undesirable thought is lurking just beneath the surface of your conscious focus. That's what makes the premise of the supernatural horror thriller \"The Bye Bye Man\" (PG-13, 1:36) interesting. If an evil entity will appear or gain control of your perceptions of the real world, and your will, if you merely think his name, then you're probably fighting a losing battle. And you can't even warn others about the danger because saying his name is just as bad as thinking it. \n\nIn an otherwise quiet suburban neighborhood on a sunny day in 1969, a man continuously repeats the words \"Don't think it. Don't say it,\" as he retrieves a shotgun from the trunk of his car. He proceeds to shoot several family members and neighbors in order to \"save\" them from an unseen entity known as \"The Bye Bye Man\". The ordinary-looking gunman feels that he has to eliminate those who have learned the name or spoken it to anyone else. After his bloody rampage, he then puts himself out of his misery.\n\nJump to the present day in that same neighborhood. Three college students, boyfriend-girlfriend Elliot (Douglas Smith) and Sasha (Cressida Bonas), and their mutual friend, John (Lucien Laviscount), move into an old, rundown house that they have rented off campus. As they move the furniture which comes with the house up from the basement, they fail to notice that inside the drawer of a small end table, someone has written \"Don't think it. Don't say it,\" in concentric circles. The students do notice that a coin keeps falling to the floor and spinning and that the house is always cold. This leads Elliot to go do some research at the library where a helpful librarian (Cleo King) helps unravel the house's forgotten past. The students also ask a \"spiritual sensitive\" friend named Kim (Jenna Kanell) to conduct a s\u00e9ance. \n\nThe process of learning about this mysterious \"Bye Bye Man\" results in his name being thought about and spoken out loud, which makes him appear - and allows him access to the minds of those who know his name. The Bye Bye Man is a gaunt and ghostly man dressed like the grim reaper (and played by Doug Jones) and is accompanied by a ghastly hellhound. When inside the heads of his victims, he makes them see things that aren't there, prompting them to do things they weren't normally do... with horrifying results. A police detective (Carrie-Anne Moss) becomes involved when things get out of hand, but it's nearly impossible for her to be of any help when those who know what is going on can't tell her about it.\n\nUnfortunately, \"The Bye Bye Man\" fails to live up to the potential of its original and frightening premise, the whole thing seeming random and inconsequential. This movie is based on one chapter of Robert Damon Schneck's non-fiction book \"The President's Vampire\" and is supposedly a true story. With that kind of background, screenwriter Jonathan Penner should've been able to set up the plot more effectively - and written action and dialog that makes sense. And director Stacy Title should've been able to make the movie scarier. And the acting could've been a lot better. And if someone suggests that you come along to see this film, just repeat the main character's name back to them and walk away. \"D\"",

During that 50%, the story is unraveled well, it pulls no punches, Douglas Smith turns in a super intense performance, and an appropriately cryptic mystery is barely hinted at. Probably the movie's biggest problem - or asset, depending on your mood - is that it never warns you when it'll switch between the awesome and the horrible.

            "content": "It's January and that means it's time for an awful horror movie. This year's incarnation of that oddly persistent tradition comes in the form of The Bye Bye Man, a film so nonsensical that even its own writers don't seem to understand how its villain works.\n        The Bye Bye man is basically a cross between The Ring and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Kind of. The titular character operates as a curse of sorts; once you read or see his name, he gets into your head and.... stuff happens. I'm not sure why a lot of the stuff happens, but it does. He can make you see things that aren't really there. He can also make you not see things that are there. I think. I'm largely assuming that ability, as I have no other explanation for a character standing on railroad trucks and being dumbfounded by the arrival of a train that has been loudly heading toward her. He can also make you kill your friends and family. Sort of. This point is also a bit unclear, as characters explicitly state that he is forcing them to commit acts of violence. But at other times, they are consciously killing people in an effort to prevent the further spread of the curse before offing themselves to seal the deal. So the Bye Bye Man can make you kill people to prevent his own continued existence....I guess. I don't freaking know. This villain's sense of self-preservation is lacking. \n        But the B-B Man isn't the only one seriously lacking in the survival skills department. His victims are driven mad in stunningly quick fashion and seemingly resort to murder-suicide as their first option in the face of adversity. Their problem largely amounts to hallucinations. That is problematic, sure, but one might try to learn to live and function with them before just saying \"screw it!\" and going on a killing spree. If you found out, in the course of your day, that a demon was making you hallucinate to get you to hurt your loved ones and then you stumbled upon your best friend having sex with your girlfriend, would you A. Consider that the hallucinations may be causing this and you might want to take a minute to assess the situation or B. Immediately grab a baseball bat and swing at your friend's head? If you went with the latter option, then you would fit in very well in this movie. The main character even has an epiphany, lifted directly from A Nightmare on Elm Street, in which he realizes that the B-B Man derives his power from belief and fear, and that one must only not believe in him. There is no basis for this realization and perhaps the character simply wrote it off between scenes because he promptly forgets this in the next scene and goes on not knowing that hallucinations are a thing. \n        I haven't gone into much detail about the Bye Bye Man himself, largely because the movie didn't either. He is a generic looking villain in a black cloak, a bit sith-like, and he makes the aforementioned stuff happen. I'm hard-pressed to remember another horror villain that neither speaks nor actually does anything, instead relying on his victims to take themselves out through their own incompetence. The only thing that he actually does is point at people in an ominous fashion, so there is that. What is somewhat fascinating is the number of elements that are introduced and then never explained. There are a pair of coins that are shown repeatedly and seem to be of some relevance and importance to the Bye Bye Man. I'm not sure why, as this element is never explained. Neither is the association of trains with our villain. Several times we hear train noises that seem to signal his arrival (assumedly for more ominous pointing) and we even see footage of a train spliced into the film without elaboration. Why? I don't know. Maybe he prefers to commute to his victims via train? Oh, and he has a dog. More of a hell-hound, really. Imagine the dog-monsters protecting Gozer at the end of Ghosbusters, except in god-awful CGI. This thing is never named and its purpose is never explained, he just shows up periodically and seems to hang out in the closet in his down time. \n        I also haven't into too much detail about the characters and this is because I don't remember them.  I don't want to be too critical of the young actors, all of whom were unfamiliar to me, because the script gave them nothing to work with. They could be perfectly fine actors or they could be terrible, but this film gave me no basis for that determination with characters and dialogue so forgettable that I am now struggling (less than 24 hours later) to name a single character in the damn thing. The only actors that I recognized are Faye Dunaway (!) as an exposition dump and Carrie-Ann Moss, who provides the film's single somewhat effective scene in the form of a police interrogation. Even Doug Jones is wasted as the title character, as the villain's complete inactivity fails to justify the need for Jones in the role. \n        I must also comment on the film's rating, as the initial R-rated cut was trimmed to a PG-13. I generally dislike PG-13 horror, but this was a particularly blatant case of absurd editing. People are shot point-blank with a shotgun without a drop of blood to be seen. A sex scene is edited so awkwardly that my friend turned to me and inquired \"how are they both on top?\" I don't know, man. As with everything else in this movie, I just don't know.\n        Please don't go see this. I have seen worse horror movies lately (Shut In, The Darkness, The Other Side of the Door), but this is clearly designed as a franchise-starter and I don't want to be stuck with sequels every year. I can go without knowing what was up with the damn train.",

Yes I did.\" Not that the quality of this piece of cinema comes to my surprise giving that we are in the middle of January, also known as the month that you should not be going to the theater to see new releases, but instead going to the theater to see all of the entertainment you missed in December. But, not only am I trying to see more movies of the current year, I was also hoping for a miracle. Could \"The Bye Bye Man\" be the saving grace to January for horror films, and wipe away the bad tastes of recent efforts like 2016's \"The Forest\", 2015's \"The Woman in Black 2\", or even 2013's dreadful \"Texas Chainsaw 3D.\" In short, the answer is \"Of course not.\" This movie, like relatively all January horror releases, insists on making the audience jump out of their seat rather than making their skin crawl and build tension. Speaking of tension, there is no tension in this movie. None. Not even a little bit. Everything about \"The Bye Bye Man\" relies on, wait for it, jump scares. And don't get me wrong, I honestly am not the kind of person that wants jump scares completely scrapped from every future horror film. What  I want is for horror movies to not completely rely on them, especially if it's just slamming doors and people running into each other while a brutally loud noise erupts through the auditorium to startle the crowd. That is lazy and uncalled for and completely ruins anything that the movie is trying to accomplish. And of course, that is all \"The Bye Bye Man\" is. Because of this, I am not going to be thinking or talking about this movie after I am done posting this, which ironically is what the characters are attempting to do the entirety of the movie's 96 minute running time. So, should you see \"The Bye Bye Man?\" No you shouldn't. While there possible was a total of 5 minutes during the movie where I was getting into the story, the constant attempts to startle me rather than scare me left me, like most January horror films do, with a bad taste in my mouth. 3.3/10",

So the bye bye man supposedly possessed the 3 college students which made them go on a killing spree because it isn't a supernatural horror movie without getting someone possessed. They get some information about the bye bye man and that the only way to escape his curse is to not say or think about him because he gets in your head and takes control.

The Bye Bye Man is a horrible supernatural horror film that has a direction that's not sure if its trying to make the audience laugh or scared. It has some dull acting, boring direction, and the scares are nonetheless not there. Bye Bye Man has that folk title of a fiction character that once the name is said, he will come with his demonic hound and the people involved would be delusional, see things, makes them want to hurt each other as their weakness is revealed and even kill each other. \n\nThe plot follows Elliot (Douglas Smith) and his girlfriend Sasha (Cressida Bonas) and friend John (Lucien Laviscount) moving into a house together. They find some old furniture in a basement. And a night stand that constantly drops coins. Once they find a carving of a title The Bye Bye Man inside the drawer and accidentally saying it. Elliot, Sasha, and John will have to do whatever it takes to beat this supernatural force. They have to follow the one rule, of don't think it, don't say it. \n\nThis film feels like a shadowed version with horror ionic characters like Candyman, Boogeyman, etc. I am sure there are better horror movies that will provide scares than this. This film does lack scares, thrills, and its not even exciting. From the opening moments, of 1960's seeing a man yelling out loud \"don't think it, don't say it.\" And killing people. I love how characters are written to be as dumb as they just stand right in front of the threat as it happens. It gets worse, and more annoying especially when the tagline of don't say it is mentioned quite a lot. Not sure, if its either terrible acting or just cheesy to see on screen. \n\nLets talk about the acting. The acting was horrible and every character is written as one- dimensional. The actors definitely looked like they are reading straight from the script without even building their characters. Elliot may seem like the reasonable caring character, which loves his girlfriend and friend and his brother and niece. Especially, when his brother and niece come by their house a lot. Even at midnight, when Elliot is trying to keep his family away from the bye bye man being noticed by them. One main issue I had was who takes a little girl out to visit their uncle after midnight. Seems kind of late for visiting. Also, I feel like Carrie-Anne Moss talent is wasted here, as she plays a detective trying to figure out these strange webs of murders. She comes and goes on screen. \n\nThe Bye Bye Man may seem like a creepy character that stands in the shadows in a dark room. But its nothing scary about the guy besides making everyone around him go mad. Besides the movie having a boring direction that does not provide scares and just a bunch young adults trying to survive against this evil figure. \n\nOverall, The Bye Bye Man is horrible. Terrible acting, no scares or thrills, and a boring direction. I do not recommend unless you're really bored.",

It is one of the most lazily constructed horror movies I've seen in many a moon. This \"Bye Bye Man\" is just a cheap imitation of other horror movie villains from the past. \"The Bye Bye Man\" looks exactly like Freddy Krueger but without his disfigured face, his razor claws or his snarly, dark humor. The victims who are presented in this movie keep saying \"Don't Think It! Don't Say It!\", \"Don't Think It!, Don't Say It!\", \"Don't Think It!, Don't Say It!\" but how about \"Don't See It!\", choosing this option will make you, me and the rest of the audience very happy.\n\nThe movie's epilogue takes place in 1969 where a man commits mass murder throughout his neighborhood all because if they spoke or mentioned about \"The Bye Bye Man\". Listen guy, you're willing to kill people you either like or love all for the purpose of speaking about a killer who's just a Freddy Krueger wannabe? You're just a sick asshole and have you ever heard of saintly crosses or the Bible?\n\n\"The Bye Bye Man\" then shifts to present day where we encounter three college students, Elliot (Douglas Smith), his girlfriend, Sasha (Cressida Bonas) and his best bud, John (Lucien Laviscount) who move into an off-campus house. As the three students throw a party, Elliot discovers a shelf with writing consisting of just \"don't think it, don't say it\" and the title name \"The Bye Bye Man\". Oh Geez, he's in for it now. As you may have guessed, weird things start happening such as Sasha developing a strange cough and Elliot finding coins over and over again.\n\nWho is this \"Bye Bye Man\" anyway? We don't know where he's from, we never get an insight into his origins, we don't know much about him? He just kills people who speak his name and that's about it. What's the trouble for speaking that name? You're probably going to be puzzled and outraged about my two theories about the Bye Bye Man. Is he the Hillary Clinton assassin who murdered Vince Foster or is he connected to the Pizzagate stories? Hey, I'm just saying! Oh yeah, the Bye Bye Man's only companion is a skinless demon dog and he's played Doug Jones who is known to comic book fanboys as Abe Sapien, from the two \"Hellboy\" films.\n\nContinuing on with the premise, as Sasha continues to be sick, Elliot starts to have hallucinations and he begins to suspect that his sick girlfriend is cheating on him with John. After a female friend of the three college mates gets killed after being struck by a train, Detective Shaw (Carrie-Anne Moss) takes Elliot in for questioning but is let go due to lack of evidence. \"The Bye Bye Man\" continues to torment poor Elliot as he tries to figure out a way to stop him and save his friends. Elliot goes to the library in order to find old news stories about the Bye Bye Man but he finds no such stories anywhere on their computer archives. No wonder Elliot can't find anything about the Bye Bye Man, this whole community seems to think that he is fake news. Eventually Elliot does find a story about the Bye Bye Man after just googling don't think it, don't say it, he discovers a story dating back to 1969 where a reporter committed mass murder in his neighborhood. Elliot also visits the reporter's widow (Faye Dunaway) about how to stop the Bye Bye Man without thinking or saying his name. The widow gives Elliot very little advice about stopping him and she warns that the Bye Bye Man curse will cause him to endure insanity, hallucinations and of course death.\n\n\"The Bye Bye Man\" is believe it or not based on a chapter from Robert Damon Schneck's book \"The President's Vampire\" and I highly doubt that he's an original horror movie killer. The acting is terrible, the screenplay by Jonathan Penner is completely inane and Stacy Title's direction is crammed with all too familiar horror movie cliches. The year maybe early but it is already looking to be another bad year for Faye Dunaway, first you took part in that Best Picture blunder with Warren Beatty and then you do this movie? She really needs to find roles that suit her well, otherwise it's game over for her career. As for the three young leads, there's no film career in your future but hey! You can always star in cruddy, direct-to-DVD turdpiles with Nicolas Cage and Bruce Willis!\n\nThere's nothing more to say about \"The Bye Bye Man\" because it's really bad. By the way, I've written the name 17 times in this review and nothing bad has happened to me. I guess it shows how scare-free it is.",

The Bye Bye Man is one of those movies that seems to fall out of the cursed orifice of January movies, one that's pretty much offensively lazy. Even at 96 minutes including credits, this movie manages to pack in more horrible acting, flat cinematography, nonexistent characterization, and lame dialogue than you'd expect from this type of movie. All the while, it's boring as hell with only a few moments of unintentional humor. It's the type of movie that has you think, \"Wow, these filmmakers were some lazy bastards,\" and then does nothing but reinforce that fact for the rest of its runtime. It's something so one-dimensional that it's just a point in the middle of space with no purpose, so frail that it might as well not exist. I don't know why I'm going to even try giving a plot synopsis, but whatever.

After the movie opens back in 1969 and shows just how bad acting can be, it cuts ahead to present day where Discount Dane DeHaan (Douglas Smith), his Boring-Ass Girlfriend (Cressida Bonas), and Token Black Guy (Lucien Laviscount) rent out some old McMansion that's way out of the price range of a few college kids, and then they start getting terrorized by a vague antagonist that rips off everything from Freddy Kruger to Candyman as well as pretty much anything else you can imagine. That's pretty much it. For all intents and purposes, nothing could have happened at all, because the movie is utterly pointless, as are the cardboard caricatures that populate the movie. It's directed by Stacy Title and based off of a script by her husband, Jonathan Penner, and if I were to describe The Bye Bye Man in one word, it would be \"flat\": flat acting from people with zero charisma; flat cinematography that looks like it was shot on an iPhone and then desaturated; flat writing that's so clich\u00e9d and predictable that it borders on dramatic irony throughout; flat \"horror\" scenes, a few of which feature people getting shot or beaten with there's no blood in order to secure a PG-13 rating; flat CG that looks like it's from a '90s TV show. All of the actors' behavior makes it impossible to believe what's supposed to be happening, and it's an extra punch to the groin that this dialogue is so bad that not even great actors could make it work. Everyone speaks in one language, and that language is exposition. The kicker is that it's just so boring, so much so that I don't know why I'm even bothering to write more of this review. It doesn't deserve any more of my time; I've granted it far too much. Some of the worst movies that I've ever seen bring me to a point of insatiable rage, meaning that they are, in a weird way, effective. The Bye Bye Man isn't that. There are no highs and no lows. It's just... there. Barely. 1.8/10, disastrous, D-, leagues below average, etc.",
