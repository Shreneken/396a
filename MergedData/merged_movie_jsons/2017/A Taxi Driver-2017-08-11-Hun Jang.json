Incredible and inspiring the lengths people will go to for freedom and fairness.

            "content": "Movie: A Taxi Driver (15)Rating: 5/5I've been highly impressed long time by Song Kang-ho, and I've been watching many of his movies since later few months. I was highly excited to watch his new historical action drama A TAXI DRIVER, because the trailer was highly impressive. It showed how the film would turn out to be. I just wanted to see it as soon as possible and I finally got the opportunity. A TAXI DRIVER, without a second thought, is the best South Korean film I've seen till date. From narration to execution to performances to presentation: it's perfect in each and every aspect. The change in the tone of the film has been brought up extremely well, thanks to its director Jang Hoon. The screenplay is never disappointing throughout, and the film comes out as both a refreshing as well as a memorable experience. The film's editing is top notch as it doesn't take much of time to introduce and set up the characters as well as the storyline. As the film progresses, you find yourself connected to the characters, especially the ones of Song Kang-ho and Thomas Kretschmann. Both actors have delivered extremely excellent performances, and rather so excellent that I ended up rooting for them completely. When they smiled, I smiled. When they cried, I cried too. Rest of the supporting cast, especially Ryu Jun-yeol and Yu Hae-jin deserve a lot of praise. The film's technical aspects are top notch. The visuals are breathtaking and the story is well captured by a first-rate cinematography. The film's action sequences are another major highlight, as they induce a lot of excitement along with tension as to what would happen next. The film's not extremely violent, and thus I recommend you to watch it with your family. There's no vulgarity or obscenity in this film.There are plenty of emotional sequences which make the film a totally unforgettable experience. Watch the film and you won't find it difficult to guess which scenes I'm talking about. Various emotional, thrilling as well as action packed sequences have been elevated by the brilliant music. A TAXI DRIVER is a hard-hitting film which must be seen not just for its overall excellence but also for the message it delivers to its viewers. It's hard and almost impossible to forget the film, as you're left highly emotional & impressed by the time the credits start to roll. In short, a perfect masterpiece from South Korea!",

            "content": "A TAXI DRIVER is an excellent depiction of a notorious event in South Korean history, namely the Gwangju massacre of 1980. What makes this production so special is the direction, which is exemplary, and the scripting, which brings to life realistic characters in a way that's really encouraging and true-to-life. Song Kang-ho is one of those stars who's never delivered a poor performance and this is the best I've seen him; he adopts a masterful, multi-layered and intensely likeable role of an impoverished taxi driver drawn into a bizarre and uniquely dangerous situation. Thomas Kretschmann is decent too, but make no mistake, this is Kang-ho's film and he's a marvel. The movie itself is lengthy and often slowly-paced, but it keeps you engaged just as much in the quieter and more reflective character scenes as well as through the drama and more explicit and horrific moments. It's just a great film all round.",

            "content": "1980. The movie starts harmless. A widowed taxi driver in Seoul struggling to make ends meet for himself and his little daughter. He more or less wants to do the right thing in a country where circumstances aren't all that well but you can live your life. The movie pulls a few heartstrings here and there but never too much. It is surprisingly tactful and the director wisely steps back from the story and lets good actors paint a picture of everyday life. Enter a German reporter who smells a good story after being tipped off by a BBC colleague who tells him that the generally tense situation in South Korea somehow got worse recently. He needs a driver and the taxi driver needs the money. It is a relation out of necessity and neither of them actually seem to take a liking to each other. Both soon have to come to terms with the fact that they put themselves into a situation which has great relevance to their country and their professions. Turning away just isn't possible. \"Doing the right thing\" means that an average person has to find extraordinary courage. I have to commend the director and his actors for this eyewitness feeling. It is almost like you're another passenger sitting in that little taxi. You don't watch a movie but you are actually there as it happens. The fact that I was largely ignorant of those events in history makes this movie even more significant. The end result is a movie which is well-directed, with competent acting and impressive camera work. I had very little to criticize but a lot to think about when I left the show and that -to me- often is the sign of a truly good movie. Go see it!",

He travels to a region in riot, witnessing horrors and tragedies he could not have imagined.\"A Taxi Driver\" starts off comedic, as the taxi driver uses every way to make ends meet. As the scenes of riot unfolds, the film intensely engages my attention. The senseless massacre of civilians is very sad. It is a very powerful story that will drive anyone to tears. This is a story of a man with little heroic virtues unleashes his true self, and become a nameless hero. The fact that the journalist was unable to track the taxi driver down was particularly powerful. This film is as good as people say it is, and more.",

To be perfectly honest, I was not aware of the tragic events at the protests in South Korea in 1980. The complete disregard for human life will send shivers down your spine. It is impossible to understand why humanity never learns anything from its darkest mistakes. Throughout the history, similar things have happened and will unfortunately continue to happen in the future for sure. The story of the two main characters is inspiring. They risked their lives to bring truth to the world. You really get to care and root for them until the end. The acting is top-notch; wonderful, natural performances from everyone. And if you are an emotional person, the ending will definitely bring tears to your eyes. Strongly recommended.",

This movie went under the radar, I don't know why. Easily put it among the top 10 films made by Korean cinema. It is far from what we are used to, the thrillers, the serial killers, the revenge sagas, scenes with hand-to-hand combat. . .but, without a doubt, it is the best that Korea has brought out. A film that touches everything, goes from comedy, to drama, to action, to suspense in a matter of minutes. In the end, a masterpiece of the impact journalism has in discovering atrocities, when it is exercised in the right way, but more, a masterpiece in terms of showing tremendous friendship, one that develops in a short time, but lasts for lifetime.

            "review_title": "Definitely worthy to watch",
            "content": "Not a native English speaker, please forgive me some errors in English.I was a 5th grade living in Cheonju, Korea which is north about 50 miles from Gwangju when the massacre took place in May 1980. I still remember that full loaded paratroopers holding an M-16 rifle dispatched every corner of the streets in my home city, guarding during the period of the Gwangju outbreak, because Choneju was the major big city right next to Gwangju. They looked physically tired and gruesomely cold to the eyes of a 5th grade kid. My mother asked me and my younger brother not to go out of the house. My uncle who had business trip to a local office in Gwangju came by us briefly and went back to Seoul. He was so frightened telling us to prepare for some food and necessities for possible war situation. As a person who used to live in Cheola province in 1980, I can hardly see the photos of 80's in Gwangju without coming to tears. My review of the movie may be biased in some extent. Not long before Gwangju's uprising, president Park Chung-hee was assassinated at the dinner table by one of his close cabinet staffs, the head of the Korea central Intelligent agency. In this political turmoil a military general, Chun, Doo-hwan led a cop d' Etat to seize the political power and imposed martial law throughout Korea to prevent from the democratic movements. People especially college students protested against Chun, Doo-hwan asking democracy for Korea. Gwangju was one the cities where the student's demonstrations took places in May 1980.This movie does not really go into the details of the civilian killings and the whole facts of the atrocities done by the military troops which have been known later. Some people criticized that the lack of the realities and facts is the limit of this movie, which is the same limit that has been shown from other Korean films on Gwangju democratizing movement. However, I think that it was director's (Jang Hun) intention to show that way. Since the phone and all the communication methods were all disconnected, even people living in Gwangju who was so isolated may not have had full view of what I was happening. It must have been so confusing and disturbing to believe that broad ranges of the ordinary people living in Gwangju were brutally abused and became the targets to be killed by highly trained the military troops whose job is actually to protect its very own people. Wishfully magic and miracles should have taken places for the sake of the people in Gwangju. However, it is always too painful to acknowledge the fact that the bullets left the lethal rifles exactly follow the physics penetrating thin late spring clothes they wore and tearing the flesh and bones. The movie shows that the paratroopers in the front line firing the bullets in the kneeling posture. Many witnesses for Gwangju say the same thing that paratroopers aimed the civilians on the streets and shot at them. It is so outrageous and disgusting to hear the statements of Chun, Doo-hwan that he was not responsible for ordering to fire and simply denied it, even he said that he is a victim of Gwangju as well. Who would have ordered it then? The movie successfully shows that even politically indifferent Man-seob is voluntarily involved in coming back to the chaos because it is not a matter of the political viewpoints anymore, but it is matter of following his conscience or not. It may be his way to response to the sacrifice of the college kid, You J-Y. After the commotion in Gwanju, Man-seob was finally set to be free leaving Gwangju with helps from other local taxi drivers. As soon as arrived in Suncheon which is 32 mile from Gwangju, Man-seob orders a noodle while his car is being fixed. He overhears from people saying about what is going on in Gwangju and realizes how they are deceived by media completely controlled by the government. Furthermore he is given a Ju-muk-bob for free which tastes the same of it that tossed to him by a woman on the streets in Gwangju. Driving back to Seoul alone, he is singing a song and at same time slowly sheds tears. He decides to follow his conscience to go back Gwangju however it could cost of his life. His only family member, his daughter would become an orphan by his choice. This movie with Song Kang-ho's excellent acting makes it perfect to feel his agony and hesitations as an ordinary might have in his shoes.This move was made in the period of Park's administration. Artists, actors, writers, performers etc. who lobbed a wrong way against the government were secretively chosen to be listed so called the black lists. In spite of the atmosphere, the movie was made by brave people that I really appreciate those Korean actors, director, staffs and those who participated in the movies, as well as the role of German reporter, Thomas Kretschmann.",

Moreover, \"A Taxi Driver\" also succeeds in character development. The audience can also feel the sorrow delivered by the movie, largely thanks to the stellar performance of Song Kang-ho. Thomas Kretschmann, Yoo Hae-jin and Ryu Jun-yeol give decent acting as well. There are some plot holes, however. Why does the soldier let Kim and Peter through when he learns their true identities?

You watch a film and then go look deeper into the story to find out the facts. The whole thing cannot be encapsulated in 2-3 hours. With A TAXI DRIVER I learned about a rough period in the history of South Korea aside from the Korean War.It's May 1980 and independent taxi driver Kim Man-seob (Song Kang-ho) is doing his best to get along. Raising his daughter alone he has to chastise her for fighting with the landlord's son, a woman he still owes back rent to. As he heads out to try and make as much as he can the next day he's downhearted but hopes for the best.A chance to make more than he's ever made and get himself out of debt arises when he hears of a journalist wanting transportation from Seoul to Gwangju and back. All Kim sees is the money involved and with no knowledge of what is happening in Gwangju he sets out to steal the fare from a cab service. He picks up the journalist, J\u00fcrgen \"Peter\" Hinzpeter (Thomas Kretschmann), and off they go. Their first hint that something is amiss comes when they find troops blocking the road entering the city and are told to turn back. Peter knows there is rioting in the streets taking place, his reason for going there. Kim, focused only on his personal issues has no way of knowing what's taking place. With that in mind he agrees to find a way to get Peter into the city and they take a back road. Eventually they do get into the city and Peter pays Kim part of the money. As they make their way through the streets they see the rioting going on with students and workers uniting in protest against the government. From a rooftop location they watch as the protesters are brutally beaten and some shot. All the while the government reports that protesters are few and casualties are minor. Kim urges Peter for them to return to Seoul but Peter is intent on capturing the truth on film to show the world. The meet some of the protesters who take them in and offer to help repair Kim's taxi. He and Peter get to know the people for who they really are, people willing to share what little they have with them in the hopes that their story will come out. What happens the next day unites the two men as the world they once knew is completely shattered.What makes this film even more amazing is to learn that it is based on reality. Not just due to the story of these two men but to imagine the amount of brutality and murder that was going on at the time. The historical even taking place is known as the Gwangju Democratization Movement of 1980. And rather than low numbers being killed it was reported that over 606 people died during the demonstrations. The movie involves the viewers by seeing the events through the eyes of Kim. A simple man, a widower who wants nothing more than the best for his daughter, he sees his entire world change in a two days. Even though speaking in a different language actor Song Kang-ho pulls off an amazing performance here conveying the turmoil Kim finds himself in through his movements, actions and facial expressions. Thomas Kretschmann does a fine job as well but his determined journalist whose sole focus is the story can grate on you while watching. It isn't until he too realizes the danger the two of them are in that he becomes a move sympathetic character. I'm guessing that few will know the story being told here but once you finish watching you aren't likely to forget it. The film was chosen to represent South Korea as best foreign film at the Oscars but was withdrawn for some reason. That didn't stop it from being the second highest grossing film there that year. I can't recommend this movie enough, a chance to see another part of the world and what took place there through different eyes, something that can only be done via film.",

At first a lighthearted movie, both our characters and the viewer are unwittingly drawn into the tragic events that happened in Gwangju. Our taxi driver is funny and extremely relatable, whether it's when he's being late to pay his rent, cracking jokes with friends, ignoring far-off protests, or prioritizing his only daughter. But as he is forced into situations that violate his basic sense of humanity, it shocks him and all of us to our core.

This film begs the question of credibility in what the government tells it's people.While traveling in South Korea, I practically stumbled across the memorial in Gwang-ju, and was amazed to find that it happened so recently. Young people NEED to know that stuff like this still happens, that it's not simply dates we read about in \"ancient\" history. Please do not let the gore and brutality of the film deter you from watching. It is that way for a reason. The reality of our world is bloody and cruel, but this film also gives us a glimpse of hope; that there are some willing to give there lives for a just cause, and through the perspective of these characters, we are carried through an amazingly heartfelt film-watching experience.",

Not surprisingly the film was banned in China. This is a rewarding and interesting film that will prompt the viewer to find out more about this dark history in modern South Korea.

He manages to grab another taxi drivers customer and sneak him into Gwangju while being unsuspecting of any trouble from his government. Confronted by the intense brutality is the closed off region Song Kang-ho is forced to wrestle with running home where he can protect his daughter or staying to help the reporter get the truth out. Despite this being a movie that will have a deep emotional impact there's a good balance of relief moments of hope and comedy throughout the film. I'm giving this movie a 10/10 vote as I believe it deserves a much higher score than it has and it probably getting voted down simply because \"it's Korean and I don't understand it\". Fully recommend spending your time and money on seeing this great piece of Korean cinema.",

A Taxi Driver reveals such a story that took place in South Korea in 1980: the times of mass pro-democratic demonstrations against an oppressive military regime. The film portrays a couple of days from that period happening in a Korean city Gwangju, which was cut off from the rest of the country by army because of the student resistance. An ordinary taxi driver from Seoul coincidentally becomes the hero of this story: he is hired to transport a German journalist right into the hot spot of Gwangju and is compelled to witness plenty of violence against the student peaceful protests.To be honest, the entire historical background came up as a sheer revelation to me: the portrayed events contradict to the modern free South Korea's image everybody knows today. Thus, the movie serves an imperative educational purpose introducing the historical events to its spectators in a highly emotional, engrossing and comprehensible language.Additionally, the way ordinary Koreans are shown is very appealing: even secondary characters are played lively and appear extremely convincing and well-developed.All in all, A Taxi Driver seems a great choice for those willing to have a peek at a distinct darker page of South Korea and engage in realistic and moving drama of its ordinary citizens' lives from that historical period.",

            "content": "Jang Hun studies the dynamic of Kim Man-Seob (Kang-ho Song) and J\u00fcrgen Hinzpeter (Thomas Kretschmann) in his film A Taxi Driver (2017) which unfolds in a neglected and unkempt Gwangju in the 1980s. A hefty and charismatic performance from Kang-ho Song is profoundly important in this film, a film in which, despite its many flaws, thrives on its character development and technical triumphs to create a conclusively delectable watch.\nWe are in South Korea in the 1980s, as an uprising takes place in Gwangju, which the general population of South Korea is oblivious to and uninformed about. We are introduced to a taxi driver by the name of Kim Man-Seob, living in Seoul, who juggles his problems one at a time, struggling to pay his rent and to keep his daughter pleased. When eating lunch at a canteen, he overhears a topic of conversation between two other taxi drivers, about a German willing to pay 100,000 won to drive him to Gwangju, deaf to the mutiny taking place in Gwangju, Kim strikes up a plan to steal this client. The German, is a journalist by the name of J\u00fcrgen Hinzpeter, due to the restrictions implemented by the government, J\u00fcrgen pretends to be a Christian missionary. After being picked up by Kim, they leave for Gwangju. After an altercation with government troops, Kim and J\u00fcrgen get into Gwangju, rampage ensues, as we follow these two characters in the Gwangju uprising, and their struggle to document, escape and help Gwangju.\nJang Hun manipulates the audience into instantly sympathizing with Kim Man-Seob when developing his background, Jang Hun inserts exposition explaining why we should commiserate with Kim. Kang-Ho Song delivers an impeccable performance that eclipses the other performances. Kang-Ho Song, who has already established himself as a luminous, grade-A actor, has once again proven the degree wherein his acting can go to.\nDespite the film being based on the Gwangju uprising, the Director took it upon himself to change the story, most likely to make the story more cinematic and commercial. Jang Hun over exaggerates certain character motives and actions. Irrational behaviour and the consistency of a character's persona throughout the film shapes a supposition that it was lazily written. Riddled with discernable cliches and glaring plot holes, the writing seems to focus only on developing Kim, and doesn't develop J\u00fcrgen. Often this wouldn't be an issue, but given the amount of screen time the character receives, it is unfair for the audience to be unable to relate and sympathize with him. Side characters such as Gu Jae-sik and Hwang Tae-sul are better developed than J\u00fcrgen.\nThe film has outstanding production design by Yi-jin Jeong, who creates monumental period cityscape images of Gwangju and encapsulates the feeling of 1980 Gwangju faultlessly. The film is well-paced, thanks to the quick-cut editing from Jae-beom Kim and Sang-beom Kim. The tonal shifts throughout could've come across as jarring, but due to the skilful editing, the tonal shifts are smooth. The quick pacing fit the story well, as the story was anxiety-inducing. The music score, composed by Young-wook Jo accentuates this anxious feeling throughout the film, and it is extremely commendable what a sensational job he has done. He has created built up instrumentals that offer an everlasting apprehensive experience for the audience.\nThe cinematography throughout is noticeably innovative, beautifully constructed camera movements, inventive dialogue shots, and brilliantly justified hand-held shots. The cinematography compliments the lighting, as they come hand in hand. The lighting subconsciously brings out angst. The film is often gorgeously lit and utilizes natural light flawlessly. The niche colour palette is bright and vibrant which clashes in contrast to the harsh subject matter emphasizes the hope and faith of the character's we are following. The frame composition is expertly done and occasionally helps carry the story on visually.\nJang Hun has dealt with the subject matter competently, where it is safe and inoffensive, he's directed a technically-innovative film, in specific regards to the impeccably shot action sequences. The film fails on a story-telling front, often melodramatic and riddled with painstaking cliches, as well as has multiple plot devices to give an excuse to some of the ridiculous plotlines. It is easy to overlook these issues due to the sheer effort and talent behind this film. Predominantly enjoyable, A Taxi Driver is often unrealistic in what we see on screen but does just enough for a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",

The filmmakers tried to identify Kim Sa-bok prior to the production, but only after the films release it has surfaced that the man had died of cancer in 1984, four years after the events in the film. Knowing nearly nothing about the driver, the filmmaker tried their best to create an intruiging character, that fit the movie. The actor Song Kang-ho as well as his german counterpart Thomas Kretschmann both did great jobs and I liked their performances.\nThe screenplay/plot is not too bad, it does a good job being both entertaining and sometimes even light-hearted, as well as handling the though and serious topic of the gwangju uprising very well. However the pacing of the movie isn't absolutely great, with the rythm of the film sometimes a bit off, so it could have also been a little shorter than 135 min. Another problem was, that although I know about the history, for me personally this tragedy hasn't been translated well enough onto the movie. Objectively they handeled the tragedy well, but I was left a little bit cold. That being said I did enjoy the film and would rate it 7.5 if i could.",

            "content": "When governments are tyrannical, the first thing they do is limit or eradicate the free press so no one can hold them accountable and replace it with their own \"real\" news. The Taxi Driver is a drama based on such a clandestine event that marked South Korea in 1980\u2013 the Gwangju Uprising, also known as the May 18 Democratic Uprising, and/or, the Gwangju Democratization Movement. The regime not only banned reporting and barred reporters, it actively shut down media and hunted them so that no news of the event would reach outside the seized city limits. But, any way you slice it, it did happened, and only one reporter was able to document it and show it to the world. Director Jang Hoon tells a story based on German reporter J\u00fcrgen Hinzpeter, known as Peter, as he infiltrated the massacre that took place in the days of May 18-20 in Gwangju, South Korea, with the help of Kim Man-seob, a taxi driver from Seoul.Peter is played by Thomas Kretschmann who, interestingly, cites his experience escaping East Germany in his early 20s as a giving him a crucial understanding to be able to deliver on his interpretation of Peter. The title character of Mr. Kim is played by Kang-ho Song who has a robust career in both theater and film. The role of the taxi driver is not only moving but also demanding since his character is the focus of the film and serves as the vehicle for the dramatization of the historical event. The character of Kim is symbolic of the everyday person living at the time who has a choice to look away or risk his or safety and bear witness to the massacre.Jang Hoon's vision is focused and his delivery is compelling. While the story praises the courage of Peter to tell the story of a massacre that would have otherwise been swept under the rug, the heart of the story is in Mr. Kim's personal transformation. In Spanish the phrase, \"hacer conciencia\" is often translated into English as \"to raise awareness\" but conceptually it is very different than to simply make someone aware, or give them information they lacked. The phrase in Spanish is far more active and intentional. It may rest on the Shakespearean idea that humans are the paragon of animals, but animals nevertheless; to \"hacer conciencia\" is to make or create a conscience, thus implying an intellectual and emotional growth that comes with experience and compassion and from which there is no turning back. Mr. Kim's transformation is the active transformation of a people as each of them \"make conscience\" and sacrifice their lives for the hope of democracy. Through the character of Mr. Kim, Hoon balances a lighter side of existence with the stress and suffering that lives just under the surface. The balance is nicely bookended by small details that surface throughout like the memory of a food or the bow tied y Mr. Kim, first in his daughter's hair, and later on a box of cookies. The balance between Peter and the event is also well proportioned, with Peter often being the character in the background, thus keeping the focus on the people of South Korea. Mr. Hoon's inclusion of footage of the real J\u00fcrgen Hinzpeter in the end is both a loving gesture, and a note of gratitude because in the end, The Washington Post is right, \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" when atrocities happen because no one is watching.",

            "content": "The DIALOG, man. What made us not easy to enjoy the Korean movies or the TV drama series, no matter how popular they are, is the stupid dialog. It's not the normal dialogs that we usually see in the Western movies, the dialog in Korean movies or drama series are not dialog between two characters or among several actors, but a monologue, a single person keeps talking to himself or herself, and such monologue is widely used to show those thoughts usually flow in one's brain. But Korean movies and TV dramas use such stupid monologue, a self-talking-to-himself(herself) to let the viewers, who in the eyes of the screenplay writers and the directors usually think the viewers are too stupid to understand what the characters in the movie or TV dramas are thinking. So most of the time in a Korean movie ( the Japanese movies and TV dramas also got such problem, but not as serious as the Korean's), talking non-stop to him(her)self, a monologue only mentally ill or born retarded, become the never-can-get-rid-of, must-have, even in self doubt scene so popularly used. A dialog helps the viewers to understand the on-going of the storyline, the coming-up or developing scenarios or plots, but use monologue of one person keeps talking to himself or herself is just stupid and unnatural. When people start talking to himself or herself, it's a popular sign and common sense that the person who talk or murmuring to himself(herself) is reaching a deteriorating mental condition, he or she uses the mouth to carry out the thoughts in their mind or brain. It's a common symptom of aging problem. People under age 45 usually would not have such self-murmuring problem unless a mentally deterioration is underway. But the Korean movies and TV dramas both pushing the uncontrollable talking to himself or herself a common habit to all the Koreans, no matter young or old, male or female, they all put their thoughts, their thinking in their mouths and blabbering out non-stop. If the Koreans got such talk-to-themselves problems when they are still young, even at teenage, I just could not imagine how such problem would become how serious when they become older and older. We often saw some people talking to themselves in a supermarket or in the street, and we'd automatically consider them either too old or with mental problems, but not the Koreans, especially the Koreans in a Korean movie or TV drama, because to the Korean people, the monologue is indeed the dialog.We've seen so many good Korean movies and TV drama series, almost all of them got such ridiculous talking-to-himself or herself. Dialog is a conversation, not a monologue, consciously, sub-consciously or unconsciously to show one's thoughts by mouth.",

            "content": "\"Taeksi woonjunsa\" or \"A Taxi Driver\" is a Korean movie that is mostly in the Korean language as well, even if due to the international component to this film and story, we also get a bit of English, German and Japanese. English should probably be mentioned before German on the imdb page if we look at the frequency of foreign languages included here. The film is from 2017, so it has its fifth anniversary this year and it was shown (but not really on the occasion of this anniversary) again on the big screen yesterday and I took the chance to see it. I did not regret going one bit, it is a quite mesmerizing movie and I am glad they are bringing some Asian films back to cinemas these days here and if you get a similar chance, then do not miss out or otherwise also watch at home simple. The film is worth it. At considerably over two hours, it is not a short film, actually it is even closer to 2.5 hours if we count credits, but it deserved the duration and I am glad they were not forced to keep it shorter or so. The director is Hun Jang who is not super famous compared to some other of the most defining Korean filmmakers these days, but he is also enjoying a solid career. He is also not old. He launched his career around 2007, had 5 prolific years then and then took a bit of a break until he returned with this film for his kinda tenth career anniversary. I am glad he did and I am sure so is he because this became his most known film so far and also most successful awards-wise. You can check the attention it received for yourself if you want, but one thing that deserves being mentioned is that the movie was chosen by South Korea to get submitted to the Oscars. Unfortunately, there it did not get the attention it deserves. The writer is Yu-na Eom and there is, according to imdb, no other work on this person's body of work before this film, so it was quite a successful way to launch the career. Now there is another credit and this newer film also features Hae-Jin Yoo, one of the cast members from this movie we have here that had more than just a few seconds screen time.This one here is a film that seemed initially much lighter than it turned out to be. Just look at the examples of language barriers, the way the title character finds out about the surely most defining ride of his life or also the rent/money issues. There was one funny scene for example relatively early when we have the main character drive a pregnant woman and her man and he is mad initially that the man does not find his money, but then he gives him his card and says he will pay double the next day if he calls him and the main character's reaction there was quite hilarious and something that not everybody in the audience spotted right away. Or also the scene when he eats with his daughter and how he reacts when he finds out where the food is from - another funny moment. But there are also more serious aspects to the title character from the very start. We find out about his deceased wife and that he is a single dad now, we find out he has a military background himself and this is why he sides with the military initially and is also really mad at the protesters before the story really encourages and forces him to reconsider his viewpoint. Of course, the second half then with pretty much all the slaughtering going on, it is a really dramatic movie and nothing else. Very shocking sequences there. For me personally, the film was also interesting because of the inclusion of Kretschmer here as I am from Germany myself, even if he would always play second fiddle to Song Kang-ho and I am glad he has enjoyed a huge breakthrough, also internationally, in recent years. He nailed his scenes 100% all the time, no matter if we are talking the lighter material or the more serious moments. The real gravity of the situation he maybe does not fully understand until the moment when their young aspiring musician friend has a gun to his head. Before that, there was also a scene already in which everybody except him kinda understood, namely when he is just sitting there eating some of the food a lady gave him (very pretty lady/actress by the way in this one-scene performance) before when they were driving to where they filmed from the rooftop.Speaking of the music friend I just mentioned, it was a bit expected that tragic fate was coming his way when we find out about his dream and then a little later we see the corpse. There the filmmaker or writer was playing a bit with us as we hear his voice and realize he did not get shot right away, but this scene with the gun to his head was really maybe the most dramatic moment of the entire film when the bad guy counts to ten. All that happened afterwards was very dramatic too, like when we see people who try to pull the corpses away getting shot in cold blood. Terrible massacre there and it is a bit difficult to imagine that this happened in South Korea, a country that nowadays is really as western as it gets and the opposite to North Korea where you cannot totally rule out similar stuff happening again now 40 years later. There were time stamps to this film. This was also when I thought of Hinzpeter, the man portrayed by Kretschmer here. He came from a separated country at that point and he entered another one. This character's best scenes were really when the title character was out of the picture. How he was bored of Japan. His only comedic moment was when he ate spicy food and underestimated it. This was a funny scene because there they were also mocking the guitar player a bit because he was not a good singer. But yeah, of course also the speech from the then old German character in which he reaches out to his Korean friend one last time was touching and memorable and also the recordings of the real Hinzpeter (almost sounds like a German first name / double name) at the very, very end in which he says the same again. Sadly, Hinzpeter died in 2016 at almost 80, so a little while before this film got released to the public and he also did not find out anymore what a success it turned into. A bit sad.I checked back and now I saw that apparently they managed to identify the real taxi driver from back then and he was a man who already died from cancer approximately five years after the events there took place. This is even sadder, so there was no real chance for Hinzpeter to meet him again for pretty much the entire time he tried. But at least they found him. Through his son that is. A son is not featured in the film at all, there we only find out about the daughter. On quite a few occasions. But probably the actual taxi driver also had a daughter. I am sure a lot we see here was based on Hinzpeter's memory from back then. But a lot was also fictionalized. I think they could have included more interesting parts like for example showing us the daughter as a grown-up then or could have done something with these pretty pink shoes, but on the other hand it makes sense because towards the end, we do not find out about the main character at all except that we see him briefly in his car again doing his job. Definitely a lot about him was also fictionalized here, but I liked the inclusions of Korean and German television and the news they provided to people. I also found the old camera the German used really interesting with what was written on it for example or the cookie box reference at the very end as well or the idea how he leaves early to make sure the government won't manage to catch him when he is about to get on the plane. Of course, I am never sure how much there was added for dramatic reasons and how much actually happened this way, but I feel like the Hinzpeter references should at least be accurate as he could tell everybody what it was like. I have to dig deep here to find stuff that I did not like too much. Some of it had to do with the other taxi drivers and their contribution, like for example when these taxis formed a barricade to make sure the soldiers could no longer randomly shoot people. That was okay, but not as impactful as they intended, a bit absurd too.Even more absurd was maybe the idea then that the taxi drivers came out of nowhere almost at the end to help the two key players and get the military cars to focus on them instead. Which they succeeded with, but it came with a high price. I like the shot when the camera keeps moving and one stays behind, loses his life there. One thing I found surprising was that the main character really gave a wrong name and number there apparently to Hinzpeter. I am not sure why. For safety reasons, to protect himself? In other scenes, we see how the title character here and there enjoys the attention and his attempts at pretending he isn't flatted were only half-baked. So why was he there in the end not ready to become a hero? We will maybe never know the answer. Maybe the man was also entirely different than what we see here in the film. We will never know, but it is good that this film was made in his honor and also for the memory of those that lost their lives during this brutal massacre. I really enjoyed the movie as you can see from my rating. I realized pretty quickly that this could turn into one of my favorite films from its year and I had a feeling this would get 4 stars out of 5 and so it came. In-between, there were segments when I thought maybe 4 is a bit too much and 3 is enough and towards the end I actually leaned more towards a perfect rating, also with the scene in which one kind-spirited soldier lies about what is in the trunk. It was really touching and brilliant in the last 20-30 minutes, so the middle way feels right and who knows maybe I will give a higher rating on rewatch one day. In any case, I am glad this film got seen by many by now and I hope it will also return on a few more occasions to the big screen, here and wherever you live. In my opinion, this movie is the better Taxi Driver from the two out there. Sorry Marty! Highly recommended.",

            "content": "The setup to this improbable (but loosely real-life) story has a poor taxi driver unwittingly leaping at the chance to take a foreigner hundreds of kilometers from Seoul to Gwangju in May, 1980. He's a widower who is four months behind on his rent and is driving a car that is long overdue for major servicing, but still manages a degree of buoyancy in his attitude, making for a likeable protagonist. His fare is a German journalist posing as a businessman to get footage of the student protests against martial law in Gwangju, which would of course soon turn bloody. The pair struggle to communicate, and aren't on the same page at all as to the wisdom of attempting to drive into a restricted zone, with the government resorting to violence and murder to quash the uprising and anyone attempting to report on it.The taxi driver's initial views are along the lines that the students shouldn't be out there protesting, that they should appreciate their country as he does, after having spent five years in Saudi Arabia. The arc that his character takes as he gradually gets sucked in to witnessing a massacre, at each step trying to resist involvement and to remain safe, is fantastic. The cinematography of these moments is haunting, and the emotional power of the events is strong. Director Jang Hoon also manages to weave in human elements, and I liked the glimpses into the values of hospitality, humility, and camaraderie.Where the film lost points for me was in how the story was embellished. Granted, the backstory of the taxi driver needed to be created because his identity wasn't known at the time the film was made, but the crux of the story was so important and incredible that I thought it needed no further adornment. That started with extra moments of melodrama, where the taxi driver left and returned more than once, and culminated in some frankly ridiculous moments where a squadron of taxis heroically joined the fight, with many drivers sacrificing themselves. It fit thematically with the sacrifice the real-life students made in giving their lives to protest for democracy at Gwangju, but threatened to make a cartoonish, Hollywood action film out of those events.Overall though, I liked seeing the depiction of the Gwangju uprising, thought Song Kang-ho did well in the role of the taxi driver, and found the story touching. Definitely worth seeing.",

Brutally realistic at times, the story shows how a group of taxi drivers are instrumental in getting this story recorded so it can be shown to the world. Man-seob (SONG Kang-ho), (the Seoul driver responsible for initially taking the reporter to Gwangju) goes from only being concerned with his own life and safety to that of a hero. The massacre that takes place both during and after the attempted protest is difficult but necessary to the story and the last 45 minutes or so of this movie will have you on the edge of your seat as you see the sacrifices made to get the film footage out of the city.",

Both the reporter and taxi driver does not share common political grounds.If you like political dramas you can do alot worse, but also a little better, this is however an important history and deserves a viewing, it is well made and I do recommend watching it.Cineamtographically speaking there is not much new, there are some REALLY nice shots though; as the ones on the roof of the spectators of the military violence and the shots when people march united and the persons there.There are also some smoke shots that were obviously supposed to be more war'esque but ended up with smoke completely blocking the shots, which in my opinion even though wasting some nice shots worked better with the storyline.The pacing is a little off sometimes and some moments feel forced. But overall it retains the thrill momentum and emotional high which means my heart kept pumping and emotions shining through.Pro's\nThe moral backbone of all participants (black listing probable)\nThe importance of history (a would have been another paranoid disillusion if the news didnt get out)\nEffects and goreCon's\nSome of the acting, mostly good though\nSome of the editing and dragging some moments out for thrill momentum\nUnclear on numbers dead etc - which should have surfaced after the eventEnd notes (spoiler and political info below):\nGwanghwamun (the location of the last ride is a white royal palace gate (the largest), white in asian cinematography (atleast chinese) is to denote heaven, which would explain what really happened to Kim Man-seob after making it out.In the end the humane angle, seing normative structures of fascism in action makes the right wing taxi driver see reality through a realistic perspective and connect to his fellow humans. A good key.Something strange is that Japan is considered a safe harbour, even though their economy is built off milton-friedman (forever increasing debt - controlled by those who own the debt) and not keynes (stable economy, smaller swings in the national economic cycle) and should be closer to the fascism by relation and thus against the spread of information that hurts the veil that covers the global plutocracy. Though that is indeed easier with todays available technology than 1980's.Some of the emotional moments are moving and Kang-ho Song & Hae-Jin Yoo with a couple of small seeworthy supporting appearances that leave a mark.Sadly these facsist things happen even in nations that pre 2000's had managed to keep freedom (social democracy) alive like Sweden (these days more or less fully dismanteled public secotr by or overlords in USA, thus the organised crime, maniac teocrats and masons behind it - overlapping groups) - this can be easily induced by how much influnce EU top politicians had over TTiP (which is basically none) - thus denoting who's \"in charge\" (those who fill their currency with empty paper - the USA, CDO & release of new currency is a good place to start if u want to step through that open door and really enlighten urself).",

To his neighbors he is cheap, lazy and does not appear to be the best father or most reliable person. But our ignorant soon-to-be hero runs accidentally into a German journalist also well-acted by Thomas Kretschmann. The two make an unlikely pair that walks into an important chapter of Korean history and an important political statement for human beings today. In the grand sense, this film is about ordinary people rising collectively to a greater good. It is about truth, freedom of the press, and democracy. No wonder it was unbelievably popular in South Korea since it connects everyone to a real event. It is a film worth seeing, another Korean film gem. It's hard to give this either a 9 or 10 but it is among the best 25 historical films ever.",

The movie uses a good topic as the background, but the director didn't fully use this: superb performance of the main characters can not cover up the thin characterization, the portrayal of the whole movie is more like a symbolic pile-up than a portrait of a specific historical event - I can simply apply these to the similar historical event in China or any other events ever happened in this world.I've reflected about the soldiers, whether they've ever thought about what kind of faith/regime they are filially loyal to when they join the military? When I watched the movie, I always thought it was the work of a European or American director, and I was surprised by the censorship system in Korea that allowed the movie to be broadcast.Last but not least, this film truly let me understand how Western countries think about China.",

            "content": "A Taxi Driver is a film that is based on a true story, set placed in South Korea in Gwangju during the 1980s at the beginning of what we slowly unravel with Kim Man-seob (a Seoul taxi drive played by Song Kang-ho) who's unintentionally escorting Thomas Kretschmann (a reporter played by Jurgen Hinzpeter) to capture the bloody, hidden event to later known as the Gwangju Uprising.The narration danced between light-hearted and seriousness very well. Man-seob's beaten down, yet humorous attitude with questionable actions brought great range to the movie as his personality clashed with Kretschmann who's stoic and understands the importance of this serious moment. Like scenes of mistranslation where Man-seob should be the person that breaks the language barrier and helps the two parties communicate in a tense standoff, but instead only adds more confusion because of his lack of English that only leaves the audiences laughing and the only ones that know what's going on.As the historic event unfold and chaos erupted, the movie still snuck in tender moments of the people from Gwangju to humanize the tragedy and a somber reminder that this is based on a true story. And we are taken through this event with Man-seob as his morals are questioned, tested, and transformed as we both learn more about the Gwangju Uprising.The movie did a great job of balancing between the different genres: drama and history. So the only critic would be the forceful category of the action genre that felt out of place and seemed too melodramatic that I could have done without.Overall, A Taxi Drive is exactly why I love watching movies - to be entertained and learn something along the way. I wouldn't have stumble on this historic event of Korea if it wasn't for A Taxi Driver.",

On top of that the soundtrack for this movie is AWWWWWFFFFUUULLLL. You do not need to use loud strings and blaring music every time something important happens. For the love of god, let a viewer interpret a scene on their own without making the music convey what we're supposed to be feeling every time we watch it unfold. The music took me out of so many scenes and the chases/violence particularly when they were on the rooftops were so cliched it was laughable. If it wasn't for the sound acting, and some genuinely well done camera work, and pacing. If it wasn't for that, this movie would be much lower on my rating. It's vastly overrated by people here that don't seem to watch anything besides one foreign movie and think it's profound just because it has a message. Real shame because this had massive potential but it was so melo-dramatic to the core that it's hard to take serious just like another overrated pile of mess A Train to Busan but this was at least much better than that.",
