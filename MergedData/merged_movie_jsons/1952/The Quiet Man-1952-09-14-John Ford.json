            "content": "The filming of The Quiet Man was the culmination of a dream by John Ford to make an Irish picture in Ireland. He bought the rights to the story over a decade before and peddled it to every studio in Hollywood and was turned down.He went to Republic Pictures partly because John Wayne was just winding down his contract with them and he wouldn't have to pay him extra, and partly because Herbert J. Yates's small studio was the last stop. Ford got the permission for The Quiet Man on the condition he do a sure fire moneymaking John Wayne cavalry picture first. So Ford, Wayne, and Maureen O'Hara did Rio Grande first before setting out for Ireland.In her recent memoirs O'Hara said that this was her role of a lifetime, she knew it would be before one frame of film was shot. She'd been playing in a load of ridiculous Hollywood drivel films as a redheaded Bedouin princess and she did them essentially for the money. This one was to be a labor of love.Love yes, but a labor nonetheless. John Ford was a talented, but strange man to work for. He could be a bully and a tyrant on any set he was on. She was grateful to him for the career making roles she got with him, but recognized his faults. She relates in her memoirs that Ford used his influence to knock her out of an Oscar Nomination for Mary Kate Danaher in 1952 over some trivial offense Ford thought O'Hara committed and took umbrage.It was a family affair for Wayne of sorts as well. His kids came to Ireland with him and you can see them at the horse racing scene as extras. Young Patrick Wayne spoke his first movie lines. He also had with him his second wife, Esperanza Baur who was not his kid's mom. She was a tempestuous sort and they would soon part in a very ugly divorce.Sean Thornton who was born in Innisfree, but went to America as a toddler, has come back to his native Ireland after making a name for himself as a prizefighter and killing a man in the ring. He and Maureen O'Hara have an instant attraction for each other. However Wayne does run afoul of her bully of a brother, Squire Will Danaher played by Ford regular Victor McLaglen.Wayne and O'Hara marry, but McLaglen won't turn over the bride's dowry. And Wayne won't contest him for it.So with a little help from The Taming of the Shrew and a bit of Falstaff thrown in, things are put right in Innisfree. More I won't say. As in all of John Ford's films and this is one of the best, he got some grand performances from some of the most minute characters in the film. Some of his regulars like Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, Ken Curtis, Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields with the rest of the roles played by Dublin's acclaimed Abbey Theatre players. One of my favorites is Jack McGowran who played Feeney, Squire Danaher's little toady factotum. The music was arranged by Victor Young who did a grand job of using traditional Irish melodies in the score. One song, The Isle of Innisfree was recorded by Bing Crosby for Decca and sold a few platters for him the year The Quiet Man came out. The Quiet Man is an annual classic for St. Patrick's Day, the same way It's A Wonderful Life is for Christmas. At least in America it is. I've wondered if it is as well received in Ireland as it is here. I think John Ford, the former Sean O'Fearna, was hoping it would turn out that way.Mr. Ford, you got your wish.",

            "content": "The lush and beautiful countryside of Ireland provides the setting for this engaging tale of an Irishman, raised in America, going back home to escape a past he'd just as soon forget.  In `The Quiet Man,' director John Ford returns to his own roots, going on location to tell the story of Sean Thornton (John Wayne), a man troubled by an incident that changed his life, and now doing what he can to forget about it and just move on.  And toward that end, Sean travels to the place he knows so well from the stories told him by his mother, to Innisfree, intending to buy the cottage in which he was born, White O'Morn, where he can make a fresh start and build a new life for himself.  There's a problem, however; the land and the cottage is owned by the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick), and borders the estate of one Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen), who not only fancies the widow herself, but wants to buy her land.  Squire Danaher (as he's known) is not the only one Sean must deal with, though, as other matters arise upon his arrival in the small hamlet of his birth.  And her name is Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara)-- who just happens to be Squire Danaher's sister.  But Danaher or no, it makes no difference to Sean, who as soon as he lays eyes on Mary Kate determines to make her his wife.  \tSean soon learns that in Ireland, however, such things are pursued quite differently than in America.  To win the hand of Mary Kate he must employ the services of Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) a kind of matchmaker/chaperone/marriage broker, who will help him secure the consent of Squire Danaher, without which the marriage cannot and will not take place.  So Sean has no choice but to acquiesce to the local traditions and customs, and Michaleen forthwith commences the appropriate overtures.  In the meantime, he awaits the decision of the widow Tillane as to the purchase of White O'Morn, which he is determined to have at any cost.\tJohn Ford directed more than 140 motion pictures, going back to the days of silent films, and his favorite star, with whom he worked in at least a dozen of his feature films, was John Wayne.  And when you think of the John Ford/John Wayne collaborations, it's the Western that instantly comes to mind:  `Stagecoach,' `She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,' `Fort Apache,' `Rio Grande' or `The Searchers,' (to name a few).  Yet, `The Quiet Man' is perhaps their most memorable effort, and remains a favorite among fans to this day.  Ford (who received an Oscar for Best Director for it) presents the story on a very personal level, and in Sean and Mary Kate gives the audience characters to whom they can relate; and it's that personal connection he affords the viewer that may suggest the main reason behind this particular film's popularity.  That, plus the fact that at the core of this story there is an honesty and genuine sincerity that rings so true-to-life.  Ford also successfully captures the essence of all that is good and positive about Ireland, from the richness of all of his characters to the lavish cinematography that brings the country so vividly to life.  It's quite simply a wonderful, uplifting film, impeccably crafted and delivered by Ford and his superb cast.\tToo often, John Wayne's work gets a bad rap; no matter what role he takes on, you're liable to hear `John Wayne is always John Wayne, the only difference is the character's name.'  And, as he proves with his portrayal of Sean Thornton, it's not only a false statement, it's so unfair to an actor who brought so much to so many, in his craft as well as in his personal life.  The Oscar he finally received for 1969's `True Grit' was way overdue, especially when you consider his performances in such films as `The Searchers,' `Red River' and, of course, this one.  Is he the best actor of all time?  Of course not; but he is good at what he does, much better than he is usually given credit for.  And he (and his films) can always-- always-- be counted on to provide good, solid entertainment.  Together, he and Ford have provided some of the most memorable moments in the history of the movies, and his pairing with Maureen O'Hara was a stroke of genius. There's real chemistry between them, which enables them to play so well off of one another.  They made five films together between 1950 (`Rio Grande') and 1971 (`Big Jake'), and there is always that spark of magic between them, but never better than in this film.\tA gifted actor, Maureen O'Hara is also, without question, one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the silver screen.  It's easy to understand how Sean Thornton can fall instantly in love with her when he first sees her walking through the fields of Innisfree.  It's entirely believable.  And when you get to know the woman behind the beauty-- who Mary Kate is down deep-- it's even more understandable.  Perfectly cast, O'Hara, like Ford, returned to her roots to make this film (she was born in Milltown, Ireland, near Dublin), and apparently it agreed with her, because her performance is nothing less than natural and inspired.  Mary Kate Danaher, in fact, is arguably one of her-- if not `the'--  most memorable roles of her career.\tThe supporting cast, topped by Fitzgerald (who is absolutely unforgettable as Michaleen) also includes Ward Bond (Father Lonergan), Francis Ford (Dan Tobin), Arthur Shields (Reverend Playfair) and Jack MacGowran (Feeney).  A delightful and endearing motion picture, `The Quiet Man' is, of all of John Ford's achievements, one of his best.  And Sean, Mary Kate, Michaleen and all the people of Innisfree are ones you'll remember and want to visit again.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",

            "content": "Maureen O'Hara in Technicolor is surely any Irishman's dream, and \"The Quiet Man\" would be timeless for that alone. But O'Hara's performance is all the more indelible for the great good humor she bestows on her character, Mary Kate Danaher. Let's face it; with any other actress, this could have been a disaster.Sean Thornton (John Wayne) comes back to County Mayo, his birthplace, to find a peace he lost tragically back home in America. He immediately discovers some old friends, and a new one, too, Mary Kate, who while herding sheep stares back at him in what James Joyce might have called \"a significant manner.\"Director John Ford elects to shoot O'Hara from an odd angle, and with an unusual overhead shadow crossing O'Hara's face, that in anyone else's hands would have totally blown the shot but here creates something, well, \"Homerific.\" It's one of many amazing shots in a film that seems more painted than photographed, and is perhaps the most strikingly lovely film ever made.The shot of O'Hara looking back at Wayne also clues you onto something else, that this is going to be her story as much as it is Thornton's. In fact, it's really more about her than it is about him, a film about romance and a woman's liberation at the hands of her lover. We call them \"chick flicks\" today. But since John Wayne is the nominal star and no one ever confused Ford with Douglas Sirk, \"The Quiet Man\" isn't popularly regarded this way.It's fun to read all the comments about poor Mary Kate and how this film glamorizes the mistreatment of women. They have one thing right, it's a film about spousal domination, but it's the wife ruling the husband. Think about it: She makes her lover do just about everything he does in the film, even risk bodily injury at the hands of her brutish brother (she doesn't know about his past and thinks she married \"a coward.\") People complain that he drags her across a dung-covered field, while a helpful woman hands him a stick \"to beat the lovely lady with.\" But of course it's Mary Kate who's in total control of the situation. She wants Thornton to fight for her, in every sense of the word, and won't make it easy. She wants him to adapt to her culture, rather than adapt to his. (She's not one to be \"honked at,\" as she puts it.) It's not surprising she trips and falls at one point while Thornton pulls her across a field; probably one of those puppet strings of hers got in the way.But there are worse things in life than being enslaved by the likes of Maureen O'Hara, like not being enslaved by the likes of Maureen O'Hara. She's not only beautiful and pure-hearted, but such a hilarious joy to be around. O'Hara plays up the comedy of her scenes very well; she could have opted for a more regal distance from the slapstick but plays it as rowdy as the rest instead. The scene when she spits in her hand before shaking with matchmaker Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald, who gives the next-best performance after O'Hara) tells you who she is better than any of her many sexy moments on screen. It also gets back to the point of why she's so essential in this film. She is Ireland, the spirit of Erin, and you want her to win, not because she's so pretty but because you know she's good and right for Sean, too.About the only things wrong with the film are the action sequences, the horse race and the fistfight between Sean and Mary Kate's brother. It's not because the scenes aren't terrific, but because they are so abbreviated, especially the fistfight, which feels likes its building to something even funnier and more rousing than what's come before when it just sort of stops. Ford apparently had to do some cutting to get his film in at the required length, and with his focus as much on Mary Kate as possible, probably preferred to trim the scenes that had the least to do with her. But since the focus on O'Hara is what makes the film anyway, this is a small matter. Wayne fans wanting more action will just have to content themselves with almost every other film the Duke ever made.Seeing this film for the first time reminded me a lot of \"Local Hero,\" the 1982 comedy. Not only is \"The Quiet Man\" also a fish-out-of-water story about an American in the British Isles (Scotland in \"Local Hero\"), both films maintain a very delicate balancing act between whimsy and pathos, with \"The Quiet Man,\" siding on the former direction and \"Local Hero\" the latter. Definitely worth checking out the one if you saw and liked the other. But \"Quiet Man\" was there first.",

Maureen would play Wayne's love interest in four more features (\"Rio Grande,\" \"The Wings of Eagle,\" \"McLintock,\" and \"Big Jake\").

Of course, Ford's vision is, by today's standards, a bit outdated. The Ireland of the time in the movie probably doesn't exist any more, but only in the minds of those who knew the Emerald Isle back then.The story is a bit passe, but we make excuses for seeing it once more whenever it plays on cable, as we take the journey to an ideal place that thanks to John Ford will live forever.The best thing in the film is Maureen O'Hara. This actress beauty was legendary. Having met her on a few occasions, I can only say, that she is as beautiful in person as she is in films. Miss O'Hara graced this movie by only being there. The camera loved her; she's perfect as Mary Kate Daneher, the spinster, as the locals call her.The other big assets of the film are the Irish actors that Ford entrusted key roles. Barry Fitzgerald, the impish Michaeleen Flynn, was delightful. Victor McLaglen, is excellent as Squire Will Danaher. John Wayne, as Sean Thornton, is a bit stiff, but maybe Ford's direction called for this actor to play himself in rural Ireland, who knows?This is a film to be treasured.",

            "content": "\"They don't make movies like this anymore\" is the usual phrase heard about classic movies. More appropriately \"They CAN'T make a movie like this anymore\" applies to \"The Quiet Man\".John Ford directed John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara in a number of classic unforgettable Westerns with a familiar supporting cast including Ward Bond, Victor McLaughlin, Mildred Natwick and other pros. \"The Quiet Man\" moves these familiar icons from the post Civil War American West to the post World War II rural Ireland.You don't have to be Irish to appreciate the visual beauty of the Irish countryside and villages or the beauty of Maureen O'Hara, but your appreciation of the story is enhanced if you know something about the unique Irish culture.Ireland and America have been tightly bonded from the earliest Colonial Days of America and are permanently intertwined since the Potato Famine of the 1840's sent tens of millions of immigrants to populate the vast U.S.John Ford perfectly casts John Wayne as the Irish born, U.S. raised troubled ex-boxer returning to his birthplace and Maureen O'Hara as the Irish beauty . The rest of the lovingly assembled cast contains mostly familiar faces in supporting roles.The script covers vast ground in a mostly light-hearted manner. The story plays like most John Ford/John Wayne/Maureen O'Hara movies as one step larger than life.It's clear that everyone appearing in this movie LOVES being in the movie. Maureen O'Hara never looked more beautiful and thrives as the woman in the middle between two warring men, her brother (Victor McLauglin) and her suitor (John Wayne).The over-the-top village to village brawl between John Wayne and Victor McLaughlin is hilarious and ultimately warm hearted. It sums up the strange Irish notion that you have to physically pummel a man before you can have his friendship and respect.There are big scenes and little scenes, but every scene is a delight.This is a movie that can't and won't ever be made again. It's a movie that everyone should enjoy.",

            "content": "It's not only the fact that I'm actually from County Mayo in Ireland where most of the outdoor scenes from The Quiet Man were filmed in the summer of 1951, that makes it my favorite movie of all time. This film has damn near everything for everyone in it without being offensive to anyone (Though the occasional hypersensitive Irish person or Feminist or \"Yank\" might take unfounded offense at the various pokes of fun that are made at various traditions!)For the romantics this has romance in abundance and probabaly some of the most famously erotic (and much copied - A further indication of how hight in esteem this movie is held) scenes ever put on celluoid (without ever more that an absolute minimum of bare flesh being exposed to satify the puritans). Steven Spielburg most famously gives the cottage kissing scene the nod in \"ET\" and it was said of the \"Wet shirt\" Graveyard kissing scene in the rain that, during the many takes it took to get it in the can, Director John Ford only got John Wayne to do everything he wanted to do to Maureen O'Hara himself.For the action brigade it has probabaly the longest and one of the most enthralling fight scenes of any movie.For the comics the entire film is laced with Irishisms and good humor and wild banter and loads of \"craic\"For the weepies it has tragedy and death and a haunting from the past.\nAnd for the pure sentimental including myself the film has my beautiful country lavishly and lovingly displayed in glorious technicholor compliments of Winston C Hoch amnd Archie Stout which deservedly won it an Oscar for cinematography.And it has all this and more...If one cares to delve deeper it touches on themes of Shakespeare (Taming of the Shrew) and the best traditions of Irish literature (JM Synge and WB Yeats).Testament to it's greatness are the many books and documentries that have been created about it in it's wake (Try Des McHales \"The Complete Guide to the Quiet Man\" or Gerry McEntees' \"In the footsteps of the Quiet Man\" for starters!) along with the many tourist that still visit Cong, County Mayo in search of their own dream Inishfree.I've lost count how many times I've seen this movie both in Ireland and in Exile both here in the US and in England, but suffice to say that at this stage I can now quote liberally from such classic lines as Feeney's: \"Silence if you please, Parlimentary procedure, Squire Danagher has the floor\" or Micheleen Og Flynn's \"Homeric, impetious\" upon viewing the marriage bed of Sean and Mary Kate and coming to his own conclusions on the events that may have occured in it.After owning a variety of VHS (both Pal and US versions) of the movie I've finally purchaced the DVD also which allows one (If one so wishes) to watch every frame of the movie digitally remastered - If you are a fanatic like me or Quiet Maniacs as we are sometimes known this allows you to catch a glimpse of such things as a fly landing on Maureen O'Hara cheek during one shot or (In a daring unintentionally risque scene for the 1950's) her momentarially exposing her underwear whilst jumping over a trunk.If you haven't seen this movie (and I'm increasing surprised how many of the younger Blockbuster New Release weaned movie viewers haven't) get yerself down to yer local video store now and look in the Classic Shelves for one of those classics that is sure to be there alongside Ben Hur, Gone with the Wind and Casablanca and rent it out for a great nights entertainment. Better still go and buy a copy 'cos once you've viewed it once like me you'll most likely be hooked and will want to watch it again and again (Even sometimes late at night, round Christmastime, sipping a hot Irish whiskey!)",

This, combined with lovely acting, nice directing from John Ford, a great script and fine location shooting make this a film you must see. On top of that, the film crosses several genres--with some fine romance, a bit of comedy and a lot of escapism.The film begins with an American (John Wayne) wandering into a small Irish town. It seems that his family was originally from there and he wants to settle there. However, from the very start, an obnoxious brute (Victor McLaglen) stands in his way to buy some property and then things heat up when Wayne begins dating McLaglen's sister (Maureen O'Hara). However, this version of John Wayne doesn't just slug McLaglen--he hates violence and is hiding a secret. What's next? See the film.Perhaps the best thing about the film is the wonderful cast of supporting characters--one of the best in Hollywood history. You have Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields (Fiztgerald's real-life brother), Midred Natwick, Ward Bond and many others to provide color and a touch of the Old Country.

It even pokes fun at wife-beating and the IRA with complete good taste.

Michaleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) comes with his horse- drawn chaise and takes Sean to Inisfree. Along their way, Sean sees the red-haired Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) in the field and a cottage in White O'Morn that belongs to the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick). Sean tells to Michaleen that he was born in that cottage and he wants to buy the real-estate. The coachman recognizes him and then they meet Father Peter Lonergan (Ward Bond) that had known Sean's family and welcomes him.When Sean meets Ms. Tillane, her neighbor Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) that wants to buy the property and marry Tillane is very upset with her. When she sells the real-estate to Sean, Will becomes his declared enemy. Sean decides to get married with Mary Kate and he hires the service of the matchmaker Michaleen; however, he does not succeed since Mary Kate is the sister of Will Danaher. However, Michaleen, Father Peter Lonergan, and other locals lure Will and he consents the marriage of his sister expecting to marry the widow Tillane. When he finds that he was deceived, he does not pay the dowry for his sister. Mary Kate tries to force Sean to take her money by force from her brother, but Sean does not want to fight against Will Danaher. Mary Kate and the locals believe that he is a coward, but Sean actually wants to forget a fatal incident from his past and start a new life.\"A Quiet Man\" is a delightful romantic comedy by John Ford. The Irish Maureen O'Hara is sensational in the role of a stubborn woman that wants her dowry no matter how. John Wayne is hilarious in the role of a man that wants to forget his past and start a new life. The situations are very funny in the small Irish village and I loved when a woman gives a stick to Sean to beat the lovely lady. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Depois do Vendaval\" (\"After the Windstorm\")",

            "content": "The Quiet Man is a wonderfully layered and at times hilariously ironic portrayal of Ireland as seen by an American.For those who doubt the film's sense of irony, just re-watch the scene where Sean (John Wayne) paints the door of his cottage. The Vicar's wife remarks on its beauty and in a deadpan manner suggests \"only an American would have thought of Emerald Green\". Only an American (or a foreigner), is the implication, would think that the picturebook Ireland they are seeing in this film is a realistic portrayal of a lived experience of the country. An Irish person would have painted the door red, she says. It weathers better that way.The film takes ideas of Irishness and exaggerates them to brilliant and comic effect. The drinking Mickaleen, the patriarchal rule, the idyllic countryside. But beneath the Oirish exterior is a sharp intelligence and a subversion of what the film at first glance seems to suggest.Beneath the idyllic countryside are elemental forces that are waiting to be disturbed, as we see in the two scenes where Sean and Mary-kate kiss. Storm clouds fill the sky and the wind whips about them. The countryside which previously seemed so welcoming is now tempestuous and threatening. Theirs are passions which do not fit in the comic book world which we have previously seen. Yet they exist.The portrayal of women, and particularly Sean's treatment of Mary-Kate when he drags her through the field is not so oppressive as it might seem. Remember that it is her who insists on receiving her dowry, who equates her possessions to her worth. It is she who forces Sean to act the way he does and fight Will Danaher. She indoctrinates him into her society by threatening to leave him. She withholds the marital bed. Sean eventually becomes the man she wants him to be.In short this is a portrayal of Irish, or more importantly, rural life that is very much from the point of view of the outsider. Of the city folk. Yet it always acknowledges that and has great fun playing with its stereotypes. Its funny, its romantic, it appeals to the part of us that yearns to live a simple life away from the complex world, much as we know that life does not exist. Enjoy it!",

Wayne himself is splendid in his role, I don't think it is his best role but it is up there. In terms of acting, it isn't just Wayne who's good. Maureen O'Hara is both fiery and radiant while Barry Fitzgerald is just fantastic as the mischievous matchmaker who can't say no to a drink. The film also looks beautiful, not just the breathtaking scenery but the cosy cinematography does justice too. There's also a lovely lilting score from Victor Young, a good story, a well-above-average script and even better John Ford's wonderful direction. Overall, just wonderful, maybe not for all but it has certainly made a fan out of me. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "The QUIET MAN is like a good marriage and a fine wine. It has aged well and with each passing year the true movie buff appreciates the beauty of this once-in-a-lifetime-film. John Ford created this film as a tribute to his Irish heritage and surrounded himself with the familiar \"Ford Players\" (Wayne,Maureen O'Hara,Ward Bond,Victor McLaglen,Arthur Shields, Mildred Natwick) plus a galaxy of Irish players to liven up the action.Ford has Wayne cast as the brash(and somehow wealthy) Sean Thorton who is a bit confused with the Irish custom of courting. Sean has returned to the place of his birth because of a promise made to his mother years before and to hide a terrible secret which we learn of half-way through the movie. Sean spies the beautiful Kate and decides that she will be his bride. He also decides to purchase the humble cottage of his childhood from the widow who now owns it.  He does win a bidding war with Will(McLaglen) who not only covets the land but  the widow(Natwick). But Will exacts his revenge by refusing to allow Sean to court Will's sister, the beautiful Kate. Through a bit of Irish chicanery involving a horse race, a bonnet, a pact between the marraige broker(Barry Fitzgerald) and the parish priest(Bond), Sean is indeed able to court Kate and they eventually marry and all seems at peace until Will learns that the widow is not willing to marry him as he was led to believe through innuendo. Will brings the wedding reception to a halt by throwing Kate's dowry to the floor and knocking  out Sean with one mighty blow. It's at this point we learn of Sean's reluctance to fight anyone because as a professional fighter he had killed a man in the ring;  a secret only he and the local Protestant minister(Shields) share. The failure of Sean to fight for Kate's dowry makes her believe that she is married to a coward. On their wedding night she locks the door to their bedroom which Sean kicks open a roughly tosses Kate onto their conjugal bed. But Sean storms from the bedroom and sleeps the night in his sleeping bag. Moving ahead, Sean and Kate finally behave as man and wife one night but the next morning she leaves him because of her \"shame\". Retrieving Kate from a train waiting at the station he literally drags her \"the whole way\" back to Will's farm. There he confronts Will and demands the payment of Kate's dowry in full. When the tight-fisted Will refuses Sean throws Kate at Will's feet and announces, \"The  whole deal's off. It's your custom,not mine\". Will grudgingly throws the money on the ground. Kate realizes Sean has stood up to Will and she opens the firebox of a steam engine and Sean deposits the money in the fire. All of this action is observed by most of the village's population who have been spoiling for a fight between the quiet American and the local bully. And what a fight ensues.  From the farm into the village to the local pub with the villagers watching every blow. Bets are handled by the marraige broker with the odds about even. Even the parish priest and his young assistant are distant observers knowing full well they should be making an attempt to stop the fight. At the pub, Sean and Will decide to take a break from the fisticuffs and share a drink or two. Here the fight ends abruptly. The fact of who won the fight is not important but Ford makes it clear that these two mountains of men have fought and gained respect for the other. Will and Sean return to Sean's cottage with plenty of Irish cheer in their bellies and are greeted by the \"woman of the house\" who is relieved that her husband and brother have resolved their differences. The cast is introduced at the closing of the movie as Will and the widow ride off in a courting cart driven by the marraige broker with the entire village cheering them on. THE QUIET MAN is a movie that mere words fail to do justice. The music(Victor Young), the Technicolor photography and second unit direction(Archie Stout and Winton Hoch),the perfect supporting cast, the dialogue and the feel of this movie are of perfection with the director and stars reaching heights rare in a Republic Studio production. Its been nearly 47 years since I viewed this movie for the first time and it remains(as with many movie buffs) my favorite film experience.",

A labor of love for director John Ford, who won an Oscar for his work while getting award-worthy performances from leads Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, both of whom are clearly impassioned by this boisterous romantic comedy. Thick with Irish humor, which some may tag as cornball, the movie is nevertheless touched by sweet romance, and features one of the sexiest kisses-in-the-rain ever! O'Hara's mercurial bride--at once angry, lusty, insistent and chaste--is one of the lovely actress's most unforgettable characters, but don't count out the Duke. Handsome and lean, with rousing temperament on demand, Wayne is at his most likable here, providing one of his top three classic performances. The cinematography by Winton C. Hoch and Archie Stout (also Oscar winners) alternates between location shooting and studio-sets for a sometimes jarring appearance, and the film's pacing and narrative occasionally hit a prickly burr, but otherwise this is a wonderfully hearty, old-fashioned entertainment. ***1/2 from ****",

It depicted a fantasy world that surely couldn't have existed in Ireland even in the 1920's but it doesn't matter, you still wish that it could exist today. Such rustic charm and simple indulgences are in short supply nowadays at least in the West, and Hollywood long ago forgot the meaning of the word charm.Ex-boxer Wayne from Pittsburgh with a dark secret decides to return to olde Innisfree where he was born, makes friends and enemies and falls in love with barefoot shepherdess O'Hara. There's some glorious atmospheric photography on display throughout, such as of splinters of sunlight though tree branches or the undulating countryside under threatening skies. The outdoor scenes shot in the studio only detract from the overall beauty a little. Favourite bits (among so many): Wayne moving into his cottage in the storm to find O'Hara's swept it up neatly for him; the Homeric clutter in the bedroom after the wedding night; Wayne stretching his legs from Castlemaine with an enraged 5 mile grind home, and of course the Fight with McLaglen (giving Wayne 21 years too). The rousing end review and climax to bagpipe and orchestra must be viewed to the very end with the Republic Pictures logo fading \u0096 to me this symbolises the end of an era, the energetic full stop to the Golden Age of Hollywood.A simple inconsequential tale, memorable in all departments, a classic that will still be shifting DVD's or whatever they have in the future (probably with all cigarettes, pipes and their smoke airbrushed) when the present \"charming\" movies are all forgotten.",

Nevertheless, it has a timeless quality that transcends mere 'imagery' and an emotional pull that is overwhelming, (and not just for teary-eyed Irishmen like myself; just look at Spielberg's great homage to it in \"ET\").Essentially a re-working of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" in an Irish setting, it represented probably the best screen work of almost everyone involved, Ford included, (he won his fourth Oscar for it). Certainly Wayne was never more likable in a role while Maureen O Hara was positively transcendent. And again to devotees, the dialogue remains endlessly quotable; (it has one of the great scripts, a vast improvement on Maurice Walsh's source material). The performers are so comfortable in their roles there is a wonderful improvisatory feel to their lines, (Barry Fitzgerald's '... Homeric' or Jack MacGowran's 'Your in-laws are coming to visit you, Squire darlin' and has MacGowran ever come close to emulating his work here?).One for the desert island and repeated viewings and no mistake.",

But I will say that I believe that this isn't the misogynist dream that some feminists believe this film to be. The worst thing that Sean Thornton does to Mary Kate is drag her back to her brother to demand the dowry. Remember, this comes AFTER she strands him in town and he is forced to walk home. But Thornton is a gentleman that refuses to beat a woman. When he comes back home from his long walk, Mary Kate offers him a stick, expecting Sean to beat her as punishment for leaving him in town. Instead he throws it in the fire. Later, when he is dragging Mary Kate along on the famous \"good stretch of the legs\" march, Sean meets a villager who gives him a stick to \"beat the wife\" with. Even though he is hopping mad, Sean throws away the stick. People who watch the entire movie know that Sean loves Mary Kate because of, not in spite of, her fiery spirit, and wants to be her partner, not her master. \"The Quiet Man\" is a wonderful romance that deserves to be seen more often than on St. Patrick's Day.",

Whoa just a moment there folks.First of all this film was directed by John Ford, who was born in Ireland. Maureen O'Hara and her two brothers, who play secondary roles in The Quiet Man, were ALSO born in Ireland.  So were Barry Fitzgerald and his brother, Arthur Shields, who plays the Episcopal priest against the Catholic priest of Ward Bond who is also Irish.  Who would have the nerve to say that Victor McLaughlen's accent wasn't authentic?  He was born in Ireland and won a Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of Gipo Nolan in The Informer-a film about the early days of \"The Troubles\" that just happened to be directed by John Ford.The extras were chosen from The famed Abbey Players of Dublin and locals from the village of Cohn (sp), where the film was shot.  The old man with the beard is the brother of the director, John Ford, himself a STAR in the silent days of film in Ireland.That leaves poor Mildred Natwick with her accent at sixes and sevens.  She was impeccable as The Widow Trahern, the woman Big Red Danaher hopes to marry some day, when he gets up the nerve to ask her properly.To modern eyes, The Quiet Man IS sexist and brutal.  No modern woman, outside Ireland, would stand for such treatment.  The sad truth is though that a women in Ireland are STILL considered to be the property of the man she marries and of the Catholic Church.  Both expect her to produce many children and have her husband's supper on the table when he gets home. If you don't believe me, just watch Daniel Day Lewis films-My Left Foot or In The Name of the Father.People who are offended by the social order outlined in The Quiet Man will ALSO be offended by MOST of the films of the 30's, 40's and 50's from every corner of the world.For the rest of us, The Quiet Man is a feast for the eyes and a tonic for the soul.  It is FUN to watch John Wayne stride across a field dragging his recalcitrant wife along.The windy kiss is gorgeous and the kiss Wayne gives O'Hara AFTER he kicks down the door in great Rhett Butler form, is amazing.  When John Wayne kissed a woman, she stayed kissed for hours.  When he picks up O'Hara and tosses her on the bed, AFTER THAT kiss, HER reaction is marvelous!  No woman should miss The Quiet Man for those scenes.And, when was the last time you saw anything about Ireland where the Catholic Priest and the Episcopal or Anglican Priests were FRIENDS who could attend parties together and where no one was shooting at each other because of the church they attended?  For that alone, The Quiet Man is a marvelous film.  I love it more every time I watch it.",

He had Irish roots and tendered them faithfully in a number of flms, but this could be considered his ultimate live affair with Ireland. It's all about Irish traditions and sticking to the roots, and Victor Young's music follows this pattern conscientiously in adorning the film throughout with old Irish folk music and melodies, crowning it all with a tremendous battle fugue, as the knuckles get the better of the plot. But the dominating trait of the film is a pastoral idyll with sincere affection for the Irish way. The pub scenes have been called \"the most typically Irirish pub scenes of all\", and obviously John Ford put special effort in embracing the human side of Irish life. John Wayne is kept down to a restricted \"quiet\" character making this one of his best appearances, and Maureen O'Hara is always perfect and especially perfect here. Some say that the most important character is actually Barry FitzGerald, and he certainly makes one of his most considerable and memorable contributions. Victor MacLaglen was an old favourite of John Ford's from the award-winning \"The Informer\" some 15 years earlier and couldn't be better for the character he is playing. In brief, everything is perfect in this pastoral comedy of Ireland with dramatic ingredients with, of course, a tremendous man-to-man fight in the end to crown it all, finishing up, of course, at the local pub.",

Directed by John Ford, they were unconquerable.Second, the cinematography. The landscapes are lush and rolling. The interior shots are filled with little details that add so much to the scene. You can almost imagine what the Cohen's pub must smell like (\"Over here, we pronounce it, CO-han!\"). And in almost every shot, there is the color green.Third, the writing and the lines. My family quotes the film like gospel. I was helping to move a bed into a house, and as I entered through the front door, I somberly spoke \"God bless all here.\" We all got the joke.Fourth, the music. So perfectly chosen and composed. It adds to each and every scene.Fifth, the fight scene. A classic Irish donnybrook! So many things about this film I cherish. Also, it's one of the few films that John Wayne doesn't shoot a gun! A marvelous, marvelous film! In their book \"The Big Damn Book of Sheer Manliness\", the Von Hoffman brothers called this film one of the \"top 25 greatest guy movies of all time\".

You may also need at least a little Irish in you to have an appreciation for it, if not an emotional attachment, with all of its \"characters\" that are sometimes blatant stereotypes (albeit joyful ones that are akin to the Taming of the Shrew premise and, as such, Shakespearean in vulgarity and lust-for-life). I know my 1/4 just got by barely in this lot.Ford starts simple and keeps it simple till the end, but there are strands and plot points that enrich the material: John Wayne is an ex-boxer who, unbeknownst to all except one priest, is back in Inishfree, his hometown and home to seven generations of Thorntons, to set up a little cottage and live peacefully, only to fall head over heels (in that Quiet way of course) for Maureen O'Hara's Mary-Kate and marry her, against the wishes of stubborn lummox/brother Red Danaher (Victor McLaglen, about as big and beefy and amazing as one could have in one 1/2-dimensional part). The bulk of the picture is about the fractured relationship between Mary Kate and Thornton, and how she can't completely be with him unless she can get the dowry from her brother which he's withholding... and Thornton can't bare to do if it means another murderous fight like in the states.The film has incredible color cinematography (albeit it's hard to always tell from the lack of a really well-transfered DVD print), the mood is often about as lively as the booze or just fiery and quirky personalities will allow, and the stars look handsome and beautiful in good measure. Sometimes Wayne can come off a little stiff or just plain overrated in certain performances, but this among other Ford performances act as a showcase for his unlikely appeal as a male lead (if only to me, not to many). O'Hara here also gives such a good performance, so spot-on moving between the Shrewish joy and self-righteous anger of Mary-Kate, it almost makes one forget how incorrigible her character can get; her beauty may also be a factor in this too, but it's mostly her timing, both comic and dramatic, that do it right. Ditto for Barry Fitzgerald who is a perfect old codger driving the cart and acting as an unofficial observer, along with Father Lonergan.Somehow the Quiet Man should be way too silly and crazy and something only out of Irish folk tales to fully work, like that final climactic bout where literally everyone in a ten-mile radius comes to see the fight between Thornton and brother Danaher go all over town and into the bar (as the coda to the fight, too, when the two men genially arrive back at the cottage drunk as hell and singing songs). But Ford surprised me with the film's classy and occasionally breathtaking film-making, the fun in the unlikely and obvious romance and and 'courtship', and its star power. I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece akin to Searchers or Grapes of Wrath, but it's probably a breezier time to have than those on a nice weekend afternoon.",

Often beautifully photographed, it plays on Irish (and Irish-American) stereotypes knowingly and deliberately to achieve its effect -- which is to make us laugh. So lighten up, people.",

But even as good as his performance is, Maureen O'Hara's is even better. Both leads are frequently upstaged by the character actors John Ford populated this film with from start to finish. Arthur Shields as Reverend Playfair, Mildred Natwick as the widow Tillane, Ward Bond as Father Lonergan Sean McClory as Owen Glynn, Jack MacGowran as Feeney and many others give wonderful performances here. Barry Fitzgerald chews the scenery as the matchmaker and sometimes treasonist Michaleen Flynn and Victor MacLaglen got an Academy Award nomination for an overdone performance as Will Danaher, O'Hara's brother.Wayne plays a retired prizefighter sworn off fighting who's returned to his birthplace for peace and a well-earned obscurity because of what happened in his last fight. He successfully buys his birthplace and its surrounding farm from the widow, making an enemy of Danaher in the process. He slowly wins over the people of the village, starting with Flynn, the two clerics and the local IRA man Glynn.Then he sees O'Hara and is struck by her, deciding he wants to marry her. Thus begins the central plot of the film-the clash of Irish ways with Sean Thornton's more relaxed and open approach, comparatively speaking. Mary Kate's \"fortune\" (dowry) becomes a sticking point when Thornton couldn't care less whether she gets it or not.By a subterfuge, Danaher is convinced to give consent and the couple are married, buy Mary Kate considers Sean a coward because he won't fight for her dowry. The film climaxes with a chase at the railway and a monumental fight between Thornton and Danaher.This film is on DVD and Blu Ray and is well worth getting. Recommended.",

During Shaun's last fight a horrible incident occurs to which he hangs up his boxing gloves for the last time.The enjoyment starts from the very beginning when Shaun Thornton arrives at the little train depot, asking for directions on how to get to Inisfree. The fun really starts when he falls for the beautiful Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), Shaun has to battle in more ways than one against Mary Kate's bully of a brother Red Will Danaher (played by Victor McLaglen). Featuring one of the classic fight scenes in cinema history and honored with two Academy Awards. John Ford's 'The Quiet Man' is one of Hollywood's most enduring and romantic epics.The entire cast brings this film together\u0085.it was sort of a family affair really, seeing two of John Wayne's children in a scene. Then you have Maureen O'Hara's real life brother playing the part of Hugh Forbes (as Charles FitzSimons). Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields are also real life brothers.

            "review_title": "Sodom and Begorrah",
            "content": "\"The Quiet Man\", set in 1930s Ireland, was an unusual departure for John Ford, best known as a director of Westerns, Ford, however, was himself of Irish descent and had long cherished the ambition to make a film based on the original short story by Maurice Walsh, first published in 1933. Eventually, Republic Pictures agreed to finance the film provided that Ford agreed to make a Western for them with the same stars, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. (The result was \"Rio Grande\"). Wayne was, of course, a frequent collaborator with Ford, and the film also features two other such collaborators, Victor McLaglen and Ward Bond.Sean Thornton an Irish-American from Pittsburgh, returns to his native village of Innisfree (a fictional village named after the real island featured in Yeats' poem) and purchases the farmhouse in which he was born. Thornton also falls in love with a local girl, Mary Kate Danaher, but unfortunately she is the sister of the local squire, who dislikes Thornton because he wanted to buy the farmhouse himself but was outbid. Thornton and Mary Kate eventually marry, but a further dispute arises when Mary Kate's brother, Will, refuses to give his sister the dowry to which she is entitled by custom and makes it clear that, if she wants it, Thornton will have to fight him for it.This leads to a clash between husband and wife. Thornton is not short of money and cares nothing about the dowry, which he does not need, and refuses to fight Danaher. Mary Kate does not need the money either, but for her it is a matter of principle and she brands him a coward for failing to confront her brother. He in turn brands her obsession with obtaining the dowry as greedy and materialistic. Unknown to her he has another reason for not wanting to fight. In America he was a boxer, but quit the sport after accidentally killing an opponent in the ring, vowing never to fight again.This scenario could have been the basis for a serious film, even a tragedy. Thornton does, after all, face a potentially tragic dilemma, the choice between the love of his wife and loyalty to his pacific principles (which have earned him the nickname of the \"quiet man\"). The film is, however, broadly a comedy, although it occasionally veers towards greater seriousness. Ford and McLaglen, for example, are never quite sure how Will Danaher should be played; at times he seems like a comic braggart, all bluff and bluster, while at others he comes across as a nasty bully and genuine villain.The best acting performance is probably from Maureen O'Hara; at least her Irish accent, unlike some of the others, is genuine. Wayne seems a bit outside his comfort zone, and Victor McLaglen seems miscast as Will Danaher, being more than thirty years older than his supposed sister O'Hara. It also seems unlikely that someone in his mid-sixties could have held his own in a fist-fight with a man twenty years younger who once fought as a professional heavyweight boxer. (Will is referred to as \"Red Will\", even though McLaglen did not have red hair. Given Will's capitalist greed this is unlikely to be a reference to his politics).The film is ostensibly set in the post-independence Irish Free State, but the real location of the action is Hollywood's own version of Ye Olde Merrie Ireland, a timeless never-never land of thatched cottages, of pints of Guinness, of fiery red-haired colleens, of happy peasants who speak in accents so thick that you expect every other word to be \"begorrah!\" or \"bejasus!\". It is a place quite untouched by the religious conflicts which bedevil the real Ireland; both the local Catholic priest and (perhaps more surprisingly) the local Protestant vicar play important roles in the story. The only allusion to the civil war which had only recently torn the country apart is a single gratuitous reference to the IRA. It is a place of happy endings, where two grown men can beat seven bells out of each other for about ten minutes without either of them suffering a bruise or a scratch and then sit down happily together to sip their Guinness, best friends forever.This sort of idealised ethnic stereotyping is not necessarily a bad thing in a film, at least not in a comedy. Moreover, it is not necessarily confined to Hollywood. The picture of England painted in Ealing comedies like \"The Titfield Thunderbolt\", also from the early fifties, can be equally idealised. Yet \"The Quiet Man\" is not a film I really care for. Too often its genial Oirishry serves as a cloak for some unpleasant behaviour. The scene where Thornton physically forces Mary Kate to walk back to the village with him from the station indicates that he is at best a bully and at worst guilty of domestic violence. I thought that he gave up his pacifist principles far too easily; his reasons for refusing to fight were honourable ones and his wife only wants him to fight over an empty point of principle. (When Thornton finally gets the money he throws it, with Mary Kate's full approval, into the fire). \"A Man's Gotta Do What a Man's Gotta Do\" might be an appropriate moral code for the lawless Old West. In an otherwise peaceful Irish village it just seems like a recipe for pointless brawling. Perhaps Ford's Ireland is not so idealised after all. For an Irish-American he is surprisingly ready to rely upon Anglo-Saxon prejudices about the Irish being hard-drinking, talkative and quarrelsome. 4/10",

            "content": "Like the other Ford pictures i've seen, it looks very nice - but its content is unwittingly cruel and unusual - made even more so by the fact that these scenes are accompanied by happy, triumphant music - which tells us the filmmaker's opinions of the feelings behind these scenes, at least in this era. The first hour and a bit may be enjoyed as a sweet but simple fish-out-of-water romance. But after that the movie's themes become too prominent, which leads to an unusual, uncomfortable feeling in any honest viewer.O'Hara fans be warned: i've fallen out of love with her just as quickly as a fell in love. Here she appears as a luminous beauty for a few scenes, then quickly turns into a hoary nagging fishwife.(SPOILERS)Wayne is escaping a history of violence in the US - he killed a man while boxing - but he isn't being wise when he refuses to fight again, and thinks that his new bride's dowry isn't worth fighting for - he's being cowardly. The progression of his character involves his finally accepting \"the irish culture\", in which two men may beat each other to a pulp and turn out the best of friends.Its conception of irish values is rather superficial and frivolous.The \"resolution\" is ridiculous: O'Hara is completely in her rights in that culture expecting her dowry, and Wayne should have confronted her brother about it - so why does he trample all over her, even when he's doing what she asks, and then throws the damn dowry in the incinerator, thus cancelling the entire dramatic tension of the movie.So while the Quiet Man, like Gone with the Wind, comes across as happy, due to colourful cinematography and swirling, romantic music, these trimmings are used to disguise some objectionable notions of its filmmakers (and, i suppose, the entire era, which saw women as subordinate to men, and men in their rights to throw them around). The moral of the story is that a man will assert himself like a Yankee pig, aggressing physically against anyone who stands in his way, if he's a good man. The underscore composer went nuts with swirling romantic music as soon as Wayne started throwing his wife around: throwing her on the bed, dragging her across the countryside like a dog (the same treatment often afforded to African-Americans in movies of the period by Southern White Men). If this is how they treat women in Ireland, i think WE're in our rights to look down on them.As soon as a villager handed John Wayne a stick and said \"for beating your wife with\" I knew I and this movie were suffering from a major generation gap.",

Soon after Will has even more to be upset with when Sean decides that he wants to date Will's sister Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara).John Ford's THE QUIET MAN is not only a very good romantic comedy but it's also a love letter from the director to Ireland. Ford would make a handful of films in or about Ireland and it's clear that his eye (aka the camera) has a soft spot for the beautiful locations and this bleeds over to the screen just like Monument Valley was a key thing in his Westerns. THE QUIET MAN is certainly a highly entertaining little gem and it's certainly not exactly what you'd expect from the director-star.It was probably wise to not have Wayne attempt an Irish accent and the reason for him not having one is perfectly cared for in the film but there's no question that this is unlike any other performance the actor gave. He's basically asked to play the romantic lead and he certainly nails the performance and it remains one of the best of his career. His comic timing here is quite good and he mixes it up well with the supporting players and especially Barry Fitzgerald whose comedy steals the picture. O'Hara is brutally strong in her performance and the toughness she brought the role was terrific. Then there's McLaglen who really deserves so much more attention that he receives as he's wonderfully entertaining here and a lot of the film's charm comes from his performance.There are many great scenes inside the picture including the famous kiss sequence, which was put to use in Steven Spielberg's E.T.. There's also the terrific fight at the end of the picture, which has to be one of the most entertaining to ever be put on film. Ford's direction is spot on and there's no question that the visuals are quite a treat. There's a lot of entertainment to be had from THE QUIET MAN and a lot of the credit has to go to the terrific cast.",

Barry Fitzgerald adds quite a bit to his scenes, in one of his many fine character parts.The story combines some good lighter moments with a thoughtful look at Wayne's character and at the community in which he has made his new home.

            "content": "I am uncertain how to critique this film objectively. I will start by making a critique of some other critiques. One complaint is the 'stereotypes' of the Irish. These complaints reveal both the Political Correctness of the complainers \u0096 and their ignorance. The Director, John Ford (real name Sean Aloysius O'Fearna) was born and raised in Ireland and was very much the moving force in producing this movie. Why? Because he liked the script. The leading lady, Maureen O'Hara (real name Maureen Fitzsimons) was also born and raised in Ireland. She also helped get the film produced. Why? Because she liked the script.Now, If these two Irish born participants in the picture don't find anything offensive, why should we? The greatest offense seems to be depicting the Irish as people who like to drink and fight. Having known many Irishmen I can say many do, in fact, like to drink and fight. Stereotypes usually originate in a firm foundation of fact.Secondly, they are horribly offended by the 'violence against women', blah, blah, blah. Now, the Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne characters in this movie were repeated pretty much hereafter in every picture they did together. It is, in fact, a very old theme. People who hate the idea of a fiery, strong willed female finally tamed by a confident, dominant male can find equal hatred for Shakespeare, just read 'Taming of the Shrew'. It was an old theme when Shakespeare wrote it.Sadly, they were so busy being offended they missed what a fine athletic performance Maureen O'Hara gave as John Wayne dragged her along. She was a real trooper. That bit of athletic performance was no mean feat.Now, back to the film. It seemed syrupy, smalzy and contrived. So bad, at times, it was cloying and annoying. The plot seemed paper thin and artificial, merely a threadbare artifice to generate false conflict. The characters were all stock characters and hence all wholly predictable as was the inevitable outcome. Thus, with no genuine tension and no real character development that drew you in; it was hard to sustain interest in this film.My difficulty is, as a boy, I use to love all of the John Ford/Maureen O'Hara/John Wayne pictures. Yet, I doubt most of them were any better than this. So why now do I find this so unengaging? I think because as a boy, as did the larger society, we believed these simple smarmy sentiments. I probably believed that when two men fought they would afterwards become friends ( a frequent theme in films of this era). I now know that the victor usually feels contempt for the loser and the loser has a burning hatred of the winner for the humiliation inflicted on him. And so it is with the other sentimental claptrap.However, it may also be the era in which we live. Now we live where every disgusting, evil human perversion is just a click of the mouse away. Where car jacking, once shocking, are now just accepted as normal life. Where terrorists kill by the thousands and drug dealers enslave by the tens of thousands. We live in an era that has grown callous and cynical. Simple, smarmy sentiments like mom, home and apple pie simply don't hold much water anymore.So, is impatience for the sugary sentiment in this picture merely a matter of growing up? Is it like the Bible says, \"When I was a child I thought like a child and acted as a child, but now I am a man and have put aside childish ways\".Or, is it because both I and the society at large have grown hard, callous and cynical? Perhaps a little of both.But remember, the generation that saw the release of this film loved this film. Even Hollywood did, giving it two Academy awards. And they were grown ups, having lived through a Great Depression and a World War. Certainly, they had no illusions..... So perhaps it is just us..... A newer generation without illusions, but also without faith.",

Just this once, let's allow him to indulge himself.When Ford filmed How Green Was My Valley a decade earlier, California stood in for the Welsh hills. For the Quiet Man, nothing less than the real thing would do, and all exteriors were shot on location in Ireland. Ford's aim seems to have been to capture the beauty of the emerald isle on celluloid and bring back it to the audiences at home. But the way he reveals this beauty is tentative and gradual, and bares much similarity to the way he uses the wild plains in his Westerns. In the opening scenes, the green of Ireland is something glimpsed through windows and doorways, just out of reach. As John Wayne and Barry Fitzgerald set off, the space slowly opens out, each shot becoming more exquisite. Ford never allows the landscape to have total dominance, but cleverly makes us miss it by showing the interiors as cramped and gloomy, to build things up before hitting us with another outdoor eyeball-pleaser.Speaking of the green, this is Ford's first really excellent use of colour. It's been stated that every shot has something green in it, which is incorrect, although it may be true that there is something green on every set. In fact Ford is very careful in controlling the colours and sometimes makes use of the complete absence of that particular shade. For example, in the shot where we see Sean looking out towards the cottage where he was born, there is no green, which gives a contrast to the overwhelming greenness of the sight he views which we see in the opposing shot. In the scene at the Danaher residence where the labourers are sitting down to eat, everything is composed in blues and greys, with a single splash of green to be viewed through a window when the camera pans to the far end of the room.Ford was well known for his stock company of actors. For this picture he has milked that company for every Irish type it held. The funny thing is, Ford regulars Barry Fitzgerald, Mildred Natwick and Arthur Shields may be playing their ultimate stereotype roles, but they are all doing a fine job of it, especially Natwick who gives one of her best performances. Victor MacLaglen was in fact English of Scotch descent, but he could do the accent. The character of Squire Danaher suits him well, being a villainous and slightly more intelligent variation on the blustering buffoon he played in Ford's cavalry Westerns. If nothing else it is good to see him out of the pure comic relief parts and into a role of some substance. However there are two very special honourable mentions I must make. The first is for Jack MacGowran in one of his earliest appearances. Now his is truly a comic relief part that has no bearing on the plot. In fact he may not even have been scripted, given all he really does is hover round and come out with little utterances (sometimes just repeating someone else's line) that would seem odd on paper, but are charmingly funny in his delivery. If it weren't for the fact he only has a line or two here and there he would be a regular scene-stealer. The second honourable mention is for Francis Ford, the director's big brother, who appeared as a mute drunk in dozens of Ford pictures. Here, for once, he gets a few lines of dialogue, as well as a very tender portrayal. Given that the old man would be dead a year or so later, the younger Ford's reverential treatment of his sibling is particularly poignant.I must admit, it took me a long time to like the Quiet Man. Its twee oirishness is absolutely done to death, and its apparent misogyny is grating to say the least. However, if you look closely, there are actually some clever twists in the battle of the sexes going on here \u2013 just look at Maureen O'Hara's expression (which the camera catches, but the Duke's character wouldn't see) after their reconciliation at the end. As to the Irish stereotyping, you have to not take it too seriously (as Ford surely did) and to accept it in its touching naivety. You have to allow yourself to briefly enter a world of blarney, porter and men cracking each other in the jaw without leaving a mark. Of course this is not Ireland. This is John Ford.",

            "content": "On the one hand this is a beautiful looking movie, with some great actors and also potentially entertaining and good characters in it but due to its story and the storytelling I feel that this movie isn't really as great and classic as it potentially could had been.To be honest, the storytelling of the movie just seemed silly to me at times. The movie does some surprising and unexpected things and I don't mean that in a positive way. Here we have two persons desperately trying to get married but once they have they never allow themselves to be happy with each other and complain and means like a couple that have been married for 15 years to each other. I had a hard time figuring out the different characters and what they exactly wanted. The one moment they are angry and fighting each and the other they are laughing and drinking together. And no, I'm of course not just talking about the John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara characters.The treatment of women in this story is also hardly complimentary. Sure, it's about the Irish somewhat old fashioned culture but seeing John Wayne dragging around his wife for 5 miles and slapping her on the butt for comedy effect just seems wrong to me.It's still not really hard to see why this is being regarded an 'Irish' classic, despite being an American, Republic Pictures, movie. It's a movie that shows the beauty of Ireland, I mean I've never seen John Wayne so colorful and in such a beautiful environment before and it's also really a movie that is all about Irish culture. They seem to have some strange customs and of course there are some of the stereotyped Irish characters here but overall this really seems like a great advertisement for the country and for that purpose the movie and it's franchise is still being used today. There even is a The Quiet Man tour to take, that makes you visit some of the locations at which this movie was shot.To me the movie didn't really started off as a comedy and it seemed more to be a dramatic/romance movie. However as it progressed the movie become more and more fun and entertaining to watch, which was also really due to the entertaining characters of the movie, that inhabit the small town the movie got set in. They however never really went all the way with this and it seems to me that if this movie wasn't holding back with this it could had really been a very entertaining and classic movie.A good movie that suffers from some incoherent storytelling and the choice to not make this movie entertaining all throughout.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

University in that former British colony doesn't begin until October, but, because starting at that time would not afford me enough credits, I chose to take part in an \"early semester,\" which meant starting school at the same time as my friends in America--early September. I chose the early semester in Irish literature because, obviously, I was a literature major. One component of this six-week, intensive course was a film unit during which we planned on watching among other things, Carol Reed's Odd Man Out. Then the Twin Towers fell and the professor overseeing the film unit thought Odd Man Out might be a bit too distressful for us. I'm not sure why, though, as I've still yet to see that film. In any event, the prof announced a replacement--the Quiet Man. My guess is because most of the films we saw during that section were fairly heavy, dealing with the Troubles and whatnot, they instructors thought it best to tone down the violence a bit. So, here was a lighthearted romp with the powerful John and Beautiful Maureen. Perfect. Sort of. It was perfectly atrocious. I adore John Ford and could find very little to recommend about this movie. It's misogynistic, even by the standards of 1950s American cinema (hey, John, is it really acceptable for a man to drag a woman by her hair in any era? Didn't that sort of fall by the wayside after the closing of the Frontier?), and it's not terribly moving. O'Hara and Wayne have no chemistry whatsoever and the story itself is banal. The Irish countryside should offer Ford a chance to show his cinematographic chops, but he doesn't. The greens are rich (thank you technicolor), but the images are uninspiring on the whole. Having lived in Ireland for nearly half of a year, I can safely say it's a hundred times more beautiful than this movie would have you believe. Then there are the Irish stereotypes. Was it entirely necessary to trot them out again? Yes, John, I know your ancestors come from this land and that this film was a dream of yours for many a year, but you seem so completely out of touch with the surroundings. It's amazing that a man who has such a feel for unique environments could transform Ireland into something to uninteresting. (Maybe it's because, as I've just learned, some of the film was made on soundstages in Hollywood.)Ford could make great non-Westerns--The Grapes of Wrath is among the greatest socially conscious films to this day--but they were his forte. He may have loved the Quiet Man and placed it among his greatest achievements. I doubt many others would do the same.",

There, Mr. Wayne is immediately attracted to comely red-haired beauty Maureen O'Hara (as Mary Kate Danaher). Ms. O'Hara plays hard to get by sparring with Mr. Wayne, but her passionate desire for him is evident in director John Ford's close-ups. The couple must deal with O'Hara's burly brother Victor McLaglen (as Squire \"Red\" Will Danaher), who is against the marriage and got off on the wrong track with Wayne by being outbid on his property. Eventually, Wayne's dark secret surfaces...Acting like an alcoholic leprechaun, Barry Fitzgerald (as Michaleen Oge Flynn) and Mr. Ford's regulars make up a boozy supporting cast. \"The Quiet Man\" is beautifully shot, in Ireland. It was a milestone for the \"Republic\" production studio, and a shimmering success. The film won much critical approval and some big awards - including \"Best Picture\" from the \"National Board of Review\", top director (Ford) at the \"Academy Awards\", and \"Best Supporting Actor\" (Mr. McLaglen) from the \"Film Daily\".\"The Quiet Man\" can best be described as an Irish version of Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\". When viewed in this light, the violent interplay between Wayne and O'Hara can arguably be taken with a big grain of Blarney Stone. There is also a hint of sadomasochist sex play in the looks exchanged by the couple around the time O'Hara tells Wayne, \"I'll be going home now, and have the supper ready for ye.\" What passes for art can sometimes taken as a celebration of violence.

The other night I was intrigued by the TiVo information about a movie I had never even heard of starring Wayne and Directed by Ford. It sounded like quite a departure for both, especially Wayne in 1952.I just couldn't believe what I was viewing after about 15 minutes into the film. The sweeping and beautiful vistas, the development of a haunted and potentially troubled past of this American come home to the small village in Ireland where he was born...I began thinking of Hollywood's other leading actors of that time, and how this role would probably be better served by the likes of Grant, Gable, Stewart, etc., however...as the movie progressed, I began to see the Duke in a completely new light.Throughout much of the movie, the title aptly decribes Sean Thorton, at least his dialog. Few parts for much of the story involve John speaking more than a sentence or two, it seems often times just a few words at a time; and those were in scenes where the bulk of the dialog were from his co-stars and supportng actors. However this isn't really even noted except early on. But once you become absorbed in his screen presence, and as the plot develops, the charisma and presence of the actor are HUGE! Make no mistake, this movie magnificently illustrates how incredible Wayne was as a leading man in a superb drama. It's often times mentioned by the legendary actors who appear on Inside the Actors Studio, that movie magic is captured in many a scene where we just behold the actors in silence. This to me captures that very concept.I won't go into the plot or theme much more than I have. but I will say after one viewing, I have to place this movie in my personal top three of Wayne's body of work. My wife, who wasn't a big Wayne fan to begin with, but loves the romances from this period, simply fell in love with this movie.One a scale of 1-10, 10.",

Ford knows how to frame, but all is in service to that simple dramatic value of Griffith. I am especially unattracted to Irish films dominated by the overbearing romanticism of Irish Americans. This film is as patronizing as 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People' of only a couple years later. One wouldn't have a glimmer from this that the Irish are the best storytellers in the world and their stories are characterized less by the broad childish sweeps shown here, but subtlety, ambiguity and self-reference - in short all the things that the Welles tradition followed in reaction to the traditions of Ford. Not until 'Barry Lyndon' do we in the world of film get Ireland back.But I do appreciate Ms O'Hara. Not as an actress, but as an icon. She owes her fame to Technicolor, which exaggerated her red hair. As she was one of the first big redhead stars in color, she helped established a film archetype. Together with Katherine Hepburn, she defined a notion of independent strength, sex suborned to character, unexpected wisdom, a red mother earth of sorts. This also defined one of the prefabbed pigeonholes we snap to in our own personal relationships. So revisiting these films is a visit into our own history and selves.Until the last 15 minutes, she is one character: proud, independent, sexy. In that last fifteen minutes she asserts her independence and is violently interrupted by her Yankee thug husband, beaten, dragged roughly through sheep dung in front of the entire village (no small insult). He then extorts the money which forms the one plot thread, burns it in contempt, beats her brother (shown as a noble, even admired contest), and then comes home drunk with the brother and rudely demands dinner. She submits, and we ate it up.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

The strong, silent man who refuses to raise his hand in violence is a trope that Hollywood can't get enough of... and I'm no John Wayne fan. But this movie (as opposed to the westerns) convinces me he could act. He's very appealing, embodying a forgiving, easy-going ruggedness. \"Quiet Man\" is neither the usual Ford sentiment, or a lesser Wayne vehicle. Barry Fitzgerald is fondly remembered for his very funny lines here (their delivery is so distinct and vivid) but he has some visual nonsense that's just as comic. I could turn down the volume and he'd still make me laugh. Victor McLaglen is also perfect as the brutish heavy. Every time I see this I find new things to chuckle over. It's very well-directed. One of the tenderest of love scenes in any movie is when John Wayne troops home after a blow-up and abandonment by O'Hara in town. Instead of the blow-up we expect, both characters choose to de-escalate; she wordlessly lights his cigarette and sits in his lap; both of them knowing that words get them into trouble. As they sit staring into the fire, in a chair that doesn't accommodate them too well, he pulls her arm around him. It's one of the loveliest, most enduring images of love I can think of in the movies. There are half a dozen detentes in the movie that are as affecting.

Instead, we are whisked away to the lush, green setting of Innisfree, Ireland and we find beautiful scenery as well as colorful and creative characters. Among them are Maureen O'Hara as the fiery, tempestuous Mary-Kate, Barry Fitzgerald as the matchmaker Flynn, and Ward Bond as the upright Father Lonergann.One of the many elements that make this a timeless and utterly enjoyable film is the fact that Ford includes many more issues than just a romance, which of course is the main focus here but not all. We also get much information on differences between cultures and how it is important to understand that one cannot come from one culture and force his way through another. We also see the sheer innocence of a small Irish town that has little to do but take care of their own land. These people paint their house, grow crops, raise cattle and sheep, go to mass every day, and otherwise take it easy. This is the good life.Among these great actors, Wayne gives the best performance perhaps because it is so anti-John Wayne. He isn't so macho and intimidating as he usually is. He has a dark side and secrets and hopes to forget it all when he leaves America. O'Hara is wonderful here, standing toe-to-toe with Wayne in every scene. Yet we feel genuine love between them. I also have to mention Victor McLaglen, one of Ford's Stock Company actors who won an Oscar in 1936 with Ford in The Informer and here is the stubborn but ultimately likable brother of O'Hara who tries to keep them apart then ends up in a fight. By the way, that fight lasts about 7 or 8 minutes and it is funny and joyful all the way. This could be considered a perfect film. Bad things happen but you just know these people will get through them. After all, they have all the time in the world.",

There's a sensitive, complicated romance-with independent-minded Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara), sister of local bully Red Danaher (Victor McLaglen, one of Ford's best company players)-but the real attraction here is Ford's masterful maneuvering of tones and his fluid handling of a large cast of colorful characters, qualities which also defined his iconic (and then-underrated) Westerns. Shot partly on location in Ireland and designed in the lushest greens ever squeezed out of Technicolor, The Quiet Man is a movie that isn't about a whole lot, but yet seems to contain so much-from Wayne's easygoing charisma to the notoriously protracted climactic fight to the febrile, film-noir-like flashback to Sean's boxing days. The Quiet Man is one of Wayne best films and his made possible by beautiful spitfire Maureen O'Hara .",

            "content": "I've never understood people who profess to enjoy fighting.The few fights I've been in have been nasty and brutish and very painful,and,thankfully,very short.It may have been OK for Bob Cherry and Harry Wharton & Co to have a \"rag\" then all end up at the Tuckshop enjoying a sticky bun but they were never kicked in the balls or head - butted as far as I can recall.Not that Messrs Wayne and McClaglen do any such low thing of course.They have a \"fair fight\" for 15 minutes whereas in reality after about 90 seconds they would both have been too exhausted to carry on.\"The Quiet Man\" is,of course,just a Western set in Ireland - or at least John Ford's rose - coloured vision of Ireland. In Mr Ford's Utopian neverland the inhabitants indulge in fisticuffs at the drop of a hat,blacksmiths drop their tools and rush from their anvils,priests drop their fishing rods,shopkeepers wipe their hands on their aprons and rush out into the street to watch a \"Donnybrook\" - usually preceded by the adjective \"grand\".Just like in Dodge City then. The IRA,resting between campaigns,gave its members time to wander into pubs with their collars turned up proclaiming \"God Bless all here\" rather like the Pope.Well,it's a harmless enough fantasy I suppose. The movie is arguably beyond criticism because it is impossible to take seriously,although I have a horrible suspicion that Mr Ford meant it.A stranger comes into town,falls in love with the beautiful sister of the big rancher - sorry,landowner who thinks the stranger a coward because he won't fight etc etc,the scriptwriters were hardly stretching themselves were they?That fiery colleen Maureen O'Hara flashes her eyes a lot when Himself exercises what Mr Ford presumably considered to be every Irishman's right to beat the crap out of his wife.You begin to wonder exactly what sort of fantasy he had in mind. I know that Mr Ford,like his contemporary Mr Hitchcock was a bit of a weird bloke,the humiliation of Jefffrey Hunter's Indian \"bride\" in the otherwise masterful \"The Searchers\" is painful to watch,but his treatment of Ms O' Hara is deeply offensive. So,to sum up,if you like movies set in some \"Brigadoon\"- like country where they treat their chickens better than they treat their women, where the slightest dispute is settled by violence and where the people are in total subservience to the church and the land owners, \"The Quiet Man\" is right up your street.If,however,you live on the Planet Earth in the 21st century you may more profitably spend your time watching paint dry.",

This was one of my grandfather's favorite films, and since his tastes usually match mine when it comes to old films, I gave this one a try. Oh, boy...Well, if you like films that portray Irish people in the most stereotypical way possible, this is certainly the film for you! Even though this film is old, I cannot believe the way violence against women is glorified in this film. Call me a feminist, liberal, or whatever, but this film is by far one of the most sexist that I have ever seen. John Ford had a reputation of being nasty to many of his actors, and from what I've read, he was especially nasty to Maureen O'Hara almost every time they worked together. It almost sounds like he got some kind of perverse pleasure in watching her being mistreated on film, as she is in this one. Somehow, though, O'Hara has always praised him, in spite of how he treated her, which baffles me. Then again, having read her autobiography, O'Hara does not sound like she ever had a very healthy relationship with any man, aside from maybe Wayne and Charles Laughton. The only good part of this film is the scenery. Otherwise, it is boring, outdated, sexist, and I don't understand why this was such a favorite of my grandfather's.",

            "content": "Perhaps once in a decade or so, a film is made that is so outstandingly good, so perfect in every way, that it defies categorisation and facile explanation, while continuing to occupy a very special place in the hearts of many people.One such a film is \"The Quiet Man\" - a mixture of gentle humour, romance, mystery - even violence - but without being offensive. While many films share some or all of these qualities, it is the way in which these themes are so skillfully woven together in the lives and personalities of a handful of people that helps to explain something of the charm of The Quiet Man.With the glorious scenery around Cong in the Irish Republic around the 1900s as the backdrop, we are introduced one by one to a variety of delightful characters and to a lifestyle that sadly is no more: pugilistic railwaymen who are ready to put up their fists at the slightest pretext; the fiery Mary Kate who \"packs up wallop\" and has \"a tongue like an adder\" and her equally fierce brother, Red Will Daneher; the cheery pipe-smoking old rogue, Michaeleen O'Flynn with his horse and cart; Father Lonnergan, who is not averse to making the occasional bet on the side; the proud Widow Tulane who helps the poor; a host of other delightful supporting cameo-roles; and of course, the quiet American himself - John Wayne, playing Sean Thornton, returning to his birthplace from the steel-mills of Pittsburgh.John Wayne must have really enjoyed making this film, which was such a departure from his more usual cowboy films. He fitted the part very well. Apparently he really was half-Irish, which must have given this film a special meaning for him. Anyway, he played Sean Thornton to the hilt, showing what a good actor he was.Maureen O'Hara is also a total delight and thoroughly believable: I shall always associate Maureen with this film, and I like to think that she enjoyed making it too! And when that much hoped-for fight between Sean Thornton and Red Will finally does take place, it gets even the dying on their feet and out on the streets to watch! This film is a total delight from start to finish, possessing a unique charm that the passage of years can never diminish.",

As a result he pulls away from violence and this poises an issue when he returns to Ireland to reclaim his family's farm. Maureen O'Hara plays a local woman whom Wayne falls for but her brother is an overbearing bully who is angry at him after being out bid in the land auction. He becomes a divider in the relationship to come. John Ford and John Wayne have collaborated through numerous films, including Stagecoach, but here Wayne has a seemingly different role as someone who regrets a violent past yet is unfairly taking hits from O'Hara and her brother. She marries Wayne but becomes obsessed with the money that is owed her by her brother. She constantly berates him until he finally takes charge in what becomes a very long haul. Great supporting roles particularly by Victor McLaglen as the brother who ends up being dealt with through a fist fight that derails the film from greatness. This fight turns the drama into a corny showcase that doesn't fit the mode of the first two acts. Ward Bond plays a Catholic Priest who also gets involved in the scheme at hand. In any event Ford delivers a message loud and clear of pride and standing up for oneself. Score: 8 / 10",

John Wayne shows depth and timing, while Maureen O'Hara demonstrates to the likes of Jennifer Aniston what real acting ability, great looks and star quality are all about. John Ford directs with a sure hand for overplaying the ridiculous oirishness (even the IRA drink in the same bar as retired English generals!) and the lush portrayal of a mostly sunny West Coast of Ireland (with plenty of songs like 'Wild Colonial Boy!'). But it does go over the top, and the cynics will lambast its far too obvious wearing of its heart on its sleeve and sometimes lack of subtlety. But it works, mostly, and does unintentionally show how backward rural Ireland was under De Valera - it could almost pass for 1916 in 'Ryan's Daughter.'",

            "content": "It's a clich\u00e9 to say, about a movie especially, that \"they don't make 'em like that anymore.\" But in the case of The Quiet Man, a gentle comedy drama from John Ford, they really don't. If it was made today, this romantic tale set in the luscious green countryside of Ireland would no doubt star some square-jawed pretty-boy as the male lead, with the role of the leading lady going to some vacuous up-and-comer hoping to make the transition from TV into film before fading into utter obscurity. Back in 1952 they got two of cinema's Golden Age powerhouses, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, who sizzle with chemistry, charisma and charm, combining to help create one of the finest films of its time.Something of a departure for Ford and Wayne, who were most famous for delivering tough horse operas in the Old West, the film was only made by Republic Picture on the promise that Ford make a western for them first to make up for question mark looming over the box-office appeal of The Quiet Man. He obliged and made Rio Grande (1950), before setting off for Ireland to make the passion project he purchased the movie rights to back in the 1930's. He brought Wayne with him too, but he would kill no injuns and saddle no horses (although he does get to briefly ride one) here, but instead play Sean Thornton, the 'quiet man' of the title - a dashing, friendly American who retreats to his birthplace of Ireland carrying a dark secret on his shoulders.Soon upon arriving, Sean is struck by the beauty of the temperamental Mary Kate Danaher (O'Hara), the sister of landowner Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLagen). When Sean quickly purchases the cottage in which he was born, he finds himself immediately at odds with the loud-mouthed and brutish Will, who has had his eyes on the land for years. Sean and Mary Kate are soon in love, but Will stubbornly refuses to consent to the marriage. Local drunk and matchmaker Michaleen (Barry Fitzgerald), sympathising with the two lovers, hatches a plan with the other locals to manipulate Will into thinking the marriage is in his best interests, and they are soon wed. But when Will uncovers the plot and tries to sabotage the marriage, Sean must face the demons of his past and confront the bullying tyrant.Winner of 2 Academy Awards and nominated for 5 more, The Quiet Man was a roaring success and is loved by many to this day, but was undoubtedly a massive gamble by Ford. People paid to see John Wayne punch bad guys and get the girl, but this was a film about a man who makes an active decision not to fight and, although he gets the girl early on, he struggles to keep a hold of her. Funnily enough, this is one of Wayne's best performances, a rare opportunity to see his warmer, gentler side, and his interaction with O'Hara, who is also terrific, is one of the movie's main strengths. The slow pace pays off at the end, climaxing with one of the best fist-fights in cinema. It's played mainly for laughs and no one draws blood, but the absurdity and the sheer length of it is a hoot. Perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.",

If you have read it, then you'd immediately have found out that the whole movie was cast with absolutely wrong cast, John Wayne was not in the least as what the short story had portrayed as the man, Sean Thornton, not even close in 100 miles.Sean Thornton, in the story, was indeed a very quiet man, a professional boxer retired from New York boxing ring, seeking an even quieter retirement life back to his hometown in Ireland. He was a tough guy, very reserved and at the same time very humble but with a very strong mind and will.But the screenplay writer and the director, John Ford, had messed up the whole lot and changed it into a farce-like light-heart comedy. It lost the depth of the great short story with a very deep and profound atmosphere which made the short story kind of memorable and an instant classic.\"The Quiet Man\" and \"The Most Dangerous Game\" are the two most famous and modern classic, the reasons why both of these two short stories had become so great was the unbelievable and unbearable tension in both. Yet the movie of \"The Quiet Man\" was a loud, noisy, skin-deep shallow comedy without essence at all.Victor McLaglen who played the Squire 'Red' Will Danaher, was definitely another wrong cast. In the story, the guy was a very tough, dark, stubborn, self-righteous, and dangerous, an egoist and willful strong minded tough guy. But the movie had transformed him into a half wit redneck-like thug. So with both important and memorable characters that made the short story so great had been molested into two shallow guys, Sean Thornton had become a loud mouth, always with an ironic sneering smile on his face guy, also a bit too old for the leading role. Squire 'Red', just a countryside rustic roughneck. Neither of them got something special.Maureen O'Hara, who played Mary Kate Danaher, was the only cast that was kinda close to what portrayed in the short story. But in the messy shallow movie, totally ruined by the two wrong male characters, lousy directing and a deep drama-like great storyline messed up into a half farce, half comedy, only one of the cast was barely okay, would not turned this pathetic movie around into a much greater and more memorable one.",

In some ways, this astonishingly beautiful, humane film stands as Ford's Chef de Ouvre.It is deeply misunderstood by those critics who decry its \"unrealistic\" picture of Ireland. Such criticism is misleading, and not simply because the fantastic elements of the films plot. In fact, the film conceals  sharp ironies beneath  its pastoral, romantic, surface. Yes, Ford does celebrate his pre-industrial Irish community-its rituals, celebrations, and lore. At the same time, he is fully aware of the human costs and limitations of the community he celebrates.Religious, economic, and sexual conflict simmers beneath the surface.In fact, the whole film centers on a complex problem of economic and sexual exchange-The Dowry. In addition, Waynes \"quiet man\" is a tormented, alienated figure, trying to recover his identity as a human being by returning to his native home.The conflicts however, are resolved comically, rather than tragically.The climactic  fight between Wayne and McLaglen is one of the greatest scenes in all of world cinema, superbly shot and edited,and interspersed with comic vignettes( the bet between the two Protestant clergymen, the retired Colonel calmly reading his newspaper  as the battle swirls around him, the Priest reading  to the dying man, not from the Christian scriptures, but from an Irish pagan epic.)In short, this film is superb. Ford deserved his Oscar, and John Wayne surely should have been nominated for one,as well as the magnificent Maureen O'Hara.",

The result not only produced one of Republic's highest grossing pictures, but it also earned a Best Director for the veteran Ford.I enjoyed the understated humor throughout the picture, particularly with the character of Michaleen Oge Flynn portrayed by Barry Fitzgerald. He had that great line about 'playing patty fingers with the holy water' and fairly bristled at the idea that America had a period of Prohibition. That his horse Napoleon automatically stopped at the door of Pat Cohan's pub was a very clever gimmick.Ward Bond was a surprise here, he's a trip as the parish priest Father Lonergan on a ten year mission to land the big one down at the fishing creek. Another Ford regular, Victor McLaglen also shows considerable range as the feisty brother of O'Hara's Mary Kate. I've generally seen him in more one dimensional roles, so his performance here garnered a well deserved Supporting Actor nomination.The film probably has a tough time finding support among modern day viewers considering it's subject matter and the way the main characters treat each other. I think the viewer ought to hold those thoughts to one side and consider the story from the vantage point of the era and the customs and mores of different cultures. Set among the sunny and vibrant colors of the Irish countryside, \"The Quiet Man\" is a genuine treat that movie fans can appreciate for it's fine acting and colorful characters coming to grips with the conflicts they seek to overcome.",

Basically Sean Thornton (John Wayne) is the disgraced boxer who has returned from America to his homeland of Ireland to escape his past. He catches the eye of beautiful, poor maiden Mary Kate Danaher (Miracle on 34th Street's Maureen O'Hara), and younger sister of nasty Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Oscar nominated Victor McLaglen). Sean and Mary Kate's relationship builds, even with Will's attempts to keep them apart, but Sean's past does come to haunt him eventually. Also starring Barry Fitzgerald as Michaleen Flynn, Ward Bond as Father Peter Lonergan, Mildred Natwick as Mrs. Sarah Tillane - The Widow, Francis Ford as Dan Tobin, Eileen Crowe as Mrs. Elizabeth Playfair, May Craig as Fishwoman with Basket at Station, Arthur Shields as Rev. Dr. Cyril 'Snuffy' Playfair and Charles B. Fitzsimons as Hugh Forbes. Wayne is a good lead, and the on location filming in Ireland makes for some good sights, but the critics say that you have to be in a certain mood to watch this film, maybe I wasn't in it, because I can't see why they give it the full five out of five, I'm not saying it isn't good, I just don't think it's that good. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Score for Victor Young. John Wayne was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and the film was number 76 on 100 Years, 100 Passions. Very good!",

First of all, I cannot tell whether it is supposed to be a comedy or a drama.\"The Quiet Man\" is a reference to Wayne's character, Sean Thorton, an ex-boxer who swears off violence against men (but not against women) following the tragic death of his opponent in the ring. Thorton decides to return to his birthplace in Ireland, where he hopes to live in anonymity in the house where he was born.Within minutes of arriving, he meets Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) and her brother, William Dahaher (Victor McLaglen). Mary Kate is the local spitfire, the kind of woman who drives both men and women away from her with her sharp tongue. Will Danaher is also interested in Thorton's birth home, as well as in the widow who currently owns it. However, Thorton wins out in the bid for the home, and Danaher takes his revenge on Thorton by forbidding him from courting Mary Kate (he later changes his mind when the local matchmaker assures him that the widow will accept Will's marriage proposal as soon as Will moves Mary Kate out of his house). After establishing the tragic circumstances under which Thorton returns to Ireland, and allowing the audience to share in Mary Kate's frustration at being denied a husband by her brother, the movie seems to be trying to evolve into a comedy. After a very brief courting period, during which Thorton and Mary Kate show their shared rebellious streaks by escaping their chaperon, our hero and heroine are married. However, Will, having now realized the trick played by the matchmaker, refuses to give the couple Mary Kate's dowry. Thorton, who is determined not to confront anyone and provoke a fight, takes the position that the dowry is not important, but Mary Kate wants what rightfully belongs to her. When Thorton refuses to fight for her, she decides to leave him. Rather than see his wife's point of view, Thorton decides to \"assert himself\" by throwing Mary Kate around like a sack of potatoes, first around their bedroom, then around the Irish countryside. Mary Kate's response to his rough treatment is to develop a new found respect for him; evidence that Neanderthal behavior sometimes gets the girl. After all, if it worked for Rhett Butler, why not for Sean Thorton.Of course, in defense of John Ford's treatment of this \"love story\", the idea that violence against certain women is acceptable still prevails in film. The female protagonist who can take anything that a man can dish out still finds her way on to the screen. Back then, like now, tough girls like Mary Kate Danaher Thorton take the blows with little sympathy. The message that Wayne's character and Ford's direction convey is the message evidently present in many of Wayne's pictures, nonviolence gets you nowhere, and what women respect is a strong, domineering man. While I am not one of those women who is offended by every film that shows a woman doing \"traditional\" work or having a soft-spoken personality, I think that the message that this film gives overrides any charming qualities that Ford thought the film might possess. This may have been a love letter to Ireland, which some have suggested, but it was written with a poison pen.",

The plot is simple enough: Sean Thornton (John Wayne), a disgraced Irish-American boxer retires to the hometown he was born in back in Ireland years ago and falls in love with a pretty maid, Mary Kate Danaher (O'Hara), whose regionally powerful brother is at pain to consent to the marriage. In overcoming this conflict, Thornton must come to grips with his past to move on to his future.It's nothing particularly groundbreaking or meaningful, but it is well-played and well-executed. The movie, however, is entirely dependent on the ambiance: the Ireland it shows us is, to steal from the words of Srdja Trifkovic, \"pre-modern, almost annoyingly so.\" The community life and of course community conspiracies, the porter in the bars, the spontaneous singing, the resolving of disputes through fighting without maiming, the modesty and beauty of the women, the veneer submission of women to their husbands when it is actually the former who wield all the strings... it's all here, and it's all done well.Apparently Ireland was, once upon a time, like that, and memories of that Ireland live on strong with Irish-Americans. Indeed, \"The Quiet Man\" was a refreshing piece to see after I had already visited Ireland and experienced first-hand what it has become. True, Ireland was not the idyllic place Irish-Americans want to believe or that John Ford depicted, but even this latter seems conscious of the reality, for commentators of Sean's and Mary Kate's new home remark that, \"Every Irish cottage should look like this!\"I wouldn't call \"The Quiet Man\" a romantic work, per se; it doesn't quite have that expat nostalgia that would be required for a romantic piece on the subject of an Irish-American emigrating to Ireland. \"Stylized realism\" is perhaps more appropriate for what this is. In the era of mass, multinational deracination, such ambient films are essential to keep on the shelf to remind us how to recognize real soil and properly control our growth.Let us look to something higher, now...",

It's that by-now well-known-yet-simple story of an American fighter (John Wayne as Sean \"Trooper Thorn\" Thornton) retiring across the sea to the village of his ancestors awash in magical, mythical sentimentality and Irish tradition that also helps mightily. It's the astonishingly beautiful Technicolor cinematography of Winton Hoch and second unit director Archie Stout, who two decades earlier filmed most of the Duke's earliest two-reelers for Lone Star Productions up around Lone Pine at the foot of the High Sierras, that help make the film what it is. It's the John Ford Stock Company: Ward Bond as the priest, Arthur Shoelds as the Protestant minister, Mildred Natwick as the richest widow in town, Ken Curtis as the local with the tenor of gold, and of course, Victor McLaglen as the antagonist, the brother-in-law performing roles they were born to play. The characters, down to the smallest role, all magically come to life.And finally, it's the chemistry of two marvelous Irish actors, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara that are the icing on this cake.

She thinks he's not manly enough because he won't fight her brother and village bully, played by the obnoxious Victor McLaglen, who is keeping her rightful dowry from her. He's irritated at her for being obsessed with money and not thinking that him and their simple life together is enough. Neither ever seems to consider just sitting down and talking about their respective feelings, or justifying why they feel the way they do, so we're treated to over two hours of a one-note joke as O'Hara acts like a child and Wayne gets his patience tested. The ending is fun, there's catharsis in watching Wayne finally lose his patience and drag the petulant O'Hara across a field, and the pastoral Irish settings make it a beautiful and relaxing movie to look at. But I do have to admit I was left wondering why I bothered investing so much time in a movie that came to so little.In addition to Ford's Oscar, the film brought Winton Hoch and Archie Stout that year's Oscar for Best Color Cinematography.

Countless generations of immigrants want to pay homage to their homelands, and that's what Ford and Wayne and all the other crew members do. This is a beautiful film, with glorious shots of the Irish countryside and village life. It's also a romantic comedy, and never before or since have we seen the great John Wayne so utterly manipulated by a woman. Maureen O'Hara is magnificent, magisterial, a force of nature.

            "content": "If you ask most people alive today what the \"legacy\" of actor John Wayne will forever be, they will most likely respond \"a swaggering, confident cowboy who always defeated the bad guys and rode off into the sunset\". Though a good portion of his films (Rio Bravo, El Dorado, The Sons of Katie Elder, etc.) followed that very theme, the Duke's REAL legacy is the nuanced roles he played so well, not the standard Western fare.Just think back to some of Wayne's best screen performances and what types of characters he played: -Red River (Thomas Dunson; threatens to kill his adoptive son) -The Searchers (Ethan Edwards; nearly murders his little niece in cold blood) -The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (Tom Doniphon; a psychological mess by the end of the film) -True Grit (Rooster Cogburn; a tottering old drunk who, at times, can hardly stay on his horse)Clearly, Wayne actually thrived as an actor when not stereotyped as the heroic cowboy, and his performance in \"The Quiet Man\" only serves to advance that sentiment.In \"Quiet Man\", Wayne plays Sean Thornton, a seemingly retiring fellow who is returning to his hometown of Innisfree in Ireland. While there, he meets the woman of his dreams, Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), and tries to start a new life for himself after being disgraced in the United States as a boxer who killed a fellow pugilist in the ring. However, Thornton quickly discovers that the courting customs in Innisfree are radically different from those in the States, as he must first persuade Mary Kate's brother, Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen), to give up his sister's hand in marriage.While that brief plot description above pretty much describes the gist of the film, leaving it at that would be like saying The Searchers was just about cowboys and Indians. In typical John Ford (director) fashion, this film is filled with nuances that can only be caught after multiple viewings. Whether it be Wayne's reactions to the extremely odd dating rituals, or the strange characters he meets while getting reacquainted with Innisfree, Ford fills the picture with all kinds of little trivialities and inside jokes.Not only that, but the acting and music in this film are spectacular. Wayne and O'Hara turn in what some may consider to be their strongest acting performances every (or, at the very least, their strongest together), while the rest of the cast is full of funny and interesting characters. Add to that an incredible score that captures the Irish roots of the film, and you really do have a film for the ages. By the time Sean Thornton makes his trip through town in advance of his final confrontation with Will Danaher, you will be rooting him on every step of the way.Some time ago, my Dad started a tradition of viewing \"The Quiet Man\" once a year...on (or very near) St. Patrick's Day, in keeping with the film's Irish bend. I was a participant in that annual tradition not too long ago, and let's just say that I will be continuing it into the future.",

During the Golden Age of Hollywood, he and John Wayne made more than a dozen so-called \"horse operas\" together. But in 1952, John Ford brought \"the Duke\" to Europe to make a different kind of movie.In \"The Quiet Man\", John Wayne portrays a boxer who returns home to Ireland after his career. He has bought a small cottage in his childhood village, and now intends to spend the rest of his life in peace and quiet. Although after falling in love with a red-haired, Irish beauty (played by Maureen O'Hara), his life becomes anything but peaceful.The movie was based on a short story written by a certain Maurice Hall. After reading it in the \"Saturday Evening Post\" in 1933, John Ford bought the rights for $10. When it became clear that the film would actually be made, an additional $6,250 was paid to the writer.The big fight in the film has become legendary. In reality, however, Viktor McLaglen was almost 66 years old and in poor health, so his brawl with John Wayne had to be carefully staged.The production was financed by the small company Republic Pictures. Normally, they mainly dealt with low-budget B-movies, but after John Ford promised them an action-packed reel with crowd favorite John Wayne, they decided to splash out for once. And it worked. \"The Quiet Man\" was a big success at the box office.The film also earned John Ford his fourth Academy Award for Best Director. He had previously won for \"The Informer\", \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and \"How Green Was My Valley\". A record that still stands today.

Unfortunately the peculiar 1930s Irish mating rituals make his pursuit of the young lass oh so very complicated. You can't just blow into town and sweep a girl off her feet. There are rules and procedures to be followed. And should he ultimately succeed in making this woman his wife? Well, again there will be more peculiar 1930s Irish customs to get in the way of the happily ever afters. But heck, it's Maureen O'Hara, she's worth the trouble.To appreciate and understand The Quiet Man one has to realize that this is a story set in a very specific place and time. The place is one of the best things the movie has going for it as director John Ford brilliantly captures the breathtaking Irish scenery. The film looks absolutely spectacular. But where the place works the time is a bit more problematic. The customs of the 1930s period in which the story unfolds are so antiquated, and often so bizarre, that there's a bit of an uneasy feeling for the modern viewer. Often the story just does not seem believable. But in that particular time in that particular place that's the way things were. Once you accept that you can embrace the story which certainly has its charms.For once John Wayne gets to play somebody other than, well, John Wayne. His character of Sean Thornton, an American returning to his Irish birthplace, is in many ways so different from the part Wayne typically played. John Wayne, the hopeless romantic? Well, maybe not to that extreme but it's certainly a departure for Duke. But there's still some John Wayne in Sean Thornton. Sean's tough and rugged and strong-minded. And in Mary Kate Danaher he meets his match. This is a woman who can give as good as she gets. Of course the fact that the character is played by Maureen O'Hara who is as talented as she is beautiful certainly helps. She can stand toe to toe with John Wayne and the relationship between their two characters is fascinating to watch. It's a relationship of fits and starts with obstacles constantly being thrown up in Sean and Mary Kate's way. The biggest obstacle coming in the personage of Mary Kate's brother Will who, in the 1930s Irish way, can stop this union dead in its tracks if he wants to. And he most definitely wants to do just that. That is the conflict which largely drives the movie forward. But if the relationship between our would-be lovers is one of fits and starts so often is the movie itself. There are times when it struggles to maintain its momentum, times when the old-fashioned story is a little too old-timey for its own good. But it's charming throughout, right up to the big climax which sadly is a bit of a letdown. The movie deserved a better ending than the final confrontation which goes on so long that it all becomes a bit silly. For whatever disappointments there may be though there is enough here to make you look back on the film fondly. Wayne and O'Hara are terrific, and ably supported by a fine cast around them. The story has its flaws but it holds your attention throughout. And the film is shot so beautifully. The only thing more breathtaking than the Irish countryside may well be the Irish woman who stars in this memorable film.",

Winner of two Oscars (Ford as director and cinematography) plus two venerable and charismatic actors providing much of the irascible blarney - veteran Ford regular Victor McLaglen, though always playing Irish is actually from Kent, England and Barry Fitzgerald as the matchmaking tippler.If you've holidayed in Ireland, as I have, then that's a nice bonus as it brings back memories and, in for instance, the horse racing scene on the beach, the vast empty sands are a far cry to my jam-packed nearby beaches on the south coast. The scenery in this isn't always sunny and glossy - it's often a bit glum, with rain - this isn't a picture postcard from the Emerald Isle, but a rich slice of Irish life.John Wayne is measured and sedate as ex boxer Sean Thornton, who has some demons to conquer when he's continually goaded into a fight. Once he gets over them, the fisticuffs at the end are brilliantly - and amusingly staged and well worth waiting for. Maureen O'Hara is as radiant as ever and, dare I say it, the Duke actually looks comfortable as her suitor.My DVD copy (part of a 3 DVD set, with Rooster Cogburn and Stagecoach) is rather poor quality with a magenta fringe at times and rather a soft definition. I can't say whether transfer's differ for different releases. This does spoil one's enjoyment a bit but the strength of the film easily shines through.",

            "content": "In 1941, John Ford directed one of his best and most personal movies: \"How Green Was My Valley\" it was also his only Best Picture.The film was a nostalgic ride over a Welsh mining town shot in all black-and-white so both of the titular green and Maureen O'Hara fiery red hair were left to our imagination. The monochrome choice had also the merit to camouflage the Californian setting, as war made any overseas shooting impossible.Interestingly, despite the 'Welsh' cultural mark, the film was also a tribute to Ford's Irish ancestry. He even challenged purists by having many Irish actors play Welsh characters. It is possible that Ford thought this was the closest he would get to his roots so he let his sentimental self take the command of the camera. In 1951, he finally had the opportunity to honor Eire by adapting short story by Maurice Walsh, whose rights were bought in the early 30s.But how can one possibly imagine a tribute to Ireland in black-and-white or devoid of that so particular green? The Emerald Isle was a jewelry box out of which John Ford had to forge a gem... and it was \"The Quiet Man\", a film of temper and tenderness... and for once, a really green valley! You just can't cheat with the old country especially since no war has raised its ugly head to prevent Ford from taking a long vacation and bring his long-time partner John Wayne and the beautiful Maureen O'Hara for what would be one of his signature films.With \"The Quiet Man\", John Ford finally proves his statement right as he said: \"None of my so called better pictures are westerns.\" I've enjoyed many of his Westerns but I admired the non-Western ones for the temperament they deployed without any fancy directing or elaborate storytelling, Ford just knew how to get the right effects. And \"The Quiet Man\" for that matter puts you immediately at ease, like the first sips of a pint of Guinness.Though the opening credits use a beautiful coastal view under a bright sunset, the film doesn't lay the green color at first but starts with the stranger's homecoming. Sean Thornton, the American coming back to his native Ireland and asking for a village named Insfree, a simple question that sets the tone and invite the first chuckles. So we'll deal with the colorful and sentimental Ireland and John Wayne didn't come to kick some ass or start some quarrel. In this appeasing mood, we appreciate his welcoming by the elfin-like Michaeleen played by the irresistible Barry Fitzgerald.The town's matchmaker (and occasional bookmaker) discovers that the big hunk of a man (one foot taller) is the little Sean he saw grow up and move to Pittsburgh, back to claim the land that belonged to his deceased parents, determined to start a new life in the green cradle. The exposition allows us to encounter in once all the players of that farcical melodrama. Ward Bond is the town priest. Catching Sean's eye is Maureen O'Hara as Mary Kate Danaher, the turbulent sister of Squire Will Danaher, a loud-mouthed self-centered bully (a scene-stealing over-the-top,Victor McLaglen) who won't have any outsider stepping on his territory, let alone the land he intends to buy from the rich Widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick).This will obviously complicate the love story going between Sean and Mary Kate, till marriage and even beyond. There might be bar brawls and big fistfights but maybe because there's always something worth all these shenanigans and deep inside, the Irish people are all proud of their traditions. Sean Thornton will learn at his expenses why America might have some roots in Ireland but is not Ireland. And it takes some great deal of courage from Wayne to play the part of a man branded as coward because in this cultural immersion.Of course he has his reasons and we know it's only a matter of time before the two distinguished gentlemen let the fists talk but \"The Quiet Man\" hides behind its comedic and romantic fa\u00e7ade a great deal of knowledge about Ireland's traditions and the way they forged the temperament of many Americans whether born in the country or in America. There are many parts in the film that would be considered politically incorrect by our standards, but who would dare to call Wayne abusive or O'Hara submissive? The couple is certainly not mismatched when it comes to principles.Some would take a dowry as a symbol of oppressive patriarchy but Mary Kate isn't concerned with the money but what it represents, her emancipation, she's unchained by an institution like everyone else but not her free will. It's actually the men who learn humbling lessons in the film as if sometimes, one should consider the value of traditions before embracing everything from the modernity. Well, it's possible that the film has a few chauvinistic undertones but they never to be taken seriously, and well, sometimes the old-fashioned ways have their charm, and d it's precisely because a movie like \"The Quiet Man\" aged a lot that it feels so new and exhilarating.Ever since I discovered Ireland, I had a soft spot for that country and I envy those who have that tradition pumping in their blood, not denying mine of course, but it's a credit to John Ford to have made such a beautiful tribute to Ireland, visually and musically (that Victor Young's theme) that it probably made a few viewers, secretly wish they would be Irish.And just because nothing dramatic affects the film doesn't mean it's not entertaining and even thrilling in its own way, it's as quiet as its hero, calm and comprehensive on the surface but has with a few tricks under its sleeve... and knows how to make your heart pound, your jaw drop and your belly laugh!",

It is perhaps one of John Wayne's best films as well as perhaps the best film by director John Ford. And it's not even a western! If you've never seen the film it's the story of Sean Thornton (Wayne) who returns to the small village in Ireland where he grew up as a child to purchase the home he grew up in. Met by Michaleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) he isn't recognized but they soon become friends. Michaleen is basically the cab driver in town with his horse and carriage as well as a matchmaker of sorts.That comes into play when Sean catches a glimpse of Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara). Call it love at first sight the two are attracted by social customs of the time being what they are aren't allowed to meet. A bigger problem arises after Sean purchases his home to the dismay of Squire \"Red\" Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen), Mary Kate's brother who wanted the property for himself.When the town conspires to unite the young couple by tricking Will his anger takes over and he attempts to block their getting together. They do and eventually marry but Will refuses to pay Sean Mary Kate's dowry. While Sean could care less Mary Kate refuses to sleep with him until he takes care of the matter.What the townsfolk don't know, with one exception, is that Sean has refused to fight for a reason. When that final straw breaks the camel's back and he's had enough he changes his tune. All of this leads to a final showdown between the two men and one of the longest fight sequences ever put on film.The movie is a delight to watch over and over again. The performances are amazing to watch with all involved, from the smallest to largest roles, creating believable characters that you get mad at, laugh at and love by the end of the film. There are no truly small roles here.Ford creates not just a story but a setting that was familiar to him and the way he forms the combination of location and tale being told make it a location you'd love to visit. He brings his old Irish home to life for all to see and enjoy. The film is glorious to look at with some breathtaking scenery shot on location.With the numerous versions of this film released over the years why talk about it now and why discuss buying this latest edition? That's because Olive Films has come up with one of the best presentations of the film to date. As a part of their Signature Series the film has been mastered from a 4k scan of the original negative, offering the cleanest look the film has ever had.It also includes some interesting extras as well. Those include an audio commentary with John Ford biographer Joseph McBride, a tribute to Maureen O'Hara with Ally Sheedy, Hayley Mills, and Juliet Mills, DON'T YOU REMEMBER IT SEAN?: JOHN FORD AND THE QUIET MAN a visual essay by historian and John Ford expert Tag Gallagher, FREE REPUBLIC: THE STORY OF HERBERT J. YATES AND REPUBLIC PICTURES, THE OLD MAN: REMEMBERING JOHN FORD an appreciation of the director with Peter Bogdanovich and THE MAKING OF THE QUIET MAN written and hosted by Leonard Maltin.This is not just a movie to pick up and watch casually but one to enjoy over and over again. You'll find yourself cheering at the screen by the final sequence. You'll witness a beautiful love story filled with romance and a touch of humor. And you'll get to see one of the best movies ever made.",

The Quiet Man was a fun ride actually but i didn't expect it to be the one as i always seek for some quality work from John Ford. Here, John Ford wanted to have fun and so did i had fun too. What's more than that? Nothing. Just nothing. The Quiet Man was looking so good in the first 70 minutes when there's Homeland, Romance, Weeding but later it gets little sloppy due to unnecessary demands of the woman in the film. At one moment it looked like making a sense because the Dowry might have been more important for an Irish bride but scolding nice loving husband for that doesn't make any sense at all. As an addition to the senseless things the film suddenly turns over-funny and chaotic in the climax and i just felt like, What? Seriously, this was all they wanted since the beginning? All that beautiful romance, feelings for homeland were Just for the sake chaos in climax? The Quiet Man could have had better perception, for instance it could have been a well made love story or a woman's film but all they got to do is Irishmen laughters. And like I said i know nothing about Ireland culture so it never took me along. May be this is just made for the sake of Fun and I was mistakenly expecting something else. John Ford won Best Director Award at Oscars i am happy for him. John Wayne was good in lead role and Maureen O'hara looks gorgeous as redhead irish girl. The cinematography and locations are eye pleasing. That's it. Nothing more to say than i had fun but i am disappointed.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "This is a wonderful movie, though not the typical western of actor John Wayne or director John Ford. Rather it's sort of an Irish rendition of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, as others have also noted. Here we have the idyllic green Irish countryside, lovely Irish brogues, traditional Irish melodies, an engaging story, a touching romance, and some very compelling characters. This film delightfully blends comedy, romance, and drama...all three.The tale revolves around a former prizefighter, Sean Thornton, who has retired from boxing after accidentally killing a man in the ring. He was born in Innisfree but moved to America as a toddler. Upon returning to Ireland to buy the cottage where he was born and hopefully find peace, he glimpses a beautiful woman herding sheep in a meadow. He soon falls in love with this fiery Irish lass, Mary Kate Danaher, the town spinster and younger sister of the village bully, Squire 'Red' Will Danaher. Sean and Mary Kate marry, though against the wishes of Kate's older brother who wanted Sean's land for himself. When Will refuses to provide her dowry, Mary Kate insists that her husband fight her brother, forcing him to bestow what is rightfully theirs. Sean refuses because of his past boxing experiences, causing wild havoc in his marriage with this feisty spitfire. Mary Kate wants Sean to fight for her and that's all there is to it. Of course she is unaware of his past traumatic experience in the ring and simply believes her husband is a coward. No spoilers here as to whether Sean agrees to fight in order to gain his wife's respect. Suffice it to say that meanwhile, the townsfolk are all spoiling to see a brawl between Sean and his new brother-in-law. This is surely one of John Wayne's most sympathetic and endearing roles, here playing Sean Thornton, the ex boxer with the troubled past. The Irish born Maureen O'Hara is perfectly cast as the barefoot Mary Kate, a spunky lass with a fierce determination of her own. Their courtship on screen is sensuous, a sight to behold with its legendary windy kiss scene. Yes indeed, John Wayne is a a man who knows how to kiss a woman!In my opinion, complaints about spousal mistreatment in this movie are a bit of nonsense. Remember that when a villager offers Sean a stick to beat his wife, he throws it away even though he is livid with her at the time. It's the wife who gets her way here! Sean has his work cut out dealing with this spirited, strong willed lady who insists that her husband adapt to her culture, not the other way around. This is really quite a whimsical, entertaining, and uplifting gem, a true classic. I heartily agree with another's comment that it would make great St. Patrick's Day viewing. Surely this is Ireland at its most Irish.",

            "content": "A slice of the old country, the little people and the blarney is very much enjoyed in The Quiet Man. It's essentially a western set in Western Ireland but has all the beautiful detail one expects in Ford films.The plot follows that of the classic John Ford western meets Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew.Stranger comes to town. Falls for the sister of the town's most powerful man who is also a tough fighting man. Conflict arises between stranger and local tough guy. A further conflict occurs between feisty femme and the stranger. The inevitable showdown happens. And the good guy wins the fight and tames the woman's spirit and thus wins her heart.The plot may sound basic, but the beauty of this film is in great locations, fine performances and a cracking script with plenty of the Irish humour and charm.Director Ford may only have had one eye and glasses but seemed to see much more than most with two eyes and 20-20 vision. It's his eye for the detail that make this movie especially memorable. Throughout the movie you feel like you are in the west of Ireland, almost one of the locals of Innisfree as you go inside the pub, the humble cottage, the church, the farmhouses and join the locals in the rolling greenery of the Irish countryside.The first confrontation between Sean Thornton (superbly played by John Wayne) and Red Will Danaher (equally good stuff from Victor McLaglan) has almost everything.The romance of the quaint Irish pub, the friendliness of the locals once Sean Thornton's identity has been revealed and the music starts - Wild Colonial Boy sung by none other than country and western singer Ken Curtis - Ford's real life son in law as the accordion playing Dermot Fahy. It hardly gets more Irish than this.Enter Red Will looking for fight. The punchy dialogue follows \"I said good morning\" Sean declares. \"Yeah but it was good night you had in your mind\" Red Will accuses Sean of making an ungentlemanly pass at his sister Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara). The tension mounts.Ford's real life brother Francis Ford plays an old man in the pub and is central to this early scene - acting almost like a referee in between the two hulks of Sean and Red Will. In the end religious intervention in the form of the unlikely but convincing Ward Bond's Fr Lonnigan prevents a full-blown fistfight. But it is only delaying the inevitable. The tone is set.Ford assembled his usual supporting team to deliver this genuine movie treat. Maureen O'Hara who plays Mary Kate Danaher is at her radiant feisty best and probably never looked more beautiful in a movie. Then there is Barry Fitzgerald whose character is part leprechaun, part barfly and as the movie progresses he pops up as a jack of all trades - taxi service, matchmaker, bookmaker and even furniture removal man. He steals many scenes with his cheeky charm and his presence certainly adds to the myth that leprechauns may exist.It's certainly one of Ford's finest and has an epic fight at the end, which is not brutal, but merely cartoon violence that Tarantino would be proud of.So with wild Irish humour, accordion and loud piano music, jaunty pub songs, meaty confrontations, flames of red haired Irish folk and a big village to village fight, you might ask why this film is called The Quiet Man? Well here's the real conflict and the great irony of the title. Sean Thornton is a retired boxer and has returned to his hometown of Innisfree from Pittsburgh to enjoy \"the quiet life\". He gets anything but tranquillity and has to emerge from his conscience, morals and indeed motives, to fight for the right to have a quiet life and a beautiful wife (Maureen O'Hara) who is a shrew needing tamed as she prods her man to fight for her pride.The Quiet Man is a classic and one of Ford's standouts among his amazing canon of great work. He shows us a vibrant Ireland at it's finest in a movie that never tires. This is must for the DVD collection and whenever you're feeling down. Just insert disc, press play and let the great John Ford take you to the Emerald Isle and all it's wonderful wild romance.",

He didn't have the look of an American tourist at all about him. Not a camera on him; what was worse, not even a fishin' rod.\" So begins \"The Quiet Man\", John Fords labour of love that turned a twee tale of Irish blarney into one of cinema's most passionate romances. When the Irish-American boxer Sean Thornton (John Wayne) kills an opponent in the ring, he returns home to the small rural village of his birth where he immediately purchases his old family cottage... An act that leads to him incurring the wrath of local squire Red Danaher (Victor McLagen). Their feud is escalated when Sean meets Danahers feisty, beautiful sister Mary-Kate (Maureen O'Hara) and they quickly embark upon a tempestuous romance. The assorted locals conspire in this courtship but the stubborn Danaher continues to block the road to happiness. With such flamboyant stock character actors as Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald and Mildred Natwick on typically barnstorming form, what Ford presents here is a loving, charming depiction of the whimsical rural Ireland of his imagination. An idealised homeland full of larger than life characters, strong women, hard-drinking men and innocent parochial religion and a place where and all disputes can be happily resolved with a fistfight. And boy what a fistfight! Words such as \"lyrical\" and \"mythic\" are often applied to the directors work and this was probably never more apparent than here. From the first sighting of Mary-Kate in the tree encircled glade through to the final secretive whisper between man and wife, there can be few films as brimming with undiluted joie de vivre as \"The Quiet Man\".",

The beautiful green meadows in Technicolor are some of the most famous aspects of the film.The other, much more famous part of the movie is the famous kiss scene between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. You've probably seen it; the wind is blowing fiercely around them and Maureen slaps his face so hard she actually broke her wrist during the take. After such a feisty refusal, she tells him off in true Irish style, then kisses him back. It's a very cute scene, one that's often cited among the greatest of onscreen romances.The rest of the movie centers on John and Maureen's romance, her family's objections, and the disapproval of an American in the small Irish village. There's a pretty famous fistfight that comes from The Quiet Man, and John and Maureen continue to trade blows throughout the film, but it's far from the typical western you'd normally find John Wayne in.

            "content": "John Ford is an interesting director nowadays, because while his influence is undeniable, many of his movies haven't aged as ideally as work from some of the other filmmakers of his time. When younger film fans talk about directors from decades upon decades ago, they're more likely to bring up Billy Wilder, or Akira Kurosawa, or Fritz Lang, or even Ingmar Bergman. I would have to share that sentiment, in a way, because I think all of those (and others) have made films that are just more exciting by today's standards. No one director from that long ago has a filmography that's aged perfectly, and some things are unavoidable when it comes to potentially offending an audience 70 or 80 years after your film is released. But when it comes to pacing, and excitement, and creating characters that are compelling, I feel like Ford is lacking when compared nowadays to some of his contemporaries.I like a lot of John Ford movies. I liked The Quiet Man. But so far I haven't loved any of them, and yeah, The Quiet Man is another to add to that list of liked and not loved. If we're returning once more to those directors I mentioned before, I love Sunset Boulevard and Some Like It Hot, I love Seven Samurai and Ikiru, I love Metropolis, and I love Fanny & Alexander, to name a few films from what was already a small batch of directors. It's hard to come up with a brief, concrete reason why I don't connect to Ford's filmography quite as strongly, and even harder to come up with a reason why a good deal of people around my age don't seem to love his films either.I guess they can be slow. Just a tiny bit too slow, because I approach most older movies willing to be a little more forgiving when it comes to pacing. But The Quiet Man comes in at about 130 minutes, and has an overall very straightforward story. I don't think the length helped in this case, but again, at least it wasn't stretched to the length of an epic, which I'm sure Ford could have done if he'd wanted, given how much of a big name he was. There is some tremendously pretty scenery to look at- I was taken aback, in all honesty, the first time the Irish landscape was shown in all its glory. The lighting and colours and composition all made it look so crisp and tangible, more-so than just about any other movie I can think of from that time period. It was almost as if they'd taken some HD digital cameras back in time and filmed it that way.The other big problem that holds The Quiet Man back from greatness, besides its pacing, is the love story. I know it's far from the only film to do this, but the way the two main characters instantly fell in love was a bit preposterous. Maybe it was easier to stomach back in the 1950s, but watching it now, you're kind of dying for some sort of explanation. Did they have a past they forgot about? Is there some other force pushing them together? Can they at least have a truly passionate, credible talk between each other regarding why they feel the way they do? Can they cheekily acknowledge just how crazy it is that they were so instantly attracted? John Wayne looks distractingly older than O'Hara too, and so even the idea that they're both just really physically attracted to each other is a little hard to believe. At least that shot of their first kiss is so memorably staged and shot that it ALMOST makes you forget for a moment or two how sudden their feelings are.Anyway, get past that, and you're left with some good stuff. It's funny in parts, it has a unique setting, it's amazingly well shot, there's an extended horse race in the countryside which is a lot of fun (and makes the film feel, momentarily, like an Irish western), and the performances are overall pretty good. Wayne is his usual self and he's fine, but O'Hara really shines, and she has an amazing screen presence. Most of the supporting cast playing a variety of quirky, endearing, but undoubtedly stereotyped Irish-folk are pretty good too.It's worth a watch if you don't mind older films and the slow pacing, simple stories and characters, and potentially problematic values that come with them. The Quiet Man certainly has examples of the last of those, I should mention. I tried not to let the fairly casual jokes about domestic violence affect by view of the movie too much, but I know some people are more offended by poorly aged jokes than I might be, so it's worth pointing that out. I don't think it's quite a stone cold classic, but it's mostly likeable and engaging, as well as one of the better John Ford films I've seen, and overall, there are far worse ways to spend just over two hours.",

            "review_title": "A True Gem",
            "content": "This charming film is not only a feast for the eyes, but quite possibly John Ford and John Wayne's best collaboration.Filmed primarily in the lush green Irish countryside, this Technicolor masterpiece is a symbol of post-World War II Hollywood at its best. It may also have some deeper symbolism \u0096 more on that, later!(CONTAINS SPOILERS)In one of his better performances, John Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an Irish-American, who returns to his childhood (and ancestral) home in a small Irish village. He falls in love with and marries a beautiful, but fiery-tempered redhead, Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), with the aid of town bookie and busybody Michaeleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald), who doubles as the traditional Irish `matchmaker.' The antagonist is Mary Kate's stubborn brother, Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen), who has taken to having his henchmen call him `Squire Danaher.'The story is a familiar one: After winning Mary Kate's hand, the Americanized Thornton fails to understand the importance of his bride's dowry, which her brother refuses to give. A former heavyweight boxing contender, he had left the ring in horror after accidentally killing an opponent. He had vowed never to  fight anyone again. Because of this vow, he allows the arrogant Will to taunt and bully him, not realizing that his bride is being equally humiliated. Finally realizing the situation, Thornton rides to the train station, reclaims his wife and drags her unceremoniously (through actual sheep dung, we are told in Leonard Maltin's trailer about the making of the film) back to her brothers' farm, to demand the money. Sean and Will square off in a rowdy fist fight that has the entire town watching and placing bets.The Quiet Man is an absolute joy to watch. Of course the Technicolor brilliance, under the hands of the master Ford and his Technicolor wizard Winton C. Hoch, captures the brilliance of the Irish countryside and O'Hara's untamed red-headed sex-appeal. The accents themselves add to the charm. One finds oneself thinking with an Irish brogue for hours afterward.Yet the real beauty of The Quiet Man is its combination of innocence and sex-appeal-or perhaps that should be phrased `innocence and romantic tension.' While the film's genteel innocence today makes it seem a bit precocious, we must remember that it was pushing the envelope just a tad for 1952. Ohio viewers, in fact, didn't get to see the brief but classic scene of Flynn shaking his head and muttering as he notices the broken wedding bed \u0096 not knowing, of course, that it was broken by Sean angrily flinging Mary Kate onto it, rather than by the means he no doubt imagined. The bed, in fact, came into play more than once. When the huge bed was being delivered, Mary Kate and one of her younger brothers looked on. The brother remarked `Is that a bed or a fairground?' then added to his sisters' embarrassment, `A man would have to be quite a sprinter to catch his wife in that bed!'Wayne and O'Hara have wonderful chemistry. One of Wayne's children remarked (in the Maltin trailer) that his father was an actor who came off the screen, larger than life, and that O'Hara was one actress who could match him. Tough, hot-tempered and determined, yet inwardly fragile, she captures the complex Mary Kate as she battles warring emotions and tries to break through the cultural wall that threatens to permanently mar the new marriage. She also shows some real athleticism in the film.The writing and the cast are outstanding. Fitzgerald was already probably the best known Irish-American actor and he definitely delivers again as the busybody drunk, Flynn. His tipsy attempts to retain the dignity and decorum of the matchmaker while interceeding with Mary Kate, on Sean's behalf, is endearing.McLaglen, meanwhile, is the perfect spoil. A big, loud, rude, well-to-do farmer, he has had his own way in the small village too long to stand by and watch Sean Thornton march in and buy his ancestral home from the neighboring Widow Tillane (Mildred Natwick). The fight scene is a classic.The various townspeople and saloon patrons give the picture a very authentic Irish feel. So do the two clergymen, Father Peter Longergan (Ward Bond), who doubles as the narrator, and the Protestant vicar, Reverend Playfair (Arthur Shields) and his devoted wife (Eileen Crowe). The Catholic priests' leadership in organizing a cheering crowd for the vicar, while his superior (whom he fears may transfer him) is visiting is a charming touch.At least I considered it merely a charming end to the film until a thought hit me. This WAS Ireland! This brings home another big question \u0096 was Ford, whose blood went back to the Emerald Aisle, making any political/religious statements in the film? Throughout the story, the home rule crowd is depicted by Flynn and his younger saloon friends, as good-hearted drunks who provide neither danger to the crown, nor hope to its foes. Later, the Irish Republican Army is even mentioned, and even then, in somewhat good humor.Perhaps the ending gives a clue, though. Father Longergan not only leads the cheering for his Protestant rival, but momentarily hides his collar as the vicar and his superior ride past. Perhaps Ford, indeed, is suggesting that Ireland could be at peace \u0096 or at least, that the political strife could be separated from religious differences, if all parties would swallow their pride (cover their collar) and lend a hand to those on the other side. Of course, this may be reading too much into Ford's work.Political meaning or not, The Quiet Man is one for the ages. This is probably my favorite John Wayne film and one of my all-time favorites. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",

The American tries to convince his new bride that the dowry is unimportant, but she is adamant as a matter of principle. Either he must fight his brother-in-law, or face contempt from both the townspeople and his wife.Yet there is one problem-the American turns out to be a former boxer who accidentally killed an opponent, and who in fact went to Ireland in the first place to leave this past behind him. Now instead of the happy quiet existence he hoped to have, he is forced to consider doing what he hoped never to do again. What to do?

Perhaps, the film could not be made today, because of its downplay of the place women hold in society, but be that as it may, it is a film classic, and meant to be enjoyed on days when one wishes to sit back nd take in the laid-back lifestyle of another land.John Wayne uses a good amount of acting talent to play the role of Sean Thorton, an Irish born native son who went to America, became a professional boxer, and during a bout, killed his opponent in the ring. This cloud hangs over him, he leaves America, and returns to his native town, Innisfree, where he vows to never fight in anger again.In his home town, he meets up with Mary Kate Dannaher, played by Maureen O'Hara. These two had an undeniable screen chemistry, and it certainly came out in this picture. Wayne wishes to marry Mary Kate, but he has riled her brother, Big Will Dannaher, played by Ford stalwart, Victor McLaglen, who refuses to permit such a union. In Ireland, the oldest brother, if there was no father, could take this action.Eventually, thanks to the efforts of the local matchmaker, played by Barry Fitzgerald, and the local priest, played by Ward Bond, Sean and Mary Kate are able to marry, but Will refuses to hand over her dowry, Sean refuses to fight for the dowry, and the Irish landscape begins to boil over.Eventually, matters do come to a head, or fist, between Sean and Dannaher, in a wild, woolly, brawl that starts in an open field on the Dannaher property, goes over the countryside, spills into the nearby town, and in typical Irish manner, ends up in a local pub. The final punches are thrown, and peace ultimately comes to White O'Mornin', the birth home of Sean.If one wishes to enjoy a film dedicated to the Irish, this classic is it. A good 9/10",

            "content": "Although The Quiet Man has traditionally had a place on the top of John Ford's career, I found it to be second, or maybe even third tier Ford. I've seen more than a dozen that I prefer to it, with only two that are on its low level, none really below (however, I like them all). The story here is uninteresting. John Wayne moves to his homeland of Ireland from the U.S., buys back his family home, and courts a young woman (Maureen O'Hara). Her brother (Victor McLaglen) must approve of the marriage, but he refuses. Later in the film townspeople trick him into giving his siter to Wayne in marriage, which starts a bitter feud. The film is played for romance and comedy, and only moderately succeeds in both sectors. It begins very romantically, but as soon as O'Hara's part expands, she immediately becomes overbearing, annoying, and somewhat psychotic. I sure as hell wouldn't want anything to do with that woman. And John Wayne does little with his character. The role is underwritten, with a particularly flimsy backstory. Wayne is generally a very good actor in Ford's films, but he has little to do and, more or less, just stumbles through the entire film. He actually gets pretty mean to O'Hara late in the film, but I disliked her character so much that I almost approved of the scene where Wayne drags her over the landscape on her butt.The supporting cast has better luck. Barry Fitzgerald especially shines, and Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen, and many others whose names I didn't catch were good, too.Perhaps the best reason to watch the film is for the beautiful color cinematography. It catches the country of Ireland well. The music is also quite beautiful.Overall, The Quiet Man does have some great scenes, but there's generally little of interest happening. It's rather overlong at 2 hours and 9 minutes. A lot of other Ford films are more worthy, The Grapes of Wrath, My Darling Clementine, The Searchers, The Wagon Master, the list could go on for nearly a mile. The Quiet Man gets a 7/10, which is quite unimpressive for such a beloved film from such a wonderful director.",

            "content": "To say that this film \"promotes wife-beating\" is beyond preposterous. The worst thing John Wayne does to Maureen O'Hara is to give her a largely symbolic and clearly harmless 'boot in the backside' - something which by that point in the film her character has richly earned. This is no more violent nor misogynistic than, say, the opening scene in The Philadelphia Story. Or scenes in many, many other films that show men and women roughhousing with each other, essentially by mutual consent.Furthermore, to see this film as *promoting* violence, against women or anyone else, is to miss it's main point, by a country mile. This is a film about exactly that peculiar cultural norm, in which violence becomes sublimated into traditions of friendship and caring. It's a film that suggests how our violent natures and our violent past are evolving.Even the title should make this obvious. John Wayne's character is so appalled by violence that he's run as far away from it as he can, to what he views as a garden of Eden. But the seeds of violence remain in his nature, and in those around him. What makes the Ireland of this film an Eden indeed is how the culture has turned malicious violence into a formality, a sort of stylized ritual of friendship.One could say that this is a criticism of Ireland, and perhaps an unwarranted one. Of course, it's not. It could not be more obvious that Ford is using a mythic Ireland to make a point about all of human culture in the mid-20th Century. He suggests that perhaps we are violent animals, but that denying our nature isn't the right answer. He suggests that a healthy culture uses tradition to formalize conflict and allow it to play out in a benign and even creative way.Wayne at first fails to understand that this ritualized 'violence' is not the real thing. That it conveys love, not malice. That it's a peculiar but lively tradition, which acts as a conduit for the relationships of both men and women.Whether all this takes place in anything resembling the 'real' Ireland is obviously irrelevant. This Ireland of Ford's fond remembering is as real as Hilton and Capra's Shangri-La. It's a heaven that we all seek. In a way, Ford's Ireland is an answer to Hilton's. Ford asserts that a paradise that depends on humans acting like angels is unrealistic. We need a paradise where we can acknowledge our darker side, and turn it into a positive thing.Does Ford succeed in making that point? That's another question... But I would say that he does, brilliantly. The Quiet Man is a love story, a story of deep friendship - between the two supposed antagonists, Wayne and McLaglen, who are clearly destined to be devoted friends. Moreover, The Quiet Man is a brilliant evocation of every human's personal quest for a separate peace, a place where they can be themselves, only better.The Quiet Man is one of the greatest masterpieces of film, always in my own top five. It's also one of the most enjoyable, uplifting films of all time. If you emerged from it with any other feeling than joy, you brought that feeling in with you, and simply refused to let go of it.",

I stumbled upon this gem during a snowstorm, sitting by the fire, on a Saturday afternoon. Still the best way to watch a movie at home. The film is pretty light-hearted without being too foolish and silly. You get to see the beautiful Irish countryside and a slower pace of life. I want to fish that stream where Father Lonergan was! The film slowly works up to its climax, the confrontation between Squire Danaher and Sean Thorton. The fight scene is pretty tame by today's standards but it was filmed in 1952. May not be everyone's taste, but if you like John Ford films, the Duke, or old movies, it may be worth your time.",

Drinking, singing, and brawling ensue as various romances get straightened out. Directed by John Ford (and including a number of his usual players, such as Ward Bond), the technicolour cinematography is excellent, the score great, and the story entertaining. The style, especially the sentimentality and broad humour, has not aged well, and while Wayne makes a great brawler, he's a bit weak playing a frustrated husband. Maureen O'Hara is good as the fiery red-head but doesn't do much to raise the character beyond clich\u00e9 (the same is true for Barry Fitzgerald's quaint whisky-loving matchmaker/bookmaker). All in all, a great plug for taking a vacation on the Emerald Isle and a fun, lightweight film that needs to be considered in context (because it has elements sure to offend a broad swath of modern sensibilities).",

Yea, I agree he was no Marlon Brando or William Holden and he never shed a tear(that I recall) but he was a real man. He never appeared to be acting, but merely being himself. That was the appeal of him. He never claimed nor acted like he was different from you or me. Not all caught up with being an enigma like James Dean or marlon Brando..just a regular guy who usually played the part of a man called upon to be courageous and brave. Now on to this gem of film! Too many great scenes and lines to write 'em all down! And the Michelinni character..the little guy who drives the buggy and gave JW the lift from the train station..he was a hoot! Irish folklore is among the richest and most interesting in this world. And finally, one can not understate the authentic and angelic beauty of Maureen O'Hara. She radiates such beauty and romance with her eyes alone that todays actresses can take off ALL their clothes and hardly come close to what she could with a mere glance! Simplistic? Today's world much to complex and sophisticated to ever put out a movie like this? I don't think it so much as sophistication as it that our minds have been dulled and polluted with seeing everything that was once held sacred. Kids today know more about sex at 10 y.o. than we did before we were 21! It is sad that a movie like this would not appeal to the youth of today because no one gets naked or there are no cuss words!

I look forward to any movie outing where i see them together, but this movie \"The Quiet Man\" is my favorite!I almost died with laughter when in a VERY romantic and old-fashioned style, Sean aka John Wayne throws the hot-heated, single-minded \" I want me about Sean, and I if I don't have your man at all!\" as she weeps.Tensions build and much plotting in this wonderful little village of Innis free, Ireland, until finally Ms O'Hara hops on a train to leave.Well with tiny town precision the message travels to Sean and he finally loses his temper (there is a subplot of two as to why he didn't) and he Grabs Her directly out of the train with the townspeople following, one precocious old lade applauding him and saying \"Can I get ye a good stick for the lady sir?!\" I almost died laughing, as Maureen was terribly unhappily and Very much was over his shoulder and pinned, kicking a screaming in a rather risqu\u00e9 moment or so for kiddies, as swats, though endearing certainly threatened! limo.This tiny little movie is more than just a slice of life, it is full of life. I adore the movie even when I thought at fist \"The Duke\" as an Irish son coming home to his ancestry was more than a stretch, but He made it work. Maureen O'Hara wins my heart as the best actor/actress in this movie though that is a tough call. The characterization within a real Irish setting are almost fanciful, but nor.I give this movie 5stars out of five!

            "content": "Sean Thornton (John Wayne) returns back to the village where he was born in Ireland after moving across to America when he was young where he forged a career as a boxer. Now retired, he plans on buying back his former family home whilst also falling for fiery Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara). However, Kate's brother Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) doesn't approve of their relationship and makes things rather difficult for the couple. Meanwhile, Thornton is also hiding a dark secret from his past as well...The first hour of The Quiet Man (in my humble opinion) is where the film is at its weakest; not a great deal happens and character development is rather poor. I can possibly see that revealing little about Thornton until right near the end may have worked for some people - perhaps they may have been intrigued by him. However, I myself found it rather tedious and in order to enjoy a film I need to be able to form some kind of emotional investment in the characters or the story and for the first hour or so I was simply unable to do this. It's all just a little bit too quaint, twee and cutesy for my liking. A lot of the songs are pretty bad (with one song being repeated again about 5 minutes after it was originally sung for some reason).Thankfully, it does improve slightly in the second half (when Thornton's dark secret is revealed). It was at this point that I became more involved with the film because I was finally given a better understanding of our protagonist, but I do think that it was a bad move just shoving this reveal on towards the end of the film - it strikes of laziness and I do feel that Thornton should have been given more development and depth earlier in the film which may have made it a more enticing character study. The reveal explains that Thornton killed his opponent during a boxing match which caused him to hang up his gloves for good and he vows never to fight again yet later in the film he contradicts himself and fights Denahar to prove to Mary that he isn't a coward?? To go from Thornton pouring his heart out to a priest about vowing to never fight again only then to start brawling with Denahar seemed a little strange - this is made worse by the fight being totally unnecessary and being given a rather comical spin (both men have water thrown in their faces on several occasions and they even stop for a beer at one point halfway through their fight). It's also made worse by the fact that Thornton seems unfazed by the prospect of knocking seven bells out of Danaher (Thornton has an emotional flashback when he gets knocked to the ground, but for some reasons this never happens on the numerous occasions when he knocks Denahar to the ground??). Despite this final fight being entertaining, narratively it went against pretty much everything that proceeded it.Still it isn't completely irredeemable; the likes of Flynn, McLagen & Fitzgerald all play their parts in making this film as good as they can. Wayne has his usual swagger about him, but he isn't great here and his performance here feels rather artificial - he delivers his lines very slowly and seems to pause for about 5 seconds after delivering about 5 words. There are some funny moments in the film (although Fitzgerald is responsible for most of these).The Quiet Man may have worked better when it was released and was probably heavily reliant on John Wayne's star power, but I found large parts of the film to be uninvolving and despite the second half being quite entertaining it also seemed to give out mixed messages. Average and watchable, but that's about it.",

He's returned to escape the memories of the tragic event which made him quit the ring, and Wayne does it better than ever.  Maureen O'Hara is absolutely perfect in her portrayal of the Irish \"spinster\" sister of the town's squire.  The supporting cast is priceless, and if you never get a chance to see Barry Fitzgerald in any other movie, watch him in this one... he's the epitome of everything you could hope for in a fine Irish character actor, and gets more mileage from one dram of blarney than a regiment of lesser actors.I won't give away the story if you've been unfortunate enough to never see this absolute jewel of a film.

            "content": "This is a classic film by the renowned director John Ford, the man who single-handedly defined the Western genre. It stars some gorgeous photography of picturesque Irish locations in eye-popping color, a notable first in Hollywood history. It also stars John Wayne in an atypical role as a retired American boxer who returns to his ancestral homeland, and comes out of retirement so he can beat up a young local woman and her elderly brother.At first it looks like it's going to be a Hollywood romance spiced with local color. John Ford favorites Victor McLaglen and Ward Bond reprise the broad Irish accents they used throughout Ford's cavalry films, and the other Irish locals spend most of their time in the village pub, singing and fighting in true stereotypical Irish fashion. Maureen O'Hara plays a young woman with a fiery Irish temper who falls for the Duke.But then it gets confusing. O'Hara's character is less feisty and hot-tempered, and more hysterical and psychotic. The romance involves Wayne repeatedly chasing O'Hara, grabbing her, and roughly having his way with her. The climax begins with Wayne dragging her bodily across half the country, and then fighting Victor McLaglen for about an hour and a half.Perhaps this is what passed for romantic comedy in 1952, which just proves that societal progress is a good thing. The casual sexual violence in the film is shocking, confusing, and just plain weird. By about halfway through the film I honestly had no idea why or how the romance between the two leads was still going. On a second viewing, it might become clear that the real relationship we're meant to care about is the brawny homoeroticism shared between Wayne and McLaglen.",

The surprise is that a movie like this was made by Poverty Row's Republic but apparently the majors turned down Ford's pitch flat. The hokey element of the boxer who killed a man in the ring and is reluctant to fight again has also been done to death (ouch) but again we're happy to overlook it - though even as the film was in release James Jones was using the same clich\u00e9 in his best-selling novel From Here To Eternity when the character in question, Robert E Lee Prewit, merely blinded an opponent.

Filmed in lush Technicolor, Ford's compositions are as redoubtable here as they were in How Green Was My Valley, which used a colliery as the point-of-focus in myriad long, deep-focus shots. Wayne is Sean Thornton, an expatriate American with uncertain difficulty in his past. He falls for Maureen O'Hara, and their courtship yields some of the most sensuous moments I've seen on film: Taking refuge from the rain in a graveyard, with their shirts soaked through, their embraces feel tactile and combustible 50 years later. It's a seductive affair that seems to belong as much to the young lovers as to Ford himself, his generous telling and detailing of people and events inviting us to fall in love, fully immersed temporally and spatially. I think more than anything else, this is what Ford seems to desire in his mise-en-scene and preference for long shots that surround his characters in inviting settings. He is a born storyteller, fascinated by the people who compose an ethnography, in their ways of relating to and coping with their chosen lives. The film also contains a satisfying collection of supporting characters who retain defining quirks and specific agencies. It all adds up to a highly idealized tribute to the resiliency and self-sufficiency of the Irish people, who live in pastoral bliss, where jails are obsolete because all grievances can be worked out with a good donnybrook. Its resonant message, that fighting for what one desires or believes in can redeem even the most hopeless of cases, is direct, sound, and refreshingly rewarding of virtuous intentions.",

Strong willed and set on having what is hers at the expense of anything else. Her brother harsh and strong willed giving Maureen a bad time, tempers flare and there begins huge fights between sister and brother. Along comes Sean Thorton a prizefighter from America. Played by John Wayne, come home to buy the cottage where he was born and retire. Barry Fitzgerald the town matchmaker. Delightful,sometimes funny, excitement, great fight scenes, as John Wayne goes after a beauty Maureen O'Hara. Colorful scenery and country shots filmed in techicolor, even a horse race. Maureen and John give the movie romance that one won't forget. I liked this film. Seeing them fall in love, but also see the strength in the character that John Wayne displayed to hold on to Maureen a very strong willed girl. At times you will find yourself laughing as the tempers flare and none willing to give up their position for the other. Enjoy this Irish tale. It is wonderfully entertaining",

            "content": "When he wasn't riding through Monument Valley, in a shootout with desperados, or involved in fisticuffs in a Western movie, John Wayne was known to have acted in an occasional film of another genre. He made some very good adventure and action films -- \"Hellfighters\" of 1968, \"Harari\" of 1962, and \"Blood Alley\" of 1955. He was in some memorable war films - \"Back to Bataan\" of 1945, \"The Longest Day\" of 1962, and \"Cast a Giant Shadow\" of 1966. And he could act very well in comedies and romances -- \"Without Reservations\" of 1946, \"North to Alaska\" of 1960, and \"Donovan 's Reef\" of 1963.\"\"The Quiet Man\" is one of Wayne's best non-Westerns. It's a very good comedy romance and drama, with an excellent plot and superb screenplay. And, what's really interesting about the making of this film is that John Ford directs it and it includes some others of the unoxfficial \"stock\" and frequent cast members from Ford's Westerns. So, Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen and Maureen O'Hara all have co-starring roles. Toss in Barry Fitzgerald, and the touches of comedy are polished off nicely.Few people know why American Sean Thornton has moved to the small Irish town to buy and live in the home where he was born. And, when John Wayne's Thornton spots Maureen O'Hara's Mary Kate Danaher herding sheep, he feels a new lease on life. But he may have trouble courting her when he acquires his property. Mary Kate's brother, Squire Will Danaher, had been after that property for a long time. McLaglen's Danaher may forever prevent Sean and Mary Kate being united. Ah, but marriage may still be possible due to the interest and efforts of Bond's Father Peter Lonergan and the town's senior match-maker, Fitzgerald's Michaeleenn Flynn.The Quiet Man was a highly popular film in 1952. If finished the year in 10th place at the box office and won two Oscars with five more nominations, including Best Picture. It's probably the best film that the lesser studio, Republic, made in its 33 years from 1935-1967.This is a most enjoyable film with a plot and setting that is timeless. Audiences of all ages should be able to enjoy it yet well into the future. Here are some favorite lines from the film.Sean Thornton, on first seeing Mary Kate Danaher in the distance, \"Hey, is that real? She couldn't be.\" Michaleen Flynn, \"Ah, nonsense, man. It's only a mirage brought on by your terrible thirst.\"Squire \"Red\" Will Danaher, \"He'll regret it to his dying day, if ever he lives that long.\"Michaleen Flynn, \"Heh, heh. You're a well-propertied woman. I wouldn't mind marrying ye myself.\"Michaleen Flynn, \"Easy now! Easy now! This is a courtin', not a donnybrook. Have the good manners not to hit the man 'til he's your husband, and until he can hit you back.\"",

Reading today about how Ford obsessed over her it seems he may have been trying to abuse her on screen in a way he couldn't off screen.\nA lot of the scenes just do not make much sense and the more this story goes on the more one gets the feeling that Ford was a little punch drunk making this. When reading about this today we have been told by ohara that Ford was quite a bad drunk during the filming which makes a lot of sense. Another smaller problem is that for a story like this the female lead should probably be about 10 years younger. Wayne is 45 here but he is passable because he was always in such good shape.\nBarry Fitzgerald is the real star here. Victor mclaglen is also solid but unfortunately he is made to be way too one dimensional and that is one of the greatest faults of the film. Keep your eye out for an assortment of great silent film actors who show up here.\nSome modern viewers may consider this a chauvinistic film even if it is set in an earlier time (late 1890s it feels like).\nCan't overemphasize how great some of the shots are.",

            "review_title": "Awful",
            "content": "This godawful movie should have been named \"Phony Macho Man Kicks Butt.\"Let me note first that Wayne smokes constantly, which isn't anywhere near the worst thing about the movie, but it sure dates it. Plus every time he lit up I was reminded that he died of lung cancer.What was truly awful was the way Wayne's character abused his woman, and how this was portrayed as the way a real man teaches his woman how to behave. He french kissed her before they were even introduced. He kicked her in the butt, he dragged her against her will for five miles to her brother so he could demand her dowry. (That's called kidnapping, by the way, and is a felony in every jurisdiction I'm familiar with.) He forced her to jump over boxes, he refused to stop when she lost her shoe, he kept going after she fell, dragging her as she lay prone. With a large crowd of villagers cheering him on, by the way, since she obviously deserved to be treated like a rag doll. One of the villagers retrieved her shoe and after a long chase finally caught up with Wayne and his captive. The result of this abuse? She now stood by her man, suitably chastened, lesson learned.Then there was the \"fight\" between Wayne's character and his brother-in-law. I lost count of the times Wayne's character (a former professional boxer) was sucker punched by the brother-in-law while he wasn't paying attention. The fight proceeded for several miles (OK, that's a slight exaggeration), with all the villagers following. At some point, the fight developed into a melee in which everyone fought everyone. Until Wayne's buddy fired a pistol twice, which immediately calmed everyone down except for our two original protagonists, giving the brother-in-law one more chance to sucker punch Wayne. Even the priests and the cops cheered them on as they fought.And then Wayne's character and his bro-in-law became good friends, and macho man and his now obedient wife were able to finally consummate their marriage and live happily ever after.Compounding Wayne's offensive \"macho man\" persona is the fact that he was a draft dodger in WWII, staying home to make money instead of trying to contribute to the war effort as virtually all of his contemporaries did. It was not for nothing that.he was booed off the stage by wounded Marines at a naval hospital in Hawaii. Marine veteran William Manchester was there. He described what happened when Wayne made his appearance: \"He was greeted by a stony silence. Then somebody booed. Suddenly everyone was booing. This man was a symbol of the fake machismo we had come to hate, and we weren't going to listen to him. He tried and tried to make himself heard, but we drowned him out, and eventually he quit and left.\"",

            "content": "John Ford swooped his historically fourth BEST DIRECTOR win for THE QUIET MAN in the Oscars, a record very much likely will never be matched, to say nothing of being surpassed. But it was his only win from a Ford-Wayne picture, THE SEARCHERS (1956) was wholesomely snubbed, but it is not a conventional Ford-Wayne picture either, its locale is deviant from their usual Western landscape.Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an Irish-born American from Pittsburgh, returns to his homeland, a backwater town called Inisfree (a fictional place) in the 1920s, he reclaims his family land from widow Sarah Tillane (Natwick) and falls for an ardent ginger Mary-Kate Danaher (O'Hara), after locking horns with her eldest brother Squire Will Danaher (McLaglen), a loutish heavy who also sets his eyes on Thornton's farm, and according to the provincial tradition, Mary-Kate cannot marry without Squire's consent.With a little conspiracy from Sean's new local friends - yes, Sean is the new apple of the eye for this jerkwater town, who can easily gain trust and favour from denizens over the unwelcome Squire himself. - including the matchmaker Michaeleen Flynn (Fitzgerald), reverend Cyril Playfair's (Shields) and his wife (Crowe), who fabricate a quid pro quo to inveigle Squire to marry Mary-Kate to Sean, so himself in return could marry Ms. Tillane, and the plan works (for the first half), Sean and Mary-Kate ties the knot, but an unknowing Ms. Tillane refuses to take Squire for the team, after a bout of ruckus, Squire holds back Mary-Kate's dowry, which according to Sean's noble confession, doesn't mean anything to him, what he loves is her, not her fortune, but talking about different values, for Mary-Kate, her dowry is not just money, it is her own reputation at stake, that's something worth her husband to fight for, but Sean seems to be unmotivated.Sean's past in USA has been carefully veiled in the narrative, only his burly figure and the occasional attention from reverend Playfair, who is a fervent sport fan, knowingly suggest his vocation, a former prizefighter, who has sworn to abnegate boxing after accidentally knocking off an opponent during a match. Now, coerced by an obdurate Mary-Kate, Sean has to use his fists to earn back her respect and prove that he is not a coward, even though in his mind, it is plumb purposeless, but the point is, that's what husbands must do to defend his womenfolk, so a long- delayed close-range brawl between Sean and Squire arrives ebulliently with on-lookers betting their money on who is the last man standing.THE QUIET MAN adheres to the conventional criteria of a patriarchal society under the microcosm of Inisfree, machismo reeks of booze, smoke, gambles and sweat after a fist fight, even Mary-Kate, a perfect specimen of a fine lady, blindly hamstrings her pride in the shibboleth, which leaves the picture a smack outmoded in the eyes of a new viewer six decades later.Visually expansive, thanks to the sublime topography of the Irish countryside (in the sunny days only) and John Ford's discerning sense of aesthetics, THE QUIET MAN also elicits a more layered performance from John Wayne, not merely a macho bigot bogged in his own intransigence, he can also be a rose-loving, violence-relinquishing pacifist, paired with a strikingly zealous Ms. O'Hara, who is so ambidextrous both indoor and outdoor, whether she is playing harpsichord or playing rough against Wayne. Slas, Wayne finds his match, a virtuous leading lady who can both physically and characteristically challenge him in a Ford picture.Victor McLaglen, who is visibly too old to play big brother of O'Hara (34 years of her senior), is the only member in the cast rewarded with an Oscar nomination, but in retrospect, he chews the scenery a bit little. Yet, it is Barry Fitzgerald who almost single-handedly holds intact the film's comedic vibe as the booze-dependent Flynn, with gusto and impeccable foibles, and in truth, THE QUIET MAN aims to be a bubbly ethnographic study sending a more liberal message - there is no reason why Catholicism and Protestantism cannot co-exist harmoniously under the same roof, maybe not all roads can lead to Rome, but at least there are several of them can. A final nod to Victor Young's majestic score, utterly pertinent to accompany a jolly journey in that bygone era and faraway place.",

It also features throughout a thoroughly chauvinistic and subservient treatment of women that you wouldn't see today and still it effortlessly wins me over.It does so with its enchanting depiction of the Irish countryside, a vivacious soundtrack which seems of itself to drive the film along and a cast who, to a man and woman, commit themselves completely to the story and their characters and seem to have great fun in so doing. Once you park all that outmoded \"Woman, where's me tea?\" caveman-like nonsense and surrender to the wonderful flow of the picture, it's obvious that the movie is made with tender love and care. Ford had wanted to make this film for years and considered it his favourite and it shows in every frame and while some of the director's cliched characterisation and bawdy humour might occasionally make you wince, its big heart will win you over.The big lunk Wayne carries the action with his familiar swagger and not unexpectedly in a Ford movie finds himself surrounded by familiar faces hamming it up in the old country, like Victor McLagen as the flinty Danaher, Barry Fitzgerald as the leprechaun-like Flynn and Ward Bond as the fight-loving reverend father while O'Sullivan is terrific as the bartered and after Thornton fetches her from the station, battered bride.With its mix of sly risqu\u00e9 humour and broader comedy and despite being politically incorrect throughout, \"The Quiet Man\" is a knockout pretty much from the first bell to the last.To be sure...",

Now this sounds crazy, after all the movies I have seen, I never thought of it, but I never saw a movie with John Wayne. One of the most famous icons of our time, how could I not know at least one of his films? Now despite the fact that it may not be a \"John Wayne\" film, no western action, Irish in fact, but I didn't mind. While I would agree that this movie is a classic in itself, I didn't really get into it. It was pretty clich\u00e9d, but I think this was the film that made clich\u00e9s before there was any type of movie clich\u00e9, so that's not my complaint. The story just really didn't get to me like I thought it would.Sean moves to his home land of Ireland from America, he has a life he would like to settle down too. His eyes are captured by a young but fiesty Mary Kate who becomes betrothed to him, but her brother Will won't have of it since he has a bad feeling of Sean's past and presence. Mary Kate grows to love Sean, but loves her brother and wants his blessing with their marriage, but Will is definitely going to give them a hard time before he does that.It has action and romance, not to mention a great and strong cast that worked very well together. I would recommend this film for any classic film lovers, it's one to check out. It just didn't keep my interest, but I would never deny in a million years that it was a good movie. John Wayne is a terrific actor and really kept the film going with Maureen, they had good chemistry, loved how they had their first kissing scene with the dramatic wind, always a crowd pleaser.7/10",

This fell short of Rowdy Roddy Piper and Keith David in They LIve, but it was humorous - still not bad for 1952. I was wondering why I missed this film - but then I was only 4 years old & my parents would not have let me see such violence - well, actually they would have.I guess my enduring thought as I watched this classic was: What would Quentin have done with this picture?

            "content": "What starts out as being mildly interesting, amusing and entertaining spirals into a bizarre story of wife abuse and abuse of women in general. This movie is an insult to all women and it has absolutely no other purpose. Unlike GWTW, which actually shows a woman, despite the limitations of the day, strongly pursuing her goals, whether they be food, money or men, \"The Quiet Man\" reveals Maureen O'Hara (\"Mary Kate\"), certainly one of the most beautiful women of her generation, as someone who has no future unless a man marries her. She is a slave to her obnoxious older brother \"Red\" (Victor McLaglen), but once John Wayne (\"Sean\") looks at her, she belongs to him and him only.The problem is, though, Mary Kate has a temper (gee, I wonder why, since her entire life is lived in service of obnoxious men who never once acknowledge her breathtaking beauty -- okay, Sean says she looks pretty one time; wow, good on him, that must have been a real stretch) or her skills as a pianist or her beautiful singing voice. She is a cook, a maid, a sister and/or a wife; she can be nothing else. So, no wonder she is angry and has a temper. And of course, because she has a temper, she must be harnessed, and beaten and controlled. It's horrific.In what realm of the imagination could anyone call this a \"masterpiece\"???This horrid, horrid film tells us (literally spells it out in newsprint, underlined, in case we're too thick to get it) that Sean, a \"Yank,\" accidentally killed a man in a boxing match in America, but because his parents were Irish, he has come home to claim the house they grew up in. How he makes money, how he intends to make money, is never explained. But when he meets Mary Kate (and decides within nanoseconds that he's going to make her his own), she actually has money of her own, her dowry. But Sean doesn't want it; money is problematic (why? Inexplicable, since we don't know where he's getting his). So, a good portion of the film is about how Mary Kate, even though she marries Sean, refuses to be his wife (meaning sleep with him) unless she can have her dowry, which Red refuses to let go of. (This however does not stop Sean from cruelly and viciously throwing Mary Kate into the wedding bed so hard that she falls off it and the bed breaks.)This \"problem\" leads to an endless, insane, poorly choreographed, laughable, pathetic \"fight sequence\" between Red and Sean, which involves the entire town, who swarm around Red and Sean like rabid fans.This \"fight sequence\" also involves Sean having to track down Mary Kate, who has decided that she \"loves him too much,\" and so must leave him. Once Sean finds her, he forces her back to Red's house (this is the most horrible part; he drags her, kicks her, pulls her, shoves her -- all accompanied by cutesy \"Irish\" music), then, once he gets to Red's house, \"delivers\" her back to Red by hurling her at Red's feet.Then there is further insanity about Mary Kate's dowery, which Red finally gives to Sean (it's all coins) by throwing it at him and Mary Kate. Mary Kate attempts to gather her dowry (which has taken her a lifetime to attain), but Sean won't have any of it, and takes all of it and tosses it in to a burning stove. This is how he \"conquers\" her and \"wins\" her back -- after which the fight sequence proper begins and we are treated to what seems like an hour-long sequence of utter madness, all accompanied by toe-tapping, back-clapping \"Irish\" music.At the end of the film, everyone is where they are supposed to be, and they all stand, frozen, as if posing for a Daguerrotype, as the camera pans across their faces, and we finish our little \"play\" in the Irish country side.It is horrid, horrible, unwatchable, unbearable, insulting, degrading, and unforgivable. Yes, there is some pretty Irish countryside, but no matter how much beauty we are treated to, it's clear that John Wayne can't act, Maureen O'Hara was treated like garbage and apparently didn't know that she had a voice and could speak up for herself, that Barry Fitzgerald's tragically alcoholic second banana wasn't funny for one second, and that women were not only second class citizens -- they had less rights than farm animals.I do not know how this could have garnered any Oscars, but other than being used in a university course entitled, \"How Hollywood abused its female stars\" or \"Toxic Masculinity and the studio system that supported it\" -- I do not see any remote cultural value in this movie.Left a bad taste in my mouth and really made me feel bad for Maureen O'Hara, who clearly had talent and world class beauty and deserved so, so, so much better.",

Given that connection, it is odd that I never saw John Ford's The Quiet Man until this week, perhaps because I thought John Wayne was a wooden and unconvincing actor and did not think that the film would bring me any closer to the Ireland of my dreams.Based on Frank Nugent's adaptation of Maurice Walsh's Saturday Evening Post 1933 short story Green Rushes, The Quiet Man was produced by Republic Pictures, not a major studio at the time but the only one willing to take a chance on a film about the Irish. They were well rewarded with a film that won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography as well as four other nominations. Wayne plays Sean Thornton, a boxer from Pittsburgh who gave up the ring after he accidentally killed a man in a fight. The ex-prize fighter returns to Innisfree to buy the Irish cottage in which he was born and sets his eyes on Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), a redhead with an infamous temper.Mary Kate's older brother, 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLagen), a town bully refuses to consent to his sister's marriage and it is left to alcoholic Matchmaker Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) and the local pastor Father Lonergan (Ward Bond) to trick Danaher into changing his mind. When brother Will realizes he's been tricked, however, he refuses to pay the dowry that includes family treasures, furniture, and 350 gold coins and Mary Kate refuses to consummate the marriage. This leads to an inevitable confrontation with Thornton and a barroom brawl that clocks in at nine minutes.Though partly filmed in Ireland with scenery that is verdant and beautiful, The Quiet Man has an artificial quality to it that all the Barry Fitzgerald colloquialisms do not change. Though it was a personal favorite of Ford and is all in good fun, it is an overly romanticized film complete with Hollywood stars, quaint Irish brogues, horses and carts, and balladeers ready to burst into song at every tavern. The brogues, however, are not the only quaint items in the film. There is also the macho attitude that makes it imperative that a man has to physically confront a bully regardless of the odds.It also brings the audience to applause as they watch a man drag and kick his wife five miles by her hair, then receive a stick by a villager with which to \"beat yer lovely wife with\". I realize the scene is played for laughs and maybe Mary Kate deserved such treatment for her materialistic obsessions, but it still resonates poorly with this twenty-first century viewer. I think those with a strong feeling for Ireland would be better off avoiding the blarney of The Quiet Man and reading James Joyce, William Butler Yeats, or simply listening to the exquisite Danny Boy, a song that never fails to bring tears to my eyes.",

I have to say that I found it really dated and offensive towards women. It's not only the fact that violence generally and specifically against women is glorified. I just couldn't stand the fact that the woman was expecting her husband to be violent against her. She doesn't respect him and thinks he's a coward until he finally gets all macho and treats her really rough, which is greeted by applause and cheers from the whole village. My friend argued that this was just how things were those days, but I think it's one thing to show how things are in society, and another to take a quite dubious custom and transform it into supposedly light entertainment. Although this was my main complaint about the movie, there were other aspects I didn't like: This seems to be more an American fantasy of idyllic Ireland than a remotely realistic portrait, and most of the actors do not even have an Irish accent, as far as I can judge. John Wayne's acting is quite bad, and the film is much too long for my taste. I liked the beautiful landscape though, and Maureen O'Hara is absolutely stunning.

Never been a big John Wayne fan, but I DID enjoy this film. I was slow to warm to it at first but after the first half hour found myself smiling and laughing at some of the action and dialogue. Maureen O'Hara was a delight and beautiful as always, and John's character was more than one-dimensional, a problem that I find in many of his other films. Perhaps the passion he held for the film project contributed to his fine performance as the American who comes to Ireland to escape his tragic boxing past. I enjoyed all the side characters too and found it pretty realistic of small town life in Ireland, not stereotypical at all. One thing I would like to mention is that I enjoyed the musical soundtrack and the Irish folk songs I heard in the film. I wish someone who knows more about this type of music than I do would list the titles on the IMD someday. I definitely recommend this charming film classic.",

It's not a romance, it's a fight and while I can see that it was probably done that way to appeal to both the female and male audiences (Predominantly John Wayne fans I would imagine), it hasn't really aged well, especially watching it in a time when everyone is fighting for their rights. It makes things like dowry's and asking permissions seem very inappropriate and outdated.The general script is amusing, especially those lines spoken by Barry Fitzgerald as Michaeleen Flynn, although it doesn't show the Irish population as a very forward thinking people and instead represents them all as heejits who solve things with liquor and their fists.And in the end that is the solution to all of Sean's problems. Treat 'em mean to keep 'em keen! Although he was a bit too rough to my mind. I'm not sure that's what women really want either, but Maureen O'Hara as Kate seems to respect the ex boxer all the more for it.And although the film is a lot of fuss and drama for no real reason that I can see, it is fairly cute.Who can tame the wild and fiery Mary Kate Danaher? Only one man of course, the one who has won all of the wars and defeated all of the villains in the Wild West, John Wayne as Sean Thornton.The sets are a bit dodgy at times and it seems that even Mr Wayne complained about that when the film was made, but other than that it's an enjoyable watch that doesn't require too much thought. Not essentially the type of film that I would normally rush to watch, but I wouldn't be upset if someone asked me to watch it with them.

There's green everywhere as he proudly displays the Irish countryside.The story revolves around Sean Thornton (John Wayne) an ex patriot who has been raised in the USA and returns to his homeland following a tragic occurence in the boxing ring. He is met at the train station by the Michaeleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald), which is not explained. He offers to take Thornton to his destination. Along the way, they stop briefly and Thornton catches sight of a beautiful redhead named Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara). Love at first sight? You bet.Thornton learns that his family's old cottage is now owned by the rich widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick). He goes to her home to buy back his ancestral home. Squire \"Red\" Will Danaher (Victor McLaglan) and Mary Kate's brother is also there to bid on the property. Danaher has his eye on the widow but she chooses to sell to Thornton which enrages the burly man who takes an immediate dislike to him.Thornton takes possession of the cottage and finds Mate Kate within having been tidying up the place. He grabs hold of her and kisses her only to get that patented O'Hara slap across the face. Thornton decides to go courting but is first faced with the local custom of employing a marriage arranger (Flynn) to keep the parties discretely apart until the wedding. Brother Will fiercely opposes the union.After spending the night at a graveyard during a rain storm, Danaher reluctantly agrees to the wedding but refuses to release Mary Kate's dowry. To Mary Kate, the marriage cannot be consummated until she receives her dowry. In a memorable scene, Thornton breaks down the bedroom door when Mary Kate locks him out and throws her roughly onto the bed breaking it. When Flynn arrives the next morning he thinks that the couple had spent a memorable wedding night. Not so.This arrangement goes on even when Mary Kate gets her furniture from her brother. But Will has withheld the money portion of the dowry. Thornton becomes increasingly frustrated. When Mary Kate in a feeling of guilt leaves to flee to Dublin, Thornton in a rage, goes after her and drags her back to her brother. Up to now, Thornton had been reluctant to fight Danaher due to his past but this time no punches are pulled and......................................................John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara had a marvelous chemistry on screen. It is quite apparent that they really liked each other (professionally of course). This film turned out to be somewhat of a family affair. John Ford employed his brother Francis in the role of the bearded Dan Tobin and his som Patrick worked behind the scenes. Maureen O'Hara's two brothers, Charles Fitzsimmons and James O'Hara had roles in the picture and Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields (who plays the protestant minister) were brothers and John Wayne's four children Michael, Melinda, Patrick and Toni also appear. Ken Curtis appears unbilled as the accordian playing Dermot Fahy.There were a couple of instances of sexual tension displayed in the picture. Ford had to be careful with the censors as this was only 1951. There's plenty of so-called Fordian humor to go around as well. Barry Fitzgerald and Victor McLaglan steal the film in my opinion. Ford, O'Hara and Wayne cited this as their favorite film. It's no coincidence that neither Ford nor Wayne ever worked at Republic Pictures again. They jusy didn't like studio boss Herbert J. Yates constant cost cutting and interferance.Not for everyone, it is nonetheless a classic of its day.",

Just so you know the boundaries.I think the chemistry between Wayne and O'Hara is magical. I'll agree that Wayne isn't the great speech maker, but like so many have said, it wasn't his style. I would encourage you to look at the scene where Wayne and O'Hara are trying to find cover from the rain. It looks like they found it, but they just stand there in the rain. What's great about this scene is the whole pace of the movie slows almost to a stop at this point (magnificent direction by John Ford), and O'Hara follows Wayne's lead. It is Wayne who begins to relax first in her physical comfort and then O'Hara follows and turns her head on Wayne's chest. One of the best love scenes I've ever seen played (better without a kiss).You've got to love Barry Fitzgerald, \"There'll be no playin paddy fingers in the Holy water...\" What a hoot! Maureen O'Hara at her best, and I feel the most vulnerable of all her roles (though some may argue her first with Laughton). I don't think we would have perceived Kate Danaher as vulnerable if it would not have been Wayne playing Sean. Just my opinion. O'Hara always seemed to be playing a losing hand to Wayne even when she was holding out for the dowery. Although a great acting job by Ms. O'Hara did give us some doubts as well they should.Moral of the story: Get Angry, Fight, Make Up, Kiss and drink plenty of Liquid Refreshments.",

            "content": "This is one of the most delightful and effortlessly entertaining film romances. It also might be the ultimate John Ford film, bringing together almost everything that made his films his own in one package. There's Ireland, male bonding, horse racing, and John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, along with most of his regular supporting cast like Ward Bond and Victor McLaglen. The production was apparently very hard on Ford, to the point where he was bedridden for several days during which Wayne directed some of the horse racing sequence, but the end result is just so completely charming that it's hard to imagine that there could have been that much turmoil involved in the making.Sean Thorton (Wayne) arrives in the small Irish town of Inisfree from America with the aim of purchasing the house in which he was born. His parents moved him to Pittsburg when he was a small child, and the house is owned by the Widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick). Guided by the local Michaeleen (Barry Fitzgerald), who seems to have no life other than tagging along with Sean, the new arrival appears at the widow's house with cash ready to offer her for the property. The problem is that the Squire Will Danaher (McLaglen) has wanted the land for some time as well, but the widow decides to offer up the land to Sean pretty much to exclusively annoy Danaher. Danaher ends up hating Sean from the start, which wouldn't be a huge issue if Sean wasn't completely smitten with Danaher's spinster, redheaded, and hot-headed sister Mary Kate (O'Hara).Mary Kate has long since given up on marrying (having turned away more than her fair share, convinced they were only after her money), but when the handsome, tall, and somewhat brash American shows up and shows affection for her, she can't do much but fall for him at the same time. The problem ends up being that the custom in Ireland is that, barring a father, a sister must receive permission to marry from her eldest brother, Will.Watching The Quiet Man for the first time in a while, I kept thinking of two other Ford films that I don't like very, Tobacco Road and How Green Was My Valley. The former was a broad comedy that relied heavily on Southern American stereotypes, and the latter was anchored by an opening that made life in the small Welsh mining town seem so saccharinely perfect. The Quiet Man relies on broad Irish stereotypes, and it also builds its story on a heavily idealized version of Ireland. However, I find that the combination ends up working incredibly well in The Quiet Man where it didn't in the earlier films. The stereotypes are gentler and less broad while the picturesque ideal of Ireland is helpfully offset by actual conflict. Yes, Ford's vision of Ireland is too nice, but it's not so nice as to preclude any actual drama from the start. Sean is viewed as an outsider, though he's welcomed, but most importantly, Will acts as an actual dramatic obstacle to overcome from the moment he's introduced.Will doesn't want Sean to have the land, and he doesn't want Sean to have Mary Kate. Something must be done, and Michaeleen concocts a scheme with Father Lonergan (Bond) and a few others to convince Will that the only reason the widow doesn't return his affections is because Will still has an adult woman in the house, his sister. Sean is not in on this plot, but when Sean wins the horse race, snatching up the widow's bonnet instead of Mary Kate's, Will becomes convinced that Sean has given up on Mary Kate and is now pursuing the widow. Confronted with losing what he actually wants because of his obstinance, Will gives in, offering his acceptance of the union along with a three hundred fifty pound dowry. Discovering that it was all a ruse after the wedding, acrimony explodes and Sean refuses the dowry, dragging Mary Kate home in tears.The first half of the film was about Sean finding his place in Inisfree. The second half is about Sean earning it. Mary Kate refuses the marriage bed because she feels like she's unmarried without her dowry and that Sean is a coward for not fighting for the money that's hers. He, on the other hand, has very good reasons for not wanting to get into a fight. He has a secret, having been a successful boxer with a shot at the title who killed a man in the ring, an experience that has turned him away from using his fists for any reason. The two, after their marriage, must find a way to fully belong to each other. That means that Mary Kate needs to learn the importance of the money to the marriage, and Sean needs to learn to fight for whom he loves.This pair of character movements is carried out with the deft humanist touch that Ford had shown so effectively in films like Submarine Patrol and They Were Expendable in a war context. In 1920s Ireland, it's reduced in scale but not effect. What Sean and Mary Kate end up doing with the money when they do get it just fills my heart with happiness. It's the perfect place for them to end up.And then Sean and Will fight, and it's a rollicking fun brawl that goes across the countryside and into the town with a pause at the local pub, all while the whole town, including the visiting Protestant bishop, bets on the winner with Michaeleen trying to keep track.Ford was never exactly in love with color photography. Like Billy Wilder, he largely preferred the artistry of black and white over the use of color, but when Ford used color, he really used it (it still makes me sad that Drums Along the Mohawk's original Technicolor negative is lost). The Quiet Man is marvelously green from beginning to end, visually underlining the idyllic nature of the story. Ford's cinematographer, Winton Hoch, apparently didn't like how green it was turning out, helping to feed Ford's doubts of the production contemporaneously, but I love the results (and so did the Academy that awarded the film Best Color Cinematography, along with Ford's fourth Best Director win).Wayne himself is perfect as Sean. He carries a certain sadness and passion for his past and his wife while pairing with Victor McLaglen well in terms of size and spirit. Maureen O'Hara is wonderful as Mary Kate, spirited and quick-tempered but also able to effectively sell the change in perception she has in terms of her husband's apparent cowardice. The supporting cast are always fun to watch, given amusing business like Ward Bond's Father Lonergan trying to fish while also chastise Mary Kate for her failures as a wife.This probably is the easiest film to love in Ford's large filmography. Bright and colorful while consistently entertaining from beginning to end with delightful performances from the leads on down, The Quiet Man is old school Hollywood filmmaking at its best.",

For goodness sake people, it is a reworking of Shakespeare's _Taming of the Shrew_ that shows how women manipulate patriarchal society. Yes there is patriarchy, but the point is how Maureen O'Hara manipulates John Wayne and her brother. How can you not love the beauty of Ireland, the hotness of Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne as the perfect deadpan Yank? His \"John Wayneness\" is as perfect for representing the quintessential American, as Barry Fitzgerald is as always as THE Irishman.

So many great moments, I love when the man says \"saddle his horse he says!\" and starts humming the music to come in the very next scene... I saw another movie do that not long ago, but can't remember what it is, no matter, then Maureen jumps a little obstacle course on the way back home ;) Or during the fight at the end when the bucket just keeps getting bigger and bigger throughout the course of the fight until they look like they're fighting in a flood. Maureen O'hara truly is the best thing about this movie, her power as an actress was undeniable. John Wayne is more looks than great acting ability. What an extraordinarily brilliant film.",

            "content": "\"Ford's greatest triumph.\" That was the tag-line Republic used in promotion of its new release, a movie that almost didn't get filmed but for a swap John worked with Herb Yates to make two Westerns as box-office insurance (It was the 50s). So after years of seeking a backer, the great director's pet project finally came to fruition and proved the studio's top money-maker. John's Grapes (40) and How-Green (41) are more powerful, The-Searchers (56) more epic and Liberty-Valance (62) more melancholy, but if I had to pick just one from his vast catalog to send up my spirits, it would be The-Quiet-Man.What will impress you early in this tale of an American boxer (Wayne) who's tragedy in the ring has sent him on a journey of self-discovery, back to his native Ireland, is the film's visual delights, for this is a Technicolor tour-de-force in league with Pressberger-Powell's Black-Narcissus & The-Red-Shoes. But that's only after Oscar winner (80-Days) and 24-times nom'd Victor Young's unforgettable music has set your feet to tap and heart to soar as soon as that Republic eagle, production logo appears. The moods they create can be miles apart, a \"good stretch of the (sprockets),\" you might say, but the great opening scores (The-Third-Man) have a common trait: insta-tell. All you need hear again is one bar to know right away, good times are straight ahead!Beautiful and fiery Maureen O'Hara is both John's wife and emotional sparing partner, Victor McLaglen his well-propertied nemesis with \"a tremendous right and jaw of granite,\" Barry Fitzgerald his cabbie, matchmaker & town gossip, Ward Bond his fly-fishing priest who succeeds where politicos have failed (Protestants + Catholics) and Arthur Shields as Rev. Playfair, a former boxer himself turned tiddlywink enthusiast, Bishop's drinking buddy, \"Snuffy\" to his charming wife (Crowe) and confidant to our troubled protagonist who proves the film's sage and Sean's guiding light.You may notice by movie's end that there is more money that ends up on the floors of pubs and wedding parlors in Inisfree than finds its way into the Bank of Ireland. That's hyperbole, for sure, but if the The-Quiet-Man is any indication of life on the island (Irish Gaelic: Sleeping-bag = \"m\u00e1la codlata\"), one could probably eke out a pretty decent living just by gathering specie off the floors of such establishments, that is if 'Red' Danaher had tied the knot with the widow Tillane and together issued sufficient \"spawn\" to populate the green Isle with the Squire's hot-headed habit for sending coins to flight.And if you be wondering what it is exactly that Mary-Kate is whispering to Sean at movie's end, let me just say, an Irishman worth his weight, even one molded in America, won't be giving up his shillelagh as Trooper did, excepting for one thing and one thing only, and it AIN'T the drink, mind you! Planting is what they'll be doing and not rose bushes this time. Now go on and be about your business (4/4)!",

I think of films like \"The informer\" (1935) playing in Ireland or \"How green was my valley\" (1941) playing in Wales and starring Maureen O'Hara.In \"The quiet man\" both sort of films come together. John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara both have a leading role. The film is situated in Ireland but contains themes from the Western genre.More specific the message of the film is that a real man stands up for his rights and is willing to fight if necessary. Someone who tries to keep the peace at all costst is a weakling.Sean Thornton (John Wayne) is not a weakling but nevertheless tries to keep the peace for most of the film. This has something to do with his past as a professional boxer, a story element wich has definite similarities with \"Body and soul\" (1947, Robert Rossen).The film contains some beautiful images of Connemara and the matchmaker Michaleen Oge Flynn (a superb supporting role of Barry Fitzgerald) makes it even more Irish. All prejudices regarding the preferences of the Irish for the pub and singing are confirmed. We have to keep in mind however that John Ford was of Irish descendancy himself. You can't have prejudices againt yourself, can you?",

How times have changed, and not necessarily for the better. I know that modern viewers probably are upset by the sexist treatment of women that goes on in the plot but even in 1952 we were not that bad.

It's amazing that the studio thought it would flop but I think everyone involved with this movie had to know they had something special on their hands.There isn't a weak link in this entire film, the stars are perfectly cast and give flawless performances as do all of the supporting actors, not just Barry Fitzgerald, his brother Arthur shields, Ward Bond and Mildred Natwick there are people with only a line or two who deliver them perfectly. Ken Curtis also adds a lot with his wonderful singing, it's a movie which would be less enjoyable even if just one person were removed.

Certainly not an uncommon theme in literature & film, but the unique way it's told here is subtle and resonated with many.One of the most memorable shots in cinematic history is the punch which triggers the flashback to Sean's boxing match. Splendidly shot and edited, John Ford reveals to us the source of Sean's present fears, all without breaking character perspective. Finally at that point everything clicks: he never wants to enter another fight again, for fear of accidentally killing yet another man. Indeed he is afraid of his own strength.His fear makes complete sense and is something a general audience could understand and sympathize with, even if not empathize (most people have never killed). We don't look down on Sean for this and how it haunts his soul, and yet still ANY fear, even if completely rational and sane-minded, must be overcome to truly transition into becoming a man.The killing is what drove him to return to Ireland in the first place, akin to a boy retreating into his mother's arms (in this case the mother being his motherland/birthplace). Both Miss Danaher and her brother pick up on this, and don't respect him until he proves his mettle by finally fighting again. One might think on the surface that the big fight scene is just two dudes duking it out for the purpose of action, but it is actually the culmination of Sean overcoming his fears and entering manhood. A happy ending to a fairly dark but wonderful tale.",

Duke is at his best in this movie and looks the part of the young boxer he plays with an iron jaw and rugged good looks. Maureen O'Hara, his love interest, is also at her best in this offering. She's a wonderful looking Irish red head who plays the hot tempered sister of local squire and land baron, Will Danaher, very convincingly. Danaher is played by the inimitable Victor McLaglen, a thespian seldom accorded the credit he deserves. Duke's character is Sean Thornton, an Irish American prize fighter who accidentally killed a man in the ring and retired from boxing. He moved to his family's old neighborhood in Ireland to escape the memory of the accident. Eventually he marries Mary Kate Danaher, Maureen O'Hara's character and the two settle into married life. Unfortunately, Squire Danaher does not pay the anticipated dowry to Thornton and, as a result, Mary Kate is absolutely humiliated. Sean chooses to ignore the insult rather than get into a physical battle with Danaher. His wife sees this refusal as cowardice (Sean won't tell anyone of the dead boxer in his past) and does not react in a loving and wifely way to her new spouse. To keep her, Sean approaches Will Danaher and demand payment of the dowry. A fight ensues between Danaher and Thornton and it no doubt qualifies as one of the finest and also longest battle sequences in film history, with the entire town, including resident and visiting clergy attending the spectacle. The film ends on a positive note with Sean, Mary Kate and Danaher having dinner together. John Wayne (The Duke) is an American icon. We won't see his likes again. Looking about, I don't see another actor with the stage presence and body of work to which Duke lays claim. I've watched him from his early work in Stagecoach all the way through to his final movies and believe that he is a uniquely American icon. He had to wait virtually all of the way through a fantastic career before he finally won a long overdue best actor Oscar. I don't think we'll ever get over this man. He represented the very best qualities that we expect of American heroes.",

It is full of impressive scenic shots, amazing colors and exciting scenes. The type of scenes, that make this romantic drama even more exciting. You feel the energy coming off of John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, who is a genuine Irish actress, so she was perfect for this part. The chemistry between Ford and O'Hara matches the complete differences between the two of them.John Wayne is cool in this film and O'Hara is a knock-out. This is a classic story about an American, who arrives in Ireland to claim his inheritance. He just manages to run into the best looking lady in all of Ireland. It is a typical, simple, easy story to digest. I use the term \"typical\" loosely, because the legendary John Ford, with a typical story, creates a world that is not typical and gives us a great look into a 1950s Hollywood drama, centered in Ireland. This film and Ford's work on this movie is the stuff of Hollywood legends. This is a must-see film and a perfect one to watch for St. Patrick's Day.8.0 (B- MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

Ward Bond had become one of my favorite character actors in the cinema. If you haven't see this movie, watch for the scenery and vivid colors in this movie. I have noticed that John Ford is very meticulous when it comes to location for all of his pictures. John Ford also loved to carry the same ensemble cast to various projects (Wayne and Bond).

            "review_title": "Beautiful film, romance is lacking, plot is too thin",
            "content": "It's a movie that's close to perfect in some areas and then less than stellar in other areas. Depending on what you enjoy in movies you may think it's just fine or a great work of cinema.Firstly, the cinematography is exquisite. It's close to perfect really. You will need to watch classics like Lawrenre of Arabia to find anything like this. The movie is made to show off an Irish rural community presented from its best possible side. You see horse riding in nature, a glorious church, cozy cabins, old time bar, old locomotive. There is a lot to look at here in all scenes. It's glorious and a nice watch just for that. Only negative note on this are some sound stage scenes where we see various actors watching some spectacle and it's clear the sky behind them is not real.Second great factor is Maureen O'Hara. She's spectacular as the love interest. She carries a less than stellar plot. As soon as John Wayne spots her and we see her acting like a low IQ fool you are bound to fall in love with her character too and understand his interest. She looks fabulous, but that alone can't keep your interest for a full movie. She acts like some silly girl who has never seen a man be interested in her. She hides around corners and stares at him and refuses to marry him unless her brother says she can. I frankly don't know if people like her exist, but such a silly and cute role in a movie is perfect to keep the engagement high. Spectacular acting. As Wayne tries to follow their weird customs to marry her and we see her acting and the beautiful landscape we are engaged enough no matter the plot being a bit too simple.Now, unfortunately the plot is quite thin for a 2 hour runtime. Even for 1:30 hour the plot would be thin. For 2:09 hours you keep asking yourself where it is going and what the point is. We see Wayne move back to Ireland from USA. Later we learn that he killed a boxer in the ring and wanted to escape the mental anguish. But then apparently he's a millionaire too or something yet we never understand why he is filthy rich. Was he a top boxer? He even burns money at one point. In one scene he throws away his hat. In another he destroys his own door and bed. They overall seem to not much care about property. They spill beer everywhere and in another scene Wayne destroys another door. It feels like a silly cartoon that never cares to explain itself. All the men in town like to shout a lot and look silly which leads to some bad acting. But they are side characters. The plot overall is basically a guy coming to a fun little cozy town and marrying a perfect woman while fighting her brother. That's it. It's very well made and looks great. No scene is boring as such. And you are interested till the end. But there are quite a few scenes and events I didn't get. It feels like either I didn't get the humor, didn't understand their accents, or maybe there is some old costum I didn't understand. Not even sure what it is. The time period is also not clearly defined. I'm looking at it and it could be anywhere from 1910 to 1952. The most advanced technology we see is a locomotive and a phone. Apparently it's the 1920's, go figure.Wayne is a cool character. But I always find him a bit crude. He's never smart about anything in his movies. Stuff just comes to him because he is crude and hits first which is lazy filmmaking, but does look movie cool. I don't like how he throws his wife around. Unfortunately the marriage starts on a bad foot and 50% of the marriage scenes are them fighting. Initially her just spotted her and thought she looked hot and that's that. There is nothing more to it. They actually don't like each other's personalities; she just wants to get away from her brother. So you really feel like this marriage will end in disaster. At any point it looks like he is going to slap her. And since he's a former boxer it feels that way. Of course she wants to be a good wife in front of the village and won't leave him. But it's sad that he cares so little about her feelings here. He's supposed to be Wayne the man's man, but keeping your wife happy is a man's job and he's largely failing at it. Never saying anything positive to her. Not buying her gifts. Not defending her honor. Of course he does all these things in some ways, but never with any care so it looks like a totally loveless relationship because of him. He's cold, quite violent, and uncaring. She is trying her very best and it's way more than he does. I guess not all relationships are the same, but you wonder how she could fall in love with him in just some months when he acts like a jerk. He's not the right man for this romantic role. Luckily most modern actors largely know how to play the romantic lead too. The script could have made him more caring in some way to make up for his style of acting. Because of this I don't think it's a strong romance for teen girls. This is not a \"dreamy\" man. But what do I know? I just wanted to see the relationship work and it didn't. There was no care or romance which is a huge fault. Maureen O'Hara carries the movie on her shoulders, but it's not quite enough.",

It is an exuberantly photographed production with beautiful Irish locations (Innisfree, a well-known geographical name thanks to its locally produced margarine) . Its subliminal motto is the comings and goings of the protagonist couple, who after a certain strangeness have the possibility of conjugal peace. Between modernity and tradition, John Ford's soft, light and Manichean tone is overly sentimental, not unlike his other, more complex and ambiguous reference works such as The searchers (1956) and The Informer (1935). The American protagonist, Sean's definitive acceptance by the local Irish community will only be satisfied when he finally decides to bow to the codes of tradition, acting vigorously with his wife (in a shameless manner by today's ridiculous politically correct standards) and struggling with her brother.

With the on-screen chemistry between Wayne and O'Hara, the farcical comedy of Barry Fitzgerald and the breathtaking landscape on which they are filmed, Ford (who received an Oscar for Best Director for this project) draws you into his world of hard-work, good times and tremendous passion.

            "content": "Why this film is considered a romantic classic is beyond me.  Ohara and Wayne both greatly overact to create a silly and contrived love/hate relationship built mainly on Wayne's brutal treatment of her.  O'hara plays the role of the typical feisty love interest whose attraction to Wayne seems to be based more on a sadistic relationship than anything else.  Throwing her violently on a bed or dragging her by her arm, Wayne is portrayed as a gentle giant of sorts...a gentle giant whose only way of solving problems is through physical force.  A longer-than-necessary brutal fight between two men, passed off as a playful bout,is evidence enough that a better title for this film would be \"The Cave Man\".Aside from the socio-political implications of this film, the storyline was uneven and vastly uninteresting.  Although this film was made at a time when audiences drooled wide-eyed over foreign accents, the intricacy of the Irish brogue and wit is lost to the confining framework of Hollywood dialogue. Character development (aside from Wayne) is week.  The Priest and constant flow of old Irish guys makes for an interchangeable cast and scene list.O'hara's character is so one dimensional that she seems barely human.  Her constant worries concerning the terms of her rushed marriage only add to this.  If this story is supposed to be about love, then why does O'hara seem to put everything before it?  I couldn't help but wonder why exactly Wayne like this woman so much.  Their relationship seemed quite empty and unexplained, as if most of their courtship took place off screen.I found this film trite, boring, meaningless, and regressive in its view of women.",

What strikes me as interesting about The Quiet Man is that it's an art film starring John Wayne (along with several other stars usually seen in popular films). I give most of the credit for pulling this off to Ford's inspired direction. To be able to take the most typecast Western actor and believably turn him into a washed up ex-pat boxer was a major feat.It brings to mind Fernandel, who churned out mediocre comedies at about the same pace as John Wayne churned out westerns. At the time The Quiet Man was being made, Fernandel was chewing up the scenery as Don Camillo the temperamental priest. But he had played key roles in several of Pagnol's classic films in the 30's and 40's, and occasionally played well later on, under directors such as Verneuil and Autant Lara. You wonder whether Wayne could have done a few more top notch films if he had spent more time out of the saddle - roles more like what Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster were playing at the time.",

This pair was to go on and make a number of films together including his other gem \"McClintock.\" Add to the outstanding cast with Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald, Mildred Natwick and Victor Maclaghlan among others and the feature soars.

He had no intention of doing anything but living a peaceful life in the home he was born in.This film was light hearted and comical and dramatic in its own right. I've first taped the film from AMC Channel commercials and all but now I own the DVD. I will never part with it.",

Filmed in County Mayo, Ireland, to be exact, which is the place her father's people came from!This is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever had the pleasure to behold! Maureen O'Hara sparkles like a jewel in Technicolor, John Wayne is handsome, and the whole cast helps bring the film to life.The most remarkable thing about this movie to me, is how gorgeous it is, just on a natural level. No special effects, just a superbly special setting that is the lush Irish countryside, and it makes the movie! The Irish certainly are a blessed bunch to live within such grand beauty- which stands out even more, thanks to the art of Technicolor.Tonally, this film is light- a light romance, comedy, and drama. It isn't a romcom though, it's more a scenic character study, Tempers flare a bit too much for my taste off and on throughout, but overall, this is a soothing, gentle, very simple movie, which I like.Another thing I like about this movie is its twin flame elements. Anyone who knows anything about the concept of twin flames and watches this movie, will probably recognize the mirroring of a twin flame relationship going on, and other twin flame elements, such as it being a relationship between two people who come from different places, and also that what one wanted to stay away from, the other was desperate to have- so this illustrated the exposing each-other's wounds and making you face them element of twin flame relationships. The two main characters mirrored each-other in how significant (in a good or bad way) money was to them, and through that, they were forced to face their own fears and struggles around it.This film is a must-see for any fan of its stars and the Technicolor films of the olden days.",

Height of their career performances by all involved, especially Sullivan, Barry Fitzgerald and John Wayne.  The movie is especially worth watching for fans of Wayne & Ford's Fort Apache movies (She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, etc), since all of these movies have almost the same core cast of the usual John Ford regulars.  All in all, a brilliantly heartfelt film that can be watched at any time of the year, Irish or not.  It's about heart, it's about family and it's about how a man and a woman sometimes just have to stand up for themselves.

That may partially be because this film is not the John Wayne of Westerns or wars. His role in The Quiet Man is like no other role he ever played, and he shines. He did make other comedies (such as the 1963 quasi remake of this film, McLintock), but here he is legend. The story sets up with Sean Thornton coming home to his family's native land holding in Ireland after accidentally killing a man in a boxing match in America. His psyche is clearly bruised as a result, and he has a beautiful homestead to help him recover. Enter O'Hara, and the film morphs into a loose remake of The Taming of the Shrew. Touching and sentimental throughout, the film captures the viewer's attention and never lets go. That's even though we are sure of the eventual outcome. Witty at times, hilarious at others, Sean and Mary Kate capture our hearts along with some of the local characters played to perfection by a superlative cast, including Ward Bond as Father Lonergan, Victor McLaglan as Mary Kate's brother \"Red\" Danaher, and Barry Fitzgerald as Michaleen Flynn. There is some stunning on location filming, but the studio sets are not at all off-putting, because Wayne and O'Hara are the focus no matter where they might be courting or rebelling. I have seen this film more than a dozen times, and when I do decide to watch it, I clear out two hours for uninterrupted pleasure. The writing and dialogue are precise and imaginative, and Ford's direction is at his peak. He was the master of cinema story-telling and oh what a story this one is. The whole experience has never once seemed trite or stale. Just good old fashion entertainment. No one should go through life without seeing this film at least twice.",

Would Mary Kate only love Sean if she felt he had proven himself by fighting her own brother? I think that is what makes the film so disturbing.

It would be nice to conclude that this film is an ironic comment on stereotypes and the behaviour of a brutal, culturally insensitive man in the grip of a fantasy about his Irish roots Unfortunately, I'm sure Ford meant it straight. The vigour and the scenery add a gloss that makes a very questionable story highly watchable.",

For anyone living in the United Kingdom who has not seen it yet you can buy a 3 disc trilogy box set of john wayne films in Matalan for \u00a314.99 it comprises of The Quiet Man, Rooster Cogburn and Stagecoach and there was someone on ebay.co.uk but I must tell you that the subtitles were not translated into English properly.Well worth watching again and again I never get tired of this great classic. John Wayne never get much recognition for his work it was not until his illness that he was finally merited with some recognition. He was an amazing actor and will be sadly missed by all his fans.

Interesting character dynamics/interaction. I very much enjoyed Barry Fitzgerald as drunk old Michaleen, the best character in the whole movie by far.

But one of the other things that I enjoy watching is the new world versus old world conflict between Wayne's and O'Hara's characters. It's interesting to see that what he considers to be provincial and unimportant, she regards as part of the bedrock of her life. If I said anymore I'd give it away. It's one of the few films that I never tire of seeing. And it's not just Wayne and O'Hara, either. There are stellar performances from all the rest of the cast, too. The one that tickles me the most is by the one who plays the matchmaker. He also plays the lead role in \"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\" (a Disney film). Movie producers just don't seem to be able to assemble as solid a cast today as was for \"The Quiet Man\". Enjoy!",

'Birth of a Nation'? Lighten up! It's a semi-comedy about life in Ireland before World War ll. It's not supposed to reflect on life anywhere today. Values were different back when this movie was first proposed, so It couldn't possibly not be dated. The movie is a great romp through a peaceful town full of stereotypical characters shaken up by the arrival of an expatriate from America and stars some of the best actors of the period, all from John Ford's private troup. (It seems John Ford had all Irish character actors in his stable) Same characters, different names. If you didn't like 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' you won't like this movie. Finally, The movie is just fun. Not to be taken seriously, and not to be taken for more than it is: good entertainment.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers. This is such an old movie I figured it wouldn't matter too much. Read this after you've seen the movie for an avid fan's view of it.The Quiet Man is my favorite film because two major themes are the role of a woman in a traditional society and dealing with anger constructively.Mary Kate Danaher is not quite what we've come to think of as a \"traditional\" woman. She is fiery, not passive or submissive although she clearly understands her role as a woman and lives within it. She knows who she is and what she wants and resists being pushed around as much as she can within the limits that have sustained her culture for centuries. The dowry is the key to her role in society. It's a tradition that gives her dignity. Mary Kate delivers my favorite feminist speech in a film when she comes home after the wedding. The most memorable line in the speech for me is \"Without my things about me, I'm still a servant dreaming amongst the things that aren't my own.\" Without the dowry she's been handed over from one man to another with nothing of her own, so she feels like a prostitute. Makes sense to me.The other theme, anger management, explains Sean Thornton's refusal to fight for the dowry. He believes he can't fight without being mad enough to kill. To keep his wife he has to find a way to get her dowry without fighting and possibly killing her brother. He finally figures it out. Play the Irish game. Call the brother-in-law's bluff. \"It's your custom. No dowry, no marriage.\" he says to her brother. After the brother grudging hands over the dowry Sean _and_ Mary Kate burn it in front of the brother-in-law and the whole community. They all know it was never really about furniture or money. When there's no more reason to be angry the two men slug it out just to see who's the better fighter. And its a great fight scene. The fight scene alone is worth watching the movie.Technical aspects of the film are also wonderful in my opinion. I especially love the rich, beautiful technicolor images of Maureen O'Hara in Ireland. The role of Sean Thornton seems made for John Wayne. (It probably was.) But its what the film says to me that keeps me watching it over and over.",

Like all of John Ford's movies, it's a study of manners.  If you remember Ford's great film 'Fort Apache', with almost all of the major actors from 'The Quiet Man', it presents the tension between the Irish and the Anglo-aristocracy in the old army.  Just watch the formality of the Post dance, or the confrontation between Henry Fonda and Ward Bond in the latter's house. If you watch Richard Harris's performance as Bull in 'The Field', you see Red Will's character in this film, but without any comic elements.  What both films portray is greed for land, suspicion of outsiders, the appeal of self-destruction, and the resolution of conflict through violence. In 'The Quiet Man', the hero-stranger proves stronger than his local strong-man nemesis, and a happy ending is ordained.  In 'The Field', the stranger is not stronger than the local land-owner, and is murdered.  At the end, almost everyone is dead. I think 'The Field' is more honest in portraying those elements Greek tragedy which continue to underpin the realities of Irish life.",

When I was a seventh grader, we read the original short story version of \"The Quiet Man.\" and it remained one of my favorite stories until my father and I saw John Ford's seminal production of the film adaptation together. John Ford's direction packs together an entire Irish village to serve as the crucible for the deliverance of the man who in the text was Shawn Kelvin, but who in Ford's hands became Shawn Thornton. I guess that the powers that be cannot resist changing the classics once they have purchased the literary property, and of course, no one can stop them. John Wayne is at his very best and so is Maureen O'Hara. The suspenseful buildup to the confrontation between Thornton and Danaher consumes much of the movie plot whereas on the page the event is tightly compressed. Now 69 years after that movie was made, I watched it again this morning. And not only has it lost none of its charm and suspense. The final bonding of the boxer from Pittsburg and the colleen and her brother seems now to be near perfect poetic justice.",

Instead, horse and buggies, plows, fireplaces, and a community with shared values and vibrant social intercourse . How politically incorrect such a world now seems with its caste structure, all-pervasive religion and subjugation of women. In the end, Thornton (Wayne)  although smitten by this world tries to resist its essential ways but is absorbed into it and by it, and thus transformed from American to Irishman.  Hard to imagine that such a world has disappeared so rapidly and completely and in so short a time : the transformation has thus worked the opposite way, with Irishmen  now becoming Americans, metaphorically speaking.

Its counter to many of his other performances in that he avoids conflict most of the movie, while also getting to show off his comedic & romantic chops.  He's matched perfectly by Maureen O'Hara, one of the great actresses of the Golden Age of Hollywood, and between her looks and feisty personality, its no wonder Thornton falls in love at first site.  Behind the camera, John Ford (who won an unprecedented fourth Best Director Oscar for this) crafts a brilliant romantic comedy about life in Ireland, with a great cast of local actors along with subtle nods to the political conflicts cast the time (the IRA and the Catholic/Protestant conflict are addressed).  It all builds up to one of the greatest and funniest fights ever filmed, resulting a pure movie magic from beginning to end.

Something else that occurred during filming was in the scene where her hair was blowing in the wind, it kept getting in her eyes and messing her up with her performance. Ford yelled at her for it and she fired back saying, \"What would a bald-headed son of a b**** like you know about hair lashing across his eyeballs?!\" \n\nThis movie is truly magical in multiple ways, but most significantly being the cultural clash between Irish tradition and new American ways and the understanding each of them must learn in order for things to work regarding their separate social norms and customs. \n\nLastly, keep an eye on Barry Fitzgerald in the first pub scene. Cheeky old-timer tosses back two glasses of porter in less than 20 seconds and grabs a third before the scene's end.

DeMille's punishingly long blockbuster three-ring soap opera The Greatest Show On Earth did not deserve to win Best Picture.  The Quiet Man  I personally feel should have got the nod Best Picture for 1952 .  It stars John Wayne as Sean Thornton, a former heavyweight boxer who returns to fictional Innisfree, Ireland to reclaim the family farm. There's a sensitive, complicated romance-with independent-minded Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara), sister of local bully Red Danaher (Victor McLaglen, one of Ford's best company players)-but the real attraction here is Ford's masterful maneuvering of tones and his fluid handling of a large cast of colorful characters, qualities which also defined his iconic (and then-underrated) Westerns. Shot partly on location in Ireland and designed in the lushest greens ever squeezed out of Technicolor, The Quiet Man is a movie that isn't about a whole lot, but yet seems to contain so much-from Wayne's easygoing charisma to the notoriously protracted climactic fight to the febrile, film-noir-like flashback to Sean's boxing days. The Quiet Man is on of Wayne best films and his made possible by beautiful spitfire Maureen O'Hara .",

Ford reveals a little at a time and pits two men against each other over a woman who is as fiery as they come. It's an amazing build with all of the flavor you can savor, including races, fights, flashbacks, a beautiful score, characters of every color, and much more. While it isn't my favorite Ford film, it celebrates a man after a woman for all the right reasons and willing to fight for her in all the right ways. And it doesn't end with the wedding.

At this point I'm wondering if can muster the willpower to explore any more of Wayne's films because I have not enjoyed his performance yet in my first 2 experiences with him. He is a very stiff actor, and struggles to become a convincing romantic lead here. However, despite all my protestations to this film, I did enjoy moments. There were certain actors who were very good, especially Maureen O'Hara (even if I found her character annoying.) There were also some of the minor characters who gave me a chuckle, which I needed more of while watching this movie. The best part of the film, despite all the frustration I felt up to that point, was the final confrontation which somehow hooked me and I was anxious to see how it would end. One other thing that is worth mentioning was how well-restored the visuals were in the version that I watched. It truly captured the luscious beauty of Ireland. All these lovely things are nice to have in the film, but they just weren't enough to make me like The Quiet Man.

Everything from butt slapping to grabbing his wife and throwing her into bed is treated as a grand game. At one point a priest even tell O'Hara off for slapping Wayne since she should wait til they're married so he can hit back. Yuck. There is a certain extent to which older films must be judged by their own cultural standards and the viewer's own prejudices forgotten, but this entire film is in such poor taste that its appeal is entirely lost to a modern audience.

I understand that old film actors concentrated more on cultivating a persona than a character for an individual film, but Wayne's persona is neither compelling nor complex.  \nThe film's plot is contrived.  I followed the story with skepticism throughout much of it until it devolved into the most ludicrous fight scene that I could imagine, and then I just rolled my eyes and waited for it to be over.\nWhat strikes me most is the film's misogyny.  Mary's insistence for her own money and all the male characters' resistance bespeaks of a lack of male respect for female identity and self-sufficiency.  The characters and the film itself wreak of over-whelming male superiority, and when Mary agrees to serve them dinner, I couldn't help but conclude that this was a film condemned to its time.\nOverall, maybe there's a film that will make me like John Wayne, but this isn't it.",

            "content": "Before I review this, let me say that my uncle is an obsessive fan of John Wayne. Knowing how big I am on film, especially my growing interest in classics, he always goes up to me and says, \"Hey, you need to see The Quiet Man.\", or \"Hey, you need to see North to Alaska.\", or \"Hey, you need to see Big Jake.\". But the problem is, John Wayne, while he's a fine actor, I'm not too fond of the films he's in, especially True Grit. The only Wayne films that I've seen that are worth 100% are The Searchers, Rio Bravo, and The Longest Day. But, I have interest in watching these kinds of films, so when I discovered a copy of The Quiet Man in my local library, I just couldn't resist. But unfortunately, despite the fact that it's one of Wayne's most acclaimed films, #2 in most critic's list, I just wasn't a huge fan of it, even if it is directed by Wayne buddy John Ford.\r\n\r\nJohn Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an American boxer who returns to his Irish roots to escape his troubled past. Immediately, he falls for the lovely Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), but soon faces conflicts with her grumpy brother (Victor McLaglen) over the relationship and his decision to purchase his own land that he was trying to buy for himself. When Thornton and the woman marry, Red Will, the brother, goes as far as stealing her fortune and intimidate them both. Sean must reface his troubled past in order to end his troubles.\r\n\r\nJohn Ford is an excellent director, don't get me wrong. He's made loads of stellar films in his career, including the classic film (with Wayne) The Searchers, How Green Was My Valley, and The Grapes of Wrath. But The Quiet Man isn't my favorite.\r\n\r\nHere are some things I liked about the film. First, the cinematography is fantastic. Well, it helped that the film was actually shot on location in Ireland itself, which, in reality, which was where director John Ford grew up. Had in been filmed in some Hollywood backlot, I would have given it a lower score. And I'm not kidding. \r\n\r\nI was also highly impressed with the score by Victor Young. It's tense, it's exciting, and it's moving. It managed to get me going when I was struggling with other issues with the film, which I'll get to in a minute.\r\n\r\nYou may think I have some problem with John Wayne, but no, he's an excellent actor, I'm just not the biggest fan. Here, Wayne delivers, especially in scenes where he discusses his character's troubled past. The scene where we witness a key moment in his past might be my favorite scene, with the stunning camera shots and the actor's facial expressions in the outcome of a certain boxing incident. Maureen O'Hara also stuns as the love interest. I was impressed with the two's chemistry, which is probably why they did so many films together. My favorite moment here is when he grabs her and does a big kiss on her, which was later imitated in the Steven Spielberg classic ET. I was also impressed by their physical emotions, such as a scene where Wayne comforts O'Hara from a storm in a graveyard. I also liked Victor McLaglen as the town bully. He is a pretty good intimidator, and has some excellent scenes with Wayne.\r\n\r\nNow here's when I start criticizing the film. My uncle promised me that this film was very funny, but he lied. To begin, this is not a comedy, this is a drama. A heavy, serious, romantic, drama. Yeah, there was some form of comedy coming from the supporting actors, but the comedy felt extremely forced and I couldn't find anything to laugh about, especially when a preacher falls into a pond while attempting to catch a fish. While that would be funny if the person was Charlie Chaplin, it really failed miserably here. If you want to watch John Wayne in a comedy, this isn't it. McLintock is just another John Wayne film away.\r\n\r\nAlso, why were there moments of song in this? This is not a musical. I thought my uncle hated musicals (well, his one exception was Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, so he claims). The singing in the Irish pub annoyed me and kind of ruined the flow of the picture. Even a drunken Wayne attempting to sing didn't help either.\r\n\r\nBut the biggest problem I had with The Quiet Man was the film's climax. On the DVD cover, the film promised \"the longest brawl ever filmed.\" But instead, I was treated to a brawl, but instead of physical contact, we witness locals' bets on the outcome and a heavy crowd blocking the way, and like I mentioned earlier, forced comedy that doesn't help the dramatic flow of the film. When we actually do see the actual brawl, one punch, and it's over. Now that's what I call false advertising. Definitely one of the most disappointing, anticlimactic fight scene I've ever witnessed. You know the climax is a big disappointment when the film's most exciting scene is a small horserace in the middle of the film.\r\n\r\nSo in the end, The Quiet Man has an excellent John Wayne performance, and the score and cinematography were outstanding, the film suffers from some dry, unfunny comedy, some painfully annoying pub songs, and the most disappointing climax a man could ever witness. It had it's moments, but I wasn't completely wowed by the experience",

Soon he is befriended by the proper yet kindly folk in the quaint town. Also, a beautiful red-haired girl catches his eye one day. Fireworks start between the American and the proud brother, so he will not condone the courtship or marriage of his sister. Finally, Wayne does gain his wife but she is unhappy without her dowry and she believes her husband is a coward since he will not fight for it. Little does she know the past he tried to escape, but once he gets it off his chest, he does fight. Through the exciting event both men grow fond of each other and the town gets a kick out of the entertainment. O'Hara and the rest of the cast including Barry Fitzgerlad are wonderful as the Irish folk, all playing off the Quiet Man.",

            "content": "I've seen this film many times over the years, and it has really stood out to me as being one of Ford's best films. Primarily known for his westerns, I love how this one is more atypical. It also helps that I've got a fair amount of Irish ancestry in me, thus can better appreciate this being a wonderful love letter to The Emerald Isle.\n\nThe story is that of Irish American boxer Sean Thornton who returns to the small Irish village of his birth. Distraught after having accidentally killed a man in the ring, all he wants is to live out the rest of his life peacefully and quietly on his family's land, which is no easy task, as he soon incurs the ire of the squire- a local brute who was wanting the land for himself. \n\nNot only that, but Sean falls in love with the squire's sister, a feverishly traditional and fiery woman who insists that her and Sean's courtship be by the books, which includes receiving a dowry...that her brother refuses to pay. The couple get married, but until that dowry is received, the marriage absolutely won't be consummated.\n\nWhat follows is a gloriously jolly romp that shows Sean trying to prove he's a real man without always having to resort to violence, which he is of course reluctant to do given his past.\n\nYes, the movie does perpetuate a few stereotypes about Irish men loving to drink and fight, but it could be far worse. The film has a fun set up, great supporting characters, and, since it was shot on location, it features Ireland in all of its glory with some truly marvelous cinematography.  The music is also quite nice as well, and it's not surprising that this has become THE movie to watch every St. Patrick's Day as a result.\n\nWayne gives a fine performance, and it is nice seeing him in a role like this where he actual does have to try to act and show off his dramatic chops. He's successful too. Maureen O'Hara basically cemented her career here as Mary Kate the love interest, and for better or worse, she's the embodiment of a gorgeous prototypical Irish lass.  Victor McLaglen is great as her bullying brother, and the great aforementioned supporting characters are superbly played by Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald, and Mildred Natwick among others.\n\nDefinitely give this one a watch. It's got drama, romance, comedy, action, and really leaves you feeling great inside.",

The whole cast seems to be engaged in a labor of love, and their happiness at filming the movie comes through in their performances. The story itself is entertaining and heart-warming, although the end is never in doubt. This is probably John Wayne's most genuine performance, it being so obvious he feels comfortable inhabiting the skin of Sean Thornton, his character. The whole cast were very good friends, indeed many of them were family, and their chemistry is quite real and vivid on screen. I highly recommend this movie!",

The fact that it was an older film didn't bother me at all, as some of my favorite films are older. But in the end, I ended up liking this film quite a lot. Wayne does a fine job in his role, the rest of the Irish townsfolk are rather fun, and Wayne's rival is a believable guy who isn't really a jerk but just doesn't trust the new guy (Wayne) in town yet. The film has several funny moments which would stand out in today's realm of what is usually considered funny, being as though there is no crude humor. Nope, none. It's just all smart, ironic, and neat. The fact that the whole film was shot in Ireland makes it even better. The only two things which really bugged me at all were; the leading lady, Maureen O'Hara's, acting. I never really cared for her character at all, which when she is one of the two main, it's really a bother, and the occasional random songs which the townsfolk would sing. It reminded me of musicals, and I frigging HATE musicals. Overall though, The Quiet Man really is a great film.",

It's easily one of the most visually breathtaking films I have seen. Ford's love of tradition and community shines through more in this film than maybe any other that he made. The little fictional town of Innisfree, located on the Irish countryside makes for one of the most lively and authentic communities in any film; and it is always great to revisit now and again.\n\nDuke, Fitzgerald, McLaglen, and O'Hara are all perfect.

What I really liked about the issues raised in this film is that the film answers how the main character deals with it and also leaves you wondering about the issues yourself. And while the film does raise some intellectual questions, it is also very entertaining to watch. The chemistry between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara is very evident and very charming. I also really loved the plot of the film. It's very easy to follow and also at the same time doesn't feel over simplified. The Quiet Man is one of those rare experiences that absolutely engrosses you with beautiful scenery, fabulous acting, a wonderful story and a sweet romance that builds to a realistic level as the film goes on. If you love John Wayne films, or even if you're not a fan of John Wayne, this film is a must see. It's a cinematic experience I won't soon be forgetting. \r\n\r\n9.8/10",

Upon his arrival, he meets a colorful array of characters, including the fiery Kate Danaher (played exquisitely by Hollywood's Irish lass herself, Maureen O'Hara) and the somewhat bibulous Irishman Michaleen Oge Flynn (the downright precious Barry Fitzgerald).

This movie was wonderfully Irish (even if stereotypical) and it was hilarious. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because there were a few questionable parts (",

It's so full of life and has so much to say about relationships, culture and tradition. Most importantly, it's about the idea of a home and a future. The performances are wonderful, as are the characters. I think the storytelling structure is extremely unconventional and more exclusive to reality rather than the typical love story. John Ford also directs this movie in a way that makes it unforgettable. The landscape, colors, style and scope are so beautiful and something unique. There wont ever be a movie like it.",

The Quiet man is a quaint little movie that combines a sweepingly romantic story, clever humor, and beautiful cinematography to a perfect concoction of a great John Ford movie. What makes it extra special, is the perfect chemistry between its two leads and suprise! John Wayne doesn't play a G.I. or a cowboy! He really shows his merit as an actor, giving a subtle and sensitive yet still brooding with masculinity take on one of his most perplexing characters. The film is a must-see for all good catholics and Irishmen alike.\r\n\r\nThe studio originally wanted to shoot the film outside its actual location, but thank god John Ford went to Ireland to shoot this movie! It has to be one of the most beautiful films ever made. A feast for your eyes, the sparkly and rolling green hills of Ireland are expertly captured and the early use of technicolor is flawless. If you need a movie that you can turn off the sound and just appreciate the beauty of the film, I would say that Lawrence of Arabia and this film would both be on that list. \r\n\r\nIt is when you listen to it though, that the movie really shines. The film is cleverly humorous with many aspects of Irish culture weaved into its story. The film follows Sean Thornton, a retired prizefighter who goes to his homeland after a fatal knockout leaves his career in shambles. he quickly falls in love with a young woman but their love is soon troubled as her brother refuses to give up the dowry and their wedding is deemed unofficial to Irish customs. The dowry will not be given up without a fight, so Sean must soon come out of his newly pacifist shell and face his enemy through the passion of his love.\r\n\r\nJohn Wayne never really struck me as an actor, but his performance in this movie makes up for even his biggest flops (Yes, even The Green Berets). It was great seeing him play the non-aggressor but as the film builds up to the famous \"Queensbury rules\" fight, it was still nice to see classic Duke in action. Maureen O'Hara is also a strong performer, she reminds me a lot of my sister in this film so I felt a bit more personally connected to her character. What usually makes rom-coms fail is a lack of chemistry, thankffully this film has perfect chemistry between the couple, which makes for a sweepingly romantic and richly fufilling film.\r\n\r\nI am a good Catholic boy, so I automatically loved the Irish culture and the romance was one of my favorite save maybe Casablanca. If you love Ireland, romance, or just want to see the Duke in a non-typecasted role, The Quiet Man is a perfect movie.",

However his performance in this was brilliant as it showed what a good actor he is , with some top notch performances by Maureen O Hara who shows how hard life was like for women in the time period and plays the love intrest of the main character. While Victor McLagen who puts in a splendid performance as he plays the main Villain of the movie which shows that the main crew was excellent and the three of them would star in more movies together. \r\n\r\nI think John Ford did a good job directing the movie even tho he is associated with directing war films and western alongside John Wayne but can show that he can direct other types of geners by directing this movie as he keeps the viewer gripped in to watch the movie.   \r\n\r\noverall The quiet Man is a excellent Film as it shows what a Man will do to be with the woman he loves and following the trials and customs of his homeland Ireland",

            "content": "A slice of the old country, the little people and the blarney is very much enjoyed in The Quiet Man. It's essentially a western set in Western Ireland but has all the beautiful detail one expects in Ford films. \r\n\r\nThe plot follows that of the classic western meets taming of the shrew. \r\n\r\nStranger comes to town. \r\nFalls for the sister of the town's most powerful man who is also a tough fighting man. \r\nConflict arises between stranger and local tough guy. \r\nA further conflict occurs between feisty femme and the stranger. \r\nThe inevitable showdown happens.\r\nAnd the good guy wins the fight and the woman's heart. \r\n\r\nThe plot may sound basic, but the beauty of this film is in great locations, fine performances and a cracking script with plenty of the Irish craic. It's the humour and undeniable charm that really carries the movie along and is only interrupted by several beautiful pools of romance in the middle of the knockabout comedy/drama.  \r\n\r\nDirector Ford may only have had one eye but probably saw much more than those with two eyes and 20-20 vision. It's his eye for the detail that make this movie especially memorable. Throughout the movie you feel like you are in the west of Ireland, almost one of the locals of Innisfree as you go inside the pub, the humble cottage, the church, the farmhouses and join the locals in the rolling greenery of the Irish countryside. \r\n\r\nThe first confrontation between Sean Thornton (played excellently by John Wayne) and Red Will Danaher(equally good stuff from Victor McLaglan) has almost everything. \r\n\r\nThe romance of the wee Irish pub, the friendliness of the locals once Sean Thornton's identity has been revealed and the music starts - Wild Colonial Boy sung by none other than country and western singer Ken Curtis - Ford's real life son in law as the accordion playing Dermot Fahy. It hardly gets more Irish than this. \r\n\r\nEnter Red Will looking for fight. The brilliant dialogue follows \"I said good morning\" Sean declares. \"Aye but it was good night you had in your mind\" Red Will accuses Sean of making an ungentlemanly pass at his sister Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara). The tension mounts. \r\n\r\nFord's real life brother Francis Ford plays an old man in the pub and is central to this early scene - acting almost like a referee in between the two hulks of Sean and Red Will. In the end religious intervention in the form of the unlikely but convincing Ward Bond's Fr Lonnigan saves a full-blown fistfight. But it is only delaying the inevitable. The tone for the whole movie is set.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is superb performances and Ford has his usual team in harness here with Wayne and McLaglan leading the way. Maureen O'Hara who plays Mary Kate Danaher is at her radiant feisty best and probably never looked more beautiful in a movie. Then there is Barry Fitzgerald whose character is part leprechaun, part barfly and as the movie progresses he pops up as a jack of all trades - taxi service, matchmaker, bookmaker and even furniture removal man. He steals many scenes with his great acting and his presence certainly adds all the charm you would expect to find in leprechauns. \r\n\r\nIt's certainly one of Ford's finest and has an epic fight at the end, which is not brutal, but merely cartoon violence that Tarantino would be proud of. \r\n\r\nSo with wild Irish humour, accordion and loud piano music, jaunty Irish pub songs, meaty confrontations, flames of red haired Irish folk and a big fight, you might ask why this film is called The Quiet Man. Well here's the real conflict and the great irony of the title. Sean Thornton is a retired boxer and has returned to his hometown from Pittsburgh to enjoy \"the quiet life\". He gets anything but tranquillity and has to emerge from his conscience, morals and indeed motives to fight for the right to have a quiet life and a beautiful wife - who is a shrew needing tamed as she prods her man to fight for her pride. \r\n\r\nThe Quiet Man is a classic and one of Ford's standouts among his amazing canon of great work. He shows us a post revolution Ireland at it's finest. A movie that never tires through repeat viewings, this is must for the DVD collection and whenever you're feeling down it is a perfect pick me up, just insert disc, press play and let the great John Ford take you to the Emerald Isle and all it's wonder.",

Something close to that.\n\nSean Thornton killed a man in the boxing ring. He's ashamed and wants to forget it. He returns to the Irish cottage he grew up in. That's where he finds Mary Kate and wants to wed her. I never really knew of Maureen O' Hara in any other films I can think of, but I gotta tell you she is so beautiful. She notches up my vote for the most beautiful red head ever. Well, that's just my opinion.\n\nThe only problem for Sean when it comes to Mary Kate is two things: Her bullying brother Red and her dowry which is the more important to her than anything else. Sean doesn't care for her money. He loves her and that's that. \n\nThe brother on the other doesn't like Sean and since due to some Irish custom, won't let Sean court his sister Mary Kate. Luckily, a few of the locals trick the brother into letting him think that the widow tillane wants to marry him unless Mary Kate is out of the house. But it's on the wedding day where Red discovers he's been had and decides to keep Mary Kate's dowry from her.\n\nSean is stuck with being called a coward by Mary Kate if he doesn't return her dowry back to her from her brother. And then finally, the ending which is probably one of the most hilarious fights ever put to film when Sean and Red box eachother pretty much all over Innisfree, the small town.\n\nI can see why my late grandma Marjorie called this film her favorite. It's sweet and endearing. My favorite part would have to be when Sean enters the home he grew up to only find that somebody has tidied up the place. It was sweet Mary Kate. She hides in the back room. It's windy. Something startle's her as she makes her way to the front door, but It's Sean who stops her. The door wide up, the wind blowing in as Sean plants a kiss on Mary Kate. \n\nOne of the best kissing scenes ever. ;)",

Watch it and you'll understand what I mean. You can tell that everyone from the director down to the last grip did their jobs correctly. When I'm missing a place that I love very much and my memories aren't as fresh as they used to be, I pop this DVD in and relive a time beyond time. It was shot so beautifully that there are times it has a dreamlike quality. I can almost see Sean Thornton and Mary Kate Danaher walking together through the fields. I can almost smell the Heather.

The story is enjoyable and not one would expect to see John Wayne star in.  Good to see The Duke in a different setting.  Maureen O'Hara had an amazing performance.  Looking forward to seeing more of her movies in the future.  Interesting to see the portrayal of Ireland at the period of time.  The story follows a man moving back to the nation of his birth.  Hijinks ensue as he becomes acclimated to the people and customs of his homeland. Highly recommend watching this gem.",

Sean Thornton (John Wayne) travels back to Ireland, the land of his fathers, after being raised in the US, only to find himself in love with the redhead Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara). Her brother, however, doesn't take kindly to Thornton, and, as a result, drama ensues. I say \"drama\", but this movie is so upbeat with its Irish charm and humor, I would say it's a cozy watch if you want to get in a good mood. It is a prime example of the beauty of technicolor, and the wardrobe is on-point. It's not the greatest John Wayne movie, but, by God, it's the very definition of underrated. Even the musical score is fantastic. Good for adults and children alike. Children will find the third act especially fun. And if you're into boxing/MMA, you may very well appreciate it, too. A great film for couples, as well. The way marriage was handled back then is a fascinating subject matter.",
