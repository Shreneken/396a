            "content": "The African Queen is a significant historical film in two respects. Along with King Solomon's Mines it was the first American film to show the real Africa to the American public. Previously our ideas about Africa were gleaned from studio backlot jungles created for Tarzan films and the like. The African Queen changed all that, no cheap studio sets would do any more.But also, The African Queen dealt with romance among mature adults in their forties. A ne'er do well river pilot on a ramshackle boat and the spinster sister of a missionary, thrown together by the circumstance of war. Humphrey Bogart, our intrepid river pilot, makes a scheduled stop to deliver mail to the mission run by Robert Morley and Katharine Hepburn. And he breaks the news to them that World War I has started. Almost as soon as he leaves them, German troops from East Africa come to call. Bogie comes back and he finds Kate with her dead brother. They bury him and skedaddle. And while skedaddling they conceive of a cockeyed plan to help in the war effort.To say what it is and what happens would spoil the story, but let me say this. The original opening of the film with Bogart coming in as church services are being conducted for a few hundred uncomprehending native Africans is Director John Huston's comment on the usefulness of the lives Morley and Hepburn have led up to that point. What Hepburn and Bogart accomplish by the end of the film makes up for the waste that was Hepburn's life.But The African Queen is a great romance as well. Bogart became a great romantic star in Casablanca and he upholds the tradition here, winning an Academy Award for Best Actor. Katie Hepburn doesn't seem to miss her usual partner Spencer Tracy not a bit, the part of Rose Sayer is a perfect fit. As was remarked, they're going to have stories to tell their grandkids.When I watch The African Queen I'm reminded of what Bogart's friend Frank Sinatra sang in one of his best ballads about how Love Isn't Just For the Young. Kate and Bogie sure prove it here.",

It's a lot of fun to watch, and it is also a film you can admire for the expert way it was put together.Bogart and Hepburn not only give great performances, they are also wonderful together, and they make the on-screen relationship between their characters believable and interesting - it's great to watch as it develops.  The adventures that they find are that much more entertaining for the way that you come to care about them.  The story itself is exciting, too, with a lot of ups and downs for the heroes.  Topping it off are the wonderful settings, with a lot of fine shots of wild animals and jungle scenery - there is always plenty to look at, and it also sets off the action nicely.Any one of a number of things would make \"The African Queen\" worth watching, and as a whole it is a terrific movie.  It's a must-see for any fan of classic movies, and one that you can also enjoy watching numerous times.",

            "content": "THE African QUEEN is probably one of the most widely available films in the world, on sale in the electronics department of virtually every major retail chain, a commonplace at every rental counter, frequently seen on television. It is hard to imagine any one in the western world, especially in the United States, who has not seen the film at least once--and probably more than once. And so we take it for granted.That is a mistake. Based on the famous C.S. Forester novel, which it follows quite closely, THE African QUEEN is the simple story of pragmatic river-rat Charlie Allnut (Bogart) and high-minded Methodist missionary spinster Rose Sayer (Hepburn) who are thrown together by chance when German troops sweep through Africa during World War I. Once safely aboard his beat-up riverboat \"The African Queen,\" Allnut desires nothing more than to dodge the Germans until war's end; Rose, however, determines to strike a blow against the Germans by sailing the boat downriver to attack a German battleship.There are so many fine things about this movie that they are hard to innumerate. Filmed on location in the Congo, the cinematography is remarkably fine without being obtrusive; the script, which is at once subtle and very purposeful, has a remarkably natural tone; the two stars--who play the vast majority of the film alone together--give justly famous performances; and Huston's direction is so fine that we never feel even the slightest hint of directorial manipulation. As an adventure, it has a sense of realism that most adventure stories lack; as a character study it is remarkably detailed and finely wrought; as a love story, it is quite touching without engaging in common sentimentality. And it can be enjoyed by many people of diverse backgrounds and ages without the faintest qualm.If you haven't seen THE African QUEEN in a while (or heaven forbid never seen it at all) don't take it for granted thinking you'll catch it sooner or later. Sit down with the film and watch it with fresh eyes. You'll be amazed.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

Oscar winner Bogart's Charlie is a broken man who finds true hope and happiness in Hepburn's Rose. Rose finds love and meaning from Charlie. It's adorable to see them call each other \"Missus\" and \"Mr. Almont\" even when we know that they love each other. Even when they have their \"first quarrel\" near the end of the picture, we know that their lives have changed forever as a result of the other person. It's a film about true love. This is also a very funny film, which was a shock to director Huston. Bogart's stomach growling scene early on in the film is a hoot. More humor commences as both stars play off of each other wonderfully. The scenary is beautiful. No film has captured the essence and importance of nature better than this classic. This is the film that sparked other romance adventures such as \"Romancing the Stone\" and \"Six Days and Seven Nights.\" Before you view those newer installments, you better check out the one and true original classic.",

            "content": "This is one of those films whose special effects and scenery must have been astounding at the time (1951), but which seem mediocre at best today. BUT, and that's a big 'but', this does not detract from the greatness of the movie overall. The scenery truly is beautiful, for one thing--and the direction and cinematography is great. However, what truly makes this film a classic, and deservedly so, is the performances given by the lead actors. For their one film together, Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn pull out all the stops. Bogart is crude, dirty and a low-life river-rat with a heart of gold. He gives the Oscar-winning performance of his lifetime. Hepburn is prim and prissy, but always manages to win us over with her radiance and vulnerability, as well as that core of steel and strength she lends to all her on-screen characters. He's charming, in his way; she's achingly beautiful in hers. You can't help but warm to Charlie and Rosie, and truly, genuinely root for them to get together.\nThe ending is predictable; all 'opposites-attract' romance adventure stories are. You know without a doubt that the sunset will be there for Charlie and Rosie to ride off (or swim) into together. But you still hurt when Charlie hurts; and you still smile like a fool when he sees Rose, and when he tries to explain her forthrightness away by jungle fever. You believe the love, and that's what the African Queen is all about.Oh, and the gin and leech scenes, of course. Those are brilliant, as everyone else here has already mentioned! ;)",

            "content": "He loves his boat and knows the African river like his pocket. She loves her country and believes in accomplishment driven by faith and patriotism. It's all natural that the two main protagonists of \"The African Queen\" turn the titular boat into the unsung heroine of a military deed, whose success is as improbable as the very thought that a straight-laced Methodist missionary spinster would fall in love with a coarse, rudimentary and gin-soaked mailman, but not so when the romance serves as the very fuel of that mission, and when it's Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn and John Huston on the lead: the miracle of \"The African Queen\", as movie and story, is the result of three immense talents confidently maneuvering in the same direction.Film historian and critic Richard Schickel said about Hepburn that her secret appeal relied on the characters she usually played: \"a woman on her high horse with slightly pretentious, often comically stated ideas about the world. It was for men to bring her down and get her to reveal herself as quite a good gal, sporty and democratic\" generally, the task would fall to \"slightly rough-necked and good-natured male\" But for once, \"The African Queen\" provides an interesting twist to the usual formula, because it's Rose who gets Charlie on her horse. The effect is even greater because it forces Bogart to abandon his tough-guy facade, and (for once again) play a man who tries to please a woman. Huston's \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" had already demonstrated a new range of versatility in Bogart's acting, but even as the anti-heroic Fred C. Dobbs, Bogart was exuding a threatening toughness; as Allnut, it's a new step on his career, as a more lovable kind of loser, in a performance that will earn him an Oscar for Best Actor (Hepburn, Huston and James Agee for the screenplay will also be nominated). The word 'loser' might sound too harsh, but it's still better than coward, which seems to fit Allnut's initial plan to avoid trouble and hide in a spot with enough supply of gin, waiting for that worldwide war (the first) to stop. Too bad for him, he's got Hepburn aboard, an iron-lady who followed her bother (Robert Morley) in German East Africa only to witness the efforts of a lifetime being burned down by the Kaiser's army, a fatal shock for the brother.But Rose is stronger than her ill-fated brother and when she accepts to set off aboard \"The African Queen\", she's most determined to be part of the conflict, not in the victim's departments. And the glorious boat, becomes the unlikely arena of two one dominant and one dominated spirit in Allnut, treating Rose as a lady, until he finds out that she's not a passive and fear-stricken female observer. It's indeed Rose who suggests the idea of building a torpedo, out of oxygen cylinders and inflammable material, to destroy a German ship blocking the way to British ships from a lake downriver. Allnut argues that it's going to a certain death, they'll have to navigate along a German fort, to negotiate a few rapids, to get mired on mud across dense reeds, their chances of survival are mighty slim. An unflappable Rose then confronts Allnut to his own responsibilities as both a man, and a Canadian subject of the Union Jack brandished by the boat, and Allnut, not to lose face, accepts with reluctance.But we know it's a matter of time before Rose drives Allnut all nut, he finally gives himself a little one-to-one gin-soaked party, driving enough anger to finally take his promise back, disappointing his distinguished and courageous host. He wakes up with one hell of a hangover and all his emptied bottles floating on the river; trying to make amends from his behavior, he explains that his drinking is only expression of human nature, to which he gets the greatest cinematic come-back ever \"nature, Mr Allnut is what we're put in this world to rise above\", and the line resonates as the film's motto. It's never about what we have at hands, but what we can build on it. Rosie ignites the fire of bravery in Allnut, and the exhilarating cross of the first obstacles lead to the victorious embrace, sealing the existence of a love that got from one heart to the other, through a taped adrenalin-filled boiler hose, and a few rows as tumultuous as the rapids.This is not Hollywood corny romantic comedy; this is John Huston confronting two genuine characters one another, an inspirational believer and a practical technician, both combining their strengths for survival and accomplishment. Katharine Hepburn might play her usual 'strong woman' role but she's never mean-spirited. On the other hand, Bogie is clearly in love with his 'Rosie', he admires her and can see that she's changing him for the better, it's not just about forming a couple, but being a team, not just about being a team, but improving, for love and for duty, whether for sharing a tent during under a heavy storm, to fix a propeller underwater or to even accept that God is still the one who has the last word. That's \"The African Queen\": thrilling, romantic, inspiring, starring the two stars, honored by the American Film Institute as the greatest screen legends, Bogart and Hepburn, in interactions full of comedy given the opposition of their personalities and a believable chemistry built on trust, incentive and partnership, this is not 'holding-hands' heroism \u00e0 la \"Titanic\", each step is tackled with technical precision. Which makes the climactic duel with the Germans a bit less realistic by contrast but this is another aspect of Hollywood's immortal classics, sometimes; every single element has not to be taken seriously for a triumphal ending. Indeed, when you have great actors, great writing and great director on the tiller, the story can surely navigate its way to legend.",

            "content": "WW1, East Africa, after her brother is killed by invading German troops, Rose Sayer is reliant on gruff steamboat captain, Charlie Allnut, to ferry her safely out of harms way and back to civilisation. Trouble is is that they are poles apart in ideals and ways, she is a devoted missionary, he a hard drinking tough nut with a glint in his eye. Yet as they venture further down the river, an unlikely alliance is starting to form, both in personalities and a keenness to give it to the Germans!It's probably something of a given that The African Queen was starting with an advantage from the very first cry of action! Because to have Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn as your lead actors is not to be sniffed at, whilst also having John Huston directing is stacking the odds heavily in your favour. Thankfully history and time show us that all involved in this piece crafted a most delightful and exciting picture, yet it triumphs more as an intriguing picture than merely a meeting of Hollywood giants. Adapted by Huston and James Agee from the novel by C.S. Forester, it's believed that the original intention was to film it as an outright drama, but whether by star design or a going with the flow attitude, the picture turned out to be a drama fused with splices of humour, the kind where the tongue gets firmly stuck in the cheek.As character pieces go, The African Queen has few peers, especially in the pantheon of 50s cinema, then you add the excellent story to work from, with the location work in Congo and Uganda expertly utilised by Huston (clearly revelling in the mix) and his photographer, Jack Cardiff. Then there is that magical flow, just as The African Queen (the boat itself) is flowing down the river, so does the film effortlessly glide along without pretentious posturing, screaming out that this is as a humane a story as you are likely to witness again. Some cynical reviewers will point to the dated studio filmed segments as a reason why this film shouldn't be termed a classic amongst classics, but really it's only an issue if you want it to dim your appreciation of the splendour from every other frame. From Bogart and his wry or humorous expressions, to Hepburn and the art of acting prim, this is a pure joy and justly it deserves to make all those lists containing greatest films of all time. 10/10",

The \"African Queen\" is one such film. The great John Huston took a boatload of cameras, a case of whiskey, film cargo, and two legendary actors and pitted them against the African elements. In doing so, an immortal saga was created. The story is that of bush river Captain Charlie Allnut, (Humphrey Bogart) being challenged by a spinster, named Rose 'Rosy' Sayer, who has tragically lost her missionary brother, (Robert Morley), to sail down the treacherous and formidable Zambeeze river. Once there, the plan is to sail out on Lake Victoria, engage and destroy a German warship named the Louisia. An insane voyage to be sure and one filled with many other terrors such as man eating crocodiles, swarms of flesh eating mosquito's and blood-sucking, black water leeches. The film is typical Huston and many believe that the scene where Bogart is pulling the tiny boat through the reed-lined African swamp, earned him his very first well deserve Oscar. For his fans, this is a classic which lives in the treasured moments of cinematic history. *****",

Thank goodness for Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart.  John Huston's adaptation of C.S. Forester's The African Queen was solid.  And the decision to film on location in Africa helped develop the concept of nature as a viable character within the plot helps solidify the film. But without Katharine Hepburn, and Humphry Bogart, this film could have been reduced to a nice little travelog on the beauty and terror of African and the pretty animals living there. Within The African Queen each character undergoes metamorphosis. Charlie Alnutt grows from an apathetic man who enjoys the inside of a bottle, to a courageous man. Rosie in turn allows herself to be human, and vulnerable perhaps for the first time in her life. With lesser actors these changes would have appeared rushed, unexplained,and a dull beginning to an inexplicable romance. But it isn't. It's a captivating film. Rosie's brittle smile, Charlie's face as his vices are destroyed, these are moments of brilliance in an incredible film. I highly recommend it.It's also worth noting that this was not an easy film to make. These performances survived crew and cast illnesses, constant mechanical errors and inclement weather. For more about the conditions it was created under, I suggest you read Katherine Hepburn's The Making of The African Queen or How I went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Huston and almost lost my mind. She's not the sanest author in the world, but all the more enjoyable.",

I'm shocked a well-known film with these actors still isn't available on DVD in Region 1, as of late 2006. The two actors squabble in the beginning but I like the fact that the film didn't go on too long in that regard as they did in many old-time battle-of-the-sexes movies. The story also a little unusual in that neither lead actor is in his/her prime, meaning it's almost a middle-age romance story.Once they become enamored with each other, the movie mainly goes into the trials the two have in piloting this boat, \"The African Queen\" down river with the goal of reaching a German ship and blowing it up. Yes, it's a World War II movie, of sorts.To be honest, the film does slow down a bit in the beginning of Bogie and Hepburn's romance but the last 30 minutes finish strong with one obstacle after another hitting the pair of adventurers, and it's interesting to watch.",

            "content": "Directed by John Huston & based on the 1935 novel of the same name by C. S. Forester, this call to adventure/romantic film tells the story of two mismatched personalities, rough-and-ready, but coarse, boat captain Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) & prissy and proper, British Methodist, Rose Sayer (Katherine Hepburn), colliding together on a tramp steamer, as both travel down steam on Ulanga River, in an attempt to escape from the German, during the start of World War 1. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while this movie is one of the classics of Hollywood adventure filmmaking. It is without a few faults. First off, the pacing for this movie is way off. Everything happen, way too quickly. A very good example is how the war was introduce in the opening. It's weird that Mr. Allnut would spill exposition about what was happening in Europe, only to leave, a few seconds before German soldiers raid the village. Wouldn't the troops, notice his ship!? After all, supposedly 'the African Queen' is wanted by the Germans. Another good example of the film, going too quickly, is how Katherine Hepburn's character comes off, too strong about taking vengeance against the German after the raid. For somebody who is in Christian missionary. She really does seem to want to kill a lot of people! She seems like a psychopath in certain scenes in this film. Also, it was a bit off that she knows a lot of information about making torpedoes for somebody living in a farm in the jungle of Africa, away from machinery. Then, you got Charlie; for a tough guy, he's such a push-over. He didn't even angry about all the gin, being poured out. Since, we are at it, it was a bit out of the blue, that alcoholic like himself, can quit, cold turkey, and be able to function, without much problems with withdrawal. You would think, he would get sick or something. Then, there is the love affair, Allnut & Sayer developed, in their short trip. It was a bit implausible. Don't get me wrong, I get that, being in consent danger, does force people to live for the moment, but I thought, the screenwriters: James Agee, John Huston, John Collier and Peter Viertel should, at least, leave some room for it to develop much slower. It's a bit off, that both were willing to die for each other and their country. After all, it's weird to see Charlie, be OK on using his only ship that he loved as a barring ram. Even, the ending was a bit awkward. Did they make it to Kenya or not!? Also, what happen to the rest of the sailors!? It's feel to me that they didn't have an ending pick, since rumor has it, they had three altered endings. Despite that jarring climax, there were a lot of good things about the film, as well. For starters, I like the fact that the movie was in color and mostly film in location in Uganda and the Congo. However, I did think the movie went, a little overboard on the animal sound effects. Trust me, the jungle isn't that noisy. Still, it did really help, the film by having Bogart and Hepburn there. I like how both of them, look sweaty and weather-beaten the entire film. It made the film look so accurate to what the climate is like. The acting of the two principal actors - Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn - is some of the strongest ever registered on film, even if Hepburn was playing her generic type of a character, a strong will woman & Bogart wouldn't pull off, a British cockney accent, so the character was rewritten as Canadian. While, both were still past their prime, both made their characters, likable to a point that I can look past, their faults and their age, even if their character's sexuality for each other was a bit uneasy to watch. After all, seeing rapids making Rose wet between the legs was not what I wanted. Despite that, I still glad to see that Bogart's role won him his only Oscar, while Hepburn would add yet another nomination to her impressive collection. It's also nice to see to John Huston get nominated for an award as well. I really don't know, how he finished directing the film, with all the production troubles like sickness, bad weather and animal attacks, his cast and crew, went through. Nevertheless, what they filmed were some of the best work, I ever saw in a small boat movie. It was so good that the movie was part of the inspiration for the Jungle Cruise attraction at Disneyland in California. Even the action sequences in the steamer were intense. Because of the dangers of the water, all of the scenes with the performers swimming in it, were filmed in the United Kingdom, including the rapid shots. Regardless, it made one hell of a ride! In the end, I have to say, if you like this movie, also check out the 1977 TV movie of the same name starring Warren Oates and Mariette Hartley. Rather than being a remake, the plot continues after the events of the original story, with the couple having to transport a 75 mm cannon, down the river. It's not as bad, as people make it out to be. Also, check out, 1990's film, 'White Hunter, Black Heart', which was loosely based on Peter Viertel's 1953 account of his experiences making the film. It's unique for what it is. Overall: I have to say, the film is accurate enough to the source material, and entertaining enough to be a call to adventure of a lifetime for all that watch. So pick it up! It's worth your time. It's a sweet ride.",

Katharine Hepburn plays Rose Sayer, a prim and proper missionary in German East Africa with her brother (Robert Morley) in 1914. Suddenly, right after they receive news that war has broken out in Europe, the German army comes in and demolishes their settlement. After the brother dies, hard-drinking stubbly sailor Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) comes in and agrees to take Rose down the river. Along the way, they bicker about various things (she's disgusted by his drinking, he finds her too pious), but they grow to respect each other.Bogart and Hepburn pretty much play their usual roles, and the movie also stars a few crocodiles (most of the movie was filmed on location in Africa). The portrayal of the German army certainly seems to be an allusion to the Nazis. But overall, the movie is quite admirable, with Rose's and Charlie's personalities bouncing off of each other.

It has a perfect script, two characters who throw sparks off each other, great location work that shows in the photography, and two of the finest performances ever on film--Bogie's gin-slinging boat captain and a prim missionary proving that opposites attract. Both are priceless in their roles--every gesture, every word showing us exactly what their personalities are--and getting every bit of humor out of the script.The story has them meeting after her missionary brother (Robert Morley) has been killed. While aboard his riverboat, she talks him into sinking a German ship (this is pre-World War I) and the rest of the film has them fighting to stay afloat amid the rapids as the boat heads downstream toward the enemy. Bogie's exchanges with her showed that despite everything, he was gradually coming to admire her. He fully deserved the Oscar for this performance. Along with his Captain Queeg in \"The Caine Mutiny\" and his Sam Spade in \"The Maltese Falcon\", this ranks as one of his very best film roles.Adventure, humor and romance--in what must have been a most uncomfortable film for the actors and crew as they trudged through darkest Africa!

            "content": "Term \"overrated\"; it wouldn't be something I would attribute to a film usually as directed by John Huston and starring Humphrey Bogart (co-star Katherine Hepburn is another matter). But overtime this little piece of romantic fluff/saga of war-time daring-do has been called one of the greatest American films ever made. And for those who do love it, more power to them. It is a star vehicle first and foremost- and in 1951 if you were going to have two stars for the majority of the running-time these were the two to get- and die-hard fans can praise it as much as they want. But when it comes down to it, the film hasn't aged as well as one might think, and it goes without saying that what was really on Huston's mind during filming (hunting elephants) probably had something to do with the focus coming off of things like, erm, logic. It is a yarn, to be certain, and under the terms of what is \"light-hearted\" (in quotes because it has some dark undertones) it works out alright. But an all-time classic I think not.For one thing- and I know I would get some arguing over this- the two stars don't really have that much chemistry. It doesn't help matters that clich\u00e9 steers the ship; Bogart and Hepburns' characters, Charlie and Rosie, are going down a river where at first they can't stand one another as one is a drunkard on gin and the other is a prissy go-for-it-all who doesn't really see the consequences, AND whenever Bogie somehow gets the African Queen over some rapids she suddenly starts to fall in love with the guy. I don't buy it- when comparing to something like, say, the real McCoy in Bogie and McCall, it doesn't hold a candle. Hepburn, until maybe the second half when she changes gears only slightly, and depending on the risks in the scene, doesn't alter much in her personality. While it is, in a way, a good performance at playing someone who is shrill and prissy, it doesn't help make one care that much about her.Meanwhile, Bogie is still a pro at what he does (though not Oscar-worthy pro, not up against Brando- the performance that really deserved it was In a Lonely Place, which is sour grapes of course long after the fact). He, and Huston's occasional outbursts of creativity in the simple framework of the script, do make it mildly entertaining; it's a good picture to probably check out on a rainy summer's weekend afternoon with lots of tea (or gin). And there's even a few fascinating bits with the dangers of going down a river in Africa, i.e. the swarming bugs and the leeches as they try and get the boat out of the mud. But by the time of the ending, when the 'what-the-hell' moment happens as the torpedo strikes at the ship at the most unlikely- yet most likely- of moments, I couldn't wait for the recently married to get off the screen. If you haven't seen a film by Huston or with Bogie or Hepburn, look elsewhere to start. If exotic locales and silly romantic river-boat adventure is your game, be my guest.",

            "content": "I can't believe there is any doubt after fifty-five years that \"African Queen\" is one of the greatest romantic/adventure films of all time, and one of Humphrey Bogart's most delightful roles.Some \"classic\" films appear awkward and even amateurish after all this time, due to the stunning advances in film technology over the decades, but \"African Queen\" remains astonishing fresh. I believe this is due to the rugged on-location filming, which is a Hollywood legend in and of itself (Please read Katherine Hepburn's excellent book \"Making of the African Queen\" AND Clint Eastwood's outstanding film 'White Hunter, Black Heart\", for an accurate and detailed look at the goings-on behind the cameras). The realism of the location filming feels as immediate and convincing as if the movie had been filmed this year.Bogart and Katherine Hepburn turn in what must be among the very best performances of their respective careers, as a drunken captain and a prim missionary lady. Perhaps because they are initially not very sympathetic or traditionally \"good looking\" or even young, their courtship is deeply touching. I think that this is one of the most moving screen romances of all time because of this...it's a refreshing change from youth-obsessed Hollywood (then as now) to see 40-somethings in a convincing and deeply romantic love story.My favorite scene remains the one where Charlie and Rosie, exhausted by their travails trying to get the African Queen through a reed-choked section of river, collapse unconscious in the boat, feeling they are doomed for certain death...while a crane shots shows that they have indeed reached the last portion of the reeds, and are gracefully floating into clear waters...what a beautiful metaphor for hope against all odds. This never fails to move me to tears.Surely one of the source inspirations for modern stuff like \"Indiana Jones\", \"African Queen\" has plenty of physical adventure (white water rapids), evil Germans (always reliable baddies, even in WWI), gross out parts (the leeches) and suspense...so that this film seems equally loved by both men and women. It's a grand adventure as well as a sensitive love story. The ending is one of the most deeply satisfying in all of cinema history.That brings me to the source material -- the original novel by C.S. Forrester. Many reviewers comment on this, but I'll bet that very few have READ it. I went to great lengths to order this long out-of-print novel (so short it's almost a novella) from interlibrary loan a few years back. The film is a remarkably faithful adaptation of the book, with ONE glaring obsession. I don't think it's an actual spoiler to remark on this for film history buffs, but I'll still buffer this:\"SPOILER ALERT! (well, sort of)\"In the movie, Rosie and Charlie are married by the German captain and this is one of the satisfying romantic highlights of the film, especially as they ask to marry just before what appears to be their certain execution. However, in the book, it's revealed at the novel's end (which otherwise mostly reflects the film's ending) that Charlie is a womanizer, who has already married (but never divorced) several other women. He's a bigamist, who doesn't take his vows with the least seriousness and will undoubtedly leave Rosie, just as he has the last three wives. Furthermore, due to his bigamy, their \"marriage\" is a sham and certainly invalid.This is the ironic twist that ends the novel, and I can't say I am surprised that Hollywood cleaned it up to present us with the far more conventional (and I have to admit, far more satisfying) ending that exists. However, for film buffs, I think this detail is interesting and well-worth knowing!",

Their only contact with the outside world is one Charlie Alnutt, who runs a small packet ship called The African Queen up the local river. When the Germans declare war and Samuel dies of fever, Rose and Charlie try to take the boat downriver and escape \u0085The African Queen is one of the richest, most entertaining and heartwarming romance pictures ever made. Unlike most love stories, it actually has a credible plot with plenty of action and humour to keep it steaming along. It was also an incredibly original idea for a movie; take two completely different people (and actors) with nothing in common, and slam them into a breathless adventure. This idea has been copied endlessly since, but here it is fresh, funny and memorable, as the God-fearing prim spinster Rose rubs dirty, lazy, laid-back Charlie up all the wrong ways. Hepburn and Bogart are sensational in their only film together (he won an Oscar), her naive sobriety gradually melting into real physical attraction, whilst his never-take-anything-seriously attitude is tested to the limit. The two of them carry the whole movie together, and their relationship is constantly changing and growing; a testament to the power of the characters and performances. The movie is also a technical masterpiece - a large amount of it was shot on location in The Congo and Uganda (unheard of at the time) and it deftly combines exteriors, studio sets, second unit footage and effects shots in a way that is still being used nowadays. The sheer technical challenge of it (whitewater rapids, underwater scenes, mosquitoes, shooting a whole movie on a thirty-foot boat) is something only a director of Huston's chutzpah would dare, and the end result is dazzling. Jack Cardiff's early colour photography is outstanding, and his operator was Ted Moore, who went on to shoot many of the classic James Bond films. Like so many great movies, the film was an independent production, funded by a small British company called Romulus and produced by the legendary Sam Spiegel. Written by Huston and James Agee (with uncredited work by John Collier and Peter Viertel), based on a novel by C.S. Forester (author of the Horatio Hornblower books). For a great movie about the pre-production work on this film and John Huston in general, check out Clint Eastwood's White Hunter Black Heart, adapted from Viertel's account of his work on the film (the production of which, according to most sources, was fairly torturous). I'm not normally a fan of romantic pictures - they always seem so contrived - but this is a definite must-see; two great performances, a great story and a great movie.",

In the process, they must fight for survival along treacherous waters.The gin-guzzling riverboat captain is a great counter to the strait-laced missionary and the two stars make this a ride to remember. Besides the performances, the script probably shines the most. James Agee and John Huston, who also directed, have a great knack for writing crisp and smooth interplay between the two leads.There aren't very many supporting roles in this movie, but Robert Morley makes the best of his small performance. He's actually quite memorable and he hearkens back to supporting players of older Bogart movies like Sidney Greenstreet.Both leads received well deserved Oscar nominations and Humphrey Bogart finally won his big award. That should tell you that I'm not the only one who thought this movie was excellent. If you like stirring action with great chemistry from the stars, then you'll love The African Queen.",

He comes across a missionary team and warns them of the war however the missionary pair stay.  When Rev Sayer dies, Allnut agrees to escort Sayer's sister, Rose, back to the West. However she convinces him to perhaps take on a German ship.  On their journey the two fall for each other before the inevitable conflict.There aren't many films that I could watch easily every Saturday afternoon, but The African Queen I think must be one of them. Of course the plot is very implausible and it isn't the best story in the world but it has a sort of ambling joy to it that makes the film very enjoyable.  The weaknesses in the plot are pretty much all covered by the warm feeling the film gives and this saves it.This warm feeling mainly comes from the easy chemistry that Hepburn and Bogart have.  They compliment each other perfectly.  Bogart won the Oscar, but he really is a bit OTT and hammy.  After years of giving hard boiled low key performances it is a little ironic he got it for this.  Hepburn is very good \u0096 an English rose that falls for Allnut.  Neither is brilliant but together they work really well.  Aside from a few German caricatures, it is all these two and it shows how well they do that the film rarely flags with them onscreen.I don't think this is as much of a classic as people seem to think it is, simply because the plot is unlikely and doesn't quite work.  However the easy chemistry between the stars make it well worth a watch and a definite choice for a nice Saturday afternoon in.",

            "content": "THE AFRICAN_QUEEN is a fine film, starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. Bogart plays a boat mechanic and Hepburn plays a prim and proper English missionary. The vast majority of the movie is just accompanying the two characters on a dangerous trip down an African river, and that suits me just fine.As the characters motor along, they become better acquainted and are forced to depend on each other. Bogart's blue-collar boatman and Hepburn's proper Englishwoman make for an unlikely romantic pairing.This performance won Humphrey Bogart his one and only Academy Award. And deservedly so, as this is perhaps his best acting performance. Bogart plays a dirty, scraggly mechanic. An ordinary Joe. A blue-collar worker. It's a bit of a departure from his famous 1940s roles as sarcastic and clever reluctant heroes. His role in THE AFRICAN_QUEEN is one where an actor can lose himself in the character. It's not Humphrey Bogart wearing a different outfit, it's a small-time boatman in Africa. A man with little interest in global affairs. A man who likes his gin. A man who knows his boat like a good friend, and who can read the river like an open book. A man who will gladly oblige the requests of his higher-class passengers. Bogart's character is just a bit softer and more nuanced, I think, than his roles in, say, CASABLANCA, THE MALTESE FALCON, or THE BIG SLEEP.For the most part, THE AFRICAN_QUEEN follows two characters on their foolhardy adventure down the river. There are no other characters for 95% of the film. So it is important that the two stars can act at the same level. The great Katharine Hepburn provides a screen presence that can balance out Humphrey Bogart's. It's a rare delight to see two titans of the silver screen share almost the entire screen time. And Bogie and Hepburn, playing opposite-type characters, keep each other in check. Neither star outshines the other.The story has to do with World War I repercussions in the African colonies. When the Germans go on the march, Hepburn's missionary escapes with Bogart's boatman. They motor downstream in Bogart's rusty steamer \"The African Queen\", braving all sorts of danger, from rapids to crocodiles to gunfire. The reason for the journey? Hepburn decides it is her patriotic duty to use the explosive cargo on the \"Queen\" to sabotage a German ship.All along the journey, through the hardships, the two sailors need each other. Hepburn learns how to handle the boat and grows to admire Bogart, while Bogart benefits from Hepburn's help and female companionship. As far as the mission goes, one person is always there to spur the other one on when the going gets rough. Each one will do just about anything for the other.John Huston's Technicolor film was shot in part on location in Africa and includes some nice scenery. The movie is pleasant, with some adventure and some romance. It's not heavy or bogged down with political themes or messages. It's not really \"about\" anything. (The human spirit, maybe?) THE AFRICAN_QUEEN is just an enjoyable trip through the African jungle with two of the biggest stars in Hollywood history.",

            "content": "The African Queen was one of a small number of classic films I saw as a child. It was before I had heard of Humphrey Bogart, Katherine Hepburn or the director John Huston, but the romantic adventure story and dazzling imagery really gripped me and seared itself into my memory. Now that I've got to know the picture again as an adult I can appreciate why.This was Huston's lightest and most upbeat film so far, and yet it still contains shadows of his trademark pessimism. Although he generally worked from literary adaptations, Huston was always attracted to these stories about humanity struggling in the face of nature, about broken dreams and failed quests. The flipside to this was that even his gloomiest films seem to celebrate the human spirit soldiering on in the midst of these failures. The African Queen is, in its way, another of these failed quests \u0096 the attack on the Louisa doesn't go exactly as planned, and the Sayers' missionary post becomes a lost cause \u0096 but the strength of humanity, embodied in the hero and heroine, is at the fore.This also happens to be Huston's first feature in colour. Both Huston and his cinematographer Jack Cardiff had studied painting before they came into film, so it is no surprise that the colour compositions are masterful here at a time when many filmmakers were still feeling their way with Technicolor. The Sayers and their home in the opening scenes are picked out in grubby whites. The greens of the jungle are incredibly vibrant. Huston's eye for character placement is also on top form. For him, every shot was like a painting.What I think really makes The African Queen so timeless is the tender ordinariness of the romance that is at its heart. All too often in cinema the love story seems tacked on, and very often the female lead herself is tacked on for the sake of a romantic angle. Here however, both characters are essential to the story, and you feel as if their falling in love is a logical part of their character development. Also the fact that these two characters are totally isolated on the boat frees the love story from any complications of third parties. What I mean is there are no rivals, no comic relief sidekicks egging them on, no confidants for them to discuss their true feelings with \u0096 all we see is the two leads, and their romance unfolds all the more naturally for it.The middle-aged Bogart and Hepburn were also beginning to lose currency as romantic leads at this time. Neither are their characters typical heroes \u0096 one is a tramp, the other a frump. But this in itself is why they are so appealing and so easy to identify with. Not only are the two of them perfectly cast, but The African Queen is possibly a career best for both as well.There really is very little not to like about The African Queen \u0096 it is simply a great story well told.",

The script, acting and direction all worked together to make a movie that deservedly gained notoriety and praise.Is this Katherine Hepburn's best film? Probably. Mostly because not only did she do a great job of acting, but also because despite working in some of the worst conditions imaginable, everyone associated with the film marveled at her cheerful demeanor and professionalism.The film begins in a British colony in Africa at the outbreak of WWI. Despite Katherine Hepburn and her brother (played briefly by Robert Morley) being missionaries, they are rough handled by the Germans and he is killed in the process. Kate, usually quite the lady, is stranded and angry but unable to do anything. When she meets up with a crusty old skipper of a small scow (Bogart), he agrees to help. However, when she insists that instead of taking her to safety that they take on the Germans, he thinks she's crazy.A great script, great direction by John Huston and exceptional acting all work together to make this memorable.

The budding romance between Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart (in his Oscar-winning role) softens the rough-hewn, sweaty scenario, though there is still plenty of action and good, ribbing dialogue. Not particularly well-made, with on-location sequences shuffled together with studio shots, yet the incredible star-power certainly puts it across after a balky opening.

It's surprising though that people can call this movie one of the greatest of all time considering the hokey (and at times unbelievable) script and the awkward lack of chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn. Actually, that lack of chemistry creates some strangely funny moments which change the tone of this adventure story--sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. The two are never really believable as the characters they are playing, but they are still fun to watch as a couple of stars chewing up the scenery. Bogart's Academy Award for this performance is obviously a Revlon choice in that it makes up for his being overlooked for at least 10 better performances that he gave prior to this one. Huston's direction seems to lose focus in the last 10 minutes or so and the ending is very abrupt, but overall the film is briskly paced and painless. Also worth noting is the wonderful use of African locations as photographed by master cinematographer Jack Cardiff. If you want to see a better film with similar themes, check out Huston's far superior Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison.",

It's always at the top of our list and definitely one of those pictures that we routinely view from tome to time. To us it ranks right up there with the likes of CASABLANCA, CITIZEN KANE, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and DONDI. (just kidding about the last one) WITH ITS BEAUTUIFUL, authentic African locales, it is captivating from the very first scenes. Next to TRADER HORN (MGM, 1931), this is perhaps the earliest location shooting that was done in the 'Dark Continent'; and this time it's in true color.WITH THE CAMERA work being done in the Nth degree of perfection, the area of story and production easily matched the quality of the previous category. The novel by C.S. Forrester was adapted by the very capable hands of James Agee; with assistance from Director John Huston, John Collier and Peter Vitrel. The screen story seems to be flawless, moving along without wasting a single scene. Director Huston once again demonstrates his chameleon-like ability to bring us a true variety of great films that all retain singular identities.THE SEEMINGLY UNLIKELY teaming of Kate with Bogie provides us with a super charged dynamic and even sexual tension between two so different people. She being the prim and proper church woman and He being a sort of foulmouthed vulgarian and boozer to boot; theirs is a highly unlikely romance, to say the least.SET IN AN Africa of the Colonial Period, circa 1914-18, the story plays out against a backdrop of hostilities between European Powers set in their variously colored pieces of the Dark Continent's geography.IN ESSENCE, WHAT we have is a sort of Odyssey on the River, with the two people growing in their appreciation and acceptance of the other. Eventually, the two would be an item and spend the rest of their lives together; presumably not in sub-equatorial Africa, but rather back in Merry Olde England.IN THE PROCESS, Bogie sacrifices 'the African Queen'(the ship's name) as a sort of guided missile or torpedo; which is dispatched with an explosive load to destroy a German Man-o-War on the Lake.

It is a fine excellent of film making, focusing on only two characters and sticks to it's narrative course. They is action adventure for men, and a strong romantic storyline for women. Katharine Hepburn offers a good performance, whilst Humphrey Bogart was strong for the most of the time, but he did overact at times. Humphrey Bogart won an Oscar for this performance, but he should have won it for Casablanca. They are good set-pieces, and John Huston show he has skill behind the camera.

            "content": "The African Queen is one of the finest films ever made, and one of my personal favorites.  It is the story of love born between two unlikely human beings amidst intense battles against nature and Ze Germans.  Charlie Allnut (Bogart) and Rose Sayer (Hepburn) have no business ever even speaking to each other under normal circumstances.  He being the gruff, unkempt lush Canadian \"captain\" of a one man ship, The African Queen, and she being the somewhat haughty, prim and proper British sister of a missionary killed by the Germans in Africa in the first World War.  The film is the story of their worlds meeting during a journey towards the destruction of the German's most powerful ship in Africa.What is it that makes this film so great?  It's all Bogart and Hepburn.  Of the roughly 105 minutes of film, it's them and them alone for about 90. Arguably, no two actors have ever solely carried a film this good by themselves.  Both, especially Bogart, lose themselves in the roles completely.  Of immense help was, of course, director John Huston and the decision to go into Africa and not a Hollywood backlot or LA area river to do the filming.  The river and the jungle's harshly real environment made Bogart and Hepburn's performances all the better.  I could praddle on and on about why Bogart and Hepburn are so great in this film, but there are two key moments that sum it all up for me.  Both may seem unordinary overall, but say all that needs to be said about the two characters.  The first is when Rose, who has been calling (Bogart) \"Mr. Allnut\" for as long as she has known him, realizes she doesn't know his first name.  He tells her \"It's Charlie\".  She gets a big smile on her face and repeats \"Charlie...that's a nice name\".  Something about her demeanor when she says that displays, to me, an extraordinary joy and affection, maybe even love, for Charlie that her words perhaps do not.  Later, after Charlie and Rose have successfully navigated some white water rapids that seemed impossible to get through, Charlie grabs Rose, kisses her, and shouts \"Hip Hip Horray!\"  Again, there's something about the way Bogart does it that conveys to me the same joy, affection and love for Rose that she did earlier when repeating his name.\nAgain, these two moments seem relatively insignificant in the context of the whole movie.  But in my opinion, they make the movie.  In this movie, as with most others, it's hard to give a damn about what characters say or do if you don't give a damn about them.  And those moments make me care about these two characters in a way that I ordinarily never would.  I shudder to think what results Bette Davis and David Niven, both fine actors, would have had with this filmThe ending of the film is, of course, implausible.  Without revealing anything, what are the odds of things happening as they did?  But who cares. By the end, we as viewers should and would be ecstatic if Rose and Charlie were simply able to marry before their execution.  The boat ultimately blowing up and both our heroes coming out married and alive is icing on the cake.  The film ends with us knowing that despite what Keanu Reeves says, a relationship between two people who meet under extreme circumstances can work out.   Also, Robert Morley's brief performance as Rose's brother is memorable, as are most all of his performances.  And Bogart scene with the leeches is as horrifying as the same scene in Stand By Me kids is funny.",

These were generally 16mm prints released to the TV studios in B&W. Some of these \"TV Prints\" still survive in collector's hands today.

As audiences love lightweight fluff, it's no surprise that this was Huston's biggest hit. The film brought in so much money that John Ford would try to rip it off with the atrocious \"Mogambo\" (1953), and Huston would himself virtually remake it six years later with \"Heaven Knows, Mr Allison\".Though regarded as a classic by many, the film's dialogue lacks wit, its second unit (and rear screen projection) photography is jarring, several sequences are embarrassing (Bogey and Hepburn impersonating animals, Hepburn titillating us with shots of her underwear etc), and the film's archetypal romance, between an uptight woman and a dirty rascal, has been done to death by countless others films.Of course Bogart is always worth watching, but everything he did here he did better elsewhere. He played a better boat captain in \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"The Caine Mutiny\", he had better romances in \"Casablanca\", \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"The Big Sleep\", and as a rogue who is swayed by a woman toward patriotism and \"joining the fight against Germans\", he was better in \"Casablanca\".Incidentally, Hepburn was a bit of an oddity in real life. A tomboy, the child of activist parents, very intelligent and rumoured to be gay or bisexual, the roles she played typically mirrored her own life. They're well educated characters, aloof, intelligent, confident, modern, sophisticated, share her preference for trousers over skirts (radical at the time), and of course are always distrustful of men. Able to cut men down to size with their brains, shrill voice and razor-sharp wit, Hepburn's characters quickly led to her becoming a feminist icon (and much later, a gay and lesbian icon). Her characters didn't need men, didn't even seem to need sex (indeed they were often sexually frigid) and were almost always fully independent and autonomous. That is, of course, until the final acts of her films. Almost all her characters are eventually beaten down, tamed and subjugated by lowbrow, carnal, earthly men. The most overt examples are perhaps \"The Rainmaker\" and \"The Philadelphia Story\".Hilariously, John Huston didn't much care for \"The African Queen\". He embarked on the project primarily because it allowed him to journey to Africa and shoot elephants (some claim he never shot any). Clint Eastwood's \"White Hunter Black Heart\" is a fictionalised account of Huston's ordeals and adventures whilst making this film.7.5/10 - Worth one viewing.",

I thought it was entertaining and even moving at times.  I could see (retrospectively) how this seminal movie has influenced many of my favorites.  (Dead Man Walking, Stand By Me, Apocalypse Now, etc.)  Oddly, while \"African Queen\" had a strong beginning and ending, it was its incredible MIDDLE that made it such a classic.  It is in its middle sections that \"African Queen\" wins our hearts.  Here we see Rose lose her annoyingly prim composure during a vicious bug attack.  We watch Rose and Charlie's first kiss and see their initially awkward love blossom into something comfortable and natural. And of course my favorite:  the leech scene!  We see the now indomitable Charlie enter the water to drag the Queen through the mud.  Then, before long, we see his utterly believable discomfiture as he and Rose discover that he is covered in leeches. (SNAKES:INDIANA JONES::LEECHES:CHARLIE ALLNUT)  And then, once they've all been salted off...Charlie resigns himself to get back in the water.  Why?  For his new-found love of country, self, and (most significant) Rose.  At least that's what his scared but determined face seems to say.In such scenes, our love for these characters grows as does theirs for each other.  In the face of terror and pain and even specific phobias, the initially annoying personas are stripped away and we see Rose and Charlie in their truest forms: afraid and hurting.  Yet, in spite of their weaknesses, they struggle onward.  In this, they are TRUE HEROES.  They are terrified and discouraged (far from the imperturbable Superman-types) and still they do the impossible (or the unnavigable as the case may be).  These are my kind of heroes!And, while the eleventh hour ending may be a bit far-fetched, we don't mind. These two have earned a victorious ending, however it is delivered!",

            "review_title": "Some flawless performances is a strangely imperfect classic with a bizarre bizarre ending.",
            "content": "African Queen (1951)Humphrey Bogart is his gritty flawless best here--as funny as he gets, and as bitter, tired, and leach covered. That's enough to sustain any movie, and toss in that his friend and fellow manly-man John Huston directed, we have a brutally physical, man-against-nature and man-against-himself film. This is the Bogart of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), where Huston and he again create a character that is as three-dimensional, compelling, repugnant, and cutting as they get. And unlike Treasure, the public and the academy responded well. He won Best Actor in 1952.Katherine Hepburn is another story, and why she was cast for this film I'm not sure (she was chosen before Bogart, and choosing Bogart was her idea). I'll guess it's because she is so physical and fearless, a perfect tomboy in church marm clothes. She overcomes the stiffness of her part by sheer presence, but also, eventually, by her getting tough and dirty, too. She becomes less the preacher's sister and more the pioneer woman caught in the middle of World War I in Africa. She had a rough time during the location shoots, getting sick and losing a lot of weight, so some of her gaunt appearance is not acting one bit.The arrival of the Germans in two main scenes may have seemed necessary in post war American (though a different German-inspired world war). But it enters the movie at first as a curiosity and a necessity, to drive the two characters down the raging river. The second time is near the end, and it turns the movie into a farce. It's the bizarre tone of the ending that throws the movie out of balance. The sudden lighthearted, improbable, and almost goofy turn, so at odds with the rest of the drama (even at odds with the sincerely funny humor earlier on), makes you wonder, after it's over, whether the whole movie was meant to be a kind of excessive satire. If so, I missed it, and might need to see it again to read it differently.But taking it as a high adventure where two unlikely people are stuck having to depend on each other to survive, the movie still stutters. The wildlife shots (from the bow, supposedly) make it a Discover Channel safari at times. The home brew fix-it scenes are interesting but scarcely believable (he welds a metal prop for his boat with a charcoal fire on the beach, for starters). And the key scenes, the second most famous (after the leach scene, which is pretty amazing), are the running the rapids. This occurs several different times, and we have a mixture of actual shots, backscreen shots, and faked shots using a scale model in a studio in England, the boat and stiff dummies shooting down the water unguided and with a fast motion peculiarity. It's almost comical, and I took it as \"the best they could do\" for the time, and didn't let it bother me.Now, after the end, I'm wondering if they (Huston et al) never really wanted believability to be an issue. It is more a fable, an entertainment. Yet it seems hard to reconcile with the hype and the extremes required to shoot it. African Queen does have two of the most legendary actors of their time, and it takes location shooting to a new height, and it is a spectacular idea. I didn't know what to think by the end. Was I disappointed? Yes. Was I glad to have seen it? Absolutely. Now that it's finally out on DVD in the U.S. (and Blu-Ray, both very high quality), you should see it, too.",

The initial antipathy that gradually resolves into mutual respect and affection thru the course of their trial by fire is entirely believable, very funny, and often painful (for the characters, not the viewer).This is a must see classic for all fans of great cinema, and is a sterling example of how two top notch actors can hold the stage and your rapt attention virtually by themselves for an entire movie.",

            "review_title": "The lavish sense of adventure and both fascinating and intrinsic in equal measure character study, sees Huston's African Queen sit upon its throne with aplomb.",
            "content": "John Huston's The African Queen is built around an enthralling relationship between two central characters of binary opposition whom eventually come to understand and follow both one another's thinking and lifestyle. The film is a fantastic picture, a superior character study and a gripping adventure through the hostile territories of a jungle by way of a river boat and into the unknown. Huston seamlessly encompasses an odd aura of our characters just drifting, or stuck, in this hostile, frightening, nightmarish zone as predominant genres of both romance and adventure are ably supported by that of the war genre along with a sense of it being a singular stranded journey in which the characters will get very few second chances at what they attempt. There's a sense of hopelessness in the film, beautifully masked hopelessness which is achieved by the strong leads with set positions on a range of items primed to clash and envelop. In short, it is one of the better films of both this era and of this ilk that you will, perhaps, ever see.The film unfolds in 1914, just as The First World War breaks out, and takes place in a large territory on the continent of Africa known as German East Africa which has since gone on to be broken up into a number of other nations. Katharine Hepburn's Rose Sayer runs a small parish with her brother Sam (Morley) within the confines of this stretch of jungled land, frequent visits from Humphrey Bogart's American mailman Charlie Allnut and a lot of both studying and singing of Christianity with her Reverend brother plus the congregators seemingly the norm. Tragedy strikes and The War arrives at their church in the form of native, black soldiers under the command of the German army whom burn and destroy everything, including the local village, within the vicinity; these enemies of freedom and Christianity destroying most of the world the Sayer's inhabit, so much so that Sam passes away through the grief and shock of it all.Here begins a tale of romance, self discovery and conflict with one another; nature around them and the larger element of the German war machine - something which is enthralling on several levels. In appearance, Rose is prim and formal; her similarities to Charlie the well-oiled, greasy, steamboat dwelling delivery boy whom chugs up and down the river initially fleeting. She partakes in a session of singing Christian tunes within the confines of her church that, like her brother, sees her struggle to instigate much positivity within the presence of the black locals charged with joining in. On Charlie's boat, and where the aforementioned brother/sister pairing lack the charisma to be at one with the predominant settlers of their locale, the mailman is at ease with a coloured gentleman as they laugh and talk in a relaxed manner and in one that suggests at-ease. It is the first few examples of both the to-be central characters standing in stark opposition to one another, a sense Huston puts across that neither of them will ever really connect with one another and thus the film cannot possibly revolve around them and thus, has to come to focus on something else prior to the catalyst event. Perhaps the film will be about Charlie on his boat all by himself. Maybe it will even revolve around the trials and tribulations of Rose and her brother trying to take their parish from the, apparently uninspiring settlement it is, to something more meaningful to the locals.The torching of the village acts as Rose's point of no return, her forced coming together with Charlie on board his boat as she escapes away with him seeing ideologies and lifestyles immediately clash. While Charlie himself verbally identifies Rose as a \"doer\", he himself lives by the philosophy that you \"needn't do what you can put off until tomorrow\". Rose is smarting from her brother's death and wants revenge on the Germans by later targeting a warship of their's further down the river whereas Charlie is much more of a pacifist; the two of them even share binary oppositional traits in what it is they prefer to drink in that prim, formal Englishwoman Rose would much rather have tea than Charlie's informal American mailman gin. The key scene, as each of them share this toing and froing as the war and dense jungle force them to occupy this small space of the steam boat, comes when Charlie simultaneously casts off Rose's quaint bonnet hat and lands a kiss onto her as they manage to avoid almost certain destruction at the hands of a German fort down the river. The removing of the bonnet furthers Rose's own arc, a sense that she is seeing more of the native land she inhabits and developing more whilst on this boat than she ever did hosting uncharismatic and fleeting sessions of Christianity preaching at the old church, just as it effectively plants seeds of love within the text.The film is much more than a sporadic series of events that play out down a river and that could unfold in any order you wish. There's a sense of depth of proceedings; that sense of two characters constantly facing new obstacles and feeling fresh emotions towards both their situation and one another. Huston brings the jungle surrounding them alive by having the noises it omits contribute to the text in that monkeys screech when Charlie is hungover and elephants roar when characters are angry at one another. Aided by the late Jack Cardiff's cinematography and some sublime direction, The African Queen is a wondrous adaptation of the C. S. Forester novel; a film which begins and ends with the harsh realities of war and going on to detail that hate and destruction furthers feelings of hate and destruction, in between focusing on a nourishing relationship between two people coming to share the polar opposites.",

            "content": "I can't imagine anybody not enjoying a thrilling romantic adventure like 'The African Queen (1951).' Though it may not pack the emotional punch of 'The Treasure of Sierra Madre (1948)' or 'Moby Dick (1956),' this is nonetheless John Huston at his most entertaining, thanks largely to the impeccable chemistry between two of Hollywood's all-time most charismatic stars. In 1914, as the outbreak of WWI disturbs even the remote depths of wild Africa, Humphrey Bogart \u0096 grizzled, gruff and coarse \u0096 must form a tentative alliance with prim and proper British spinster Katharine Hepburn, if they are to triumph over the evil forces of Germany. With only the vague objective of somehow sinking the feared German warship, the Louisa, the two near-strangers strike out downriver in Bogart's small but resilient steam-powered supply boat, the African Queen. A continual bombardment of jungle obstacles, both natural and human, frequently threaten their survival, but the more prevailing question is whether or not the two polar-opposites will be able to survive each other!John Huston's rousing adventure was largely filmed on location in Africa, though many of the white-water sequences were obviously shot before a rear-projection screen in London; fortunately, these optical effects are far less distracting on a cinema screen. It can often be problematic to build almost an entire film around just two characters, but Bogart and Hepburn are clearly up to the challenge, sharing a chemistry that is infectiously entertaining. Whether they're engaged in awkwardly-formal conversation, at each other's throats, or falling in love, every line of dialogue (from a screenplay by John Huston and James Agee) is an absolute delight, all the more so because we know that Charlie and Rose will eventually end up in each other's arms. At either end of the adventure, Robert Morley lends some pathos to the tale as Rose's humble missionary brother, who dies following a German raid; and Peter Bull, though perhaps too cartoonish to entirely fit the film's overall tone, adds some lighthearted humour as a temperamental enemy captain.Just what is it about 'The African Queen' that has made it such an enormous viewer favourite? I think that much of this has to do with Huston's predominantly lighthearted approach to the material \u0096 if you're not gripping your seat in excitement, then you're laughing at the interactions between the two leads. However, there's also a less-pronounced political commentary at play. Reverend Sayer's death might been viewed as symbolising the inevitable death of British Colonialism. That Bogart's roguish, hard-drinking North American (he's actually a Canadian) effectively conquers the prudishness of Hepburn's formal British spinster may likewise be taken to foreshadow the United States' rise as the world's most influential superpower. All politics aside, I find it amusing that just last week I attended a cinema screening of Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now (1979),' in which an intrepid team of soldiers venture into the darkness upriver. Just consider 'The African Queen' as that film's polar opposite \u0096 for this time we're going downriver, and we're gonna have a rollicking good time.",

The two of them eventually get involved in planning to destroy a German gunboat and their early tension soon (inevitably) evolves into love. This film is a classic adventure and it should've won the Best Picture Academy Award for 1951. However, it wasn't even nominated and that is a real insult.

Ride the rapids, go over a waterfall, suffer the slings and arrows of the German fort at Shona, get half eaten by clouds of flying gnats, be leeched by slimy critters as you haul the boat by hand through mephitic swamps, half die from fever, come within an inch of being hanged by Theodore Bikel and Peter (\"I think I shall hang you twice\") Bull aboard the German riverboat -- and have more fun doing it than you could have imagined.It's not all action. There is a tentative and touching romance developed between Humphrey Bogart as the skipper of the decrepit launch and Katherine Hepburn as the skinny, psalm-singing old maid who convinces him that the Louisa, the German gunboat, must be sunk with improvised torpedoes.Hepburn is a tough babe in this movie, tougher than Bogart. She stoically endures the death of her missionary brother, Robert Morley, at the hands of the marauding Germans when the First World War begins. Instead of being frightened by the rapids, she's thrilled by them. And she pushes the common-sensical Bogart to heights of inspiration, strength, and heroism.There's a delicate love story under all the adventures, far more effective than that in, say, \"Casablanca.\" The mismatched couple find each other through compromise and by forming a superordinate goal -- the sinking of the Louisa. Until then, Hepburn seemed content to live out her life with her brother in an attempt to convert \"the natives\" who could scarcely care less. And Bogart was perfectly satisfied being his own boss, a wastrel whose most carefully planned thought never reached beyond tomorrow. Bogart gives the role everything he's got -- and that's a lot. He cultivates not another variation on his familiar screen persona but a genuine portrait of a character that already seems familiar to us but which we've never associated with Bogart before. He's always been a dapper urbanite, but here we see him chuckling gleefully as he kicks the temperamental engine on his boat. Drunk, he brings up his \"poor old mother\" and is about to weep. One of his best scenes has him at tea with Morley and Hepburn, uncomfortable with all that politesse and distracted by his gastric motility. Morley reads the newspaper and announces that a rival of his has just been promoted to Bishop. Bogart jumps in his chair, startled, and says, \"Huh\"? Then his belly begins curmuring -- audibly. \"Have some more tea, Mister Allnut,\" says Hepburn, doing her best to ignore the borborygmus. It's much funnier than Eddy Murphy's family all ventilating their bowels at the dinner table in \"The Nutty Professor.\" See it at once or be hanged twice.",

Once again she shows her off talent in being able to balance the comedy elements with the melodrama - a performance also worthy of an oscar.

You won't find the gloss i.e. nice spanking new costumes and perfect facial complexions here.I for one became attached to the duo's journey - who can forget the episode with the leeches, the sheer disgust and fear on Bogie's face when he first realises the critters are on him, and the slow realisation he has to go back into the water to get the boat moving. Masterful acting it really is, and surprising coming from him.Forget the comments by whats his name \"Bsinc\" - even though all opinions must be respected, just go back to watching Titanic or Romeo Must Die or whatever it is you watch.

Making that achievement even more noteworthy is the fact that the film itself wasn't nominated for Best Picture, somewhat puzzling in my view. Throughout the movie, Bogey's inspired to an entire new range of facial expressions not limited to the familiar pursing of his lips seen in virtually every single one of his other films. He appears most anguished in an amusing scene having tea with Reverend Sayer (Robert Morley) and his sister Rose (Katherine Hepburn). As Mr. Allnut's (Bogart) stomach grumbles incessantly, the good reverend finds a page in the newspaper advertising 'Pace Windcock's Wind Pills'!Never were two individuals more disparate than gin swilling machinist Charlie Allnut and the spinsterish Rosey Sayer, but it's that hurdle that the film manages to overcome as the pair find themselves growing closer to each other through raging river rapids, German gunfire and leech infested waters. At first, Rosey's suggestion that they blow up a hundred ton steamship with home made torpedoes is completely derided by Allnut, but as time passes, the impossible seems more and more doable. The victory kiss between the two following the conquest of the rapids cements a new dynamic between them, and all of a sudden it's a different movie, a romantic adventure.Originally written as a serious film, no one was more surprised than director John Huston at how effectively funny Bogart and Hepburn were together. Though Hepburn was genuinely disturbed by the amount of drinking between the two men on the set, it didn't affect the end product, as wry humor managed to alter the movie's overall tone. The actors look like they're having just the grandest time as Bogey does a mean hippo imitation alternating with chattering chimpanzee antics. I think the gin might have been having an effect by that time.I still prefer some of Bogart's earlier films, \"Casablanca\" is my all time favorite. Even so, the greatness of \"The African Queen\" can't be denied, featuring as it does the contenders for greatest male and female actors in history. And who can't identify with the pronouncement of the Louisa's first officer as he marries the seemingly doomed couple - \"By the authority vested in me..., I pronounce you man and wife.

I think this is due to the fact that this movie never manages to find its right balance. At times the movie is being adventurous, at other comical or action-like, or romantic. But its never really fully one thing. The movie changes style a lot, even with its own comedy. At times it's a screwball, while at others its being more of a modern type of comedy. Perhaps this is due to the fact that this movie got made in 1951, when the screwball type of comedies weren't really around anymore and movies tried to find a new, more modern, type of comedy, for the new modern audience. When watching this movie you really have the feeling it could had been a great one, if it had made a choice at what it truly wanted to be. If it had been a screwball comedy the movie would probably had ended up being an hilarious one, if it had been more an adventurous movie, lets say Indiana Jones style, this movie would had been truly fun. Now it's just a bit of everything, without ever forming one great, successful, big whole. It's the reason why the movie still feels a bit clumsy and definitely flawed.But nevertheless, there of course is still plenty of fun in this movie. It's a good movie to watch to be entertained by, just don't expect to be blown away by any cleverness or originality, or even greatness for all that matter.It has the right concept and story for this type of movie. Basically movies like this are still being around today, in which two people, who don't even like each other at first, due to circumstances end up together and start to grow toward each other. A classic movie set up, which makes it perhaps also strange that this movie hasn't got remade yet. I'm not counting the 1977 version with the same title, since its being more of a sequel and was supposed to be a pilot for a TV-series that got picked up by any studios.Because the movie got shot in the early '50's but in full color, the movie has a sort of cheap look over it, even though this at the time was a very expensive movie to shoot. It's just one of those movies that would probably had been better off being shot in black & white. Besides, Humphrey Bogart never looked at his best in color. It was both for him and Katharine Hepburn the first time they appeared in a Technicolor film. It will also be remembered as the movie that earned Humphrey Bogart his first and only Oscar. Totally ridicules of course, since he had played so many, much better roles throughout his career. But at least he still won an Oscar during his career. Not every great actor out of cinematic history can say that very same.But before I'm sounding too negative I should say that you probably won't regret watching this movie. It's a fun classic, that however could had been much, much better.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "I had caught the end of this film before but somehow had never watched it all the way through so when I saw it listed in the TV guide I had to watch it; now, having seen it, I can see why it is considered a classic. The film opens in 1914 in German East Africa, present day Tanzania, where an English missionary and his sister are taking a church service. They are interrupted by the steam boat 'African Queen' and her captain Charlie Allnut. He informs them of the war that has broken out in Europe and as such they are stranded in an enemy country. It isn't long before the Germans turn up and burn down the village; they leave the missionaries but the affect leaves the preacher a broken man and he soon dies. When Allnut returns he takes the sister, Rosie Sayer, aboard his boat and sets off down river. He suggests they find an island and sit the war out but she has other ideas... she wants to continue down river, past a German fort, over deadly rapids and on to the lake. This lake is patrolled by the German ship the Queen Louisa which is the only thing keeping British forces from attacking the German colony. She intends to take their small boat and sink the Louisa! I really enjoyed this film; Bogart was great as the gin-swilling steamer captain and Katherine Hepburn was equally good as the prim sister of the preacher; the two of them had a great on screen chemistry. Director John Huston did a fine job creating an exciting story; I was surprised just how good some of the special effects looked; it really looked like their small boat was being tossed around in the rapids even though a model was used... it helped of course that much of the movie was filmed on location in Africa; the scenery looked real because it was! While at heart the film is a romantic story between the two very different characters I couldn't help thinking about the film 'Apocalypse Now' as the boat went further and further along the river getting into various scrapes and approaching the deadly conclusion to its mission... this film is of course much lighter in tone! That isn't to say there isn't tension and more than once it looks as if the two protagonists are going to die before completing their self-given mission. If you want a good adventure that is suitable for all ages you could do a lot worse than this... I highly recommend it.",

Certain scenes are overplayed, most notably when Charlie (Humphrey Bogart) and Rose (Katharine Hepburn) are arguing over who should take the boat to blow up the \"Louisa\" and the climax which relies too much on coincidence. Also, there is some rather obvious back projection when \"The African Queen\" is going down rapids. But, for all this, it still remains an enjoyable movie. Huston coaxes memorable performances from Bogart and Hepburn and there is some great cinematography by Jack Cardiff. It certainly a film that deserves to be remembered, and its the sort of film that you put your feet up to on a wet Sunday afternoon.",

In WWI Africa , a Bible-thumping spinster Rose Sayer(Hepburn) tries hard to turn the other cheek when her missionary brother is killed. A hard drinking riverboat captain Charlie Allnut(Bogart)offers the strait-laced lady what he thinks is the safest passage down an African river. Captain Charlie is as rustic as Rose is prim and proper. Along the slow cruise, Rose persuades Allnut to destroy a German gunboat. The two battle aquatic obstacles and themselves. The riverboat will end up needing some repair and before long the unlikely couple find affection for each other. Also featured: Robert Morley, Theodore Bikel and Peter Bull.

            "content": "Charlie (Bogart) says that he never does today what he can put off until tomorrow. That attitude probably explains the condition of his river boat. What a dirty old tub it is and the engine so rusty he has to regularly kick the pipes to dislodge the rust, otherwise the pipes could clog up and the boiler explode. But Charlie is not over fussy. With a supply of wood for the boiler and a case of gin for himself, he manages to keep going up and down the river on his African Queen.It's a pretty tall story when you come to think of it....a rough neck like Charlie falling in love with Rose a prim and very staid Methodist missionary (Katherine Hepburn). But in a way that's the charm of the film. Two lost souls enduring every hardship together and finding strength in each other's companionship.What surprises me is Rose's remarkable suggestions on repairing a bent propeller shaft and broken blade with little more than a campfire and a hammer. And as for creating a couple of torpedoes from some gas cylinders filled with sticks of dynamite and what not, it beggars belief. But what fun it is to see all this come together ( just like in a boy's adventure book) and we wait expectantly for the German ship Louisa to be scuttled.I could not understand how leeches were prevalent in one part of the river and not further down stream and how dozens of crocodiles slithering into the water did not deter them from wading in the water later on. But it had to be like that because it was just a series of adventures...ever-changing...and danger at every turn of the river.I have to admire the performances of Bogart and Hepburn who were on the screen virtually all the time. I especially enjoyed watching Katherine Hepburn...a truly superb actress.I thought the ending of the film left much to be desired. It was not the same quality cinema as in the rest of this outstanding film. Who was steering the Louisa and why did he not see the Afrian Queen? As for the exuberant married couple bursting into song while in a half-drowned state, it was a bit hard to take but at least it ensured a happy ending after so many near-death experiences.",

John Wayne followed, never playing anything but himself. And so is the case with our Miss Kate. She delivers her lines with conviction, but it is always her conviction, not the character's.(A clue: she never acts with her body, only her mouth and the tilt of her head. Even that tilt was normally restricted in the studio films as she insisted in a downward lighting to emphasize her cheeks.)I like to watch this every once in a while to remind myself how forgiving we are. A film can be severely flawed; dialog and normal dramatic practice can be compromised, but if there is one strong element -- only one is required -- we forgive all and happily join.The strong element here is the characterization of the two of course. Neither was an actor of particularly wide range or depth. Each had established themselves, their lives, in the public's mind -- screen and real persons merged.Reading her memoir of this movie, you can just see her on screen behaving not so much as her character (which is very poorly portrayed in the scenes with her brother) but as herself. It is a sort of documentary around which someone has arranged a story, after the fashion of \"What's up Tiger-Lily.\"So it boils down to whether you think these people are interesting, as people.

The church service is then interrupted when a small boat known as \"the African Queen\" arrives. After exchanging pleasantries with both Samuel and Rose, the riverboat captain \"Charlie Allnut\" (Humphrey Bogart) informs them that the British are at war with Germany and he then gets back in his boat to venture down the river. Not long after that, to the complete dismay of both Samuel and Rose, a German army detachment arrives and destroys both the church and the small village. A day or two later Reverend Sayer dies of an injury sustained during the attack which leaves Rose all alone in a completely burned down and abandoned village. To her surprise, Charlie arrives not long afterward and realizing that she has nowhere else to go offers to take her to safety on his boat. Although Rose talks about personally entering the war against the Germans, what Charlie doesn't realize is just how serious she is-and she plans to use the African Queen to do just that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining movie which featured good performances by both Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn along with some beautiful scenery as the African Queen navigates the river. As a matter of fact, Humphrey Bogart won an Academy Award for his performance and Katherine Hepburn was also nominated as well. And while I didn't care that much for the rather awkward chemistry between the two of them, the movie itself was still entertaining in its own right and for that reason I have rated it accordingly.

            "review_title": "Missed opportunity: poor script makes for an uneven, overly-simplistic, uninteresting river-boat ride.",
            "content": "(major spoilers - if you're a fan, do not read!)The atmosphere is hot and wet, the music is obvious radio-style highlighting of the plot, the subject matter is handled with the subtlety of a broom-handle by brash director Huston, but most of all, the script needed heavy-duty rewrites.It is impossibly uneven: having only seen clips from the movie before, i'd always thought the thing that drew people to it was how such totally different people as the old ship's captain and the reserved school-teacher could get together - but this most interesting aspect of the story was not well developed at all. Her transition takes place by far too quickly. Within the space of ten minutes, instead of what it should have been, a gradual progression from school-marm to ship's captain's wife throughout the film, she goes from getting onto the boat for the first time and kissing Bogart for the first time. So we can throw this out the window as a point of interest for the story: and its loss is felt deeply: from this moment on, the script fishes around for a purpose, for narrative drive: it dabbles in rapids, leaches, waterfalls, and sentimental moments of \"i love you and you love me and there's no conflict,\" which go nowhere, but most pretentious of all was how Huston pulls a fast one on us by trying to suggest that these two would involve themselves in the war, which is going on off-screen, however small their intended input may have been, by fashioning some torpedoes out of reeds and saw-dust and cutting some holes in the bow of the African Queen to lay them in (never mind how they were supposed to have shot out of these holes...).In the 90's people used to make jokes about how MacGyver used to be able to fashion a parachute out of some matchsticks, or an aeroplane out of an old shoe and some shaving cream. Macyver thus became a metaphor for the ridiculous situations filmmakers sometimes ask us to believe people could get out of. I can't see why audiences in the 50's didn't feel the same way about African Queen. Charlie and Rose \"weld\" a propeller back together using a campfire and a billower, they make a torpeedo god knows how (Bogey explains it, but he says it very quickly, in hopes the audience won't listen), they repair a massive hole in the bottom of the boat and fix the mast by similar impossibilities. There is a technical name for these kinds of cop-outs, and its \"deus ex machina\": usually it only refers to when a new character or event is introduced to rescue the protagonists from some situation they could not have plausibly escaped from. But these kinds of implausible ways the characters get out of situations in this movie are very similar. You may have heard this term in Donnie Darko (towards the end), and in Adaptation (Robert McKee warns against using it). Huston cops out and uses one in the end of African Queen, as well as the various other big fish he expects us to swallow throughout.Huston should have realized the more interesting aspect of the story was not the political one, the anti-war sentiments, it was not the down-stream adventure either - it was, or should have been, the relationship between Charlie and Rose. This is indeed what has drawn people to it across the years, but if you look back at it, its really the part of the movie that is copped out on. Look at Pride and Prejudice by comparison: Mr Darcy and Elizabeth spend the entire book/movie/mini-series despising each other, and only in the last five minutes/pages do they give in. By contrast, Charlie and Rose only TAKE five minutes to give in! Huston's interests lay elsewhere: he clearly was not interested in romance, and so got the two of them together as quick as he could bear, so they could begin to lie in each others arms and call each other dear and proceed to have a couple of adventures, which fill out the rest of the film.No, this is not one of the greatest pictures ever made. It wasn't even the greatest picture in 1951: see Streetcar Named Desire and An American in Paris for that honour, or any of the movies on my profile for better movies of all time. It had the potential to be great, but it was too poorly written. Bogey and Hepburn are good in this - Hepburn especially (when Bogey acted, it was great, and not how he was in real life, but it was always that same fast-talking, wise-cracking persona, not much different here than in The Big Sleep and the Maltese Falcon, i'm sorry to say. It was a crying shame that the Academy decided to award the Best Actor of the year to Bogey, in honour of a phenomenal career, instead of to Brando, for a phenomenal performance). There are sweet moments (though they quickly turn to sap), there are great scenes, but these are not enough to make a great movie. Kurosawa once said that even a great director can not make a good movie out of a poor script, and this is what Huston has baned himself with in African Queen. The characters, so loved and praised by many, end up being more two-dimensional than they could have been, due to the simplistic story. At the moment when they kiss, they immediately become boring, because they're just like every other lovey-dovey romantic leads of the period, calling each other dear, willing to go anywhere with each other, beyond the bounds of normal reason, considering they only just met! And all of a sudden there is nothing more complex going on under the surface than a bumpy ride down the river. It tells a simple story, but unfortunately the story was too simple to retain my interest. 3 out of 5.",

I never did I want to see Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn leave that tiny broken down old boat in an African rain forest - The African Queen is the film I measure all \"man and woman who hate each other at the start but gradually fall in love\" movies against. With the power of these actors, this transition comes off completely organically without a contrivance insight - even the point at which they fall in love can be pinpointed to an exact moment.In showing how he was one of the most adaptable actors in cinema, Bogart leaves his usual urban dwellings and into the African jungle in the role of Charlie Allnut - the scruffy, carefree canuck of whom the recently commenced Great War in Europe means nothing to him nor does he appear to grasp its importance. It's not until Rose (Katharine Hepburn) awakens a patriotic duty out of him does he perform his part to take out the German army. The scene in which Bogart goofs around with his intimation of various animals is surely the silliest moment of his career, but it's all good fun - although I do have to ask am I the only one who gets some Bugs Bunny vibes with his performance here?Katharine Hepburn's Rose is one tough dame and does not appear to be a very likeable character during the first portion of the film. She doesn't treat Charlie with any respect because he won't agree with her demands, takes him granted and is interfering with what ain't her property! But she's Kate, she can do whatever she wants and get away with it, and we still love her for it (or at least that's the case with me). Ultimately she makes more of a gentleman out of the scruffy, alcoholic slob - showing behind every great man is a great woman. Hepburn often played roles tailored towards her oddball personality, so I wonder if she held any hesitation portraying a Christian missionary and a more conservative, prudish woman (the film even features a recreation of the Walls of Jericho from It Happened One Night).Jack Cardiff's Technicolor cinematography has such striking vibrancy, a style distinctive from Hollywood Technicolor and one which captures Bogart and Hepburn's rough, beat-up faces (devoid of any make-up) in such detail. Along with the sound effects of nature in the background and the occasional bit of wildlife, The African Queen is as close as a movie can get to make me feel like I'm a riverboat in East Africa. The African Queen was one of my earliest exposures to classic cinema, aeons before these movies took over my life and although I only saw the remaining 40 minutes, it stuck with me. In particular, the scene in which our duo starts getting eaten by insects; that scene always gives me the heebie-jeebies (even if it's not a great special effect). The African Queen is within that rare category of films in which every viewing feels like a unique viewing experience, no matter how many times I watch it.",

Both are in great form in what must have been very physically exacting roles and even if I didn't fully swallow their romance, I decided early on to go with the flow, much like the old \"African Queen\" herself.John Huston keeps a sure hand on the tiller, moving the story from episode to episode with little time for reflection until the big finale, which is just about the right approach. Of course it helps that he has the great Jack Cardiff behind the camera who only a few years earlier was filming \"Scott of The Antarctic\" in a completely different climate to the steamy jungle here.All told, holes in the plot apart, the film is great fun to watch and with such a heavyweight team behind and in front of the camera, it really couldn't fail.",

Hepburn played a strong willed missionary named Rose Sayer who was somewhat an annoying character early on but I thought effectively fell into place as a character you applauded at just the right time in the movie. Anyone who has seen Hepburn in \"True Grit\" will realize she is playing pretty close to the same character which could have been a negative but in both cases (Being \"True Grit\" and \"The African Queen\") the combined talent of actors easily overpowered the problem.The lone flaw that was obvious in the movie was the fact that a vast majority of the filming appeared to be filmed in studio with fake backgrounds. Of course it was standard practice at that time but given the clarity and visuals we are use to in this modern day and age it does stand out more than it would of even just ten years ago. I guess the reason it stands out so much in \"The African Queen\" is the adventure aspect itself was a very visual thing with the river rolling by behind the camera and many subtle actions in the background. I watched the movie on VHS because at the time of this review there isn't a good US release or a widescreen release. Which of course I question why it isn't cleaned up and released.",

Nearly the entire movie consists of the interactions of this most improbable couple in 1914 cooped up on a steam-powered boat built around 1885.But the modern viewer would more likely recognize the script's potential, for what we have here is a prototype of the Indiana Jones quests, which included a chance pairing with an improbable female, travel that required overcoming insurmountable obstacles, natural and man-made, and a seemingly impossible goal. Add to that excitement and just the right dose of humor and romance, not taking yourself too seriously, but not going over the top into farce. If Steven Spielberg didn't deliberately use The African Queen as a model, I'll eat my hat. Heck, Harrison Ford would seem the best modern actor to fill Bogart's shoes in a remake because you can imagine him as an unshaven sop who cleans up into a hero and lover. But can anyone match Bogart's and Hepburn's acting? This is 90 percent of the picture's greatness. The movie's charm is the personal transformation of the two characters: the reserved, repressed missionary into a thrill-seeking military tactician and romantic lover; and the lazy, louche Bogart brought into line by the woman he needs to give him strength. Neither has a great deal of confidence in themselves at the start, especially in romance, yet all this changes by the seemingly impossible conclusion. So the adventure quest is also a personal, spiritual quest, not unlike the Indy films.The adventure/spiritual quest of course predates Indy and Hollywood, going back to Ancient Greece, so it is an immortal formula, if done right. We see a variation in Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and an element even in North by Northwest. If done wrong, if the formula is misused, the result can be preposterous, like Rooster Cogburn, a pointless, pathetic attempt to exploit the success of The African Queen by pairing Hepburn with an aging John Wayne. In African Queen, Hepburn's most potent weapon against Bogie is to refuse to talk to him; in Rooster, Hepburn bludgeons the Duke into submission by chattering him into near insanity with one of the worst scripts every written. It is the sheer improbability of the plot that makes the story so delicious. One reviewer here said, you expect me to believe this? Well, yes and no. This is Hollywood, so it's not supposed to be entirely reality based. A movie creates an alternate universe with certain rules and assumptions, and if it is good, it is internally consistent, but at odds with reality, which is what you want to escape from. Hepburn sets down the challenge early on: Blow up the Louisa. The secondary implied challenge is to do this without Bogie and Kate tearing each other's eyes out. Since Hepburn is a righteous Christian, the movie allows for a certain amount of divine intervention. The movie carries you along, step by step, without unduly straining your credulity, if you accept the divine grace part. The other fascination for viewers must have been deepest Africa, which was a much more mysterious unknown 60 years ago. If the movie had not been shot on location, it would have been only a shadow of itself.So, would you have spotted the future greatness of The African Queen in 1951? Bogart, along with Casablanca, would not achieve cult status until the Sixties. Sam Spiegel's masterpieces were in the future: On the Waterfront, Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia. Residuals from TV, VHS, DVDs were inconceivable. What you were left with was a movie that was likely to be very good, like countless other movies, fun to watch, that would do well at the box office and then disappear. But, shooting on location in Africa with all its unknowns, it could also be a disaster that might never be completed. Shooting The African Queen was a gamble, like its plot, but one that paid off beyond anyone's imagining.",

Welcome to reality...Films used to be shot on a medium called \"Film\". Actors spoke their lines and they were recorded live on tape. Films were literally cut with a razor blade.If you aren't prepared to make some allowances for the 1952 date on the film, go away and watch some cgi marvel that doesn't \"need\" actors. Look at the latest Starwars movie - all cgi, no quality.Yes, the green screen background is visible in many scenes, but it isn't an impediment to enjoying the movie.Yes, the boat going down the rapids is a model, with stuffed dummies nailed to the tiller.Yes, the social niceties of 1952 seem quaint from our perspective, but they were real then - as real as the leeches - The *way* in which the characters work out their personal issues are part of the magic of the movie. By modern standards it's quaint, but back then it was revolutionary.Never forget this in film reviews - many great films of their era are now outpaced by later copies with more action and less style(rip-offs?). The best films are the most copied and in a strange way the earliest to date - but they come back in style.That said, I agree that Bogie didn't win the Oscar for *this film* but for his *previous* work that had not been adequately rewarded at the time (Maltese Falcon anyone?). Awards are like this. They're partial and they lag reality...I agree that Bogie and Hepburn fall together too fast, but at the time it was almost verboten to hint at a night of passion the way this film does. The film was a landmark. We can never go back to how things were in the past, and before this film. Similarly, by breaking so many rules and moulds, this film may have contemned itself to a non-appreciative future with a new generation who don't understand that there was a \"before\".Before this film, it had never been done. Once this film did it, nobody could appreciate that one would not do it this way.Bogie and Hepburn were marvelous here. Watch it just for them...",

That is especially thanks to Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. 2 actors who dominated the theaters at that time, and in their only film together do a fantastic job at making us truly believe the spark between the characters.Much like most of the other reviewers, I cant help but mention how impressive this film looks for a 1951 movie. Even though at times you can clearly see the outlines for green-screen like effects, it still is vastly beautiful film. Its a wonder why it didn't get nominated for more awards at the Oscars. Even heading to the latter half of the peak of her career, Katharine Hepburn has never looked more beautiful. I'm also impressed at the actors willingness to do this movie, as it is partially filmed in Africa. You cant help but think at that point in Hollywood, almost every movie was shot in California or New York. It's good to see a classic film take on an entirely different location.So from award worthy performances and directing to the astounding cinematography, this film deserves a place among the great Hollywood achievements in film.8.2/10",

            "content": "In their only co-starring effort, Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are glorious in this technicolor production of C.S. Forester's novel  directed by John Huston.  When there is a tribal uprising in the Belgian Congo and missionary Rose Sayer's (Hepburn) brother (played by Robert Morley) is killed, she enlists the aid of dipsomaniac Charles Allnut (Bogart) to help get her to safety by way of his boat, The African Queen.  Unused to each others' ways of living (while she is prim and proper, he is foul-mouthed and lethargic), they are forced to battle the tides, rapids and each other. After many strong-willed shouting matches, the mismatched pair soon discover that they are falling in love with each other, but even that dosen't stop them from going head-to-head during the various stages of their journey. Scene for scene, this film only grows better with age, due to the undeniable chemistry between the two leads (Bogart won the Best Actor Oscar; Hepburn was nominated Best Actress) and Huston's magnificent direction, which also netted an Oscar nomination.  Kudos to James Agee (who later wrote the screenplay for The Night of the Hunter) for his wonderful script and Jack Cardiff for his vivid cinematography.  A brilliant chronicle of the neverending battle of the sexes. ****",

            "content": "A prim and proper missionary and a grizzled drunken sea captain take on the Nazi's in this brilliant adventure that should NEVER be re-made. Leave excellence alone, probably the greatest movie NOT to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. What a shame, because so many Best Picture nominees and a few winners can't even compare to this excellence that this features. In their only appearance together, real-life friends Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart share an undeniable chemistry that can't be denied. She's opposed to his crass persona. He thinks of her as a skinny old maid. But physical attraction isn't everything, and their shared experience in going down the rough rapid-filled river brings them together through the most necessary of human experience: survival.The personality of director John Huston is felt deeply in this, his most personal of films, documented through the many bios of the people involved, including Bogart's real-life wife, Lauren Bacall who accompanied the cast and crew and establishing an equally close friendship with Hepburn whom she obviously adored. Robert Morley is touching in his brief role as Hepburn's fragile brother, while Theodore Bikel is commanding, yet sympathetic and very un-Nazi like as the German officer who captures Bogart and Hepburn during the last stages of their mission.There are so many memorable sequences here, from Hepburn, Morley and Bogart's oh-so-polite tear party, the invasion on the mission by the Nazi's, Hepburn and Bogart's various fights (especially after she pours out his booze), the strength which Hepburn must find during their flight down the rapids, and her reaction to it once it is over. Humorously, the scene where Bogart discovers he's covered in leeches becomes both funny and touching as Hepburn must pull them off of him. The photography is definitely influenced by the British cinematographers, utilizing different filters and techniques to make it look very different than American films, comparable to the photography of such British classics as \"Black Narcissus\" and \"Caesar and Cleopatra\".",

            "review_title": "Top 10 reasons why I just have to rate the African Queen in the top 100 of ALL TIME film classics",
            "content": "1. Humphrey Bogart who plays a gin-swigging steamboat captain named Charlie Allnut. *Need I also mention that Bogie won his one and only Oscar for best actor for his performance? 2. Katherine Hepburn as the stubborn and over the top straight-laced missionary named Rose Sayer who is given no choice but to have to rely on the drunkard captain Charlie Allnut for her passage on his steamboat appropriately named the African Queen. 3. Robert Morley has a brief but important role playing Rose's brother the righteous Reverend Samuel Sayer. Samuel is not only Rose's Missionary brother but also her rock of Gibraltar. When these two Missionaries are advised by Charlie (who is delivering them some supplies) to leave their post as war is upon them, they decide to stay on and preach rather than fear for their own lives as the Germans are evading Africa during World War 1. Sadly, Reverend Samuel Sayer quickly succumbs to a high fever and now Rose is on her own in the heart of Africa at the outbreak of war with no passage arranged for her return home. 4. This is a story that encompasses great adventure, plenty of action, a generous supply of wonderful comedy between Hepburn and Bogart, and of course a true romance blossoming on the African Queen. 5. Opposites do attract and this could not be truer than with the polar opposites of Missionary Rose Sayer, and steamboat captain, gin-swigging Charlie Allnut, who eventually find a way to not only become good friends, but who also bring out the best and worst in each other and eventually they fall in love. 6. The adventure takes place as the two sail down the Ulanga River with Rose persisting that Charlie fear not and use his precious African Queen steamboat as a torpedo to take out the German's artillery ship the K\u00f6nigin Luise. 7. Rose and Charlie are both feisty characters and a case of gin that Charlie has stashed on his boat brings out the best and the worst of their feistiness in both a comical and dramatic way for different reasons. I just loved the interactions between these two hard boiled characters who must find a way to get along if they actually want to survive their trip down the Ulanga River. 8. The action takes place as Rose and Charlie must not only get through the fierce rapids of the Ulanga river, not once, not twice, but three times, but they must also find a way to survive the attack of the Germans who are piercing Charlie's steamboat with bullets. 9. After surviving the drunkenness of Charlie's worst hangover, and the deliberate spillage by Rose of Charlie's most precious cargo (his gin), the Ulanga river rapids, the German's attack on their steamboat, the African Queen is left barely limping by the end of the film. Rose and Charlie are oh so close to not only surviving their ordeals, but succeeding in beating the Germans at their own game and they find themselves in an embarrassing but still loving embrace that will have most romantics letting out a big sigh of relief and wonderment. These are the scenes which epitomize the term \"film classic\".10. Although the majority of this film relies solely on the superb acting and great chemistry between Katherine Hepburn, and Oscar winner Humphrey Bogart, much praise has to also be extolled on to director John Huston who kept his two stars sympatico during the sweltering heat and bug infested waters of filming each day. The reward is there on the big screen for all to see, a classic film that will never fade from the top 100 classic films of all time. I just love this film and I hope anyone who has not seen it takes the time to enjoy one of the greatest films of all times.A Perfect 10 for 10 rating",

            "content": "\"The African Queen\" is a classic, not because of the chemistry of its stars or the pretty pictures, but because unlike many similar stories of this nature, it is about something: Salvation.The movie begins when a church service held in a remote african village by Rev. Sayer and his sister is interrupted by Charlie Allnut, a comic variation on the theme of existentialist heroes so familiar to both Bogart and director John Huston's work.While the africans can be redeemed simply by exposure, Allnut is beyond the Sayer's reach: He is unredeemable, belching and gurgling his way through high tea. Minutes after he leaves, the village is burned to the ground by German.  The reverend is dead. He is not physically killed by the Germans: He loses his mind, and then drops dead.Allnut returns to rescue Rose and they begin their journey down the river together. Hundreds of incompatible couples have been sent on journeys down roads and rivers by thousands of screewriters, but in most cases their differences are invented and phoney, and the resolving of their differences comes only because the people making the movie knew it had to be that way. In \"The African Queen\" it is organic and it is noble. With her brother and her village gone, rose has only one soul left to save: That of Charlie Allnut. And he is a legitimate challenge to her, a true lost soul, not some derivative character played by Harrison Ford.In the course of their journey they don't bicker and fall in love, they have a profound impact on each other. Allnut loosens Rosie up, and turns her into a \"woman\". Rosie reforms Allnut, and turns him into a man, ultimately inspiring him to become a hero by attempting the impossible: an attack on the German boat at the lake the river empties into. Their plans go awry and they are caputured and sentenced to death. Before being hanged, they ask the German Captain to marry them. Like the church service athe beginning, the marriage ceremony at the end of the movie is  interupted: not by Mr. Allnut, but instead by the \"African Queen\" herself, now outfitted as a floating bomb, crashing into the German boat.Huston returned to the idea of putting a bunch of people in a tight spot together many times: \"The Treasure Of Sierra Madre\", \"Key Largo\", \"We Were Strangers\", \"Beat The Devil\", \"Heaven Knows Mr. Allison\" being a few examples. In some cases the purposes were noble, in others they were most certainly not. In this case it is the act of falling in love and in doing so, inspiring each other to greatness.  \"The African Queen\" is no \"Treasure Of Sierra Madre\", but that's one of the 10 great movies ever, this is just a great movie.",

            "content": "Film studies coursework aside, one can tell the elasticity of a film by watching it again (over five decades later) and if it can continue to stretch, it has beaten through the space/film continuum. Was it enjoyed as much the first time as it was the 100th time? These are great questions to ponder as you watch another round of \"Breathless\", \"Brief Encounter\", or even \"Grand Illusion\" for the millionth time. Time, like age, can either be a blessing for films or a curse. \"The African Queen\" is a difficult one to pinpoint. On one hand it stars giants like Bogart and Hepburn direction by John Ford, while on the other hand it suffers from serious plot holes, sinking character development, and some over-burdening outside connections. There is power behind the working forces of \"The African Queen\", but they need to soon realize that the elastic is pulled to the point of no return, without releasing a DVD soon \u0096 they will a broken film with time not on its side.If one asked who the five most important characters were in \"The African Queen\", it would be simple. They would be Hepburn, Bogart, Africa, Germany, and finally the boat itself (side note \u0096 none of these are in any symbolic order). These are all of the elements that we, as the viewer, are asked to be involved with throughout the course of the 104 minutes. Bogart is easy, on the eyes, ears, and soul. He embodied the surly captain with no care in the world. He was funny, captivating, and in control of every scene he was involved. Hepburn was a good counter-balance, but not that powerful of a character. She was weak when she was meant to be strong, insulting when kind, panicked when excited, and obviously had never been down rapids before in her life. Bogart had the swagger, Hepburn had the cue-cards and patented voice. They had chemistry, but more like a high school romance than a heated cinematic one. Bogart deserved the Oscar. They were great to watch on-screen, even as goofy as I thought Hepburn was, the pacing of the film and their dialogue kept me in motion. I loved what 50s cinema tried when doing a destination shoot. Africa was brought to the masses \u0096 in pre-production format. Campy cinematography deterred the faithful viewer away from the story because plastic mosquitoes and leeches were an eye-sore. It must have been amazing at the time to see Africa in its glory, now it seems forced and overwhelming. Then, let's not forget, the Germans. What good 50s film doesn't enjoy a good frolic in a wooded area without those pesky Germans lurking about? They were hams \u0096 all of them, but they brought a beginning, center, and end climax to this claustrophobic film. Finally, there was the African Queen herself, an aging professional that had more stories to tell than Ford would allow. It may save the day, bring a couple closer together, or even be a drinking buddy. Either way, these are the characters that create \"The African Queen\", whether you like them or not, they are with you throughout the journey.As mentioned, the acting is bearable. The cinematography will definitely need a strong re-vamp when transferred to a DVD. The story itself keeps you seatbelted to your seat for the 104 minutes \u0085 than why do I find myself so unfocused about my thoughts with this classic. Finicky with the characters , what juggles my mind with this film more of the overall platter than just one part of the serving. I didn't connect with the character, that's obvious, the story was fun \u0096 but at the same time seemed very dated and overwhelming. In one scene Bogart is afraid of the rapids, in the next leeches, in the next mosquitoes, but is never afraid to sleep outside without shelter. What can be irritating is that Africa really isn't all that frightening in this film, for being the major antagonist; I needed dark and seedy nights followed by blistering hot days with unbearable living conditions. Hepburn sweat, Bogart drank \u0096 that was about it. The boat itself was actually the scariest part of the film because of the cramp living area. While it did feel like the \"African Queen\" grew and shrunk between scenes, there was this sense of claustrophobia that couldn't be replicated in other films. There was tension, confusion, and panic on this boat, as well there should be, but it needed to be heightened. The terror level needed to go up one more notch \u0096 Bogey wasn't duct taping his windows.Overall, \"The African Queen\" is a classic. There is never a reason to argue against that. It is a classic, however, that is slowly deteriorating over time. The sets are aged, the special effects are \"MST3K\"-able, and the acting (albeit fun) seemed cheap by the end. Set upon the background of the bestselling book by the same title, this is one of those that one should probably read prior to watching. Descriptions could mean life or death, and only the printed page will give us a true sense of emotion. I think I will add this film to my collection when it comes out, I could watch it again \u0096 but not side by side. Bogey is the character that steals the show, while Africa \u0096 in all its glory \u0096 seems to be short changed in the long run. Symbolically this film will be taught in film classes until the end of time, but for me, it seems to be loosing steam around each bend. A classic yes, but will it remain that way?

If this was a 300 horse power Chris Craft cabin cruiser going down the river, maybe the movie wouldn't have been so good, or maybe it would have been.

There's sense of adventure and survival, and even that of a vacation, punctuated with romance.All these ingredients makes this movie a fantastic movie to watch, and every time I see it it makes me feel the same way it did when I saw it as a kid.

I doubt that I'll ever be fortunate enough to see a pairing of main characters as good as this ever again. If I were making a list of 100 must see films of all time , this would make the cut without second thought as the time spent on board the \"African Queen\" is a ride to cherish and if you haven't seen it yet, you simply must.",

            "content": "I completely understand the reviewer that wrote \"Did I miss something\", because that's what I feel about this movie. To see that it even made it to the top 250 movies is even more ridiculous that this supposedly romantic movie itself. The acting by Katharine Hepburn is bad, her make up artist being worse(c'mon, the woman looks 15 years older than Bogie), but leaving the relationship between the two as the worst. I know that a lot has changed in the man/woman relationship over the past century, but when exactly did guys regain their pride and ba..s? I'm talking about the scene where on the first night on the \"Queen\" it starts raining and poor old Bogie, left sleeping in the rain, tries to take shelter where Hepburn is sleeping. She gets p***ed off and says:\"What are you doing?\" or something like that. MAN OH MAN, I get p***ed off just by remembering this scene because it's SOOOOO irritating. The woman is on HIS boat, because HE had the courtesy of saving her life(if he had known what a drag she'd turn up to be, I bet he wouldn't give it a seconds thought) when zee Germans burnt the village, and what does she do, SHE actually has the nerves to kick HIM out of HIS shelter despite the heavy rain. What the f..k? I'm sorry, but I refuse to believe any man would take this crap. I'd have thrown her Skeletor ass overboard the second she'd even start considering doing this. Seriously, the guy gets treated worse than George from Seinfeld, and that's saying a lot! And later on he gets drunk (hmmmm, go figure why he does that), in a moment of weakness(truth, if you ask me)explains to her that she's an utterly obnoxious and controlling person, which for some reason gets to her, and as soon as he falls asleep she's at it again. Picture waking up with a big hangover and the first thing you see is the most annoying person you've ever met in your life. Not pretty, right, well that person is destroying you property. Hepburn decided she had enough of Bogie (remember, she's still alive and kicking because of him) so she pours all of his booze into the river. And I'm not talking about a single bottle, NOOOOO SIR, she unloads the whole case. Everything!!! I can't really remember what happens next, my mind just went blank, probably because of the hatred I felt. Go figure. Anyways, these were just some bright moments from the developing romance between the two actors. The rest of the film relies completely on the dialogue between the two, because the exact story is told in the first two minutes the woman gets on board the \"African Queen\". And what a plan she delivers, you have to see it to believe it, but I'll spare you with this one. Well, the corny dialogues fail completely, but we are left with the decades funniest moment when Bogie imitates a hippo. Another golden moment emerges when Bogie has to fix the propeller and gets naked. He's one skinny man and that's when it hit me that his character is probably supposed to be a slave of some sort. Under fed, with no dignity, wears the same clothes all the time, and even has to drag the ship on foot all by himself. There's actually a scene where he's dragging \"The African Queen\"(Hepburn is doing nothing helpful of course) and then you see the winning close up of his face. That was the Oscar winner for sure (NOT!), who'd let a white guy go through so much. And this movie actually got nominated for a bunch of Oscars, and Bogie even won one. He's not bad, but that's it, and if not bad wins an Oscar I can only imagine how many Bruce Willis should have gotten. Shows what they know, the should-have-given-an-Oscar-to-Kubrick-for-at-least-two-movies. (not counting the special effects one) This just might be the longest review I've ever written and the reason why I'm in such a sarcastic mood lies in the opening page of this movie, the user rating to be precise! I thought \"Casablanca\" was overrated, but this is just ridiculous. 5/10",

Bogart, a coward in hero's clothing, is at times very funny. He deservedly won an Oscar for his unlikeliest role. The clever script is by Huston and the great James Agee.

If it was made (or rebooted, please don't) today, i'm afraid it would be. That is simply not true with the African Queen. Both characters are incredibly complex and relatable. Hepburn is pious and tenacious, but also reckless. Bogart is rough around the edges and seems uneducated, but incredibly gentle and self-sacrificing. Their relationship grows throughout this movie in a way I've never seen before.The one thing that I appreciated most about this love story, is that they fell in love near the beginning. The rest of the film focuses on their sacrifices they make for each other, and the ways they complete each other. I've never seen a film SHOW without telling that these two people could not have accomplished what they did without each other. Inspiring for me in my marriage, and full of beautiful moments.

            "content": "The reputation of this deserved classic rests primarily on the shoulders of master director John Huston and his two legendary stars, Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. The story itself, penned by Huston and James Agee (with uncredited help from Peter Viertel) based on a novel by C.S. Forester, is a two-character high adventure that moves its narrative in a rather contrived manner. Yet, the resulting 1951 film sparkles in a burnished aura of Hollywood lore, as Clint Eastwood saw fit to make a film about the production itself with 1990's \"White Hunter, Black Heart\" and Hepburn herself wrote an entertaining memoir 36 years after the fact with the seemingly apt title, \"The Making of the African Queen: Or How I Went to Africa With Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind\". Between Bogart's apparent boozing, Huston's big game obsessions, Hepburn's idiosyncrasies and the challenging African jungle, it must have been quite an unpredictable set.Set at the outbreak of WWI in 1914 German East Africa when there was an unabated frenzy to colonize and convert the native Africans, the story focuses on Rose Sayer, the prim sister of a missionary who just died from fever and dementia after the Germans invaded and destroyed the village in which they were living and holding mass. To escape the pending return of the Germans, she joins Charlie Allnut, the boozy steamship captain who runs supplies - including torpedo shells and the makings of explosives - along the Ulanga-Bora River. She concocts an ambitious plot to use the explosives aboard Charlie's boat, The African Queen, as a means to destroy the powerful German gunboat, the Louisa, which rules the large lake at the end of the river. Charlie reluctantly agrees, and their perilous journey takes up the bulk of the film. Even though the ending is a bit far-fetched, it doesn't matter much by that point since the characters have so completely ingratiated themselves with the viewer.What makes the film memorable is how the characters evolve from lonely souls who have given up all hope for happiness in their lives to the heroic defenders of the British Empire whose mutual patriotic dedication turns to love. Lesser actors would have been defeated by the sharp corners of the sometimes incredulous plot turns, especially Rose's lightning-quick turnaround on Charlie's charms, but Bogart and Hepburn are so completely in their element that the contrivances actually become part of the allure of the movie. Both have given more accomplished performances in their careers, but neither has appeared more winning than they do here. A Huston favorite, Robert Morley has a few effective moments at the beginning as Rose's reverend brother Samuel, and toward the end, Peter Bull brings appropriate Teutonic bluster as the captain of the Louisa.Obviously inspired by the real-life locations he uses in the Congo and Uganda, Huston directs the proceedings with passion, and he brings genuine excitement to scenes such as their conquest of the rapids and Charlie's dredging of the boat through the mud. More importantly, he allows the two stars ample room to generate the chemistry that has made this such an enduring classic. Jack Cardiff's cinematography is appropriately evocative for the first color film by either star (or for the director for that matter), though some of the later scenes, especially the storm sequence, feel comparatively claustrophobic given that they were obviously shot inside a studio tank in London. A true must-see among Hollywood classics.",

But that's exactly what happens with \"The African Queen.\" Bogart stepped way out of his usual screen persona to play this comical, grizzled character; Hepburn launched the phase of her career that would find her playing uptight spinsters. I never would have thought they'd have any chemistry together, let alone produce even the palest of sexual sparks, but they're as natural a screen pair as either of them was separately with their respective frequent film partners. This adventure romance finds Hepburn's straight-laced missionary and Bogart's unkempt river-boat captain winding their way through the African wilderness. They do all the things you would expect them to do in a movie like this, but what they do best is bicker, down to the very last scene, where their bickering continues even as they are rescued and the final credits roll. According to film annals, Huston hadn't set out to make a comedy, but when he realized how much chemistry his two stars had, he changed gears and made a different movie than was originally intended. Thank God for that -- I'm not a big fan of Huston or his heavy-handed touch as a director, so I'm glad Bogart and Hepburn forced him to lighten up.Grade: A",

However, if the king is not wearing any clothes we have to say something, right? Well, besides Bogart and Hepburn the performances of other actors are bad, sometimes laughably bad. Hepburn's brother in the film simply bugs his eyes out over and over to convey his shock. As one would expect the special effects aren't very special over 60 years ago, which I don't hold against an old film but it is something you notice.I'll give the film some extra credit: it filmed on location (Africa) when it was widely unheard of to do so. It also had to deal with the Nazi hearings in Hollywood, both Bogart and Hepburn participated in the hearings. So there is an interesting back drop and obstacles to overcome. Worth a watch!",

With two great stars and a great director (all of them surely ranking among the giants of the industry) you know that you're going to get a wonderful movie - and so you do. \"The African Queen\" is probably not the best piece of work by any of the three, but putting them together definitely creates a formula for success.Bogart is Charlie Allnut, the Canadian captain of the riverboat African Queen and Hepburn is Rosie, sister of an English missionary. As World War I breaks out, the pair find themselves in enemy territory - German East Africa - with only the bare possibility of escape: they have to pilot the boat down a hazardous river and into a large river separating German East Africa from British East Africa. The problem is that the lake is guarded by a powerful German gunboat that Charlie and Rosie plan to sink by turning the African Queen into a torpedo.It's a fine movie, a solid dramatic adventure with good use of humour scattered throughout as Charlie and Rosie develop their relationship with each other. I appreciated that the romance was between a pair of mature characters. Had the movie been made today Hollywood would probably cast a couple of beautiful but lightweight 20-something's in the lead roles. Bogart and Hepburn on the other hand brought the appropriate gravitas to the roles even while portraying an entirely believable romance. Meanwhile, director Huston makes good use of the movie's African setting, with some truly wonderful wildlife shots and as the end approaches there's real suspense about what's going to happen to these two.

Considering all the production trouble this film went through it's really amazing that any type of good movie was able to come out of it but in the end Huston managed to make a great movie and Bogart delivers one of his greatest performances. I think there are a few campy moments including the overly dramatic music score being used when the German's first attack the camp but outside of this the movie is pretty much flawless and moves lightening fast. The locations and the two stars are what really keeps this film moving. The scenes of the jungles, the wildlife and the river are all excellently captured and it really gives you a sense of being in Africa and not just on some backlot set. Bogart and Hepburn are both terrific in their roles and this brings the most fun in the film. There's always a debate on Bogart winning the Oscar here since it was the same year Brando changed history with A Streecar Named Desire. I think Brando's performance is better but that's not to take anything away from Bogart who actually delivers a performance without any of that Bogart persona attached. It's really incredible how Bogart created this character and didn't really resort to anything we've seen from him in the past. His scenes of courage are played unlike before. His scenes of romance are played unlike before. This is certainly a brilliant performance all around. Hepburn isn't as impressive but still delivers a great performance and the way she makes her character the complete opposite of Bogart is a lot of fun and the two make us believe their relationship towards the end.

My impression is that the premise of this film would have seemed sensible only after World War II. But before? Would a woman who dedicated her life to converting nonbeliever to Christianity be so ripe and ready to abandon the commandment \u00a8Thou shalt not kill\u00a8? It seems especially bizarre given Rose\u00b4s abject revulsion at the very thought of anyone drinking alcohol. So it is worse to drink than it is to kill? What? And then there is the loss of her virginity after years of celibacy. Seems a bit implausible as well, given her background. But maybe in the midst of such a death-defying adventure, love was inevitable between the only two human beings on the boat.Setting aside the nagging questions, there are a few worthwhile scenes throughout and even though the cinematography is quite dated (you can see the overlaying on display everywhere), I am glad that I finally got around to watching this.",

Unexpected relationships must be formed in order to ensure survival, and such a tale was made to be shown from John Huston's lens.Brother and sister, Reverend Samuel (Robert Morley) and Miss Rose Sayer (Katharine Hepburn) are missionaries from Britain currently in Africa. When a passive boat captain Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) shares with the Reverend and his bossy, sure-of-herself sister that war has broken out involving Britain, they become instantly fearful realizing they are now in hostile territory. Charlie, who spends most of his time sailing and drinking, is disinterested and is unaware of what this news means. Charlie is very different from the missionaries and the two don't care for him too much, making things all the more interesting when Rose becomes dependent upon Charlie for her very survival. Charlie and Rose must escape the ravaged country, and their only option is to use Charlie's dilapidated boat The African Queen. They don't just have to be wary of the Germans who are infiltrating Africa but they also have to be wary of the dangers of the river. What may be most difficult to overcome is the extreme differences between the two. They have vastly different ideas on how to achieve their mission and have incredibly different ways on how to spend their downtime. Rose likes to take care of business and read while drinking tea, Charlie likes to drink his days away sailing mindlessly on his boat. Sharing a 30 ft. boat and enduring life-threatening situations, the two eventually become endeared to each other and embrace the need to protect each other. The pair eventually realizes that they are all they have, and they wouldn't have it any other way.Well, hello Bogie, in glorious technicolor! I had forgotten since my last viewing that The African Queen was shot in technicolor, so seeing that was a nice surprise, although black and white Bogie is just as fun, if not more so. There seemed to be a nice homage to the famous Frank Capra film of 1934, It Happened One Night. The great scene in which they take a bath in separate sections of the water leading to the two returning to the boat with Rose insisting that Charlie looks away while she enters the boat. When she is dressing and preparing for bed, Rose puts up a sheet reminiscent of Claudette Colbert creating the divide in the bedroom between she and Clark Gable shared in It Happened One Night. Whether or not this was intentional, it appears as a fun homage. Hepburn and Bogart shared amazing chemistry. As their relationship deepened, it was fun to see the effects they had on each other as their personalities changed. During the scene in which they discover that Charlie's body is covered in leeches, it is clear that the two have developed profound feelings towards each other and they do not merely tolerate each other like they once did, but that they feel deeply towards each other.The \"Humphrey Bogart eyes\" moment in The African Queen came after the proper British Christian missionary dumps the rough and tumble unkempt Charlie's gin into the water. After he gets over his drunkenness and realizes that Rose is angry at him for his behavior and overindulgence, Charlie begins to adapt to Rose's sensibilities. Charlie shaves clean the boat and does his best to impress and work back to the good side of Rose. Charlie is doing his absolute best and still being ignored by Rose. This scene speaks volumes, to me, because it shows just how much the two have grown dependent upon each other. In very different ways, they have lived lonely lives and having someone with them sharing the day-to-day is something they both have grown accustomed to. The desperation on his face is a feat only Bogie could master gifting audiences with the most wonderful \"Humphrey Bogart eyes\" moment in the film. The African Queen is a wonderful display of chemistry between two cinematic greats, by the master John Huston, resulting in a complete joy of a film for audiences everywhere.",

            "content": "The African Queen is a fantastically told story of a gin-swilling riverboat captain and an uptight Methodist missionary. When the movie begins, we are told that the First World War is about to begin. Two Methodist missionaries, a brother and sister, are forced to deal with the German forces that invade the village at which they teach, as it is a British colony. The confrontation ends up killing the brother, leaving his sister, Rose, played marvelously by the always enjoyable Katharine Hepburn, to fend for herself. She takes in with a riverboat captain, played by the immensely talented Humphrey Bogart, named Charlie, who captains the smallish steamship, the African Queen. Their journey takes them down the Ulanga River in Africa. At the beginning of their journey, Rose devises a plan to retaliate against the Germans, for her country, and also to avenge her brother's death. Initially hesitant, Charlie agrees. They decide to turn the boat into a torpedo of sorts and destroy the German gunboat, the Queen Louisa, which is effectively blocking British forces. It is at this point in the film that their respective journeys begin.As the uncouth Charlie and the prim and proper Rose first embark, they are essentially night and day in comparison to one another. Bogart and Hepburn both turn in career performances in their rendition of this odd couple. Rose's strong will and unrelenting attitude convinces, Charlie, who didn't want to get involved in the first place, thinking her plan was suicide. The two actors do a fantastic job of keeping the audience's attention, as it is just the two on screen for a large majority of the movie. As the pair travel down the river, they first gain a begrudging respect for one another. As they traverse and survive the dangerous Ulanga River, that respect slowly starts blossoming into love. While Charlie had been traveling that river for years, he never noticed the natural beauty until he found himself falling for Rose. The pair also grow as individuals, with Charlie becoming more mature and Rose shedding a little of her inhibition. John Huston does a wonderful crafting this story. He gets the best out of his actors and knows how to work with pace and timing. He does a great job of leading us down the path of their relationship without it feeling forced or campy, as happens in so many films today. He masterfully crafts a certain mood to the film; silly, dramatic, and high tension, all at appropriate moments. When the pair is trudging through the marsh, for example, you feel a real sense of doom and despair, as if they might not get out alive.This film just goes to show the incredible talents of the actors and director. Every moment felt genuine and authentic. This film certainly deserves its place in cinematic history as a classic.8/10",

You're gonna tell me this guy lets her command him to go down rapids, past a German fort, over a waterfall, and then rig his boat with torpedoes he somehow has to build to try to blow up a German boat? And on top of that, he puts up with her pouring out all his gin along the way? What?The film lacks any real feeling of menace and has a Disney like feeling to it, despite what should have been scary and desperately harsh conditions. And on top of that he's able to do a little impromptu blacksmithing, and weld his propeller back together?Bogie and Kate have zero chemistry. Maybe less than zero.The awful, jaunty soundtrack. I guess it goes with the tone the film took, but I hate the tone.The fact that they were on-location sounds amazing and much is made of the conditions that the cast and crew were under, but to me it's mostly wasted. The insertion of what looks like stock footage of animals along the shore is silly. The cinematography could have been so much better given the location.The depiction of colonialism and the natives early on.",

            "content": "\"The African Queen\" is a 1951 adventure film directed by John Huston starring Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn.\n\u26aa\nAll in all, the penultimate collaboration between John Huston and Humphrey Bogart chugs down the river as majestically as it conceptualises its romantic adventure, and while the engine runs on a low level and is a little monotonous in the beginning, it gradually increases its steam and gathers a lot of pace, and thanks to superb leading performances by Bogart and Hepburn as the unlikely pair, their genuinely developing chemistry, as well as Huston's straightforward direction, it becomes an atmospheric, extremely authentic yet totally unambiguous journey through the wilderness of Africa and the hearts of humans.\n\u26aa\n#ItsAHumphreyBogartChristmas comes to an end with what happens to be the penultimate collaboration between Bogie and Huston (the last major production, however), and this time, as it has been the case many times before, the director adapted yet another novel. The book of the same name by author C.S. Forester is the basis of this adventure film, and as it turns out, it is yet another great premise: In nineteen-hundred-fourteen, an English missionary and a riverboat captain try to escape from German territory in Africa, as the war in Europe turned them into enemies, and they film follos their endeavour, that also includes wanting to blow up the main ship that lays at anchor. Sounds kind of crazy? Well, to a certain degree it is, but I got to say, before the story reaches the more intense waters, it bops up and down for a while. In the beginning, we are introduced to Captain Charlie Allnutt (as always, charmingly portrayed by Bogie) and the missionary Rose Sayer (elegantly played by Katherine Hepburn). Eventually, the film somehow manages to live from their chemistry, and the development of it is amazingly well paced, but in the first half it takes an almost painfully long time before it reaches this state. There isn't really much happening, it is as varied as, well, cruising down a calm river. They fight verbally, cast the anchor, then go on and repeat this procedure. Honestly, for a while I thought that it was going to be yet another classic I was going to end up disliking, but fortunately, there was some major development going on in the second half of the film. From thrilling white water rapids sequences, over dangerous encounters with German soldiers to exhausting wading through shallow undergrowth, there is surprisingly much variation, and the final act on the German ship is the glorious peak of the action. However, before it reaches this climax, the two main characters unexpectedly fall in love and become an unlikely couple. I mean, one is a strait-laced missionary, and the other is an uncouth and scruffy riverboat captain? How is that supposed to be realistic? The answer: if your leading actors are Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn. Since both are legendary and capable artists for a reason, they make this development look like the most natural thing. Together, they grow on each other, overcome all sorts of obstacles, and passionately rely on their better half, and honestly, despite developing rather quickly, it was effective and touched me a lot. To be honest, in some sort of way, they reminded me of Bonnie and Clyde. Of course, not in the way that they commit crimes together and escape from the police, but in the manner how they are embarking on a journey that is doomed to fail from the start. Like, they try to build torpedoes to blow up a majestic, German flagship while they are on a thirty feet riverboat that would sink after being slightly hit. To them, it doesn't matter, and hence they execute this suicide mission, nevertheless. In a territory controlled by the Germans, where British are executed, what are the odds to survive, anyway? Like this, they enjoy what they think are their last hours on earth, observe the beautiful flora and fauna of Africa (that is wonderfully captured, by the way) and get closer to their certain doom. However, in the end, they indeed manage to succeed in their undertaking (well, by coincidence rather than by plan) and the film ends with a happy ending, after implying that it would end totally different. In the end, this adventure film is a decent experience and a must-watch for every Bogart fan. With this role, he finally won the well-deserved Academy Award (even though there were roles that should have been awarded way earlier) and made one of his last great films. The cinematography, the Technicolor as well as the practical effects are marvellous, and even if the film is rather straightforward and unambiguous, and hence doesn't displayed the brilliant twistedness the director's films usually radiate, it is a phenomenally crafted piece of film, nonetheless.",

Starring opposite him was Katharine Hepburn as a missionary in \"German East Africa.\" I have no idea what \"German East Africa\" is, but that's what the text on the screen read. I suppose in 1914, the time period of this movie, Germans laid claim to east Africa while other Europeans busied themselves with other parts of Africa.Rose Sayer (Hepburn) and Charlie Allnut (Bogart) were thrust together on the African Queen when the Germans attacked her mission. Charlie's plan was to wait out the war until things were normal again while Rose wanted to attack a German ship called the Louisa. It was a suicide mission in which they could be killed any number of ways and a mission you wouldn't expect a church woman to conjure up. Naturally, Charlie thought the idea was crazy, but Rose was able to talk him into it anyway.Over the next few days or more the two went from adversaries to lovers as they braved the weather, the water, and weapons. As I said, I'm not a fan of Hepburn's acting style in the least and this movie was a heavy helping of just her and Bogart.Free on Freevee.",

            "content": "On the brink of WWI, a missionary, Robert Morley, and his sister, Katharine Hepburn, are working in the African Congo. When Germans occupy the territory and Robert is killed, Kate has no choice but to join the scruffy, far-from-pious Humphrey Bogart on his small riverboat \"The African Queen\", since it's their only means of transportation. From then on, it's basically a two-person show as the two navigate through the Congo and come up with a plan to join the war effort.While the initial cast choice was Bette Davis and David Niven, the on screen couple Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen is indelible in audiences' minds. It's impossible to imagine anyone else in the film, even though I absolutely love The Niv and the character was originally written to have a Cockney accent. Humphrey Bogart, playing a Canadian because he couldn't do the accent, is absolutely perfect in the role! He definitely deserved his Oscar, and no one would argue that it's the best performance of his career. He's sweet, funny, big-hearted, reluctantly passionate, and completely believable in his surroundings. David Niven is many things\u2014handsome, debonair, classy\u2014but none of his special talents would be needed in the part. The Charlie Allnut character needs to be uncouth. He needs to seem like he's really lived on a boat in Africa for years with gin as his only companion and love far from his mind. He needs to be Humphrey Bogart.But, on to Kate. Katharine Hepburn gives one of her best and classic performances as the straight-laced, religious spinster with an unexpected fiery passion. She's absolutely delightful, showing a range of emotions that are so believable it'll be hard to see her as anyone else in the future. She's logical and smart, but also sensitive and loving. The African Queen is one of my all-time favorite love stories\u2014and old movies\u2014because of the sweet, tender moments the unlikely pair share. From the awkward tea party in the beginning of the film when Humph's stomach can't stop growling to their first journey down the rapids and beyond, they'll make themselves a permanent home in your heart. After they've declared their love, Kate finally asks him what his first name is\u2014it's so adorable! Upon hearing it, she smiles like a young girl and sweetly says, \"What a nice name. Charlie. Charlie!\" I could continue to quote all the lovely, adorable, memorable phrases from the romance, but you should really see them for yourself. Whether you end up adding \"And you call yourself a Christian!\" or \"Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put on this earth to rise above\" or \"Then do so, Mr. Allnut\" to your household phrases, I'm sure you'll love The African Queen just as much as I do.

Throw in the fact that they cannot escape and must do what they must do. You see the frightened, hesitant duo, slowly melt into each other. There is dignity everywhere. What is said, is said correctly. Bogart's character could have been moody and angry, but he wasn't raised that way. He is actually a little hesitant to approach this woman. She speaks in that cautious way of hers, making little pronouncements about who he is and what he should do. But she never takes on that firebrand thing that she often did in other movies. The journey down the river is an archetype, done so many times. But it's not the journey. It's the affection developing between two very kind people who also get to a side that shows their strengths when the chips are down.

            "content": "Comedy, drama, action, romance, suspense . . . `The African Queen' blends all these elements flawlessly into one phenomenal film.  The film, for the most part, features just two characters on a thirty-foot boat . . . but the boat's not ordinary, and neither are the characters.  Katherine Hepburn gives one of her greatest performances ever as missionary Rose Sayer, and Humphrey Bogart puts in THE best performance of his career as the grungy, affable captain of the `African Queen', Charlie Allnut.The plot is fairly simple -- it's 1914, and Allnut is a riverboat captain in Africa, bringing mail and other sundries from one port to another.  One of the places he brings mail to is a missionary led by the British reverend Samuel Sayer (Robert Morley) and his sister Rose.   With the outbreak of World War I, German troops overrun the missionary -- Samuel dies, and Allnut manages to spirit Rose away to safety.  Allnut finds himself challenged, though, when Rose concocts a plan -- not to flee from the Germans, but to attack the German ship `Louisa', which controls the African rivers.The story is more about the relationship between Rose and Allnut than about the journey of the `African Queen' itself -- where these two characters travel emotionally is far more important than where they go physically. Allnut starts out as a world-weary traveler, content with his comfortable life of piloting his boat and drinking his gin.  It takes meeting someone like Rose to make him realize that there might be more wonderful things in his life that he might be missing.  In a similar way, Rose is an extremely sheltered woman, committed to the missionary and to her brother; when those things are stripped away from her, she is forced to see what else the world might hold for her.  The story moves nicely between comedy and drama as well -- there's a funny scene early on where Allnut has some embarrassingly loud gas, but in the very next scene, he's trying hard to offer comfort to Rose, even though he can't find the words to offer that comfort.  Hepburn is brilliant as Rose, struggling to maintain her dignity even though she's an emotional whirlwind, and Bogart . . . man, Bogart's simply the best.  He's incredibly funny, he's deadly serious, and perhaps most importantly . . . he's polite.  It's a great touch how he always politely calls Rose `Miss' throughout the film, no matter how urgent or dangerous the situation, simply because he believes that Rose should be treated with respect.  Bogart's portrayal of Charlie Allnut won him an Oscar in 1951; and quite honestly, it might be one of the top ten performances ever captured on film. Ever.Director John Ford does a great job with the film as well -- the shots of the `African Queen' going down the rapids are simply breathtaking, and an eerie (and somewhat repulsive) scene involving Allnut and some leeches is skillfully handled as well.  Equally impressive, though, is how Ford handles the scenes between Bogart and Hepburn are fantastic as well.  Many times, while one character speaks, Ford chooses to focus on the other character that's listening, capturing a small smile or the sagging of shoulders to let the audience know what that other character's reaction is without the use of dialogue.  There's easily a dozen or so small touches like this throughout `The African Queen' that set it slightly above other great films, and into the realm of the masterpiece.Enough rambling.  It's one of the best films ever made, without question. Go watch it!!  Grade: A+",

            "content": "Classic or not, I'll admit I struggled with this one a little bit. The course of events requires a certain measure of suspension of disbelief - it's about five minutes of the runtime, and 2 days in-universe, between saintly missionary Rose learning there's a war in Europe and her demanding that Mr. Allnut makes a torpedo. Both the sense of adventure and the air of levity about the feature alternates between suitably adult human drama, and hokey gallivanting that's one musical number short of being a kid's movie. At some points Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn turn in reliably strong displays of acting, while at others it seems all but undeniable that both were heavily hitting the sauce before, during, and after every day of filming, and were very loopy as a result. I don't say these things to disparage the feature, yet one has certain expectations of older films that are marketed to adult viewers, and the feeling of a mid-century live-action Disney flick isn't among them. With all this said I do enjoy 'The African Queen' - it's perhaps just not quite what I anticipated.What's most immediately notable to me about the title, and praiseworthy, is the very work poured into the production. To read even cursorily of the history informs of the difficult conditions involved in filming on location, and what the cast and crew went through to complete it. I've a strong admiration for that labor, the hair and makeup work, costume design, set design and decoration, props, and effects. Even for all the subjective peculiarities that threaten one's engagement, 'The African Queen' is very well made, and especially as the length progresses it's easy to get swept up in the (better aspects of the) pure essence of adventure. This goes as well for Bogart and Hepburn's performances, and plot development as a whole - while the writing and orchestration of every scene is rather strong in building a fairly compelling story. It takes a regrettable while to truly carry the intended impact, but at its best the movie really is quite good.I can't say this is the inescapably riveting viewing experience I assumed or had hoped for, as value only just exceeds what I believe are shortcomings. Even as the very end delivers one last solid story beat, it also offers another that feels like an unbelievable contrivance of Movie Magic (was no one on the warship watching the water?). Still, if imperfect, it's entertaining. 'The African Queen' is well made from a technical standpoint, is filled with welcome detail, and boasts two household names as stars while telling a fun if faulty story - one way or another, it's a classic, and it still holds up modestly well even several decades later.",

(possible spoilers ahead folks!!)Charlie Ulnut (Humphrey Bogart) is the captain of a clapped out riverboat (The African Queen), and makes his living carrying mail and supplies to the local mine and villages. He likes his gin, and is content with his idyllic life.Rose Sayer (Katharine Hepburn)is a middle-aged English spinster who has spent her entire life following in the footsteps of her brother (Robert Morley). When he volunteered to become a missionary preacher in Africa, she went too. Rose is very prim and strait-laced, and has never experienced life.The two are thrown together when, in 1914, German troops overrun the preachers village and cause his death. Charlie, out of pity, takes her under his wing; but Rose's Grief becomes anger directed towards the Germans, and the unwilling Charlie has no choice but to cooperate in a plot to sink the German cruiser 'Louisa' on a downstream lake.On their journey down the river, these two complete opposites form a bond which ultimately turns to love. Together they face and overcome many hazards such as white water, German snipers, and the leeches (ugh!!). All this and the knowledge that once they start, there is no going back!!!There are many memorable scenes including the one where Charlie wakes with a hangover, only to find Rose disposing of his entire stock of gin!! his expression is unforgettable! Another classic moment is when Charlie tries to enter Rose's sleeping quarters; the outraged Rose thinks he is making a pass at her, but all he wants is to get out of the rain!!Along with these are several poignant scenes; the one where the preacher has succumbed to delirium, just after the German attack, is particular moving, and one cannot help but feel pity for this poor man. Another is when Charlie emerges from the river covered in leeches; his repulsion is very real, and he knows he has to go back in againOne scene, however, that struck me as being a little contrived was the scene where they have just survived the rapids, and their love surfaces for the first time. Their kiss is supposed to be spontaneous, but you can clearly see Charlie makes several unsuccessful attempts first.The film is also memorable for the magnificent scenery of the African jungle and the wildlife. This film definitely scores a 9/10.",

            "content": "Spoilers ahead.        The African Queen is splendid fun and a must for Bogart fanatics like myself.  Bogart once again plays a rough around the edge everyman character, in this case Charlie Ulnet, a riverboat captain, who engages in an unlikely romance with Rose Sayer, an upper class missionary played by Katharine Hepburn.  She left alone and helpless when German troops overrun a mission run by her brother, and he takes her aboard out of pity.  She proves however to be far from helpless, devising a crazy scheme to get revenge on the Germans who are responsible, by sinking the Louisa a German warship that provides the primary German military presence in the area.\tThe character essentially recaps Bogey's role in Casablanca, he's a man who's a selfish and roguish outsider, on the surface, but he has the heart of a lion-hearted idealist.  Like in Casablanca, it takes the love of a woman to crack his cynical shell and make him into a paladin.  Of course in Casablanca, he was already in love with the woman who fills this role, and in fact her initial rejection of him was one of the things that turned him into a hardened cynic.  In Casablanca, also, the two lovers have to sacrifice their connection for the greater good at the end.  In the African Queen Bogey gets to cream the bad guys and get the girl, this makes the film less bittersweet, but also less complex.  (In case anyone was wondering the characters that Bogey plays in this one and in Casablanca were obviously the basis for the character of Han Solo in Star Wars).\tMost of the fun in the African Queen comes from the chemistry between Bogey and Hepburn.  It's a relationship that crosses class lines and as a result changes them both.  Like so many great movie relationships they begin as antagonists and a series of dangerous situations, survived by reluctant cooperation drive them together.  The process changes them both.  Sayer has a civilizing effect on Charlie, steering him away from his self destructive excesses, at the same time Charlie and the river itself drag Rose off her upper class pedestal, she is made tougher and earthier and infinitely more appealing by the ordeal.  Nevertheless, they retain their essential natures, no matter how she smoothes his rough edges, he remains wild and undomesticated, and no matter how much she weathers the elements, she retains an aristocratic elegance (Hepburn always has this).  The two have their lives redirected by their romance without loosing what makes them uniquely them.\tLike Aguirre the Wrath of God, and Apocalypse Now this movie studies the effects of being isolated with the forces of nature through a long ride down a dangerous river.  However this movie is almost the polar opposite of those films.  Herzog and Coppola assume that the wildness of nature and the oppressive claustrophobia of a people in close proximity will spawn hatred distrust, decay, and eventually self-annihilation. John Huston takes a far more optimistic view of human nature, believing that shared hardship will unite and strengthen people.  Which view is true?  `The opposite of a small truth is false; the opposite of a great truth is also true.'.  The African Queen, shows us one side of human nature, those later more cynical films, show us the other.  Made after the Vietnam War, those later films are less crowd-pleasing, more uncompromising, bleaker and more artistic in their intent.  Still the African Queen is both a triumph and great fun.  It's scripted by the Pulitzer Prize winning novelist and movie fanatic James Agee.  Based on a novel by C.S. Forester.9/10",

It's set in 1914 Africa and is about a missionary named Rose Sayer who goes on a boat ride with captain Charlie Alnut in order to sink the German Louisa ship (this is the beginning of WWI).  One of my favorite parts was when Rose was sleeping under a canopy in the boat and Charlie came in to get out of the rain.  \"Mr. Alnut what are you doing?\" was what she said.  \"Me? Uh-nothin' miss!\" was Mr. Alnut's reply.  \"Well get out this instant!\"  One thing that I can't understand is why Rose would wear such a long dress in such hot weather.  I guess even when she isn't in England she must remain properly dressed.  This movie has it all: Romance, Comedy, Action, Adventure, along with great acting done by Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart.",

            "content": "\"Easy does it, miss, don't wear yourself out\", instructs Bogart to Hepburn as she works the pumping handle of his ship. It's a scene that seemingly inspired - to far more obvious effect - the clay modelling in \"Ghost\". For African Queen is an innocent little film, and when Bogart emerges from a lake covered in leeches from head to foot, the only place the leeches don't end up is the same place as on Wil Wheaton in \"Stand By Me\". Similarly, when Bogart (Charlie Allnut) and Hepburn (Rose Sayer) finally sleep together, there's no on-screen visual prompt to say that they have. They share a chaste kiss, the next thing it's morning. This element is also quite innovative, as, while this is a likeably predictable \"class opposites thrown together who fall in love\" movie, there's still over three quarters of an hour left post-sex.I did find it rather odd that this was the film that Bogart was so lauded for. Nominated three times, this was his only Oscar win (and against decent competition, too, such as Marlon Brando in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\") plus his only nomination for the British equivalent. I say odd as, while he gives a fine performance, it's certainly not as outstanding as some of his other work, and I would even go so far as to say that there are instances where his pacing and inflection in his lines are all wrong. Or was he supposed to sound sarcastic when he hears of the death of Hepburn's brother? And in 79 film roles, it seems strange that only one should get so much acclaim.With the actor's name attached, word-of-mouth seems to have blown this one up as a classic to be revered. The fact is, it's merely a jolly, lightweight romantic comedy. Okay, you can't imagine Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan getting dirty and grimy, their mission to torpedo a German ship in the jungles of Africa, but the mismatched lovers routine is the whole show. The Nazi element may be the impetus, but the film is really all about Hepburn throwing away Bogart's gin, or their inevitable first kiss.The Nazis themselves are portrayed as jocular characters, who get blinded by sunlight or say to an aggravating Humphrey: \"I shall hang you twice I think\". Obviously this is a much, much better film than \"The Perfect Storm\", but after seeing that picture's highly convincing special effects, viewing a toy boat bouncing off studio waves then cutting to the two stars in front of a film backdrop is quite amusing. Look out too for a scene where the two bathe in the water. Hepburn is implied to be nude, and we see most of her legs, arms, and torso, all bare flesh. Yet moments later, when she calls upon Bogart to help her aboard, she suddenly sports a full undergarment out of thin air.John Huston's direction is good, and does make nice use of the actual African shooting. James Agee too puts in a literate script. Music, though, by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is at times over the top. While it may be important in terms of plot and character when the two stars first enter the boat, or Bogart takes his first drink of gin, having the full orchestra blaring up behind the two events blows them out of all proportion.Nothing else really matters: this is a two-hander all the way. The two stars are in control, and, while both have been better, they give first class renditions. It's amiable, fluffy and not to be taken seriously. I wonder how shocked the makers were when they found this one in the AFI? 6/10.",

It's just beautiful and it's the best feature of the film.  Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are an unlikely pair who end up together on a boat in a jungle in Africa.  The actors are skillful as is the director.  The two leads are energetic and lively.  It is a very good film which, unfortunately, lags in a couple of spots and has some noticeable plot holes. It is generally engrossing, but there are a few minor flaws in Hepburn's and Bogart's portrayals as well as a couple of minor flaws in the script detracting from the otherwise fine story's sincerity and authenticity. Despite the minor glitches, this is an admirable film.  I recommend it and rate it a 90/100.  It's a minor classic.",

I don't think The African Queen is anything that makes it the be all and end all BUT it is a very entertaining, fun, old classic flick. This is only the second film I have ever seen with Bogart, the first being Casablanca and his zany, alcoholic, lovable old Charlie Allnut is fun and hilarious and just easy to watch. Katherine Hepburn is the polar opposite as the reserved and proper Rose Sayer and together they make the most awkwardly opposite and perfect couple. To say the romance however is rushed is a huge understatement. They go from fun love/hate banter to making out on the boat in a split second with no segway to their romance which bogs it down just a little. I suppose that chemistry is what makes this film so popular with film critics and movie lovers.The scenery is stunning and the story is unique in its own way. Legendary director John Huston spins a story using the right combination of characters and setting. Everything about this movie is perfect to be an rip roaring entertaining adventure with the perfect dash of romance. I don't mean to take anything from it but the fact remains it also doesn't bring anything to the table that makes it truly exceptional in my opinion. I suppose because its stood the test of time and features two legendary Hollywood icons that it understandably gets hyped up so much.

It may be that it is the treatment it has been given and Forester is not to blame at all or it may be that it just wasn't what I was expecting (I actually don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this).To start with I thought it would be a nice change to see World War 1 from an African perspective and through the eyes of Katherine, Robert and Humpty, but I don't think you can really class this as a war film at all and what you do see of WW1 is minimal.Bumpy Go-Kart gives a great performance to start with and then he becomes all loved up and he just seems silly, so unused am I to seeing him in a role that isn't more grumpy with a harder masculine edge to it. I'm not sure how he got an Oscar for this and not 'The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre'.Katharine has always stuck out a bit as an actress for me. In a way she does a great job here, but also seems to be a caricature at the same time.The story is a bit slow as it literally takes you down a river with not much happening and on a boat so small I'm not quite sure why you would bother to write a book or make a film about it. I think I was expecting a boat with a bit more grandeur.Their is very little action and their cause is a little bit hard to believe in the first place. It was also difficult to feel the seriousness of what they were trying to achieve with a soundtrack that appeared to have come from a Disney film.\nAt times it feels like an advert for African safari's as they show stock footage of animals to flesh it out.I wouldn't be adverse to reading the original story, but I certainly won't rush to watch this again as it doesn't contain enough of what interests me.",

Opening up with close-up shots perusing indigenous dwellers out of exoticism, with an accompanying carol of psalm conducted by Rev. Samuel Sayer (Morley) and his sister Rose (Hepburn) in the 1st Methodist Church in Kungdu, which reeks of condescendence and Pharisaism since none of the locals have a clue of what they are parroting, and the unhealthy allusion of them to a bunch of predators when the boat owner Charlie's (Bogart) unfinished cigarette is up for grabs doesn't ameliorate the revulsion albeit its intention of being funny, nevertheless Bogart's belly is just as musical as his singing. Luckily soon we embark on an adventure strictly includes only Rose and Charlie, it's never too late to fall in love, after the initial distinction around Rose's starry-eyed strategy, the flame of romance is kindled during a perilous passage with rapids. The thrill of riding the waves must stir up an old maiden's passion, the two-hander between Bogart and Hepburn is tremendously entertaining to watch, Bogart plays against his usual detached sangfroid, totally unreserved as a down-to-earth ilk, it is quite refreshing to know this role capped him an Oscar statue, when he imitates a roaring hippopotamus, the joy is tangible and it is a precious moment for Boart's screen image; Hepburn is at the top of her game as well, her appellation to Charlie changed from Mr. Allnut to dear is handled with a heartwarming vignette, and she is also the trailblazer who pioneers a progressive view as a fearless woman, challenges Bogart to the final assail gallantly meanwhile her tender moment with the man she loved is truly touching. The film is also a taxing endeavor in a physical sense, frowzily dressed under the sizzler, all the river turbulence they have to endure (although it is too dangerous to be shoot live on-set, the post-produced and recreated effect is just passable), slogging through the reed-rampant water area by trawling the boat manually, not to mention the fake mosquitoes and leeches (most of the crew were under the weather during the shooting). Near the coda, Houston deftly injects some gallows humor into their capture by the German navy, but the final twist is merely ludicrous, the capsize is exerted with a slapdash hurry, anyway, it is a genuine romantic exploit can woo a massive fun-seeking, love-hankering viewers plus many non-German patriots and for Huston and his team, it was a lavish hunt for novelty paid by the company and the inception of a long-standing friendship between Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn.",

Firstly, the distance between A and B was a lot shorter \u2013 in the beginning, there was more of a slight annoyance or a stiff reservation than a downright hatred or dislike, and it didn't take very long before they fell into each other's arms. Secondly, Hepburn's character was a lot less annoying. I still don't think she (or Bogart) is very good, but I didn't exactly want her to die this time, and I guess their chemistry is all right. The romance was probably a bit less sappy, whereas the adventure and the finale were decidedly less riveting.One thing I did notice to a larger extent now was the pleasant Technicolor work, which is used to the greatest effect when there is a lot of nature on the screen, such as the opening scene where the camera sneaks through the jungle and enters the East African village of Kungdu. But other than that, The African Queen is still just a decent romantic adventure that I don't quite get the praise for.",

Two of these missionaries are Christian Missionaries Rose Sayer & Reverend Samuel Sayer (Katharine Hepburn & Robert Morley) and sadly the shock of what happens to their village is too much for Reverend Sayer and he unfortunately dies the following day. Gin-swilling riverboat captain Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) suggests that he and Rose bury her brother's body and flee the camp as soon as possible before the Germans return. Although Charlie and Rose are two very different people they attempt to put their differences aside in order to avenge Rose's brother's death....Given that the majority of the film is spent with only 2 people sharing the screen it is fairly obvious that Director John Huston was reliant on the star power of Bogart and Hepburn to carry this film and ultimately win audiences over. Hats off to Huston because it seems that he has achieved this objective as this film is loved by a good deal of people, but for me it was a bit hit-and-miss...If we start with Bogart and Hepburn; yes I'm prepared to accept that they were both good together on-screen and yes they generally share good chemistry together, but are these things alone enough to make the film great?? I beg to differ I'm afraid. One thing I found disappointing is that Huston doesn't make this feel like much of an adventure film. Most of the time revolves around Bogart and Hepburn and their blossoming relationship, but this is all Huston really focuses on and although it is fun and interesting in fits and starts when the plot only focuses on one think it does make the film feel a bit monotonous at times. The picture is stronger in the second half when Rose and Charlie start working as a team to overcome problems that they encounter on their journey - these aspects make the film feel more focused and enjoyable and give the film its much needed sense of adventure. If we go back to Rose and Charlie's relationship, I kind of felt that there was a bit of an Odd Couple vibe between Charlie and Rose, but if I'm honest I felt that the switch between them hating each other and liking each other was a bit jarring and sudden and felt a little unnatural. The final part of the film where Charlie and Rose are effectively getting their revenge felt rushed and it would have been better if the planning of their attack would have featured more heavily rather than being merely tagged on at the end.The African Queen is notably the film where Bogart won his best actor award and whilst I'm pleased that he received it I can't honestly see how this performance really stands out from anything else I've seen him in - he was good but Oscar worthy??? Hepburn is an equal match for Bogart and their chemistry and camaraderie does make up slightly for the thin and rather uneven plotting.The African Queen is an OK film but when all is said and done I can't really see why everyone is so in love with it?? It's a thinly plotted film with too much romance and not enough adventure and for me is another disappointingly over-hyped 'classic film.'",

            "content": "Charlie Allnut is a rascal. He is also a boat captain in Africa, who ferries things up and down the river in 1914. One day he stops at a missionary, where prim Rose Sayer is preaching along with her brother. Charlie has tea with them, but to say they get along is an overstatement. Charlie leaves, but not before telling the English Rose and her brother that Germany has declared war.Soon after he leaves, the camp is taken over by Germans, who burn the huts down and leave Rose and her brother to fend for them selves. Her brother catches the fever, and dies. It is then that Charlie comes back. He helps Rose bury her brother, and then asks her along to wait out the war in the jungle. Soon after, they find a place to hide, when Rose begins to look at a map.She asks Charlie why they can't go up the river, and he tells her that there are rapids, a German fort, waterfalls, and at the end, a big German steamer, patrolling the lake so the British can't move down. Noticing Charlie has a lot of explosives, that he was carrying for the mine, Rose asks if they can't ride to the lake, and then blow up the German steamer. Charlie says no, but Rose persists, and you can see where this is going.I know it sounds dark, but it is really anything but.There is one thing that can impede you from enjoying The African Queen: cynicism. You cannot look at this film from a cynical point of view. You'll hate it. That said, you can going into it being cynical, but you have to drop it after five minutes. Okay, got it? Good, we can move on. Three films have been called Huston's best: The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of The Sierra Madre and The African Queen. At least, from what I've heard.I did not like The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, and as I have not reviewed The Maltese Falcon, I'll hold judgment until then. So what is Huston's best film? The African Queen, from what I've seen. Many people have tried to describe the essence of this film. Is it Bogart, Hepburn or Huston? Is it the shooting on location? Or maybe the story? I cannot pinpoint the film's greatness. It is like a cozy den, that once you've entered, you never want to leave.The only other film I've had such a reaction to is Casablanca. It is a great film, but why? The performances by Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are certainly part of that magic.You only have to see them on screen for a second, and you are instantly with them. Bogart plays the kind of character only Bogart could play, and likewise with Hepburn. They inhabit their characters with an energy that cannot be defined. You do not think of them as Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, but as Rose Sayer and Charlie Allnut.The characters are that memorable. It is the kind of love story that feels alive and fresh, despite how in a different film it would seem clich\u00e9d. Here it embraces the clich\u00e9, and is better because of it. The development feels like a natural extension of the plot. Speaking of plot, the screenplay by James Agee and John Huston achieves that perfect balance of giving you a plot that keeps you interested, and two leads you cannot help but love.Agee had a heart attack before he could finish the screenplay, so Huston brought it down to Africa to finish it. He brought Peter Viertel to work on it with him, and sometimes they would write the next scene the day before it was shot. Shooting on an actual river in Africa must have presented a massive challenge for the cinematographer, but he succeeded admirably. The film is neither a walking travel ad, but it doesn't forget about it's landscape either.Perhaps the only weak link is the score, but even that can not impede the film from greatness. This brings me to Huston's direction. He has often been accused of his films looking staged, with no amazing cinematic tricks employed. I cannot defend him, but I can say this. Huston is a director. He is not an actor's director, a cinematographer's director, or a screenwriters director. He is truly a director, he oversees all aspects of production with the same wise gaze. He is not an auteur. He trusts the people he works with to do a good job, and just oversees them doing it. This kind of film making is the only kind that would work for The African Queen. And it does, Huston delivers yet another beautiful adventure film. If you are feeling low, this is the kind of film that can make you feel better. When I gave The Dead ten stars, it took me a while to make the decision. Here it took me a second. The African Queen is an indisputable masterpiece, for now and for always.The African Queen, 1951, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Morely, Directed by John Huston, 10/10 (A+)(This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

            "content": "My Rating : 9/10Lady and The Tramp Steamer.It isn't grit and a cranky steam-engine that get the rickety 'African Queen' down the Bora River - it's sheer star-power. The German Navy, alligators, and leeches don't stand a chance against the likes of Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn at full throttle. Both are a bit past their prime and it's a brilliant ploy to provide them with characters that aren't merely mature simulacra of their former images. Bogart, as an almost clownishly coarse, simple-minded lug with a taste for gin, completely submerges himself in the role of Charlie Allnut. You suspect that this is the kind of character he would've loved to have been playing all along rather than those smoky, hard-boiled detectives. When he giddily imitates the animals on shore for Rose's pleasure, especially his routine as a very cute hippo you can't quite believe this was Rick of 'Casablanca'. Hepburn is more recognisable - it's almost impossible to hide her unique persona but Hepburn's Rose is a new creation, righteous fortitude underpinned with touching vulnerability, a combination more often evident later in her career. These two legends are fascinating to observe, that's good because there's not much else to do - the plot is pure formula : Unlikely lovers meet, beat the odds and live happily ever after at the Academy Awards!Katharine Hepburn was ordered by a studio executive, early in her career, never to smile. 'It makes you look like a horse'. She defied the edict, of course, but in repose there's something ineffably secretive and powerful about her, like a monarch withholding her personal suffering from her subjects.'Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put into this world to rise above.' - Rose.",

It feels weird to say this, given that the two leads are legends of Hollywood but given that 90% of this is just the two of them on a boat I need there to be some chemistry between the two and I never felt that. Bogie is doing his thing. Hepburn is doing hers. At no point does it feel like they're meshing well to me and that's a big problem. Their relationship feels so weird, forced and clunky that I just can't get into it.It was available on Prime for me, so it's easy enough to watch for most so I'd still recommend checking it out if you can stream it but maybe just adjust expectations accordingly. \"I pronounce you man and wife.

If this was the first such character for her (as I'm led to believe), then the rest of her career consisted of nothing but typecasting. The elements that bother me most about this film, however, are Mr. Allnut's mild acceptance of a stubborn woman COMANDEERING his sole means of survival and income to engage in a ridiculous enterprise; Mr. Allnut's apathetic acceptance of the disposal of all of his gin; The moronically rapid development of the two character's relationship; and, finally, the coincidental collision of the Louisa with the mostly-sunk African Queen on a HUGE lake the day after a HUGE storm at the exact moment of our heroes' execution!

If you were looking for a reluctant hero, he would probably have been the ultimate casting choice of his time. Then there was Kate Hepburn, also without rival if what you needed was a fiercely independent, strong willed female figure. Much of the joy in \"The African Queen\" comes from putting these two well-known, larger than life personalities together and then watching the sparks fly. Of course, when you have the great John Huston overseeing proceedings, you know you're not gonna be short of a few thrilling set-pieces detailed in exotic locales, either...So what unfolds then is a terrifically entertaining battle of wills on tumultuous waters. You know that after all they've been through, they'll finally reach a place of mutual respect and affection, but the transition between feelings is subtly dealt with by a smart script. It proves that a romance between two people who've been around the block can lift the heart just as well as youthful passion.The voyage we are asked to take on \"The African Queen\" proves to be a richly entertaining one.",

We remember only the finest cars we owned, the prettiest girls we dated, the finest meals we ever ate, etc. So it goes with entertainment and movies I suppose. Of the thousands of movies I've seen over my sixty plus years, there are perhaps 30 or so that I remember with both clarity and fondness. At the top of the list would be movies that starred Humphrey Bogart; in my estimation, the finest actor who ever lived. African Queen was probably one of the first Bogart movie that I ever saw and I was simply mesmerized by his and Katherine Hepburn's portrayals of a hard drinking roustabout teamed up with a prim and proper lady. The interaction between the 2 as they make their way along a dangerous river in a beat up little steam powered boat named \"African Queen\", all the while trying to avoid Nazi forces, is absolutely unforgettable. It's one of those movies that sucks you in and won't let go until the final scene rolls and the screen fades to black.

Well, Spiegel and director John Huston must have been grinning like Cheshire cats for many years to come after the big success that was 'The African Queen'.The great thing about the film is it's performances by it's two leads, Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. A very unlikely pairing, for starters. Bogart was the tough, cynical man-of-the-world who was often on his lady Bacall's arm. Hepburn was Spencer Tracy's girl; a spinsterish, fiery sort who looked unwilling to compromise for love. The opposites-attract teaming worked brilliantly with Bogart and Hepburn enjoying terrific chemistry. She's the prim spinster sister of a Methodist minister, he's the gin-swilling boat captain who must transport her back to civilization during World War One. The pairing isn't glamorous, but this film (and their relationship) quickly blossoms into one of cinema's greatest stories of love and survival.It's a different role for Bogart. He did a lot of his best work for Huston, and he won the Academy Award (his sole Oscar) for his role as Charlie Allnut. While it isn't his best performance, IMO, (In A Lonely Place and The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre hold that place in my book)he is really great. Did he deserve the Oscar over Brando in 'Streetcar' and Clift in 'A Place In The Sun' that year? Probably not, but Bogart did deserve to be awarded for his outstanding contribution to film, so I was happy with his win. Hepburn was nominated too but lost out to Vivien Leigh for 'Streetcar'.Enough Oscars talk. This film has some stunning cinematography, amazing action sequences and a wonderful script that allows Hepburn and Bogart to portray their characters at the fullest. It is one of the triumphs of the cinema, this film. There's nothing more enjoyable than watching bible-quoting Hepburn be softened by love, Bogart engage in animal antics to cheer his girl, and Huston handle the rapids with technical ease.10/10.",

In reviewing the picture you are almost reviewing more than just the story, acting, and direction you have to review the iconography of an old romanticized Hollywood. There are a lot of cases where you almost don't want to believe or fall for the legends but 'The African Queen' is not one of them. It is a picture that rightly makes you a bright eyed romantic based purely on the strengths of Hepburn and Bogart. Bogart and Hepburn have such iconic persona that the movie it's self kind of has an adjustment before you can fully engross yourself in the story. It's an old fashioned film and I mean that in the best way possible. This formula sizzles with Bogart and Hepburn when to be frank I think with others you'd laugh at the film and not with it. The dialogue to be frank is way over the top. Bogart's romantic banter sounds like something someone might say to a dog. It cannot be overstressed how much charm he has in the part. There is a wink at the camera in almost every scene and it works. Bogart was never an excellent actor but by God he was an excellent personality that exuded confidence and coolness. Hepburn has such fire and like Bogart is essential for us to buy the conceit of this film.This movie is excellent and goofy. It will make you smile.",

This is Taxed in the Finale and the Ending Confrontation with the Germans is Extremely Contrived.Overall, Much to Enjoy and it Works Fine Most of the Time. A Must See for Film Buffs and Casual Viewers will Find it Well Worth a Watch.",

            "content": "If there is ANYBODY who has yet to see The African Queen (and I mean for the very first time) then be forewarned there are spoilers below:Although I remember being thrilled by this when I first saw it (as it doubtless thrilled movie goers who saw it on the big screen in the early 1950's), when I turn a critical eye towards the movie today, its flaws are obvious. If the movie succeeds at all, it does so on sheer star power alone - and star power it has. Who can resist the great Hepburn and the great Bogey? Certainly not I - I was entertained and to an extent charmed by the grace and the magnitude of these bona-fide screen legends. But in the final analysis, it is the very magnitude of these superstars that does the movie in. Where there could have be a real sense of peril and doom - with a few exceptions it felt like a walk in the park. The only exception, I would say, was the leeching scene. When Bogy returns to the parasite infested water, the look on his face made me shudder in my shoes. But other than that, they treated the journey much like a jaunt to the corner store. Laughing at the hippos (incredibly dangerous to humans in real life), blithely ignoring the crocs, the lions, the chimpanzees - this was kind of a travelogue - I never once felt that they were in any danger from predators. The river itself with the whitewater scenes did provide a little excitement, but it was quickly over. Then Bogey just whips up a campfire and repairs the damaged propeller and shaft. When at first he stated that it would be impossible to do so, he should have stuck to his guns. It would have been. A straightened shaft and a neatly welded prop blade was a ridiculous outcome. The way they suddenly embraced and became love birds was equally inane. The way they calmly accepted the German captain's death sentence was just over the top. The whole plan was a joke, and Bogey knew it from the start. The movie would have been far more tense and convincing had he stuck to his guns and they somehow had to navigate out of trouble but with a much more realistic narrative. Many classic movies from the past display the same tendency to rely on its star power and neglect the true facts of life, ignoring the reality that one-in-a-million strokes of luck actually only happen one-in-a-million times. The Louisa striking the \"torpedo\" on the sunken Queen, and Hepburn and Bogey (who had lost everything) swimming off in laughter was the final straw. The art of cinema has benefited greatly by the fantastic directors and screenwriters who came after. Movies were still in their infancy in 1951, and it shows. If it were done today the same way, the movie would by laughed off the screen and out of the theaters in a week.",

            "content": "Not the greatest movie ever made but very close to being the best adventure film of the 50's. The role of Charlie Allnut was not one that you would automatically think would belong to Humphrey Bogart but he certainly gave a performance of a lifetime. Bogart was toiling in gangster roles as a contract player at Warner Bros. and usually played the heavy, unlike his biggest rival, James Cagney whose gangsters always had a sympathetic aspect of them. Even his \"hero\" roles like Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep were ruthless when needed. Here, he plays an all out good guy and even though he has the same surly disposition in beginning as in some of his former roles it never goes beyond him regretting it in the next scene.Also, Bogart gets a love interest who's roughly the same age as him, something very rare in films of that day. Clark Gable was still playing opposite actresses more than half his age all the way up to his death. You can see that does something. Katharine Hepburn, who plays Rosie, and Bogie actually look believable as lovers and they also look very comfortable playing opposite each other.There have been dozens of comments about director John Huston's wild and unpredictable behaviour when making this film and it was all portrayed in the Clint Eastwood film White Hunter, Black Heart but even if the film had such a troubled production it was certainly worth it. The care of each scene shows and because this is virtually a two person story, the dialog is absolutely brilliant.Hepburn and Bogie are of course two of the biggest reason to see this film and the plot really takes a backseat. The reason it all sort of comes together is the way that Bogie and Hepburn never seem to lose their cool, even in the face of death and to act that way and still make it seem believable is good acting indeed.Bogie had one or two good parts left before he died and Hepburn was of course one of the last survivors of film's golden age. All the more reason to enjoy that you are still able to see this film and go back to a more innocent time.",

They might be some of the only two people that you could leave on a boat together for a whole movie and make it interesting.

John Huston has a great capacity to excite, and in The African Queen he adeptly balances a quality mixture of realistic dirt and Hollywood adventure gloss. The end result is an engaging, fun experience that keeps you interested from start to finish. Also, those leeches were gross as heck.",

Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn escape to the African Queen, a small cargo boat owned by the Bogart character. Setting is World War 1 with the Germans in pursuit. Some comic moments set in as when the leads struggle to adapt and tease viewers with sexual tension. Director John Huston does a superb job and is backed with effective suspense and action although the romantic elements are an ill timed formula that are unnecessarily distracting. Huston previously directed Bogart in Maltese Falcon and Key Largo. Bogart carries some sarcasm while Hepburn maintains a stern disposition especially after her brother is killed but viewers are well aware of what their journey is all about. And despite the romantic drivel the concluding union between the two is priceless. Outside the leading roles, the rest of the characters are waterlogged bores. Robert Morley plays Hepburn's brother who doesn't last very long, and Peter Bull appears in a flat supporting role. It stresses perseverance and equality of genders and a screenplay that doesn't deliver quite as effectively as its reputation boasts. It does delivers with adventure, thrills and the untimely arrival of a cargo boat. Score: 7 / 10",

She is a preacher's spinster sister who along with Charlie seeks to exit inner Africa in a somewhat makeshift boat down a believed-to-be-unnavigable river, to escape from the German colonial forces at the outbreak of World War I.  It is noteworthy that this is often said to be the only movie (well, maybe well-known movie) in which Humphrey Bogart does not play himself -- Charlie is ingenuous and quite good-natured -- but Mr. Allnut's blue collar persona would seem not to be a match for Rose.  A romance develops nevertheless, and while his willingness to face challenges is less than hers, he certainly is chivalrous toward women.  The film's dominant focus on these two, in any event, works brilliantly, and results in one of the all-time classics.  Certainly many difficulties are faced in the river, and the two heroically persevere, while Rose melts as the moving yet not syrupy romance is engendered.  We of course face a final rendezvous with the bad guys.  I cannot think of a movie that is so good while ultimately being so simple and straightforward.",

            "review_title": "Top actors bring a great story to life",
            "content": "\"The African Queen\" is a wonderful story of adventure, drama and love set during World War I in Africa. The movie is based on a 1935 book of the same title, by British novelist C.S. Forester. It was adapted for the screen by American Pulitzer Prize winning writer, actor and producer James Agee. The film excels in all ways. Much of it was filmed in Africa, and the jungle and river scenes are spectacular. It has superb camera work and all production values. John Huston directed the film, and two of the biggest stars of the day are outstanding in their roles. Katherine Hepburn is Rose Sayer, bereaved sister of a British missionary who died after German troops destroyed his mission and beat him. Humphrey Bogart is Charlie Allnut, the captain of a small riverboat, The African Queen. He makes routine trips up and down river to deliver mail, goods and an occasional passenger. Rose now needs to leave the Congo, and The African Queen is the only transport out. The adventure begins with that, as does a nice romance and some heroics. For those who want to know more of the plot, other reviewers provide that. For those who want to enjoy the film and discover the story as it unfolds, these comments won't divulge any more. Rather, some more words about Humphrey Bogart's performance and well-earned Oscar. It was one of three that the film won in the 1951 Academy Awards, and Bogart surely deserved his award. He should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of Dobbs in the 1948 John Huston adventure drama, \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.\" But he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. That film won three Oscars, including Walter Huston for best supporting actor. The best actor award for 1948 went to Laurence Olivier for Hamlet. Olivier was certainly deserving, but no other nominees that year came close to his or Bogart's performances. Bogart's Dobbs, an easy going American looking for work in Mexico, is by far the best portrayal of a male actor who gradually becomes crazed with an obsession. The greed for gold slowly transforms this normal guy into a paranoid lunatic. I don't know what kind of politics may have been at work in Hollywood in 1948 (so often referred or alluded to), but Bogart won a deserved Oscar in 1951 for African Queen. And, he surprised many by beating out Marlon Brando for his equally exceptional performance that year in \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\"But for one other performance in 1954, Bogart may have won a second Oscar that year for his role as Lt. Commander Queeg in \"The Caine Mutiny.\" Marlon Brando's superb role as Terry Malloy in \"On the Waterfront\" won the Oscar for best actor. That may have been payback for his 1951 loss to Bogart. Incidentally, the IMDb listings show various awards that movies and performers receive. Most actors who have lengthy careers with some leads or top supporting roles earn one recognition, if not others. That is having a star placed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Well, every years since 1960, new names of actors and directors from the silver screen, TV and radio are added to the walk. The recognition began on February 8, 1960, with the groundbreaking for the Walk of Fame. That year, 1,558 performers had their stars placed on the new walkway. Humphrey Bogart was one of them. Many others like him were posthumous. Here's a line I especially like from \"The African Queen.\" On their journey down the river, Rose says to Charlie, \"Don't be worried, Mr. Allnut.\" Charlie answers, \"Oh, I ain't worried, miss. Gave myself up for dead back when we started.\"",

            "content": "I remembered The African Queen as a great movie; a rambling adventure, telling the gently romantic story of Charlie and Rosie's Quixotic cruise to sink the Louisa. I remembered snappy dialogue and well-drawn characters. I remembered a movie that moved me equally to laughter and tears.I reviewed it this weekend and found my memory to be in error. The African Queen is not a great movie.The writing is flabby, relying on the established personas of the actors rather than any internal references to convey the depth of the characters. The photography, though adequate, seems poorly knit together, and sometimes clich\u00e9d; for example, the footage of crocodiles slipping into the water after Charlie asks about the presence of the reptiles. Likewise, the sniper fire from the German fort appears to be stock footage.The acting, while not demanding, is pure and crisp. Given little other than exposition to say, Bogart and Hepburn use their inestimable presences to make this middle aged couple come to life. We see that Rosie is the order Charlie yearns for, even before his after-shaving speech on the joys of having a good woman around. We see that Rose had never been Rosie before Charlie and she became lovers, although she'd always wanted to be. No lines suggest these insights, nor do any overt dramatic gestures. Rather tensions in Hepburn's voice, in Bogart's shoulders, in the angles of their body's convey meanings the script cannot find a way to say. And perhaps it should not have to.The script abounds with absurdities, either intentional or otherwise. Charlie says that the river has one hundred miles of rapids. Even assuming \"one hundred miles\" refers to stretches of calm water followed by white water, nothing of so demanding a nature is intimated by the actual events in the movie. We are told that the African Queen can only maintain steerage if she moves faster than the river current, yet the rapids clearly move faster than any speeds the ship ever demonstrates. Rosie's steering through the rapids is then an impossibility.However, the script does convey the wonderful irony of the \"civilized\" worldview of the early 20th century. Rosie says \"Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put in this world to rise above,\" and indeed, she and Charlie appear do just that. They overcome the obstacles of the river and deal firmly with Charlie's human weaknesses. At the last, however, nature, as manifested in the storm that sinks the African Queen and as manifested in the love she and Charlie share, proves as indomitable as it always is.No, this is not a great movie; rather a very good one. And though the great ones are few, the very good ones are not many more in number, and we should be grateful for the cruise of the African Queen.",

            "content": "There are three primary reasons you might want to see this old black and white classic.First it is a beautiful and touching love story. Strait-laced teetotaler (and maiden sister of a preacher) Rose Sayer (Katharine Hepburn) meets a kind of ordinary joe who is a handyman deluxe sort of guy, Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a bit crude and likes to swill his gin. They're in the middle of Africa during the Great War. Her brother has been killed, the Germans have the natives where they want them and, well, Charlie has an old river boat and offers to give the high-toned woman a ride.There is nothing quite like the sparks that fly from opposite poles. And yes, opposites do attract, but of course it takes them awhile to feel the magnetic force. The beautiful thing about this love story is how Charlie proves his mettle and wins her heart--a heart never won before--by sheer gumption and by finding the courage he never knew he had--egged on and inspired by her relentless strength of character. The moment that she realizes, despite all the differences between them, that she loves him is beautifully and exactingly captured by John Huston's superb direction.The second reason to see this cinematic masterwork is the performance by Katherine Hepburn. She has given many outstanding performances; there is hardly an actor anywhere held in higher esteem, nor one who has had a more lasting and admired career. I have seen many of her movies but never have I seen her better. She is just perfect for the part and delivers every line with style and a deep understanding of her character. She allows us to understand that Rose's crazy, na\u00efve beliefs about what is possible infect Charlie to the extent that he becomes something more than himself, and it is that self that she falls madly in love with.The third reason is the inspired performance by Humphrey Bogart. This is not the usual worldly-wise, tough guy that Bogart usually plays. Instead he is an ordinary, though pragmatic joe who knows his limitations. He didn't last this long as a self-styled river boat captain without taking certain precautions in what he would venture and what he would not. Yet, so taken with the relative status and the exquisite high-toned righteousness of Miss Rose Sayer, he is able to do things that ordinarily he wouldn't try. And when she falls in love with him, he is amply rewarded, and the audience loves it.I should add that shots of the boat, the African Queen, and of the animals along the river and in the river seemed authentic and atmospherically perfect even though I've seen a couple hundred much more modern African nature videos.By the way, this movie contains the famous quote, spoken by Miss Hepburn: \"Human nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we were put on this earth to rise above.\" One more thing to add: the movie was adapted by C.S. Forester and James Agee from Forester's novel. Those are two of the best writers to ever work a Hollywood screenplay, and it shows. The dialogue and the development of character and story are exquisitely done so that one is lost in the events and only returns to the real world when the movie ends.Truly, they don't make them like this anymore.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

They plan on using the African Queen, Charlie's boat, as part of their home made torpedo and bomb the German gunboat with it.It's a charming film about patriotism in times of war, exceeding ones limits for what they believe in and finding love even at the most desperate times. Since it's an old film it can't help but suffer from things like overacting and overwhelming orchestral music that distract and dictate what to feel in each scene, but these are things you soon get use to and accept as part of its charm.There are ideas in the film which today seem dated and less than politically correct. The fact that European countries have colonised Africa is not an issue here. The natives are portrayed either as dim- witted villagers unable to behave like \"civilised\" white people or as bloodthirsty goons with riffles working for the evil Germans. Furthermore there are sexist lines from Charlie which sound comical by today's standards. Acknowledging and putting these PC issues aside, the film talks about bravery, hope and love.There are beautiful surroundings and the appearance of bad blue screen is limited. The film is fascinated with all sorts of social contrasts, people of different races, ethnicities and classes interacting with each other, falling in love and fighting. There is a naivety in the issues the film touches upon, like alcoholism, death and war, but the importance of having hope and human willpower is always present. You care for the characters, even though they are insignificant and hopeless. Their persistence to achieve their goal, even when all is lost, is inspiring and makes the film relatable and relevant even today and that's what makes this film a classic. I give it 7/10",

About the only adventure on the river they encounter is bugs and rain.I was thinking if they had died on the ship at the moment the torpedoes hit, that would've been one of the greatest movie ending ever, but there was always happy endings in those days in films...too bad, some times bitter sweet tragedy is beautiful.John Huston did a really good job directing I enjoyed what I was seeing on film.

Bogart is great as the lovable captain but I was never fond of Hepburn's acting in this one, she puts in a strange performance even for her. The movie has aged a great deal since 1951 but that is to be expected. There are some bad special effects and some hammy episodes like the mosquito attack and the forced funniness of him imitating animals. There is also the fact that they are supposed to be from Canada and England but sound nothing like it. The relationship between them is very odd and comes off a bit forced but it's the story and the boat who are the true stars of this classic.",

Humphrey Bogart, six years before his death, plays the Canadian Charlie Allnut with as much effort at the accent as Kevin Costner put into \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\" Katherine Hepburn's appearance betrays the constant dysentery she suffered during the on location parts of the shoot. According to the 1990 Client Eastwood film \"White Hunter, Black Heart\" director John Huston spent most of the shoot chasing an elephant and later cleaning in post production in a London sound studio. The gaps between the London material and that filmed on location (the ending credits just say \"Africa\", I guess you identifying just the continent was good enough back in 1951) are blatantly obvious. However, the story of a proper English missionary spinster finding secular thrills by running rapids and falling in love while exacting explosive revenge against the World War I edition of German imperialism is a good one. Mix in some genuinely good repartee and the exotic location (hippos and alligators and leeches, oh, my!) and you can overlook the high-school-film-strip soundtrack and the laughably bad green screen effects.",

Not exaggerating it but this is what i can say, the perfect combination of Romance, action, comedy and real adventure and probably it's kind of first ever. A British girl accompanied by a riverboat captain to sail over african river. During this adventurous journey they fall in love and remains united while facing all odd, even death at the end. There is hardly anything in the film that can be hated, that can be called bad and that can be called senseless. Humphrey Bogart as Charlie is Charming, funny, kind hearted guy oh how rarely we see Bogart in this kind of light role. It is wonderful to know that he won his only Oscar award for this role. Her partner, lover and i say wife at last, Miss Rosie is played by Katherina Hepburn promisingly, convincingly amd beautifully. Both of them put up a lovely chemistry. 105 mins of screenplay never gets dull for a moment and thanks to the writer, screenwriter and dialogue writer for that. There are so many engrossing moments of fun, adventure, love, faith and romance. The climax too is so amusing and enthralling when you don't want it to end on sad note and it doesn't really disappoint you. I tell you the best part is that The African Queen never looks unrealistic despite having so much adventure because the writer had it done right. He put in War factor so that the story looked like taking place in real life and may be that's why the film connects to our hearts. Bogart and Huston have delivered Classics and great films before but The African Queen is probably the only film with entertainment quotient. Earlier they worked together in several classic noir and thrillers but none of the film made us laugh ike this did. May be this is what they wanted to explore and I can't deny that they have succeeded. The African Queen set that one formula for many lovestories to follow. All said enough i guess, The African Queen is enjoyable adventurous love saga that can be watched again and again and by all kind of audiences.RATING - 7/10*",

He also lets Katherine Hepburn's character get away with way too much self-righteous moralizing; when he wakes up to find her pouring his bottles of gin into the river, I didn't believe for a split second that he wouldn't have pushed her in too.And a word on Katherine Hepburn- in this and all of her films: there is a fine line between \"spunk\" and being obnoxious and I never seem to find her spunky... in spite of the fact that the supporting cast always does. I consider her eternal cinematic pluck more than a bit grating... when she proudly announces to the Germans that she planned to sink their battleship with torpedoes the SS soldiers seem tickled pink- the girl's got moxie! A woman this brazen would have been beaten to death before the age of nine.That said, \"The African Queen\" is still a worthy film- in spite of its flaws and slow pace. One of the Top 100 Films of All-Time as chosen by the American Film Institute? That's another story entirely... especially when both actors gave their best performances elsewhere.GRADE: C",

            "content": "My mum watches (and loves) this movie as a romance, however I watched, and enjoyed, this movie more as an adventure. The first impression I got from this movie was a book I read at university called 'the Heart of Darkness' a story about a river boat captain that sails up a river in the Congo. This movie differs as they are not traveling up the river, but rather down it. Further, one can argue that the hero of the movie is the boat, The African Queen, and the main antagonist in the movie is the river. Bogart and Hepburn are more supporting characters rather than the lead.The movie begins in an African village deep in the jungle where a missionary and his sister are teaching the villagers civilisation. One notes immediately that what the missionary is teaching them is not all that interesting to them, for when Bogart arrives, they immediately flock to him, expecting cigars. However, the missionary learns that war has broken out in Europe, and quickly comes to their village when the Germans arrive, enslave the population, but leaves the missionary and his sister alone. Then the missionary dies of malaria, but fortunately Bogart returns to assist Hepburn leave the village.This is when the main part of the movie begins. Beyond the adventure of traveling down a river in darkest Africa, the two characters, who are opposites, must learn to not only live together, but to also survive. For an English lady, Hepburn turns out to be very smart, incredibly insightful, and motivate, while for a rough bushman, Bogart turns out to be a coward.There is romance in this movie, but to me the romance is more akin to what one would expect from an Indiana Jones movie than from a Jane Austin novel, and the movement of the movie is not focused on the blossoming relationship between Hepburn and Bogart, but rather their movement towards a goal that lies at the end of the river.Personally, I do not think this is one of Bogart's best movies - his film noir is so much better, however this is still a great movie, worthy of the great actor that was Humphrey Bogart.",

Bogart has proved his success with such roles as Rick Blaine in Casablanca and Samuel Spade in The Maltese Falcon. Hepburn has shown us her talents with The Philadelphia Story and Bringing Up Baby. Did they ever happen to make a movie together? Yes, they did. Was it any good? You bet your ass!The African Queen is a rousing tale of adventure and romance with two unlikely companions. Bogie plays a steamboat captain who agrees to take Robert Morley's sister, The Great Kate, back to civilization during the onset of World War I. In the process, they must fight for survival along treacherous waters.The gin-guzzling riverboat captain is a great counter to the strait-laced missionary and the two stars make this a ride to remember. Besides the performances, the script probably shines the most. James Agee and John Huston, who also directed, have a great knack for writing crisp and smooth interplay between the two leads.There aren't very many supporting roles in this movie, but Robert Morley makes the best of his small performance. He's actually quite memorable and he hearkens back to supporting players of older Bogart movies like Sidney Greenstreet.Both leads received well deserved Oscar nominations and Humphrey Bogart finally won his big award. That should tell you that I'm not the only one who thought this movie was excellent. If you like stirring action with great chemistry from the stars, then you'll love The African Queen. A film that can be watched again and again for its lighthearted characters, abundant humor, and magical chemistry.The African Queen 70th Anniversary presented by TCMThis was a sleeper hit for me personally ! I neglected to see this Bogie film for years as it did not interest me.....So I thought . Boy was I mistaken . I was not expecting to have much of a reaction to this particular performance, but was surprised to have liked it as much as I did. I doubt that Bogie came into this picture gunning for an Academy Award, the performance doesn't take itself very seriously. However ,Bogie was especially impressive because it was quite a departure for him. We know Bogie can do stern preeminent motion picture \"tough guy\" with a touch of vulnerability . And after watching him brood and grimace his way through the likes of Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, it almost comes as a shock to witness Bogie so naturally comedic here. He is truly funny. Who'd a thunk? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised though because of his work in films like the Barefoot Contessa or Bogies performance in \"In a Lonely Place\". Was Humphrey Bogart's performance in the African Queen (where he won the Oscar for best Actor) his best work? It's all subjective of course. It's certainly his most-honoured work. Katharine Hepburn also matched Bogie line for line ,step-for-step. The Great Kate was tremendous. Either way The African Queen is a rollicking odd-ball adventure and I am so glad I went to see it multiple times :)",

Robert Morley has a small role at the start, and plays it to a \"T\" - setting us up for a cracking adventure yarn that ends up being the most unlikely romance you will ever see. John Huston has done a brilliant job with CS Forrester's characters - they are engaging, the trip is enthralling and the ending, though a tad predictable, brings a smile to your face.

Humphrey Bogart, plays the Captain of the \"African Queen\" - a vessel used for mail delivery before the wars begin, and catapulted to become much more when Katharine Hepburn's character climbs aboard. Hepburn plays the sister of a Methodist preacher in an African village. When the Germans burn down the village and her brother dies, she has no choice but to go with the Captain. Right off the bat we realize this is no ordinary woman - as she appears to have a lot of knowledge around hunting, nautical engineering, and guts - and immediately starts seeing how the African Queen and it's contents can help the British against the Germans in the war. The Captain has on board hydrogen, oxygen, detonators, as well as plenty of gin and tea. He appears to have been prepared for trouble in this wood-burning engined vessel. The interaction between Charlie & Ross is mature and interesting. Charlie becomes attracted to Ross because she helps him and can be his equal. This is rare in movies to see this kind of male/female interaction - especially in the 50's. John Huston showed the future of what could be if men allowed it. Ross's education and upbringing in England must have surpassed anything done in the U.S. - as women weren't even able to vote until the 1960's here. This is what makes this movie a gem. Yes - the boat and action is exciting, but the relationship is key, and this blossoming makes the movie enjoyable and watchable until the very end.",

The two main actors Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are on their own. They do so very well, especially when one takes into account that both were not so young anymore. Granted, the relationship between Bogart and Hepburn is less explosive than that between Bogart and Bacall in \"To have and have not\" (1944, Howard Hawks), \"The big sleep\" (1946, Howard Hawks) and \"Key Largo (1948, John Huston).

You make your meager living transporting people and products from one port of call to another. Suddenly, World War One breaks out, and things become a lot more dangerous. At one of your regular stops, a Christian mission run by two British siblings, you find one of them is dead and the female is all alone in the now deserted and destroyed village. You take pity on her, and offer shelter and passage on your boat. OK. This is the setup of The African Queen, and so far, I'm with the program. But then...The woman comes on board, learns from you of a German gunboat far downriver, and, lusting to exact revenge for the death of her brother, insists on the following: You outfit your boat (which happens to be your only transportation, not to mention your livelihood) with some makeshift explosives that you yourself must fabricate, take the boat downriver, through dangerous rapids, over a waterfall, past a fortified German citadel, to confront the much larger and powerful German boat. Along the way you must endure nasty weather, biting insects, leeches, danger from crocodiles and hippos, and who knows what else. If you happen to actually succeed in this wild scheme, and survive, your boat will be destroyed, and you will be left with...nothing. Of course, you may easily die at any point along the way, too. That's option \"A.\"Option \"B\" would be to politely tell this lady to shut up and sit down. You will bring her to the nearest village or anywhere in the vicinity that doesn't pose too much of a threat. If she continues to insist on her ridiculous fantasy, you will leave her on the nearest riverbank, to the mercy of the jungle.As the riverboat captain, what would you do? Pick \"A\" or \"B?\" Yeah this isn't a hard choice. If you say \"A\" you are a flat-out liar. But of course, if you choose \"B\" then you'd have a very short film. So, viewers beware. The premise of this film is utterly ridiculous, not at all realistic. I saw this years ago in my youth and remembered liking it. Having seen it again now, it does not live up to my fond memories, nor its reputation as a classic. The entire reason for the journey is just asking way too much of the viewer.Favorite scenes (for the wrong reasons): At several points the boat is shown from a distance traveling the river and rapids, and it's beyond obvious that there are two dummies/mannequins standing in for the actors. Rigid and stiff, they don't move an inch as the boat gets tossed by the river currents. It's pretty hilarious stuff, but of course it's not meant to be lol.5/10. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Nope. This will be my last time. The fact that The African Queen twice made The American Film Institute's \"Top 100 Films\" tells me the voters were drunk. It did drop from #17 in 1998 to #65 in 2007, so some of them have realized their mistake. Maybe next time, one can hope, it will drop off completely.",

It follows a couple traveling the Ulanga River with the goal of destroying a German gunboat that harassed the British.Samuel Sayer (Robert Morley) is a failed middle-aged British academic who turned to Africa as a Methodist missionary. Helping him in Africa is his sister, Rose (Katharine Hepburn), a 40-ish prim spinster Samuel considers plain. One Sunday in September 1914, during their worship service, Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) arrives in a 30-foot steam-powered boat owned by a mining company. Allnut is an uncouth 50-ish Canadian machinist who came to Africa to work on bridge construction and became a general fix-it man for the mining company. He uses the boat to get supplies and delivers mail to the Sayers. Allnut tells the Sayers that war has begun between Germany and England and that they should be careful because of their location in German colonial territory.The German Schutztruppe soon arrive and destroy the African village taking away the locals to be impressed into the military. Samuel and Rose stay, but Samuel becomes severely ill and dies. Allnut happens by and helps bury Samuel. He then offers to help Rose leave in his boat. Their relationship is very formal; he calls her \"Miss,\" and she calls him \"Mr. Allnut.\" She convinces him to take a dangerous trip down the river to try to destroy a German gunboat called the K\u00f6nigin Luise.The rest of the film follows their adventures on the river and the change in their relationship after they successfully pass a German fort on the river. The movie ends with their encounter with the gunboat and does not match the ending in the novel.\"The African Queen\" is a fabulous adventure story if you don't insist on plot reality. The chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn is amazing, and the comedic touch makes the film work.

            "review_title": "John Huston's Fun Adventure Film!",
            "content": "John Huston's The African Queen is one of those movies that you always hear about. Perhaps you have heard about it so much, you avoided the movie at all costs...much in the way that I did. How on earth could I have missed this film considering I am a major film buff and I am a sucker for these adventure stories. Also, I wonder why it took me so long because the films from the past half-century definitely considered this film a major influence. Maybe not Katherine Hepburn's finest performance, but I thought the film was fun and funny at times. Of course, why would anyone want to avoid any film with Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart?Considering the film was released in 1951, it can almost be viewed as an independent picture. Most studios passed at the opportunity to finance the movie. Producer Sam Spiegel, who produced many epics over the year, had the script in his hands and offered John Huston the opportunity to direct the film. Unlike most films made at the time, this movie was shot on location, which made it a high-risk film (which eventually did pay off). The cast and crew made this Technicolor film in both Africa and England, which is where the beautiful cinematography comes from. It was famously known that everyone got sick...that is the exception of Bogart and Huston. Bogart reasoned that he did not drink the water and only the whiskey he took with him. If you notice in the beginning where Hepburn is playing the organ, she is sweating profusely and looks ill. It turns out that she was.For the most part, the film follows two characters and is set on one location, the boat which was named The African Queen. This could have made more a complicated shoot, but Huston admirably handled it very well. Miss Rose Sayer (Katherine Hepburn) and her reverend brother are British missionaries living in Africa, spreading the word of God. This takes place during the onset of World War I, although they do not know much about it. They rely upon Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) and his steamboat for mail and supplies. Charlie is barely tolerated thanks to his alcoholism. When the Germans attack their missionary and Rose's brother died, Charlie rescues Rose. Charlie wants to hide until the war is over, but Rose is determined to attack a German battleship upriver. With these two different personalities combating each other, will they be able to survive the war...and each other?This movie gave both Hepburn and Bogart the opportunity to work with each other for the very first time. They both were excellent and had wonderful chemistry with each other. It is funny to see how excellent their performances are but are not even close to their best works. People got a shock seeing Bogart in color for the very first time and it is believed that worked positively towards his performance. Hepburn played a very determined, high-minded character and does so well. She won an Oscar for her performance.The African Queen is a simple, yet effective adventure romance story. John Huston commanded his ship very well as he does not go overboard with his directing techniques. Since the movie was shot on location, Jack Cardiff's cinematography is beautiful. Yes, that is the African sun we are seeing. I liked the film was set in the backdrop of the first World War, because it made for an incredibly thrilling end. The movie was more contemplative than I expected, so be prepared for that. Based off the famous C.S. Forester novel, The African Queen was adapted very well to the silver screen and I do recommend it if only to see the legendary duo of Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart in a movie together.My Grade: B+",

Sounds easy, but try and find all that in a Hollywood film today! I first saw The African Queen when I was just a boy. It was already 30 years old then, and dated, but its immense charm wins you over just as inevitably as that of the two main characters makes them fall for each other.Forget the impossible coincidences and holes in the plot, and forgive the politically-incorrect portrayals of the Germans and Africans (it was after all a different time, and no great offence was meant). This is a Sunday afternoon treat. Two great Hollywood icons sparring with each other on-screen - with another (Huston) choreographing it all from behind the camera. I agree with the IMDb reviewer who says it is not the classic it is often claimed to be. But it's damn good, all the same.",

Stallone uses a similar technique, but he is regarded as a failure so we don't watch his method with the same attention to detail.This movie is unique because of how it uses Hepburn, making it more useful than other Bogie films (Sierra, Casablanca) but not one of Hepburn's best. It's all straight, a manner that today's movies don't dare presenting themselves as anymore because of the audience.The way the African setting is photographed resembles Florida more than Africa.  Still, there are a few clever tricks here to bring this out of the norm, but most rely in the pacing and not the script.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material",

            "review_title": "Screwball romance for the Fifties",
            "content": "The African Queen is a unique movie in many ways. Most obviously, it's the only film where you'll find two of the greats of Hollywood history, Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, in the same film. It's also spectacular that this film was actually shot on location, except for the in-water stunts, in Africa, apparently at great hardship to the cast and crew.What I like best, though, is that \"The African Queen\" has a premise that, while not completely original (\"boat going down a river\" and its variations being a classic plot in literature and film) is off-kilter enough that it this movie is a breath of fresh air, even 60 years later.As the film opens, we meet the pure missionary Rosie (Helpburn) and the light of her life brother and fellow missionary, who dies of grief after war erupts and the Germans destroy his missionary village, in an apparent bid to conscript the natives as troops. Rosie has no recourse but to cast her lot with Mr. Allnut (Bogart), the boozing river captain and only British subject she has contact with.Then the movie unexpectedly veers into screwball comedy territory, as Rosie, the innocent missionary, decides it's their duty as patriotic English citizens to convert Mr. Allnut's capable but aged boat into a kamikaze torpedo and take out the major German gunboat in the region. This launches them on a trip down some unfriendly (unnavigable, even) waters that is more funny than scary, which ultimately ends on an absolutely screwball high note.The film is funny and breezy, with just enough of a plot and character development that what the characters are doing doesn't come off as utterly insane, which is a problem I have with some of the more \"out there\" screwballs.It should be said however that it's rather amazing that a film set in Africa, with Africa in its title, only has Africans on screen for maybe 3 minutes, and that they have no meaningful dialogue. Ah, Hollywood before political correctness! Still, this is a very fun film and an absolute must to see if you enjoy either of the leads, or, as in my case, if you're a fan of both of them.",

There is no real emotions in it and the chemistry between the two often doesn't work well.  You never get attached to them emotionally and are never scared for them, because they are somehow or another ridiculously equipped to conquer any problem they come across and any other problems, that manage to go beyond impossible, are resolved by insane events of divine intervention.  I think a lot of people mistake this for a great movie because it has two great actors and overlook the fact that they just don't work right together.In the end it had some fairly heart-warming parts and some almost sad parts (which I think are essential for a good drama).  And the actors do their best to overcome an often ridiculous script.  It is a very good movie (at times) which has gotten a little more praise than it deserves because of nostalgia factors and idolizing attachment to the actors.\nFor a great movie, check out \"White Hunter, Black Heart\" directed, and starred in, by Clint Eastwood.  It is about the director of this movie, John Huston (Wilson), and his crazy antics while filming this movie.  It is chockful of laughs and drama and is one of my favorite movies of all time.",

And it is good to see especially a woman so dirty and without makeup in a film of old days. Some technical cuts should be undone, it's better to leave those kind of scenes out than make a dull copy of natural life.

Look, I hate special effects and am not usually overly concerned about technical particulars of a film, but this  was terrible and even inexcusable for its time.

For sheer economy in casting efforts, this film is unrivalled. It is almost unimaginable for any of today's  film to be as superior a product with as few actors and special effects.

Hepburn, always respected for playing the sensible but emotionally deep woman ends up coming across as a two dimensional character infringing her beliefs while refusing to uphold them. There wasn't a moment when I believed these characters were real.  Their lame adventures were implausible helped along by luck and `The Grace of God.'   The only way that you could believe in their `Romance' was because of their absolute loneliness and inability to be tolerated by any other human beings.  This movie is so hammy that you end up hoping that they are going to die.  What is seemingly going to be a gritty look at human nature ends up looking like the Wild Safari ride.  The only things redeemable about this movie are some great shots as Bogart is dragging along the African Queen through the marsh and some cool underwater opticals.

You could\nargue that it's like a one-room play about life on a small steam boat.But the story is unusual in the dynamic and evolution of the relationship between two very\ndifferent personalities --- thrust together for days into a tiny space. What gives the story\nso much life here are the actors that provide that life.When you add the backdrop of war, patriotism, faith, and especially love ... you get a nicely\ncomplete story.ACTING:\nBogart and Hepburn play off each other well here, no, extremely well. Only because each plays\nhis / her part right to the edge do we get this beautiful shape to the \"odd couple.\"Hepburn is largely being herself, but that doesn't detract from her innate talent. Bogart is pushed\nand pulled beyond his normal \"I'm a tough guy and never show emotions\" persona. I was (am) very\nsurprised that he stretched so far.TEMPO:\nVery balanced between calm, happy, fearful, and exhilarating momentsCINEMATOGRAPHY:\nBeautiful, if you like African / tropics sort of placesDIRECTING / WRITING:\nJohn Huston ... what more to say? His skills and sensitivity were so far beyond his peers --- love (most)\nof his work, though \"Key Largo\" was somewhat lame.Note: There's an old saying the \"The fruit does not fall far from the tree,\" and it applies here considering\nhis father was Walter Huston, an amazing actor in his own right.Is it a very good film?

            "content": "Adventure. The film adaptation of the novel of the same name by the English writer Cecil Scott Forester. Since I have not read the original book source, therefore I will evaluate the picture as an independent work. And I stumbled upon the picture by chance, and decided to see for the first time on the screen the owner of four Oscars, Katharine Hepburn, and Humphrey Bogart, who I loved (who also received an Oscar for this picture). And I was delighted with the viewing, not an explosion of emotions, of course, but this adventure can not be called an average person in any way. And here's my brief opinion for you-Two in a boat, not counting romance. I did not find any disadvantages in the picture, although there is one significant remark, which I will mention below, but for now I will describe the advantages of this adventure picture with elements of melodrama.So, here they are:\n1. Scenario-East Africa, September 1914. The First World War began in Europe, which also affected the colonies. In one of them the monk lives together with his sister, they live quietly and peacefully until the Germans come and destroy the work of their whole life. As a result, the sister is forced to leave the house, and the captain of the small boat \"African Queen\", Mr. Allnut, volunteered to accompany her. Ahead of them are waiting for dangerous adventures, many obstacles and of course romance. The finale will pleasantly surprise you, although it does not carry any intrigue, the whole is guessed almost within the first thirty minutes. A pleasant romantic story full of adventures, performed by talented actors of the \"old school\", which will not leave anyone indifferent!2. Relationships - in fact, the whole picture consists of almost nothing but dialogues and relationships between the main characters - and it was possible to make it interesting, and even exciting. Their quarrels, common victories, defeats, solutions to complex problems - everything is interesting to watch and worry about them in every possible way, although we don't really know anything about their past, but we see their characters through their actions. That's right - two extreme opposites are attracted to each other and this killer couple will be able to do even the impossible. You can be sure of this! And the romantic line very smoothly lay down on the main story and looks logical, because the danger unites like none of the obstacles. The charisma of Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn play an important role here.3. Dynamics - despite the fact that almost all the action takes place on board the boat, the viewer does not have a sense of intimacy. On the contrary, you believe that the heroes really swim, and this journey does not go smoothly. Breakdowns, the actions of the Germans, the nature of Africa-all this affects the heroes, even their appearance, because we have not supermen here, but ordinary people who can be injured, who can get sick (for example, fever, which is common for Africa) and many more ways to interrupt their journey. I am sure that Spielberg was inspired by this picture when he created \"Indiana Jones\".4. Africa-filmed on location, so you believe in everything that happens. The beauty of the Black Continent pleases the eye, but they do not forget about the danger in the form of predatory animals, midges, water inhabitants. All lovers of exotics just need to see this picture.5. Music is far from a masterpiece, just an average person who gives the right mood here. For example, I barely remembered about it, because there is not a single memorable composition.6. Humor - I realized that it would be funny already in the first minutes - and the picture did not drop the quality bar, because it continued to make me laugh almost until the denouement of this story. The humor turned out to be simple and pleasant, although obvious. There is no rudeness, no vulgarity, I'm not talking about vulgarity at all, but there is simplicity and elegance - what else is needed for a good time in the company of the second half?Now about the remark. This concerns the brother of the main character-the reverend. It was somehow suspiciously quickly \"leaked\", and so idiotically, as if we were watching not a serious movie, but a modern cartoon for stupid children. I'm sorry for this comparison, but there are no other words to choose. Combined shooting and primitive special effects are not considered as disadvantages, because it was the fifty-first year.A little about the main characters:\n1. Charlie Allnut, played by Humphrey Bogart , is a cheerful and cynical captain of the boat \"The African Queen\", who volunteered to help Rosie without suspecting that this decision will change his life. He is shown as a brave and determined captain, at the same time courteous and polite, who can be a real romantic. I liked Humphrey here, because he is usually presented as a cool detective in a strict suit, but here he is a kind of\" shirt - guy\", albeit with a trademark cynicism. Bravo Humphrey!2. Rose (Rosie) Sayer, played by Katharine Hepburn , is a very pious lady who has turned from a quiet person into a smart and lively lady who motivates anyone to even the most desperate act. A brave lady, whom you admire. This is an example of a strong woman, and not what today's non-feminists represent. Catherine pleased me with her acting. I hope that she will not disappoint me in the \"Philadelphia Story\" either.The picture became a box office hit, but it never reached the Soviet audience, which is a pity, because there is practically no politics here, and I am convinced that our viewers would like an adventure story.As a result, we have a good adventure movie with romance, a good script, pleasant and high-quality humor, the real nature of the Black Continent, and with a great acting duo of Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn!My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",

For over 90 years the Liemba has been the only major means of transportation on Lake Tanganyika.

This fictional story may work as an adventurous fairytale, but the attitude problem is quite evident.

In \u0084The Mercenaries\" the Iron Cross of the German mercenary (based on actual German mercenary in the Congo, Siegfried M\u00fcller) even does get changed to a swastika. I wonder why John Houston didn't paint a swastika on the bow of the Louisa as well.Also remarkable is the fact, that the \u0084democracy\" US of A seems to adore Kings and Queens; the heroic boat of this movie is a Queen, Elvis Presley is called King, Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. do reside and reign in an aura of selfrightousness like actual aristocrats in a hereditary monarchy.",

            "content": "\"The African Queen\" belongs to that elite category of movies: CLASSICS. Released in 1951, the film stars Humphrey Bogart (who won the Academy Award for Best Actor) and Katharine Hepburn, and was directed by John Huston. It was shot on location in Africa under very difficult conditions for the cast and crew. In spite of that, Bogart gave the performance of a lifetime. Perhaps it wouldn't be fair to list the stars without including the African Queen herself, a run down old steamer that was held together with spit and chewing gum. Huston's direction was impeccable, capturing the beauty of the African jungle, the terrors of World War I, and the challenges of being a Missionary to the African natives.   Without giving away too much (there are so many twists and turns which you must discover for yourself), it is safe to say that this is a love story in the truly classical sense. It's the story of a relationship between two people that starts out of necessity and just grows and grows. It is also an \"upper\" in that by the end of the move, you have this warm and fuzzy feeling. Call me old fashioned, but I like movies that make me feel good. If you like stories that leave you feeling mad or frustrated, try watching the News. The bottom line is that whether you have just a few movies or a houseful, you MUST have \"The African Queen\".",

            "content": "Written by .. Reviewing Vincente Minnelli's 1945 masterpiece of impulsive romance, James Agee began, \"The Clock (MGM) at its best, is so good that it inspires ingratitude for not being great.\" Agee's lyrical profundity was as entertaining to read as it was astute. In an era before the endless abyss of PR shtick and kiss-ass reviews supplanted the loftier ethics of film-criticism, Agee was the high water mark. Writing for Time and The Nation only seven brief years in the nineteen-forties, he introduced the modern form of criticism still in use, and influenced generations of writers. By 1948, Agee was dividing his time between freelance journalism and screen writing. His 1949 Life magazine cover story, Comedy's Greatest Era, remains among the finest essays ever written on silent film. Agee's genuine admiration of talent, and effusively positive means of expression, resulted in numerous, abiding friendships. Only recently discovered, Agee wrote The Tramp's New World, a post-apocalyptic fantasy, for Charles Chaplin, whom he fearlessly defended during the HUAC lunacy that eventually forced Chaplin from the country. Agee wrote screenplays for two of the most enduring films produced in the nineteen-fifties, The African Queen (1951), and The Night of the Hunter (1955). The latter was directed by Charles Laughton, who lived up to his onerous reputation, and Agee's participation ended in his acrimonious departure. Laughton claimed (after Agee's unfortunate death at 45) that little of the writer's work survived in the final version of the film. The Night of the Hunter would later be considered a groundbreaking film, through its use of minimalist production design, unforgettable performances (Lillian Gish, Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters), and resonating moral message. Agee was far more successful collaborating with director John Huston on The African Queen. The film garnered several Oscar nominations, including best screenplay, and won for best actor (Humphrey Bogart). Huston and Agee, who became great friends, shared screen writing duties in the adaptation of C. S. Forester's novel. What remains clear today is the brilliance and insight with which Agee presented film analysis in a thoughtful, entertaining and informative manner, and the magic of his words on the printed page. His aspirations as a screenwriter, while depriving readers of his film criticism, were understandable given his immense talent, though unfortunate, considering his abbreviated life. Directed by ... The son of an itinerate stage actor and a newspaper correspondent, John Huston was a sickly child, dividing his time between divorced parents, bouncing from boarding school to fleabag hotel room. He became amateur lightweight boxing champion of California in his teens, and by twenty-one a lieutenant in the Mexican Cavalry. While in Mexico Huston wrote a book, it was published, and he leveraged this early success into a Hollywood screen writing contract, which eventually led to directing. His origins explain Huston's affinity for great writers. Throughout his career he collaborated with Truman Capote, James Agee, Arthur Miller, and developed films based on the works of Kipling, Melville, Joyce, and many others. Huston made his directing debut in spectacular fashion with The Maltese Falcon (1941). During his World War II military service, Huston directed a documentary account of the Battle for San Pietro (1945), depicting the conflict with such jarring reality Army censors cut it to half its original length. Even then the film evoked such a strong anti-war sentiment it remained unseen until years later. Huston's greatest success brought him two Oscars and a plumb role for his aging father Walter, as the crotchety prospector in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). Starring Huston's favorite actor, Humphrey Bogart, it was their fourth of eight films together. \"Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no stinking badges!\" Key Largo (1948) later that year was a tour-de-force for claustrophobic gangster Edward G. Robinson, with an all-star cast, again featuring Bogart, Laurel Bacall, and Lionel Barrymore. Claire Trevor won an Oscar for her portrayal of Gaye Dawn, a pathetic, over-the-hill, alcoholic gun moll. The Asphalt Jungle (1950), based on a novel by W. R. Burnett, was a noir thriller about a jewel heist gone bad, starring Sterling Hayden and Sam Jaffe. It was followed by \u0085The African Queen (1951) Wednesday, February 14, 5:00 & 7:30pm The Historic Lynwood Theater, Bainbridge IslandBased on a novel by C. S. Forester, The African Queen (1951) is the story of two irascible misfits, thrown together by adversity, forced to reconcile their considerable differences for the sake of justice and survival, who inexplicably end up falling in love. Set in Africa as the first World War begins, German troops destroy the missionary outpost of Reverend Samuel Sayer (Robert Morley) and his sister Rose (Katherine Hepburn). Their only contact with civilization is Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart), the seedy pilot of their supply boat. When Charlie finds Rose in the burnt out settlement after her brother has died, he takes her on board to avoid capture, and what begins as a plan to simply 'hide' becomes a mission of heroism. Charlie suffers Rose's starchy spinsterhood, while Rose comes to terms with Charlie's crude, slovenly behavior and drunkenness, as their humorous journey reaches its harrowing and memorable conclusion. Rarely do combinations of story, production and talent line up with results as wonderful as The African Queen. Two of Hollywood's finest actors, well into middle age, were perfectly cast as disparaged, alien opposites, with utterly hysterical and ultimately sweet results. Directed by an emerging Hollywood master, photographed by a stalwart of British Cinema (Jack Cardiff), adapted from the novel by a genius of film commentary and screen writing (James Agee), the enduring popularity of The African Queen fifty years on confirms why this film's place in American culture is as certain as water is wet.",

The love that finds Charlie (Bogart), a \"gin-drinker you (CAN) trust,\" and holy Rose (Hepburn), is a tested one, forged in fear & frustration, hammered to harmony in the heat of necessity. There are no dinner dates nor liquor to smooth the ride for \"Rosie Girl\" runs a clean ship.

I think he'd've been mortified, then proud, very, very proud of \"Mrs Allnut.\" In peace time their love would've been ludicrous.

            "content": "Having read the book, I thought at first that there were some minor miscastings of the lead roles, but the second time I watched this film, I honestly didn't care. The special effects are a bit hokey, yes, but there's some unusually good acting by the two leads (neither of whom I've ever been impressed by because I just don't think they're that good, either of them), and a good story to boot.Considering I'm not overly fond of either of the leads, it's amazing that I managed to sit through this film, where most of the film is just Bogart and Hepburn on a boat floating down the river.Katharine Hepburn might seem miscast if one has read the novel and not seen the movie, seeing as in the book Rose Sawyer is described as a voluptuous, possibly blonde woman in her thirties, and Katharine Hepburn was a tall, skinny, flat-chested redheaded woman in her forties. Katharine Hepburn is exceptionally good in her role in that she manages to convince us that she is Rose Sawyer instead of Katharine Hepburn- even if Rose is a bitty of a nutty spinster like La Hepburn herself.Bogart's slightly closer to Charlie Allnut than Hepburn is to Rose Sawyer, book-wise. True, Charlie was a Cockney in the book, and not a Canadian, but Bogart couldn't do an adequate cockney accent, so they made him into a Canadian. Because of how oddly well he and Hepburn mash together, you don't notice his short-guy complex. Despite the fact that Hepburn was somewhat taller than he (she was 5'9).Half of the film was shot on location in Africa, and half of the film was shot in a tank in a studio. You almost can't tell when it jumps from Africa to tank. Famous scenes include the bits with the gin and the leeches on Bogart, but the scenes over the waterfalls and through the currents are very well done, too, even if with some of if you can tell that they're just sitting still in front of a screen playing a video of a rushing waterfall. It's less obvious if you just don't pay attention to it.It's not the greatest film either of these two ever made, but for me, it's the most watchable and the one I'd be most likely to consider a classic (along with Bringing Up Baby and Adam's Rib for Hepburn, and Key Largo for Bogart). It's a good popcorn flick, but also a tale of triumph and love on a river in WW1. Not one to miss, unless you don't like either or both stars. In that case, you'd probably be better off just reading the book.",

In my view, however, this is in an overall assessment overrating the actual quality of the film.The photography is quite good for much of the film; there are, obviously, lots of good shots of the meandering riverine area, and some of the shots of the boat itself are done very well (such as a rotating shot of the African Queen as she is moored on the bank of the Ulanga, or a zoom-out of the boat as Rosie and Charles think they are done for while they are, in fact, very close to their destination). The script, however, can only be called mediocre at best. It remained utterly unclear to me why on Earth Charles would ever agree to the plan - his doubts about the feasibility aside, he must also have understood that even if the plan succeeded, the boat that provides his living would be lost. Yet, this and other questions about the plan are never addressed, and instead Bogart's character allows Katherine Hepburn's character to boss her around while, at that stage, she has absolutely nothing to offer that he might be interested in. Add to that a lot of overly pathetic and schmaltzy dialogue - first between Hepburn's character and her brother, later between Hepburn's and Bogart's characters -, and you get a script of rather poor quality.Some of the acting was decent. Bogart does a good job portraying a drunkard who is, much against his initial will, transformed into a hero, while Hepburn does a similarly good job at portraying an old spinster transformed into a passionate lover. It's just not sufficient to compensate for the many other shortcomings that the film suffers from.",

Much of it is quite dated, and many of the scenes featuring Bogart and/or Hepburn in front of a backdrop (onto which is projected film of the water) are embarrassingly flawed. Perhaps within a budget in 1951, that was the best they could do, but a constant mix of scenes where Bogart and Hepburn are in a REAL boat in REAL water makes these inserted scenes look silly. The movie \"Titanic\", made a mere 2 years later in 1953, had none of these technical problems.In addition, the characters were not as argumentative as I remember them. Without much conflict about one-third into the movie, there's not much place for this movie to go, except, literally, down the river.\nHowever, all that being said, it's still one of Bogart's best performances, his only Oscar, and is somehow still worth viewing.

Another reviewer mentioned that lesser actors might have brought this film easily down to a glorified travel tour, and i have to agree with that. If either role had been cast with an actor whose presence came across as weak; this would at best: be a very boring movie to watch. Fortunately, that's not the case here.

The dialogue and mood were totally inappropriate considering their dire circumstances.These old movies were made for a naive audience whereby directors and producers felt they had to sugar coat every plot and relationship.

He certainly was good, but like the rest of the film, his performance seems cornball and forced. The whole movie seemed very contrived, and Bogie's romance with Katherine Hepburn being particularly rushed, forced and silly.The scenario, the music and the bad dialogue have \"Disney\" all over it. \"The African Queen\" really plays like a kiddie film. I almost expected Bogie to start swimming with the crocs as they help him tug the boat through the reeds, and for Hepburn to break out in song with the birds. Even the rubber leeches seemed like they were going to sing an evil tune as they clung to Bogie's body.So much of the film seems way too fake as well. Maybe the worst scene was when mosquitos or whatever they were swarmed over our couple. They were very obviously only on the film's surface. When Bogie threw a tarp over Hepburn to protect her, he should have also covered a big part of the swarm too, but no.Other obviously fake scenes were poorly filmed scenes with a miniature boat, and the obvious shots where they were in front of a giant screen. Some shots in the water you could hear the echo of their speaking voices because they are in a studio tank.But not to be all negative, because it is Bogie on screen, even if he's acting silly and saying bad lines. Hepburn even looks a bit sexy all messy, and thankfully her performance is a bit toned down. There are also some beautiful location shots.Best scene in the movie is when a drunk Bogie starts razzing Hepburn a bit. Best line in the film: \"Well I ain't sorry no more, you crazy, psalm-singin' skinny old maid!\"More drunken Bogie and some singing elephants may have helped the film a bit. Glad I watched because I love Bogie, but doubt I'll ever watch it again. It makes sense that this film was a favorite of Walt Disney, because this is totally a Disney film without his name on it.",

Most movies that are based off of books never seem to live up to the title, but his film by John Huston should make C.S. Forester proud. These two opposing characters create an interesting story line as they travel down a river in Africa. One character who is prim and proper juxtaposed to one that is unclean and unshaven make the picture automatically appealing. The viewer is entranced and wants to know how the relationship between these to characters will play out. I won't give any hints, but you should find out for yourself how it ends.",

Forrester, this John Huston film (1951) written with James Agee is set in German East Africa (now Tanzania) during the First World War (1914-18) and tells a love story capturing the spirit of that period.River boatman Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) is the most unlikely suitor for dedicated missionary Rose Sayer (Katherine Hepburn) but the situation takes an unexpected turn for the worse.Rose's brother Reverend Samuel Sayer (Robert Morely) succumbs to a tropical disease and she is left alone, bereft in wartime Africa. The war, of course, is in their heads until their village is invaded and burned by hostile troops who represent the very real, but distant war that is raging in Europe.Rose is forced to act, and with only the reluctant and slightly alcoholic mailman to lean on, she embarks on a journey that neither of them are fully equipped to deal with.But an unlikely romance is sparked from these desperate circumstances and between the two of them, they launch out into an uncertain future together in the modest vessel that is the title of the film.As the film unfolds, the prim and proper Rose and the rough and ready Charlie somehow beat one another into shape like a pair of blacksmiths working red hot iron.Without any precedent in their previous lives, they both find meaning and fulfilment in one another in a situation that is truly foreign to both of them.This film is an epic adventure for everybody who doesn't live there already.",

            "content": "There was a time almost a decade ago when I began to seriously doubt that a proper Dvd version -ie. Not a bootleg- of John Huston's THE AFRICAN QUEEN was ever going to see the light of day. But in 2014, Paramount (who only recently acquired the Americas rights) officially released a digitally restored print for the public. After enthusiastically watching it, all I can say is that the long wait was worth it. The color photography by Jack Cardiff was already breathtaking in 1951; the restoration makes it even more so.When the C. S. Forester book of the same name was first published back in the Thirties, Hollywood already expressed interest in making a film version. Several notable names were tossed around to play the two leads, but nothing ever came to fruition. The rights found their way back across the Pond where Romulus Films, headed by James and John Woolf, was determined to succeed where the others failed. One step in the right direction was enticing Huston to write and direct. The filmmaker was intrigued by the challenge, and when he wrapped up THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE, he and famed critic/part-time screenwriter James Agee headed to Uganda to shape the script together, with uncredited help later by Peter Viertel.With Huston and producer Sam Spiegel in the bag, further publicity arrived when it was announced that Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn would be playing the lead characters. A lifelong city slicker, Bogey already toughed it out with Huston on location during THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, and he was dreading the idea of shooting in the jungles of equatorial Africa. But Huston and Agee fashioned such a good script that it was difficult for him to say no to. Hepburn shared Bogart's apprehensions, but ultimately she signed on for the same reason.Filming on location in Uganda and the Congo was a tribulation for the cast and crew, where much of them were sick from malaria and dysentery. Hepburn in particular was so ill during the organ playing sequence that a bucket was placed off-camera for her to vomit in between takes. Bogart and Huston were the only ones to remain healthy all throughout the African shoot due to their daily liquid diet of gin and whiskey.It's 1914 in German East Africa (present day Tanzania) where missionary Rose Sayer and her reverend brother Samuel are doing the Lord's work in the Dark Continent. Their bliss is interrupted when German forces suddenly arrive to conscript the native men. When Samuel attempts to intervene, he is assaulted and knocked down, soon to suffer a fatal stroke afterwards.Now alone in a hostile world, the only other person around representing the British Empire is Charlie Allnut, a sodden riverboat captain whose vessel The African Queen has seen better days.",

According to the script, the main character, Charlie Allnut, speaks in a broad Cockney dialect and the film's star, Humphrey Bogart, refused to do that. Before the cameras could start rolling, they therefore had to rewrite the story so that Allnut became Canadian instead.The movie takes place in 1914 in what was then German East Africa. World War I have just broken out, so Allnut persuades Rose Sayer (played by Katharine Hepburn) to leave the country and travel back to England. The only question is how long the rough-and-tumble sailor Allnut and the middle-aged spinster Sayer will be able to get along aboard his run-down steamboat.Bogart brought with him his wife, Lauren Bacall, to Africa. There she met (and began a lifelong friendship with) Katharine Hepburn.The film's exteriors were shot in various African locations, creating major problems. In addition to the intense heat, the team was plagued by multiple tropical diseases. Behind the cameras, director John Huston was forced to place large buckets so that actors could throw up between takes.But fortunately, \"The African Queen\" was a great success at the box office. In addition, Humphrey Bogart won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the cantankerous steamboat skipper (Katharine Hepburn and John Huston were nominated). Despite Bogie's long and successful career, this was the only Oscar the actor took home.Not everyone in the film crew got sick, by the way. In an interview made after he got back to America, Humphrey Bogart claimed that he and John Huston were perfectly fine during the entire shoot.

The movie starts with a very lady like Rose, sister of the local pastor, forcing \"civilisation\" onto African people. Charlie is the local smuggler, and is a quite rough man. Their friendship seems quite unlikely, and their love even more, but though diversity and a common goal, they get closer. I quite liked this movie, and I do understand why it was recommended to me.",

The African Queen is definitely one of those moderate films. A bit better than The Man Who Would Be King, a bit lesser than The Asphalt Jungle. In any case nothing to write home about. Nonetheless I was a bit disappointed. Not because it's Huston directing (he's too precarious to rely on), but because it's Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn acting. I love both of them. Like, really, adore. Especially Hepburn. It might be because of misguided romantic ideas of a lost Hollywood era. Or it might be just because I like the sight and style of them both. Anyway, both Bogart (who won his first and only Oscar for this movie and called it the best acting he had ever done) as Hepburn were not on their best. By far. Did Bogart get the Oscar because it was the first time he was seen in colour? He certainly makes a different impression when seen in colour... I liked him better in The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, The Big Sleep and especially in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Same with Hepburn, who just seems sick all the time (which she partly was during the recordings). Compared to Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelphia Story, Adam's Rib and even The Lion in Winter her acting was often annoying and laughable. I get why this movie is seen as a classic, but a classic doesn't necessarily mean a good movie. This was just okay. No more, no less.",

But I am stuck on the relationship. It just seemed wrong and, well, gross. I was told it was because they were unlikely- they weren't attractive or anything. I'll say. Humphrey Bogart's front teeth made me want to grab his neck and file them down.",

The movie does contain two clunker moments for me, the noisy stomach scene and Bogart's honking at hippos. Woke viewers may view the depiction of the local Africans as demeaning. I would counter that the scene of the young men wrestling for the remains of a cigar Bogart throws away which then draws other young men out from the church service, as guys playing around, just like they do anywhere. Robert Morley has a small role in the first act as Reverend Sayer, brother to Hepburn's character. He brings out the character's personality and humanity with much grace. The local Africans do a fine job playing the natives who are in turn, having fun at and being bewildered and terrorized by the foreigners' antics.",

            "content": "The premise is simple and time-immemorial: man falls in love with a woman, woman loves him back, they go through some hardships, which only strengthen their bond. What really makes this movie stand out, however, is its' storytelling.There are no long, meaningless scenes done just so the actor can get noticed by the Oscars committee. It is not a three and half hours long epic \"masterpiece\", so the director, in turn, can get noticed by the Oscars committee. In 105 minutes this movie manages to tell a more compelling story than most movies today do in 140, 160 or even 200 minutes. When you think back about the movie, you will think of the story. You will not think of the special effects (they are laughable), of how good the male or female lead acted (they were impeccable), of the music or some breath-taking backdrops (plenty of them). The most important part of every movie is the story, and here it takes the lead.Furthermore, none of the actors are carrying themselves with any sense of self-importance and we are talking here about Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn here, mind you. It is like acting should be - as if you, by accident, are made an unwilling witness to their twits of fate. What you see is the natural behavior of two people, who are acting in their natural way, as every unobserved person does.Last, but not least, the lightning is perfect. Even the night scenes are brighter than most day scenes in todays' movies. It probably has to do more with the way movies were shot back then, but still, it is a nice change of scenery.In conclusion, this is a movie worth watching. Hey, even the Academy thinks so too, awarding it an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Humphrey Bogart and nominating it for three more Oscars for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Katharine Hepburn), Best Director (John Huston), and Best Writing, Screenplay (James Agee, John Huston). And all this for a budget of exactly one million dollars. Leo would not get out of bed for this money. Splendid.",

The scenery, the special effects and the dialogue all combine to make this story so riveting and exciting that you feel as though you are on The African Queen alongside Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, which would have been great just to be with both those extraordinary actors. Of all the Katharine Hepburn movies I have seen, this is my favorite. It is one of the few movies she did with a truly strong plot. Many films which take place around only two characters, and virtually no supporting cast until the very beginning and very end of the film, don't do as well, but then those films weren't helmed by Hepburn and Bogart. They make this film enjoyable all on their own.If you want to see a truly well written and flawlessly acted film, see The African Queen. It'll bring adventure straight into your living room.",

            "content": "There was a time almost a decade ago when I began to seriously doubt that a proper Dvd version of John Huston's THE AFRICAN QUEEN -ie. Not a bootleg- was ever going to see the light of day. But then in 2014, Paramount (who only recently acquired the American rights) officially released a digitally restored print for the public. After enthusiastically watching it, all I can say is that the long wait was worth it. The color photography by Jack Cardiff was already breathtaking in 1951; the restoration makes it even more so.When the C. S. Forester book \"The African Queen\" was first published back in the 1930's, Hollywood expressed interest in making a screen version. Several notable names were tossed out to play the two leads, but nothing came to fruition. The rights found their way back across the Pond where Romulus Films, headed by John and James Woolf, was determined to succeed where others had failed.One step in the right direction was hiring John Huston to write and direct. The filmmaker was intrigued by the challenge, and when he wrapped up THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE, he and famed critic/part-time screenwriter James Agee headed to Uganda to shape the script together, with uncredited help later from Peter Viertel.With Huston and producer Sam Spiegel in the bag, further publicity arrived when it was announced that Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn would be playing the lead characters. A lifelong city slicker, Bogie was now a free agent after being under contract to Warner Bros for more than a decade. While he was at Warners, he'd already toughed it out in the mountains making THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, and he dreaded the thought of shooting in the jungles of equatorial Africa. But Huston and Agee fashioned such a good script that it was impossible for Bogart to say no to. Hepburn shared his misgivings, but ultimately she signed on for the same reasons.Filming on location in Uganda and the Congo was a tribulation for the cast and crew, where much of them were sick from malaria and dysentery. Hepburn in particular was so ill during the organ playing sequence that a bucket was placed off-camera for her to vomit in between takes. Bogart and Huston were the only ones to remain healthy throughout the shoot due to their daily liquid diet of gin and whiskeys. Whatever works, I guess!In case you're one of a small minority who've never heard of this classic, the story takes place in 1914 East German Africa (present day Tanzania) where missionary Rose Sayer and her brother Reverend Samuelare doing the Lord's work in the Dark Continent. Their bliss is interrupted when German forces suddenly arrive to conscript the native men. When Samuel attempts to intervene, he is assaulted and knocked down, soon to suffer a fatal stroke afterwards.Now alone in a hostile world, the only other person around representing the British Empire is Charlie Allnut, a sodden riverboat captain whose vessel The African Queen has seen better days. With his nationality changed from Brit to Canadian -to accommodate Bogart-\nAllnut is an expatriate who came to Africa to construct a bridge over the Zambezi River.....and stayed!!! Responsible for delivering the mail, he was Rose's lifeline with the outside world, but now the Germans have cut that off.",

Katharine Hepburn is a symbol of the height of Hollywood, Humphrey Bogart is a revered icon of cinema, and the film centrally features a political poke at the early stages of WWII, which was a huge plus at the time of its release, even more than now. But in compared to films throughout decades of awe- inspiring cinematic classics, \"The African Queen\" (1951, John Huston) just doesn't hold ground. The verisimilitude of Hepburn's performance as a deeply religious yet vengeful missionary relies heavily on the dirt smeared on her normally flawless face, and almost all of the other roles are occupied by C-list actors who are on that list for a reason. Bogart's performance as the rough and informal (to the point of discomfort to Hepburn's character) captain of the titular riverboat the \"African Queen\" is the only one that is truly believable, and is one of the only things I liked about this film.As an adventure film, it's expected to have adventure; which it does. But the scenes that don't are boring, and the adventure that it has isn't enough to make up for the unconvincing acting and the somewhat silly events that conspire. All in all, just not worth the time.",

Memories make for a better illusion than reality and just quite how this won awards is indicative of the sensibilities of those times still so close to the war. So a film about war must have stirred old memories and romantic illusions of those not there due to being too young. Quite how effects that are poor today seemed cutting edge then to me is questionable as a huge amount of the effects that centre around the boats activity in choppy water and esp the rapids scene consist of two rather stiff mannequins in what is evidently a empty boat and then theres the background projection with the two stars giving it their best pretend to be shaken about and filled with fear.. Yes the effects are uber terrible, the plot incredulous. This is a film that was almost certainly helped by its recognisable stars of the time, such high profile, well established and loved stars almost certainly make this film better than it has any right to be.. To today's audience who don't know them however the film doesn't fare so slovenly. Think I'll leave it there.",

So from a standpoint of psychic development and change, a new wholeness is achieved. But did we have to go to Africa and stage all those boring ordeals for this?

Another problem was Charlie McNut seemed much more goofy and incompetent once he sobered up. The real deal breaker for me was using the boat as a live torpedo on a suicide mission by somehow cutting holes in the hull and expecting to be seaworthy made zero sense. If the patrol route of the enemy craft is well established a well place IED type of mine seemed a better idea. That is what it became anyway.

The stars are well, the biggest names in Hollywood during this period. The coolest guy in the world Humphrey Bogart and greatest classic actress Katharine Hepburn collaborate in a mismatched journey out of German East Africa at the onset of World War I. The working class boat driver Charlie Alnutt, played by Bogart, contrasts in a screwball way with Hepburn's Rose Sayer, a member of the British elite. This movie has an amazing score and the music often directs the emotional dynamism in the film. In addition to the noteworthy music, no surprise in the 1950s, this film employs a lot of continuity editing. One primary example of this is when The African Queen, the actual boat on which Bogart and Hepburn are traveling, goes over a massive drop and is damaged severely. The following scene shows the pair draining the boat of water followed by a cut with continuity editing, showing the boat empty of water. Like all screwball comedies, the pair ends up together in the end despite mild turbulence. Overall, this film is a witty and fun ride through the African wilderness with two of American cinema's greatest treasures.",

They are such legends that they can make their character's love appear believable, and allow for the film to be re-watchable even today. Hepburn conveyed such beautiful emotion, whether it be the expressions on her face or the tone in her dialogue. There were some odd moments, with a cheesy line here and there at the fault of the writer, not of any of the actors. I liked the allusion to the code, while the pair were going to sleep at night Hepburn, or Rosie, hung up two blankets to hide herself from Charles. There was a lot of good in this movie, from the acting to the great editing in the use of dissolve cuts. There seemed to be many medium shots and long shots, because the backgrounds were filled with amazing views. My favorite part of this film was that it was filmed in Africa, so this allowed for the director to include so many beautiful scenic shots. The foreshadowing at the end of the film was a nice touch, as their is a shot of a sinking boat, and right before the couple were to be hanged, the ship blows up. At the end, there is a shot of a piece of wood with the name of their ship \"The African Queen,\" showing that they accomplished what they set out to do. Great film, and any film lover should watch this at least once.",

However, despite how good their acting is the love story is very stiff and seems to be a long stretch, almost as if it's being forced. The cinematography is fantastic however. I watched the Netflix version so it may be retouched but the colors and quality were fantastic. The high contrast between the bright greens of the scenery and the dark browns and grays of the boat, Charlie, and Rosie make for a beautiful setting. It emphasizes how much Charlie and Rosie stick out/don't belong in the African wilderness. I also appreciate that the sound (specifically dialogue) isn't drowned out by the non deigetic background music. You can hear both of them clearly without interfering with each other too much.",

But the way the dialogue and other things were it kinda gave the movie the feel of almost a screwball comedy. I don't think if something like this were to really happen i think they would be too traumatized to actually fall in love. Another thing that really hurt the tone was that it was in such bright color. I don't know if they just put the brand new technology to work cause they could, but i think the bright colors did not match the tone.

This demonstrates Agees admirable range as a writer and runs counter to my experience with him as a novelist (A Death In The Family), where the tone and subject matter were inversely darker than those found in this film. This film probably wouldn't have worked so well without two of the strongest possible leads to carry what is essentially a two person film, as Bogart and Hepburn are always a joy to watch.

Bogie plays a steamboat captain who agrees to take Robert Morley's sister, The Great Kate, back to civilization during the onset of World War I. In the process, they must fight for survival along treacherous waters.\n\nThe gin-guzzling riverboat captain is a great counter to the strait-laced missionary and the two stars make this a ride to remember. Besides the performances, the script probably shines the most. James Agee and John Huston, who also directed, have a great knack for writing crisp and smooth interplay between the two leads.\n\nThere aren't very many supporting roles in this movie, but Robert Morley makes the best of his small performance. He's actually quite memorable and he hearkens back to supporting players of older Bogart movies like Sidney Greenstreet.\n\nBoth leads received well deserved Oscar nominations and Humphrey Bogart finally won his big award. That should tell you that I'm not the only one who thought this movie was excellent. If you like stirring action with great chemistry from the stars, then you'll love The African Queen.",

As they escape the WWI-era Germans down the Ubangi river in Bogie's ramshackle (and titular) boat, they need to work together to overcome many challenges (an enemy fort on the shore, a series of rapids, a broken propeller, an endless shallow and muddy river of reeds).  Bogie is rather rough and loves his gin whereas Kate is prim, religious, and a bit of a prude.  But as they fall in love, they compromise - this is a gentle older person's companionate love.  And they cook up a plan to blow up a big German warship patrolling an African river.  It's fun and the music (by Allan Gray) is jaunty and almost comical at times.  Of course, Huston notoriously shot this on location and engaged in big game hunting and lots of drinking during their stay in Africa.   Lauren Bacall (who doesn't appear in the film) was along to look after Bogie who apparently hated the shoot but won an Oscar.  To my mind, The African Queen is lighter fare, potentially even for kids (who are old enough to understand war); I would have preferred things to be a bit edgier but there is no doubt that the film belongs in the canon just for the unique pairing of the stars alone.",

In the movie, \"Rose\" (Kathrin Hepburn) starts off as an uptight missionary woman, a clever but controlling woman. Throughout their ride down the river she controls everything that happens on the \"African Queen\" boat which is symbolized by her steering the boat throughout their trip and early on in their voyage by her emptying \"Charlie's\" (Humphrey Bogart) liquor into the river because he had exploded in anger and called her names in his drunken stupor. She later loosens up and reveals herself as \"Rosie\", an adventurous woman full of passion and courage and love who works just as hard for survival as Charlie does. Charlie shows himself to be an easy going guy who falls for her and agrees to go along with her wishes even if it means risking their lives. He has a double dose of courage in that he takes on all the challenges of the African jungle without complaining much and he takes on a headstrong woman and opens his heart to her. The movie's main message has little to do with Africa or the war. In fact, their rocky ride is symbolic of what happens in romantic relationships, and makes a statement that a good team is not one with perfect people, but one in which people accept each other the way they are, forgive each other and say I am sorry (Rosie later apologizes for throwing out his Gin), who know how to listen to each other, who put all their effort to help each other get out of a bad situation and who let that person steer (the boat) who has a bigger ability at saving them (or the relationship). And although their trip is full of challenges, they learn to laugh a lot and to enjoy the adventure. Because that is what decides if a relationship becomes a joyous adventure or a hard struggle: good teamwork.",

You got the white Methodist Christians putting a church in the middle of the jungle trying to put their beliefs and religion on the indigenous people. And then out of nowhere, Bogart's character comes on a rickety old boat with no inhibitions and probably a very independent man.\n\nInsane how the Germans are making the africans fight against their own people. Watching Katharine Hepburn try to get up into the boat from the water was funny. It was really nice to see how they both helped out each other as if they were in a serious relationship. So sweet to see how their relationship progresses and how comfortable they become with each other.\n\nPretty damn good effects being used that are well ahead of it's time. I really like that they filmed in Africa. \n\nOverall, pretty good adventure and romance move. Though not my cup of tea, I found the chemistry and acting interesting. The story was kind of ehh, I was basically waiting for the movie to be over. I don't see how Rotten Tomatoes could have given it a 100%, that's just ridiculous. I think a more fitting rating would be an 83%.",

Forester's 1935 novel of the same name and stars lead actors Humphrey Bogart as tramp steamer captain Charlie Allnut and Katherine Hepburn as religious missionary spinster Rose Sayer.\nThe film is supposedly set in German occupied East Africa during World War One.\nThe film begins with Rose actually married to a religious missionary in some country in East Africa. Her husband dies shortly after their village is attacked by German invaders.\nCharlie delivers the post and supplies to the village by a steam boat The African Queen.\nCharlie is a rather scruffy, Gin drinking American where as Rose is a clean living, moral, English lady.\nThe only means of escape is down river facing numerous obstacles along the route such as perilous rapids, a German fort on the bank and a gunship patrolling the lake at the end of the river.\nBogart won his sole Academy Award for Best Actor for his role.\nThe film was shot in glorious Technicolor photography that really shows the great location shoots.\nThe film has a great feel good feeling that I would recommend to anyone put off by the age of the film.",

The setting of Africa and being on this crazy boat trip is actually quite romantic. Sometimes Hepburn's character was so stubborn and uptight, but she eventually lets her guard down some and she has a good heart under it all. Bogart doesn't play his usual cooler than cool self and plays a character as cuddly as Bogart can get. They both made me laugh in this film.

As a result they decide to retaliate by using the riverboat as a weapon to try and sink a German warship. Not enough can be said about the performances from Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. I don't think I'm spoiling much by saying that over time they fall in love (you can kind of see that coming from their very first scene together because the movies love opposites-attract relationships.) What was remarkable about their performances in The African Queen is that I actually bought it. While there was indeed one moment when they suddenly began to kiss and they spoke differently to one another from then on, I actually saw the slow progression leading up to that point so they earned that breakthrough moment. It felt right, as though they were 2 people genuinely forming a connection as they struggle through this difficult ordeal. You probably couldn't get away with this in modern cinema, but it was also a treat to see this love story take place between an older couple who were covered in dirt and grime half the time. It gave the story a more authentic feeling, as opposed to the young hot bodies they would feel compelled to use nowadays.\n\nThe entire film is kind of episodic. As they travel down the river they go through one ordeal, conquer it, and then move on to the next. Some of these scenes are more interesting than others, but I have particular affinity for the ones that deepen the relationship between the two characters. One of the oddest choices that they made in the movie is that almost every sentence the 2 characters say to one another is preceded by the name (or some other title) for the person they are addressing. It just seems so strange hearing \"Mr. Allnut\" about 50 times in a matter of 30 minutes of film. It could be somewhat grating on the nerves, particularly since it's just 2 people. I think they make that pay off by having their titles for each other slowly transition into more endearing terms, but they went a little overboard. The story's conclusion also feels a bit far-fetched and convenient, but it is one of those endings that makes you all warm and fuzzy, so I don't mind. It's also worth mentioning that, considering the available technology of the time, some of the shots they captured are spectacular. There is one zoom out that is simply amazing and tells so much without using a word. Even the rear-projection backgrounds are hidden relatively well. The African Queen is a classic film that I can strongly recommend, because I think the story holds up, and the acting is just what you need in a film that is almost entirely 2 people alone floating down the river.",

Samuel Sayer (Morley) and his sister Rose (Hepburn) in the 1st Methodist Church in Kungdu, which reeks of condescending Pharisaism since none of the locals have a clue of what they are parroting, and the unhealthy allusion of them to a bunch of predators when the boat owner Charlie's (Bogart) unfinished cigarette is up for grabs doesn't ameliorate the revulsion albeit its intention of being funny, nevertheless Bogart's belly is just as musical as his singing. \n\nLuckily soon we embark on an adventure strictly includes only Rose and Charlie, it's never too late to fall in love, after the initial distinction around Rose's starry-eyed strategy, the flame of romance is kindled during a perilous passage with rapids. The thrill of riding the waves must stir up an old maiden's passion, the two-hander between Bogart and Hepburn is tremendously entertaining to watch, Bogart plays against his usual detached sangfroid, totally unreserved as a down-to-earth ilk, it is quite refreshing to know this role capped him an Oscar statue, when he imitates a roaring hippopotamus, the joy is tangible and it is a precious moment for Boart's screen image; Hepburn is at the top of her game as well, her appellation to Charlie changed from Mr. Allnut to dear is handled with a heartwarming vignette, and she is also the trailblazer who pioneers a progressive view as a fearless woman, challenges Bogart to the final assail gallantly meanwhile her tender moment with the man she loved is truly touching. The film is also a taxing endeavor in a physical sense, frowzily dressed under the sizzler, all the river turbulence they have to endure (although it is too dangerous to be shoot live on-set, the post-produced and recreated effect is just passable), slogging through the reed-rampant water area by trawling the boat manually, not to mention the fake mosquitoes and leeches (most of the crew were under the weather during the shooting). \n\nNear the coda, Houston deftly injects some gallows humor into their capture by the German navy, but the final twist is merely ludicrous, the capsize is exerted with a slapdash hurry, anyway, it is a genuine romantic exploit can woo a massive fun-seeking, love-hankering viewers plus many non-German patriots and for Huston and his team, it was a lavish hunt for novelty paid by the company and the inception of a long-standing friendship between Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn.",

After Rose's life as the maiden-lady sister of a missionary comes to close after 10 years of servitude,  she sees her one chance to live to the fullest.  Her ideas make little sense and she breaks-in her companion like one would a horse. Something that seems like love happens to them, but it is entirely situational and relies on Rose's dominating persona. All the while, Charlie is given something he believes to be a purpose. In the end, they both seem to come together and \"be in love\" due to the magic of Stockholm syndrome. As the fiim ends, they seem to have lost all semblance of self (and sanity). While I doubt the film was made with said intentions, it works as a sad commentary on repression and the absurdity of the missionaries. Once havoc hits the African village, their shallow \"care\" for the natives is not only abandoned, but completely unaddressed. This film, in my opinion, works best when viewed through modern eyes...it's real pretty though. :P",

Once you've seen the shenanigans that accompanied the putting together of this picture, it becomes all the more enchanting. (One wonders how Huston was convinced to film pieces of it in England, however, since he insisted on shooting the whole thing in Africa, and Viertel didn't elucidate that point in the film version of WHBH; if it's in the book I haven't gotten that far yet.)\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the plot (if you've been living in a cave for the last fifty years): A missionary (Robert Morley) and his strait-laced sister (Hepburn) are ministering to natives in what was known in 1918 as German East Africa (at the time of the film it was known as the Belgian Congo, and is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo... you get the idea). The village is burned down by the German occupiers, the missionary dies, and his sister hitches a ride back to civilization with the mail carrier The African Queen, piloted by the hard-drinking Charlie Olnutt (Bogey). Bogey and Hepburn, of course, wind up in a classic romance plot, fighting like cats and dogs until they wind up falling in love.\n\nThe beginning of the film is godawfully overacted, mostly by Robert Morley (but the look on Katherine Hepburn's face when she realizes the village is on fire is straight out of a bad silent film). It improves once Bogart and Hepburn are stuck on the boat; Hepburn seems to get more into character, and the chemistry between the two is fabulous. It is, and deserves to be, considered an American classic. ****",

On their journey thye battle the elements including mosquitos, leeches, rapids and marshy waters. As often is the case in the movies, proximity sparks romance. The plot is rather simplistic and is more about watching this couple survive on an African river. There are no interesting twists in the plot like Anaconda (1997), where the characters go crazy or start turning on each other or anything like that. The movie does have some nice nature photography for the parts filmed on location in Africa, which was probably innovative when the movie came out. This isn't my favorite Bogart role, as I prefer seeing him in more dapper roles, for lack of a better word, like in \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941) or \"Casablanca\" (1942). But this movie does show his ability to play diverse roles, and he did win the Academy Award for Best Actor for this film.

            "content": "\"This boat's only big for the two of us.\"\n\nThe American Film Institute named Humphrey Bogart the greatest film actor of all-time. For the greatest actress, the AFI gave that title to Katherine Hepburn. But what happens when you put two highly acclaimed stars, put them in a film made by John Huston (of Maltese Falcon fame) about an unlikely couple teaming up on a boat? Well, what comes out is a delightful, funny, moving, touching, and wonderful drama/comedy/adventure, whatever you call it.\n\nKatherine Hepburn plays Rose Sayer, who lives in Africa during WWI with her missionary brother (Robert Morley). Humphrey Bogart plays Charlie Allnut, the captain of the steam boat The African Queen, who regularly provides African villagers with supplies. When Germans destroy the village and lead to the mad death of the missionary brother, Rose teams up with Charlie and together, ride the African rivers in the boat. At first, Rose can't stand Charlie's ugly looks and drinking problems (in this case, gin), but as the voyage progresses, the two start falling in love and work together to survive the waters and develop ideas to destroy German ships.\n\nJohn Huston is one of my all-time favorite directors, making such classics as The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Key Largo. The African Queen, on the other hand deserves to join the Huston classics list. Why? Cause it's just so fun to watch.\n\nThe African Queen was an introduction to many involved, particularly Huston and Bogart, to the world of Technicolor. The colors are simply beautiful. What helps is the great decision of Huston deciding to film it in Africa itself. The result are colors that wow in every shot and cinematography that takes the breath out of every individual who watches. I particularly enjoyed looking at shots of some of the creatures in Africa; the crocodiles, the hippos, and some deadlier than others.\n\nEveryone knows how talented of an actor Humphrey Bogart is. Bogart delights in films like Casablanca, and even some of Huston's other works that I've already mentioned. Bogart won an Oscar for his role as Charlie the crazy captain of the African Queen, and it's well-deserved. When you think of a good romantic partner for Bogart, you instantly think of ladies like Ingrid Bergman or Lauren Bacall, but here, that lady is Katharine Hepburn. Thankfully, Hepburn is not a miscast and her chemistry with Bogart is strong. I enjoyed the comedic remarks at each other and the romance delivers. \n\nOne little thing against this film, and it's that there's not a huge cast to praise. There's only Bogart, Hepburn, and Robert Morley as the missionary, but Morley was only in the first ten minutes. The best movies have big casts in them, but The African Queen has too few stars. I know I'm knitpicking, but it really bothered me.\n\nI enjoyed the adventurous story, especially in the last 30 minutes or so, where the couple has to survive the jungles. I loved the romantic and comedic aspects of the film. I was wowed by the glorious colors seen in the film. While I was displeased with a lack in a giant cast, which I'll probably have negative votes on, the story and Bogart and Hepburn's performances make up for it, making The African Queen a classic worth watching. While Casablanca and Bringing Up Baby are definitely the definitive films from Bogart and Hepburn, putting the two together was a smart idea, and Huston delivered in making The African Queen a fun film.",

And is also clearly done on a low budget, and yet it still hits its entertainment value well.\nThe story in The African Queen is a simple one about an adventure two characters embark on, and it truly has the feel of a classic adventure theme since the atmosphere is intense at times and the musical score feels really convincing to the jungle adventure genre that the film entails. It's not hard to see what makes The African Queen a classic.\nThanks to John Huston's direction it all feels very genuine. The adventure proves to he an interesting one and even a thrilling one in The African Queen, and it is full of fine quality cinematography and beautiful scenery which makes it feel like a real story, even on such a low budget. John Huston's direction proves to carry the thin story in The African Queen a long way, and he makes it a memorable visual experience.\nAnd combined with C. S. Forester's own screenplay adapted on the novel he wrote himself, there ends up being plenty of cleverly conceived material for the cast of The African Queen to work with.\nHumphrey Bogart is at some of his most playfully energetic as well and dedicated in The African Queen, and even though his performance isn't the most sophisticated of his career, it still has an amiable charm of life to it in the line delivery he gets right at every second and his iconic smile. Humphrey Bogart carries the story in The African Queen well.\nKatharine Hepburn's charm is tenacious as usual in The African Queen, and she has a marvellous spirit and strength to her ensures that Rose Sayer is a fiercely confident character who convincingly charters the waters with  Charlie Allnut in The African Queen. Katharine Hepburn's dedication to character pays off once again, and she proves to work alongside Humphrey Bogart greatly. Her performance is the true greatest of the film and it's some of her most energetic acting, both emotionally and physically.\nThe chemistry between these two is appealing because there is always a special romantic and dramatic tension between them as they are both aged people taking a journey together which becomes a life changing adventure. Considering that they are considered to be the all time greatest male and female actors, it is no surprise that what happens between them is full of charisma and passion which makes them an amiable duo for The African Queen. The two of them together make a great team and it makes the story of The African Queen very compelling and entertaining to watch, if for nothing else then solely to watch two legendary actors go at it together in an adventure and love story.\nPeter Bull's brief role proves effective as well.\n\nSo The African Queen is a classic example of a jungle adventure film which has a simple story and an extremely dedicated duo of leads.",

It has the distinction of being one of those classic films that very film fan has to see. On top of that, it stars Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn and is directed by John Huston. So there's really nothing to deter you from wanting to watch it.\n\nWhen WW1 is launched, a missionary living in Africa with her minister brother, must leave with a rugged, riverboat captain; after her village is destroyed by German soldiers and her brother dies. Rose wants Charlie to go down the river, which worries Charlie a great deal because as he says, there's only death down the river. He reluctantly agrees and the river, as well as a German U-Boat create many obstacles for the missionary and alcoholic captain.\n\nThe African Queen wasn't the irrevocable masterpiece a expected, but nonetheless it is still a very good film. I wasn't blown away by anything that the film did, but it was undeniably entertaining and well constructed, written, directed, and acted. The African Queen is a film that needs to be seen by all film buffs.\u00a0",

After the brother dies, hard-drinking stubbly sailor Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) comes in and agrees to take Rose down the river. Along the way, they bicker about various things (she's disgusted by his drinking, he finds her too pious), but they grow to respect each other.Bogart and Hepburn pretty much play their usual roles, and the movie also stars a few crocodiles (most of the movie was filmed on location in Africa). The portrayal of the German army certainly seems to be an allusion to the Nazis. But overall, the movie is quite admirable, with Rose's and Charlie's personalities bouncing off of each other. It's like an early buddy comedy, even though it's serious.",

Together they take on the dangerous task of going down the river in order to sink a German ship. At first they are both at odds with each other and struggle to cope with their situation. However, with no one else to turn to, over time, they become close. Their bond is so great that they are willing to die rather than to be separated.

Adapted from the popular 1935 C.S. Forester novel, \"The African Queen\" showcases an early 1900s East African scene in the beginning of the World War I German occupation. Humphrey Bogart earned his gold starring as a man's man of a goofball river boat captain who picks up a stranded English missionary (Katherine Hepburn) after the village she was helping is decimated. Together they embark on a mission down the windy African rivers where they fight off the elements, the enclosing Germans, and their cheeky feelings for one another. All of this culminating with the task of turning the captain's boat, \"The African Queen\" into a large torpedo aimed directly at an enemy warship that is stalking one of the larger lakes in the area. . . For its time, the film is one helluva spectacle and sported some of the early stages of when films were transitioning to color. This obviously enhanced the main point of the film, which was to really show off the wonders of the African jungle. What really stole the show though was ol \"Bogie\", who usually so calm and charming, turned himself into the most likable \"Gilligan\"-esque dweeb ever to navigate such a treacherous scene with a damsel on his arm. Hepburn reciprocates this by portraying the sheltered church girl awakened by adventure and acts accordingly in a just as awkward way. They swoon for each other the way a child goes for their teddy bear. It's innocent and trades off with sweet as well as cheesy with just a hint of danger to keep the audience guessing. . . \nHumphrey \"Bogie\" Bogart's Grade: B (I still prefer him in the more suave roles)\n\nFilm Grade: B",
