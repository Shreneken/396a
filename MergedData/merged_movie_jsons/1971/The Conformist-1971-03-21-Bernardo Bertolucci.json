            "content": "A weak-willed Italian man (Jean-Louis Trintignant) becomes a fascist flunky who goes abroad to arrange the assassination of his old teacher (Enzo Tarascio), now a political dissident.The film is said to be a case study in the psychology of fascism: Marcello Clerici is a bureaucrat dehumanized by a dysfunctional upper class family and a childhood sexual trauma. Political philosopher Takis Fotopoulos calls the film \"a beautiful portrait of this psychological need to conform and be 'normal' at the social level, in general, and the political level, in particular.\" I loved it. I think it was very symbolic of not just fascism, but politics and humanity in general. There really is a desire to conform, and normality varies based on when and where you live. Political ideas might seem weird in one place and not another. The same with morality. Could a society exist where the removal of your friends is just a part of life? Sure. (The Mafia does it.)",

            "content": "Bernardo Bertolucci's stunning early-1970s classic looks absolutely beautiful nearly forty years later. It tells the story of a fascist in 1930s Italy who is assigned to root out and assassinate anti-fascists. As the story develops, we learn that a childhood event played a large role in shaping this man's perception of himself, and that the life he is leading is largely a lie.The story Bertolucci tells is odd and compelling, but what kept me glued to the television screen was the film's mesmerizing visual style. Bertolucci collaborated with cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, and it's not an exaggeration to say that they create some of the most beautiful images I've ever seen in a film. One might expect Bertolucci to adopt a sombre color palette for telling such a gloomy story, but that's not the case. On the contrary, he opts for lush colors, striking contrasts, and stylized lighting to create a slightly surrealistic environment that's one small step removed from reality as we know it.A truly remarkable movie.Grade: A+",

            "review_title": "An unforgettable masterpiece. Finally available on DVD!!!!!!",
            "content": "American film audiences have rarely had the opportunity to view Bernardo Bertolucci's The Conformist in its original widescreen, non-dubbed theatrical release version. Although a restored print of the film has recently been shown at American film festivals, The Conformist remains unavailable on DVD. Its faded, butchered, and dubbed VHS/laserdisc release is long out-of-print, just about impossible to find, and a desecration not worth viewing in any case. Fortunately, I happened to view (and videotape) a widescreen, non-dubbed print of the film shown some years ago on a cable premium movie channel. No film lover should pass up an opportunity to see this film in any form approaching the director's intentions.A comparison of Bertolucci's The Conformist with the novel by Alberto Moravia from which it was adapted illuminates much about the ambitious style and structure of the film. For instance, Bertolucci chose not to follow the novel's omniscient point of view. Instead, he uses the intensely subjective and heavily unreliable point of view of the story's main character, Marcello (Jean-Louis Trintignant), a child of decadent aristocracy who embraces fascism, not from ideological commitment but from a desire to blend in with his social surroundings. Bertolucci also structures the film's plot in a non-linear manner rather than emulating Moravia's chronological narration. This strategy yields a film equivalent of the modern novel's characteristic \"stream-of-consciousness\" technique, whereby the inner workings of Marcello's mind, his desire for \"normality\" at all costs, are plumbed in a fragmented series of recollections held together by psychological association rather than direct cause and effect. Bertolucci's approach transforms Moravia's rather conventional, socio-political novel into a much more intimate and complex psychological study of the protagonist. The film's subjective point of view emotionally intensifies the formative and revealing experiences of Marcello's life such as his encounter as a young man with a male seducer, his shamed alienation from his parents, his deliberate courtship of and marriage to a shallow bourgeois young lady, and his ambivalent relationship with his anti-fascist former professor and the professor's liberated, bisexual wife. Two plot alterations from the novel are also worth noting. One is in the manner and location of the assassination of the professor and his wife, which occurs much more matter-of-factly in the novel. Bertolucci changes the setting to an isolated, snow-covered stretch of countryside where Marcello witnesses the execution and, by doing nothing to prevent or protest it, becomes morally complicit in the act. A second change involves the plot outcome for Marcello himself. Whereas in the novel Marcello and his family are killed by Allied bombing while attempting to flee Rome, the film's ending is much more open and ambiguous. Technically, The Conformist's indisputably brilliant cinematography, directed by Vittorio Storaro (Apocalypse Now), combines with some of the finest low budget set decoration in film history to poetically evoke a 1930s European setting that seems simultaneously real and surreal. Such scenes as the blind persons' ball, Marcello's meeting with his father in a stadium-like insane asylum, his walk through the Italian fascist government building, and the justly famous low-angle shot of blowing leaves are either hauntingly lyrical or startlingly nightmarish or, often, lyrical and nightmarish simultaneously. Many shots in the first two thirds of the film are skewed by slightly oblique camera angles to suggest that we are seeing a reality shaped by Marcello Clerici 's selective, distorting memory. This visual style radically shifts once the climactic assassination takes place and Marcello's consciousness is absorbed entirely into the film's present time. George Delerue's musical score and other elements of the soundtrack also greatly enhance the wonderfully nuanced mood shifts within and between the complex narrative strains of the plot. Quite simply, The Conformist is an unforgettable masterpiece of the highest order.",

            "content": "Set in 1938 as it follows the title character (Jean Louis Trintignant), a Fascist operative in Mussolini's Italy, is given orders to travel to Paris and assassinate his former school teacher. Trintignant is trying his best to fit into the society of his day: working for the ruling party and marrying a pretty, if vacuous, girl (Stefania Sandrelli) from a respectable family. Things become more complicated when he meets his target's new wife (Dominique Sanda) with whom he falls immediately in love. Will he carry out his orders, even if it means hurting the new woman in his life?My description makes the film sound rather banal and cliched, but it's anything but. The style of this production is impeccable, and the cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is excellent. There are countless moments throughout the film that could easily be paused and framed as works of art fit for a gallery. Each shot is carefully set-up and arranged, and the camera movements add to the visual flow of the story. Storaro, who would go on to shoot films such as APOCALYPSE NOW, REDS, THE LAST EMPEROR, and DICK TRACY, deserves a spot in the list of greatest cinematographers for this film alone. The score by Georges Delerue is also excellent, as is the costume and production Design. I also liked seeing Gastone Moschin, who played Don Fanucci in THE GODFATHER PART II, in another role, here as a fellow fascist operative.The narrative is very complex, and can be a bit confusing at first. Scenes jump across many different times in the protagonists life, with little warning, and the audience must pay close attention or be lost, especially in the first 40 minutes or so. I think seeing this on the big screen would eliminate much of this possible confusion. For me, though, it never reached the point of annoyance, and I was able to follow along with no trouble.",

The brilliant story telling of the young and passionate Bernardo Bertolucci remains as vivid and powerful as the first time I saw it - 15 years ago, when I was 21 - The film is 41 years old now and I can only imagine the effect it had in its day. For me, it became a point of reference and to see it again is a shattering scramble of emotions. Jean Louis Trintignat is extraordinary and Stefania Sandrelli is superb as the mediocre, petite bourgeois wife. The art direction by Ferdinando Scarfiotti and the photography by Vittorio Storaro are, quite simply, without equal. I was very moved by the appearance of Pierre Clemeti as the ambiguous Lino.

Manganiello is driving him tracking Luca and his wife Anna. The movie has various flashbacks of his life. He is disliked as a child by the other kids. Chauffeur Lino befriends the kid but then makes a sexual advance on him. He take Lino's gun and shoots wildly presumably killing Lino. In another series of flashbacks, he is getting married to Giulia and keeps a lot of his life secret from her. They go to Paris on their honeymoon and befriend the Quadris. After the war, Marcello meets up with Lino once again.The conformist is a nice way to describe the lead character. He is a man with no convictions. He is damaged and weak. It's hard man to care about but still fascinating. The start of the movie does lack clarity. I would like the flashbacks to not switch back and forth so much in the beginning. Director Bernardo Bertolucci has a great eye and this is filmed beautifully. The ending is so powerful. Marcello had been holding back until he finally explodes. In that one instant, the audience glimpses his true self.",

He is ordered by a Fascist organization he joined to become normal, to conform (he's gay and ashamed of it). He takes his annoying wife (Stefania Sandrelli) with him...only to find his professor has married a former love of his (Dominique Sanda). Can he kill them both? This film is just riveting. The story is never boring and full of some very intriguing people. The acting is superb--especially by Trintignant who you see holding his fear and indecision inside and Sanda who is unbelievably sexy...and dangerous. I don't know much about politics so I'm not going to discuss that.But this film is a must-see for the incredible cinematography by Vittorio Storano and masterful direction by Bernardo Bertolucci. The sets are exquisite--every single one looks incredible and is beautifully lit and shot for maximum impact. Sometimes I was just so caught up in the visuals I lost track of the story! Every shot is filled with rich symbolism. My favorite sequence was at a dance hall when Trintignant is \"caught\" in the dance. Also some prints are missing a 10 minute \"Dance of the Blind\" that was cut from original prints. It's no loss--it adds nothing to the story. Quite simply one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen with a strong, intriguing plot. A powerful must-see film. A 10 all the way.",

            "content": "It's a fascinating blend of tense character study, torn love story, and a background loaded with subtext and history that writer/director Bernardo Bertolucci brings with The Conformist. But through the entire length of the film, even if you're not totally vested in interest in the main character (who, indeed, is meant by design not to be a 'likeable' protagonist), the look of the film, its sweep and style and what most great movies do- sucking you in on the side of composition, mood, and music- is worth recommending.The film stars Jean-Louis Trintignant, an actor with a cool exterior but something very uneasy underneath the surface in almost all of his scenes (which perfectly suits the character he plays). Based on Alberto Moravia's novel of the same name, Marcello Clerici is a fascist, or at least part of the fascist 'clique' of sorts in late 1930's Italy. He's a secret officer who gets assignments to track people down and either kill, or collaborate as it were. He has some skeletons in his closet, to be sure, and in one of the most striking and powerful scenes of the film, he recalls a particular incident in his youth that stayed with him, if only in the back of his mind (I won't reveal it, but it comes as something of a shock, not so much in its outcome, but how Bertolucci approaches directing the scene with the Chauffeur and the kid).Going along with this sort of 'clique' that Marcello sticks in, he has a young wife, who loves him but is not really his equal on any sort of intellectual or even emotional basis. The actress playing her, Stefania Sandrelli, conveys this mostly 'ignorance is bliss' attitude that helps the film allow some lighter-than-air moments (i.e. the 'Dance of the Blind' sequence, a masterstroke to be sure). For some reason or another, which does become more obvious as the story goes along (and ties into this non-linear structure Bertolucci works with intelligently), Marcello seeks out and visits his old Professor, an anti-fascist, and his beauty of a wife, whom he becomes somehow smitten with (the two character actors in the parts, Enzo Tarascio and Dominique Sanda respectively, hit all the right notes, even with the subtext of scenes).After the sort of climax to all this, we move ahead several years later, when Mussollini is gone from power, and there is one last scene with Marcello that really made me sit up and take notice. I'm sure Bertolucci was fairly faithful to the original text (having not read it I can't say for certain), but he keeps a challenging ending for the audience- a lessor filmmaker might have Marcello come to some kind of clean-cut catharsis in the wake of the end of fascism. Bertolucci doesn't have that, and he and Trintignant keep it true to the character and his personality, which sort of brings to a head not so much a story resolution, but just one of something simpler about society- what does this sort of upper-class conditioning do to a person after a while, especially if there is this certain level of detachment that Marcello has. In the end, he's truer to the film's title than anything of his own real 'beliefs'.But going aside from the solid philosophical &/or political debate that could go on from the themes raised in the film, going back to the pure film-making aspect of The Conformist, one can sort of sense this as being like a 'test-run' of sorts for Bertolucci to work solely with the masterful Italian cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (of Apocalypse Now fame) for their following masterpiece, Last Tango in Paris. In some small ways, at least for Storaro, The Conformist paints even richer details and strokes of light and dark and shadow than in Last Tango. And the two have a sense of not sticking directly to one set way of filming either, which is very good. There will be a scene like when Marcello and the Professor are talking in the Professor's office, and Marcello pulls the shades down completely on one window and leaving the other open. This creates a stark, almost baroque contrast between the two of them that works well just for mood if nothing else.Then there is also the factor of how Bertolucci gets his camera moving, often in urges that would seem unnecessary or too 'artsy' for other filmmakers- the dance scene, for example, brings a viewer to move with the dancers, but ever so slightly, and then the frame is filled with these moving bodies and it's a truly virtuoso sequence. Even a scene that might be fairly standard for say an action film director, when the chase through the snow covered forest happens, the use of the hand-held camera isn't going too cheesy- if anything it really heightens all the tension that has been building since the start of the film (most of the time the camera's on dolly tracks or some other form, then it switches and it adds a different sort of intensity to the proceedings). Although Bertolucci and Storaro won awards from the National Society of Film Critics, I see it as a fairly big snub on the Academy's part to not have given Storaro a nomination.On top of that, there's other factors that add to the collaborative effort of Bertolucci's success: there's the emotionally excellent Georges Delerue score, and Ferdinando Scarfiotti's cool production design (later also a production designer on Last Tango). In the end, along with the technical side, it's also the story, and the character(s), that add to the appeal of the Conformist. It's a lot to take in on a first viewing, but it doesn't disappoint for the fan expecting good things from the young Bertolucci.",

Their cooperation seems to pay off very well (Novecento (1976), Last Emperor (1987)) as they apparently enhance each other's work. With their brilliance they almost turn Marcello into a hero, while he is actually an anti-hero in this non-linear story. It's not only an entertaining personal tragedy, it's also a political thriller with very distinctive music. I couldn't imagine life without Il Conformista anymore (like Amarcord and some other masterpieces).Always beautiful, never sentimental: poetic from minute to minute. The compositions, lighting and camera-movements made me breathless: I've never seen so much poetic power in one film. Watch for instance the camera's movement to behind the tree when Manganiello searches for Marcello in the small park @ 68 min. And for instance the hand-held scene near the end. Or the camera placements when Marcello comes approaches his mother's house. Actually the entire film is a big poem. See for yourself :-)I was lucky enough to see this one in a theater just two months after seeing it first (dec 2000). If you have the chance, go see it on a big screen. If you like the looks of this you will probably like 'Una giornata particolare' (1977) and 'Amarcord' (1974) too.Why o why can't we vote 11 :(",

They are placed theatrically at times creating a balance of space. The Conformist is the most stunning film visually I have ever seen. Every scene is immaculate, kind of surreal, almost to rich for the senses to take in one viewing.The story is somewhat difficult on the first viewing but one can figure the basic plot line. It is a story about repression and oppression, about nationality, political beliefs during a paradigm shift. It is about acceptance and avoidance. It is about playing it safe in a time of tension.The final scene suggests what the main character might have become had he chose the truth. It is left up to us to judge him and realize that it is sort of a catch 22; either way, he would have ended up in that dark place where a fascist country would mentally place same sex love.See this film to see the potential of the beauty of film.

            "content": "What I like most about this film is its visual style, owing to great art direction, and great color photography from famed cinematographer Vittorio Storaro. In particular, those huge, empty rooms; those tilted lines; that expansive outdoor platform with the Eiffel Tower in the background; that indoor restaurant with its red-outlined windows are all examples of places in the film that make a profound impression on the eyes. The stunning visuals are helped along by a galloping score, and by terrific 1930's music, especially the song \"Whose Happier Than I?\"By contrast, I found the film's story to be less interesting. Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is a weak-willed man who feels different from others, in part because of an unfortunate childhood experience. His aim therefore is to be like everyone else, or at least to convey publicly an \"impression of normalcy\". Toward that objective, he becomes a fascist, a popular political brand in 1930's Italy. He journeys to Paris, where most of the story is set. The film's theme is very political, and wonderfully anti-fascist.While the film's underlying concept is intriguing, the plot is dense and convoluted. It is helped not at all by jarring editing, and by a screenplay structure that relies too much on flashbacks. Further, most of the characters are not very likable. Marcello himself is both dull and too passive. His love interest is Giulia, a shallow, giggly young woman I found annoying. I did like the reference to Plato's Cave, a metaphor that directly relates to Marcello's predicament.As a result of the cinematography and the cold weather, the tone of the film is generally bleak and dreary, consistent with the mindset of the film's protagonist. This is not a movie to watch when wanting to feel cheery or upbeat.Because \"The Conformist\" is set in a bygone era, the story may not appeal to some viewers. However, its valid historical perspective adds depth to our understanding of twentieth century European politics. And with its great cinematography, art design, period piece costumes and background music, the film is worth at least a one-time viewing.",

            "content": "The Conformist is probably one of the most famous foreign films of all time; it's pretty much impossible to read anything about Italian, art, or world cinema without Bertolucci and especially this feature being mentioned. It's a masterpiece of stunning photography, deep acting, powerful direction, and has a respectable theme about the analysis of what leads people to become people like fascists.Made in the late 60s and released in 1970, The Conformist fit in well with the inquisitiveness and anti-authoritarian ideas of the time. Bertolucci adds to the drama by bringing in different levels of analysis, most notably psychoanalytic and homophobic readings of the nature of fascism. In those regard, including the cinematography, this movie is wonderful.I don't entirely agree that this movie is that well written, however. Many people have stated that sometimes the imagery in this movie is so powerful that the plot and details start to take second place, and it's true... this movie, despite it's strong thematic elements, is mostly visual splendor. Sometimes the magnificent photography doesn't really have much to do with what is going on in the story, and not all that happens in the story is that well done.Bertolucci is known to add passion and romance to his movies, but his ideas of love, passion, and even obsession never ring true to me. In this case, Marcello falls in love with a one Anna Quadri, and his relationship with her is supposed to represent his chance to break out of his conformist tendencies and for once in his life follow his real desires. Unfortunately, Anna is not only an unlikeable character, but it never even really feels like Marcello really likes (loves) her. The romance between these two people is illustrated by highly unbelievable \"sensual\" moments that try to be profound, but hardly are even accurate. The scene of Anna's death is a gripping, powerful moment, but still I can't help but feel like it doesn't matter anyway. An unlikeable character is betrayed by a man who is unable to stand up for his desires for someone he doesn't actually like.Taking on Bertolucci's sensual style is probably like trying to nail a door into its frame with a banana, but having seen quite a few Bertolucci films so far, I've got to say that he's much better with mise-en-scene and cinematography than writing. By the end of The Conformist, when Marcello is even unable to stand up for his previous conformist principles, the imagery still dazzles but the characterization is dead. This highly famous film has the ability to cement itself in one's memory due to the photography, but the characters and story are ultimately forgettable. \"The imagery is so powerful, sometimes you forget the story.\" --PolarisDiB",

Same thing with his controversial \"Last Tango in Paris\": other than Marlon Brando's devastating performance, which will always be a must-see for those who admire raw acting, the film's daring (for its time) approach to sexuality is now outdated, and the film is rather dull in its apparently liberal speech (the fact that I'm not exactly a Maria Schneider fan doesn't help). And last night, I finally watched the extraordinary \"The Conformist\", arguably his masterpiece and undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made.Based on a novel by Italian author Albert Moravia (who also wrote the novel that inspired Godard's \"Contempt\"), \"The Conformist\" is the story of a closeted homosexual, Marcello (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who becomes a fascist yes-man, marrying a clueless girl, Giulia (Stefania Sandrelli) and going to Paris for their honeymoon. Marcello's bosses ask him to kill his old college mentor, Quadri (Enzo Tarascio), an anti-fascist who fled Italy to live in Paris with his young, beautiful and idealistic wife, Anna (Dominique Sanda). Anna and Marcello are former lovers, but that's not the only pitfall in Marcello's plan, nor is it stronger than his tragic conformism to an exacerbated political regime and the fear of living as a \"pederast\"/having his homosexuality made public.The political factor is an open part of the plot, while Marcello's sexuality is very ambiguous (he seems to have real feelings for Anna, yet a childhood trauma and a homophobic attitude show his tragic character formation). \"The Conformist\" works as a riveting political thriller and a haunting character study, and it's impossible to praise this film without mentioning Vittorio Storaro's breath-taking cinematography, possibly his greatest (and that's saying a lot) and certainly one of the very best in film history. The whole film is so beautifully shot that every scene seems to be taken out of a painting; it could perfectly be photographed now rather than 38 years ago and it wouldn't look any better. The performances are all magnificent, particularly Trintignant, Sandrelli and Sanda, each perfectly portraying blind rage, ignorance and idealism, respectively. All in all, as close to perfection as film-making gets, and as timeless as its main themes (politics, conformism and sexuality) - if you think this couldn't happen today, take a look around and tell me how many gay Republicans you know? 10/10.",

But deeper threads run deeply through the picture; it is an examination of one man's attitudes towards the value of patriotism, love, family, marriage, sex and death, and, as has perhaps been overstated (by both the critics and perhaps the film-maker) it also explores the ramifications of homosexual repression.Bertolucci expertly manages to weave these themes into a hypnotic, occasionally  surreal experience that has served as an inspiration for countless directors.Performances are brilliant throughout.  Dominique Sanda is one of the most engaging and sensual women to ever grace the screen.See this film, and you will simply wish to see it again.",

            "review_title": "The dangers of conforming, according to Bertolucci",
            "content": "Director Bernardo Bertolucci was on to something when he directed and wrote Il Conformista/The Conformist in 1970. It's a political thriller of sorts, dealing with the fascist politics of Italy around 1938. More than that, however, it's a psychological examination of one man's mind, Marcello's. The film traces the important events of his life, how sexuality and violence traumatized him, and how it all led to him being desperate to conform to whatever seems popular at any given time. The desire to be normal is something we're all familiar with, but Il Conformista pushes this phenomenon to its most psychologically extreme form.The story begins in 1938 in Paris when Marcello (Jean-Louis Trintignant), sitting on his hotel bed, is called by his employer, a member of the Fascist secret police, telling him the plan's about to go enter the final stage: the murder of a college professor who's fled Italy when the fascists took over. To make matters more interesting, the professor is an old acquaintance of Marcello's. He gets in the car with a colleague and together they chase down the professor. The film then flashes back to other crucial parts of Marcello's life to show how he became the man he is today. Every once in a while, the film goes back to the present, with Marcello sitting in the backseat while his colleague chases after the professor. Though to say too much would be spoilerish, flashbacks include an early one when where Marcello is bullied as a child and saved by chauffeur Lino. He takes him to a mansion where he shows him a gun and then tries to seduce him. Marcello seems to give in to his advances, but then takes the gun and kills Lino in a hail of bullets. Other flashbacks show his attempts to join the fascist secret police and his attempts to be normal. The only reason he wants to marry Giulia is because he thinks she's as plain as can be, a typical normal wife that all of society can accept. The entire film thus leads up to the point where Marcello and his colleague give chase to the professor.I've always considered Il Conformista to be more of an incredibly subtle horror film than a drama or a thriller. Obviously, the film isn't a typical horror film, but it is horrifying in terms of its psychological portrayal of Marcello. This is particularly apparent in the film's climax in regard to the professor which even now is hard to stomach. The number of ways in which that scene is horrifying is something no typical horror film comes close to achieving, because it's not about physical violence so much as it is about the emotional violence inflicted on a fellow human being. It's hard to explain. You have to see it to believe it. There's something quite threatening ingrained in every single scene which is ironic, because the film looks absolutely stunning. Here's where Bertolucci and legendary cinematographer Vittorio Storaro's achievements come into sharp focus. First of all, they emphasize the Fascist art style during the scenes where Marcello's in the vicinity of Fascist government buildings. The architecture is easily recognizable with its emphasis on the color white and sharp angles. It's very suggestive of old German propaganda films. On the other hand, the film's color scheme is very lush which contrasts with the physical and emotional violence taking place.The way the story is set up is absolutely wonderful and there are little things that tie several events together quite nicely. Consider for instance the notion of the driver, or the chauffeur. Every time we see Marcello inside a vehicle, he's never driving himself, he's always being driven by someone else. In the same sense, he's also driven by others to do their dirty work for them. During the entire chase scene, Marcello occupies the backseat; when he's a little boy, he's chauffeured by Lino to a mansion; he and his fianc\u00e9e Giulia occupy a train cabin, etc. It's a neat and subtle way of symbolizing how Marcello is not in control of his own life and tends to follow those that lead. Half the story is basically told through the cinematography. Also important is the way in which Bertolucci links the themes of sex with fascism and violence and the desire to be 'normal' and how this is all intertwined in Marcello's mind. Marcello doesn't care about joining the fascists beyond that it will help him appear normal in the eyes of others. The themes of sex, violence and fascism are those that director Bob Fosse would utilize in Cabaret two years later. While both are successful in doing this in their own ways, there's a risk in that by equating the politics of their times with sex, you simultaneously ignore the other historical factors at play. Obviously, Bertolucci and Fosse are aware of this and that one film can't encompass the entire rise of Fascism, but it's important to note nonetheless. And it's peculiar indeed that these two films which so closely followed one another look at the subject of fascism through similar lenses. Either way, Il Conformista is classic cinema in the finest sense. The editing keeps the audience on its feet with the constant crosscutting between past and present, constantly promising death is on its way, the cinematography is lush and suggestive, Delerue's score is melancholy and tense, Trintignant is incredibly understated and Bertolucci's direction is wonderful. A political and psychological thriller for the ages.",

            "content": "The Conformist (1970)Well, the reputation this movie has for visual brilliance is well earned. There are whole scenes, lasting just seconds, that are breathtaking not only for the setting (or the sets) but for the way it's composed, a pair of figures in one place, a different scenario (and light) in the background. It's endlessly fascinating and evolving, this play of space and light and figures (actors, yes) moving through it all. It's also so stylized it becomes a force of its own, above the plot, which has its own kind of surreal fragmentation. So the end result is simply being there, somewhere, and having events twirl around you. This is almost enough. It's magical and moving and simply beautiful. The cinematographer was Vittorio Stararo, in one of his first films. He has worked with the director, Bernardo Bertolucci, on a whole bunch of films (\"Last Tango in Paris\" might be the most famous for American viewers), and also with other directors for some of their masterpieces: \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Reds\" are just two.This large, controlling, sometimes self-serving style might not suit everyone, but it does me. And in this case (\"The Conformist\") it's actually the strongest element. The rest of the movie is really a little bit of a mixed bag. That the end result is pretty fabulous is a testament to making some odd pieces fit, or not fit, perfectly.What doesn't become clear for some time is the point of the title, which is the moving, significant point of the movie: the main character survives Fascist Italy and then post-War, anti-Fascist Italy, but \"conforming,\" which is to say, he doesn't have particular beliefs, but he knows what will get him to survive. And for him, survival is all that matters, even if it means a watered down life. His professor of many years earlier is just the opposite, and is a kind of hero and de-facto enemy to him. This professor has left Italy in order to fight Mussolini, and he has to face death threats as a consequence. It's always interesting when the main character, this blow-with-the-wind Marcello, is not especially admirable or even interesting. He is surrounded by some quirky and inevitably interesting people, for sure, but even the two most important of these, his wife and his lover, are kind of symbolic and slightly unaffected types. I mean unaffected by all this terrible stuff going on in the lead up to the War. And so the end result is we are less affected than you would expect. Or like. Yes, I know this movie gets hugely appreciative reviews, and I think it's for the ambiance, and for the big anti-Fascist message (which is smart and powerful and I agree with). But as a drama between people trying to find themselves, to love the right people, to accomplish a violent political crime, it remains distant, at least most of the time.Another thing to note: even though the titles are in English, this was and is an Italian movie, with dialog in Italian and a little French. You'll find the sound is awkwardly dubbed--and I mean dubbed in the original language, a looseness of lip-synching that just wouldn't make it in Hollywood (and which you see in other earlier Italian films). Because in fact the dialog is often re-recorded later in movies like this (for superior sound, or because there was too much ambient interference), the synching becomes an issue. Ignore it if you can. It bugged me sometimes.Overall, yes, this is a kind of masterpiece--flawed, a little bit at arm's length, but stunning, too, and with an important theme.",

            "content": "Why did a seemingly ordinary man in fascist Italy, in the late 1930s,volunteer to become a political assassin? This movie reflects on some of the key factors involved and also shows the reasons why he found his mission far more difficult than he originally expected. The assassin's story involves sex, politics, treachery and murder but also focuses on the psychological impact of his experiences in a series of flashbacks that brilliantly illustrate the types of incidents that contributed to the inner turmoil that made him the repressed and deeply dissatisfied man that he'd gradually become.With the help of his blind friend Italo (Jose Quaglio), Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant) becomes a secret police agent and volunteers to assassinate the leader of an anti-fascist group. The man in question is Marcello's former university professor Luca Quadri (Enzo Tarascio) who, because of his political views and activism, had exiled himself in Paris.Marcello had always felt an outsider because of his privileged upbringing and visits he makes to his father (who's in an insane asylum) and his morphine-addicted mother (who's having an affair with her chauffeur), leave him feeling even more troubled. An incident that happened in his early teens when a chauffeur tried to molest him, left Marcello haunted both by his initial response to the situation and also the fact that he'd shot his assailant. His desperation over these issues intensified the need in him to conform to society's norms so that he could become more fully accepted by others and thereby feel more normal.In an attempt to achieve the type of normality he craved, Marcello had become engaged to Guilia (Stefania Sandrelli), an immature middle-class young woman whose preoccupations clearly irritated him. His impending marriage gave him the opportunity to arrange a honeymoon in Paris and this in turn provided him with the pretext he needed to go to the French capital. When he makes contact with Quadri and his much younger wife Anna (Dominique Sanda), he quickly becomes filled with doubts about what he's doing because he can't help but respect his old philosophy mentor and also becomes obsessed by the bi-sexual Anna who he finds infinitely more fascinating than his own wife.Marcello's dilemma deepens as he recognises that if he doesn't go through with the assassination he'll have lost his best opportunity to fit in with the majority of other people and it's only through the influence of a fellow agent called Manganiello (Gastone Moschin) that the mission goes ahead.\"The Conformist\" is a great movie in which the troubled intensity of its main protagonist is only equalled by its incredible visual impact. The beauty of its opulent, stylish interiors, its ornate furniture and the sheer scale of the marble interiors of the fascist headquarters make an indelible impression as does Vittorio Storaro's stunning cinematography. His inspired use of colour, some amazing visual compositions and tilted and overhead camera angles also add immeasurably to the experience of watching this film.There are a number of strong performances with Jean-Louis Trintignant predictably standing out. Ultimately, however, it's the story's subject matter that makes it so absorbing and the visual strength of the piece that makes it look so amazing.",

If you can get past the masterful photography (most don't) you'll find a chilly, inert, over-dramatic, hopelessly literal movie that defies any attempts to think about it. Every scene just underscores the obvious moral pronouncement about conformity that you got in the previous scene. There isn't a single pretty composition that delivers a point; it's the epitome of bowling over viewers with production design. If you want me to believe your movie has ideas, don't make it so superficial. If you're a viewer who craves ideas, you're going to starve watching this. It's absolutely facile despite continued accusations of depth. The visuals have stuck in my head for two decades, not so for the clumsy, unartful script, or any of its vapid content. Structurally, it's absolute mush; Trintiganant takes so long to execute his orders that any of his conspirators could (and do) eventually just do it themselves. The surface activity is prolonged just long enough to be called a film. This movie adds up to zip - It is nothing to me. I'm with Jonathan Rosenbaum who wrote: \"In retrospect, Bernardo Bertolucci's highly influential fifth feature (1969)--ravishing to the eye but less than fully satisfying to the mind--can be regarded as the lamentable turning point in an extremely promising career that ultimately chose stylishness over style and both over content.\"I would guide your attention instead to Amarcord which directors have been ripping off for thirty years.",

            "review_title": "plato's cave revisited.",
            "content": "I recently watched this film in my Italian cinema class and I believe it is one of the greatest films ever. Not only does Bertolucci mix elements of film noir and haunting surrealism, he is able to express his obsession with the illusion of reality. The film is based on the eponymous novel by Alberto Moravia, and although I have not had the pleasure to read it, I hear the film does not stray from the plot of the novel. Of course Bertolucci puts a spin on the chronology of the plot; allowing us to first see the film 2/3 into the plot, we weave back and forth between the protagonist's childhood, his admittance into the Fascist party and then finally the present.The film follows Clerici's quest for normalcy and acceptance, since he views himself as abnormal and an outcast from society. If it means he must marry the airhead giulia (his ticket to bourgeois life) he will. He tries to conform to society, and in doing so joins the Fascist party: the epitome of ideological conformity.The film is essentially about shadows in the cave, and the scene in which he meets up with his former professor is a direct allusion to Plato's myth. We see Clerici's shadow on the wall as professor Quadri recounts the myth. Clerici has been living his life, unable to exit this cave. He sees only shadows on caves, and instead of realizing they are merely shadows, lies, illusions, he remains imprisoned, like the prisoners in plato's cave. When the professor opens the window and light streams into the room, we believe this illumination will open Clerici's eyes. But he has failed to accept things that have happened in the past, and therefore is unable to grow up. He does not overcome his violent tendencies (he will take part in a conspiracy to kill Quadri since Quadri is an anti-Fascist in order to gain acceptance into the Fascist party) and lives forever boxed in that cave. The professor fails to illuminate Clerici because he is not the ideal Platonic hero: has abandoned Rome when the Fascist regime begins to rise and leaves his Italian followers to their own devices. He has not been a hero of the resistance, preventing others from joining the ranks of such a disillusioned ideology because as Clerici states: \"You left and I became a Fascist\".\nSome have questioned the scene between a 13 year old Clerici and the homosexual chauffeur named Lino. Some one said why does he have sex and then shoot him? First of all, Lino propositioned him, an act of sodomy never occurred. Second, at 13, Clerici (like most budding pre-pubescents) was probably intrigued and curious and then immediately ashamed by the so-called \"deviance\" of homosexuality. He shoots him because he becomes enraged in his attraction to Lino and seeks to punish he who almost set off his unknown erotic impulses. This crime will never leave him as he then sees he must atone for this sin by committing another: hence the murders of the Quadri and his wife (although she is not originally part of the conspiracy).\nItalo, his blind friend, is an ideologue, the embodiment of Facist theory. It is appropriate that he is blind, because those who followed the regime were blind and disillusioned. When they walk together down in the ranks of the coliseum, Clerici will once again place the blame on someone else for his crimes by accusing Italo of Fascist allegiance.",

Its a collaboration between viewer and filmmaker about sustaining a delivery channel. Its an intimate dialog, involving secrets, internal softnesses, selves, that you would rarely (usually never) expose to an actual human.The approach here and with Argento is that the nature of the camera carries weight. It isn't enough, say, that you are told that the particularly abstract fascism of Italy was aggressively designed out of attractive contrasts; you have to see it. You have to have that notion permeate the whole world you see. You have to collaborate, because the camera wouldn't be where it is unless you were watching, metafascistwise. The lights, the sun, the moon only take their places such because you have bent the world to conform. You, if you dare to watch this, are the conformist.Its a film about two women, one of only two and a half films of Bertaloucci that work for me. They sit in the film uneasily. Usually, we are given a real world and an idealistic, refined, theatrical and therefore unrealistic character. Think Holly Golightly. Here, its reversed. The world itself is what's bent. The two women are real, humans with desires and lives that color outside the lines and bleed untidily.One is more real, unsafe. Its remarkable that Bertolucci has avoided the trap of making her sexy along with being unsafe, real. There's sex, but its part of her, not the external stuff that makes the attraction. These were good days for this filmmaker and his cinematographer friend. You can clearly see the very collaboration between the two (the photographer in this case your avatar, the collaborator) reflected in the more grand films of Coppolla. It works there but is hidden by the noise of the stories. Here, it is more pure.We all die when the climactic event occurs. We've been rooting for this woman to prevail, perhaps in a sort of \"Casablanca\" ending, and our hero (and therefore ourselves) to be redeemed. Watch it and discover that we are not. Even today we conform, we choose the contrast, we die.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

            "content": "As many have noted, the technical aspects of this film --the cinematography in particular-- are quite striking and sometimes beautiful. Unfortunately, the work as a whole isn't as equally developed, especially the script; as a result the viewer is overly-conscious of Bertolucci's Important Message, to the detriment of the whole film. There are many scenes that are visually wonderful; for example, when the antihero Marcello, the Conformist of the title, visits his syphilitic father in a sanitarium. Bertolucci set the scene in the midst of fascist-era monumental architecture for a very surreal effect. However, Marcello's father isn't real at all--he's a mannequin propped up by Bertolucci to represent the Corrupt Old Political Order. The viewer isn't allowed to make his or her judgment about the character--apparently Bertolucci doesn't trust his audience enough-- so the demented father blurts out a confession about torturing people. Bertolucci has a POINT and in case you're too stupid to get it, he'll make it crystal clear. I found that annoying, and a constant problem in the film. Yes, the art direction in the scene is wonderful; but the dialog is so bad the viewer becomes conscious of Bertolucci's manipulations. It's off-putting.Bertolucci is equally ham-handed when he deals with one of the central metaphors of the film, Plato's analogy of the cave from the Republic. This, supposedly, was the subject matter of Marcello's thesis as a young philosophy student under his once-admired Professor Quadri, whom the older, Fascist Marcello has been assigned to assassinate. It's laughable to suggest that any philosophy student would write a thesis on the cave analogy and have it taken seriously by a professor; yet Professor Quadri spouts nonsense about Marcello's promise as a young student. The cave analogy is the biggest clich\u00e9 in Western philosophy. For film students, imagine proposing to your doctoral supervisor a thesis on the significance of Rosebud in Citizen Kane, and you get the idea. Bertolucci trots out this tired old nag to beat it to death once again with absolute seriousness. I couldn't help but roll my eyes. If Bertolucci had philosophical pretensions for this film, he should have enough sense to make it believable. This isn't. Bertolucci compounds his mistake by accenting the significance of the cave analogy with visual cues: the opening and closing of shudders. Overall, it signifies a sophomoric philosopher become too-clever film director.Bertolucci isn't satisfied with just philosophical ambitions for his story--it has to be Freudian, too. Early in the film, the audience sees in flashback a young Marcello, dressed as a dandified schoolboy, pursued by a harrying pack of boys. They trap Marcello and proceed to remove his knickers until they are interrupted by a passing chauffeur, whom we later learn to be Lino. Lino befriends Marcello, they play together in scenic parts of Florence, and then --sigh-- Lino invites Marcello into his apartment to see his gun, in both the literal and, I'm afraid, the metaphoric sense. In case you didn't miss it, this is a PHALLIC SYMBOL. Lino caresses Marcello until Marcello panics and begins firing the gun wildly, hitting Lino in the head and apparently killing him. This is Marcello's CHILDHOOD SEXUAL TRAUMA, which is clearly offered by Bertolucci as an explanation for his compulsive need as an adult to conform. Throughout the rest of the film, Bertolucci drops hints that Marcello is a closeted homosexual. He's sexually awkward with his attractive wife, but he compensates by engaging in casual sexual bragging with other men. He's attracted to Professor Quadri's wife, but the attraction is more fascination with her sexual liberation (she's bisexual) than with her. In several scenes there is noticeable sexual tension between Marcello and Manganiello, his Fascist spy partner, including an extended embrace. Manganiello isn't very bright, so he doesn't get it, but it's hard for the audience to miss. The payoff for all this Freudian subtext comes at the end of the film. Marcello meets his friend Italo in the streets of Rome while both of the them are trying to avoid capture by vigilante anti-Fascist mobs. The two of them pass by an older man and a younger man engaged in a conversation. Marcello overhears the older man obviously trying to seduce the receptive younger man with promises of food. Marcello suddenly recognizes the older man as --surprise!-- the chauffeur/pederast Lino, who didn't die after all. Marcello realizes that he isn't a murderer, and thus all of his attempts to conform to society were unnecessary. In a rage, he loudly denounces Lino as a Fascist, a homosexual and (naturally, according to the blunt psychology of Bertolucci) the murderer of Professor Quadri. Lino flees; Marcello turns his rage toward a panicky Italo, and denounces him as a Fascist, too. Italo is swept away in a celebrating crowd of anti-Fascists, leaving Marcello alone with the younger man.The final shot of the film pans over the naked backside of the younger man/male prostitute as he reaches from a bed to hand-crank a Victrola playing romantic music. Marcello sits against a nearby fence with his back to the younger man and the camera, then slowly turns head to gaze back at the male prostitute. Fade to black. This plot device is amateurish at best. Hitchcock handled Freudian themes (think Psycho) with a bit of irony and made them more believable and thus enjoyably creepy. In contrast, Bertolucci explores the Freudian theme of Marcello's repressed homosexuality with all the subtlety and seriousness of a first-year university student. As a character, Marcello is forced to conform to a psychological type, and that makes him less believable. Again, despite the visual dexterity of the film, I became very aware of Bertolucci's manipulation of the audience. Sexual repression is BAD and leads to Fascism. Oh, please.This is a film worth watching because of the beautiful images. Do yourself a favor: ignore the plot and Bertolucci's annoying intellectual pretentiousness. Turn off the subtitles and the dubbing, and you'll spare yourself some disappointment.",

            "content": "OK. The cinematography is amazing. We get it. But is this a great narrative? A great drama that somehow shows us something important about fascism? No way.At best this is a story about one chapter in the life of an eccentric mixed-up guy who worked for the fascists. And I don't think that's done in a satisfying way. The story leaves too many questions. Too many important scenes are left out. How come we never see what Marcello does during the week. It feels like he is a perpetual aimless bourgeois who wanders around Rome by himself. Does he have a job of any kind? Splitting the story up over six or so years didn't work for me either. Wouldn't it be important to see his wife's reaction immediately after the assassination? Too much is left out to form a complete picture of these characters. It's like the narrative focuses on some of the least interesting parts of the story. Why? And why does Anna (the professor's wife) kiss and otherwise get sexually involved with Marcello and his wife? Is this her way of trying to understand or reveal his true motives? I just don't buy it. Here she is with her and her husband's life at risk and she decides an appropriate strategy would be to flirt with the enemy behind her husband's back! This is a bizarre and maybe an interesting idea for a story in itself but in this context it just distracts us from the main themes. Also it makes her naive and unlikeable. Kind of like she's into turned on by self degradation or something.FInally the closing scene didn't work for me either. He denounces fascism? Well he starts shouting in a laneway at a time when the city is in upheaval. So what. He casts his eyes on the queer homeless guy at the end of the movie? Is this supposed to show he has latent homosexual desires? The scene is just too ambiguous to get any meaning from and the tone is wildly at odds with the rest of the movie. Have we suddenly moved into a zone of overt symbolism? It feels clumsy.I didn't discuss the sets or the colour or the cinematography here. It's great. Maybe some of the greatest in all cinema. But please don't say this is a well crafted story or some character study of fascism.",

            "content": "Bernardo Bertolucci's The Conformist (1970) is a film where the primary storyline is fatally flawed. 1) The protagonist, the civilian Clerici, is apparently the one who first approached the Fascist secret police with the plan to covertly infiltrate the group around the exiled dissident, Prof Quadri, so why did the secret police add a higher profile this simple plan by assigning a secret agent \"babysitter\", Manganiello, to the mission? A \"babysitter\", who was not very \"low profile\" at all in his clumsy and obvious attempts to tail Clerici around Paris. 2) Once the secret police decide, even before Clerici's arrival in Paris, that it is better just kill Quadri rather than to have Clerici infiltrate his group, then why use a volunteer civilian agent like Clerici at all, as opposed to a professional hit-man agent like Manganiello? 3) The actual scene where Prof Quadri and his wife are murdered is just a big unexplainable \"hole\" in this storyline altogether. a) Where did these other secret agents come from? Their presence in Paris comes out of nowhere in the storyline. b) How did these extra agents know about Prof Quadri's trip to his mountain resort? There is no evidence in the story of any prior contact with Clerici or Manganiello with this group. c) How did the car with the agent that blocked the road perfectly coincide on that long road with the location where the other agents were hiding in the woods? d) Why were so many agents needed to kill a college professor and his wife? e) Why did the agents inefficiently kill Qruadi by stabbing him multiple times with a knife when one gun shot would've done the trick? f) How could trained agents have allowed Quadri's wife to escape into the woods, thereby requiring an unnecessary chase after her? g) Why hide this band of agents in the woods at all, when they all could've been in the car that blocked the road? h) If this group of agents were the ones to kill Quadri and his wife, then why were Clerici and Manganiello even there, other than as bystanders? 4) The sudden change of plans to just assassinate Quadri, rather than to use Clerici as a mole to elicit information from him, and the subsequent assassination of Quadri without the involvement of Clerici whatsoever, makes the protagonist of this film virtually a nonentity, a superfluous character, to the main thrust of the storyline, namely, the Fascist secret police in Italy dealing with the exiled dissident Prof Quadri in Paris. This basic failure of the storyline makes the otherwise elaborate production of this film quite superfluous. This film has great cinematography, elaborate sets, intriguing symbolism, and effective innovative nonlinear editing all for NOTHING, in my opinion, because it was all just WASTED on a poorly thought out main storyline. All the fancy packaging doesn't compensate for a lousy gift, and that's what the viewer gets with this film. That this film received any awards at all, much less an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay, again confirms for me the irrelevance of film awards altogether. However much the poorly thought out storyline of this film conforms to the novel from which it is adapted is meaningless to me, because every film, whether a literary adaptation or not, must stand on its own merits and this film clearly does not.",

            "content": "I had watched this just once before and that was some 13 years ago on Italian TV \u0096 but I was surprised by how much of it I could still remember (considering its low-key and character-driven nature)! A much-requested title for DVD release, Paramount has come through with a satisfying \"Special Edition\".The film itself is difficult but required viewing: as with all of Bertolucci's work during this period, it's politically-motivated \u0096 with Jean-Louis Trintignant's ambiguous lead character virtually emerging as a symbol for our turbulent times; it remains the director's best film and, along with Jean-Luc Godard's CONTEMPT (1963), is also the most successful cinematic adaptation of an Alberto Moravia novel. Curiously enough, the address given for Professor Quadri's Parisian residence was actually the one where Godard himself lived at the time \u0096 so the film can be read as a metaphor for Bertolucci's own disenchantment with Godard's current film-making policy, having abandoned mainstream cinema for a more didactic approach! Bertolucci had also named Max Ophuls, Josef von Sternberg and Orson Welles as his idols and, indeed, the mise-en-scene of THE CONFORMIST is generally comparable to theirs in its operatic assurance: the detail and texture of Vittorio Storaro's cinematography and Ferdinando Scarfiotti's production design is at once exquisite and impeccable, while Franco Arcalli's inspired editing smoothly binds together episodes from the lead character's present life (as a Fascist agent assigned to eliminate his former teacher) and his equally secretive past (where he had killed a homosexual seducer) \u0096 and it's all beautifully underscored by the haunting music of Georges Delerue (who, incidentally, was also responsible for CONTEMPT).Most impressive among the cast were Trintignant, of course, but also Dominique Sanda (in perhaps her most significant role) and Gastone Moschin (who adds a welcome dash of humor to the generally heavy-going proceedings as the hero's baffled yet dogged partner). The film's highlights are certainly the tango sequence between Sanda and Stefania Sandrelli (which, obviously, anticipates Bertolucci's subsequent \u0096 and most \u0096 controversial film) and the Quadri assassinations set against the beautiful but unforgiving snowy landscapes. This \"Extended Version\" restores a rather irrelevant sequence (once thought lost) of a party given by a group of blind Fascists in honor of Trintignant's marriage.As for the DVD supplements: while an Audio Commentary with Bertolucci himself would have been a desirable commodity, Laurent Bouzereau's 3-part featurette (totaling some 38 minutes and comprised mainly of separate contributions from the writer/director and Vittorio Storaro) more than makes up for this loss and is actually quite thorough \u0096 analyzing all the various elements which have contributed towards making THE CONFORMIST one of the essential classics of World Cinema. For the record, I've still got a few Bertolucci films to catch up with \u0096 I own LA COMMARE SECCA (1962), LA LUNA (1979) and STEALING BEAUTY (1995) on DVD-R, DivX and VHS respectively \u0096 but just as many that I need to revisit \u0096 among them this film's predecessor/companion piece, THE SPIDER'S STRATAGEM (1970)",

This is one of the most shocking and upsetting sequences I've watched in a while, and it makes that slow burn all the more worthwhile.

He's the son of intellectuals, his father is in an insane asylum, while his bride is middle class bourgeois. The situation sums up his predicament, that he's a bit of a sensitive intellectual who is caught up in Mussolini's violent political culture with a pretty new bride who seems oblivious to it all. It appears he joins the Fascists to get ahead in society but his allegiance is put to the test after he's given the assignment to assassinate on of his ex- professors, a disaffected intellectual who moved to Paris to escape the fascists. Thus the honeymoon takes a turn to the ominous side. The story in Paris unfolds, leading to the event taking place on a snowy winter afternoon in a forest. His target and the target's wife suspected him all along but befriended him, with the ex-prof's wife even seducing him. Thus the title refers to those who lived under fascism without necessarily embracing it, merely going along with the current in order to try to succeed within a brutal system and not be arrested, with the system testing this individual's commitment to the cause. Mussolini is overthrown towards the end of the film, and the protagonist leaves his apartment to watch the regime's fall and try to switch over to the non-fascists who comb the streets looking for collaborators to execute. Bertolucci explores Italy's fascist past by portraying how it played out with a classic cowardly non- protagonist who fails to rise to the occasion.",

But that is not all: a reading of the immediately relevant sections of the Plato will make it obvious that it provided Bertolucci with a stream of imagery for the film. A reading of the entire work will reveal an even greater stream, largely taken from the discussions of tyranny and the tyrannic man (who, like the philosopher, is the same both dreaming and awake).

            "review_title": "normality of evil",
            "content": "Bernardo Bertolucci has a difficult posterity. Even the obituaries at his disappearance last year included more or less veiled criticism of his voyeurism in 'Last Tango in Paris' or 'The Dreamers' or its sliding into the extreme-oriental commercialism of 'The Last Emperor' and 'Little Buddha' . I believe that the grumblers should be sent to his early works, to '1900' and especially to this special film \"Il conformista\" (\"The Conformist\") in order to appreciate the emotional impact, the political commitment, and the cinematic aesthetics of a director who did not avoid scandals, but who deserved the glory that he enjoyed during his lifetime, which he still may recover in the history of Italian and world cinema.In 1963, a few years before \"Il conformista\" was made, Hanna Arendt published her book 'The Banality of Evil'. Inspired by the trial of Adolph Eichmann, Arendt theorized about the role of dull and mediocre personalities, ready to any compromise, which in the conditions of a totalitarian dictatorship can become the instruments of evil, accomplices and participants in the most odious crimes. It is very possible for Bertolucci to have known and read Hanna Arendt's book, because '\"Il conformista\" deals exactly with this subject, asking the question of the significance and even the possibility of 'normality' in an abnormal world, and having as main hero an Italian intellectual who lives under the trauma of a childhood sexual assault and aspires to become a normal and normative citizen of the world in which he lives - the period of Mussolini's fascist dictatorship. Based upon a novel by Alberto Moravia, the film describes a hero who is a victim of his own nightmares, of his desire to ascend socially combined with cowardliness and the betrayal of the ideals of his youth. In order to climb the social scale and to integrate into a world built in appearance for the pure and the powerful, he adapts his own personality through murder and complicity to the crimes committed by the fascist regime in suppressing the opposition. His treason works at all levels: intellectual, religious, emotional, familial. Marcello Clerici (played by Jean-Louis Trintignant already at the peak of a long career from which he never seems to have descended) will adapt his social path and try to establish a family that meets the social standards,. When he meets a woman who may give him a chance of rehabilitation, he is unable to accomplish with his own hands the murder mission he was trusted with, but also unable to save her. The end of the film suggests a betrayal of his betrayal. Adaptability changes color, and chameleonism will only change direction, depending on the requests of the new regime.This is the powerful political message of the movie and of the book that inspired him and it successfully passes the screen.Many of Bertolucci's films are exuberant visual performances, and \"Il conformista\"is no exception. We are absorbed in the world of 1938, but the image and the sets do not try to create a faithful reconstruction of the era, but rather a hyperbola of the hero's experiences. The city's scenery in Rome and Paris and the interiors of bourgeois suites or luxury hotels envelop spectators in the decadent atmosphere of a world on the edge of the abyss. Monumental decorations with crushing dimensions and the architectural style of the fascist Brutalism highlight the megalomania and the oppressive character of the dictatorship. The colors and the alternates of clear and foggy (as in the scene of automobile chase) are adapted to the carnal feelings or the indifference and the inability to act of the hero. The manner in which the action told and style of editing give a look of cinematic modernity. At no moment did I have the feeling that I see a movie made almost half a century ago. After all, cinematographic masterpieces are ageless.",

Bertolucci wrote the script which was later nominated for The Academy Award and made the perfect film, refined, complex, and visually amazing. The film portrays the corrupting deadly power of Fascism and does it much better than the same director's 5 hours long \"1900\" (1976) and \"Il Conformista\" does not even have a character like the monstrous Fascist, sadist-murderer Attila Mellanchini. \"Attilas\" of the world are obvious (it does not mean that they are less dangerous) but \"Marcello Clericis\" are not - all they want to do -is to fit in, to be accepted, to look and act normal, to conform, and there is no limit to how far they'd go on the road of lies and betrayal. Marcello Clerici (Jean Lois Trintignan) tries to suppress a childhood episode of sex abuse that had changed him forever and made him believe that he could become an assassin. To prove his loyalty to the fascist state, he accepts the order of the party superiors to assassinate his former college professor known for his liberal anti-fascist outlooks, which left Italy and resides in exile in Paris with the much younger wife (Dominique Sanda). Marcello is not a murderer but he belongs to the sort of humans on whom the famous publicist, Bruno Yasiensky gave the immortal description: \"Do not be afraid of your enemies. At most, they can kill you. Do not be afraid of your friends. At most, they can betray you. Be afraid of indifferent people! It is due to their silent indifference that the worst things happen in the world.\" \"Il Conformista\" is deservingly famous for its stunning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (who also shot for Bertolucci \"The Last Tango in Paris\" and \"The Last Emperor\"), production design by Nedo Azzini, Original Music by Georges Delerue, and Costume Design by Gitt Magrini. For me, \"Il Conformista\" is also the movie with one of the most beautiful and sexiest scenes ever filmed - Stefania Sandrelli (Marcello's naive young wife) and Dominique Sanda dancing tango.",

            "content": "What you will first notice here is the Wellesian ballet of the camera. It is stunning in itself but in this simple flamboyance I encounter Bertolucci's first limitation as a filmmaker; he's anxious to flaunt around visual beauty like there's too much of it and it needs to be disposed of in every frame, yet it's not abstracted from the story told, meditational, rather it's an adjunct to it ornamental in nature.By virtue of this, story and camera saying the same thing, the visual metaphors are never less than obvious, like the image of Trintignant behind bars that closes this.The film may then posit itself as difficult, but only because of the caprice of telling the story out of chronological order. Putting this together though doesn't unlock a reason why it was kept fragmented.Which brings us to what is seriously off here. Political films are seldom of any interest to me\u2014but this aims, by virtue of Plato and his cave parable, to illustrate something of the weave of the human soul.Plato was misguided in a lot of things as far as I'm concerned, most importantly that we can know the world by the mind (bogus even in its time) and that the idea of reality rather than reality as we know it is the first principle, but when he talks of shadows as distortions of the mind he nails it. What shadows here? Obvious images, and now here come the obvious ideas, which is a bigger failure. Plato's parable is used to illustrate the distorted reality experienced by the most obviously deluded individual, a fascist flunky. His world is made of chimeras of the mind, but a more astute filmmaker would show us that we're all inhabiting shadowy distortions of the world, believing we see when we don't really. In Coup de Torchon, it's a source of cosmic irony and amusement for the gods that a morally bankrupt character plays the moral arbiter who decides fates and law, the film then chills to the marrow with its humour because the amorality is left by the universe unmitigated and without reprise. The joke is that there are no hidden insights or moral lessons, only puzzlement at how controvertible our ideas of order and ethos can be.Unlike Tavernier's film, Bertolucci plays this out as opera, ostensibly a very serious study meant to enlighten and address wrongs. The sumptuous histrionics of this sweep but they don't probe. It's a silly film.",

            "content": "The \"conformist\" of the title is Marcello Clerici, a member of Mussolini's secret police during the 1930s. He is ordered to assassinate his former college professor, Luca Quadri, who is now living in exile in Paris because of his opposition to the Fascist regime. While in Paris, Clerici pays a visit to Quadri and, even though he himself has recently got married, flirts with the professor's beautiful young wife Anna. Scenes of Clerici's stay in Paris are intercut with flashbacks to his past, including his boyhood and his courtship of his wife Giulia.The reason why Clerici is referred to as a \"conformist\" is that he has an intense desire to conform to whatever are the prevailing social and political values. This desire is only partly motivated by careerism. It is also rooted in a psychological need for acceptance to demonstrate, both to the outside world and to himself, that he is \"normal\" and not an outsider or misfit. He is a cultivated, intelligent and educated man, and is not himself a convinced Fascist- indeed, he appears to have few, if any, political convictions- but has gone along with the regime because, in a one-party state, membership of the sole permitted party is essential to success in one's career and to social acceptance.Clerici's need to conform goes beyond politics. He does not love Giulia, but marries her because, in the socially conservative atmosphere of Fascist Italy, a traditional heterosexual marriage is seen as the social norm. Mussolini was an atheist, but for propaganda purposes liked to pose as the defender of Catholic orthodoxy, and had his own civil marriage converted to a religious one after becoming dictator. Clerici likewise lacks any religious beliefs, but is prepared to follow his leader's example and have a church wedding. He has no personal animosity against Quadri but is nevertheless prepared to kill him to demonstrate his supposed loyalty to the system. Indeed, one could say that Clerici's conformism functions as his secret weapon. Quadri instinctively, and correctly, senses his former pupil's lack of intellectual enthusiasm for the regime he serves. Unfortunately, this leads the professor to conclude, incorrectly, that he can trust him. Had Clerici been an obvious Fascist loyalist, Quadri might have been more on his guard.Bertolucci suggests that Clerici's conformism is rooted in his past. He was from a wealthy family but had an unhappy childhood; he was bullied at school and sexually molested by the family's chauffeur, Lino, whom he shot in revenge. His father has now become insane and his mother a drug addict. He seems to be driven by the psychological need to prove that, despite his troubled history, he is still \"normal\". The Lino episode is related during a scene in which Clerici makes his confession to a priest. This confession is a pure formality; it is a prerequisite to his church wedding. Clerici is not seeking forgiveness from God, in whom he does not believe, but there is an implication that he needs to seek forgiveness from himself.I have never read Alberto Moravia's novel on which the film is based, but a story like this could have served as the basis for a fascinating movie. Unfortunately, \"The Conformist\" is not that movie. Jean-Louis Trintignant is not particularly convincing as Clerici; he did not, apparently, speak Italian and his lines had to be dubbed. Using a French actor might have helped the film in the international market- this was officially an Italian/French/German co-production- but I felt it might have been better with an Italian in the role.The main problem is that too much is left unclear or unexplained. How deep, for example, are Clerici's feelings for Anna Quadri? Does she return his feelings? In a scene towards the end Clerici claims to recognise Lino, now an old man, whom he believes he killed. What is the truth? Did Lino, unknown to Clerici, survive that shooting? Or is Clerici mistaken in his belief that the old man is Lino? Throughout the film Bertolucci seems to be hinting that Clerici's desperate need for acceptance is rooted in repressed homosexuality, implying that at some deeper level he welcomed Lino's advances and shot him out of feelings of guilt, not repulsion. If Clerici were secretly gay, this would explain a number of things, such as his lack of any real affection for the attractive Giulia. This was, however, a theme which needed to be explored in a lot more detail to do it justice; possibly Italian censorship restrictions meant that it could not be.There are some good things about the film, such as the photography of cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, who is able to create a sense of space recalling the monumental architecture of the Fascist era; many buildings of the time are featured. Overall, however, I felt that Bertolucci was self-consciously trying to make a masterpiece but never quite bringing it off. 6/10",

            "content": "\"The Conformist\" is about a man desperately trying to conform and be \"normal\" in fascist Italy under Mussolini, although he is anything but fascist. When he plans to marry a \"normal\" fascist, ditsy Italian girl and takes a job to arrange an assassination of a previous teacher of his that is now a political dissident, his struggle becomes real. The professor's wife is a representation of him on the other side. He wants to conform, to fit in and be a fascist like everyone else, but can't force himself to do so, so he takes a fascist job in the secret police to suppress anti-fascism. But he begins to have second thoughts, and wants to get out, but can't find a way. The professor's wife on the other hand, is an anti-fascist, but she still feels fear that she may be killed by fascists, and the relationship between her and Marcello's wife, Giulia, is a metaphor for his internal struggle, as well as tensions and thoughts from both fascists and anti- fascists in Italy during the period of Mussolini. The scene at the dance is the penultimate moment of his decision in this, even at one part showing Giulia and the professor's wife, Anna, dancing around him as he frantically looks back and forth at them, as his fascist helper and the non fascist professor sit at opposite sides of the room. Then it seems he will pick the non fascist route when he dances with Anna, but as the next scene shows, it seems he had no choice in the first place. The dreamlike blue hue of the world turns into bleak whites and browns of the snow, as he watches Anna and the professor be murdered in front of him, by his own doing. And speaking of the cinematography, oh my God! This movie is absolutely beautiful and has some of the best use of lighting, color, and space that I have ever seen. Anyway, then it cuts to Marcello's years later, when Mussolini has just been taken down from the throne (by someone more powerful than him), with Giulia and kids, praying with them, showing he has fully conformed to \"normal\" life like he wanted to. But as he is reminded of the murders of the professor and his wife, he promptly states that that operation was \"good for his job\", with barely any emotion. He walks outside to see a man that he remembers from his childhood, shown earlier in the movie while he is confessing to a priest. In that scene, he is lead into a room by a young man that \"saved\" him from bullies, with the promise that he will show him a gun. He does show him a gun, and also begins to molest the child, but suddenly, Marcello stands up and shots wildly around the room before shooting the man, believing he is dead. Back to the present, he sees this man on the steps and immediately begins to call him a fascist and point the finger at him. This is representative of the way that Marcello suddenly begins to deflect the blame of his murders to Mussolini, now that it is normal for everyone to hate Mussolini, and to not hate him would mean to not fit in. However, I believe the final shot reveals that he is not the same person that he was back then, showing Marcello looking from behind bars looking through them at the boy that the man on the stairs was going to molest. This is also symbolic for the fact that he acknowledges he is not the victim anymore, but has become the perpetrator just to fit in, and now he needs to go back to the way he was before, but has already settled into his new, normal life that he has made for himself, showing that he will forever have to live with the guilt of what he has done.More rambling, but it's hard to form a coherent review of this film and get all of my thoughts on it out there after just one viewing. And that's another thing, this film most definitely warrants subsequent viewings.",

However, despite it being a pretty film, there is a strange coldness about the film and the characters--particularly the male lead. Now, to some extent this is GOOD, as he is a cold and repressed individual, but so often he just seemed to be walking through the film and going through the motions. It made you wonder WHY would the Italian Fascist secret police want HIM to work for them? I knew they were pretty inept in how they fought the war, but it really didn't make sense WHAT they saw in him. The same goes for his wife. She seems to love him desperately but he's such a cold fish. With just a little more humanity, he would have been more believable. That is because the horrible truth about so many of these cold blooded killers in Italy and Germany is that EXTERNALLY they seemed like good men--their \"normalness\" makes the evil they did so scary and inexplicable. Nice family men doing evil--that's more what I wished I had seen here.",

            "content": "Director Bernardo Bertolucci takes fascism's aggressive nationalism and mirrors it to Marcello Clerici's quest to be \"normal\". But Clerici doesn't just want to conform, he wants total assimilation. A wife, a child, a government job...Clerici cynically acquires such things and treats them like pieces of decor. Appliances which somehow complete him. What Clerici is doing is practising the anonymity of the Jew who desperately prays not to be identified when the trains roll in. Clerici wants to be invisible. He wants to be so like others that he renounces his atheism and attends Catholic confession so that his wife's parents may approve his marriage to their daughter. Bertolucci further highlights Clerici's need for conformity by bathing the film in a cool fascist aesthetic. This is a film filled with fascist architecture (especially that of the Gruppo 7 movement), furniture, 1930s modernism, Nazi chic, elegant clothes, sexy concrete facades and Leni Riefenstahl compositions.Midway in the film, Clerici, now a government agent, is ordered to travel to France and assassinate his old philosophy professor, a dissenter who speaks out against Clerici's homeland of Italy. Clerici does as told, of course, but while on assignment he begins to fall in love with the professor's wife, Anna.Anna's desirability has a lot to do with her free mind, her guiltlessness, her sexual liberation. She's a geyser of spontaneity which forces Clerici to confront the contempt he has for both himself and his own wife. Being with Anna provokes a sense of introspection for Clerici, as he realises that his fascism stems from a need to overcompensate for various personal dysfunctions, neuroses, perversions and insecurities: he almost murdered someone as a child, felt isolated as a kid due to his family's wealth, suffered beatings and humiliations at school, his mother is a drug addict, his father is mad, he had homosexual experiences and the only time he openly wants to have sex is when his wife tells him of a six year affair she had with an old man.The film thus links Clerici's repression and his various dysfunctions - be they of a religious, class or sexual nature \u2013 with the very ideology of fascism. Homosexuality, class divisions, murder, insanity, disobedience, sex with old men, drugs, violence, wealth, atheism...these aren't just arbitrary things inserted into the film, these are symbolic of the very anxieties of fascism. Like Clerici, fascism's hatred for feeling and public love, its machine like repression, stems from its incapability of understanding its own desires. Like patriarchy and religion, fascism attempts to create neuroses which allows it to reign over people, in much the same way that \"family values\" are decisive to conservatism.So what the film seems to want to do is articulate the thoughts of Wilhelm's Reich's 1933 book, \"The Mass Psychology of Fascism\", which in the late 60s was the bedrock of most studies into the \"workings\" of fascism. Reich believed that fascism is nurtured through the anchoring of sexual inhibition in the authoritarian miniature state of the family. That fascist anxiety stems from this suppression, which ultimately results in a form of paralysis in which the subject is adjusted to the authoritarian order and willingly submits to it in spite of his degradation. Anna, recognising Clerici's fascist sympathies, thus deliberately makes sexual advances toward him and his wife. She believes he can change, that she can \"nurse\" him out of his anxieties, but such possibilities have long faded. Whilst Bertolucci portrays Italy as a landscape of fascist architecture, France is all romance, liberalism, crowds, groups and dances. We think Clerici has \"merged\" with a new group, a better group which will somehow set him free, but instead such a confrontation further increases his alienation. From here on, he's increasingly photographed in corners, hunched over, quietly brooding. In one scene he is literally engulfed by a spiral of dancers. Refusing to dance with them, and yet surrounded by their bodies, it is here that he feels most alone. In an attempt to combat having to reveal himself to others, Clerici clings further to normalcy. But it is the stoic normalcy of a foreign country, of an Italy that is itself on the verge of change. This change occurs during the film's ending, which takes place in 1943 during the fall of Mussolini and his fascist dictatorship. Clerici now has a small child and seems to live the \"conventional\" lifestyle he so craved. But walking out on the streets one night he meets Lino, a man who attempted to molest him as a boy. When a crowd of anti-fascist protesters approach, Clerici suddenly publicly denounces Lino as a homosexual, Fascist, and for participating in the murder of the Professor and his wife. With fascism on the way out, Clerici's \"conventional life\" now becomes just another anxiety, a thing of shame which he tries to push upon the crowd which sweeps past. What he fails to realise is that conformity is itself an absurd idea. The very quest for normality can itself be murderous, as it cares for nothing but its own pursuit of a blessing or a pardon that should not have to be asked.Incidentally, Bertolucci was a huge admirer of Godard. In one scene of \"The Conformist\", Bertolucci has one character mention Godard's home address and telephone number. \"The number was Jean-Luc's and the address was his on Rue Saint Jacques,\" Bertolucci would admit in interviews. \"So you can see that I was the conformist wanting to kill the radical.\" Godard hated the film, and increasingly, Bertolucci.8/10 \u2013 The film's attempts to get into the \"psychology of fascism\" are a bit superficial now. Nevertheless, one can still appreciate Vittorio Storaro cinematography, chiaroscuro lighting and Scarfiotti's production design. See \"Hotel Terminus\" and \"The Hour-Glass Sanatorium\".",

            "content": "I heard much about this film, and was looking forward to finally watching it on DVD. First, to give it all justice it deserves, the cinematography is brilliant - the film is full of mesmerising shots, and even though I often feel uneasy when I am made too conscious of cinematography, in this film it worked perfectly, and added much to the story. I also found the acting to be of a very high standard - especially the two female leads, and Jean-Louis Trintignant.However, like some other reviewers, I was not impressed by the writing and the way the narrative was presented. It felt very disconnected, and sometimes confusing, with rough jumps between scenes, often making characterisation deficient. Perhaps it was a conscious decision aimed to convey Marcello's neurotic state and his need to belong, yet I felt that the camera-work alone did the job pretty well, especially the lighting (e.g. in the scene when we first see Guilia, in a striped dress, with moving light source patterned by the blinds, it reflects Marcello's mixed feelings about her), and the unorthodox angles. Also, I still wander if the narrative is objective, or maybe some of the scenes are Marcello's wishful thinking - while watching, I had a theory that the blue light indicated these, but it didn't quite hold up till the end.And, next to the ambiguous episodes, there are some annoyingly blatant parts. The metaphor of blind fascists was just too in-your-face; Marcello's constant speeches about his desire to be normal sounded fake, and generally his character development as defined by the script wasn't handled well; the shadows on the wall during the Plato talk - once again, too predictable (still beautiful, though!); and finally, the murder of Prof. Quadri alluded to Caesar's in such an obvious way that I honestly thought he'd say 'You too, Marcello!'. In itself, it is not a bad thing, but I think it ruined the flow and the tension of the scene, creating a very abstracted picture of treason and cowardice - a much simpler idea could have been more effective. However, I have to say that this scene was then redeemed by Dominique Sanda screaming in front of the car window, and the following chase shot with a hand-held camera.The bit I liked about the plot was the suppressed homosexuality theme, under-stressed but sustained throughout the film with several moments of restrained homoeroticism, and the ending. I also liked the general air of the 30s, and the music - the credits song is currently stuck in my head.Overall, while definitely a landmark of cinematography, The Conformist suffers from the need of a better script - 6/10.",

Attempting to regain a normal life by trying to fit into the Italian Fascist State, he is required to betray and kill his favorite \"liberal\" college professor.  This is what compels us to keep watching--can Clerici go through with this ultimate betrayal?  If he does, what are the consequences?The best parts of the film, though, are the uniquely chosen and symbolic shots.  One that stands out in my mind is a scene where Marcello is caught in the middle of a swirling dance by his wife, his professors wife, and the patrons of a nightclub/restaurant.  This symbolizes his inability to fit in with any aspects of his life.  Bertolucci continues his knack for symbolism throughout the film without spoiling the flow of the story.

            "content": "The Conformist belongs to the period when Bernardo Bertolucci almost seemed to derive from cinema itself, his films made up of one indelible scene after another, and yet feeling entirely unified, their structures and textures intuitively complex. A typical synopis of the film, as prompted by the title, emphasizes the protagonist Clerici's project of attaining his concept of normality, embodied here by his marriage to a mundane woman and by his willing participation in the activities of the ascendant Fascist party, but while that's not exactly inaccurate, it's hardly true to the visceral experience of watching the film. On the contrary, the film teems with moments in which Jean-Louis Trintignant's Clerici asserts and differentiates himself, whether physically (such as his exaggerated posing with a gun he's just been handled) or behaviourally (his immediate aggressive attraction to the character played by Dominique Sanda): the memory that overshadows his life, of having killed a predatory chauffeur as a young boy, appears as much a source of perverse transgressive pride as a source of guilt. This perhaps well-equips him to participate in the performative aspects of Fascism, but not to be as effectively a cold-blooded executor of orders; near the end we see him damned as a coward, as repulsive to the Fascist order as their more usual victims. Bertolucci observes this progress through a dazzling series of compositions and incidents, both sweeping and intimate, creating a sense of a heightened, fragmented state that mysteriously channels that of Clerici. In the end, the fall of Fascism and rise of a new social order coincides with his discovery that his origin story was wrong all along, and he loses his bearings, becoming stridently accusatory before sinking into a final ambiguous silence. The grotesque theatre that enabled him, it seems, has come to a close; it's just one of the film's satiating ironies that the new world, however more worthy and just, may lack the dangerous, amoral panache of the old one.",

When fortitude begins to fail him, Marcello begins to question his reasoning, though he doesn't back down.Marcello's world finally collapses around him at the same time that Communism dies in Italy. Tragically, good people pay with their lives before he realises his awful error.Jean-Louis Trintignant is excellent as the obsessive Marcello, and support is strong from Stafania Sandrella, Gastone Moschin, Enzo Taroscia, Pierre Clementi, Dominique Sandra, Christian Alegny and Jose Qaglio.

Desperate to feel \"normal\", he joins the Italian fascists, and soon finds himself in a situation where he's been assigned to assassinate a former mentor/father figure, an anti-fascist figure living in exile in France. A beautifully photographed, well-thought out film: notice all the shots that show the protagonist as an atomized individual, for instance, lost in the marble acres of government buildings. Bertolucci undercuts his protagonist's quest remarkably: despite all of his efforts to fit in, to conform, he'll always be a lonesome figure, a man apart. (Note that at the climax, the protagonist neither joins the killers nor tries to stop them \u0096 in his ultimate moment he cannot conform.) All that said, this is a movie that sounds more interesting than it really is. It's remarkably static, even for art-house fare \u0096 once you \"get\" the idea it never really develops. All we see are variations on the theme. None of the characters are likable and so it's hard to summon up much energy to care about their fate. If the protagonist is meant to be considered, at least in part, a \"type\", an example of how fascism develops, then I would argue it's a pretty shallow understanding.I do think this is a legitimate work of art: there's too much going on here, too many depths to uncover. It's a movie that probably would repay repeat viewings, which is as good a definition of \"art\" in movies as I think there is.

Vittorio Storaro worked wonders with the director to effectively filter light through shutter, curtains, trees, car windows and more. It is undoubtedly a stunning looking film. It remains, however, a car journey with flashbacks, some recent, some of childhood and dreams too, all colouring in a small episode that we all know will be repeated all over Italy and the rest of Europe in the years following.

Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is part of a Fascist espionage organization. After his wedding with Guila (Stefania Sandrelli) he goes to Paris, France for his honeymoon and for a deadly mission. Marcello must face his dark past and deal with the consequences for join this Fascist organization. The main character, Marcello Clerici, is very complex. First we can see that he is confused man not knowing what he really wants with his life. His only concern is to know if he is a \"normal\" person and that's why he joins the Fascist organization. But when Marcello's dark past comes to light, we can understand a little more the reasons of his acts. As a child, Marcello has an event that makes him be close to the violence and the sexuality, an event that change his life. The fact that Marcello always believes that he kill a man is the reason of a childhood trauma that end in a confused man. Later the film turns into some kind of erotic story with Marcello feeling something for another woman. You know how this \"erotic\" story is supposed to end but Marcello makes you think that maybe that story can be different because he hasn't any real thoughts. And that's confirmed in the last sequence of the film set after the resignation of Benito Mussolini. In that sequence Marcello recognizes a man of his dark past and accuses him for what he did in Paris. In a way we can say that Marcello's accusation was understandable because that man change his life but later Marcello accuses the man for be a Fascist and also accuse his own partner of the Fascist organization. Marcello was a confused man without any real ideals, just being a conformist according to the times.The cast is superb, with a very powerful performance of Jean-Louis Tringtignant. The beautiful ladies Stefania Sandrelli and Dominique Sanda are great too as Giulia and Anna Quadri, respectively. Also with the performance of Gastone Moschin who is more known for his terrific role in \"The Godfather: Par II\" as Don Fanucci, in the part with Robert De Niro as young Vito Corleone.Conclusion: \"Il Conformista\" is a great but complex film that needs more than one view. It has a great story that is pure Bertolucci and the cinematography by Vittorio Storao, who is just the maestro, is just magnificent with many beautiful and memorable scenes. This film is definitely worth watching and a must-see for any Cinema lover . 9.5 out of 10DVD: I recently get this DVD and it's really good. Is a single-disc edition but it does have extras including three features to know more about the film.

            "content": "Watching this film reminds me of the futility and arrogance that exists in attempting to sum up in words a film that possesses such breadth and splendor.  A film that took countless talented professionals, and more hours than the average viewer is capable of imagining to create.  Never has the thought of the aforementioned futility seemed as relevant as it does with The Conformist.  With that in mind I will attempt to toil in such futility for if we viewed everything from that point productivity would be an impossibility.  The Conformist is an ambiguous film without being fatuous or impalpable.  Bertolucci and his collaborators are daring, because they either respect the audience enough to present them with one of the most admirable characteristics a film can possess - a challenge, or they just don't care.  Whatever the case may be it is extremely evident that they are going to make the film the way they know it should be made.  The film succeeds because it is fearless.  The makers of this film were not afraid to take risks they welcomed them.  The photography by Storaro is breathtaking analogous only to works of other geniuses at the top of their game.  The precision of the compositions in certain scenes is extraordinary and the lighting is some of the best that any film throughout history has to offer. The score by Delerue is also remarkable.  The storyline is intriguing, but I find that aspect is typically best if left to the viewer since it is predominantly experiential.  While this is not intended as a criticism this film is extremely dark, perhaps the darkest I've ever seen.  I remember being shocked the first time I heard someone claim that Vertigo was a terribly dark film, and even in recent viewings it has not struck me as such, but the Conformist certainly is.  Nearly all of the characters seem to be lost causes and with the exception of a couple none of them really stand for anything.  If you have not seen The Conformist you must go out and rent it immediately, I promise you won't be disappointed.  The only drawback of this film is that it is so superior to most that upon viewing the film it makes it that much harder to give other films a fair chance.  Of course those other films are created in a system where the artistic aspects of film are threatened by Hollywood's insatiable appetite for commercial success, and never once do they realize that few great films go unnoticed.  In that regard even though it is just as slick technically as any Hollywood film ever made it is actually the antithesis of a Hollywood film.  Essentially The Conformist is such a prime cut that it makes an average film look like a flimsy processed patty from Burger King.",

Although it's set in a historical milleau, it's striking cinematography emphasises fascist architecture in such a way that makes it feel more as if it was set in the sort of dystopian future Mussolini wanted to create, instead of the world he actually presided over. At it's centre is a man without a moral centre, torn between assassinating his former professor (for the cause) or abandoning his mission to elope with the professor's wife: the two dance their way an erotic but weary and resigned flirtation before the decision is made. The sense of detachment is intriguing but ultimately hollow. In a strange way, the movie almost seems to endorse the choice of its protagonist, in a world already stripped of its humanity.

The story of a man who was raped when a boy by his chauffeur and struggles for the rest of his life to affirm his sense of 'normality' through the embrace of political orthodoxy even to the extent of becoming an assassin for Mussolini's regime, the film has been interpreted by some critics as a political allegory, but I think it is best understood as primarily a psychological study. The narrative structure is sometimes confusing, but the flashbacks help to highlight the fracturing effect which this traumatic event has had on our 'hero's psyche, and his inability to escape the past. In that sense it serves a legitimate cinematic purpose and is not deliberately obscurantist in the manner of late Bunuel or Goddard.The film is also about friendship and betrayal, and achieves great poignancy the night before the assassination is due to take place, with all the major characters eating, dancing and laughing together. It also achieves a haunting evocation of 1930's Europe, presaging the horrible and traumatic events that are to come. An extraordinary piece of cinema.",

For example, the protagonist figures his half-brother is giving their mother morphine and having sex with her, so he has a fellow fascist slap him around.

The Conformist takes place in 1938 as a repressed young man, Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant), tries to conform to the prevailing mood of Fascism, but gets out of his depth when he turns informer.Bertolucci makes use of the 1930s art and decor associated with the Fascist mentality and era: the middle-class drawing rooms and the huge halls of the ruling elite. It's a psychologically astute and brilliantly realized recreation of an age; it's no accident that the Fascist-era architecture looks so imposing and tempting.

It combines many his recurring themes; politics (especially fascism in Italy and it's effects), sexuality and identity, the need to belong, the struggle to be an individual. The film perfectly walks a knife's edge between realism and surrealism, supported by Vitorio Storraro's breathtaking and unique cinematography. The film works brilliantly on a simple realist level. A sort of political thriller and character study (much like Coppola's 'The Conversation') we follow an agent of Mussolini's secret police (a great performance by Jean-Louis Trintignant, even dubbed into Italian) as he's sent to assassinate one of his old professors, now teaching in exile in Paris. On that level the film is filled with odd twists and turns as Marcello tries to carry out his mission. But there's also something larger and more mysterious being explored here, from the constant not-quite-realistic images, to Marcello's occasionally very odd (and sometimes funny) behavior, to the flashbacks to an early homosexual encounter, we are trapped, with the character, in a sort of Kafkaesque dream world. It's as if somehow Bertolluci has pulled off the very neat trick of making a film that' simultaneously objective and subjective, a dream and a reality, surreal and hyper-real. And he makes the two dance together to create a bigger whole. My only tiny quibble;, a few moments seem a little too on the nose in their symbolism for a film of such subtlety, but that's a tiny complaint about a great film.",

Under a fascist government, in which the State is above everything and the individual is secondary, this is particularly true. What we see in Bertolucci's \"The Conformist\" is a man's attempt to become just another one, the \"ordinary man\"; Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Tritignant), haunted by a experience in childhood, marries a bourgeois woman, beautiful but shallow, and joins the fascist party, becoming in the surface the typical Italian. However, he receives a mission from the party: go tho Paris and kill a former professor, a anti-fascist. But the main conflict is not the external, if Clerici is going to kill the professor or not, but his inner one to control his impulses and act in the way he is supposed to. Notice that, despite his seriousness, he is often making faces and even jumping around, when nobody is watching (for instance, when entering the house after telling Manganiello to beat the driver). Trintignant, which is an actor that often seems to be hiding something below the calm surface ( which was used very effectively also in Three Colors: Red), and who was in the peak of his career, after winning the Golden Palm for \"Z\" and star also in Eric Rohmer's \"My Night At Maud's\", is the ideal actor for the role, and delivers a truly magnificent performance. Few actress had such a screen-presence as Dominique Sanda, and perhaps none so inexperienced. The supporting cast works very well too. Bertolucci's directing, like Visconti's, is very elegant, but is not afraid of showing sex and violence, although never or doing it just for the shock- which he continues to do even today, in movies like the underrated \"The Dreamers\". Costumes and art direction are very rich. But any review of this film can not be complete without talking about Storaro's cinematography, one of the greatest of all time, and which can only be completely appreciated on the big screen, like i watched this time (i had already seen it before in terrible conditions); his use of the color and composition and the way it enhances the mood of the movie and of the characters is unique, and creates a lyrical atmosphere that has never been surpassed.

Yes, it is certainly a visually stunning film -one of the most beautiful films I have seen in some time in fact. However there seems little else to recommend it. The main character is a \"conformist\". How do we know this? Well, because he literally TELLS US in the first couple of minutes. He certainly does not act like it ...and this is pretty much what you can expect for all of the themes explored in the film -every unconvincing and unsubtle point will be rammed home ham-handedly. Certainly there is no convincing portrayal of the anxiety which drives the desire to conform, and the relationship between this anxiety and fascism -something which would have been a very worthy subject matter. On the contrary the protagonists behavior is on the contrary quite odd rather than conformist. A real missed opportunity here. Characterization, in so far as it exists, is crude and didactic (this goes for all characters, not just the protagonist). There are a number of weird themes, visual sequences and actions by characters throughout, which I can only assume is a crude attempt to qualify the film as \"arty\", as well as some utterly comical pseudo-intellectualism (bringing to mind something like \"first year philosophy students at lunch in the quad\"). I could go on in some detail, but hey, in the present case what's the point??? The film concludes with a rather nasty apologist message, the apparent \"moral\" of the film, equating fascism and anti-fascism as two sides of the same coin. This message is hammered home repeatedly and crudely in the final minutes so as to make sure we don't miss the point. Firstly, I got it the first time -the final scene (where the protagonist denounces two guys as fascists) was both unnecessary and awkwardly unsubtle. Secondly, I just don't buy it -fascism and anti-fascism are just not the same thing. All in all \"Il Conformista\" left a very bad taste in my mouth.I'm not a liberal-arts type guy, and I know very little about Italian history, so maybe it's me that's just to dumb to \"get it\"? I don't think so, but I figure even if this was the case that would clearly make the film unsuccessful as a piece of communication.

This need to belong is in some way connected to a traumatic childhood event.Jean-Louis Trintignant exceptionally plays Clerici, an assassin of Mussolini, who is conflicted between love and friendship on one end, and his duty on the other. It's really one great, complex role, that I gather few could even of come close to performing as well. Two female characters also give great performances: Stefania Sandrelli who plays his fianc\u00e9, and Dominique Sanda who plays the wife of a Professor Clerici is hired to assassinate. The screenplay is superb, and no scene is uninteresting, though a lot of people will have to see it twice to truly understand it. It's a classic psychological story in the same league of Crime and Punishment. Fascism is a backdrop, it's not the main theme. The main theme is how a traumatic event early in life can cause one to wallow into darkness many years later, to the extent where the need to belong, even to something they don't like or believe in, is more important than anything else.",

            "content": "The Conformist is primarily a stylistic exercise, but one where the stylisation is a part of the character's psychology. As such, it's one of the great works of cinema that is actually \"cinematic.\"Since the entire film is a flashback within a flashback (the end of the film is in fact the beginning) it takes the form of an extended sequence of personal recollections in the life of a character haunted by terrible betrayals; unable (through arrogance or simple- mindedness) to understand how he could so egregiously sell-out his closest friends.As such, the film is not a linear retelling of actual events, but an abstraction of these events. Colour, lighting, camera placement and transitions between scenes are each intended to remove the film from reality and evoke the character's state of mind; his fear, passion, duplicity and cowardice reflected in the filmmaking form. The character here is intended to symbolise the progression of the country itself; here the question of complicity during WWII becomes far more relevant to the corruption of Italy's dark war-time past. As such, the film is as an accusation against this character and in turn an accusation against Italy during the pre and post-war years. For all this talk of politics, the character is not political. He is - as the title suggests - a \"conformist.\" He presents whatever personality or conviction he thinks people want him to possess. As such, the filmmakers create a character preoccupied only with the surface of things; he's essentially shallow; a dress-up Marxist turned dress-up Fascist with no genuine beliefs or ideologies of his own. Again, this characterisation and the use of stylisation are a way to show the world as the character sees it (or more accurately how he wishes he could see himself); it is not the reality, but becomes more of an extended psychodrama of how the reality has been transformed by years of regret. Further, this lack of actual \"character\" is presented in other aspects of the film. The protagonist is a heterosexual, who after being molested as a child convinces himself that he's a homosexual, and then as a reaction to this tries to pass himself off as a heterosexual (again) in order to conform. This is something only revealed to the character at the end of the film when he finally discovers that the molester he thought he had killed as a child is really alive; his guilt and shame were his own invention. Finally the film is profoundly personal to Bertolucci. The relationship between the \"conformist\" and the professor is based on the relationship between the filmmaker and his great hero (and biggest cinematic influence) Jean-Luc Godard. Bertolucci, who desperately wanted to be Godard and couldn't, betrays his mentor and has him brutally murdered. This is further reflected in the style of the film, which builds on elements of Godard's own style (especially in the films Le Mepris and Pierrot le fou) with the influences of German expressionism, pre-war French cinema and the American film noir. With The Conformist Bertolucci is drawing a line under his \"Godardian\" political films of the 1960s and embracing a more formalist cinema that deals with the psychology of characters and their own perception of the world as they create it.",

Good performances and stylish cinematography.Jean-Louis Trintignant gives an absorbing performance as the man who keeps up neutral appearances whilst stabbing supposed friends in the back in the name of personal and political expediency. As David Thomson says: 'His personality in The Conformist is the weakness of the obsessive fantasist, his face closed to guard his own private image of the world.' Italian society's corruption is mirrored in this individual, with Stefani Sandrelli's stylish Giulia an accomplice in her willing blindness to politics and the darker details of her husband's life. Giulia is all stylish surfaces - abstract dresses and flapper instincts - and is one with the lingering moral vacuity prevalent in the wider society.There are subtly memorable moments and sequences, which persist in the memory like strains of opera; Bertolucci directs in a stately, but underplayed fashion - capturing a fine sense of colour and mise-en-scene within the frame. Slightly reminiscent of Antonioni, in this sense.Overall, an absorbing portrait of a man who, in Tom Milne's terms is 'so anxious to live a normal life that he willingly becomes an anonymous tool of the state.'

            "content": "Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is a fascist when the fascists are in power but becomes an antifascist when the fascists lose power. Hence he is the conformist of the title of this extraordinary movie adapted by Italian film legend Bernardo Bertolucci from Alberto Moravia's novel. But more significant than his political conformity is his ability to bend his sexual nature to what is acceptable. The defining event of his childhood is his incomplete seduction by a gay chauffeur. When conformity to the fascist rule in Italy under dictator Benito Mussolini becomes the norm, Marcello marries the ordinary (but very pretty) Giulia (Stefania Sandrelli) whom he describes as \"all bed and kitchen.\" Marcello thereby sentences himself to a boring but secure petite bourgeois existence. He will simply suppress his \"abnormal\" instincts.In a sense this is a character study using a familiar theme, that of sexual repression leading to repressive political expression, such as psychoanalytic theory assigned to the fascist mentality. But Marcello is less interested in sadistic expression as he is with as a secure existence. He is something of a shrewd coward, cold, calculating, and indifferent to the feelings of others. We see this strikingly in the scene in the woods when Anna Quadri (Dominique Sanda), who is being chased by fascist thugs, pounds desperately on his car window. But he is completely unmoved and just stares at her with consummate indifference.But what really enhances this film is the beautiful cinematography by Vittorio Storaro and the extraordinarily designed sets and scenes envisioned by Bertolucci. I am reminded of Michelangelo Antonioni's gorgeous Blow Up (1966) and Swedish director Bo Widerberg's stunningly beautiful Elvira Madigan (1967) from the same era. I think Bertolucci wanted to make a film that was politically and psychologically significant but also one that was strikingly beautiful. He used not only sumptuous settings but hired two beautiful actresses in Sanda and Sandrelli. And because this movie is about sex (as it almost certainly must be, having been adapted from a novel by Moravia who was a master at expressing human sexuality) Bertolucci made the movie sexy and sensual. Sanda, whom I previously saw in Vittoria De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis which came out a year after El Comformista (1970) where she played the beautiful, enigmatic, but icy Micol Finzi-Contini, here plays Anna the bi-sexual wife of one of Marcello's college professors--the man whom Marcello has been instructed to help kill. Sanda is exquisitely sensual as she works to seduce Giulia while at the same time both teasing and rejecting Marcello's advances.Sandrelli is not be outdone. She too is beautiful and sensual even if the character she plays is a bit ordinary. The scene on the train where she describes to Marcello how she was ravished as a teen by an older man (the family lawyer) is very moving sexually, and very revealing because Marcello takes her description as a guide in how to make love to his wife! We can see clearly that he needs some instruction since he apparently is not really moved by her beauty.While the film itself stands alone as an artistic achievement, I want to compare it to the novel from which it was adapted. The main difference is that in the novel we learn so much more about the character of Marcello because of Alberto Moravia's use of an interior monologue throughout. Rather than merely a conformist, in the novel we see that Marcello's character is that of someone who seeks the trappings of conformity and normality because he rightly fears he is not the entirely normal person he would like to be. Ironically it is Giulia who nearly always conforms to what is considered normal behavior and who harbors uncritically the knee jerk beliefs and opinions that she has learned from church and state. Marcello is attracted to her not so much because she is pretty but because she is authentically ordinary and therefore by association he too is not abnormal. It is abnormality that Marcello fears.The ending in the novel is also different than in the movie although the sense of who Marcello is does not change. In the novel Quadri is a hunchback and his wife is clearly a lesbian who has married him for convenience and security, whereas in this film she is bisexual and he is more like someone she might marry for love. Another difference is in how what happens to the Quadris and the extent to which Marcello is responsible. Bertolucci chose to have Marcello at the scene, whereas in the novel he has no direct experience of their fate. Of course the novel, which is over a hundred thousand words long, goes more deeply into the character of Marcello than is possible in a film. The true psychological complexity of his character comes through, especially his struggle with sexual ambiguity. We see more clearly why he embraced fascism.But the film is true to the novel in most respects and certainly in the main sense that Moravia intended, that of showing how a particular type of fascist mentality arises and is maintained. But Marcello, although an authentic fascist is not necessary a typical one. The idea that fascists in general follow the herd and adopt a superficial and uncultured world view is no doubt largely correct, but the essence of fascism is the belief in authoritarian rule, the stratification of society, intolerance of diversity, and a willingness, even an eagerness to use force and violence to obtain such ends. The psychology underlying the portrait by Moravia and Bertolucci is the idea that Marcello sees in himself violent and selfish tendencies and so it is only natural that he should adopt a political philosophy that condones and acts out such tendencies.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "Bolstered by fetching filming locations and swell use of lighting, director Bernardo Bertolucci demonstrates a masterful, artistic sense of arresting shot composition and dynamic camerawork. Factor in exquisite costume design, hair and makeup work, and production design broadly, and I can't think of many other pictures that immediately inspire for how visually rich they are. In the most twisted of ways this appealing veneer dovetails neatly into the far more unsavory flavors of the content, a relationship that in reality is one of significant contrast. For this is a feature that explores, generally with rueful good cheer, the terrible ease with which a person may slide into corroboration with the worst people in the world; how better to leave a peaceful life free of external tribulation than to surrender all will to the most oppressive halls of power? Carrying themes and ideas that are as sadly, infuriatingly relevant in 2022 as they were in the 1930s when this is set, 'The conformist' is aptly named, and at once both pleasing and difficult to watch.The writing here is fantastically sharp, to no small extent adopting airs of psychological drama as uneasy protagonist Clerici struggles with a distinct lack of self and conflicting notions of what is right and just. The stark, strident, violent repression of any vaguely different behavior or attitude as an immoral evil to be quashed, the hallmark of fascism, is emphatically set against the vibrant, jubilant individuality and freedom of the antifascist. As the preponderance of the runtime is steeped in the submissive, conformist, reactionary hues of what the protagonist has set out to do, the disparity is glaringly accentuated in later scenes set in Paris, especially at the dance hall bursting with wonderful, free-spirited vitality. And with that, the battle between ideologies is presented with horrific clarity: an endless fight, versus endless prostration, and in the middle, the useless, mindless centrism that shifts with the breeze.The story is helplessly grim and dreary, eliciting feelings of anger, sorrow, and outright revulsion at different points. This is true even as some characters and the scene writing in particular bear sparks that let us think in passing there may be an alternative outcome to the course of events. The structure of the plot is somewhat non-linear as the protagonist reflects on his path, and though it's lightly off-putting in the way it presents, the variation we get from one moment to the next cements viewer engagement and keeps the runtime from ever lagging. Through it all the cast is reliably solid, above all that stalwart of international cinema, Jean-Louis Trintignant, in his portrayal of impressionable Clerici. There's considerable nuance in Trintignant's performance that allows him to deftly shift as a scene requires, and it's abundantly clear why he was so highly esteemed.Between the violence, sex and nudity, and certainly the dire political themes, I can understand this won't readily appeal to everyone. On the other hand, that which is distasteful here is in part exactly what earns it a strong recommendation, to say nothing of the exceptional craft. It's a shame that international pictures, let alone titles older than at most 20 years, tend to be easily forgotten and overlooked, for there's tremendous value in the world of cinema stretching back to the silent era. There's much about 'The conformist' that should unsettle audiences, and deliberately so, but mark this for sure as a feature that deserves rediscovery, and more recognition at large. Don't go out of your way to see it per se, but if you have the opportunity to watch, this is well worth 2 hours of your time.",

            "content": "Bertolucci is another wunderkind in the industry, at the age of 30, his fourth feature film, THE CONFORMIST has been proved to be a timeless classic, which I feel privileged to watch it now for the very first time.Tilting camera angle, impeccable shots paralleling the moving train and zooming in from the external side of the window, sensual hues, cubistic buildings, punctilious light and shade deployment (Professor Quadri, the hunchbacked man being introduced by his silhouette), fluid ballroom dancing sequences, the bleak and cold-hearted manslaughter in a wintry woodland, all emerge as consecutive surprises and gustos along its non-linear narrative. Marcello (Trintignant), a newly-recruited fascist member in Rome, is assigned for an assassination of his old professor Quadri (Tarascio), who dwells in Paris now with her young wife Anna (Sanda), the film hops back and forth episodically in recounting the newly-wed Marcello's matrimony life with Giulia (Sandrelli), a petit bourgeois trophy wife; their honeymoon to Paris with a clandestine aim to carry out the task until Marcello compellingly falls for Anna; meanwhile Bertolucci allocates episodes to sort out Marcello's personal lives, his attachment with his amicable blind friend Italo (Quaglio), his drug-addicted mother (Milly) and lunatic father (Addobbati); but underneath his placid and gentile veneer, lies an unfading quandary, stems from his encounter with a pedophile (Cl\u00e9menti) in his childhood and his latent homosexuality which pulses him to a perpetual and professed seeking of normalcy. Trintignant is exceedingly under-appreciated in his sophisticated and self-constrained portrayal of a man put in contradiction with almost anything around him, perfectly tallies with the political message of the film, a stooge, put-upon in order to rectify his own weakness, indiscriminately clutches any straw to obey conformability, while in the end, a sense of loss and disparagement is his own bitter fruit. Sanda and Sandrelli are stunning in their own distinctive beauties, the former is resolute, swinging both ways and emanating the like-a-moth-to-a-flame fatalism; the latter imbues a more traditional feminine allure with little clue about what's in her husband's mind. Also it is noteworthy to give credit to Georges Delerue, who produced a spellbound score underlining the varying tenors of Marcello's state of mind. THE CONFORMIST is a pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistancer with its idiosyncratic aesthetic charisma to crown Bertolucci as the most important auteur in Italian cinema after his illustrious progenitors!",

            "review_title": "A gripping film about murder and the desire to be normal",
            "content": "The Conformist is a film about how a respectable Italian citizen, Marcello Clerici, is enlisted by the then fascist government to assist in the murder of a political dissident. The how and the why of this murder is revealed through shifting layers of narrative, with the film jumping back and forth in place and time in a manner that is at first diffuse and disorienting, but which becomes increasingly gripping as we learn more about the troubles pressing in on Marcello's psyche. Through the complex interweaving of narratives the viewer can reach towards some understanding of how Marcello's self-professed desire for 'normality' becomes the driving force behind his murderous actions.Marcello's difficult family background is portrayed early on through the encounters with his morphine-addicted mother and his insane, syphilis-stricken father. Marriage to Giulia, a middle-class woman, seems to offer the beginnings of a normal and respectable family life for our protagonist, but there are indications that this marriage is part of an uneasy fa\u00e7ade, covering the shame of a pre-pubescent homosexual encounter with a policeman known as Lino.Secret agent Manganiello, a shadowy representative of the fascist government, offers a further handhold on 'normality' when he enlists Marcello to assist in the murder of Professor Quadri, one of Marcello's former teachers. This mission is an opportunity for Marcello to become a proved servant of the government, to become 'normal', to conform. Before his marriage, Marcello confesses his sins to a priest and broaches the subject of this murderous assignment. The holy man's foremost concern is not the act of murder that is to be perpetrated, but rather the extent to which Marcello willed the homosexual encounter with Lino. His counsel is a damning indictment of the Catholic Church's collaboration with the fascist government.When Marcello travels to Paris and finds Professor Quadri, he struggles to face up to the brutal task ahead. And yet, though racked with doubts, he is unable to bring himself to rebel against the political and social model of fascist Italy. Marcello is inexorably drawn towards Quadri's striking wife, Anna, who also develops a near-erotic closeness to his own wife, captured in a mesmerising dance between the two women. The uncomfortable allure of infidelity wears dangerously against Marcello's desire to conform.Marcello's complicity in the murder of the professor and his wife is a perverted bid for 'normality' in a perverted society. The murder, captured on shaky hand-held camera, is a harrowing experience for him and for the viewer. And yet, having violated one set of morals, the eventual overthrow of the fascist dictatorship in Italy leaves Marcello with nothing to show for his sacrifice. It is only then that his cool, unemotional demeanour gives way to a show of desperate anger against his abusers.The daring structure adopted by director Bernardo Bertolucci is paired with amazing cinematography; slanted camera angles, inventive tracking shots and surreal episodes (including the blind people's party, a memorably bizarre vignette) are among the hallmarks of this film. Georges Delereu provides a brooding soundtrack to match the story. The Conformist is an intense piece of cinema, difficult to follow at times, but ultimately a gripping and unforgettable experience.",

Do not miss...Semi-Spoilers...The parents of Clerici, both seen briefly in two scenes that are connected, I think may also lie at the cold heart of Clerici's fascism. While this is just a story, I do think it is often the sons of the somewhat successful, who end up becoming sickened by and eventually fanatically renouncing their materialistic fortune. We first meet Clerici's overly self-indulgent mother, strung out in morphine heaven, and evidently having wandered into a foreign affair off the same opium trail (her valise \"Hemlock\" may in fact be Clerici's step-brother). We can assume Clerici's father has indeed been successful, the house they own while in disrepair is still stately; however his father is now in that stunning sanatorium, and as Clerici pushes his father to confront his own suspect and violent past, his father flees to an emotional embracing of his own straitjacket.Clerici however will have no such whimpering, he turns his eyes as blind as his friend Italo's. It seems to me, any strong devotion to a political party requires blindness, or at least a willingness to see things as they may not be. We learn this in the film as well, as the (real SPOILER, stop now!), first murder committed by the teenage Clerici was not a murder. Indeed at that point in the film, my first thought was that the scene in Lino's apartment did not happen at all. Clerici was being tormented by other kids, and there was some comment about pulling his pants down from the kids. Maybe that was the deep-seated shame that in a child's mine got warped into the revenge-dream with Lino, indeed the way that ended with the deus-ex-wind blowing Much of this film is fantastic, as in remarkableblack and white shadows, and clothing especially for Giulia as her world is so much more cut and dry.the dancing studio embrace, cloaking Clerici and Anna in bluethe visit to the minister's cavernous office-cum-museumAnna twice foreshadowed as the everywoman of Clerici's dreamswhile I've only seen patches of the Godfather series (long story), this certainly seemed to resonate with that, while the hunt and kill in the snowy woods seemed to inspire much later Soprano homage.Georges Delarue's score!!!choosing between the woman who completes you versus the one who compels youa blind fistfight, what a show of the clumsy futility of angerthe dancing line, shot overhead as a spiral crushing ClericiOthers here have made comments about the repressed homosexuality of Clerici, as being a driving force behind his fascism, I honestly didn't take that with me from the film, but I see how others could. Certainly misguided self-hatred often is what leads people over the brink towards hateful acts upon their fellow man. In the US, at least, the politician who doth protest too much against X, often is steeped in his own X.Much can be read into the film, I wish I had read the novel that inspired it all first, but then again maybe not. The film stands superbly over time. One more stunning scene involving a discussion of Plato has me hope that Bertolucci will be fueled by his philosophical fixation to adapt Jose Saramago's outstanding novel \"The Cave.\"9/10",

Participating in the assassination of an old acquaintance must have seemed so romantic and straightforward when it was just an abstract concept. Actually pulling the trigger once you've been out for drinks together, after your wives have bonded over Parisian fashion, that's another matter entirely.Speaking in a purely technical sense, The Conformist is a marvel. Gorgeously framed and lit, with trend-setting photography and a crisp eye for detail, it's stylish, radiant cinema that emphasizes and enhances the chosen mood of each important scene. I found the script to be less inspired. Particularly so during the drawn-out second act, where our spy endlessly hems and haws about making a decision. Any decision, that is, not just the big, fat one at the center of all the swirling intrigue. For most of his life, he's survived in a detached state, merely going with the flow (nay, conforming) to avoid rocking the boat; this time such deferrals do him no good, yet he persists. History is littered with such men, following orders or standing mute while atrocities are carried out in their name, and while that's a valid point, it's tirelessly beaten and bandied about. The film isn't terribly subtle about any of its messages, operating with a proud moral superiority that I found stiff and redundant. It's so concerned with being IMPORTANT that it can often feel like a lecture.Good as a thought-stirrer, and outstanding as a visual specimen, but overwrought and wearying as a total package.",

The acting is, insofar as I understand it, of a similarly high quality. Where the film falls down is in the plot and subject matter. The film is really a character study (of fascism) and the plot only really exists in order to put stress on the character. It is serviceable but nothing more, although it has a clever framing device that casts the entire film as a series of flashbacks experienced by the assassin as he chases down his prey. Where it falls flat for me is the nature of the character study, where the protagonist is supposed to stand in for fascism. He has a mad father and a decadent upper class mother (a morphine addict and lethargic adulteress), he nearly murdered a man as a boy, he was abused by a homosexual in his youth and is only capable of sexual activity after his wife confesses to having had a relationship with an older man. In order to deal with this he represses himself, seeking solace by marrying a silly middle class girl and trying for children and 'normality'. Hence, 'the conformist'. In the 1970s, when people still sought to explain Fascism through familial and sexual neurosis, this might have sounded sensible. Today, it sounds silly. After all, how many of the ex-Arditi, who became many of the first Blackshirts, could be described in such a manner?

He interweaves at certain junctures to link psychoanalysis, political ideology and even sex all together to give us a deep and profound film.Unlike '1900' which I found too blatant and cumbersome at times, Bertolucci presents the viewer with a more accurate and diverse set of characters and situations. The script is of a high-calibre with much philosophising, throw in with that great performances from Trintignant and the sensual and sexy actresses that accompany him and the viewer finds a timeless classic that really effectively portrays the political positions of so many 'conformists' in 20th century Europe.This is a skillful and intelligent film brought to so by a true auteur in Bertolucci.",

Dated is the word that comes to mind.The most dated parts are the style, choppy to the point of almost being disjointed (though every scene does work from the other, the transitions are rough and painful) and even the \"shocker\" Lesbian undercurrent, which in the 70's may have been daring, now just looks added on, since it really doesn't meld well to the plot other than to show how those crazy socialist liberals will do anything to feed their desires and subvert the morals of innocents in the process.Boring I suppose is ultimately the term that defines The Conformist, a beautiful, elegant, brainy, but boring account of a life no one will ever accuse of being well lived.Perhaps it says more about me and what the time has done for me, but the best part of the movie for me this time around was the story of Stefania Sandrelli's Guilia whose dresses are magnificent bold patterns albeit a tad black and white in contrast to the ambiguity around her.Oh well, Thomas Wolfe said it well, \"You can't go home again.\"",

            "content": "A beautiful looking film which I read about once that it cost only 700 million Lira to make in 1969. According to Yahoo's currency conversion, 700M Lira is $334K today and I believe that would make it about what, $50K (give or take a few Ks) in 1969?  It's amazing what talented people can do with just a little money. There are movies made today that probably cost a hundred times what this one cost in 1969 and don't look anywhere near as good.Even though this film was made in 1969, I still consider it a 1970s film and one of the best of the '70s. This movie has been referred to as a Marxist \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939) and it is without a doubt one of the nicest looking films ever made. Especially its first half, and I believe its first half outshines the rest of it. Let's also give the most credit not to the director but to the talented Cinematographer of this film, Vittorio Storaro.The only draw back in this film is its story line -- it's extremely heavy handed. Well at least to me. I found it somewhat irritating, but then what do you expect from a film made at the time by dedicated Marxists.As for a detailed analysis of this film's story I suggest you read its other reviews at this Web page or buy the book \"Italian Cinema : From Neorealism to the Present\" by Peter Bondanella.The music in this movie is also very good and it's a perfect example of the proper use of music in a movie: It's used when needed and to enhance a scene, not simply to reinforce the emotions being displayed on the screen or as endless background sound. There aren't many films made today that know how to properly blend music within a film. If you can think of other good examples then let the rest of us know.Favorite scenes in this film: About in the middle, right after Anna Quadri (Dominique Sanda) confronts Marcello (Jean-Louis Trintignant) about why he must murder her father (Marcello's old anti-Fascist university professor). It's just a simple scene of them (Marcello, his wife, and Anna) beginning to shop in Paris but it's a beautiful mix of great cinematography, editing and music. Or how about the scene in a compartment of a moving train with Marcello and his new wife. Again very effective and very impressive.If you like the way this film looks then I recommend another Italian film you may want to see: \"C'eravamo tanto amati\"  or \"We All Loved Each Other So Much\" (1974). This is another extremely nice looking film and some text book examples of clever film making.",

            "review_title": "The Life of a Fascist",
            "content": "What can yet be said about Bernardo Bertolucci's The Conformist? With the director's other 1970 release, The Spider's Stratagem, it forms a diptych about fascism in Italy. Whereas the latter questioned the truth behind the creation of anti-fascist heroes, the former is a character study of an Italian fascist who plans to spy on his former socialist University teacher. Marcello Clerici is a young man, about to get married, and he wants to live like a normal man: for him marriage is one way of achieving such normalcy; so is joining the fascist party. He wants order and stability. Little did he know that his plan would plunge him into the moral crisis of his existence.Journeying to Paris on the pretext of honeymooning, he plans to befriend his old teacher and learn all he can about him. But on the way the plan is changed and now he is in charge of killing him. To make things worse, he loves the teacher's wife and would gladly run away with her.Through a delicately-crafted non-linear narrative, Bertolucci leads the viewer on a journey to Marcello's past to learn what shaped him into the type of man he is now. Although the narrative itself is fascinating, this is perhaps the weakest part of the movie. Bertolucci gives us the lowdown on the stereotypical fascist: a broken house, an unhappy childhood, almost raped by a male chauffeur. At least he didn't make him overtly homosexual, although many think he's a repressed one. Provided the viewer ignores these simplistic takes on the mentality of a fascist person, the movie is actually quite modern.First of all there is Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, which is arguably the most beautiful in any movie ever made. Storaro uses the camera and the filters with intelligence and grace, in the way he shoots interior scenes or captures the colours of a sunset or the mist in a cold morning. Each frame deserves to be in an art gallery.Next there is the spectacular performance by Jean-Louis Trintignant. He's one of my favourite actors and also one of the most coherent ones. I've never seen him give a bad performance in a movie, whether he's a leading or a supporting character. Here he's the heart of the movie, playing a tortured man who doesn't quite now how to achieve peace. He's a nasty piece of work, but he also manages to get a lot of sympathy for his role.The newcomer Dominique Sanda is perhaps better known for her performance in The Garden of the Finzi-Contini (also in 1970), but I like her more in this movie. She's a sexy, hardened woman who can see through Marcello's lies and yet tries not to give up on him. Both these actors put to shame most of the people pretending to act nowadays.Finally, there's a timelessness about this story that makes The Conformist modern. Although Bertolucci is sometimes reviled as a communist filmmaker, this movie is hardly a hymn to socialism; it's just a condemnation of any regime that brainwashes people into seeking security in lies. In a key scene, Marcello and the teacher discuss Plato's Allegory of the Cave to demonstrate this idea. It's an idea worth rediscovering in our own times.",

            "content": "Films that double as if they are art on a canvas are some of the richest and most beautiful things that can come out of cinema, Il Conformista or The Conformist in English is exactly that. It not only has a very good story but in general looks stunning, the film is known for its camera angles but also its use of colour and the general production design that also catches the eye. From Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci comes this excellent piece and it is essential for any budding director or cinematographer that they witness the skill level put into this. The film is basically all about Fascism and shows a man sent on a mission to take out a former professor of his who is too anti-fascist for the regime of Italy in the 1930's. The film sounds much like a spy thriller and although in ways he is a spy, this is not all about exciting action, no this is dramatic and thrilling but does not require shootouts to entertain, it uses artistry, a solid script and characters who could be studied for many an hour.Marcello Clerici is the main person in this movie and is just as Fascist as your next Fascist, this man is willing to give things up to carry out the mission set out for him and important things that come his way in life do not stand a chance against his belief in normality and Fascism. The most intriguing character is for me not Clerici but the professor's wife Anna who is shrouded in mystery, we never truly know much about her but the way she is used in the story is fascinating. It uses many different people to get the story across whether within his friend, his Fascist overseer of sorts or his soon to be wife Giulia and that is really what makes this complex.It is impossible not to talk about the way this movie looks after you have seen it with Bertolucci and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro creating something truly remarkable and although this could easily be called pointless angles, they actually do convey emotion or set the tone of the scene that is at hand. This film could be also get called pretentious but really it is not, many a film can use artistic elements in a way which is begging for awards but this feels different though. It actually tells a story alongside the beauty on the technical side of things and Bertolucci makes full use of that to create an interesting but also good looking piece of cinema.As for the actors well it is of course Jean-Louis Trintignant as Clerici who is fantastic among all involved but do not take anything away from other cast. Stefania Sandrelli as Giulia is good and although at first can feel annoying starts to grow on you as the movie progresses and becomes a well worked character. I particularly liked the character of Manganiello played by Gastone Moschin who as the overseer I mentioned is just a great character and one that usually turns up in some major scenes of the film.So The Conformist, adapted from the 1951 novel of the same name and given an artistically wonderful showing on the big screen, having never read the novel at the time of viewing I cannot say whether it is a true adaption but it does not matter to me if a book is made a little differently on the big screen. Bertolucci nailed this one and this could be said to be his best ever work, what stops it from being perfect is maybe some parts of the beginning and it can have a slow pace at a few places but nevertheless this movie is excellent and one that is just a fine piece, finely done.",

            "content": "There are many various arguments over what truly makes a good film. However, there is no denying that the mark of a truly great film is that it gets better with a repeated viewing. What's so amazing about THE CONFORMIST is that not only does it get better and better, but that it was already great the first time. I could easily go on about the technical brilliance, so I beg forgiveness from the reader for any ranting that occurs in my review. First, there is the photography by the consistently brilliant Vittoro Storaro, who not only aims for beauty, but also for effect; fascist Italy never looked so cold, but Paris has never looked more beautiful. The imagery feel almost like a mixture of memories, the present, and a dream. What CITIZEN KANE did for B&W cinematography, THE CONFORMIST did for color. Really, the only bad thing about the photography is that it's so good that it distracts from the aplenty greatness found in other elements of the film. It is what feels the closest to being \"escapist\" in this movie, since it is so perfect that even blinking feels like a crime, robbing the eyes of the beauty before them for that fraction of a second they were closed.There's also the haunting score by Georges Delerue. I admit that music isn't really my specialty, so I will not be able to go into too much detail about the music; I can only say that it is simple enough as to not be overbearing, but beautiful enough to stay in one's head for long after the story is complete. It creates a sort of aural nostalgia. Has music been better? Yes. Is it usually, however? No.Let's not forget the acting: there have been few films with such perfectly cast leads. Jean-Louis Trintignant nails the part of Marcello Clerici. Without so much as speaking a single word, the audience can see that this is a truly distressed man, begging the question from the start, \"What is haunting this man so?\" As great as Marcello is played, the most notable character is the enigmatic, sensual Anna. Even without the \"flashbacks\" Bertolucci added, her face is one that that everybody has seen. She's the girl in the white dress in CITIZEN KANE, who was seen, long ago, for a brief second, yet there is not a month that goes by that her memory is neglected. She is performed perfectly by Dominique Sandra, whose bright eyes pierce the soul every time the camera lingers on her beautiful face. While those performances are the most memorable, the supporting cast is not too terribly overshadowed, and remains superior to most movies. The most controversial technical element would be the editing, where there is a debate over whether the non-linear storytelling adds or distracts from the film. I'll admit, the first time I saw this, it diminished some of the quality. Upon the second time, I really didn't mind, and the third time, I was in love. It really adds to the film in ways that cannot be expressed in words; the best way I can put it is that the editing makes the film seem more real, as if the audience was actually in the place of Marcello. All of this leads me to the screenplay writer and the director, Bernardo Bertolucci. He is truly a person who understands people. The book by Alberto Moravia was just fine, but Bertolucci improved greatly upon it, especially with the ending (one of the greatest in my opinion). The great part about this movie is that it doesn't rely solely upon technical brilliance; it instead evolves into one of the most haunting experiences ever experienced on screen. This particularly felt true to me in the childhood scenes. The story of my life was almost nothing like that of Marcello: I was never molested, I certainly did not grow up in the elite class, and I was part of the \"normal\" family that he so strives for his whole life. However, I felt like that could have been me. There has never been any other film that has had this effect upon me. Other movies feel like they should have, but only this film succeeds. When the film finishes, I am left with a feeling that no other film has left me with, which is why this is still the film that I consider to be the greatest ever made. Nothing seems forced (except for maybe Marcello's dreams). THE CONFORMIST isn't one of those films that I knew was great, but I didn't really care for. It is that rare gem that stays with me, and remains constantly great. Would I recommend this film to everyone? Certainly not. However, for anyone who is serious about film, this is absolutely required for multiple viewings.",

This was filmed in 1969 and dealt with the fascist 1930s and 40s, but the betrayals the protagonist commits in order to fit into society are of a type with all such betrayals. In our era of lock-step thinking (right AND left, although right now I'm feeling that right-wing pinch a bit more painfully than the left-wing pinch), THE CONFORMIST makes for uncomfortable viewing. The acting is fine. The stand-out presence is that of Dominique Sanda. She has a Dietrich thing going on. I knew right away we were supposed to like her. Dietrich would have been remembered, in 1970, first as an anti-Nazi and THEN as a film star. Cinematic short-hand; but why not? The scene in the snow-covered forest is harrowing.

Much of what happens in the main body of the narrative is simultaneously convoluted (with various intello-political ideas tossed about) and essentially predictable. The end appears to make a decisive statement about Fascism and conformity, but... well, doesn't really. It's certainly a visually magnificent film, an early effort by Vittorio Storaro who would later direct photography on Apocalypse Now and the Last Emperor.

            "content": "'The Conformist' is an engrossing, if extraordinarily difficult film; I haven't met a person yet who has been able to comprehend all the nuances and unravel all of its layers on a first viewing. The narrative is non-linear, making vivid use of flashback inter cut with the unfolding of the film's climax, creating a dreamy, hypnotic atmosphere, laced with menace, oppression and tension.Many of Bertolucci's films explore politics: 'The Conformist', on the surface, is an obvious indictment of Fascism, using imagery, metaphor, irony and gallows humour to mercilessly expose its flaws while always retaining a sincerity and honesty in exploring how Fascism managed to function and progress.The film could have been heavy handed, juggling such a massive topic with other secondary themes; but Bertolucci's success lies in the fact that he never wanders from the character of Marcello Clerici (played wonderfully by Jean-Louis Trintignant)and his personal strive for 'normality' - an ideal that Bertolucci with great care and precision shows to be misguided in its very concept: for what is normality? By concentrating on one specific storyline - that of Clerici's mission to assassinate his old professor, who is in self-imposed exile in Paris and engaging in anti-Fascist activities, Bertolucci manages to examine Fascism in more depth and with more success than any 'epic' biography of Hitler or historical drama.It has to be the sign of a great director, then, that this is achieved at the same time as making a masterpiece of cinematic technique - and accolades here must also be shared with Vittorio Storaro, the cinematographer. His palette - of vivid, artificial blues, blacks, harsh whites, yellows, browns, and in the opening scene alone, neon red, makes for a visual feast so sumptuous that in a restored print, 'The Conformist' is breathtaking to behold. But unlike other films that boast beautiful cinematography for its own sake, here, even these opulent colours are used as extensions of theme and character.Much has been written about Marcello Clerici, but it is undoubtedly Anna Quadri, played to perfection by Dominique Sanda, that is the great enigma of 'The Conformist'. What are her intentions? Her motivations? Why does she do the things she does? At times, she seems perfectly sincere: a vehement anti-Fascist who loves her husband and is disgusted by the far-right. I believe these ideals to be sincere. But Anna Quadri is a complex, mysterious character. Marcello notices that she resembles a prostitute he met earlier when receiving new orders concerning his old professor, Anna's husband. We notice the resemblance too \u2013 and also realise that she appears similar to yet another prostitute earlier in the film, whom a Fascist government official was toying with on his desk. It is ridiculous to suggest that Anna Quadri could possibly be either of these two women, but the resemblance was obviously meant to be noticed. It throws us off guard the moment we meet Anna; she is impetuous, dangerous, sphinxlike.That she is playing games with Marcello, we have no doubt. Anna admits that she knew from the get-go (along with her husband) that Clerici was a Fascist spy. She is trying to trap him, to entice him, and persuade him to forsake his mission. Her husband uses small tricks and political speeches; she uses sex and emotional blackmail. That she is a ballet teacher is quite apt - she is a master of pose, performance, and seduction, and she knows it.Marcello, of course, is the conformist of the title. This is his story and his tragedy; his speeches revealing his motivations and his confessions could have been written by a 21st century Shakespeare, in that they have a surface lucidity concealing beneath them universes of anguish and desperation. What impact have his parents had on his character? His sexual trauma at thirteen years old? What about Quadri leaving for Paris while the young Marcello was writing his thesis - he seems quite angry about this? Every scene in 'The Conformist' is lovingly realised and brought to the screen - together, Bertolucci and Storaro fill the shot with an abundance of detail, paying particular attention to the cold, impersonal geometry of Fascist architecture, the apartments of the middle classes and the mansions of the upper classes. Bertolucci proves his love for film in his references and homages to his heroes, the directors of the French New Wave (particularly Truffaut, Godard and Resnais) among others: these can be seen especially in the camera work and editing - the odd angles (reminiscent of Reed's 'The Third Man') as Marcello walks to his mother's decaying mansion, a painting fading into the scene it depicts, an amazingly inventive and tense chase through wintry woodland using a hand-held camera, accentuating the sound of a gun shot in contrast to the muted sounds of knives in an assassination vividly reminiscent of Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar'.My favourite scenes include Professor Quadri giving a speech to Marcello, heavily making use of metaphor to explain the workings of Fascism, accompanied with some inspired symbolic imagery involving a shadow on the wall dissolving in sunlight, the party of the 'blind' - an obvious pun by Bertolucci to imply the blindness of Fascism itself, and an amazing sequence in a dance hall later on which emphasises Marcello's role as an outsider. It is ironic to think that the more he tries to conform, the more he distances himself from society and falls deeper into isolation. As the film ends, and he peers behind him into the darkness, Italy's future after the fall of Mussolini murky and uncertain, Marcello is left angry, guilty and scared; but more than that, because of his flawed, doomed plight for 'normality', he is left desperately, painfully alone.",

            "content": "***It has spoilers, but EThompsonUMD (\"An unforgettable masterpiece. Finally available on DVD!!!!!!\", EThompsonUMD from Massachusetts, 25 February 2005) has a nice review. I also like the comments by italtrav (\"Brilliant film making\", italtrav from NYC, 23 June 2004). Another fine review is from junkielee (\"Masterpiece!!\", junkielee from Cairo, Egypt, 7 November 2013).*** The Conformist (1970, Bernardo Bertolucci), a return to Benito Mussolini\ufeff's Italy\ufeff, is profound, one of the great cinematic achievements of the last century. Filled with ideas, oozing with style, relevant to societies (like the US today) on the verge of total collapse and richly satisfying, Bernardo Bertolucci\ufeff's eye-opener invites passionate discussion on its meaning.Set during the rise and fall of Mussolini, \"The Conformist\" follows a young Italian man Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant\ufeff, who is actually French), who aspires to become a made-man with the Fascists. To get in, Marcello must enable the assassination of his former philosophy professor, now a prominent democracy-activist. The narrative is non-linear, and we soon realize that Marcello is repressed. He has strong homosexual tendencies. He is particularly haunted by a major incident in his childhood; i.e., thirteen-year-old Marcello has his first sexual encounter with a man and it leads to a violent conclusion. As an adult Marcello is determined to be regarded as normal, so he marries the extremely pretty and sensual Giulia ( Stefania Sandrelli\ufeff), even though he hates her lack of intellectual depth. When the couple are honeymooning, he makes arrangements to meet up with Professor Quadri (Enzo Tarascio). He is instantly floored by Quadri's beautiful, bisexual wife, Anna (Dominique Sanda). Although Marcello quickly makes a pass with her, it seems he is more attracted by her liberation. As Marcello, Giulia, the Professor and Anna become more intimately acquainted with each other the more the very awake Anna reveals herself as the most compelling character of all. Will Marcello go through with it? Visually it looks amazing. The combination of Bertolucci and famed cinematographer Vittorio Storaro\ufeff is dazzling. Bertolucci really chooses color well. Storaro is the master of under-exposure. The combination of Bertolucci's imagery and Storaro's cinematography creates a sense that you are watching living history unfold.Another reviewer points out that Bertolucci is deviating from the Alberto Moravia\ufeff novel which has an omniscient perspective. Instead, Bertolucci focuses on the troubled, unreliable Marcello for point of view. There are many examples where Bertolucci suggests a peculiar mindset. For example, Marcello has a thug beat up his drug-addicted Mother's chauffeur and lover. Curiously, the man taking the beating does not resist. (In other words, victims are not really being victimized.) When Marcello meets his father in a sanitarium, it appears like the father's agitation is being directed in opposition to Marcello's obvious connection with the Fascists. (That is, resisting the Fascists is a crazy thing to do.) When Marcello is announcing his intention to marry Giulia to be perceived as normal, he is in a nightclub with singers performing in the background. (So the distracted audience fails to notice Marcel is repressed or strange in any way.) However, perhaps the most visually identifying moment for Marcello follows a very erotic dance between Anna and Giulia in a nightclub. Their dancing arouses all the other patrons. Eventually all the patrons are dancing in one large circle clockwise around Marcello. At the center of the storm, Marcello is turning counter-clockwise, refusing to be pulled in with the senseless pleasure experienced by those around him. Shortly after the circle dance Marcello commits his perfidy. So, he wasn't a conformist after all. His move towards Fascism wasn't out of cowardice; he had the courage to resist the rest. He never deceived anyone; the others were not paying attention.An interesting theme is Plato\ufeff's Allegory of the Cave. This was the subject of Marcel's graduate thesis. The scene with Marcello discussing it in Professor Quadri's office, with the two bathed in shadow, directly comments on it. Plato's allegory is also relevant to the late betrayal of the blind Fascist radio announcer. Just as Plato's narrator suddenly perceives reality after a lifetime of staring at shadows, so too does the blind propagandist learn the awful truth about a perceived comrade he has never seen.\"The Conformist\" works on so many levels that it should be seen whenever possible. Here's a closing thought for those who think that joining a Secret Police is so damn cool: There exists someone like Anna in every life that makes attachment with strangers worthwhile.",

            "content": "The film is a case study in the psychology of fascism: Marcello Clerici is a bureaucratic man deformed by a dysfunctional middle class family and a childhood sexual trauma. He accepts an assignment from Mussolini's secret police to assassinate his former mentor, living in exile in Paris. In Trintignant's characterization, you can see Alberto Moravia's portrait of a man willing to sacrifice his values in the interests of building a so-called \"normal life.\"[3] According to the documentary Visions of Light the film is widely praised as a visual masterpiece. It was photographed by Vittorio Storaro, who used rich colors, authentic wardrobe of the 1930s, and a series of unusual camera angles and fluid camera movement. According to film critic and author Robin Buss, the cinematography suggests Clerici's inability to conform with \"normal\" reality: the reality of the time is \"abnormal.\"[4] Also, Bertolucci's cinematic style synthesizes expressionism and \"fascist\" film aesthetics. Its style can be compared with classic German films of the thirties, such as in Leni Riefenstahl's The Triumph of the Will and Fritz Lang's Metropolis.[5]The drama was influential to other filmmakers: the image of blowing leaves in The Conformist, for example, influenced a very similar scene in The Godfather, Part II by Francis Ford Coppola (1974).",

            "review_title": "The best film I've ever seen.",
            "content": "I rented this movie from the local library, and ended up keeping it for nearly a month, watching it over and over again, running scenes over and over again in my mind when I wasn't watching it.As has been commented on by many, an astonishingly beautiful film. This movies is all about the Storaro's cinematography. Forget the politics of it, this movie could be about anything. In the director's commentary, Bertolucci says it was his first film he did in which he felt like an adult. However, the politics of it seem like those of a very young man, and just aren't all that relevant.Also the musical score is not remarked upon enough - utter melancholy grandeur. The highlight of it is how it is used right at the onset to the flashback to the main character's childhood.Everyone remarks about Dominque Sanda in this film, and of course you see her in subsequent Bertolucci films as well, but to me this movie is all about Stefania Sandrelli.Stefania Sandrelli dances the \"bossa nova\" (or whatever it is) by herself in her apartment near the beginning of the film. I don't know what it is about it but I could not stop watching it.Other noteworthy scenes: -The ground-level shot of windblown leaves (remarked upon by many).-The static shot of the Eiffel Tower in the early morning fog as the main character is driving off to kill his professor (actually a flash forward near the beginning of the film). It only lasts like three seconds. It reminds me of an early scene in Braveheart, the first scene we see of the adult William Wallace, and he is galloping his horse in front of a mountainous background in the Scottish Highlands. That scene as well lasts like three seconds but it was when I first realized that Braveheart was a very special film (OK don't throw out the rest of this because of that comment - Braveheart Rules.) -Stefania Sandrelli and Dominique Sanda window shopping in Paris. Also I love that dog \"Robi\", a giant Shnauzer I believe.I should also note that this is the best film dubbing I've seen in any film, and the dubbed version is to me superior to the subtitled version. I think the lead actor was actually speaking French and was dubbed anyway (not sure about that though) but dubbing is something the Italians have a lot of experience with. The dubbed version is very expressive, and also gives the film a slightly goofy attribute that I think is an asset for some reason. The film just seems much more serious in the natural languages.In all honesty, it seems as if Bertolucci kept trying to recapture the magic of this film for the rest of his career. Here is one of many examples: In the final third of the film The main character goes to a dance hall with his old professor (whom he is thinking about killing) and their respective wives. The light emanating from the dance hall glows like a beacon in the dark blue Paris night as the two woman run ahead towards it. They enter and Dominque Sanda says, \"Its time to dance\", and she and Stefania Sandrelli start dancing the Tango together. The whole sequence is incredibly beautiful and directly mirrors the final third of Bertolucci's very next film, Last Tango in Paris. So anyway, I think Bertolucci knew very well what he had in this film (as well as what he had in cinematographer Storraro). In my opinion Last Tango is so pornographic as to be unwatchable (for me anyway) but Conformist does not have that type of sensationalism we see in Bertolucci's subsequent works.Its amazing to me how in many cases a director's strongest film by far is very early in his career, and he never truly matches that accomplishment again. Another example of this is Taxi Driver which to me is by far Scorsese's strongest film, also the film of a very young man, and a film which he never really equaled again (although Goodfellas is pretty good.)",

            "content": "I saw The Conformist on Turner Classic Movies several days ago (Sept., 2006), after not seeing it since the early 70s. I had several seemingly vivid memories from it, stemming from some of the magnificently imaginative visuals, but was shocked by how little I actually remembered of the movie. The Turner Classic Movies host, with whom we are all familiar, and who does such a good job of hosting, and giving off the air of a movie expert, mentioned Bertolucci's recent Dreamers, then said that compared with it, The Conformist is \"not racy at all.\" Now we know that he hasn't seen all the movies he introduces! Somebody commented that Marcello was raped by his chauffeur, and somebody else noted that no sex actually took place (though the scene was surely \"racy\"). I assume it was not Marcello's chauffeur, since the two introduced themselves to each other while in the car.Others have mentioned favorite scenes, such as the ladies' tango, and the blowing leaves, and I certainly concur with those. I'll bring up a couple I liked that have not been mentioned: when Giulia does her coquettish dance to the record that someone brought back \"from America\", lifting one hand and foot and then the other to the sexy rhythm; the shopping scene in Paris (which someone did mention), beginning with a focus on the cat's head on Anna's fur, then shifting to her dog's head. (Was it a Bouvier des Flandres, or maybe a black Briard?) Somebody commented that the movie began in Italy, but the first scene is actually a flash forward to the hotel in Paris, with Marcello waiting for his phone call. Of course you don't know this until you see the same hotel later, and its name, when Giulia and Marcello are honeymooning there.It's certainly a stimulating and powerful movie, but I can see why some were put off by the coldness of the protagonist, reflected throughout much of the movie. Dominique Sanda was just amazing. I remember Pierre Clementi (the chauffeur), from Belle de Jour.",

(Sigh).All that explained, The Conformist is a textbook for cinematographers and it revolutionized 70s and 80s production design.  Some of the set pieces remain unrivaled, and any student of Art Deco or Futurism will have an eye orgy.Sometimes the psychology is a bit textbook and lacking subtlety, but Jean-Louis T. and the lovely Dominique Sanda gloss over it all, as does Georges Delerue's mournful score.This one gets four stars.",

            "content": "Marcello, played by an impassive and stylish Jean-Louis Trintignant, is disgusted with his parents, contemptuous of his fianc\u00e9e, and detached from his society. His sole desire is to feel like and pass as a normal person. He volunteers in a Fascist scheme against a former professor who is engaged in opposition activity in exile in Paris. While there, an attraction to the non-conformist and sexy wife of his professor and memories of a past he would rather forget complicate his plans.This is a movie where most of the main characters are sexy and cool and exciting, most of all the lead. Despite the supposition that Marcello is repressed and struggling to be as generic as possible, he comes across as self-aware, intense, and somewhat mephistophelian. Stephanie Sandrelli as his silly but well adapted to society wife and Dominique Sanda as his professor's intriguing, sexually liberated wife are both beautiful and entertaining. Despite that objectively the main character and his goals are ugly, the movie moves from one spectacular set piece to another amid an air of excitement.On the other hand, this is a film that seemed more impressive to me watching when fifteen years younger. The characters motivations often seem not so much mysterious as just not making much sense. Is Marcello supposed to be in love with the professor's wife or really a homosexual? Is she really attracted to him? And then, would Marcello really go around explicitly announcing his intentions all the time if he were so \"repressed\"? And for the film, too, maybe it would be better not to beat the horse so much? Then to the ideas that sexual repression cause fascism feel dated, and even more so the suggestion that it's all due to his being molested. There is the sense that we're less learning something about fascism or sexual psychology as we are participating ourselves in some confused sado-masochistic / spectacular turn on. The film is impressive but questionable if genuinely as deep as it passes for. It's a very enjoyable film that still encapsulates for me a lot of the excitement of cinema and would recommend to anyone who wants to watch a fun, cool film, but overall not really serious or a must-see except for its influence.",

            "content": "The question this movie poses, {as did its source, the novel from which it is adapted, The Conformist by Alberto Moravia}, is why would a man, educated in both philosophy and the classics, want to forgo his capacity to be a freethinker and critic, and instead, identify with an immoral, vulgar, corrupt, totalitarian political consciousness, we know from the unfolding of events, to be the case in Italy's version of Nazism, that is the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini.The subject of the movie, a late 1930's Roman radio producer and Fascist propagandist, named Marcello Clerici, is personally ambitious to rise in the political hierarchy and improve his position in the Fascist society in which history and destiny have placed him. The Colonel whose assistance he seeks seems surprised that he is not the typically corrupt, immoral, or driven by greed type, whom he says they usually attract.Marcello in an exchange with his best friend Italo, {a blind, intellectual cynic, who broadcasts Fascist propaganda, on the radio}, informs him of his forthcoming marriage to a pretty but vacuous young petit bourgeois woman, with whom he shares nothing in common,, but he emphasizes the attraction to be her normality. Italo is amazed that a person so different from the \"hoi polloi\" as Marcello is, would want to be \"normal\".The central theme of this movie is then addressed, with a flashback sequence to Marcello's childhood, {in true Freudian style} , and we are shown the pivotal scene of a 13 year old Marcello, effeminately dressed being bullied in the playground by his peers. He walks disconsolately on the road, while his chauffeur in true haute bourgeois style follows behind him in the family limousine. The 13 year old Marcello then finds himself the victim of homosexual abuse {possibly sodomy} at the hands of the homosexual chauffeur called Lino. In Freud's seduction theory {which the auteur Bertolucci and the creator Moravia were both familiar with} childhood traumas and abuse would become the basis for adult neurosis and lead to otherwise inexplicable and aberrant adult behavior. This event and the phantasy's that were formed to allow the subconscious to deal with this trauma become the perverse condition which force Marcello to abandon his developed capacity to differentiate between acts that enhance the existential reality and those that degrade - those that according to his insane father, {a fantastic sequence in the asylum} cause \"slaughter and misery\"..The movie then changes genre, and location. Marcello and his empty- headed wife go to Paris on a twofold mission - both to honeymoon and to perform his Fascist mission of eliminating his former philosophy tutor Professor Quadri. The movie now becomes a conspiracy-thriller as the Professor's beautiful and intelligent wife, a sexual libertine, has dalliances with both Marcello {who for the first time has genuine emotion towards this manly {virago} woman. Anna Quadri,also in turn, seduces Giulia Clerici, {Marcello's wife}, and the seduction motif is carried forward. Hovering in the background at all times is the coarse, vulgar Fascist henchman Manganiello, a swarthy brute, who is there to see that Marcello does not lose courage and chicken out of his assignment. He says in true Nazi style that he hates cowards, homosexuals and Jews.The camera is always lyrical and the set pieces beautifully choreographed, as this amazingly dense movie moves on to the end of Mussolini's tyranny and a final sequence, where Marcello finds himself faced with the reality that his memory of the events of his childhood were false, and his mental structure that he had created to deal with the trauma, {that is his identification with authority and normality} were all illusion and delusion. The realization that he had ruined his destiny and his life drives him over the edge.Wow, what a movie, on so many levels and so influential {one immediately thinks of The Godfather} I, personally was stunned by the experience.",

Dominique Sanda walks along a corridor and strikes a scornful pose in the doorway of a room like someone parading on the catwalk. Jean-Louis Trintignant walks along the pavement in front of an art deco building as the camera tracks with him in a wintry twilight. At the corner he stops, turns, gestures. A vintage car rolls up. So chic. The acting is stylish. It has that operatic largeness that we get in Visconti's later films. You can see the actors' performances from the balcony. At first all this attention to style is beguiling. There is a strange scene in an insane asylum filmed in the EUR complex. It looks oppressive and futuristic and dream-like, like a scene from 8 \u00bd, but it becomes apparent that all this attention to style has no meaning. It is style for styles sake. At the end of one scene a shot is stitched on of autumnal leaves blown ominously along. What could it mean? Is it the \"Wind of Change\"? No, it's just leaves whisked about for visual pleasure. Who are we to scorn visual pleasures you may say, but the problem is that, at its worst, the visual pleasures begin to lead the action. The viewer begins to sense that a beautiful image was visualised and then a scene written to incorporate it. The characters' motivation is apparently to complete compositions or visual effects. Unfortunately for the viewer The Conformist is not content with stylish shallowness and tries to achieve depth or insight with what turns out to be a Freudian kitsch. There is a veritable cesspool of confusing childhood sexual experiences giving rise to bizarre adult behaviours. Fascism itself is some kind of psycho-sexual fantasy. It's all so very chic and depraved. Sadly we don't so much witness character development as a bunch of ids bumping against each other. It makes for tiresome viewing and tells us nothing about the psychology of Fascism or anything else that might give the film purpose. The Conformist looks good, sometimes thrillingly so, but it is weighed down by its rather dated psycho-sexual approach to character. The story suffers worst of all, being completely squeezed out by these other dominant elements.",

Not reacting in a way you would naturally expect from the situation.

In the movie his motivation is non existent. He just goes from one scene to another and reacts to his surroundings. Occasionally he is even verbally expressing his desires. What's the point of showing the scene with Lino if it does not affect him in any way during the course of the movie? In the book this is the single most important event of his life influencing many of his decisions both directly and indirectly.I salute the attempt to twist the modern Italian classic, but to my knowledge this could have been done much more sound and interesting.

From Arcali's editing strategy to Scarfiotti's design to Storaro's lighting, brilliant casting and performances, and of course Bertolucci's direction, the production is world class and timeless.  Many classic scenes: Sandrelli's retelling of her deflowering on the train and of course Sandrelli and Sanda's tango...Bertolucci and Arcali here make pretenders like Lynch and particularly Tarantino look like the pretentious hacks they are.Fused with Bertolucci's musings on Plato's cave allegory and ruminations on psycho-sexual behavior and politics, this film dares to go where the vast corpus of directors can't even dream of venturing.",

            "content": "What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? In a 1938 politically unstable Europe, a weak-willed Italian man becomes a fascist flunky who goes abroad to arrange the assassination of his old teacher, now a political dissident. Il Conformista is a work of art that's as close to flawless as one can get. It's dapper, sophisticated, sexy, compelling and dearly cosmopolitan, whilst being metaphorical and gripping. And, moreover, for a subject matter than little of the audience will have any personal or sentimental connection with, it's deeply powerful and engrossing. Il Conformista paints the portrait of a bohemian, artistic and edging closer-to rapture Europe yet still highlights through intricate narrative, an in-depth character study of the weak willed, the distressed and the deluded a Europe that is on a political tether. In its parades and its dances, through its screams and its silence, Il Conformista is a masterpiece that connects the now and then, conflicting desires, oozing style and a confused culture in more colour, more grit and more eloquence than the proclaimed greats of yonder years ever managed to. The climactic ending is a highlight with an almost perpetual aftertaste, where the conformist himself (Jean-Louis Trintignant) undertakes the assassination of his former mentor in a misty, dimly lit wood, a setting to quench the thirst of Arthur Conan-Doyle, as the victim's wife, a former lover, screams bitterly. Our conformist relaxes, his hat shadowing his face, his eyes glinting with thoughts of a million facets pouring over them. Il Conformista is littered with endless examples of seductive cinematography, bold and inviting colour schemes, elaborate musical ventures and stylistically superior heights than anything I've ever seen. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, Il Conformista is a thriller, and it certainly is thrilling, to say the least. To an impatient viewer, Il Conformista has whole other arsenal dimension of scenes that focus on deceit, murder, ill-intention and metaphorical dissidence. To a historian, the way that the portrayed era's political climate is capitalised on and exploited for dramatic effect is staggeringly remarkable. And lastly, to an artist, Bertolucci's genius behind the camera and his steady, wise hand in directing the lighting is second to none.",

As noted in other comments here, cinematography does not get any better than this.One of the many memorable scenes that especially stands out is in the restaurant where Clerici, his old professor and their wives are dining together. Bertolucci holds a simple profile shot of all four, which reveals so much. The action beneath the table is utterly at odds with what is going on above the table!And, hallelujah!!! - bagloon's suggestion here that Il Conformista may never make it to DVD seems to be wrong - check the recent posts to the IMDb discussion board!",

Aesthetically perfect thanks to the combination of an immense director (Bernardo Bertolucci) and an equally immense cinematographer (The master Vittorio Storaro). In front of the camera we have actors of the caliber of Stefania sandrelli and Jean Louis Trintignant. The only flaw may be the absence of the plot. Let me explain, the movie is almost flawless if it were not for the somewhat insopid story and the slightly obvious ending. But still the movie must be seen absolutely.",

            "content": "Just purchased the Paramount DVD of Il Conformista and aside from the surprise of a very reasonable price ($12.99 CAD) the transfer is excellent with none of the subtle colours lost nor any of the excellence in the sound track. This is my all time favourite film having seen it in the theatre at its first release in 1970 and then sporadically over the years until it was just not being projected anywhere due to a lack of decent prints, I imagine. The DVD version was worth the wait and instead of gouging the public for this cinematic rarity, Paramount has done the right thing and released a quality product for a very, very reasonable price. If you are a Bertolucci fan then this is the film you will want to start your collection. It's a winner on all counts. Only thing that keeps it from being a \"10\" is a slight lag in some of the sound track when the characters are speaking and that may have been in the original print as well.",

Tringtingant portrays the confined movements and confidential mannerisms of the gestapo officer in such a fashion that it is unquestionably spot on.A powerful film, the Conformist is one that has very deep back stories, tying loose ends in the film and giving it another dimension. The watcher is engaged within the secret lives of many throughout this film.This is without doubt an enthralling political drama which is good study material and is quite realistic in multiple ways.",

The movie starts very well and you can say that the first half is on a high and keeps you glued to the screen. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is not particularly impressive.The main character, Marcello, has a traumatic childhood that predetermines his behavior in adulthood. He cannot find himself among others, his image is extremely confused and so are his actions. He fails to realize himself throughout the film.There are scenes where the characters don't react believably enough to fulfill the script and that's a big problem for the narrative.Still, I don't regret watching it, but I won't repeat it.",

            "content": "This film has to score 10 out of 10 from anyone who has seen it. Why? Put simply, this film is not perfect for just one or a few aspects; this movie is perfect in every aspect, every minute detail has been worked out so precisely by everyone on board that this transcends film to become an unmissable experience.The overall experience of the movie is great as you sit down to watch 108 minutes you will get lost in Bertolucci's vision of 1930's France and a fascist Italy and need never check how long it will be until the end of the movie. However, as I said it is everything about this movie that is perfect and the acting is just that with a phenomenal central performance from Jean-Louis Trintignant (it doesn't roll off the tongue) as the would-be fascist who is silently haunted from thoughts of a homosexual experience in his youth.The screenplay by Bertolucci is brilliant as it shows how the fascist elite communicate with each other and others who they view as lower. The film also contains a beautiful score from Georges Delerue as it flows from action sequence to contemplation moments.As serious as this movie sounds, it also contains numerous bizarre, abstract and surreal moments.Humanity would be enriched if everyone seen it just once.Even after all this-as if it wasn't enough-the true hero of this movie Vittorio Storaro, the long-time Bertollucci companion and master cinematographer. This movie is truly a visual experience, with its stunning lighting and never-bettered photography, as he captures every beautiful moment, in particular the assassination scene running through the forest.Humanity would be enriched if everyone seen it just once.
