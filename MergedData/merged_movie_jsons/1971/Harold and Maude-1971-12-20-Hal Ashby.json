            "content": "The self-destructive and needy wealthy teenager Harold (Bud Cort) is obsessed by death and spends his leisure time attending funerals, watching demolishing of buildings, visiting junkyards, simulating suicides trying to get attention of his indifferent, snobbish and egocentric mother and having sessions with his psychologist. When Harold meets the anarchist seventy nine year-old Maude (Ruth Gordon) at a funeral, they become friends and the old lady discloses others perspectives of the cycle of life for him. Meanwhile his mother enlists him in a dating service and tries to force Harold to join the army. On the day of the eightieth anniversary of Maude, Harold proposes her but he finds the truth about the end of the cycle of life.The cult \"Harold and Maude\" was a huge success in Brazil for people of my generation with a refreshing and funny exposition of themes like death, love and life through the friendship and love of a teenager and a septuagenarian woman. The complex Harold is a young man that needs the attention of his indifferent mother. He found in his childhood the only moment that she really seemed to be worried about him after a serious accident in school and he uses to fake suicides trying to have the same attention back. Maude is an anarchist old woman not attached to material stuff like properties or collections that steals cars for self-locomotion. Along a few days, Maude gives a lesson of life to Harold, changing his behavior and feelings forever. The performances of Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort in this weird love story are unforgettable and the soundtrack with Cat Steven's songs is another plus. Unfortunately \"Harold and Maude\" has been forgotten in Brazil by the distributors and neither the VHS nor the DVD has been released in my country; I just have a tape recorded from the cable TV. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Ensina-me a Viver\" (\"Teach me to Live\")",

            "review_title": "Brilliantly executed quirky comedy that could be the most romantic film ever",
            "content": "HAROLD AND MAUDE is one of the quirkiest comedies ever made, both heartwarming and hilarious. Just recently, it made the AFI's Top 100 Funniest Movies of All Time (#45). Not that the list means anything, it didn't include DUMB & DUMBER the funniest damn movie ever made, but I agreed with this choice.Bud Cort is Harold, a morbid teenage boy neglected by his rich mother (Vivian Pickles), who spends her time trying to match him up with blind dates. Harold delights in pretending to kill himself to get attention from his mother and pulls some gruesome tricks out of his sleeve to scare away his blind dates. He goes to funerals as a hobby and while there, he meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a carefree elderly woman. Maude helps to teach Harold the beauty of life and the two slowly fall in love.HAROLD AND MAUDE was ever nominated for any Oscars, but it should have been. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are both brilliant in their roles; unfortunately, this would be the last good film either of them made. Cort was recently reduced to a bit part in THEODORE REX and Gordon died in 1985. But both here are at shining moments in their careers. Vivian Pickles is right on-target as Harold's rich, prissy mother who tries to run Harold's life for him until he breaks free. Maude is certainly one of the most heartwarming characters in cinema history; her philosophies are so very true that I couldn't help but apply them to my life after the movie was over. Some viewers may be disgusted at the thought of a teenage boy and an elderly woman being a hot item, but the idea and execution of it is more an act of respect and love for one another as people than an act of lust and romance, making this in my opinion the most romantic film of all time. HAROLD AND MAUDE is also told very realistically, making the story unfold gracefully and the twist ending is both poignant and reassuring.HAROLD AND MAUDE is certainly one of the funniest movies of all time, but is also one of the most important human stories as well.",

            "review_title": "A Movie That Actually Influenced the Way I Think",
            "content": "Bud Cort appeared in two of my favorite (and two of the quirkiest) movies from the 1970s: \"Harold and Maude\" and \"Brewster McCloud.\" He also appeared in a cameo at the tail-end of \"Sweet Charity,\" another of my favorites. Given that little resume of movie roles, he has forever won a place in my heart, as has this movie.\"Harold and Maude\" is a modest little masterpiece from Hal Ashby, and deserves to be viewed as more than just an eccentric little cult hit appreciated by an elite few. It's hard to think of another movie whose success relies so entirely upon its pitch-perfect tone. Ashby's film walks a tightrope between black (almost too black) comedy and sentimental (almost too sentimental) pathos, but manages to blend the two perfectly to produce something quite unlike anything else I've ever seen.Harold is a gloomy misfit with a morbid death obsession, who likes to stage his own fake suicides in order to win the attention of his dithery and oblivious mother (Vivian Pickles, in an uproarious performance). He meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), an eccentric old lady with a taste for fast driving and an unparalleled lust for life. Maude teaches Harold how to enjoy the world around him instead of letting it slowly pass him by, while Harold gives Maude someone to share her days with. It's an achingly beautiful movie, in a low-key kind of way. Ashby is the king of understatement, and everything, both the outrageous comedy and the tender, sad moments, are delivered simply and effectively. He's got great actors in a great story, and he trusts both enough to stand back and let them work their magic.Ruth Gordon gives one of my favorite film performances of all time as Maude. It would be easy to dismiss her role as easy, if it were not for those quiet moments when Maude lets her enthusiastic guard down and we get glimpses of some sadness in her life that she's made a willful decision not to let overcome her. There are moments in this movie that actually made me think differently about the world we live in. Just for an example, there's a scene when Harold and Maude are sitting by a pond, and Harold gives Maude a ring he won for her in a carnival. She clutches it to her chest, thanks him for it, and then throws it into the water. Harold at first looks outraged that she would throw his gift away. But she says, \"Now I'll always know where it is,\" and Harold's hurt look transforms into a smile of understanding. If I could think about life the way the character of Maude does in this movie, I know I would be a happier person.\"Harold and Maude\" is a shining gem from the 1970s, and one of those movies I just have to watch every once in a while. Along with the two leads, there's of course Pickles' off-the-wall performance, and very funny support from actors in minor roles, like Harold's therapist (\"sagging buttocks\") and his war-crazed uncle. Plus, there's the wonderful score comprised of Cat Stevens songs, which caps off the tone of the movie beautifully.Grade: A+",

            "review_title": "A film that conjured up many emotions",
            "content": "When Cameron Diaz's character in the Farrelly brothers' 1998 comedy There's Something About Mary describes Harold And Maude as the 'greatest love story of our time', she's not far wrong. While it may not be a conventional love story by any means, it is engaging, passionate, and oddly believable. It was a very brave step to take to make a film about a young boy who falls in love with an old woman, and to tell it in such a dreamlike manner. In a society that generally accept older men falling for younger women, to reverse that trend was extremely daring, especially back in 1971.Harold (Bud Cort) is a 20-something who feels isolated and disconnected with his life living with his rich mother who seems to only be concerned with finding her strange son a wife. Obsessed with death, he regularly stages fake suicides in front of his unresponsive and unimpressed mother. He seems doomed to life of morbidity until he meets 80-year old Maude (Ruth Gordon) who seems to share his passion of attending funerals. Maude has a completely different outlook on life, and indulges in her passions for art and culture, and 'making the most of her time on Earth'. The two become equally infatuated with each other, as Maude shows Harold the delights of life, and begins to teach him how to play the banjo. As Harold falls deeply in love with Maude, his mother persists with quest to find Harold a wife, and after one fake suicide too many, she decides to send him into the military.This is the kind of nihilistic and existential that could have only be produced in the 70's, amidst the madness and folly of the Vietnam war. Harold is a child of this generation, and seems to embody the anger, loss and early loss of innocence that the children of this generation felt. Harold is born into a life lacking in meaning and direction, while Maude has lived a life full of purpose, and having been a prisoner in Auschwitz (in a moving blink-or-you'll-miss-it revelation) has endured the hardships and extremities of life. Harold, with his persistent fake suicides, seems to long for this.All this sounds extremely heavy, but the film explores these themes with a feisty sense of humour, and an air of quirkiness found commonly these days in the films of Wes Anderson. The black comedy seems way ahead of its time. In one scene, Harold finds another potential wife at his home chatting to his mother. He greets the young lady with a very mature and pleasant manner, only to excuse himself and walk outside carrying a jug of petrol. As his mother and the young lady exchange pleasantries, Harold can be scene in the background through the window dousing himself in petrol and then seemingly set himself on wife. The young girl screams in horror as Harold's mother sits embarrassed, only for Harold to appear next to her as if nothing happened.The relationship between Harold and Maude would probably be uncomfortable and strange in another director's hands, but with a fantastic script by Colin Higgins and a heartfelt soundtrack by Cat Stevens, the whole things is moving, profound and sweet. The film conjured up so many emotions in me as the credits rolled after the poignant final scene. Harold And Maude is in equal measures touching, intelligent, insightful, beautiful and extremely vicious.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Hal Ashby's \"Harold and Maude\" neatly fits into the category of cult classic, chiefly by virtue of its subject matter. In brief, the film concerns a morbid young man who befriends a free-spirited septuagenarian. Together they make about as unlikely a pair as you'll ever see in a romantic comedy.The stars of the film, Bud Cort & Ruth Gordon, play their parts with relish. Furthermore, the two have excellent chemistry together. Besides the stars, Vivian Pickles, as Harold's overbearing mother, and Charles Tyner, as his uncle Victor, stand out in support.Ashby's direction is well-handled and the film sports some nice visuals. However, the film's best element on the technical side is arguably the soundtrack. The songs of Cat Stevens are heard throughout and they truly capture and enhance the spirit of the film.In the end, \"Harold and Maude\" is certainly a unique little film and one that seems way ahead of its time. It's the sort of quirky movie that would be right at home next to some of today's independent films. Given it's eccentricities, I'm unsurprised that it was a commercial flop at the time of its release but, thankfully, it has gained in stature over time.",

            "content": "I first came to Harold and Maude from a suggestion from an eccentric friend who I thought I would humor by tracking down a 34-year-old movie. What I found, however, was one of the most amazing yet understated movies about the joys of life that I have ever seen. There are many subtle lines that take an extra amount of time and thought with a little self-reflection that can shake the very belief system of the viewer. For example,\"Zoos are full, prisons are overflowing... oh my, how the world still dearly loves a cage.\"and,\"Maude: I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They're so tall and simple. What flower would you like to be? Harold: I don't know. One of these, maybe. Maude: Why do you say that? Harold: Because they're all alike. Maude: Oooh, but they're not. Look. See, some are smaller, some are fatter, some grow to the left, some to the right, some even have lost some petals; all kinds of observable differences. You see, Harold, I feel that much of the world's sorrow comes from people who are this, (pointing to an individual daisy) yet allow themselves be treated as that (pointing to an entire field of seemingly identical daisies)\"Harold and Maude is about a young person who is full of life and obsessed with death, and an elderly person who is nearing death but is obsessed with life. What is revealed with this strange juxtaposition is that we can only learn to live life to its fullest by following the lessons of the dying. The message that I have taken from Harold and Maude is to live like you were dying!",

Whenever I feel down I watch this film and it reminds me that life is so, so much more than the narrow confines that I live in. For those of you who are turned off by the January December romance, that's exactly what the film is doing, forcing you to accept an insane premise, so all you can do is laugh. Cat Stevens's music is timeless, and one of the rare times that the soundtrack perfectly matches the film. I want to think that Harold would be a little nicer to his mother after the end credits roll. In another fifty years this will still be an excellent film.",

There are many little things in this movie, little details and gags, that increase the movie's replayability. The acting is amazing. Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort have wonderful chemistry,which is a tribute to the their acting ability, as well as the tight writing and solid direction. I was sad that this movie did not garner more recognition than it did when it was released. I am also disappointed that Bud Cort has not starred in more things since this movie.  Oh well. This is a good Hal Ashby movie to start with, but if you get a chance you should watch as many as possible.  They are quirky, thoughtful and wonderful. \"Harold and Maude\" is a paean to life and love, even if it's in the weirdest places.",

I really enjoyed watching it, it was fun to watch.Ruth Gordon really had a great and touching performance in the film as Maude, an old woman who loves life and the earth. I also thought Bud Cort was surprisingly charming as well in the film as Harold, a young man who is very much so obsessed with death. I think the clashing of the two works very well and they actually have great chemistry together. Whenever it was their time to shine they both absolutely rocked their scenes. I thought in the end it was actually a touching, yet heartbreaking film. It's a perfect example of opposites attract.Overall, Harold and Maude was a great film. Definitely gave me similar vibes to The Graduate. Nevertheless, the characters, storytelling, camera work, shot composition, cinematography and acting were all great. I recommend checking it out tbh. There are a lot of good messages in the film.Definitely one of my favorites from the New Hollywood era so far.",

Unfortunately, Ruth Gordon went on to recreate this character in lesser films throughout that decade and the character of the eccentric old lady has become rather shopworn.

            "content": "If so irreverent a story were to be told today, how would one react? As was probably the case when the film was released, people would probably find the theme edgy, if not inappropriate.Such is the case with the cult film `Harold and Maude.' It openly explores themes of suicide, love, death and life with a fresh perspective.\nThe interesting part is how this film will likely find you. In most societies, an older man will likely fall for a woman years his junior. However, Harold (Bud Cort)-a shy teenager with an affinity for death-meets his 80-year-old true love Maude (Ruth Gordon), not at a dance or social event, but at funerals. The meeting almost seems reminiscent of Edward Norton's character's support group addiction in `Fight Club.'\nHarold loves the attention he gets from staging fake suicides to frighten his obtuse and superficial haute-culture mother. In a reaction, she enlists him in a computer dating service in a vain matchmaking attempt to fix him up with Beetle-driving yuppies-to-be. The beauty is he frightens off all his prospective mates with cleverly staged fake suicides. At the same time, he meets Maude, a free-spirited senior who teaches him to appreciate life. After spending more time with her, he finds himself in love with her. However, a barrage of authority-i.e. priests, army-loving uncles and a psychiatrist-urge him not to follow through with his relationship.`Harold and Maude' plays on '60s-esque themes of anti-establishment and open minds. Harold's militaristic uncle comes across as comical in his war-mongering vices-right down to his armless right sleeve that salutes when he pulls the string. Harold seems unhappy though he's surrounded by extravagance that rivals anything on MTV's `Cribs.'  Not only that but his mother's lack of sense and indifference to her son mirrors her addiction to affluence. In addition to the swarm of brides-to-be, she tries to pacify him with material possessions-including a spanking-new Jaguar convertible, which he converts into a hearse.Cat Stevens' open-air, acoustic-driven rock 'n' roll provides the soundtrack for the film. It gives the film a decent organic sound indicative of its demeanor.This is a film that chases happiness wherever it can be found with a Woodstock-sense of responsibility. Maude's vices of vehicular larceny and bong smoking match Harold's love of fake hara-kiris and hearses. In a way, this movie comes across as a bit dated in that time has indeed erased the '60s anticipation of The Age of Aquarius and replaced it with `Fight Club' desperation.However what the film lacks in reality, it makes up for in heart. This movie is not meant to be taken seriously; it's only to break down paradigms of societal thought.",

You can mix all of that and quite simply call it Ashby. What a delight! Elizabeth Bergner was suppose to play the part, marvelously written by Colin Higgins. Hal Ashby flew to London for a meeting with her, she didn't quite get it, she said aloud she couldn't work with a director who looked like Jesus Christ. Well sorry for her, but lucky for Ruth Gordon and lucky for us. As I saw the film after Rosemary's Baby I was kind of worried for Bud Cort for a little while. Ruth Gordon made her name as Dolly Levy in Thornton Wilder's \"The Matchmaker\" got an Oscar for Rosemary's Baby, wrote Adam's Rib with husband Garson Kanin. She was a woman for the ages and \"Harold and Maude\" is her present, her own tribute to an extraordinary life. I've shown the film to kids, 10, 12 years old and they fall in love with her. Bud Cort is the perfect foil for her designs. Cat Stevens and a scrumptious performance by Vivian Pickles, the unforgettable Isadora of Ken Russell's film of Duncan's life, wrap up this exquisite Hal Ashby masterpiece.",

            "content": "Harold and Maude is one of those few movies whose very plot-line is enough to make it stand out from the crowd. In the subsequent forty plus years since it came out, movies about intergenerational romances are still conspicuous by their absence. Well, that's not exactly right really because we still have lots of films where elderly men wind up in sexual relationships with women half their age. But those films don't really count because they are essentially only male wishful thinking fantasies, where these relationships are presented as completely natural and common place; as far as I can see though in the real world old guys don't bag off with gorgeous thirty year old women on a regular basis. No, to be more precise, cinematic intergenerational romances remain conspicuous by their absence if the sexes are swapped the other way around.In this film, a young man with a death-fixation called Harold meets Maude, a 79 year old woman with a lust for life. She lives by her rules alone and she teaches Harold how to grasp life by the scruff of the neck. They fall in love. But one of the many wonderful things about this film is that this scenario is actually presented rather believably and the romance itself is never played for laughs and is treated with respect. Bud Cort with his sickly pallor and bizarre eccentricities, such as driving a hearse and attending funerals recreationally, is believable as a lost young man, while Ruth Gordon makes for a genuinely alluring 79 year old. The great chemistry between the leads is what underpins the success of the movie as a whole. Despite all this, it bombed at the box office. Clearly, the basic idea must've seemed too off-putting for general audiences to get behind, even if it's theme of youthful disillusionment and its anti-establishment message was certainly in tune with the times. But over the years it picked up a cult audience, eventually making money by the mid 80's; evidentially once people actually saw the movie, they understood.At its heart though it's a comedy and a genuinely funny one at that. Unlike a lot of comedies from bygone years its humour remains potent. Maybe it was ahead of its time in some ways and a lot of folks weren't prepared for its peculiar black comedy? Whatever the case, there are many funny moments such as Harold staging elaborate faux suicide performances for the benefit of his uncaring mother and his succession of disastrous blind dates. Then there is Maude's criminal behaviour and couldn't-care-less attitude, which leads to a hilarious scene with a hapless traffic cop - played by Tom Skerritt under the name M. Borman \u2013 which ranks as maybe the funniest moment in the whole film. But another reason to cherish this film is that it mixes the madcap humour with understated seriousness, for instance at one point Harold notices a Holocaust concentration camp serial number tattooed on Maude's forearm. It's never referred to again but it doesn't need to be, this moment tells so much about what made Maude who she is.Director Hal Ashby really turned out a true one-off with Harold and Maude. Ashby was one of the leading directors of the New Hollywood era and this may well rank as his best achievement. In some ways it makes for an interesting counterpart to the earlier film The Graduate which also shares a similar relationship dynamic at its core \u2013 although admittedly far less extreme age-wise. Both male characters are rich disillusioned boys whose lives are controlled by their parents' generation. But while the affair in The Graduate is emotionally empty, in Harold and Maude it is the exact opposite. And as great a film as Mike Hodges one is, it doesn't have the same level of originality in its characters that Hal Ashby's one does. Both films too have wonderful folk rock soundtracks and while Simon & Garfunkel edges it, Cat Stevens soundtrack for Harold and Maude is still a beautiful and perfect accompaniment to this great film.",

If the opposites attract each other, there have not been perhaps more different in every possible way screen couple than 20 years old Harold (Bud Cort) and Maude(charming, clever, multi-talented Ruth Gordon, the Oscar winning actress and three times Oscar nominee for writing) who is just about to turn 80. Harold is a rich kid who is obsessed with death and likes to stage very believable and hilarious succession of suicide attempts to impress his unflappable socialite mother who got used to them and not impressed anymore. Harold's others hobbies are driving the hearse and to attend funerals where he meets one day a woman who will change his life forever, 79 years young free-spirit, rebel, and fighter for \"Liberty. Rights. Justice\", Maude. She also likes to attend the funerals of the strangers. We won't learn much about Maude's life story but there will be one visual flash which gives us a very good idea that Maude knew a lot about death, losses, and suffering but she chose to celebrate, worship, and enjoy life to the fullest. This short poignant moment is a stroke of genius, and there are many of them in the truly unique, one of its kind movie. Maybe Hal Ashby had brought some of memories from his own childhood that included the divorce of his parents, his father's suicide, his dropping out of high school, getting married and divorced all before he was 19, into \"Harold and Maude\". Hal Ashby had made a series of memorable, intelligent, well acted films in the 70s, that included The Last Detail (1973), Shampoo (1975), Bound for Glory (1976), Coming Home (1978) and Being There (1979) but it is \"Harold and Maude\" that has become the cult classic from the first days of its release and it more than deserves its status. The movie also benefits tremendously from the soundtrack of songs by Cat Stevens.",

            "content": "This movie is sooo 1971 - and that is not a bad thing. It was directed by a member of \"the greatest generation\" (Hal Ashby) about a member of his parents' generation (Maude) helping a member of the baby boomers' generation (Harold) choose to seize life rather than go on embracing a kind of living death. The details of the film have been rehashed by several hundred previous reviewers, so I won't do that once again. I will point out that it is interesting that the intended audience for this film - the baby boomers of 1971 who were then in their teens and twenties who so embraced this film then and still do through all of the websites dedicated to its nostalgia - have become what they claimed to abhor in this movie over the last 35 years. They have, in fact, become the most prudish bunch of old people since the Puritans landed at Plymouth Rock. Their collective slogan has changed from \"Let It All Hang Out\" to \"Let All Who Do Not Conform Be Hanged!\". Thanks to the collective legislative efforts of the baby boomers - shortly to begin their second stint in diapers - we do not dare let a 20 year old (Harold's age in the movie) drink one beer even in the bedroom of his own house. We do not dare let bar owners allow smoking in their establishments by anyone no matter what their age, and worst of all the land is dotted with zero-tolerance policies in which a child who shows up to school with an unauthorized aspirin is often treated the same as a child who shows up to school with crack cocaine or a gun as far as expulsion goes.The point of my rant is this - If the Maude of the film were somehow brought back to life today, more than likely she would find Harold acting more like his mother than even his mother did and would likely want to take that handful of pills that ended her life a second time - for completely different reasons.This really is a great film, and I would really hope that when I am 79 I am a cross between the Maude of this movie and Einstein and his compadres in the film \"IQ\". More than that though, I watch this film to remind me how it is a daily battle to stay young at heart and open to the simple pleasures of life. A battle that so many of my older fellow baby boomers have long since lost.",

Maude wrenches Harold free from his morbid and lonely existence to show him how lush and amazing the world can be and he emerges from his experiences a happy man. This is definitely one of the films that (along with say, Fight Club, American Beauty and The Rocky Horror Picture Show) show you can be who you want to be, and you needn't let anyone oppress you.

            "content": "Harold and Maude (1971)Director Hal Ashby hits a sweet spot here between low budget cult funky and slick top tier narrative feature. And the themes, like those in so many movies of this period, are idealistic and anti-Establishment. It's about two people who truly truly do what is best for them, no matter what people may think. And their hearts are so pure, they express no doubts.Not that the movie is simple minded. The last fifteen minutes is not only gut wrenching and startling, it's also beautiful and necessary, as if the viewer wakes from the dream, too, and sees what was maybe impossible all along.Ashby pulled off a few well-received movies in his short career, including Being There (1979), and yet it is Harold and Maude that comes off as the most connected to its audience, and to the times, becoming a cult favorite. But as with all cult movies, the very quirkiness that makes them special repulses others. Even the Cat Stevens soundtrack, with many famous and not-so-famous songs throughout, will thrill some and make other run. It's a crude movie in some ways, including the way the songs get truncated so often, but it's brilliant in too many other ways to care. Watch for searing, perfect performances by Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort as the titled characters, and also by Vivian Pickles as the mother. Cinematographer John Alonzo is a mainstay in the industry and helps hold together the entire feel of the movie. And really the story itself, by Colin Higgins, is a spot on fairy tale.",

            "review_title": "Possibly the most unusual, and best, comedy ever made",
            "content": "Here is possibly the most unusual, and in my opinion, the best comedy ever made. \"Harold & Maude\" begins with a heavy dose of black humor, with the death-obsessed Harold performing 'suicides' as a way of rebelling against his domineering mother. His vehicle of choice is a hearse, and when he's not explaining his pitch-black fantasies to his shrink, he's crashing funerals. The film takes an unexpected turn with the introduction of Maude, a vivacious octogenarian who shares Harold's penchant for attending the funerals of strangers, but instead of being obsessed with death, she is obsessed with life. Her unique outlook and interesting activities, which include grand theft auto, endear her to Harold, and the two kindred spirits form a close relationship, which eventually blossoms into romance.This may seem quite unbelievable (and frankly, disgusting) for a twenty-something to fall for an eighty-year-old, but through Ashby's beautiful, skilled direction and Bud Cort's and Ruth Gordon's wonderful performances, the love story is entirely convincing and quite beautifully handled.The humor, is as I said, to begin with, very black, but there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, particularly with Harold's methods of scaring of dates picked for him by his mother, and the reaction of Harold's family and friends to the news of his infatuation with Maude. Cat Stevens' beautiful soundtrack makes this film even more beautiful. While this may be not for everyone, those who can appreciate it will enjoy it immensely.",

            "content": "Rich, but gloomy, disaffected and neurotic Harold (a lovely and charming portrayal by Bud Cort) has a morbid fixation on death; he regularly attends funerals of complete strangers and stages elaborate phony suicides in an attempt to get noticed by his cold and overbearing mother (superbly played to snooty perfection by Vivian Pickles). Harold gets shaken out of his grim funk after he meets and befriends Maude (a marvelously spry and rascally performance by Ruth Gordon), an exuberant elderly free spirit who gets Harold to loosen up and start enjoying life. Director Hal Ashby, working from a fresh, quirky and witty script by Colin Higgins, does a terrific job of creating and sustaining a delightfully droll and deadpan tone that gives the giddy black humor an irresistible blend of joy and verve that's a total treat to watch (Harold's fake suicides in particular are positively sidesplitting). Moreover, the sweet and touching central love story between two endearing oddball misfits is handled with great taste and sensitivity. Better still, this movie makes a profound statement about how one person can have a significant positive impact on another human being and how we should all love and appreciate life while we can. Among the comic highlights are Maude's wildly careening driving of stolen vehicles, Harold's inappropriate computer dates (Ellen Geer as pretentious aspiring actress Sunshine Dore is a complete hoot as she beats Harold at his own game), and Maude stealing a motorcycle from a highway patrolman (Tom Skerritt in a nifty minor role). In addition, we even get some real pathos amongst all the madcap hilarity; it's implied that Maude was a concentration camp survivor and Harold's big break-up scene is truly moving. It's this delicate blend of humor and poignancy which makes this film so special and unique. Cort and Gordon are both outstanding in the leads; they receive sterling support from Pickles, Charles Tyner as Harold's gung-ho military fanatic Uncle Victor, and Eric Christmas as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens provides a sublimely cheerful and uplifting score. John A. Alonzo's bright cinematography gives the picture a pleasing sunny look. Essential viewing.",

The script is superlative, counterbalancing all the incidents of gore; the film almost comes across as a pre-emptive \"Breakfast Club\" for the \"Fight Club\" generation. Desperation and listlessness weighs Harold down, until Maude lightens his existence by showing him how to live for once. Her bubbly persona is the yang to his yin, and the film's quirky comedy cheers the audience as well as Harold with its subtlety.

The story is charming and heart-warming, Hal Ashby directs wonderfully, the pace is just right and Harold and Maude themselves are characters that still are in my head and also found myself empathising and identifying with them.

I knew a lot of people who raved about this film and I do like original quirky films but when I saw it I couldn't embrace it as others did. It's an interesting story of an 80 year old widow who gets her kicks out of looking at the obituaries and selecting funerals to attend as if she were looking for movies to see in the entertainment section of the newspaper. At one of the funerals she meets a 20 year old man who is a loser and they began a unlikely alliance. Ruth Gordon is charming and funny in her role of the elder woman. A revered stage actress she made few films and fewer still where she had a lead role. Bud Cort as a promising young actor had a few films in the 70's beginning with a small role in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H and with Altman again in the starring role in Brewster Mccloud. His career quirky tapered off to supporting cast film roles in mostly forgettable movies and some supporting television roles. Gordon is funny in this film but he is not and his character becomes irritating after a while. This was only the second film from promising director director Hal Ashby. He would fire off a series of good films after Harold And Maude including The Last Detail, Shampoo, Coming Home, Bound for Glory and Being There. Ashby then went through the 1980's making only four forgettable feature films and one documentary and destroyed his health through drug abuse and never re lit the spark he had in the 70's before his untimely death. Screenwriter Collin Higgins turned in a good story here as his career was just beginning. He would go on to write some a handful of good comedies including Silver Streak, Nine to five, Foul Play and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas before his untimely death. I've seen this a couple times since when I first saw it in about 1974 mainly for the Cat Stevens soundtrack and Ruth Gordon's performance. I would give this a 7.0 out of 10.",

Other than this film simply being so damn good, I have personal reasons to love HAROLD & MAUDE:  * I saw them filming this in Pacifica, CA in 1970 (the one-second-long shot of Harold driving off the highway toward the cliff at the end of the film).  * I grew up all around the filming locations (San Francisco Bay Area).   * And more... ...But enough about me.  Here are bits of trivia that may be of interest to some:  * Years ago I read that the H&M script was writer Colin Higgins' senior thesis project for scriptwriting at USC or UCLA (I forget which).  * Higgins adapted the script into a stage play in appx 1980, in which Ellen Geer (the movie's \"Sunshine Dore\") played Maude recently.  * I read a paperback novelization of H&M years ago, and it was written that Harold used the top of a Datsun (Nissan) station-wagon to modify the Jaguar into a hearse.  There was a period of about five years where I would HAVE to see this film every 6 months or so to \"re-charge\" my enthusiasm for life.  I just watched it again last week, and it had a lovely tranquilizing effect on me (calmed my stresses about finance and romance; made me appreciate the beauty of life again).  Not many movies have the power to do that.  I consider this movie my favorite, second only to \"Nights of Cabiria\" by Fellini (see!), and I give HAROLD AND MAUDE a 95% rating (of course, 100% being perfect).",

Not the kind of older woman found in \"The Graduate\", but a nearly eighty year old free wheeling free spirit named Maude, convincingly portrayed by Ruth Gordon. Together they form a symbiotic relationship that proves both charming and unnerving, as Harold searches for the meaning of life, and Maude does nothing more than show him how to live it.Once you get past Harold's first two suicides, the rhythm of the movie switches gears slightly, focusing now and then on Mrs. Chasen's (Vivian Pickles) attempt to hook up her son with prospective wives utilizing a computer dating service that screens out the fat and ugly. With composure equal to the task, Harold convincingly asserts his preference to remaining single with almost comic results if his tactics weren't so gruesome. You have to pay attention to Mom's answers for the dating questionnaire, it's about the funniest deadpan you'll ever hear.All the while the picture utilizes an effective Cat Stevens soundtrack, the songs appropriately selected for the scenes they play against. They would have worked better for me had Stevens never endorsed the Ayatollah Khomeini's call for the death of novelist Salman Rushdie, but that's another story. Stevens' music strikes just the right melancholy, interspersed among assorted funerals, manic car cruises and a display of inspired lunacy between the title characters to thwart a military induction for Harold.In the end, \"Harold and Maude\" is a life affirming film that takes a road less traveled to convey it's lessons. Not entirely believable of course, but then the film would have lost some of it's quirky power and resonance. Also not for every taste, but for anyone eager to 'greet the dawn with a breath of fire', the film has enough going for it to recommend at least a single viewing.",

For me they will always be glorious birds.\"This has got to be on the short list for best romantic comedies of all-time. It's highly unconventional, with an affluent but disaffected young man (Harold, played by Bud Cort) finding a genuine connection with a vivacious old woman (Maude, played by Ruth Gordon). He has a habit of pretending to kill himself to show his mother his dark state of mind presumably over how phony their lives are, and one of his hobbies is attending funerals of people he never knew. She is a free spirit living each day to the fullest, and relating to people and the world around her in an authentic way.It's a film filled with dark humor, romance, philosophy, and commentary on militarism and religion (that priest obsessed over the images of their bodies!), all done intelligently, with restraint. Director Hal Ashby did a brilliant job finding a balance in this film's tone. There are bits that are deeply cynical, such as the uncle who tries to get him to enlist in the military with a framed photo of Richard Nixon behind him, and bits that are sweet and optimistic, such as how Maude has retained her buoyancy over the years, and gotten wiser instead of becoming beaten down by the world.There were several scenes that gave me goosebumps, including a backward zoom in the cemetery, revealing row after row of tombstones, after Maude has dispensed a pearl of wisdom about remembering one's individuality in life. The setting is a graveyard, and yet she's talking about life, and how to be happy in it despite the fact that we're all going to die. Another one is the scene in a pile of junk near the freeway at sunset, where with the briefest of glances at her wrist tattoo, we find that Maude was a Holocaust survivor (the only reference in the entire film). The setting appears ugly at first glance, but then cinematographer John Alonzo gives us that magnificent shot of the sunset, and Maude says the lines at the top of this review, finding the beauty and majesty in what's around her.The soundtrack from Cat Stevens is a real highlight in this film (he was in such a groove in this period), and seeing 75-year-old Ruth Gordon singing \"If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\" and dancing around was wonderful. She's simply perfect for this role, and how I'd love to be like her character when I'm old, minus the grand theft auto and reckless driving.",

It's a film that pokes fun at American culture, with its emphasis on traditional family, the military, the police, standards of decorum, and other institutions and traditions. Neither Harold nor Maude really fits in to such a staid society, so they participate in their own ways, however unusual or problematic.I'll watch almost any film that Ruth Gordon is in. She's so spunky and fun, with a distinctive voice and a unique personality. She's the perfect Maude, with a zest for life (at 79 years old), wanting to experience everything that life has to offer, even if it's not quite lawful. In one scene, she mentions to Harold, almost as an afterthought: \"At one time I used to break into pet shops to liberate the canaries\". No big deal, apparently; after all, birds want to be free just like humans.But Harold, as portrayed by long-legged, round-eyed Bud Cort, is something of a dud. His nondescript manner pales in comparison to vivacious Maude; maybe that's the point. The hearse is something of a prop, but I like the way Maude (supposedly) drives it. The script is uneven. Some scenes play out like a \"Hogan's Heroes\" situation comedy.That some people don't like this film speaks to their dislike of nonconformity, I suspect. The film, with its counter-culture theme, was made during an era when eccentricity was celebrated, not shunned like it is now. Which shows how America has changed in the intervening forty years. The Cat Stevens music, too, really makes the film dated. Cinematography and editing are fine.Something of a dark comedy, \"Harold And Maude\" is a product of its era, with its celebration of nonconformity, however morbid or bizarre. The film's value lies as much in its historical themes as in the plot or production.",

As such, it became a cult favorite with the hippie generation, but it is a chore to sit through it now. Harold and Maude are two of the most self-absorbed characters in the history of cinema. They are meant to be endearing but are extremely annoying, particularly Maude, as she is played by Gordon, an actress with annoying mannerisms. The humor is forced and unfunny and the emotions are phony. The scenes featuring Pickles, as Harold's mother, provide very mild amusement. Everything else is lame.",

            "content": "I saw this movie many years ago and didn't particularly like it. However, I just saw it again after more than 20 years and found I loved the film--maybe I was just too serious when I first saw the film! This is a very black comedy about a depressed and death-loving young man (Bud Cort) and a very strange old lady who befriends him (Ruth Gordon)--and boy does Cort need a friend! He is a rich young man who has a domineering and inept mother who barely notices him. As a result, Cort spends most of the first half of the movie faking suicides (some of them very bloody) to get her attention. In addition, he's a necrophile (not the sexual type--ewwww!)--buying an old hearse and attending strangers' funerals for fun. At one of these funerals, he's approached by weird and wacky Gordon who takes a liking to him. She is almost completely crazy but also has a real joy for living and slowly Cort begins to loosen up and he falls in love with her--even though she is about 60 years his senior (ewwww)! There's more to the plot than this and some hilarious moments (such as the talk with his uncle about joining the army), but I'd rather not spoil the film.There are some very dark but very funny moments throughout, however the film also has a serious message that is, beneath all the death, quite life-affirming. Plus, it encouraged weird people (like myself) to continue not taking life so seriously and just enjoy. However, I am sure this movie isn't for everyone's taste. If you have an odd sense of humor and don't mind an off-kilter film, then give it a try. There's very little not to like--unless you dislike the music of Cat Stevens, which seems to permeate and dominate this film.SPOILER ALERT--DON'T READ THE FOLLOWING: By the way, while many may NOT like the way the way the film ends, there are some reasons why I think it wasn't a bad ending. I felt as if in order for Harold to go on with life and grow into a \"normal\" person, Maude felt she had to leave him and that was why she did what she did. Just a thought.",

            "content": "I'm not sure how well I can articulate the ways in which this movie disappoints me. I'll throw out some random thoughts, and see if they lead me in the direction of a coherent opinion.There's a difference between a \"free spirit\" and a \"loose cannon\"; Maude definitely struck me as the latter. I imagine an alternate ending wherein the doctors save Maude's life after she takes the tablets, but while at the hospital she's arrested for multiple auto theft. Faced with spending years in prison (although she's 80, she's in good health), she suffers a complete loss of composure and/or a breakdown, and Harold sees how Maude's \"independence\" is actually a reckless disregard for the rights of others.Everyone in the movie is a caricature rather than a character, but since that's so blatantly obvious I can't fault the movie for it. I figure it must be deliberate. Still, the scene where Harold breaks down in his shrink's office makes me suspect that there IS supposed to be some depth to Harold, but the writer didn't develop it. Harold IS more than merely \"eccentric\", he's truly disturbed, and it would take more than his adventures with Maude to bring him any sort of peace. If, as I assume we are expected to, we end up seeing his analyst/therapist/whatever as a buffoon on an equal footing with the mother, the uncle, and the priest, I can only say that THIS doctor may be a fool, but Harold STILL needs professional help.Perhaps, after Harold drives his car off the cliff, he goes back home and calls Sunshine. She may be a flaky actress wannabe, but she was the one who SAW THROUGH Harold's staged suicide, and was willing to play along. From her OWN death-scene it appears that Sunshine is a very BAD actress, though, so perhaps that's why Harold shunned her.All this being said, I personally wasn't troubled by the \"ick\" factor of Harold and Maude consummating their love. I wouldn't PERSONALLY have found Maude sexually appealing when I was his age, but I credit Harold with recognizing that true love and passion have very little to do with the beauty of our bodies and much to do with the beauty of our minds.",

            "content": "This 1971 black comedy is still a stitch, even if it doesn't feel as audacious as I'm sure it once did. Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at the same funerals. However, the root of their respective interests couldn't be more different - Maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all.The plot is really about their burgeoning relationship, while his mother constantly attempts to make the death-obsessed Harold more socially acceptable. First, she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates. To foil any hope of romance with these women, however, he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother. She then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother Victor, a hawkish officer and Vietnam War amputee, to try to convince Harold to join the Army. The episodic structure of the story by Collin Higgins (years before becoming a director in his own right with \"Foul Play\" and \"Nine to Five\") allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters' actions. The movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements, surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone.Ruth Gordon is her typically pixilated self, an archetype she played for years afterward, while Bud Cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide-eyed cynicism. It's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later. There are funny sideline performances by Vivian Pickles as Harold's eye-rolling mother, Ellen Geer as an overly actressy blind date named Sunshine, and Eric Christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens' soundtrack hasn't aged as well as, say, Simon and Garfunkel's music in \"The Graduate\", but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings. Unfortunately, the 2000 DVD contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included.",

She loves life and she brings Harold out of his shell. They quickly fall in love.A deserved cult film. This (understandably) bombed as a mainstream movie (it was considered too dark) but was a big hit when it started playing the midnight movie circuit in the 1970s.This is VERY 70s in terms of style, music (Cat Stevens) and its general laid-back attitude but it still works wonderfully. I never found Cort that good (he's TOO blank-faced) but Gordon brings the movie to life. She sparks every scene she's in--she seems to be having a whale of a time in her role. She's helped by a wonderful script that has some of the best observations on life that I've ever heard. My favorite is, \"Everybody's allowed to make an a** out of themselves once in their life\".The movie is very quiet and laid-back and the black humor (which is actually pretty mild) may turn off some viewers.

I knew nothing of what the 1971 film was about but had heard so much about it and was aware of its legacy as somewhat of a cult classic, so I took the chance to include it on my watchlist. I really enjoy going into a film blind, but it simply doesn't get to happen that often. Hal Ashby's film about the attraction of opposites caught me by surprise, and I am grateful for it.Harold (Bud Cort) is a 20-year-old who seems to be afraid of the future, so afraid in fact that he spends a majority of his time thinking of and staging his own death. In his spare time, when he's not \"committing suicide\" in front of his mother, Harold attends funerals. At one of the funerals he attends, Harold meets Maude (Ruth Gordon) a 79-year-old woman with a thirst for life. Harold is stunned upon meeting his polar opposite that one can enjoy and find such fulfillment in a temporary state that appears so pointless. Maude is able to expose Harold to the world that has previously been closed to him by his mother who is too busy planning Harry's life to take interest in what he wants to do. The more time Harold and Maude spend together, the more complicated their relationship becomes. Harold has fallen in love with Maude and wishes to be with her over the women his mother attempt to set him up with. Maude, however, has been keeping a secret from Harold, that has devastating consequences for the both of them.Granted, I had no expectations for this film, however, if I had expectations they could have only been exceeded. Harold and Maude is a brilliant coming-of-age tale and I am so glad to have had the opportunity to see it. In a Woody Allen-esque film, Harold and Maude deals with death and the pointlessness of life in a beautiful way. There is no happy ending to life. Every good thing we experience is temporary, as we all eventually die. The narrative of Harold and Maude doesn't ignore this fact and the audience is the better for it. In an ending reminiscent of a personal favorite, Jules and Jim, Harold and Maude is a breathtaking portrait of two different individuals and their perception on the temporary state that life is.",

After meeting Maude at funerals where he goes for fun, his life is opened up by this free spirited older women who shows him love in its true form (not in any cheesy way at all) and a well-lived life.It's so classic and quite funny - thoroughly enjoyable.\"A lot of people enjoy being dead.

But change of plans, it was convenient to show this to everyone at home and couldn't find a better time. After finishing the film, there a silence and a little smile in the faces, that can sum the bittersweet the journey of Harold and Maude. At first, there was a bit of negative whimpers due to the staged suicides and topics of death. I thought of switching it and play John's Ford How Green Was My Valley (1947). Well, i'm glad the switch didn't happen as everyone loved the film.Ruth Gordon is wonderful as the septuagenarian Maude brimming with optimism and checks all the boxes to find the balance between the childish attitude, the age defect and the emotional depth of the character. Bud Cort who does a fantastic job as Harold, a young boy who is the opposite of Maude's character, he often fakes his own suicide. He is like the DSBM (Depressive Suicidal Black metal) poser minus the whole self mutilation and theatrics set in the 70s. Both Harold and Maude share an unusual hobby and an unlikely companionship blossoms. Maude strives to celebrate the happiness of a simple life and wins over the pessimistic side of Harold with her kindness and maturity. The dialogues are fantastic and doesn't feel it's artificially written like a sermon on life. It has subtle humour, there is emotion, but not overdramatic and avoids clich\u00e9s. Also, like they say the best journeys start with amazing soundtrack. It is so true as Cat Stevens gives his heart and soul for the film, it boasts of a well done score, maybe one of the best soundtracks ever.In short, there's so much in this film with elements of black comedy, existentialist drama and a kaleidoscope of human emotions. Like many others i don't want to compare it with the films of Louis Malle, John Cassavetes, Eric Rohmer, Woody Allen or Robert Benton. Director Hal Ashby adds his own style and charm and this film will forever be considered one of the greatest contribution to the medium. A Timeless masterpiece.",

            "review_title": "a romantic black comedy of the most light-hearted/sinister psychological ideals",
            "content": "I wouldn't say I really clicked into Harold and Maude entirely on a first viewing- maybe I may never will. It almost has something to it at times that I found a bit unique for that un-trustworthy brand of cinema known as the romantic comedy. It's not the last time it's happened, but what I found fascinating about the psychological interest the character of Harold (Bud Cort, dead-pan to the point of inertia sometimes), is that we see really what is going on inside Harold's head in the midst of the actual scene as it's playing out, subjectivity in the guise of objective, cold shooting. The best example(s) can be found when he tries to commit suicide- more than once as it were. It's actually kind of manipulative, and if you've ever known someone or even been a survivor of suicide it might be very off-putting to see it put on such bizarre display here. But it adds to the perverse fun of the picture to see that hopelessness is really the only thing from keeping these fantasies going on as Harold's head-strong, perpetually bourgeois mother (Vivian Pickles, a perfectly one-track performance), keeps trying to set him up with women...or else it's off to the army. It's a creative cinematic trick, though it might have even worked itself greater in a short film, or even as an actual novel where Harold (and Maude for that matter) could be revealed even more with their psychological insides and emotional bearings and depths.So in a sense Harold and Maude only sometimes gets under the surface. But said surface ends up making for the kind of unusual movie that doesn't give 'unusual' a bad name at all. It was the second feature directed by Hal Ashby, and his acute sense of the visual with the purity of either eccentric/bottled-up people, or just stiff rich folks, is uncanny. His strengths at keeping Colin Higgins rocky, predictably unpredictable screenplay in check is also a plus. Yet Harold and Maude, for all of its successes at making some uproarious comedic moments as Harold keeps himself systematically detached not just from his mother, psychiatrist, and crazy army-lifer uncle, but from the proposed ladies as well (there is one, the last one, who is an actress who actually 'gets' what Harold is doing with a Kari-Kiri ritual, is maybe the funniest of all), doesn't do as much as I thought it might in really getting underneath this young man and old woman. There's an interesting split of the two sides of life- despair and joy- that make up the sort of existential mishaps both characters get into, and likely draw one another to each other as mutual funeral crashers. If only it wasn't so quirky all the time- sometimes too much whimsy can backfire.Still, the bit of unease I felt from the film's mis-fires in its broad strokes at black comedy (my least favorite being the one with Harold, the uncle, and Maude as a \"protester\" on the rocky cliffs), there was enough that was attained by the actors to make it worthwhile and at least worth one viewing. In fact, I'd say I would watch this again just for Ruth Gordon, who we learn just from one quick shot (a tattoo on her arm, don't miss it) about why perhaps she is who she is at this age, and it's maybe too quick yet crucial to understanding who she is. She is, on the surface, a kind of overly bright, near-crazy fire-fly burning on into that crossroads of 79 into 80. She also is a wonderful contrast to Cort, who along with his dead-pan qualities down pat, can also have fun too in doing his weird little suicidal moments (I loved the bit in the bathtub), or when he has to get more emotional revealing his first brush with death. In the end, I'm reminded of a line from Scorsese's the Departed: 'death is easy- life is much harder'. We may never know if Harold becomes joyful, especially with such a sad ending that ends up coming, but there is a slight skip to his step as he plays the banjo, which is a kind of catharsis from seeing this glimpse into the lives of these two 'made-for-each-other' characters.Harold and Maude, with its sweet and puffy folk songs by Cat Stevens, and fine cinematography and editing, is a very good effort at stretching what is expected out of the dreaded 'rom-com', by giving something completely different and still sticking to a template of love conquering all...in a manner of speaking. Not Ashby's best, but far from his worst either. 7.5/10",

The expression, coined by this movie, refers to a friendship or love-affair between a very young man and a much older woman. The two main characters are not only very different in age, but also in their personalities. Young Harold, eccentric, spoiled, suicidal, is almost the exact opposite of old Maude (brilliantly played by the ever-feisty Ruth Gordon), who is vibrant and full of life's spirit.Following the pair on their \"outings\" is both hilarious and provocative. To see the fearless Maude playfully \"deal with\" irritating police officers, or responding to a suspicious priest whose car she had recently \"borrowed\", or to pose nude for an elderly ice sculptor, to ensure he retains the memory of the female body, or to simply rejoice in the beauties of nature, is an inspiration to viewers at any stage of life.Harold's countless fake suicides are hilarious, but he eventually meets his match in a young prospective \"date\" sent by a matrimony agency. The young woman was a devout fan of \"Shakespearean\" Theatre, responding to Harold's \"Harikari\" suicide by doing one of her own favorite death-scenes from Romeo & Juliet. - The character playing Harold's idle-rich, not much less eccentric mother, had a brilliant line here: \"Harold, that was your last date!\" Assosiating with this \"odd friend\" teaches Harold many lessons about life. For the first time he realizes that his life had only just begun, while Maude is nearing the end of her days. The ending is heartbreaking.\"Harold & Maude\" has been an instant classic immediately after its release in 1971. Since then it has gained cult status.

            "content": "Harold and Maude is an unlikely love story that takes readers on an unexpected adventure as the lives of two unique yet perfectly matched people intertwine. In this story the underdog, Harold, comes out a changed and better man in the end of the movie. This story line appeals to many viewers whether or not they can directly relate to his situation.The movie was filmed in the San Francisco Bay area and released in America in 1971. The film was directed by Hal Ashby and written Colin Higgins, with featured music by Cat Stevens throughout. Although the film was a box office disappointment, it has since reached new heights, being praised by film critics and avid-viewers alike as a funny, believable, charming movie.Harold's character, played by Bud Cort, is a young man coming from a rich family who goes against his mother's every will in a desperate attempt to gain her attention and affection. He continually stages his own deaths and suicides, some more ridiculous than others, until she reaches her wits end and orders him to marry in an attempt to fix his attitude for good. Unlike most young men his age, Harold enjoys visiting funerals, graveyards, and demolition sites. Although he doesn't find a bride his mother would approve of at any of his hangouts, he does find a new and wonderful friend.Maude's character is the pivotal person in Harold's life. Like him, she enjoys the morbid, but for different reasons. Through her eccentricities and unconditional love for living things, she shows Harold that life can be good if it's truly enjoyed and appreciated to the fullest each day. \"A lot of people enjoy being dead, but they're not dead. They're just backing away from life.\" Maude is considerably older than Harold, and seems to take him under her wing through the movie, helping him find things in life that make him happy besides being dead.The culmination of this happy-go-lucky movie is Harold and Maude falling in love, or Harold falling in love with her. He shows her the things that he has learned in a birthday party he throws for her 80th birthday. All is going well until Harold discovers she has poisoned herself in order to die because she doesn't believe she wants to live beyond 80. Harold is distraught and takes her to the hospital, but not before it's too late. The audience can sympathize with his sadness and grief at the loss of what we believe is his only true friend in life, and his lover.The life lessons Maude taught Harold are obvious at the end of the movie, when the shot angles and scenes lead us to believe he will drive himself off a cliff in one last suicide, but walks away from the cliff with a banjo in his arms, plucking out \"If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\" by Cat Stevens. He is going to go on and live life to the fullest, so he can truly live before he dies.The film is full of interesting shots and scenes. There are some strange angles and locations that keep the viewer intrigued and following the story. A great scene that allows the viewer to think that they are really watching the couple as they evolve as people is the scene where they are dancing in Maude's house. The camera pans out through the window and tracks them at their eye level as they dance down her streetcar home to a Cat Stevens song. This is just one example of the brilliant filming abilities and directing used in the film.The film also uses the music of Cat Stevens to illustrate scenes in a new light. The scene where Harold and Maude are in the military graveyard is one example of this. As the camera view pans out and up to show more and more of the massive graveyard, the song \"Where do the Children Play\" cries out above the dark scene. This seems to be a reference not only to wars in general but possibly the Vietnam War specifically. The scene is just one political statement made in the movie, but one that stood out strongly to me.The movie starts out very strange, and very slow. The viewer isn't given much information to go on or use to enjoy the film fully until Maude appears and shakes up the structure of Harold's life. The ending of the movie is the culmination of a warm and exciting journey that the audience has followed Harold make and felt as though they were apart of, and the way he handles Maude's death is a closing scene that is sure to stick on minds and hearts of all kinds of viewers.",

            "content": "\"L-I-V-E! Live! Otherwise, you've got nothing to talk about it in the locker room\".This invitation to cherish and live life to the fullest obviously addresses a young man but there are other places than a locker room to brag about your achievements. Indeed, any human being facing for some reason an existential crisis should listen to Dame Marjorie Chardin aka \"Maude\", played by the always delightful Ruth Gordon.Why are some of us so hesitant to confront whatever the day above the ground has to offer? This is not exactly the central question of Hal Ashby's \"Harold and Maude\", the film is less interested in the disease than the remedy and a few side-effects. The suicidal tendencies of life-sick Harold Chasen (Bud Cort) are handled in a comedic way that confines to absurdity, each staged suicide looks pretty horrific but the deadpan reaction of Harold's snooty and affectionless mother (Vivian Pickles) asks the question: which one's attitude has caused the other?All jokes put aside, Harold is caught in an existential never-ending circle where his mind contemplates death like a ticking bomb, one attempt might not be for fun. To satisfy his morbid curiosity or simmer down his lust for life-termination, Harold attends funerals and seems to get some temporary relief. In one of them, he meets Maude (Ruth Gordon) a pint-sized 79-year-old lady with a face never deserted by a smile and a body never deserted by a happy though. A strange bond emerges from their encounter, Maude seems like she feels a gap. Is it her insouciance? Her eccentric habits and antics? The way she steals car and motorcycles as as if she was simply borrowing them? The way she cares about any living creatures to the point that she visualizes the suffering of a tree and gives personalities to flower? Is it her smile that is more defiant than any anti-establishment rally? Or maybe is it because, like Harold, she's got an 'attitude' and that she acts according to it ... that happens to be positive in the way that it achieves every single goal she dares to challenge. At some point, I wasn't even questioning what would Harold find in Maude because I could figure it out myself, strangely drawn to her life-embracing persona. And Harold couldn't have a better antidote to his mental suffocation, everything from his family is about having the control, molding the individual through the army or psychoanalysis, even rigging the dating game through pre-computer selected rendezvous. It's a puppet circus and a freak show hidden under a tent of respectable hypocrisy magnificently embodied by the mother. Harold is only 18, he isn't influent enough to fight but he's smart enough to see right through it, just not desperate enough to end his life for real.When asked which flower he'd like to be, he points to a daisy, one among many others, because they all look alike, Maude contradicts his point, they're all different, bigger, smaller, with or without petals ... she sees in these daisies the tragedy of life: each one wants to be unique but we all end up the same and in one of the most beautiful ellipses of the New Hollywood era, we see them walking across the Golden Gate National cemetery and the shot is worth a thousand words. The place is full of persons who were all unique in life, only be reunited in death and become as neutral and impersonal as a standardized sepulture.The film is full of other haunting images, one of them that shall not be missed, is a brief shot on Maude's arm, that might explain why she rejects everything that compact us to masses, and embrace what makes us unique in life and sing \"If You Want to Sing, Just Sing\". And I guess that's what Harold found in Maude, a person who didn't treat him as a freak but someone who was looking for answers even if he couldn't formulate the questions. Now, is that a good enough a reason to make the beautiful friendship blossom into a romance?I don't think the age gap should be problematic at all, once you admit that the person you love makes you want to be a better man, you know that this person is meant for you. I can't think of any actress who could have pulled a performance like Gordon, she's a real peach and makes every line both funny and poignant, she's the sum of all positive wisdoms that could enrich a life even within tragedy and Cort evolves from an introverted and secretive adolescent to a young man capable to express his feelings, to be capable to make the kind of stuff he'd be speaking in the locker room or anywhere. Am I rationalizing a film that is too bizarre for its own good? It was panned by many prestigious critics like Ebert or Canby for being too unnatural or aggressive but I only found gentleness and sweetness wrapped up in black comedy because there's got to be a package and the so underrated Hal Ashby couldn't just adapt a movie adapted from the thesis of a college student (Colin Higgins) without maintaining an air of vital eccentricity. The tone can be weird, but the message is straight-forward and inspirational, the actors are all perfect and Cat Stevens' soundtrack is just the cherry of the cake of posterity.I think the film was ill-received first because we despise eccentricity in our lifetime but once we get closer to Maude's age, we regret these little moments where we could just be free to be whatever we wanted. A film like \"Harold and Maude\" is precious in the way it teaches the value of life before it's too late... and this is why with time, it became a classic for the ages. And a beloved one.",

            "content": "Everybody\u2014and I mean everybody\u2014has a classic that he or she simply does not enjoy. And it for me, it's 1971's \"Harold and Maude.\" Now I am fully aware that by panning this film, that I am standing out very far against the majority. Most people think of \"Harold and Maude\" as a cult classic; as a funny, offbeat, and one of the most interesting dark comedies every made. Well, I'd most certainly agree with interesting (in terms of how nothing in it was to be expected), but I would substitute funny and offbeat with appalling and off-putting with only a handful of humorous moments.The plot is absolutely preposterous and not one that really intrigued me to begin with. Bud Cort stars in the film as a young, death-obsessed man still living with his mother. He is so obsessed with dying and scaring people that he's attempted to scare his mother and other people by faking his own suicide with a variety of unimaginative methods. Then he comes upon and falls in love with a seventy-nine-year-old woman whose just as obsessed with life as he is with death. And together, they embark on a series of wild and eventually romantic adventures.Weird! Now the plot of the movie itself is very off-putting and let me warn you that the content that follows especially within the last third of the movie is most certainly wrongheaded and disturbing in a bad way. For the first two-thirds, I was not enormously entertained, I probably still wouldn't have recommended the movie, but I wasn't appalled. Then in that third act, it goes so over the top, so self-incriminating, and ultimately the movie shoots it's already-weak self in the foot and falls like a ton of bricks. The third act my itself destroyed the movie for me because it was completely creepy to me. And in the worst way possible. Now, I am not against being creeped or grossed out in a movie, but it has to be done right. I still consider \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991) as the creepiest movie I've ever seen and graphically, it's more disturbing than \"Harold and Maude\", but the content of \"The Silence of the Lambs\" is, strangely, off-putting in a fantastic way. How it's treated here in \"Harold and Maude\" is wrong in literally every sense, it's disturbing, and left me eager for the credits to roll and overjoyed when at last they finally did appear.Now \"Harold and Maude\" is not a COMPLETE disaster for me, but it's only a hair's length away from being one. It's saved from being a catastrophe and ends up just being mediocre because there were three genuinely humorous moments in the film that were not off-putting, not creepy in a bad sense, and were imaginative and welcome. They boosted up my rating for this movie a little, but still not enough to save it. I will commend the two actors Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort for good performances of off-putting characters and the cinematographer John A. Alonzo for the noir look of the movie.But still, in the end, \"Harold and Maude\" proved to be nothing to me but a grim, disturbing, and eventually and appalling excuse for a romantic comedy that I also fear will offend a great many people over a broad variety for various reasons. Again, I am completely aware that I stand with the minority\u2014a very tiny minority\u2014but I would be lying if I were to say that I liked this movie. To some, this alone will be proof of my worthlessness as a reviewer, but to you who say this, look at yourselves and then check the IMDb top 250 list and tell me how many classics on it you do not enjoy. This is one of the few for me, but it exists.",

If you like Ruth, this is a film you will want to watch although she is in better films than this one. This film is a dark comedy about a young rich brat who drives his control freak mom nuts by faking suicides, & having an affair with a woman (Gordon) old enough to be his grandma. What scared me when I watched it was the woman playing his mom was much more my type than Ruth but that would make this film an incestuous sin.It is an extremely dark comedy which matches the generation it was made in with Nixon still in office & the protests of a Vietnam War that still dragged on when it was released. I would not recommend this to young children now as the suicide theme would be damaging & confusing to a generation now that is more & more prone to it. As far as Gordon's character stealing cars & motorcycles, while it might have been considered amusing & charming then, I don't think it would be considered that way now. This film was a cult favorite of college students in the early 1970's. About that time, all college students were drugged & strung out. I'd say after viewing it, you'd pretty much have to be that way to enjoy it. Multiple viewings really don't enliven that experience. This film is a major contributor to the reason anyone needs to be stoned.I wish AFI had not put it on their list of 100 comedy films, as I can think of several others that belong there. One viewing of it will tell you that AFI sometimes makes mistakes too. It made the list because of a cult following, not because it is a quality film. AFI is as political in it's choices as anyone.",

They meet at a stranger's funeral and forge a friendship which leads to romance. Gummy, somewhat sickly screenplay by Colin Higgins narrowly avoids the grotesque, but not for the reasons you may think. Harold and Maude's more intimate moments are not detailed, however their mawkishly \"free\" friendship is, and in these instances Higgins has no shame. He throws in cutesy scenes for a cheap kick, and then finishes with a question-mark that would be a lot more thoughtful if the movie itself hadn't been such a doodle. The picture looks brackish and glum, and Bud Cort is a difficult actor to get a grip on (it takes a while to become comfortable with him, which might explain why fans of the film have seen it multiple times--the initial unease has to wear off). Ruth Gordon gives just what you expect from her; she isn't shy, yet she's shrewd not to overplay her ballsy appeal. Hal Ashby directed (in wistful spirits) and the Cat Stevens songs, though repetitive, give the film a whimsically melancholy feel. **1/2 from ****",

I was only vaguely aware of this film until I was of adult age(I am about the same age as this film and yet it was something of a buried treasure,rarely talked about and mostly popularized by word-of-mouth over the many years after it wwas released),but the concept(and the trailers I spied on another classic film's copy)intrigued me enough to watch this a few years back. What I saw charmed me and affected me in ways that were both disturbing and wonderful.The story's pretty well accounted for:the romance between spoiled,death-obsessed malcontent teen Harold(Bud Cort)and breezy,life-affiriming octogeneraian Maude(stage legend Ruth Gordon, relatively fresh from her praised work on Rosemary's Baby)is something so refreshing and odd,so nervy and strange that we're near forty years since this show's bow and one could DARE studios to try and make a film like it and get no takers! Director Hal Ashby may've not made much in the way of money or immediate headway to this film,but I feel like this actually added to his accumen or legend as a brilliant,daring filmmaker. A fairly spare supporting cast,with fairly quick turns by Ellen Geer(as a near-suicidal drama queen and potential girlfriend of Harold's)and Tom Skerritt(in a quick scene--really a cameo--as a motorcycle cop)are really the only off-hand memorables in a film that is mostly centerred around the two titular characters,the Cat Stevens compositions and the spare,stark yet muted scenery. A rare gem of a movie that may vex and confound some--maybe many--but a touching and odd story that truly earns the praise it gets.",

No movie today would get away with suicide jokes, but this movie does, because of how carefree it goes about it. It's suicide slapstick, which to be fair, shouldn't exist as it's own genre. I believed in the romance, despite seeming so taboo. It 's a cult hit, but I think it would be a massive hit today, because audiences are more open to unorthodox romances.

            "content": "\"Harold and Maude\" was the film from almost 45 years ago that brought Bud Cort to attention and a Golden Globe nomination. Sadly, he was out of the limelight as quickly as he entered it although you can still see him act here and there in his 60s today. Not so Ruth Gordon. She was already an Academy award winner and one of the most respected actresses of her generation at that point. Director Hal Ashby also had an Oscar already at this point, for his editing work in a previous film. \"Picket Faences\" lovers will enjoy Tim Skerritt in his small appearance here. This one runs for 90 minutes and features several Cat Stevens songs, a very beautiful one at the start already.Harold plays suicide pranks for most of the film. His mother is well aware of his tendencies, so she doesn't even panic anymore. Not so the girls she brings to meet her son. Harold, however, only is interested in Maude, an old lady he builds a non-sexual relationship with which becomes stronger and stronger as the film progresses. Gordon gives a very fine performance here. If you want to see more from her, I recommend the Columbo episode she starred in. It\u00c4s tough to say if this is really more of a comedy or drama. Maybe that is also why the film missed out on a comedy Golden Globe nomination despite its two leads getting in. There are some funny scenes, for example when Harold's mom takes the test with him, or I should probably say for him. The suicide attempts I don't know if they are funny. They got a bit repetitive though.The emotional dramatic highlight for me was when he talks to Maude about his childhood and the fire. A truly sad scene. It had even more impact to me as the actual ending. I did not really like it that much. Maude seemed like she was enjoying every minute of life and then she randomly goes in the last 5 minutes of the movie. Sure, you could argue she is the type who decides when it is time to go and not let anybody else make that decision, not even God, but it just didn't feel right to me anyway. What I liked better was the one camera shot on her Nazi tattoo. It would have not been so effective on its own, but with her talk about kings earlier on, it made perfectly sense. I also liked the very last scene with how we see him standing up there and the car gone. It seems like the fact that he got out in time shows that his desire for suicide is pretty much gone, so no more attempts in the future perhaps. He perceives death as loss now with Maude gone and not as something to aim for anymore.All in all, it is a good movie and I recommend it. It's not one of my absolute favorites, but it's pretty solid. It's not a waste of time at all, but it's difficult to point out exactly as I personally felt something was missing for greatness or a higher rating, but go decide for yourself and watch it.",

            "content": "Life and Death are explored in cinema frequently and films have been created juxtaposing the two themes years before this came out but none has had the ability to make the heavy themes be condensed in a neat little story tied by love. I didn't love it the first time I watched it because I felt it lacked a little texture and Harold's attempts seemed more shocking rather than funny. But oh how much a second viewing can change one's point of view.Colin Higgins wrote the screenplay for this film. Higgins hasn't got a lot of films in his resume but he has written 3 feature films that are decent. Harold and Maude's screenplay does lack an aim and that is one reason why I couldn't really grasp it the first time, but coming back to this I started to understand what Higgins was trying to exhibit. The themes life and death could not be more plainly obvious than it does in this film but the film avoids from being too campy by creating humor and putting these characters in unconventional environments and situations. Harold is a complex character, to truly understand him one must not wait for answers and insight to be given but instead look for it and empathise on his current state. Maude is the complete opposite of Harold and that's the reason that she took an interest in him as if she knew that he was an empty void needing something to cling onto. His 'attempts' may be a bit dark for some people, which was true in my first viewing, but it does come off as hilarious the second time knowing just how far it goes. Harold and his mother is a relationship that always had me thinking, and as more of Harold's layers climb to the surface, the more we understand the decisions of his actions.This is Hal Ashby's second film and he has definitely did a great job here. Ashby seems to be much more concerned with investigating the themes of the film rather than making the story shine. This prevents the film from feeling campy and predictable, which is probably the reason why people keep coming back to this. Ashby has been known to make more films within the lighter side of the spectrum in terms of it's tone, and this film keeps that but due to it's dark subject matter, it creates an atmosphere that can be seen as darkly hilarious or twistedly sick; also something that is much more risky and unique. The film doesn't move very fast because the film indulges on it's comedic moments, which I like as some directors get too self-conscious and avoids this approach to gain more respect from the casual viewer. The film doesn't feel big and it does seem like it was restricted by it's budget, which turned out as a positive as it gave the film that indie and simple style that it needed in order to keep the film grounded.John Alonzo is the film's cinematographer for Harold and Maude. Alonzo definitely understands the film's themes as his photography supports it so well. He ensures that the house that Harold lives in feels empty and melancholy. Harold within this household is always hit with dark shadows and colors never seem to pop except for the color red. In Maude's home, it does feel much more upbeat and fun with the background of the shots being subtly filled up with little things from Maude's past. As the film moves back and forth between Harold's life at home and his life with Maude, the photography becomes more of a metaphor of Harold's emotional state when within these domains. The film never looks pretty, and it also doesn't have the benefit of having ambitious locations to shoot in, but Ashby and Alonzo does make the most out of it. This film is only the third feature film that Alonzo has worked on, with many of his previous work being in televisions and documentaries, ergo his lack of experience held the film back from being too pretentious or clever.Harold and Maude is a soundtrack driven film, and what a soundtrack list this film has. The songs that come arrive at the perfect moment and they all sound so pessimistically fun, kind of like a balance between the two personalities of the characters. When the songs come on, it had me tapping my feet and tilting my head from side to side along with the beat. I don't think this film feels like it needed a score because that would undercut the humor that this film has to offer.Bud Cort was superb as Harold as he was able to play a character who was emotionally and psychologically tortured, but also deliver the comedic timing that Ashby wanted from him. Ruth Gordon is a seasoned actress who has worked on many classics, like Rosemary's Baby and Edge of Darkness, and this film belongs with the stature that these classics are currently on. When the film focuses on the titular characters, Maude is the one that is always rambling and Gordon was able to achieve that without having the audience feeling annoyed of her. Vivian Pickles plays as Harold's mother and her character is similar to Maude due to the fact that she rambles on in every scene she is in, but she was able to come off as annoying as intended by the director.Harold and Maude isn't for everyone but the protagonists are so different from each other that you can't help but be intrigued on how it plays out. Also, Harold's hilarious suicide attempts gives the film that dark edge that it needed in making this film fun to watch over and over.",

            "content": "Pretty recently I had heard quite a bit about Harold and Maude, from my 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book and from my sister. When her and I were teasing each other on movies we did not see, she brought this up and told me how I had to see it. So, I finally came across it at Hollywood Video and figured what the heck? My sister is into very strange films, but this was also on COMEDY'S 100 funniest movies of all time, so I needed a good laugh. The movie started off a little strange, but then everything came more together and when Maude came in, this movie just took off. I couldn't believe how much Maude rocked, she is everything I want to be at 21 years old.Harold is a young man who has no direction in life, his one pleasure is going to a funeral, even if he did not know the person, but there he meets 79 year old Maude, she shares the same passion as he does. On top of that, she steals cars, trees, and has the strongest passion for life while Harold is finding ways to fake a suicide to freak his mom out. But together they find a little romance and bring out the best in each other, even if no one else can see that.Harold and Maude is possibly one of the most unique and original stories I have watched, it was so strange and off putting, yet it worked and became a masterpiece that any film lover would enjoy. It truly deserves it's praise and more, it had wonderful acting, great chemistry, and a very original story. The 70's were a quirky time, but also a great time for movies! 10/10",

He finds, Maude, an elderly hippie with her own version of life and death and spirituality. Together they enjoy each other's company and end up having sex. Harold horrifies everyone by telling them he's going to marry Maude. The film makes everyone except for Harold and Maude look like complete idiots or worse. It insults religious faith and the military and society in general.Of course, after all of Maude's exaltations of the wonder of life, she takes enough pills to commit suicide. Why? We are never told but it clearly conflicts with Maude's joy of life teachings. Anyway, Maude dies and Harold is so depressed about losing Maude, that he drives his car off a cliff, jumping out in time to dance and play a banjo on the cliff-side. Thus, celebrating life.No doubt, this film is unique, yet the writer and director have a warped sense of life itself and as such are incapable of truly teaching the joy's of life. They attack religious faith and miss out how faith makes life all the more joyful. They attack the tradition of military defense against those that hate freedom and liberty. The very basis of our ability to enjoy life is achieved by those that have given up their lives so that others, like Harold and Maude, can squander it by belching their idiotic drivel.Harold takes from society but gives nothing back. His family is wealthy and he chooses not to work but instead to spend all his time indulging in his morbid fantasies. Maybe if he got a job and became an active participant in society he wouldn't find his life so empty. He's a pathetic moron and Maude is little more than a senile lunatic that should have been committed.This film misses the point by a long shot since the film-makers themselves have demonstrated that they couldn't possibly imagine what the real joys of life include.",

The beginning is a little slow. There is nothing flashy at all about this movie. It is as straightforward as Maude. Unfortunately I have a feeling that the story would be lost on today's youth which is a true shame. This movie got me through some of my lowest points in life. It is tied with The Wall for my all-time favorite movie which is interesting because one would be hard-pressed to find two such diametrically opposed films. This is a \"must see\".

This is one of the greatest, most uniquely conceived, and subtly informing films of cinema's young but rich history.On a surefire course to suicide, Harold (Bud Cort) is an affluent, despondent young man immersed in his own head. Maude (Ruth Gordon) is an old woman, living in a train car, yet filled with energies and eccentricities and a pervasive lust for life (she imagines a future incarnation in which she lives as a sunflower). What a terrific story conceit to have these two counterpoints improbably converge and give rise to each other's highly individualized character sketches. Their unusual but deeply connected affair is set to be made carnal on Maude's 80th birthday.\"Harold and Maude\" entered the cultural conversation through an unmarked door, and at the apex of the Vietnam War -- there's a sense of anti-establishment and selective ignorance of social principals lurking beneath the film's plain brown wrapper which surely explains its appeal in its day. It also accounts for its enduring growth, and status as a true cult classic. \"Harold and Maude\" is cut from a unique cloth, and to an extent to which few films can boast.\n-\nWas this review of use to you?

He falls in love with Maude and wants to marry her.Nowadays a young man making love to a much older woman would not even be considered to be out of the ordinary. Back in 1971 this film would had been viewed as creepy and disturbing.Bud Cort has a wide eyed innocence that masks his macabre thoughts and troubled mind. Essentially he is lonely, he feels unloved by his mother. Only Maude breaks through.The film has plenty of Cat Stevens songs, he even makes a cameo appearance.

Hal Ashby constantly blurs the line between reality and imagination in this existential comedy-drama by using bizarrely hallucinatory sequences and abstract staging of scenes. The oddball nature of some scenes truly verge on slapstick comedy and I think the film deliberately plays these scenes for comedic effect.The film works because of the peculiar chemistry between Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon. Overall it didn't leave a very lasting effect in my mind, but it's certainly a cute little film that can be enjoyed.",

            "content": "Poor Hal Ashby. When people are asked to recall the great directors of the 1970s, Ashby, cinema's great wounded heart, often gets left out. But Ashby made a string of masterpieces in the 1970s. Afterwards his career took a giant nosedive. He had a depressive and suicidal personality (his father also committed suicide), and when the world of film failed to provide him with solace, he turned to drugs and alcohol. Due to his self-destructive behaviour, his subsequent films were all taken away from him during post production. As a result, they're mostly a mess.But in his prime, Ashby's films were tremendous. Particularly \"Harold and Maude\", the story of a wealthy young man (Harold) and his budding relationship with an elderly woman called Maude. With his bug-eyes and perpetually forlorn face, Harold looks like he belongs in a Tim Burton cartoon. An outsider who hates a world which has long rejected him, Harold spends his days in an existential funk, moody, depressed, and always fantasising about death and suicide. Because his mother leads a vapid life, fawning over items, money and prosaic house parties, Harold stages suicides in an attempt to get her to sympathise with his dour world view. Life lasts only an instant, he thinks, why waste it gathering this junk? Of course the flip side is true. Life lasts only an instant, so why live it worrying about death?Patriotism, religion, politics, capitalism, family, science...these are all ideals Harold rejects. In this regard Ashby gives us several symbolic mouthpieces (a psychiatrist, a dim mother, a military uncle, a silly priest), all of whom fail to offer Harold any tolerable moral framework. Enter Maude, a 79 year old woman who shows Harold some of the joys of life and shares with him her personal philosophies. She says that she enjoys watching things \"grow, bloom, fade, die and change into something else\" and shares with Harold her desire to be \"reincarnated as a sunflower\". Harold tells her that he would like to be a daisy, because \"daisies are all the same\". This desire signifies, of course, Harold's desire to be \"normal\" and accepted by society. However Maude shows Harold that the daisies are actually all different in their own ways and explains that one of the main problems in society, and a cause of much of the world's sorrow, are people who sacrifice their individuality in order to conform or fit in with others.Ashby portrays Harold's acceptance of this message (yeah, it's a hokey message, but Ashby was a full blown hippie) beautifully. The moment Harold learns to accept himself, Ashby's camera pulls out and shows him surrounded by a field of sunflowers. This recalls an earlier pull-out in which Harold was surrounded by a field of tombstones. Death has been replaced with life, Harold finally on his road to recovery.Throughout the film, Maude serves as an embodiment of a kind of uninhibitedness or freedom. She's constantly stealing cars, not only to show that people don't have a hold of things, but because she wants to try them all. She wants to experience everything. When Harold gives Maude an \"I love you bracelet\" she promptly throws it into the ocean. Likewise, when Harold resolves to marry her, she promptly takes a suicide pill. Why? Perhaps Because Harold has learnt to love and she wants him to love more than she can ever be. But also, because she wants Harold to understand that fickle balance between life, love and loss. Love now because tomorrow might not come.Late in the film we realise that Maude is a Holocaust survivor (she lives in a railroad car much similar to the ones used to tow Jews). She also has a concentration camp ID number tattooed on her arm, death permanently seared into her flesh. She's optimistic despite having suffered horrors and hardship, whilst Harold, a son of affluence who seems to have it all, is forever morbid simply because he has nothing to live for. In this way, Maude embodies the gruff men and women of the WW2 generation, whilst Harold is symbolic of the post Vietnam era, disillusioned, directionless, anhedonic and frustrated. After Maude's death (which Ashby shoots with powerful juxtapositions), Harold pushes his car (it's a funeral hearse) off a cliff. He then walks off playing the banjo she gave him, the image recalling the Woody Guthrie of Ashby's \"Bound For Glory\". Harold's died and been reborn, having resolved to embrace Maude's anarchic sensibilities, her personal values, her love and optimism. How cute.9/10 - Like most of Hal Ashby's work, \"Harold and Maude\" manages to be both uplifting and brutally dark. The film may have a hokey, hippie vibe, but this was new at the time (the film looks nothing like a film made in 1971) and Ashby's sincerity sells it.It's ironic that the director of such an optimistic film - a film in which a troubled kid rejects suicide - would himself embrace such self destructive traits. Why didn't Hal Ashby practise what he preached? It's hard to change yourself. Maybe we can't. Or maybe Ashby simply didn't have a teacher like Maude.Worth two viewings.",

Yes, sometimes it's funny but mostly just an excuse for \"Maude\" to give us her dumb New Age philosophies.

Yet elements of this movie seem derivative or at least \"of its period\" - consider Easy Rider, The Graduate, Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex, etc.  All much more interesting.It is the lack of character development that particularly grates with me. What motivates Maude?  Is she an eco-warrior, a psychologically scarred holocaust survivor or just \"The Little Old Lady From Pasadena\" having a last laugh before she dies?  Of course there is some fun with Harold's fake suicide theatricals - the live funeral pyre routine being the best of those.Cat Stevens was at the height of his powers when this film was made and his superb sound track kept me motivated sufficiently to see the movie through.

She fills out a questionnaire for him, reciting all the questions posed by the survey and then answering them as she herself believes, rather than waiting for Harold's answer. VIVIAN PICKLE does a rib-tickling job as the mother.RUTH GORDON and BUD CORT play their roles straight, he with an expression of angelic innocence and a rather blank stare, and she with her customary skill at portraying zaniness with an air of eccentricity that is engaging.It all moves very swiftly and tells its tale in an hour-and-a-half, well within the limits of its slight story. The Cat Stevens songs on the soundtrack add a piquancy to the tale, but the ending is just a tad bit disappointing. On a cheery note, we note that Harold has now taken up a musical instrument and intends to live a little as he walks jauntily away from the camera on a hilltop.Summing up: You won't know whether to laugh or cry in some places, but it's a rather sweet little story beautifully executed.",

            "content": "Hal Ashby's Harold and Maude attained cult status for its portrayal of a morbid youth who falls in love with a spirited woman not twice, but four times his age. Harold is a withdrawn rich boy who has a proclivity for staging elaborate - often gory - \"suicides\" to torment his very-proper control-freak of a mother, who remains blissfully unaffected by his theatrics. When he is not trying get a rise from his maternally inept mother, he is attending funerals of complete strangers, just for the fun of it. It's at one of these staid ceremonies that he meets the free-spirited octogenarian Maude. It turns out that attending strangers' funerals is about the only thing they have in common, which is why they turn out to be a match made in heaven. Soon they are spending time together, and Maude's full-throttle zest for life opens Harold up to its possibilities. His death obsession remains, but it begins to recede as Maude's life-affirming philosophies, however oddly enacted in her anything-goes lifestyle, cuts through his malaise. She speaks in hippie-friendly aphorisms, but coming from the mouth of such a delicately poised octogenarian, they take on the weight of accumulated wisdom. More than a friend or lover, Maude infects Harold with her carpe diem attitude, freeing him from the inner demons of boredom and self-pity. The pair soon fall into a romantic relationship that shouts in the face of societal mores. It's a disquieting premise for a movie, certainly, but to dwell on the age difference of the characters is to miss the movie's point. Part of the beauty of Harold and Maude is the way you quickly lose sight of the age difference between Harold and Maude and begin to see them simply as people who connect and love each other. They are oddballs in a world that doesn't understand or appreciate them, although the film sidesteps simple us-versus-them banality by portraying the establishment as kooky in its own right. The film spends much of its time in a unique space between reality and farce, towing a fine line that director Hal Ashby maintains with seemingly effortless grace. Its bleak morbidity is uncommonly matched by its over-the-top hilarity (Harold's long series of faux suicide attempts are hysterical), buoyed by Cat Stevens' amazing pop soundtrack, providing just the right wistful, mournful touch for this glimmering jewel of a movie. The casting is impeccable. With his baby face and elfin eyes, Bud Cort looks much younger than his age, which makes some of his antics seem even more childlike. Yet, once he spends time with Maude, he seems to mature in front of us, losing the angry-child glint in his eyes and becoming a reformed innocent. Ruth Gordon's sprightliness lends the perfect counterbalance to Bud, as she plays Maude as a one-of-a-kind without turning her into a kook. She evinces such sweetness and genuine care for what she loves that you can't help but admire her constancy.By turns funny, moving and outrageous - sometimes all at once - the film is Hal Ashby's masterpiece, thanks in no small part to Colin Higgins' nearly perfect screenplay and the incredible performances by everyone. If you've never seen Harold and Maude, that needs correcting.",

Maude is a hyperactive, unconventional, kleptomaniac. As a holocaust survivor we are supposed to forgive the fact she steals whatever she wants while spouting truisms. I presume we're supposed to take away the message that life holds many wonders as long as we don't waste time trying to fit in or observe social norms.

The man and woman aforementioned may be a teenage boy and a 79 year old woman, but that is only surface detail that may work to draw one into the deep meaning of the connection between the two. And that connection expunges the surface detail of that long transit of age between them. The sexual revolution not only gave more leeway for the young to experiment sexually. Director Hal Ashby reminds us here that that revolution need not be just for the young, and that there should be a more holistic meaning of freedom. In the context of this movie, a freedom not limited to age. Set during the uncertain latter days of the rights revolutions in the early seventies, Maude is an original player in the social protests from the early 20th century Progressive era. To her, the Sixties hoopla is but old news, or rather universal and transcending ideas, attitudes and feelings that transmorph into new threads from olde wares. She has already participated in her collective revolution, and now she takes care of the personal. Harold is a teenage boy who finds both a dark amusement and psychologically necessary outlet in pretending to kill himself . His morbidity and her lust for life brings them together at a funeral they're both attending just for the hell\u2013or the life (cycle)\u2013 of it: one does it due to a dark obsession with death, and the other to participate in the sacred and infinite life and death cycles of nature. This mutual coming together over death provides the launching pad of their intimate and unusual relationship. The movie's uplifting call for life to be lived instead of to be moped and grieved is expressed genuinely and genuinely felt by the creators and more perceptive viewers respectively. It wins for its celebration of true love and what it really means to truly love. The transcendent qualities of love are of paramount importance here: it doesn't bother Harold that the woman he loves is so sundered from him in experience and age, and it doesn't bother Maude that a young man with some serious mental issues, because want keeps them enamoured of each other extinguishes those other distances. Their quirky but perfectly natural bond is stuff that make one breath a little bit easier, with the reassuring idea that there is something someone for everyone no matter how old or weird and alienated one is. I hate describing such a nuanced film with such tired clich\u00e9s; please don't let those deter you from thinking it's any good. This film is anything but a clich\u00e9; if fact, it is one of the most unique love stories before of since. I could go on and write about the subtle and naturalistic acting, like for instance the facial gestures that are crucial but often overlooked by more recent viewers, the speechless moments where communication is expressed flawlessly without speech, but I'll just leave it at that. My subjective measure of this film definitely has to be a 10.",

For fun, Harold goes to funerals. It is on one of these outings that he meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a lively woman who will turn eighty in a few weeks. Surprisingly, they hit it off, and Harold begins spending a great deal of time with Maude, who starts teaching him some of life's most important lessons. Harold learns, but the last lesson Maude has to teach him may be more than he can live with.This is an absolutely brilliant script - funny, poignant, intelligent. And the points it makes about life are indeed very important. But mostly, it's just a delightful romp that sweeps you along in its current, laughing all the way.The acting is wonderful. Vivian Pickles' performance as Harold's mother is perfect, playing Mrs. Chasen as a woman who attempts to control her son, only to be controlled by him. Shari Summers, Judy Engles, and Ellen Geer, all have excellent cameos as Harold's hapless dates. Bud Cort does a phenomenal job in giving a deadpan rendering of Harold. But arguably the movie is Ruth Gordon's as she carries the film with delightful results.While the movie makes some interesting statements about life, the living of it, and the ending of it, mostly it's just a lot of fun, which is the best recommendation I can give for watching it.",

There may be a little message -- about the idle rich, the spoiled rich finding no meaning in life. Certainly, no joy. As much as Ruth Gordon's Maude tries to convince to the contrary, there is no life in the empty, self-absorbed existence that she and Bud Cort's Harold pursue. Rather, it's an escapist, fantasy existence. They don't look for meaning. They just want a different experience \u0085 time after time after time. They are delusional. This film is billed as a comedy, drama and romance. I wonder if people who have lost someone close by suicide could see any comedy in Harold's obsession with it. Or his attempts at humor by faking suicide. Or is it really that funny to see an octogenarian squeal a car in circles around a police officer or in an intersection? Perhaps this film is something Timothy Leary would have seen or imagined on LSD. I can't imagine anyone being entertained by this drivel. My two stars are for some beautiful coastal scenic shots.

No. I am not opposed to Stevens and his music, but it never felt right and always brought me out of the film.Roger Ebert gave the film a lukewarm review, and I can sympathize. I love the concept of a man obsessed with death, and the suicide attempts were pure genius... even the idea of a young man who is turned on to life by someone who is elderly is a beautiful thought.

They are at different points in their lives but they instantly connect and become companions.It's difficult to explain what makes this all work so well other than on paper it seems like it could be a disaster.

            "content": "It's hard to believe a film such as \"Harold and Maude\" was made in the 1970s. Movies like this one, the off-kilter teen coming-of-age story, haven't really become common place until today. Hal Ashby and Colin Higgins' film was undoubtedly ahead of its time. It's not rooted in pop culture, popular folk-style music is a central element and its sense of humor is a one- of-a-kind blend of dark and free-spirited. Teenagers of today would have an appreciation of it that teenagers in 1971 probably didn't have. It was still probably uncomfortable for a lot of people to embrace the relationship of an older teenager and a crazy old woman, but it's a thing of beauty in this movie.Bud Cort stars as Harold, a morbid teenager obsessed with faking his own suicide, likely because he's been raised in a mansion by his self-centered mother his entirely life. Although a bit repetitive, Ashby creates some of the most memorable scenes on film, like when Harold's mother fills out a matchmaking survey for her son and answers every question for him based on what she thinks while the entire time, Harold is brandishing a pistol and pointing it at her and himself. At one point she can't take it anymore, so Harold sees a shrink, who is of no help.One of Harold's favorite activities is attending funerals, and on one occasion he meets Maude, an old woman with no sense of logic who is just shy of her 80th birthday. Played by Oscar- winner Ruth Gordon, she is a delightful character. Gordon paints her as cuckoo but completely lovable, even if she's a nutjob. She and Harold spend a lot of time together and she enlightens him with her strange but wonderful world view. Their relationship is about teaching the death-obsessed Harold about what it means to live.Maude is a special soul. Her attitude is inspiring. She might be crazy in her ways, but she's as wise as any person experienced in years. There are countless of surprisingly powerful moments from this film, but one great example is of Maude telling Harold how in a field of daisies, each is different though they may look the same. She pities those who see themselves as the latter and not the former. Ashby pulls away to a pan of a huge cemetery where the two can't be seen among the thousands of identical graves. That's a vital theme, really relevant stuff in a coming-of-age story. The fact that there's anything profound in this story is impressive.\"Harold and Maude\" is also funny in a mature way. Nothing is recycled physical humor and as many ways as we see Harold pretend to kill himself, the way it juxtaposes with other elements of the story such as his ignorant mother is true comedy. Higgins and Ashby are all about defying expectation and its really smoothly worked in throughout the movie.I won't spoil the film, but there's one scene that makes \"Harold and Maude\" a masterful film and not just an ordinary quirky comedy. Normally when you drop a knowledge bomb on your audience, you expect it to sharply impact the rest of the film. It's just merely included here, added to what you know about the complex characters and the fact that it doesn't get so much attention makes it so powerful. Few comedies ever achieve great touching moments like these and that's part of what makes \"Harold and Maude\" timeless.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",

            "content": "A suicide obsessed young rich kid meets up with an eighty year old \"free sprite\" at a funeral - for someone neither knows - and starts an unlikely \"love\" affair.A bittersweet movie unlike any other that has been made before or since. The world cult could have been invented for this film. Indeed it is featured in many books on cult movies - including Danny Peary's wonderful work Cult Movies - now in its third edition. (The first two are must-reads for cult movie fans. The third I haven't even flicked through.)On one hand it has a limited agenda: while on the other it leaves a lasting impression and takes you places that you have never been before. This is as unique a mainstream-targeted studio movie as I have ever seen outside of Psycho. (In the same way that Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven was the first an anti-western western this is the first anti-romance romance!)Cort is just so good as the blank-eyed young man who, it seems, is a manic practical joker - but a manic joker that never laughs at his own jokes or even seen enjoying them. His mother - who seems to be the main target - generally ignores him as if he was a spoilt brat showing off. Which maybe he is. Maybe the lack of a father figure is my significant clue? (A joke needs an audience or it is pointless. Who is the audience for his jokes - it can't be us because we are not supposed to be there!)I question Cort's sexuality. What is it? An asexual maybe?Certainly he shows no interest in women, indeed he seems hell bent on making them squeal with his bloody stunts. Who could love this self-obsessed pasty-faced personality disorder in real life? He is doing the girls - who his mother sets him up with via a computer dating agency - a favour by chasing them away.He sees his ideal mate in the old lady (Ruth Gordon) he meets up with at the funeral - but is she not just a fellow misfit who intrigues him? Maybe more a fellow traveler than a lover. We learn - later in the movie - she has been in a concentration camp? So she can take other people's cars and vehicles because of this? While this is a black comedy looking for laughs wherever it can find them, is this not a sin as well as illegal? Jean-Paul Sartre said \"all property is theft\", but how would react if someone took her possessions? Would we laugh at a scene where we saw a male burglar climbing in through the window and taking her TV because he hadn't one of his own? I doubt it.This has an atmosphere that I cannot really pin-down. The world is just a giant playground in which to play jokes and try and find entertainment. Work is for others. Bad things have happened - The Holocaust being the headline event - but life is only for living. Even when it focuses on the dead and the dying!Despite being a fan, I am not sure the Cat Stevens soundtrack works - generally too upbeat and optimistic. It would be better served with underlining classical strings rather than acoustic guitar-driven bouncy pop.Whether you fit in this parallel universe or want to visit is up to you - but it dragged me in for its ninety minutes. It even made me laugh out loud a few times as well. Black comedy is rare and a good black comedy is even rarer still. If you can forgive the bad messages and some of the fudges it is a very touching product.",

            "content": "Several Cat Stevens songs appear in this film which were never released on an album until Stevens' greatest hits albums. The song, arguably debuted by Ruth Gordon about midway, carries the message of the film: \"If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\". Harold (Bud Cort), the only child of a filthy-rich family, a disturbed college-age youth engages in black-humor episodes: he fakes committing suicide. As the film progresses his suicides become more elaborate, beginning with hanging, but then moving onto drowning and shooting himself. His second \"suicide\" is so gruesome, his single mother doesn't know what to do with him, so she hires a psychologist who becomes as flustered with Harold as his mother.For fun, Harold buys a used Hearse and attends funerals of people he doesn't know. There he notices Maude (Ruth Gordon), an older woman with the spunk of a 25-year-old. She also likes to attend funerals but she has other habits as well. She likes to steal cars, not the least of which is a Volkswagon Bug driven by the priest at a couple of the funerals. She then starts driving Harold's Hearse after one of the funerals and offers to give Harold a ride home. He explains the Hearse is his car to which Maude replies \"Then you should give me a ride home.\" And so begins a rather quirky relationship between a reclusive youth and an older woman who could make Madonna seem like a fuddy-duddy. At one point she even one-up's a motorcycle cop played by Tom Skerritt.The most insufferable character of the film is neither Harold nor Maude but Harold's mother. Mrs. Chasen (Vivian Pickles) never engages with her son except to be outraged at his suicide episodes. More often she knows what he's up to and simply speaks with him normally when he appears to be \"dead\". What makes her insufferable is her detachment from him. She decides Harold needs to meet women and she signs him up for a computer dating service. She fills out the questionnaires and chooses the women without his input. At several of the meetings with the \"prospects\", Harold yet again engages in his \"suicides\", often with horrific consternation on the part of the dating prospect.Although definitely not for all tastes, \"Harold and Maude\" has become a cult classic. While there's not really a \"plot\" per se but more of a character study, themes of death and life permeate the entire story. At film's beginning, we learn that Harold seems to be going through life on autopilot except for his suicide episodes. Because of his interest in funerals, he seems preoccupied by \"death\". The origin of this compulsion is finally revealed to Maude about 2/3rds through the film. On the other side, Maude is a free spirit and Harold learns that he may need to take risks to enjoy life fully. While I wouldn't recommend trying to outdo a motorcycle cop, the point of Maude's behavior is that we often spend too much time worrying about the approval or disapproval of others instead of just doing those things that let us \"be free\" as the song goes. In other words, death is the price we pay for living life.",

A teenage young boy intrigued with death falls in a love with 80 years old woman who teaches him to how to Live life. Just read it again and imagine this concept getting a quirky and emotional cinematic version. Welcome to the world of Hal Ashby's \"Harold And Maude\". First of all the concept won me over, then then the dialogues and humourous comedy made me go mad over it. The character of Maude was so freaking amusing and pleasant surprising. She was a woman to Love beyond generations gap for sure. Although, it was practically not happening at all and she herself knew it. Harold's Character was bit dull and senseless comparatively but it makes a up a well balanced pair. Maude's perception and carefree attitude towards life will surely make you think about- What's really wrong in giving it a try? Dialogue are powerful and thight provoking. Try this one for trial, \"Everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.\" How's that? After some quirky one liners, life lessons the film has Emotional Portion to leave you in tears in the climax. Bud Cort as Harold was fantastic but Ruth Gorden as stole the show by Margin. Hal Ashby is a genius but highly underrated name and I don't the reasons. I watched his 'Being There' recently and found it one of the most 'Accurate Classic' and now this 'Harold And Maude' seems 2nd consecutive entry in the list. One more thing to notice here is, both of these films were about human behaviour and the changes appeared later. Both the films are getting same Rating but this one is little dumb at one or two occasions whereas 'Being There' was sublime. If you ever feel like quitting this life, just watch (or remember of you have already watched it) Harold And Maude and you will find many reasons to live the life. One could be, Do What you want to do, be carefree from the tension of this virtually emotional world, just be yourself, love and live your life. Thank you Hal Ashby for this Classic Life-lesson that inspired and influenced many Slice-of-Life dramas since then and will do forever. \"If You Want to Sing, Sing Out\" will always be a special song because of this film and will always be playing in my mind to cheer me up whenever i feel depressed in my life.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

The anti-establishment jabs (military, motorcycle cop) still work as hilarious satire. What has changed is my perspective, now that I'm closer in age to Ruth Gordon! And with this most recent viewing, I've found a flaw, though it can be forgiven. I don't buy the suicide. It seems at odds with Maude's joie de vrie, and certainly inconsiderate to Harold.

It's a strange premise where you have Harold who is young, rich and obsessed with death (he keeps fake-murdering himself throughout the movie which is hilarious), who literally falls in love when he meets lively septuagenarian Maude at a funeral.Dark humour done well, an eccentric affair from start to finish.",

Perhaps most would find this movie inappropriate as it makes fun of suicide and shows a different kind of love that isn't accepted in society. The movie may have taken it a little too far with going outside the boundaries of friendship, We accept an older man with a younger woman, but the opposite, not so much. The movie smoothed everything over with its crazy humour. The jokes were fantastic, even if it was wildly outside the norm, but that's what made it so funny.",

            "content": "What makes Ruth Gordon's Maude so surprisingly enchanting is that we don't expect a seventy nine year old to be so full of life, so vivacious, so contrary to her appearance. Of course it seems trite these days because every indie film has copied the same mantra into sexier, younger characters that go about life-affirming journeys into the vast unknown. It works and feels natural here because she doesn't have that infinite lifetime to look forward to, that youthful aimlessness; she's tethered by her age and instead of letting it define her, she makes the most of her time left. Opposing her is Cort's Harold. They both embrace death but with different attitudes - it is ironic that it is the nineteen year old who feels so suffocated by the idea of dying one day as opposed to the seventy nine year old. They are fascinated by it, but for different reasons. Cort is a great casting; gangly, impossibly tall, like an overgrown teenager who hasn't quite physically matured but wants to seem so. During the therapist sessions the formal dress is a mirror image itself, and he initially has the same lofty, cross-legged pose. His blank, unblinking face seems to be deathly close to collapse at any moment; perhaps it is an extra layer of ghostly white make-up (Roy Andersson recalls a similar technique). His deadpan approach is crucial to the dark humour of his 'deaths' that become a running gag. Some of these unfold with an almost magical realism behind them - a figure outside in white cloth sets fire to itself, and Harold walks into the frame the next second. And the same goes for the way he re-appears on the cliff in the ending. The others are hilarious because of the non-reaction of his mother, whom has long become accustomed to these pranks and does not show the emotion that Harold wishes she shows. Her dismissive chuckles as she fills in his dating profile and waves off his shooting in the head, and the funniest reveal of them all, as she gets into her rhythm for her daily laps in the pool, and completely ignores the floating, lifeless body of Harold as if it were just a fallen leaf. Or perhaps the opposite, the hysterical over- reaction from the last date, a thespian who marvels at Harold's act of seppuku, and falls into her own dramatic rendition of the Romeo & Juliet climax. Viewing it from a modern lens Maude's hippie philosophy seems a little less inspiring, and a little more exasperating, especially as she circles around and then steals the police motorcycle. But isn't that sort of perspective exactly what she is trying to combat? Harold admits a desire to fit into society, and if not, he might as well die because there is little else to treasure in this short, miserable existence. Maude accepts that same fleeting view, but pushes him to find that spark and will to live and not waste anymore of his young life moping around because death might be around the corner anyway (and she shows this by throwing away the necklace). And so, farewelling him at eighty, she teaches him the most important lesson of them all. The constant Cat Williams is a little coy, but it's perfect for that soft banjo solo that symbolises a revitalised outlook on life and a goodbye to that former obsessive morbidity (the hearse).",

            "content": "Harold and Maude is neither the cinema's greatest movie, nor is it the worst. Instead, it is a highly original, quirky black comedy that combines inventive characters with a devastating attack on the pillars of America's Establishment.It's no accident that Harold comes from a conformist upper-class family, over which mom presides lavishly, but like a petty demeaning tyrant. Nor is it happenstance that Maude's origins lie outside a youthful US, in an older, more experienced Europe devastated by the death-dealing Holocaust of which she is a survivor. Hers is understood as a life-affirming perspective that has been earned, and stands as the perfect antidote to the zombified Harold, whose soul has shriveled in the midst of repressive norms and repressed instincts. Probably no movie from that rebellious era captures the counter-culture's positive image of itself better than this one. Nor are the forces in conflict more sharply and humorously drawn than the encounters with organized religion, psychiatry, the military, and other of America's domineering institutions. Even at age 80, Maude represents the pure flower child riposte, showing that age is no barrier to affirmative values, while Harold overcomes alienation by at last responding to enlivening people rather than deadening duties. In capsule, we have both the class origin and universal ambitions of that insurgent period, when suburban white kids sought to lead a global parade that would break the shackles that bind us. H&M celebrates that spirit, and while I grow a bit weary of Ruth Gordon's unrelenting girlishness and Harold's hollow-eyed deadpan, they do remain unique and compelling figures. As does the movie, even 40 years later",

            "content": "If you want to talk about absurd, see Harold and Maude. It is the story of the teenage boy, Harold, who is obsessed with death and all things morbid. He's very antisocial and secluded. He finally begins to break out of his shell when he meets Maude, a feisty and spirited old woman. The two eventually fall in love, making for one of the strangest and most irreverent on screen romances you've ever seen.I can really respect Harold and Maude because even though it isn't a flawless film, it is very different and takes a lot of risks. It can be very ambiguous at times and it doesn't hold your hand all the way through. The story itself is obviously very different, but the way it is told is also interesting. It doesn't take the route of your typical storyline. It feels like more of a collection of stories that build to the ending. The overall style of the film is difficult to put into words, but it was a pleasure to watch unfold.I honestly did have a difficult time getting into the story. It begins pretty slow and it wasn't exactly my cup of tea. By the end I can't say I loved the story, but I definitely have to respect it for what it is. The two leads are a delight to watch together. Bud Cort is pretty peculiar through out the movie and personally I had a hard time connecting with him, but Ruth Gordon as Maude is hilarious and a lot of fun. I loved them both by the end of the film.Now my favorite thing about this film was undoubtedly the soundtrack. The music in this film is all music by Cat Stevens. There are some great tunes in the film, and in the context of the story it makes them even better. The music enhances every scene of the film and really gives it a lot of its unique spirit and life. I'm even listening to the soundtrack while writing this review I loved it so much. I'm not even sure I would have liked this film if not for its perfect soundtrack.Harold and Maude is definitely a good movie. I can see how plenty of people would consider it to be a classic, but personally I wasn't crazy about it. I can respect it for its unique 1970's feel. It is definitely not your average film and there are plenty of good things to say about it. Overall I enjoyed it enough to where I think I will remember it down the line, and perhaps even rewatch it with a different attitude.",

            "content": "I only watched it a couple of weeks ago, but holy mother of God, it instantly earned a spot as one of my all time favourites, if not managing to swoop the number one spot.In theory this film should fail. The story of romance between a teenager/young man and elderly woman is far too problematic to be believable. It's not only too bizarre, but it's also extremely unrealistic (sorry, I'm a bit of a cynic). Nevertheless, I'd heard about this film for a long time and was willing to put all preconceptions to one side. And I am so, so glad that I did. I urge anyone to look past the summary and just watch it. Please, do it, now.How can you try and dissect a film as complex and beautiful as Harold and Maude? Well you can't, because it doesn't demand anything of the sort. Some classic/cult/icon films encourage us to re-watch and point our cinematic-analytic lenses to nuances that are key. But Harold and Maude actually exceeds the limits of film; it's an experience.The character of Maude is played exquisitely, and is so charming and free spirited. Harold is Maude diametrical opposite. Morose, pseudo-suicidal, fascinated with death (played BRILLIANTLY by Bud Cort) and the reactions it evokes. He goes to funerals in his spare time, visits his psychiatrist a lot and has no friends...Until he meets Maude. And when he does, the two seem to fit like a glove. They make for one of the most authentic on-screen relationships/friendships I've ever seen, and watching them develop is just...wow. Because the characterisation is so strong (and the film isn't bustling with minor characters)it actually becomes fairly believable, and you'll find yourself embroiled in the world of Harold and Maude. The hospital scene at the end will crush you.Strong message, unique, beautiful, perfect, and also surprisingly hilarious. Charming and unforgettable, overall a very important film that will question our perspectives.",

On the sidewalk are laid out a series of large pots containing plants of varying health. She notices one particularly distressed plant, which she simply must save. So with Harold's help she determines to rescue the plant and transplant it to the forest. The imagination of the writer, the skill of the director, and the passion of the actor make perhaps two dozen of such scenes into little movies of their own.

This movie is a touching romance-drama, it's a hilarious black comedy. It's a subtle movie, it's a movie that goes to every extreme. It's a great guy movie, it's a sad tear-jerking chick flick.

In fact, this film and Cat Stevens' music are basically inseparable in my head at this point.Overall, despite the odd plot of the film, it does a great job being serious and comedic at the right times. The film is overall pretty morbid, but not to an extent that I think most people would have issues viewing it. There's also something especially beautiful about someone as introverted and death-obsessed as Harold falling in love and learning from somebody like Maude. While they're an unlikely couple, it's certainly one that works really well on screen.",

Fantastic performances by all especially Ruth Gordon, Bud Cort, Charles Tyner and Vivian Pickles. Wonderful set design that evokes the 70's and earlier decades (Maude's home is full of character and memorabilia.)The film touches on so many subjects (being a misfit, youth, old age, war, politics, life and death) but for me the main theme is to enjoy life - even the bad stuff. That life is worth living. And that maybe for some of us the only way to understand the precious joy of life is to engage with those who are closer to death.Probably the finest soundtrack of any film entirely by Cat Stevens.",

Harold's \"oddball\" personality is actually that of a child so neglected he's become mentally disturbed to the point where he intentionally sabotages every good thing that happens to him. This movie is written to be a harrowing tale of self-destruction, but it's presented as a happy romcom that tries to convince the viewer that the story is anything other than what it actually is.

Over the years, when I've reflected on it, I've liked it less and less.When I saw it in college, I was taken by the story of how this old woman with her joie de vivre teaches the young Harold to embrace life, rather than running from it as he had been. I also liked the idea of a couple acknowledging their mutual attraction even though the age gap seemed insurmountable.The older I get, the more I see it as a story of an irresponsible old woman using a young man to have one last good time before she kills herself. Selfish and cruel.In this way, it reminds me a lot of another movie from around the same period: The Graduate. I get that people were feeling unmoored and alienated in the 60s, but to turn that into some kind of admirable quality is, well, something that's best appreciated if you're 20 and smoking a lot of weed.Other reviewers have made note of Maude's irresponsible and lawless behavior, so I'll just note it and move on.This is a movie that really only makes sense in the context of its times, and even then, it doesn't really stand out as a great articulation of that time. People deal with uncertainty about the future in a lot of different ways, but I don't think glorifying theft and suicide is a healthy one.Final note: The soundtrack lost any appeal for me when Cat Stevens (now Yusef Islam) endorsed the Ayatollah Khomenei's fatwah against Salman Rushdie.

In spite of the vast emotional, cultural and generational differences between their characters, their romance is completely convincing, if a little unusual.The film does beg a few comparisons to \"The Graduate\": a 20-year-old, disillusioned with his parent(s), ends up in an intergenerational affair, and drives some fast cars in the process. Of course, Benjamin Braddock's affair with Mrs. Robinson was emotionally empty and ultimately very destructive, while Harold and Maude have something much more sincere.

Their relationship, obviously, is the subject of the majority of the story of this highly entertaining film. Maude is your typical elderly lady who likes to steal cars and mouth off to cops who are more interested in arresting her than anything else. While she speeds off after having been pulled over, she laughingly mentioning how the police always like to `play games.' This unique film follows Harold and Maude through their adventures and portrays the development of their highly unlikely mutual love, and the result, strangely enough, is quite good.\nOne of the only negative things that can be said of this film (keeping in mind all of the things that it can get away with, given the kind of film that it is), is that it has dated pretty badly. When watched today, its age is very clear, but at the same time, this does not necessarily take away from the film as a whole.

By losing out on that subtlety, the film loses out on the chance to be truly subversive.  It runs from connection, runs from real emotion, going for cheap laughs instead of the telling gesture.  It's arch where it ought to be sympathetic, snide where it ought to be angry, stylized where it ought to be human.There seems to be a bit of disagreement among some other posters about the use of Maude's tattoo -- I have to agree that it's a sledgehammer gesture, showing a failure by the film.  If Ashby could get his message across more effectively, he wouldn't have to resort to such a ham-handed move.\nHe might as well go for the big trifecta of manipulation by throwing in a big-eared puppy getting hit by a truck and a doe eyed kid getting cancer.Plenty of movies are able to get across the theme of growth (and its losses) without the harshness and shrillness of Harold and Maude -- Roman Holiday, Kolya, Cinema Pardiso, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, even Shrek, for that matter.The reason is that these movies know that you can build a lot more with a screwdriver and crescent wrench than you can with a 14 pound sledge.",

And strangely, the movie suggests by the end that the Maudes of the world are better off running and hiding instead of engaging, challenging, and persuading.If you're looking for a complex, thoughtful, and humorous movie, you'll need to look elsewhere.",

Obviously, a lot of the new directors - including Hal Ashby - wanted to try new kinds of stories. And they did a pretty interesting job with this one.

I think it is to a large extent a \"message\" movie with the message being to enjoy life to the fullest etc with a few side criticisms of matters such as state authority, military and war and the superficial rich. But as I said, if you are watching the movie today you've probably already seen movies with similar critical motifs much more sophisticatedly and interestingly delivered.The singing-dancing theme of the movie with the old lady introducing an element of fun and joy into the gray boys life gives you a feeling of watching some musical with \"the sounds of music\" being the first to come to my mind. Not to my taste.Again with a modern perspective and without trying to delve into the perspective that the film makers had at the time of the films release, the plot concept is a well rehearsed one that has been reproduced with much more sophistication and subtleness over the decades since the 70s. It is not convincing, and not realistic to any extent.In short, compared to contemporary film, crude, banal and slow and boring is how I would describe it.",

Just as the music of Cat Stevens is laughably inferior to the intense, passionate, vibrant music of the time, like Marvin Gaye or the O'Jays or Aretha Franklin or Van Morrison, so is Harold and Maude an empty shadow compared to the truly great movies about alienation and struggle and injustice of the late 60s and 70s.",

Ruth Gordon as Maude was great too, she was really a ray of sunshine. Visually, this movie is so aesthetically pleasing, and it being a much older film now adds to that feeling. There are so many soft bright colors that it makes for a fun contrast with the darkness of the story and characters.

            "content": "I've heard about Harold and Maude from lots of friends. My wife's best friend swears by this film. We finally got around to renting it and although I really wanted to like it, I found it wearying. It's contrived. I kept trying to imagine what it was like to be a disaffected 20-something in 1971, thinking that the milieu of the times surely contributed to people's inclination to overlook the film's glaring faults and buy its rather forced situation. It wants to be dead-pan and over-the-top at the same time. It wants to be madcap and deadly serious. But it doesn't want to ever take the risk of holding up the two main characters to any kind of standard for three-dimensional behavior. Let's say we buy that Harold really is as morose and unhappy as his several faked suicide attempts indicate, are we ever shown any other reason other than that he has a reprehensible and insensitive parent? Are we even shown any other ways he has tried or failed to connect with others? Why should we care about this kid? What has he ever done for anyone other than a bunch of cruel pranks? And as for Maude, why the constant hypomania about \"living\" and \"life!\" -- all the feel good thoughts about \"trying new things\". If that is really true to character for her, why? And if the hints at a dark past are what she's playing off of, then why the decision to end her life rather arbitrarily? We get lots of Cat Stevens in the soundtrack to tell us how to feel when the characters can't. It's pretty paint by numbers in the emotional department. Essentially, it's fairly manipulative -- like any good melodrama -- the only difference being that this has a counter-culture theme running through it. Good for it. It's a shame it's so enamored of it's own ironic wit and cutesiness. The title characters get the \"likeable\" traits and the everyone else is there to make their lives seem interesting in comparison. We are given nothing of anyone's back story, nothing of their motivations. We're just supposed to think that they find each other fascinating and beautiful because no one else in the film is bearable.I'm not buying it. Almost from the get-go, I thought Ruth Gordon's kooky old lady routine was too cute to be true. The horrible driving and stealing of cars are supposed to make her funny and lovable but they just made me feel like I was watching cheap filmmaker ploys at character. There's barely a single line of dialogue that's memorable or clever. But, more to the point, it's the lack of internal conflict that makes the whole thing seem rather cheap.In the film's defense, I have to say I now wonder how much of the film felt clich\u00e9d and unoriginal because it's conceits had been copied so often by others. Perhaps the fascination with eccentrics that still plays out with every movie that has Shirley Maclean in it, and every other Johnny Depp movie owes a debt to this movie for paving the way. I wish I had seen it when I was younger and it was less dated. But, more than anything, I wish it had simply been better written. There's a beautiful sentiment bedded in the film, and I wish to take away from anyone's enjoyment of it.But you have to buy it in order to enjoy it -- and there were too many forced cute moments for me to buy it.",

This was very appropriate for the times, as a huge generational shift in consciousness became very powerful among the youth in the late 1960s and into the 1970s--most notably through the hippie and \"free-love\" movements.The soundtrack is just amazing and follows the movie to a \"T\". Cat Stevens dominates with a message so simple, yet so necessary for a culture filled with war and death during the Vietnam War.\"Well if you want to sing out, sing out. And if you want to be free be free. - Cat Stevens.The film's entire premise can be added up through a very simple set of dialogue in the film in which a police officer pulls over Maude and asks for her license....\"I don't have one, I don't believes in them.\" she replies. This film was given to us as message to challenge our own thinking patterns -- to think outside the box for lack of a better phrase. That seems so clich\u00e9 but it is so true. It pushes the boundaries of what is and isn't socially acceptable.It impacted not just my senses and exterior but I had a dramatic realization about freedom, love and personal perception that I really don't know much...like all of us. We all really don't know why or the what of our existence. The more I learn, the less I know as the famous saying goes.I highly recommend this piece of artwork--because that is exactly what it is. This is a masterpiece in film-making where the director has effectively touched the viewer-ship. Thats what it's all about. This film is a truly beautiful work that will stand the tests of time and be a constant reminder to us all to live life to the fullest and of the importance of true love.10/10",

When talking about the movie, you get to wonder what to mention first, but I guess it's basic theme of life and death gets to be the main talking point. It is a wonderful metaphor for a constant struggle young people face everywhere, every day. And the subject is so basic and every-daily that it is fascinating how fresh the movie is even to this day. But also, it is worth the praise - Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort perfectly embodied the opposing sides. Without their charisma and the vibe between them the movie would never be as good as it really is. And in the end, you get to see how a piece of music (the whole soundtrack is done by Cat Stevens) can mold the moods of this movie - the scene where Harold is driving by a huge cemetery with the piano playing is truly touching.It is not on my list of movies to watch before you die, it is one of my movies to watch so you can truly live.",

Good Will Hunting instantly comes to mind.Ruth Gordon did a fine job with her sweet charming personality. Harold however seemed just one-dimensional. I felt neither character was developed fully. Why was poor Harold the way he is? The question is never asked or answered. And you really do not sympathize with his character. But I think the biggest problem with the movie was the difficulty into believing that Harold could change from a negative to a positive view of life merely by falling in love with an 80 year old women. (Actually Harold looks even younger than the 20 portrayed in the film) And why did she decide to just end it all? This movie left me scratching my head more than a few times.Harold & Maude uses a lot of black comedy, but I found myself laughing just once or twice. Most of the humor really was out of place - Maude's stealing of cars, the excessive amount of fake suicide attempts, and (gasp) Harold & Maude in bed together. Another scene that I couldn't understand was Harold's interview with the military officer and then chasing Maude down the steps. Was that suppose to be a dream? I did like the camera work and editing. In particular, the opening scene, which was suspenseful and very well done. They did a good job tricking the viewer into believing the suicide and the mother who came home and her non-reaction to it.",

            "content": "I remembered this very well from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and reading about the plot it sounded like a suitable film to be featured, and definitely one I was up for for trying, from director Hal Ashby (Being There). Basically Harold Chasen (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Bud Cort) is a wealthy twenty year old young man living a very unusual existence, he likes to attend (gatecrash) funerals, watch building demolitions, visit junkyards, and he is obsessed with death, including simulating suicide attempts to get attention from his snobbish mother Mrs. Chasen (Vivian Pickles), and he sees a psychologist. It is at a funeral that his life starts changing when he meets equally eccentric and anarchic seventy nine year old Maude (Rosemary's Baby's Golden Globe nominated Ruth Gordon) who has the opposite attitude to life, she takes every life as it comes and gives him a new zest for life, as they have lots of small adventures and fun together. While Harold's mother is trying to find him a woman he will eventually marry, inviting some to the house and all being scared away by his committing fake suicides, Harold as he spends time with her is finding a close connection with Maude. After three attempts at finding Harold a wife, and trying to get him to join the army like his father did, he comes to the decision that he is in love with and will be happy with Maude, so as her eightieth birthday approaches he plans to propose marriage, and he tells his disturbed mother this too, and he ends up seeing more psychologists who advise him against it. On the night of Maude's birthday she is given a surprise party, and she says she can't think of a better farewell, as she reveals she has overdosed on sleeping pills, she states that her age is the appropriate time to die, but he rushes her to hospital. In the end Maude is treated, but the attempt to save her is unsuccessful and she dies, and the final sequence sees Harold supposedly driving his car fast over a seaside cliff and crashing on the beach, but we see that he calmly sitting on the cliff with his banjo, and he dances away. Also starring Cyril Cusack as Glaucus, Charles Tyner as Uncle Victor, Ellen Geer as Sunshine Dor\u00e9, Judy Engles as Candy Gulf, Shari Summers as Edith Phern, Mousehunt's Eric Christmas as Priest and Alien's Tom Skerritt as Motorcycle Officer. Cort is brilliant with his almost completely expressionless performance as the depressed young man given a new lease on life, and of course Gordon is lovable as the old free spirit who lives life to the fullest and proves you can find love at any age, also worth mentioning is Pickles as the wonderfully snobbish, bored and ignorant mother. The moments that made me laugh the most were the teenager and his wacky fake suicides, obviously there are plenty of funny dark moments as well, but there are also the tender moments between the young man and the elderly woman, all in all it adds up to a great black comedy drama. It was number 45 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!",

A few of my friends said they loved this film, simply, because they were were female and thought it would be cool to have an affair with a 20 year old guy when they were in their seventies.  This was not a good enough answer to me, but other friends liked it for better reasons, more to do with the psychology of the characters and why they are attracted to each other.I understand the appeal here.  The suicide humor felt a little bit too much like a writer begging for a laugh, and I did feel really bad for Harold going through such an emotionally devastating experience.  However, Maude's character is often hilarious, and Harold provides a lot of charisma in a \"Ghost World\" Enid-type way.  I guess the best thing that could be said about the relationship is that it is unconventional, and therefor provides a new perspective on just what love is.  My main problem with the film has always related to this as well, which is why a character as thoughtful and (secretly) good-natured would fall as Harold would fall into someone as self-serving as Maude.  Perhaps I can never get over this fact, but the second viewing provided me with more amusement than the first.  I think knowing how the story ended helped me \"live in the moment\", and enjoy the film's direction a whole lot more.I now feel this film can at least being considered as being close to the same level as Hal Ashby's other masterpieces, such as  \"The Last Detail\", \"Coming Home\", and, my favorite, \"Being There\".  There is a lot in this film to love, even though I'm not the biggest fan of the \"nature-of-true-love\" story that the film contains.

A blase, checked out, ultra rich young man meets a free spirited renegade granny and they fall in love. A charming premise, but the execution is underwhelming. The worst aspect for me was sitting through the scenes between Harold and his mother, who is a caricature of the pampered, domineering, self-absorbed distant type who almost never hears a thing Harold says. Every time the mother shows up it's the same thing... she walks in, reprimands Harold in a completely stilted manner, and then she walks off in a huff... or the film cuts away with her in a huff. It is SO unfunny. Then there are Harold's encounters with the one-armed uncle-general who is predictably uptight and only slightly more nuanced than the mother character. Again, these scenes are not nearly as amusing as they were intended to be.Compared to these encounters with his family, Harold's scenes with Maude are a relief to him -- and to the audience -- but not enough of a relief. Ruth Gordon gives it her all, but the script just doesn't give her enough support, and I found Bud Cort's performance to be uninspiring. Clocking in at just 90 minutes, the film still feels like it has significant padding and could be tightened up. Even the editing seems subpar, which is surprising since Hal Ashby, though directing here, had been an award-winning editor. I'd choose to see some of Ashby's other directorial credits again before I'd revisit Harold and Maude. For example, Being There is in another realm entirely -- a real work of genius compared to this title.Harold and Maude is a gentle, inoffensive picture that could have been much better than it actually is. There's no harm in seeing it -- just manage your expectations carefully.",

While the reference is correct, it's shameful how that is the major takeaway and remembered detail. There is much more to this story: two eccentric characters who are vibrant in their own ways and share that vibrancy as time passes; exploring identity through vulnerability; and romance that defines other's inability to understand. The soundtrack is perfectly curated and lends itself to the set pieces, from the decommissioned railroad car to the huge home that Harold's mom owns. Even situations outside of the wonderful friendship (and romance) that blooms between Harold and Maude is fun to watch: Harold's uncle with his armless salute, Harold's 'suicide' that results in an actor's dramatization, and substantial alterations of a Jaguar to be a hearse. I give Harold and Maude an 8/10.",

In the 70ies, Hollywood's audience could be surprised, shocked, made gasp and - most important- ponder over the films by very talented directors and brilliant cast. \"Harold and Maude\" is the most characteristic example.It makes us all think not so much of the weird (as some think) plot,twisted characters,but of simple and natural things without which we cannot live,i.e. love and understanding. Maude,a dinosaur by the measure of the younger people, happens to be much more \"alive\" than her teenage friend; more than that, she manages to breathe her vivacity into the withered soul of the boy,who lacks that sense of real companionship and mere attention from adults around him.Speak of the generation gap after that! True, they come to love each other, but this is not a romantic infatuation , but a deep-rooted friendship of soul-mates - a rare happening in our world, which is absolutely \"out of joint\".

            "content": "SPOILERS - This is Harold's story. He is 22, father is gone, mother is rich, he has no friends, has difficulty identifying with the material world. He drives a hearse, and attends funerals of people he didn't know. By his own admission he has tried to commit suicide 15 times. Not seriously, of course. Like the opening scene when he puts on a record, Cat Stevens' \"Don't Be Shy\", walks over to a stool, and hangs himself. His mother walks in, uses the phone, walks away. Over dinner Harold is hoarse, has a 'sore throat.' Another time he smears himself with fake blood and is in mom's shower as she finds him. Or he is floating face-down in the family pool as mom takes a swim. Mom decides it is time for him to get married, she signs him up for 'computer dating.'  One 'date', he sits at a side table, and while she is talking to him, he pulls out a large cleaver and hacks off his fake left arm. He is adrift in a strange ocean.Then at one of the funerals he meets Maude, a 79-year-old eccentric, non-conformist, who has no drivers license, no car of her own, but drives everywhere. She 'borrows' things from others, to 'remind them that stuff is here today, gone tomorrow.' Funny chase scene with a motorcycle cop, he finally gets her to stop, get out of the 'borrowed' car, and she and Harold take off on the motorcycle! Sometimes they have fun just by going down to the salvage yard and watch the operation.Mom gives Harold a new car, a Jaguar sportster. He takes a blowtorch, and presumably lots of other tools, and makes it look like a hearse sportscar! Harold announces to his mom that he is getting married, to Maude. Harold surprises Maude with a party for her 80th birthday. However, Maude says she has to be going soon -- she already took the pills. Rushed to the hospital, they try to save her but can't.  Harold weeps, drives his cars to the cliffs and sends it over, crashing to the beach below.  Then he takes out the banjo that Maude had given him, and dances up the hill, playing.So, just when he needed it most, this person, Maude, came into his life, gave him the understanding of appreciating what is around you, and for hoping for a better life. This is a comedy, with a somewhat dark ending. But a good story, and very well done. Bud Cort (22) as Harold and Ruth Gordon (74)were just right in these roles.",

            "content": "Harold and Maude is one of the original cult classics. A critical and box-office disappointment when released, it has in subsequent years become a classic, if unlikely, romantic comedy.Harold (Bud Cort), who appears to be in his late teens or early 20's, lives in a magnificent mansion with his mother and several servants. He's a quiet fellow, brow-beaten by his (comically) domineering mother, and has a fixation on death: his main pleasures come from attending the funerals of strangers (driving himself in his hearse) and from staging imaginative fake suicides to shock his mother.Harold notices that a woman in her 70's is also regularly attending funerals, and she introduces herself: Maude (Ruth Gordon, of Rosemary's Baby fame). Maude is a whirlwind of a woman, a genuine free-spirit--she enjoys stealing cars for joy-rides (and as a reminder to car-owners to not get attached to things), she poses nude for an artist, she plays multiple musical instruments, and her home is filled with interesting mementos, keepsakes, and art. Maude is also a font of wisdom--she is a holocaust survivor, she grew up in pre-World War I Vienna and danced at balls at the Palace, she freed animals from cages decades ahead of the animal liberation movement, and she protested and fought for the biggest issues. Maude's wisdom is supplemented by the score by Cat Stevens, who was at the height of his powers as a hippie-dippy mystic able to write profoundly catchy folk-rock songs.Meanwhile, Harold's mother (memorably played by Vivian Pickles), has decided that her son needs to take on adult responsibilities, so has arranged a series of dates for Harold through the services of a computer dating company. Harold, who is becoming smitten with Maude, decides to utilize his experience with fake suicides to horrify and drive away his arranged dates (none of these women are well-matched with Harold since his mother took it upon herself to fill out the application for the dating service). Harold's mother is so incensed that she concludes Harold should be drafted into the army, but Harold and Maude utilize their talents at deception to make that an impossibility.Harold and Maude become lovers, and Harold decides to propose marriage. As alluded to earlier in the film, Maude has other plans--on her 80th birthday, when Harold proposes, she tells him she's taken poison and will be dead by midnight. Apparently, long ago, perhaps in the Camps, she had taken a vow to end her life at 80 if she survived that long, and she kept that vow. Despite Harold's efforts--he calls for an ambulance, Maude is taken to a hospital--she is dead by dawn of the next day. Harold, utterly devastated, drives his customized Jaguar (it looks like a hearse--Harold altered the vehicle after his mother had his previous hearse hauled away) off a cliff. Or so it appears. Though the car goes crashing down, we see that Harold has saved himself--the film ends with him ambling down the road, tentatively playing \"If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\" on the banjo Maude gave him.Harold and Maude is genuinely hilarious and touching, and Harold's journey from death-obsessed boy to life-affirming man is only made possible because of Maude's profound influence. The irony of Maude's suicide is that she intensely loved life and lived it fully. While many will disagree with her decision to end her own life, no one can say that Maude did not fully embrace life until the very end.The look and sound and much of the content of the film's message was clearly influenced by Summer Of Love-style hippies, so the likelihood you'll be receptive to the film's message is increased if you are 420-friendly (wink), and if you like the music of the 60's and early 70's. It is also a particularly good movie for teenagers--this is a coming-of-age tale, and if you are still trying to figure out the world, or are feeling alienated and alone, then this movie's message can do genuine good. Harold's obsession with death is a clear precursor to Goth, so if you are somewhat gloomy, or are feeling somewhat depressed, Harold and Maude can be a sort of antidote.",

            "content": "Harold and Maude is a Seventies movie that is very controversial by topic; it was made right around the \"free love\" movement and is the story of a young boy, Harold, who believes he has no worth in the world; his mother means well but is an aristocratic snob at times and cares little of Harold's interests, only how he looks to her friends. He is obsessed with death and dying, considered corrupt and disturbing in society, his mother has tried to \"cure\" him of his love of death with a psychologist, a priest and his soldier uncle, none of whom care of his interests and emotions. At one of the many funerals he attends for enjoyment, he meets Maude, a life-loving antithesis of himself who soon becomes his best friend and confidant although they disagree on his love of death. She does help him however to escape the dates his mum sets up for him, by staging elaborate fake suicides such as lighting himself on fire, chopping off his own hand and Harri-Kiri. His dates, believing him to be really dead, always run off screaming. As the days go by he falls in love with Maude; despite himself being in his twenties and her in her seventies he learns from Maude that age, race, gender and interests shouldn't separate them. He finally breaks down and explains the reason for his love of death and dying, and Maude takes him on adventures, dodging a cop, outwitting his snobby mother and exploring derelict junkyards and oil refineries, as well as going for walks in a local greenhouse. She explains to him that he shouldn't be judged for liking death; despite it being different from the opinions of others it is his personality. He confesses his plans to marry Maude to his mother, who freaks out and tells Harold's doctor, priest and uncle, all who try to talk him out of it, but he loves her and proposes to her that very evening. To his shock she overdoses on sleeping pills so that she can \"die at what she feels is the proper age to go\", and he tries to save her, to no avail. She dies and rather than drive his hearse off a cliff with him in it like he planned, as a tribute to the life-loving Maude he leaps from the hearse at the last minute and stays alive as he watches the hearse explode.This is an amazing movie, for several reasons. First off, for pointing out that you can still be friends with those who disagree with your opinions, and that judgment based on hate is no way to view anyone.Secondly, for Maude's life story. In the play, which was published as a novel, Maude was a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust, and came to America still with a positive outlook on life and people.In case parents were wondering,the movie has gotten mixed emotions, mainly for Harold's fake suicides, some of which appear very violent and gory ways to go, and people considered it highly irregular to be on-screen. Also some people considered Maude a pedophile, for the age difference between Harold and herself. However, Harold is in his twenties, therefore if he gave consent to loving Maude, the idea of her being a pedophile would be false.This is a comedic yet strangely beautiful movie that anyone can relate to, I highly recommend it.",

The film oozes charm and humanity but is not without its shocks, from the very opening shots. He has a death wish and she a life wish, so whist he dramatises suicides to the complete disinterest of his mum, brilliantly played by Vivian Pickles, Maude encourages him to appreciate, flowers, the stars and running rings around the police - literally. Their initial mutual interest is attending funeral and this 20 something young innocent lad and the worldly wise and Buddhist inspired 79 year old get on increasingly well together.

Harold is a torpid and pasty boy possessed with death, he frequently plays suicide pranks at home so much so that his mother (Pickles) doesn't take it seriously at all, which is designed as a peculiar opening gambit sets the black comedy tone of the film directed by Hal Ashby (BEING THERE 1979, 8/10 and SHAMPOO 1975, 5/10).Both are enthusiastic funeral-crashers, Harold and Maude meet at someone else's funeral, as opposed by their sex and age, so is their personae, compared with the hearse-riding Harold, Maude is a live-in-the-moment embracer, living inside a disused trunk which she has transformed into a cozy and exotic harbor, she is an adroit car thief and a reckless driver, her devil-may-care spirits diffuse Harold's unwholesome disobedience towards the bourgeois hollowness, and she opens a new world for him, they enjoy olfactory memorabilia, rescue dying tree, open up to each other, and sex is well-hinted too. Decidedly uplifting vignettes are the three blind-dates organized by Harold's mother, during which Harold scare off his dates by self-immolation, cutting off his arm and hara-kiri respectively, the last one Sunshine Dor\u00e9 (Geer) is a dilettante actress, her histrionic improv of Romeo and Juliet strikes as a potential match for Harold's temperament. Another wacky scheme is pulled off by Harold and Maude together, to dissuade Harold's war hawk uncle (Tyner) from enrolling him in the army, a manifest derision in the face of militant blind-faith. Clearly, Maude is the savior of the young Harold with her insightful wisdom and attitude, however, for Maude herself, she is beyond any salvation, her covertly suggested background subtly indicates that it is a hard-earned privilege to decide when to leave solely on her own volition, it is determined long before she meets Harold, which is a bit pejorative towards senility because she is so energetic and life-loving, and for Christ's sake, she has just met her soul-mate! It would be wiser to inflict some ailment (e.g. dementia) on her to justify her self-serving resolution. Still, it is a wondrous comedy anchored by two outstanding performances, Bud Cort's man-child ambiguity is redolent with indelible marks as a spoiled child from the beat generation while Ruth Gordon unleashes her infectious vitality unremittingly, and the tricky part is their liaison never falls into self-consciousness or over-contrivance, i5 can smoothly strike viewers' emotional core near the end. It will be a vital remiss if I don't mention Cat Stevens' omnipresent soundtrack, a tuneful product of its time, but the theme song IF YOU WANT TO SING OUT, SING OUT is stressed at least three times, thus during the end credits, it sadly overkills.",

There are unsettling moments, as the premise itself of a love affair between a couple with a 60+ year age difference makes one kind of squeamish, as well as the gruesome fake suicides, but the worst moment for me was where Harold \"customizes\" his brand new Jaguar Sports Coupe until the hardtop resembles a tiny Hearse.  How dare he butcher such a fine a car! Unfortunately, I found the film rather ineffective, as either a comedy or as an unsettling piece that stayed with you (in that it really did not; after the shock value, I didn't care to think about any deeper meaning).

The secret is be yourself. We are all a small cosmos and be yourself. be happy. Be a bum, a puppet, a clown, an executive but don't be an a-hole or mean.",

            "content": "When death meets life, life becomes somewhat happy and sad at the same time.Harold is a teenage boy obsessed with death so much that he innovates new ways of dying and even shows them to his mom or his friends. He meets Maude, a 79 year old woman at one of the funerals and his life changes significantly that he starts hating death. Till the final act Hal Ashby held this up well, and then just when I started liking Harold, he gave up on him and made Harold a simple human like most others. \"Maude, please don't go\" Ah, I disliked this part of Harold and thats where this movie fell apart for me. It's a disgusting depiction of death and yet it is very interesting, coz we have rarely seen such a boy who is so much obsessed with death and rarely we have seen a teenage boy falling for a 80 year old woman. Ah, this is a love story of a completely different kind. On one side, his mother is setting up dates with young women and on the other side, he is liking this old woman who lives life to the fullest and does not seem to be giving up on life. When he decides to get her into his life by marrying, she reveals that the time is up and says 80 is the perfect age to die and thus guy weeps as if he never was even acquainted and what it feels like dying. Hmm, I would have liked this transition to be more on the slow side rather than a rushed up thing. The writing is good and so is the direction and even acting. Ruth Gordon as Maude and Bud Cort as Harold brought something fresh to their characters, you can name that innocence or amateurishness, but it was refreshing. Hal Ashby the director who is now considered great did a good job in trying to portray two different attitudes of life and death and marry them in emotions by making the dead learn about life. It would have been a beautiful marriage of course, but what I did not like only is that our protagonist Harold changes what he thrived on his own life. Technically, I wish the production values, the cinematography were better than shown and all else seems to be right. I liked the sound design though specially for the death scenes. I am going with 3/5 for a good film that makes two poles meet and engages them in a relationship.",

The story follows their friendship, which slowly blossoms to romance.The film, directed by Hal Ashby, could be called the strangest romantic comedy of all time. The romance is at sometimes cringe inducing, but sweet at the same time. The comedy is satire, of the highest order. The laughs come uneasily, as we're not sure we should be laughing. The film manages to balance the thine line of satire. It does it's job well, not becoming to slapstick, or too dramatic. That said the performances by Bud Cort, Ruth Gordon and Vivian Pickles are above excellent. Gordon gives perhaps her best performance. Cort manages to turn his character into something that I've never seen before. It's a brilliantly done performance.That said, the only thing holding me back from giving Harold and Maude 10 stars, are the cringe inducing love scenes and the music. The songs by Cat Stevens are simple, but after I while I got tired of them. Harold and Maude is a quirky film. For those who expect formulaic romantic comedy, this is not for you.

            "content": "Not many films, if any, are able to effectively portray a relationship between a teenager and an 80 year old woman in a believable and endearing way; Harold and Maude is one such exception. In this fascinating and most unusual screenplay from the writer of the feminist fun-house Nine to Five, Colin Higgins tells the story of young Harold (Bud Cort), a depressed existentialist who's only passion seems to be staging his own death and attending funerals. Ironically, Harold comes across his polar opposite, the kind and generous Maude (Ruth Gordon), a woman whom values life to a great degree. The two form a strong platonic friendship at these funerals eventually leading to intercourse and a proposed marriage of the unlikely pair.Hal Ashby does a fine job of making such an unlikely and morbid character, Harold, someone whom is in turn, actually quite likable. This is done through the displays of the cruel and sometimes detestable world around Harold justifying how he has become so detached from society, especially through his abusive and wealthy family. Bud Cort captures this character in an emotionally gripping way by somehow appearing to be the most content miserable person on the face of the earth. Harold and Maude rarely seems to fall flat other than when its bizarre surrealism begins to leave the realms of dry humor and approach more of an obvious and slapstick approach seen in many of the farcical suicide attempts. Cat Steven's soundtrack is a gripping and essential compliment to the film as one would recognize Simon and Garfunkel alongside The Graduate. This is definitely an \"experience-film,\" to say that you will leave your viewing of Harold and Maude with a unique presence that can only be given by a film such as this; it has a very distinct style and makes sure to exploit this throughout its every turn.",

            "review_title": "Genuine discomfort",
            "content": "I guess I can understand why 'Harold and Maude' has become a cult classic -- its love story is defiant of convention and the movie celebrates and romanticizes society's outsiders. While it's an innocent enough film, I suppose, or maybe simply a na\u00efve film, I can't think of many other movies that have made me feel such genuine discomfort.The problem is not that 20-year old Harold falls in love with 79-year old Maude. The problem is that Maude is not sexy, not endearing, and not real. Harold may have been written as an asexual, but I somehow doubt that screenwriter Colin Higgins (whose career has not been an impressive one, having since yielded movies like '9 to 5' and 'Silver Streak') considered that. Harold has no interest in girls his own age and thwarts each of his mother's matchmaking attempts with grotesquely faked suicides.Harold, as played by Bud Cort, is nevertheless the only character in the film who takes on the dimensions of an actual human being. Everyone else is written as a caricature, and that's one of the film's major flaws. Harold's mother, for instance, is an obnoxious, classist heiress who asks her son questions and then answers on his behalf. The character is written in one key and is played in one key by Vivian Pickles. The filmmakers' attitude toward this character is so obvious that by simply placing poor Harold as her son, in her company, a certain angelic aura is given to him in contrast. Harold is laconic and glum, wears mourner's attire and drives a hearse, and his economy of verbal expression elicits the viewer's sympathy almost by default, since every other character in the film may as well be using a megaphone.Then there's Maude. Ruth Gordon is a fine actress, and it's heartwarming to see a woman of her age exhibit as much verve and energy as she does here. But her character of Maude is yet another caricature, and her every line drips with saccharine forever-young sunniness that sounds like flower-child parody. She brings some joy, some sunshine, into Harold's life, and some excitement; it's supposed to be ironic and funny when Maude steals a car and speeds away from the police.The movie is entirely too precious about Harold, about Maude, and about Harold and Maude. Even Harold's suicide forgeries are framed with a glow of Gothic tragedy, which just prevents them from being funny (although one prank, where Harold pretends to chop off a hand in order to scare off another arranged date, is funny). Making matters worse is the musical score by Cat Stevens, which is now painfully dated and sugar-coats whatever remaining black comedy could have been salvaged from this material. All of these touches are intended to make the film feel-good and liberating, I would presume, but it's ultimately just depressing and made me feel pretty queasy.Watching this movie, nothing about it screams 'classic.' It looks like it should have remained some forgotten and embarrassing relic of the early '70s.",

            "content": "In life, people are often faced with circumstances that can leave them changed, or lead to eccentric behavior. This is the case of Harold (Bud Cort) in the film, `Harold and Maude.' Known as a cult classic, `Harold and Maude' is a film that transcends its time with a daring love story between a young man between the ages of 18-20 and an elderly woman nearing the age of 80. The film is reminiscent of the story of `Auntie Mame' in that despite its dark comic approach, `Harold and Maude' is in fact a celebration of life and the eccentricities that make every person unique. \tThe story follows that of young Harold (Cort), a rich teen who constantly fakes suicide perhaps to gather attention from his mother, a shallow socialite who has no comprehension of her son's afflictions. One of Harold's favorite past times is to attend funerals, where in fact he meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), an elderly woman whose peculiar behavior leads her to steal cars, among other things, and to appreciate life beyond what the average person does. The two meet at a wake and become close friends. Maude teaches Harold the importance of life beyond the norms by seeing the beauty and intrigue that exists and every object that inhabits this earth. The two generate a connection that ultimately leads to love, and makes Harold question his own wants in life with a family and society that are too conventional for his tastes. \t `Harold and Maude' isn't just a love story; it's a dark comedy. One can't help but laugh how Harold's phony suicides are portrayed. From stringing himself up in a noose to pretending to chop his arm off, Harold thinks of anything that will shock and disturb his mother. But to his chagrin, nothing works. What's more, the actions of the unusual Maude of stealing cars and fooling police officers, it will leave anyone giggling.  \tAside from its whimsical nature, `Harold and Maude' is relatively bleak as it deals with issues such as death and suicide. Similar issues were raised by a recent theatrical release, `The Hours,' which followed the story of three different women, in three different time periods who were all profoundly affected by Virginia Woolf's novel, `Mrs. Dalloway.' In one scene of `The Hours,' Woolf's husband asks her why someone has to die in her book. Her answer, `Someone should die in order that the rest of us appreciate life.' That's basically the message that one receives from `Harold and Maude,' as well. Death is a part of life although upsetting and sometimes unfair, it happens. Ergo, perhaps people should gain a greater appreciation for their own life when someone close to them dies. \tAll in all, `Harold and Maude' is a delightful treasure among other films in the romantic comedy genre. It's begs the question of love existing between two very different people who have so much in common that to avoid love would be a mistake. The film is available for rental at local video stores and for purchase. ***1/2",

The old lady more or less adopts the young man, who soon falls in love with her. That's the frame of the story and the humor comes mainly from the incidents that occur in the relationship, although in early scenes Harold's fake suicides are the principal diversion, along with the peremptory behavior of his mother (Vivian Pickles) who treats Harold like a child -- understandably since he acts like one even if he is old enough to be an adult. Later on, the movie features Maude's theft of any automobile that's handy to take her where she wants to go, driving like a maniac. Stopped by a police motorcycle officer, she soon drives off in his motorcycle with Harold in the sidecar. In truth, my wife and I soon tired of both the high- jinx and the premise of \"Harold and Maude,\" but loved watching Gordon.

Besides, the way to describe Maude not only as a mysterious, experienced, knowing-everything elder but also as a vivid, ordinary, lovable individual from youngsters' point of view has distinguished the film from any other, having subconsciously tickled young males' Oedipal Complex.

Despite their differences, their relationship always felt believable and heartfelt.It is wonderful to watch Maude teaching Harold what living a joyous life means.The performances of Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are definitely outstanding and their chemistry is great. Harold's mother, played by Vivian Pickles, is probably my favourite character. Every scene she is in is perfect and her interactions with her son are priceless.The attention to detail in this movie is incredible. Especially the makeup department and the costume designer have done a great job. The cinematography is very beautiful and the film has some of the most gorgeous shots I have ever seen (e.g. Harold and Maude watching the sunset).The soundtrack by Cat Stevens is fantastic and used in a very effective way.I believe Harold and Maude has aged well because the pacing is much faster than in other movies from the seventies. In addition, there is probably the wittiest fourth wall break in the history of cinema.Harold and Maude is a very emotional movie. It ranges from heartbreaking to hilarious and combines comedy, romance and drama in a beautiful and very unique way.",

I can't really say much more than that.Well, Harold does try to kill himself regularly (to plentiful gore but little effect) and Maude drives strangers cars off without a second thought, so I guess there's that. There's also a moral about 'make the most of your life', though it kind of gets lost underneath all the strangeness.There are many scenes where the characters behaviour completely transcend 'normality', a somewhat grating Cat Stevens soundtrack, black comedy galore and a surprisingly touching ending. A patchy film in terms of how it held my interest, but definitely one I'm glad I saw.Some people apparently like it a heck of a lot more though, so maybe I'm missing something. Oh well. 6/10",

Despite my familiarity with the era and experience predicting where plot lines would lead the final scenes were not what I expected. And the one, quick, simple, un-glorified shot that explained a lifetime of behavior was nothing less than brilliant.Well worth the wait - and an hour and a half of your time - if you enjoy films that were refreshing in their era and continue to challenge the Hollywood norm.",

On the other hand, it deserves a 1 for ickiness and its trite expressions of \"live life\" philosophy.As the end of the movie approached, I felt inclined to give it an 8, but I changed my rating to a 6 and a \"thumbs down\" because of the ending.My review includes spoilers as I explain my logic. Here's my problem with the movie \u0096 Maude's suicide contradicts the entire point of everything that happened earlier!!! If she died via a car accident or stroke or if she revealed a terminal illness, I would have given the movie an 8.The writers exhibit thinking that infuriates me. They do NOT understand the difference between personality and character. I see this on the news whenever there is a murder and neighbors say the suspect is a \"nice guy\" because he starts conversations with them, smiles, and is friendly.In fact, the suspect has a nice personality and the neighbors generally know little about his character. The same is true here. Maude appears happy and nice because she is extroverted. In fact, the movie's conclusion reveals she is unbelievably selfish and/or depressed.She is very healthy so there is no reason to kill herself. The writers foreshadow Maude's suicide because she implies she will kill herself early in the movie. \"It's all going to be over after Saturday,\" she says, a line I forgot about until the end. Yet, for most of the rest of the plot she befriends Harold, goes out with him, and responds in kind to his \"I love you\" remarks.In short, Maude is a bad person \u0096 not the lover of life who inspires Harold.I will NEVER accept the premise that dancing, as Harold does at the end, means a person changed. This was also a flaw in \"Zorba The Greek\" when the Brit acts like a wimp as his girlfriend is killed by a mob and the house of Zorba's wife is ransacked. Yet, I'm supposed to believe he changed because he danced. He was MORE wimpy at the end of the movie than he was at the start.If Harold has a brain, his experience with Maude will make him MORE negative about life.It's difficult to give a 6 to a movie I gave a \"thumbs down,\" but I loved the eccentric supporting characters, the audacity of Maude's teenlike rowdiness, Harold's fake suicides, the non-dates with young women, and the character conflicts, especially the Harold-Mom relationship.I watched the movie a second time to see if Harold ever talked to his mother before he briefly told her near the end that he was marrying Maude. The Mom spoke dozens, maybe hundreds, of lines to Harold. The son's only response was \"I have a sore throat\" \u0096 a line he delivered in front of several people. He NEVER responded to his Mom in one-on-one encounters.The \"Graduate On Steroids\" was enjoyable, but failed because its creators do NOT understand that personality does NOT equal character.ZWrite",

A much older woman and a young man falling in love makes for an interesting premise, but it also seems it would be quite difficult to pull of well. Harold and Maude did it perfectly. It helped that it wasn't just about their love but also a character study: how Harold was obsessed with death and pretended to kill himself in the opening scene in the movie, or how they meet at a funeral. It is a morbid humor, but funny none the less. I watched it with my friend, who says it is her favorite movie, and by the end we were both sobbing. The fact that they were such an oddball couple isn't even the whole reason: the simple beauty of it, the tenderness in which the subject is approached, and how at the end it is sad yet you also feel a sense of happiness for the love they shared. When Maude tells Harold that she is going to die, the way the scene is played out will leave you in tears for the rest of the movie. At the very end when Harold stands on the cliff, watching the car burst into flames, playing the banjo, even the most unfeeling, cold person will simply lose it. This is a masterpiece, funny, sad, tender, and interesting all at the same time, which are rare to come across.",

Where the movie claims to be about growth, it is really about shutting down.Harold is shown as being totally justified in closing off the world -- the world is black and white, with Harold's Mother being totally, irredeemably wrong and Maude being totally, irredeemably right.  Harold's world isn't wrong because it's smug, closed-minded, or simple -- it's wrong because it exhibits the wrong kind of smugness, close mindedness, and simplicity.Harold and Maude maintains this grim, relentless march toward \"Meaning\" \"Enlightenment\" \"Life\" with barely a glimpse of true humor -- viewing it is as much a cultural artifact as would be a 2 hour film of Yakoff Smirnoff performing his standup act before a Republican crowd in 1987.\"Slouching Toward Bethlehem\" by Joan Didion is a perfect counterpoint to Harold and Maude -- read it after you see this movie for a return to sanity.",

The story centers around Harold (Bud Curt), a lonely and depressed teenager obsessed with staging fake suicides. In his spare time, he gets his kicks out of attending funerals, to people he has never seen or met. He befriends another frequent funeral attendee, Maude (Ruth Gordon), nearly his total opposite, an older woman who wants to get the most out of life.The script here is great. Taking somewhat of a lubricious subject matter, and making it completely believable. Ashby, the film's director, should also be credited, as the film is very vibrant and full of life. But, mostly, the film is carried by Curt and Gordon, who play off one another to nearly perfection. Their relationship never comes off as simplistic, as these actors add another layer to make it an even deeper and more fulfilling experience.The film's end, without giving it away, left me very disappointed. It's totally predictable, only to serve as melodrama and get an emotional reaction out of the audience. It really left a sour taste in my mouth when the film does wrap up, after the first hour and twenty-five minutes are very solid, then the last five minutes totally veers off the track.That aside, 'Harold and Maude' is an extremely charming film that holds up to is cult following.

For me, much of the movie is like watching a ghost story.The whole film is something of a time capsule.  The charming music, the outrageous fashion, and the Maude character seem like things that could only have happened in that time and place.  If a character like Maude existed today, she'd probably be on reality TV being pelted with offal or something.The humor of H&M is wicked and mannered.  I'm not sure people take the film as the class-conscious statement it must have been at the time, since these days even the poorest people in comedies seem to be living in vast apartments and driving new cars.  (That is one thing I really loved about H&M - the total absence of that weird feeling I have more and more with comedies that every last thing on the set just came off the rack, out of the wrapper and was positioned just so for a product placement.  It's like watching people act in the middle of Target.)Much of the film's message was kinda lost on me.  The portrayal of a rich kid vaguely probing for something to care about seemed interesting to me chiefly in the context of the 70's counterculture rather than anything emotionally involving.  The opposition between Harold's mom and Maude is between a force that wants to integrate Harold into a ridiculous society of status-obsessed dopes and a `follow your bliss' approach.  That underlying story became the plot of quite a lot of disposable 80's comedies, which is probably why people are sick of it.I just didn't get Maude, though I admit that could have something to do with the limits of my imagination and experience.  (I'm a Kubrick/Lang/Sternberg fan, so it could be said that I just like art to be a little more sterile and people-free than H&M).  It's a unique film that I found quite beautiful in spots and often hilarious.  I dunno if I'd recommend it to very many people though.  It's a pretty rarified/accidental/cult pleasure.",

While nobody saw fit to chew me out for this oversight, I decided to make my maiden contribution with \"Harold and Maude.\" Why? Because of the thousands of films I have watched, none has resonated with me more. I saw it the first time shortly after its 1971 release and was flabbergasted from its opening scene. Soon I found myself immersed in a surreal world that was at once the most subversive and compassionate thing my ten-year-old self had seen. I fell head-over-heels in love with Maude and I suppose with Harold, too. Certainly, each left their mark on my own personality and priorities. Unfortunately, some critics at the time really raked the film over, calling it \"debased\" and \"morbid,\" and doubtlessly hurting its box office. That these grown men failed to recognize it as the life-affirming film it was made me realize that sometimes kids can see things that adults can't. Or won't. Admittedly, I don't know that the film merits ten stars in a more objective vein. But in my subjective view it warrants a hundred. It has everything that I always wanted in a film but all too rarely encountered given my subsidy of the medium. Blessed with a script that was tight, funny, and sad, it then went one better by having the good sense to have itself directed by Hal Ashby whose uncanny ability to marry images with music anticipated the advent of MTV a decade later (for additional evidence, see his films \"Shampoo\" and \"Coming Home.\" Richard Sarafian did give Ashby a run for his money with \"Vanishing Point\"). Admittedly, it takes a certain sensibility to fully appreciate this film. But it's the kind of sensibility I like. If only there were more Harold and Maude's out there.",

That is, they think of the most unlikely things they can think of co-existing together, and then say to themselves, \"What if x, and then y, and then z happened? What would happen then? How could I tell that story?\" And that is what it seems happened here. What if you took a cloistered, depressed, suicidal 20-year-old male who believes that he has nothing to look forward to in life, nothing to live for, and then hooked him up with a 79 year-old woman, a woman full of vim and vinegar and zest for life, and who shows him how to live? And what if theirs then ends up as a romantic --sexual-- relationship? What are the various ironies and paradoxes and oddities that could be explored? What kinds of things could that story tell us? Where would these people end up in the end?I saw this movie back in 1971 when it came out, and found it quite funny.But, I gotta say, I thought then that the idea of a sexual relationship between a 20-year-old male and a 79-year-old woman was very strange, even borderline sicko, and now, 34 years later, I still do. I know that's a big part of the point (i.e., exploring the unusualness of that mating), but, sorry, I can't get past it. It becomes a negative.6/10 for humor",

The characters and their development was rather endearing, I found myself accepting of a romantic relationship that would normally make me ill, and as it ended, I was in tears.  I was highly moved by the story and intrigued by it's depth.  It is apparent that Maude enbodies many Buddhist philosophies and Harold represents the search for meaning in our lives we all face in different ways.  To truly appreciate this movie, you must view it several times to catch all the depth and subtle messages it holds.  Kat Stevens' songs also are filled with deep meaning and intertwine Maude's outlook and approach in life.  The movie and lyrics succeed not only to amuse and touch our hearts, but also to help us think in a different way and approach life with arms open.  I highly recommend that you see this if you haven't.  It is known as a cult classic, but should be remembered as so much more.  If anything,  this movie is not given the credit it deserves to be remembered as one of the best written, casted, and acted motion pictures of our time.  Out of 5 stars, I'd give it 5.",

It's all surface, telling its viewers what to believe rather than trusting them to make up their own minds.Contrast it to a similarly named movie from the same era, Harry and Tonto. Where Harold and Maude marches headlong like the soldiers it mocks, Harry and Tonto wanders along, digressing here and there.  Where Harold and Maude brooks no uncertainty, painting the world in black and white, Harry and Tonto shrugs its shoulders.Harold and Maude is supposed to be about the value of LIFE, but it brays that the vastness of the living world is doltish, empty, and fit only for mockery.  Harry and Tonto suggests that life has its ups and downs, you do what you can, and maybe things won't be half bad.  In Harold and Maude, LIFE is a secret thing that only a few can know; in Harry and Tonto, life is everything, everywhere, and we're all in it together.Harry and Tonto certainly isn't a perfect movie, nor is it the only one which you could contrast to the sneering face of Harold and Maude.  Shop Around the Corner, Our Town, Cool Hand Luke, To Kill a Mockingbird, Local Hero, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Babette's Feast, the list goes on, all movies which focus on humanity in a way which Harold and Maude wants to claim as its own, secret corner of the world.",

She has lived a meaningful life and continues to do so. It is their juxtaposition that is crux of this movie.Maude is actually an unusual MPDG, manic pixie dream girl. A character mostly female who teaches the male protagonist how to live life to its fullest. It is unusual because MPDGs are mostly young and their male counterparts mostly doing jobs. Here we have a old MPDG showing the joy of life to a young guy.There is the ick factor too considering the romance between the two and a scene of them together in bed, but you forget that. What remains is a beautiful movie.",

That's where he encounters the eccentric \"Maude\" (Ruth Gordon) who also has a penchant for the ceremonies - and for also pinching a car from the cemetery for a bit of a joyride afterwards. As his mother increases her activities in finding him a love match, \"Harold\" finds himself and his new friend spending more and more time together and he begins to learn that her live today policy is vibrant, exhilarating and contagious! Their bond grows ever stronger as the pair begin to rely more and more on each other, even to fall in love! There's a great dynamic between Cort and Gordon here. She brings out the best in her young acting companion with confident and engaging performances from both delivering a story that is funny, poignant and surreal - in almost equal measure. At times it's a touch on the wordy side, but Pickles is fun as the mother and the whole story is one of interesting characters and truth. It is short and sweet and right from the start we never get to hang around long before the pace picks up again. Great fun.",

            "content": "Megan Gile Media 5/18/10 Review of Harold & MaudeHarold & Maude a 1971 movie takes place in the San Francisco Bay area written by Colin Higgins and directed by Hal Ashby this is a story of Harold played by Bud Cort who is a dark person who is always thinking about death to get attention from his mother. In the first scene you see a man walking in an old house with happy music playing then out of no where Harold has hung himself. The majority of the music in this film is by Cat Stevens. There are many scene's like these where there is happy music while Harold is \"dying\" you think he is dead, but in reality it's a cry for help. Maude played by Ruth Gordon is a free spirited, live life to the fullest sort of person who is 79 years old and when these to meet up it turns into a unlikely romance that won't be forgotten. The movie itself is a terrific story that shows that no matter what age you can still love life and have great friendships. In the movie Harold is determined to get his mothers attention even if that means committing a fake suicide. He does everything to get his mother's attention but it just won't seem to work. Harold's dark, suicidal side slowly starts to disintegrate when Maude comes into his life when they meet at a funeral, which is one of Harold's hobbies. Maude brings the best out in Harold and soon he seems as though he enjoys life somewhat, many of the scenes take place in Maude's home which is full of quirky gadgets. The theme of this movie would have to be friendship and love. These two people who you would never think to be friends a young man in his early 20's and an a 79 year old woman who thinks you shouldn't live past 80, these two become the best of friends and at the end of the movie you clearly see they are more than just friends. The scenes in this movie are somewhat dark and mysterious when Harold was around; Maude brought the \"light\" to the movie so to speak, whenever she would come into the room she would brighten the mood with her \"borrowing\" random cars and replanting tree's. Maude makes Harold feel as though he was important to someone and he shouldn't live life being mad. Harold always had this gloominess to him; he always had a pale face and dark circles under his eyes and thought about death all the time. Maude wore quirky outfits and lived life to the fullest. Both Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon did a fantastic job in the acting department. I don't think I could see anyone else playing Maude or Harold for that matter, the two together made the movie and they both did a great job.The importance of this film is that no matter what age you are you can always have fun and fall in love. Harold & Maude is a movie that I recommend watching, it's a touching story of two unlikely people who fall in love and the obstacles they overcome. This movie portrays that true love does exist and no matter what there is always a person like you in some way who will always be there for you. Harold & Maude is a terrific movie that you will love and want to watch over and over again, it's a love story that no one will believe unless you watch it.",

            "content": "Hal Ashby's Harold and Maude is probably one of the strangest romantic comedies that was ever made, and indeed the term romantic comedy seems to be inappropriate to describe this film. To begin with, it has two protagonists that couldn't be more different - and I'm not only talking about the age difference of almost 60 years. Harold is a 20 year old, introverted, neurotic boy who suffers from a dominant mother and drives around in a hearse. His favorite hobby is faking his own suicide, something he did already roughly 15 times (at least that's what he's telling to his psychiatrist; we see six staged suicides (including drowning and self-incineration) and as a bonus one scene when he pretends to chop of his hand. Maude, on the other hand, is an extroverted lady just days before her 80th birthday who still tries something new each days - we see her singing songs by Cat Stevens, posing to nude to a painter and many things more, but her favorite hobby is stealing cars, something she's quite good at - especially if you consider she doesn't even have a license. But there's one hobby they share: They both frequently go to funerals. While Harold is wearing a trenchcoat and sunglasses, Maude is the one with bright dress and the yellow umbrella. When Maude one day offers Harold to drive him home (in his hearse she just stole), the are becoming friends. Maude teaches him to enjoy life (her lessons consist of playing banjo, dancing, smoking weed, saving a tree or stealing a police motorcycle), and meanwhile Harold begins to fall in love with her. She also helps him to escape military school in scene so funny it is worth the price of rental alone.But the film also shows Harold's (non-)relationship to his bourgeois mother and his militarist uncle (a very farcical parody of a right-wing conservative). His mother is rather indifferent towards her son (something which is shown best during his various 'suicides'), and she's almost completely unemotional to him. After she decides that Harold should marry, she fills in the questionnaire that she ordered from the marriage bureau herself, not caring whether her son agrees with the statements - or whether he wants to find a wife at all. After Harold tells her he's in love with Maude, she has him take counsel, and the photos on the wall demonstrate what institutions she believes in: president Nixon, Sigmund Freud and the pope (the scene with the catholic priest is only one minute long but one of the funniest parodies of the catholic church I've ever seen).The film is a masterpiece of character development and of secretly hidden hints to understand the characters (consider a scene where the observant viewer becomes aware of the fact that Maude is holocaust survivor). It is also a film of terrific acting. Ruth Gordon's Maude is one of the most memorable, most lovable and most unique characters in film history, Vivian Pickles is wonderful as Harold's mother, and if Robert Altman hadn't recommended to Bud Cort to turn down that offer to star in that film named One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, where would he be now?There's another reason why the term romantic comedy seems inappropriate: its ending. I won't reveal it to those who haven't watched this wonderful film yet, but I assure you it isn't your average 'And they lived happily ever after'-endings. It is a more or less open end, an optimistic end, maybe even a happy end, but one that you'll never find in your Sandra Bullock or Julia Roberts loves Hugh Grant or Ben Affleck films.",

            "content": "Harold and Maude rates highly in any film connoisseur's list as, perhaps, the black comedy of all time. The film was released in 1971 and has a superb cast, lead by Ruth Gordon (who won and Oscar for her role in Rosemary's Baby in 1968) as the 79-year-old Maude, and Bud Cort (Romero in Coyote Ugly) as the 20-year-old Harold.Harold is a rich kid, who craves attention from his mother, but only gets it when he fakes his own suicide. Discovering the power of death, his curiosity takes him to the funeral of someone he doesn't know. His fascination leads him to more funerals, where he sees Maude and realises that she, too, is an uninvited guest.Harold doesn't have much of a life; he has left school, but doesn't know what to do with his future. His mother lives in a social whirl and isn't very interested in him \u0096 apart from her aim to find him a wife and get him off her hands.Maude is a dear old lady, with real vitality and a zest for life; she wants to cram in as much as she can before the Grim Reaper knocks on her door! From the day they meet, Harold and Maude become inseparable. She has so much to teach him about life, and he has so much to learn.On his journey of self-knowledge, Maude helps him as no person ever has done before. The film has some excellent humour and comedy lines, bordering on slapstick that hit the nail on the head every time.As the relationship between these two eccentric souls strengthens, Harold's personality and self-respect grows, whilst his mother, even more worried by his affection for an old lady, goes to all lengths to save him \u0096 even buying him an E-Type Jaguar (which he converts into an E-Type hearse).This black comedy is not all black. It has a certain feel-good factor about it and it is incredibly funny. There are elements of suspense, romance and intrigue, as well as a large portion of satire.The opening sequence will make you wonder if you really want to watch the rest of the film, but after the first few minutes you will not feel so uncomfortable and will be gripped by the storyline that will not release you until the credits come up at the end. And what an end it is!Ironically, the soundtrack music is by Cat Stevens; surprisingly, it doesn't feel out of place, and it helps to bring the 70's ambiance to the screen.There are so few films around these days that do not insult your intelligence, if you get a chance to see Harold and Maude you really should. And if you can, take a very close friend so that you are both guaranteed a shoulder to cry on.",

The movie and its characters can only be described as \"funky,\" but in a very natural and entirely unself-conscious way.

It is a very personal, enlightening journey (albeit hysterical, as well) thanks to the guidance of Maude (Ruth Gordon- absolutely brilliantly cast), a 79 year-old with a pension for trying \"something new each day\". The world could due to take a page or two from Maude's book- her advice, ranging from the cure to individual sorrow to religion, is without peer.\nThe screenplay is so wickedly well done, and the directing is so perfectly suited to the material, that oftentimes, the actor's facial expressions carry whole conversations. (Bud Cort, case in point- especially the \"Mona Lisa smile\" after his faked immolation).The movie is life-affirming without whacking you over the head with ideals and morals. There's something to be said for subtlety in the ideas a movie is trying to express-Harold and Maude makes it look effortless.

Did it ever occur to anyone that by helping Harold realize what life has to offer, that he might go on to help others and fight for worthwhile causes, like Maude herself did? Also, I think the criticism of flashing Maude's concentration camp number is misguided at best. I'm reminded of Martin Scorcese relating how his experiences in Little Italy shaped him. Her concentration camp experience obviously shaped her, but if they had been the only experiences that shaped her, this movie probably would have been a lot more like Rod Steiger in \"The Pawnbroker\" So just enjoy the wit and wisdom that Maude imparts on her short journey with Harold.",

If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Harold and Maude revolve around... well, Harold and Maude. Harold's background has rendered him pretty lifeless, and it is not until the second part of the movie where his character starts to take off. Due to this, the beginning of the movie can feel a bit stale, but be patient.The music is typical for the 60s and 70s, which some acoustic songs playing every now and then. They are somewhat prevalent, which will be either a nuisance or a refreshment based on one's attitude towards that particular genre.Perhaps the most important fact to know beforehand is that this movie can come across as very disturbing. Harold frequently stages his own death in a multiple of ways, and although meant for comedy, they can be frightening for those who are more sensitive. The suicides take form through hanging, neck slicing (although off screen), drowning, setting himself on fire, and suicide by handgun as well as by knife.Harold and Maude also features a brief sexual relationship between two characters of very different age. Nothing is shown, only implied, but this could potentially come across as disturbing as well. If one manages to look through and appreciate these details, however, Harold and Maude is a fine comedy with both laughs and poignant questions.My personal grade: a slowly ascending 6/10.

Even though he seems to have been born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he's lost. He's emotionally, isolated, and he deals with these feelings by separating himself further - by constantly pushing his mother's 'buttons' as she (vainly tries to introduce Harold to several young women.Harold's mother, played marvellous straight-faced by Vivian Pickles sits Harold down one day, and says to him that it's time for him to grow up. But, like most young people, Harold has to find his own way, and on that path he meets someone who does help him grow; Maude (in a performance that fits Ruth Gordon like a second-skin).Maude is all that Harold NEEDS to be. Needs to feel.With Maude as his 'teacher,' Harold has the best friend - and first love he could ever have dreamed.As the film progresses, Harold lightens up - both figuratively and literally.I can't give away the end, though, in a way, it - like life, is inevitable. But, through it, Harold is able to grow up - and learn lessons of life, love, and maturing into one's own skin.Harold Ashby makes one of the most epoch-defining (and pushing) pictures of the 1970's, with a terrific soundtrack featuring Cat Stevens, who was just beginning to emerge as a huge star of the 70's .I can't stop hearing 'IF you want to sing out, sing out' as I write this.Even though I'm older - and, hopefully wiser, this film is, if anything more life affirming to me, as someone who has lived, as it show how valuable relationships and life are - no matter what someone's age.I still would love to have a friend like Maude.",

Maude senses life to its fullest while having few means, ignores social norms, and is obsessed with death because of her age (79).

The simplicity and faithfulness of their interaction is accentuated by the visually tacit character of Cat Stevens' music.It appears that this film has been influential, both in its use of music and its style.

            "content": "It was very nearly a 6/10, but then I realized how unique or special the movie was. Somehow it manages to convince us that an 80 year old woman and a 19 year old boy, falling in love is natural and normal. The two lead actors do a wonderful job of showing us the possibility. The film is flawed, of course, in the way many new Hollywood films of the early seventies are flawed, but ultimately it is an uplifting story, humorous and memorable. And most importantly it's still fairly entertaining. The ending is a bit perplexing, but you should be satisfied.",

            "content": "Just finished watching Harold and Maude by Hal Ashby and this was a big surprise for me cause movies at that tim weren't so bold like this one, specially when it comes to humor...This film is about a boy and an old lady and they both live their lives as if it was their last, only that Harold (the boy) doesn't really care about his life and Maude (the old lady) really tryes to make the best out of every moment.These are two really good and odd characters that also make a good and odd friendship, they go around city stealing cars and just having the time of their lives with each other, meanwhile when Harold returns to his life with his rich and controlling mother, he realizes he'd never really experienced real life and that's why he doesn't care about it.I think the screeplay as well as the direction did a great job bringing such an odd story to life and giving a great meaning to it, I believe the message here is basic enjoy your life, take chances, be grateful for what you have, we see this in a lot of movies but never in such a creative way.There were also some sharp criticism in the humor here about social institutions, one of my favorite scenes is when Harold is about to be forced into alisting at the army and he and Maude make a plan together so he won't have to go, so you can imagine that this scene has a very smart humor. (I won't describe the scene so much so you don't get spoilers).Some of the serious parts and the drama are not so effective in my opinion, but I think it still works.I highly recommend this film, you may think some of the jokes here and there are a little outdated but I hardly disagree, this is way ahead of it's time and it's just great.I'm giving this a 8,5/10",

Maude draws smiles on the saints' statues in the church--she believes that anyone intimate with the Divine should be blissfully happy.It works on the level of ancient pre-Christain religion archetypes of the cyclical nature of life and rebirth. It gets mentioned several times in the movie. She is the Crone of the triune goddess, teaching the youth about life and love.The context of the movie must be seen as a retort to the Vietnam war, where men even younger than Harold's character were being used as mortar fodder on a daily basis. The draft was inescapable for the majority of young Americans at that time, which makes his uncle's diatrabes about the glory of Army life extremely ironic. Maude's soliloquy in the military cemetery is bittersweet. \"I feel that much of world's sorrow comes from people who are this(living things), yet allow themselves to be treated as that(endless rows of tombstones in the VA cemetery).\"Harold \"has it all\" but having and being are two different animals. Bliss is not something that can be picked up at Macy's. His mother keeps trying to fix his outsides to make the inside all right, with disatrous results for her pawns.If you look at the symbolism for the Major Arcana of a Tarot deck, you find the ground that Harold & Maude flourished in. If you take this movie too literally, you will miss a lot of the humor. This started out as a rock opera. Hal Ashby had a very wicked sense of humor. Look at the sly wit of \"Being There\", his last film.Unfortunately for our world one of Maude's observations still rings true \"Zoos are full, prisons are overflowing--oh my, how the world still dearly loves a cage!\"When Harold describes his adventures with chemistry, she gives him more excellent advice--\"A lot of people enjoy being dead, but they're not, really; they're just backing away from life. Reach out take a chance; get hurt even--play as well as you can--L-I-V-E, live; otherwise you've got nothing to talk about in the locker room.\"When was the last time you heard a character in a movie be that direct? This is the opposite of self-absorbed. Words to live by (bad pun). It took a time, a place, and a generation to make a movie like Harold & Maude. We weren't self-absorbed, we were reaching out for understanding in a world turned upside down. If you don't get this movie, don't despair. There's Prozac, internet porn, Botox, and a volunteer army.

Maude wrenches Harold free from his morbid and lonely existence to show him how lush and amazing the world can be and he emerges from his experiences a happy man.

            "content": "Attending funerals probably does not fit into everyone's definition of fun, but in Hal Ashby's Harold and Maude, starring Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort, the characters do just that. Set in San Francisco Bay area in the early 70's, Harold and Maude tells the story of Harold, a friendless, troubled, rich boy who is desperate for his mother's attention. This all changes when Harold meets Maude, an unconventional older woman, who becomes his friend, love interest, and mentor. At first the film, written by Colin Higgins, struck me as being very odd. After all, the story of a 19 year old boy who repeatedly fakes suicides, drives a hearse, and who falls in love with a 79 year old eccentric woman wouldn't be considered normal by most. However, despite its unusual plot, Harold and Maude is an entertaining movie with lessons on life and living it to the fullest, friendship, and love\u0085if you can get past the 60 year age gap between the two characters.The opening scene at first seems tragic. To the tune of Cat Stevens, Harold seemingly hangs himself in his ritzy California home. When Harold's mother discovers him, she ignores him and makes a phone call. These mock suicides, which happen a total of seven times throughout the movie (though Harold tells his psychiatrist he has done this about 15 times before), are all dismissed by Harold's mother, although they are an attempt for her attention. Harold seems to live a sheltered life, and is very quiet; his mother is not concerned with what he wants, as demonstrated in her want of Harold to join the military, or for him to get married. Cort's acting, which is characterized by little facial expression and an awkward manner contrasts with the acting of Gordon, who is boisterous, with exaggerated movements and tone of voice to portray her unusual character. The two form a friendship after meeting at a funeral; a friendship that consists of car stealing, visiting cemeteries and junk yards, spending time at Maude's train car home, and tree replanting. Most of the humor in the movie comes from wacky antics they do together. Cat Steven's \"If You Want to Sing Out\" is the song that Maude seems to live by, as she does whatever she wants (even if it's illegal), and becomes the theme of Harold and Maude's relationship.Interesting camera angles are used in unique ways throughout the film, adding to the films overall mood. At times, Harold adds a comical mood by staring directly into the camera, as if he and the audience are in on some inside joke, such as after he \"sets himself on fire\" in front of his first date. Moving shots also add to the humor, especially in the pool scene, where Harold has apparently drowned himself. After a shot of Harold, we get a shot of his mother walking to the pool. The shot follows his mother, until the audience discovers the two characters are in the same pool. Many shots focus on one aspect of an object, and then move to show the whole object, such as the front of a car or the light of a motorcycle. These odd shots add to the overall effect of this funny film.Overall, Harold and Maude is an entertaining and unconventional movie, which teens and adults alike can enjoy. While the idea of Harold and Maude's love still creeps me out, it's not enough to say the movie is bad, though it still seems unrealistic at times. The trick with Harold and Maude is to see past the unexplainable fake suicides, stunts, and nontraditional love, and take in what the movie is trying to tell you: to live life to its fullest. No matter your take on the movie, its theme of living and being yourself is something that everyone can appreciate.",

Harold (played by Bud Cort) is a boy who likes to do fake deaths and go to funerals in his free time. Maude on the other hand, loves life and can't wait till her 80th birthday. Their relationship turns from friendship to love.I would recommend \"Harold and Maude\" to anybody. The acting done by Ruth Gordon is unforgettable. Her spirit and liveliness in this film makes anybody watching want to be her. And Bud Cort. . . even though he doesn't speak much, his actions are memorable in many ways.Many people think that this relationship between a young man and a VERY old woman can't work.

            "content": "If there was ever a movie that makes you want to fake your own suicide, this has got to be the one. But seriously...I saw this movie in an art house theater in the U district in Seattle back in '71 or '72. Being only in my mid-teens at the time, it made for compelling viewing. Then, just the other night on AMC channel, I watched it again. It's the first time I've seen it in many years, and I must say - not having seen it in quite a while - I had almost forgotten what a moving film it really is.On the surface \"Harold and Maude\" was, and still is, a delightfully bizarre \"jet-black comedy\". I still laugh at the absurd, twisted physical jokes, but... this movie also works on other levels. I must admit it is heart-piercingly uncomfortable for me to re-watch this film, namely because the troubled, directionless and apathetic Harold (Bud Cort) is such an apt symbol of what I and perhaps many others felt like during those foolish and awkward days of youth. The movie brings it all back with a roar. (Gawd, like we need to be reminded!).Also, the movie does a fantastic job of recreating the unsettling \"zeitgeist\" of that era. History lesson: The late sixties/early seventies were such a troubled time; for those of you who don't remember, the U.S. was involved in a very unpopular war, and very little of the patriotic, support-the-troops fervor that you see nowadays existed back then. You don't have to look very deeply in this movie to see and/or feel the anti-war, anti-military, and anti-establishment sentiments. This movie aptly captures that \"spirit of the times\" (again, yeah - like I wanna' be reminded!). I know growing up is always difficult, but it was truly difficult to grow up during those times when so much of what you had been taught to value, trust and respect was constantly being questioned, desecrated, revealed as sham and so forth. That's not to say that this movie doesn't project its own positive vibes. It's just that, in some respects, the movie opens up old wounds.So yes, this was (and still is) truly an anti-establishment picture if there ever was one. Just the whole premise of a 20-year old young man dating (and bedding, and proposing marriage to..) an eighty-year old woman simply flies in the face of all that is holy and sacred to just about anyone, anywhere on the planet! But that's what makes this movie great, and well worth watching. It dares to be different, but is smart enough to do so with a pleasant eccentric charm rather than vulgar excess. And, the hippie-days Cat Stevens music, playing at just the right times, is wonderful icing on the cake.\nSome of the humor I particularly liked: I enjoyed Harold's visits to his one-armed Army officer uncle, who fills him with tales of military glory whilst in the background, totally off camera, you can hear the pounding cadence of a firing squad, marching a prisoner out to be shot. I also liked the \"this fills me with revulsion\" talk from the priest, replete with references to Maude's \"sagging breasts\" and \"flabby buttocks\". (Alone worth the price of admission!).Anyway, I love this movie; it works for me on so many levels. It is indeed a black comedy - but then again so was my youth, which took place about this time. It's only taken me 30 years to figure it out.",

It is a story of a death-obsessed 22-year-old neurotic Harold and an eccentric, touchingly childish 80-year-old \"sorceress\" Maude. The whole movie is seen through the prism of Harold's internal struggles. He is hungry for life, yet is mortified by what he perceives its utter lack of meaning. He wants sympathy, affection and attention, and tries to attain all of them by means of committing fake suicides -- but all for naught: Harold's ice-cold and haughty mother ignores him, ignores him as a sovereign human being, while treating him as a domesticated pet. At a certain juncture, Harold meets a highly non-conformist and easy-going old lady, Maude. She is \"sent\" to poor Harold by the dint of fate in order to rescue his soul from the utter morbidity within which it had sunk. The relationship which develops between them is beautifully portrayed in the film. Maude is conjured up into existence by Harold's \"guardian angel.\" She heals him. She cures him. She shares with him her internal sources of vitality. She teaches him the science of happiness, the most difficult science to master. She gives her life to Harold. The film leaves you with a lingering bitter-sweet feeling. Harold and Maude is a philosophical elegy, a film of lasting value, a movie the importance of which is only bound to increase.

For me Harold and Maude was one of those movie you always notice on the video store's shelves but never want to rent. You rent The Abyss instead or something like that.. I knew it had a good reputation but I always had the feeling that a movie with Harold and Maude as a title could only be boring. Why rent that when you can go with Predator? And for some reason I always got confused between Harold and Maude and Miss Daisy and her driver. Maybe because they both have old people in them. Well this week-end, around a campfire, my parents said that when they were going out, in the seventies, they saw Harold and Maude and thought it was great. Great for the time or great in general they did not know. So I rented it to find out.So ? So even if I don't think Harold and Maude is a masterpiece it clearly has the charm of the best films of that period of greatness in American cinema : the early seventies. I always thought that the main strength of movies like Scarecrow, Panic in needle park, The Graduate and, now, Harold and Maude was the blend of vitality and melancholy we can see in the wonderful way those movies are shot. The story of Harold and Maude is quite simple : a young man and an old lady fall in love and they share the best moments of their lives in a celebration of life. Of course the characters and situations are, for the most, original but I would not think it is as groundbreaking as some people might say. In my opinion, the similarities with The Graduate are too many to be purely coincidential. I like Cats Stevens when I hear him on the radio but I don't necessarily want to listen to his best-of while watching a movie. Maybe the production team of Harold and Maude took their influence in the use of Paul Simon's songs in The Graduate but in that movie we didn't have to listen to the Sound of Silence every other scene.The acting in Harold and Maude is top notch : I especially liked the actress playing Harold's mother. She's something of a caricature but we believe it anyway. In fact I think the movie succeed the most in the fake-suicide scenes. That's where the movie is the most cynical and funny. When Harold rediscover life, tough, I think the director is a bit clumsy (when Harold is blowing bubbles for instance). Sometimes it's a bit embarrassing really... As for the last sequence I think it sums up the message of the movie : that Youth will prevails even in Death... or fake-death ! 7.5/10.",

Well, last night I did, and I'm pleased to say that it truly is a superbly nuanced, beautiful piece of cinema. You probably wouldn't think a film could work as a black comedy, a biting social satire, and a sweet, sincere romance all at once, but Harold and Maude does--brilliantly.Harold Chasen (Bud Cort) is a repressed young man whose main outlets are attending funerals and staging of elaborate pseudo-suicides, much to the annoyance of his controlling rich-bitch mother (Vivian Pickles). At one of these funerals, he meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a wise, free-spirited old woman who careens around California in \"borrowed\" cars. What follows is one of the funniest and most touching pairings in screen history, exploring love, death, and the importance of living.All around, a witty, intelligent, wonderful picture, from the sparkling performances to the seamlessly executed material. I'm not much of a Cat Stevens fan (records like \"Wild World\" make my teeth grind), but the soundtrack here is truly great. In fact, the sanitized, get-along world could stand to learn something from Gordon's delightful heroine: Existing is not the same as Living, and not living is a fate far worse than death. Thanks, Maude.",

Gordon plays an apparent Holocaust survivor who has decided to live life to the fullest and by her rules only, and does a very good job of playing the free spirit.  Cort has some hysterical scenes as Harold, mainly playing off his mother's (Pickles) non-reactions to his fake suicides, and then to the shock of his blind dates.  This movie stays grounded the whole way through, and never goes for cheap and sappy sentiment, surprising me quite frankly.  The funniest scene in the movie is toward the end, when Harold has finally expressed his love for Maude.  You think everything is going to be big smiles and lush music, but instead we get a priest (Eric Christmas) articulating what is no doubt in the back of everyone's mind.  Big twist of an ending, too.  You really didn't see this kind of filmmaking again until the late 1990's.  Good stuff.",

The life and death themes are pat and detract from the black comedy. I don't recall too many serious conversations about life in the much funnier Kind Hearts and Coronets or Dr. Strangelove. I'm left to believe that the less discerning are attracted by the anti-authority, anti-military, anti-religion, anti-wealth tone.

He attends funerals and pretends to commit suicide in front of his mother. At a funeral, he meets a 79 plus woman They spend a lot of time together. He announces that he is to going to marry her.

I was a USN/USMC Corpsman back then (The DJ was volunteer) and we saw a couple patients due to the Movie. Couple of us (Corpsmen) went due to being recommended by the \"Psych\" staff at the Hospital to see it.The other thing of this Movie, is really showed how some acted back in the late 70s-early 80s.

The story revolves around a bored, lonely, and disenfrachised young man who is obsessed with death-so much so that he stages mock suicides for his mother's (with whom he lives alone) \"amusement\" and attends funerals for people he has never met. Harold has many eccentricities, but deep down, he just wants to be loved. At one of the funerals he meets Maude, a free-spirited optimist who doesn't see the crime in stealing cars (or trees) because they are materialist and sentimental objects \"..here today, gone tomorrow, so don't stay attached to things...\". They fall in love and not long after, Harold decides he wants to marry Maude. The only problem is, he's 20-ish years old, and she's turning 80 next week. Both Harold and Maude are two of the best characters the screen has ever seen; Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon both do great jobs in bringing them to life, and the black comedy that this film is rife with is absolutely brilliant. Hal Ashby's directorial skills are on full display, and the cinematography is flat out great (the picnic in the graveyard, need I say more?). A truly amazing, great, earnest movie with scenes that will make you both double over in laughter and wipe away the tears. 10 out of 10, this movie has no flaws. Put this at the top of your must-see list if you haven't seen it, and at the top of your see-it-again list if you have. I recommend watching it at least once every few months. -Kenneth",

The character of Maude was amusing & great at talking her way out of trouble, but definitely strange.  The 1970's clothes & decor date the movie strongly and the characters seemed more British than American in their accents & sensibilities, which was disconcerting.

True they sleep together but I suspect that was just some non erotic hugging and keeping each other warm. Harold is like Sheldon in the Big Bang Theory a man child that doesn't know he is gay or even what that is about just that he is not interested in women in a hetero way.The movie however is fun and quirky, but please keep the romance out of the way this is really about friendship at any age not love/lust way.

But man, this guy, his whole look, he looks like a young Bill Gates, and I don't know why, but whenever I see Bill Gates, I really get annoyed just by the way he looks.  Do you ever get that feeling, you get really irritated just by someone's physical appearance? Ya, Harold did it for me.  I was screaming for this film to be turned off after the first 10 minutes.  I got so bored of this film that I stayed bent over on my desk showing plumber's crack for the whole class period in hopes that a hall messenger would walk by and get a hairy surprise.  That's the only thing that kept me up through the film: the anticipation of seeing the disgusted look on an unsuspecting hall messenger's face.  If I wasn't ballsy enough to show my a$$ to people, then I would've been in hell for 85 minutes.  So the moral of the story is:watch Harold and Maude if you feel like showing some plumber's crack for 85 minutes straight.",

            "content": "Despite its '60's sensibilities and flower-power overtones, this is an outrageously funny (and touching) movie that still holds its own after nearly 3 decades. When it was first released by Paramount during the Christmas season of 1971, it was met with scathing reviews--and largely ignored. It was quickly discovered  by college students though, and continues to be a cult classic--particularly among college students. A surprising number of people (including myself) list this among their favorite movies, if not their *favorite* movie...how many other movies released so long ago can make such a claim? It's certainly different: 20 year old death-obsessed boy meets and falls in love with new-age octogenarian. It's not tasteless though. This film looks beyond the surface and there is great beauty in their doomed relationship. Cort and Gordon here complete each other--each has something the other desperately needs. Many of the lines are priceless--and immensely quotable. This is probably part of the reason it's achieved staying power. The dialogue is still as fresh and witty as it was in 1971--and Cort's fake suicides are truly hilarious. So is Vivian Pickles as his mother. Things wrap up a little too quickly--and the ending is ambiguous--but I think this was intended. Like a great painting, its meaning is open to interpretation, and asks more questions than it answers. A movie that begs to be seen more than once to fully appreciate. The underrated Bud Cort and late Ruth Gordon have an on-screen chemistry that transcends their ages--and just blows you away.",

I personally would classify it as \"wish you didn't spend 90 minutes of your life being submitted to hippy propaganda\".  The only person who would even remotely like this film is a tree hugger or a wannabe hippy, and even then I would think that they were lying to justify their lifestyle.

            "content": "This movie was made four years after \"The Graduate,\" which has now become much more popular and infamous than this film. The subject matter is similar. Like that film, \"Harold and Maude\" focuses on a disaffected young man from a wealthy family who develops a relationship with an older woman. One scene in particular--where Harold is shown in a pool, underwater, in one of his fake suicides--seems directly reminiscent of a scene in \"The Graduate.\" Yet here is where the similarities seem to end.While the relationship between Hoffman's Benjamin and Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson is purely sexual, Harold actually falls in love with Ruth Gordon's lively, optimistic Maude, whose passion and vitality are the antithesis of everything in Harold's sheltered, spoiled life. As a result, while \"The Graduate\" seems more of an exploration of the cynical, disillusioned elements of the late 60s, \"Harold and Maude\" rejects these ideas in favor of a more poignant, heartfelt story. Harold's romantic/sexual attachment to Maude is incidental; it is more important that Harold learns how to live life day by day, to embrace different experiences, and, most importantly, to love.And while this message today may seem dated, it's not one we hear nearly often enough today. The movie also transcends its message with memorable, likable characters: Harold, a rich, lonely twenty-year-old who frequents funerals and feels that fake suicides are the only way he can get the attention of his inattentive, self-absorbed mother, and Maude, a vital, lively octogenarian who \"borrows\" cars, poses nude for ice sculptures, and smokes bongs in her spare time. Their attachment to one another is genuine, and in spite of the \"ick\" factor of their age difference you find yourself rooting for the characters.Harold's faked suicide attempts can be a little disturbing for the faint of heart, but if you can get through the gore of some they turn out to be some of the funniest scenes in the movie. This is one of my favorites. With its unique characters and upbeat message, it is a movie that is about being happy and loving life, something that many films of subsequent decades seem to have lost sight of.",

            "content": "Harold and Maude: A Wild Ride; A Must SeeHarold and Maude, directed by Hal Ashby and released in December 1971, is a quirky story about two unexpected lovers. The two wacky main characters, Harold (Bud Cort), a 19 year old boy is obsessed with faking his own suicide and Maude (Ruth Gordon) a 79 year old woman who enjoys stealing cars and joyfully riding around, but never forgets that in just a small time she'll be 80. When the two meet at a funeral, an unusual friendship results. While the plot line is somewhat unbelievable, the eccentric characters and the fantastic filmmaker's craft make for a phenomenal movie. The bizarre characters keep the viewer on edge the entire movie. The scene in which the viewers meet Harold, he has \"hung\" himself. Soon we see that he is not really dead, but because the viewers were momentarily horrified by the fact that a movie would open with such a scene, an immediate love for Harold ensues. It soon becomes clear that he is just trying to gets his mother to pay him some attention and show that she loves him, and with this he has already stolen the hearts of the audience. And then there is Maude. How could one not love a 79 year old woman who enjoys stealing cars and lives so carefree? We first meet Maude eating an apple as she watches a funeral. Soon after, we see her steal her first car and we love her for her \"seize the day\" lifestyle, because who wouldn't want to live like that? The viewer continually is shown subtle hints to her past life, which allows the viewer to appreciate this attitude all the more. The terrific craft used in making this film allows the absurd plot to almost be sensible. The cut from Harold \"shooting\" himself, to yet another funeral scene creates a momentary gasp from the audience. They can easily predict that this isn't his funeral (as he has already faked his own suicide twice and been to several funerals), but for that split second they have to wonder what if? These moments in the movie deepen the emotional connection the viewer has with the characters. Every time Harold fakes a suicide, the cinematography allows the viewer to think, just for a moment and although they know it is not true, that Harold may have actually killed himself. The directors and editors use this to their advantage until the very last scene, making a remarkably edited film. The eccentric, but lovable characters and the terrific art used in making the film allows the viewer to completely forget that the plot is absolutely ridiculous. Because we have an immediate love for the characters, it doesn't bother us that Harold is always attempting completely unbelievable suicides and because of the editing, we almost believe them. Maude's attitude toward life makes us love her and we are completely entertained by all the ridiculous stuff she does and as the viewer gets more and more subtle hints as to what her past as consisted of, our respect and love just keeps growing. This movie is a must see, if not for the fall-out-of-your-seat laughter, than for the artful editing.",

I watched this film in my Philosophy class to discuss the theory of existentialism. The first scene really takes one off guard and has angelic music playing while someone (whose face is withheld till the end of the scene) is lighting candles. Then without warning the scene cuts to Harold dangling by his neck in a noose in the living room; the last thing I suspected. As if that wouldn't take you off guard enough, his mother walks into the room and is completely amused with Harold's \"childish games\" and continues to talk with him as he dangling from the rope as if he is just sitting in the chair next to her. It is this kind of witty dark humor that fills every scene of this film. That first scene really sets the tone for the whole movie. I most definitely enjoyed Maude just as well and would love to spend a day with her crazy and carefree logic. The contrast seen between Harold and Maude displays two sides to the way an existentialist's view life; either the \"life has no meaning, I'm not going to take part\" or \"life has no meaning, I'm going to make up my own rules as I go along.\" Two both very different extremes of this theory. I will also admit that Harold and Maude are probably the cutest together which make them hilarious. Overall, I think this film gave me some of my own inspiration for a view on life, but will definitely have to watch again to absorb everything after relaying the movie to the theory of existentialism.",

His rich mother simultaneously ignores him and smothers him, leaving Harold starved for affection and longing to join his deceased father, yet lacking the conviction to actually end his miserable existence.Enter Maude, a totally over-the-top senior citizen who is loopy, lovable, and overflowing with life. Played magnificently by the late, great Ruth Gordon, Maude is a true eccentric with an insatiable lust for life, and Harold is immediately drawn to her. They form a unique bond and develop a relationship which changes Harold profoundly.This movie stands the test of time. While the cars and clothes may be dated, the characters express feeling and emotion which does not change over time. And while all this sounds very deep and dramatic, this is actually one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. You really have to see this one for yourself, and I'm happy to hear that new generations of film lovers are continuing to enjoy this \"cult\" favorite.",

Colin Higgins wrote the screenplay as an undergraduate--as a lark, and was flatly told it was a flop. It was finally shot during the height of the Vietnam War. When it appeared, it was received by the \"Woodstock\" generation as an anti-war film. The romance between Harold and Maude is incidental (but definitely the break point for viewers). One must look beneath to see Higgin's focus. If you enjoy it, count yourself lucky that you can see deep meaning where others see disgust.

I love her urging him to drink oatstraw tea (very good for you). Also, the laughs never go away.

            "content": "Funniest Movie of the 1970'sThe movie Harold and Maude written by Colin Higgins and directed by Hal Ashby is one of my all-time favorite movies. Made in '71, it is a hilarious movie for teenagers on up. The humor is dark and at times gruesome, but viewers will find it hard not to laugh out loud. The movie stars Bud Cort as Harold and Ruth Gordon as Maude. Harold, (Bud Cort) is a nineteen year old man who is depressed and seeks a strange sort of attention from his mother. He fakes his death multiple times. For pleasure, Harold attends funerals, where he unexpectedly runs into an old woman, Maude (Ruth Gordon), who also goes to funerals for fun. The pair have many adventures together in the San Francisco Bay area of California, where Maude ultimately brings Harold out of his shell. Because of it's talented acting, excellent cinematography and unconventional story line, Harold and Maude is one of my favorite movies. Both Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are very skilled actors in their roles of Harold and Maud. In the beginning, Harold never smiles, has a stark white face and bulging eyes. From his facial expressions alone, the viewer can tell Harold is a morbid kid. His faking suicides are also very believable. It takes an up-close camera shots to tell he's not dead in many of the cases. Although beyond the beginning it looks like Harold doesn't change his expressions a whole lot, he shows quick flashes of deep, surprising emotions. When he and Maude are flying around the corners in Maude's stolen blue car, Harold looks scared. This is surprising because he seems so fearless. These quick facial signs show he wants to live after all. Also, in multiple places, his face shows a deep admiration and love for Maude. This also is strange because she is almost eighty while he is nineteen. Ruth Gordon portrays Maude's fearless sense of adventure and will to lives everyday to the fullest, very well. She even sings remarkably well for an eighty year old. Without the skilled acting of Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon as Harold and Maude, the movie would not be the classic that it is. The cinematography is extremely off-the-wall making it so viewers can't look away. In the beginning, there is a shot of a mirror streaked with blood and Harold lying below soaked in blood. This is the first shot that makes the viewers go, \"Wow! Did I really see that?\" Also, Harold is seen at funerals mourning with people he doesn't know for a complete stranger. Nevertheless, the shots show he looks to be one of the saddest people there. When his mother first brings a possible marriage candidate for Harold, he does a strange sort of ritual by the pool. The next scene is \"Harold\" engulfed in flames. Following this, the girl runs out screaming while Harold casually walks in from the back and smiles at the camera. Another scene that is remarkable crafty is a reflection of Harold's military uncle saluting with his right arm missing. Viewers be warned never to to look away for you will be sure to miss a crafty shot. The movie follows a strong theme that everything is impermanent, so no one should ever get too attached. Maude especially lives by this code. She is constantly stealing other people's cars. When Harold tells her he thinks people are getting upset, she says, \"I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder\u0085 don't get attached to things.\" Another one of Maud's quotes is, \"Try something new each day, after all life doesn't last forever.\" Maude lives moment by moment and gets Harold to start enjoying life too. The ultimate letting go for Harold comes at the end of the movie when Maude does something very surprising, (although there are clues if you look for them) that forces Harold to let go of the intense love he has for her. Letting go and living life moment by moment is a lifelong lesson presented in Harold and Maude. Harold and Maude is an excellent movie that combines skilled acting, crafty cinematography and a unique story line. Though people don't usually turn to a 1970's movie for entertainment, this is sure to please. Besides serving a comical purpose, Harold and Maude defies all stereotypes and shows that it takes adventure and enthusiasm to open the heart of those suffering from depression.",

            "review_title": "Over look of Harold and Maude",
            "content": "Harold & Maude directed by Hal Ashby and the written by Colin Higgins tells the story of the young Harold (Bud Cort) and Maude the spontaneous and elderly woman played by Ruth Gordon. The story starts with a confused 19 year old Harold and his various acts of fake suicides to catch his mother's attention with an overall obsession with death. As with Maude however, a 79 year old woman who seems spontaneous, doing whatever she pleases, seems to have a view of all people should live to 80 and that should be it. Whereas the characters seem to be a bit unique in their own ways the plot seems to carry that throughout the film. The use of narrative elements, film maker's craft, and acting allows for this film to be truly phenomenal. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The narrative elements in this film produce a stable structure for the rest of the film to build off. The movie itself takes place in an area around the San Francisco Bay; this can be seen through various screen shots of the bay and the cliffs overlooking the ocean. The viewer can see that much of Harold and Maude's time is spent in Maude's home composed of a Pullman car when Harold enters her house for the first time. The conflict can be seen through mostly his mother. Harold's mother, Mrs. Chasen, is obviously the antagonist in the story she does not seem to pay her son enough attention and in doing so he fakes suicide to get some. Eventually she gets sick of his unusual acts and tells him it's \"time now to put away childish things\u0085time for you to get married.\" Whereas the conflict seems to be his mother trying to get him to marry the plot seems to be him continuing to commit fake suicides and falling in love with Maude. Even with all of these very unusual events going on I was able to pull an overall theme out from all the controversy. Maude says that she \"likes to watch things grow\u0085cycle of life.\" Both Maude and Harold seem to have fascinations with death so it would only seem right that one theme would be about the cycle of life. The film maker's craft adds to the content to make the movie one worth watching. Editing seems to be one element that stood out the most to me in this film. The director did a great job cutting in and out of shots to make things appear to happen that did not. We can see Harold create this mock immolation of his own death. To the viewer it almost seems evident that it is actually Harold, but as the scene continues Harold comes into the picture and its impressive how the director is able to confuse not only the other characters in the scene but the viewer as well. SPOILER ALERT Another example of this in genius editing by the director is another fake suicide we see Harold attempt when he runs his car off the ledge it does not seem reasonable that Harold lived through it, but we are again fooled by this amazing editing skills by the director. Another element that the director does a good job showing is the realism of the suicides. It is obvious to me that he put a lot of time into making these scene seem so real. We see Harold cut his arm off and blood comes out it looks so real and the viewer is fooled just like the date in the scene. The realism of the fake deaths put on by Harold is so well composed by the director it helps this movie in being as incredible as it is. The acting is also unique and played very well within the film. All of Harold's acts of faking suicide are very well played out. The first scene when he pretends to commit suicide by hanging himself could not have been played any better. I was almost appalled by the start of the story thinking for sure that this character was already dead. The believability of Harold's fake deaths' is amazing it was hard for me at times not to think that Harold was dead even after the second and third times of seeing him fake them. When he is pretending to be drowned in the pool this is just another example of how well the acting in this scene is. When we meet Maude we are able to see how well Ruth Gordon plays her part. Maude is sitting eating an apple during a funeral of someone she did not know either. Ruth Gordon does a good job at perceiving a character that seems to know what she wants and a very spontaneous personality. Not only are the narrative elements, filmmaker craft, and acting spectacular in this film it does however shed a bit of humor. The scene that takes place between these two intervals is shocking, very unexpected, and unconventional. When I combine these three descriptions together and the circumstance I find this part of the movie to be very humorous. Other times in the film that seem humorous occur not only when people are talking but just screen shots as well. His mom and his date come out to see his Jaguar, but it has been remodeled and the expression on his mother's face leave myself laughing. Overall this film seems to have all the components to being great and I myself believe that that is an understatement.",

            "review_title": "A very fun movie!",
            "content": "What makes a great movie great? There is a wide spectrum of answers to this question, such as the film's characters, the actors, soundtrack, the director's craft, and even the sometimes-subtle lessons that can be learned from viewing the film. In the 1971 film Harold and Maude, directed by Hal Ashby, all of these aspects are each well deserving of attention, and when all are combined react in such away that creates a very colorful and fun viewing experience. Harold Chasen (played by BudCort) is a 19-year old boy who lives with his wealthy middle-aged mother, and spends his time attending random funerals and feigning suicide. As his activities would suggest, Harold has a sort of morbid disposition, which does not bode well with this mother. As Harold struggles to escape the lifestyle his mother believes is right for him, he meets Marjorie \"Maude\" Chardin, played by Ruth Gordon, is a very active 79 year-old woman who like Harold enjoys attending the funerals of strangers. Although they share that similarity, Maude lives a lifestyle in which she essentially lives everyday like it's her last. As the story progresses and the relationship between Maude and Harold grows we also see a change in Harold's attitude, as he has adapted Maude's way of seeing things. Many aspects of the film contribute tomaking watching this movie such a great experience. First of all, you have the contrast between characters Harold and Maude. When we first meet Harold nearly everything about him is symbolic for death; the hearse he drives around, often visiting random funerals, and faking his own suicide. Maude, on the other hand, can be seen as a symbol for actually living life, which can be seen through her everyday activities, like stealing cars, playing music, being a nude model, and something to do with a hookah. The contrast between the two characters,along with the changes we see in Harold (becomes interested in things other than death, and becomes less pale) create some element of comedy, and is overall a fun thing to see. Secondly, the film's soundtrack doeswonders to establish the 'feel' of a scene. For instance, during amontage in which we see Maude and Harold participating in various activities (i.e. dancing on a hilltop) we hear the song \"If you want to sing out, sing out\", of which the lyrics go \"Well, if you want to singout sing out/And if you want to be free, be free 'Cause there's amillion things to be/ You know that there are\". Another example is when Harold is pretending to have drowned in his pool, and we hear classical music as the camera pans out from a closeup of his face. Perhaps the most important aspect of the film though, the director's craft involved with developing the film. An example of clever authors craft is the progression of Harold's skin tone throughout the film. As we see the story progress and him become more active with Maude, we also see Harold's complexion become darker, a result of him spending more time \"living\". This physical change is symbolic for Harold's shift in mental attitude. In addition to many subtle messages that can be found, like the example just given, is the overall theme of the film, be who you want to be.Overall I would say that this is a great movie, especially from a time of which the attitudes, opinions, etc. from the characters matched that of the counterculture at the time. The soundtrack (by Cat Stevens) accompanies the story snugly and provides something fun and easy to listen to, while the constant activity and body language amongst the characters keeps it appealing to the eye. Looking deeper than the physical aspects of the film lies the artistic beauty that can be found in the contrasts of two opposite people.",

Maude is one of the most beautiful characters I've ever encountered, and nobody but Ruth Gordon could have played her. If you are fed up with life, or feel as if you're just existing, not living, get hold of this movie and take in its life-affirming message.It's a shame \"Harold and Maude\" has been dubbed a \"cult film\" and a \"hippie flick.\" I'm sure such labels have scared away lots of people who could benefit from it. If you know such a person, simply tell them it's a black comedy, then sit them down to watch it!",

            "content": "Harold and Maude is a strange film for sure, and it might turn some viewers away at first, but this film can teach good life lessons and that is what makes it so great. This film is about a strange old lady who helps a young man to be happy and be himself, and they fall in love at the same time. \u00a0 This movie was directed by Hal Ashby, and Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon play the main characters. The acting in this film is very good; Ruth Gordon is perfectly crazy and fun, Bud Cort is strange and gives off the feeling of needing love and attention, and Vivian Pickles as Harold's mother seems very high class and like an odd mother to live with. Film elements and production quality are also very good in this film. Every shot and scene seems planned out very well, and the cameramen got to be creative since there are scenes clearly shot from helicopter like the scene where Harold and Maude are escaping from the cop on the motorcycle. The soundtrack for this film is also very good. Cat Stevens does all the music for the film so each song is perfect for the story and the situation. The main song of the film \"If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out\", was made for the film by Cat Stevens and it reflects the main theme of the film very well; That theme is to live life to the fullest and freely. \u00a0 The plot of this film is another good point because it is engaging and exciting, but it also perfectly shows how Harold changes to become a happier person. At the beginning of the film it is clear that Harold has issues, he keeps committing fake suicides and he never seems to be happy or enjoying himself. Then he meets Maude at a funeral and after a while they are out doing strange things together slowly changing Harold into a more freely acting person. The change in Harold is so subtle and perfectly done you don't even notice exactly how he changes through the film. For example, through the film Harold gets more tan and starts dressing more colorfully.In conclusion, this is a feel-good, happy, and funny film that can really teach you things about living a happy life, and that is what makes this film so good. One warning though, nobody should watch this film if suicide is a touchy subject because you see Harold commit many realistic looking fake suicides throughout the movie, and because, SPOILER ALERT, Maude actually does commit suicide at the end and it is a sad part in the movie.",

            "content": "In Harold and Maude, there are a lot of examples of cinematic and dramatic elements.  These elements often help bring out the literary elements of the film including plot, character development, and emotional connections. Most of the elements are cinematic, but there are many examples of dramatic elements as well. In the opening scene, there are several examples of dramatic elements including the patchy lighting on the staircase, light and happy music, candles being lit, and he even writes a letter.  These things open the story with a contradictory mood.  The patchy lighting brings a dark mood, but the music has a lighter mood.  The mix is confusing, but the mood is severely altered to a depressing mood when he hangs himself.  Although, the mood quickly changes back when his mother walks in and completely ignores the fact that he hangs there.  The movie is full of these confusing mood swings, but the viewer gets used to the fact that this is not a normal story. There are many cinematic elements that bring out the literary elements of the story.  For example, there are several different shots taken that contain no dialogue, and the viewer only sees a scene with music.  When Harold gets his new Jaguar, a shot is taken of him welding something.  The viewer cannot see what he is welding, but this shot foreshadows a change in something metal.  The conclusion that he is changing his car is made by the viewer during this scene, and it is confirmed later on when his new sports hearse is revealed.  Another shot is taken of Harold and Maude dancing. This shot shows the connection growing between the two.  This one single shot develops both of the characters and shows that Harold is changing. One scene was taken of Harold playing the banjo which deepens the viewer's understanding that Harold is changing into a happy person because of love. The action scenes, especially the ones with the motorcycle cop, really dig deep into the characters and show more of their new-found connection. There are a lot of other examples of how the cinematic and dramatic elements in this film help to bring out the literary elements.  Irony is used a lot in this film, and the speech and actions of the characters, especially Harold, help show it.  These elements may or may not create a good movie, but they do create an interesting story.",

I first saw it in my US history class in high school and, along with the rest of the class, I alternated between shock and laughter, just as the filmmakers (and our history teacher) had planned.  Of course the late-60s/early-70s were all about questioning traditional values, freeing the mind of old, artificial boundaries, and exploring new ways of living, and Harold and Maude both embodies that ethos (being a movie that breaks out of the filmmaking box, both stylistically and subject-matter-wise, from start to finish) and satirizes it by taking such currents as the sexual revolution and draft dodging to stunning extremes (and setting them against oppositely extreme, caricatured figures representing establishment culture, to great comic and ironic effect).  At the same time, the movie manages to be both a touching coming-of-age story and a tender love story as well.It's difficult to imagine Harold and Maude being made today, but that makes it all the more important for anyone who wants to understand the crucible that American culture went through in the 60s/70s or anyone who just wants to experience the pure joy of watching one of the greatest, most truly creative feature-length movies from an era when movies were at their fearless and inventive best.",

An example is that the mood at the beginning of the movie was set due to the fact that the camera focused on Harold's feet and legs, building up suspense until we finally see that he has `hung' himself. The character of Harold is unique because he is set-apart from most boys his age.  Instead of being obsessed with nice cars and parties, Harold enjoys driving his hearse to the funerals of people he doesn't even know. The dramatization of Harold is really what makes him who he is.  His facial expressions seem to be speaking more than his words.  For example, the way that Harold looks at his mother makes his disgust for her very obvious. Without these facial expressions, Harold just wouldn't be the character he is. The part of Harold's mother was also enhanced with dramatization.  The way she carried herself and the way she spoke really gave the audience a clear representation of her elite status.  Her wardrobe also reflects her luxurious lifestyle with fancy dresses and hats. Maude, a free-spirited old woman who defies all stereotypes of an elderly woman, wants to live her life to the fullest, especially in her last week. She doesn't let anything hold her back.  Maude's nature is reflected in both her costume and her acting.  The fact that she wears light and airy colors to funerals shows us that she doesn't participate in anything that is considered proper or appropriate.  Maude can not understand the reasoning behind doing things just because they are expected of you.  She doesn't view death as a sad thing, but as just part of life.  She makes this clear when she says that eighty-years-old is a `good time to pass on.' Harold and Maude's relationship with each other is shown partly through their eyes, especially through Harold.  His affection for Maude is obvious by the way he looks at her.  I believe that his love would be obvious even if he never said a word. Perhaps a theme of this movie is that love has no boundaries.  This theme is brought out by both conversations and the interaction between Harold and Maude.  For example, Harold says `I like you Maude.'  Right after these words, he and Maude are shown dancing.  This scene is one of the parts in the film that shows both the contrast between the two ages, and the closeness that they share.",

            "content": "Harold and Maude's dramatic elements, and cinematic elements, such as accents, lighting, shots, and scenery bring out the literary elements.  In the beginning of the movie when Harold is walking down the spiral stairs, the lighting is dark and the shot is focused only on his feet as he descends.  This suggests the dark and ominous mood that is set in once Harold proceeds to hang himself.  The music that Harold plays as he is getting ready to commit suicide contradicts the dark mood with some up beat tunes, suggesting a sick humor that resides in Harold.  Harold's mother paying no attention to him hanging by the neck sets off a whirlwind of confusion, which plays nicely into the contradicting mood along side the music.  Another part that goes in well with the mood is the cinematic element of a close up on Harold's eyes.  Harold's eyes are sunken and wide, imposing a uncomfortable mood to every other character he talks to, all except Maude.   The music throughout the entire movie is great, wonderful music all of which is done by the same artist; it's really like a hippie's 70's soundtrack, very full and lush.  Cat Stevens did a wonderful job on the entire soundtrack.  His sound brought of the theme of living life to the fullest.  Maude's character always wore bright clothing, like that of a young person.  The zoom in on her arm shows the tattoo code from a concentration camp, without the close up its something you wouldn't normally see.  The parallel editing between the hospital scene and Harold's drive to and off the cliff advanced the plot quickly and effectively.  Maude's birthday party was decorated with flowers all around, gave one a concrete idea of the joy Maude feels and a more spectacular view than could be imagined from literature.  The fact that the plot was reveled at different points in the movie from Maude's dialogue was subtle.  The psychiatrist that Harold sees is mocked or provoked by Harold when he dresses exactly like the psychiatrist.  Maude's clothing at the funeral is bright and cheerful, and its there that she meets Harold and says that 80 is a good time to die, that's the first indication of the plot.  The second comes from when Maude talks about it all ending on Saturday which happens to be her 80th birthday. All these elements complement the literary elements in the movie.",

It is apparent tht the most intreging elements of such a divine masterpiece are the literary elements, which would be accented by the dinamic dramatic and cinematic elements. In any film, two of the main points are substance and depiction. Not only is the story line essential, but also the way in which the plot is portrayed to the viewer. In looking at \"Harold and Maude\" the director uses many cinematic and dramatic elements to bring the viewer to a consensus, as to what is happening in the storyline. By giving snap shots of Harold in the beginning with only music playing, gives the viewer a sense of who Harold is. The director uses silence as a virtue. It is seen that by allowing dramatic silent pauses at the end of chaotic siutations, the next few lines spoken have attention drawn to them. At times acotrs movements, or a setting, correspond with the music; hence, the words of a song are pulled to focus and for further meaning or importance. For example, when the scene changes to sunshile, \"I see the light\" plays in the background. Listeners also focus on the words of a song when the music begins to play softly at first, then as it gradually gets louder, again, causing the lyrics to stand out. Harolds encounters with women, particularly the women his mother set him up with, and his smiles, frowns, and nonchalance faces made the viewer focus on what was being said, to make him make such faces. When the camera zoomed in on a characters face, depending on the tone of voice and the speek in which the character spoke, allowed the listener to know where the key points of the story were and exactly what was going on in the highlights of the story line. Maudes vioce seemed to change each time she spoke, which also put emphasis on what it was she was saying , such as her whispering and spelling words out. When the music of one scene gradually gets louder, reachers its peak, then abrubtly stops, the worrds from the voice, beginning the next scene are the focus of the next scene. The characters dress was also a major part of knowing the importance of the characters words. Harolds mothers costume she wears when she tells Harold he must enlist in the Army emphasises the seriousness of her words. Many scenes began with a holding glance of scenery, then a persons voice would overlap it, by using this technique, all focus is on the words.",

Watching \"Harold and Maude\", I could not help but be reminded of Anderson's film style, both in choice of plot and technique. Anderson films explore eccentric characters who are often stoic and their reactions to life's events. Harold is such a character and his actions remind me greatly of those of Luke Wilson's character Ritchie Tenenbaum. Furthermore, the manner in which Ashby conveys his character's emotions to his audience must have influenced Anderson. Anderson often places emotional scenes against a background of folk music, which is reminiscent of the entirely Cat Stevens soundtrack that Ashby uses to keep his story clean and simple. I have long been an Anderson fan. I am glad to have found a film that I feel must have served to influence Anderson's unique style. I am also intrigued that Bud Cort is, in fact, a character in \"The Aquatic Life of Steve Zissou.\" This connection seems to enforce the idea that Anderson was impressed by \"Harold and Maude.\"",

            "content": "In some movies, there are dramatic elements and cinematic elements, which help to bring out the literary elements. Harold and Maude is one of the many movies that this applies to. Bud Cort, the actor who played Harold, made his hand shake when he was holding the gun up to his head. It showed that he was going to kill himself, which he only pretended, and by shaking his hand he made the fake death look real to viewers. During the whole movie, Harold wore black suits. The costumes were a symbol to Harold's view of life and that he thought the world was all dark and scary. He loved to fake his own deaths and the black suits represented how death was a part of him. Also, during funerals people usually dress up nicely and wear black clothing. Harold went to a lot of funerals, of people who he did not know, so the costumes also represented what he wore to the funerals. Another way that the dramatic elements and cinematic elements helped to bring out the literary elements was Maude's home. It was bright and colorful on the inside and it also had many different things in it that made it seem like a peaceful place. On the outside of her home, it was black and it looked like it had just been in a fire because it was burnt. This showed that the outside world is mean and scary for people to be in and people just need to find a place where the world will not be scary for them and they can be themselves. This setting also confirmed the famous saying, `don't judge a book by its cover'. People just need to look past the outside of things and reach deep inside to find out that there is more on the inside then other people notice on the outside. At the end of the movie when Maude killed herself, Harold made his car go off the cliff. While he was on his way to the cliff, the camera showed the side view of his car and also the front view of his car. While showing the front view, the camera made the car look like it was coming straight toward the viewers. The camera angles made viewers think that something was going to happen in the plot of the story. This was because the camera went back and forth between the two views, which gave suspicion.",

The realsitic sound foucuses on some minute details that normaly viewers would not notice, the sound of the nuese tightening in the opening scene, choking on the nuese, the sound of doors shutting, and the sound of the hurried steps during a staged chase. All these instances help the viewer grasp the reality of the humor in these cases, as well as the true nature of several characters, such as Harold's chocking to get attention, the sounds also serves as a climax in scenes later relaxed by some comical statement. Special effects, as in most feature films plays a major role in Harold and Maude. Again adding some tidbit of humor, but also revealing more of the nature of the characters, and then of course the theme. Muade falling through the floor during a planned chase showed to the audeince the precision that went into such a small event, showing Harold and Maude's love for the chase, the game, and the love of fun. Later on, the scene of the porshe turned hearse owned by Harold is sent carreening off a cliff to smash onto the rocks below, a heartstopping event that poses major significance in the resolutoin of the film, and the peace that Haorld finally comes to, as well as seriving as the dish for wich the theme of living life is served on.  Editing, the single most influential aspect on nearly any movie, is nonetheless just as powerful in Harold and Maude. With choices to show Maude driving in circles to flee a police officer, stealing an officer's car and shooting a POV shot to show Maude waveing to the officer.  Even the parallel editing in the final minutes of the movie, showing the race, and wait at the hospital and the stress drive afterwards simultaneously leads to the  great understanding of the movie's characters and themes.  Harold is finally content with who he is, Maude is happy that she has lived and lived so wondrously, and the viewer is presented with a magnificant teaching on life, and how to live and live happily, not worrying about outside influences, not worrying about what others think, to live and be happy. This happy tone is only enunciated by the consistant use of an upbeat, positive flowing soundtrack that highlights individuality, and happiness, the major foundations of the themes of the movie. Even to the last scene, the melodies are played, as a zoom shot shows Harold overlooking a cliff playing his banjo, the audience comes to the realization that finally Harold will live.",

The main characters are Harold who is played by Bud Cort and Maude who is played by Ruth Gordon. This film is about this young man named Harold, who gets enjoyment out of pretending to commit suicide and going to funerals, that is until he meets this very strange 79 year old lady, Maude, at a funeral. They end up becoming great friends and enjoy being together, that is until Maude's 80th birthday when she takes some pills because she believes that you shouldn't live past 80.In Harold and Maude Harold does many bizarre things, things people don't really do for fun, but they are very interesting to the audience, for example going to funerals for fun. He enjoys going to random peoples funerals and sitting there and watching the whole thing. He also in the beginning of the film several times fakes his own death, but not in a peaceful way, he does it with such anger for example with the scene of him in the bath tub with blood all over the bathroom. He does it in a way that makes it truly look like is dead. Most of the things he does in this film are very entertaining though. Like his and Maudes relationship. He is about 18 or 19 and Maude is 79 and 80 by the end of the film. Their friendship begins with them at a funeral and throughout the rest of the film they are great friends and even become more than that by the end. The strangeness of their friendship is what helps make the movie so funny and entertaining. Maudes this old woman who loves to \"borrow\" things from total strangers, like other peoples cars. Throughout the film you see her steal many different cars and one time it's even Harold's hearse in the scene between 21:35 and 24:34.I think that the importance of this film is to entertain you. It was made so that you could have a laugh at Harold and Maudes strange but cute friendship. I think that it was also made to show that no matter what, you always have a friend, even if you are a strange person like Harold.",

You watch how much Maude affects Harold and causes him to change and value his life much more than he used to. Because of Maude, Harold learned the meaning of life. It shows how we're all different, have vastly different stories, yet we find each other somehow and learn from each other.

            "content": "Harold and Maude is a dark comedy that has become a cult classic for good reason.  It's smart, extremely well-acted, and laugh-out-loud funny.  Though it was a failure at the box office when it was released in 1971, this film has gone on to gain much deserved acclaim and recognition.  \n\nHarold (Bud Cort) is a young man of wealth, obsessed with suicide and death.  He spends enormous amounts of energy with staging suicide attempts, much to the exasperation of his mother, Mrs. Chasen (played to detached perfection by Vivian Pickles).  Her typical response when finding Harold hanging from a ceiling or cut up on a closet floor is merely one of annoyance.  A scene where she engages in a morning swim (accompanied by Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto #1) as she nonchalantly completes laps around Harold's \"drowned\" body is hysterical.  Most of her time in the film is spent as the conduit for arranging possible dates for Harold, something she thinks will assist him in life.   Harold turns each of her perspective date interviews into a spectacle of antics.\n\nWhen Harold isn't planning or staging ways to play out his demise, he likes to spend time attending funerals.  It is at one of these funerals that he meets Maude (Ruth Gordan), an eccentric 79-year-old woman who lives life on her own terms, with little care for standard social boundaries or regulations.  She believes that one should experience something new every day, and she's more than willing to bend the rules of social norms to achieve that goal.  Her joie de vivre is one that Harold is unaccustomed to and something that excites and invigorates him.  The two begin to spend more and more time together, until their friendship eventually becomes romantically emotional and physical.  Neither caring that their relationship would be considered taboo by most others.   \n\nMaude ultimately determines that embracing life for all it has to offer must also include accepting death as well.  Unfolding events leave Harold forced to finally make the ultimate decision of whether he wants to fully embrace the death he has obsessed over, or to embrace the life that Maude has unveiled to him.\n\nAt its core, the film is one of presenting contrasts\u2026 life and death; young and old; fullness and emptiness; color (Maude's deserted train car home) and dull (Harold's mansion home); simplicity and complexity (a daisy or a field of daisies).  The cinematography, set in and around the San Francisco area is gorgeous, and the music and costuming firmly cement the film to the nineteen-seventies.  Most of the film features original songs written and performed by Cat Stevens.  Watching this movie was like enjoying a little time-capsule of celluloid, intended to simply remind any viewer of any time period that life is precious, fleeting, and what one chooses to make of it.  It may well have been produced ahead of its time, but it has more than caught up\u2026 or we have.",

            "content": "A dark delight with a striking warmth.\n\nHal Ashby's black comedy romance drama Harold and Maude (1971) is a peculiar film with a multi-faceted style I enjoyed very much. It's very much a black comedy with morbid humor as Harold is a young man who wants to kill himself and you see him attempt various forms of faked suicides, and it's hilarious every time. John A. Alonzo shoots with a wide shot, so you can see all the suicide recreations and quirky dates Harold and Maude undertake.\n\nHal Ashby's direction deftly balances these otherwise dreary scenes into an upbeat comedy that is ultimately life affirming. Harold meets Maude, an older lady and develops a true fondness for her as she has fun with Harold and gets him to slowly start to appreciate living. There are heartfelt moments and absurd car chases to funny funerals. I was laughing at the ridiculous jokes, thinking about the existential crisis these two are having, while finding solace in their peaceful conclusion. Harold and Maude is unlike any other romantic comedy ever made.\n\nWriter Colin Higgins wrote quite a brilliant script. You get to know the estranged and absurd relationship between Harold and his indifferent and frustrated mother. Vivian Pickles is hilarious as Harold's mother Mrs. Chasen as she arranges several dates for Harold, yet she's really ignoring him. Higgins' writing lets you know Harold feels depressed and neglected by his shallow mother as she can only think of his marriage as leading to his happiness or normalcy. Bud Cort is a young and interesting actor as he looks younger than he is as Harold Parker Chasen, while also conveying Harold's inner sadness naturally. He's quite good.\n\nRuth Gordon is hilarious and delightful as the exuberant Maude. You see how she loves life and plays around with stealing cars and trees to speed down the highway, taking every opportunity to have fun like skidding around corners at top speed. She's a treat to watch as she always feels genuine and kind, if insane at all times. Editors William A. Sawyer and Edward Warschilka cut quickly for a fast pace for 91 minutes like these car chase segments. \n\nI love when Tom Skerritt's highway patrol cop stops her in disbelief and dismay. It's a funny cameo. I liked director Hal Ashby's cameo at the amusement park with his distant stare and enormous beard. Cyril Cusack cameos as an artist doing a nude painting of Maude, while Charles Tyner portrays Ashby's anti-war sentiments and those of the hippies with his gung ho for war general. As he raves about the benefits of warfare and the military, you cannot help but notice wounded veterans, including Tyner with one arm that can only salute his nation with a missing arm. I enjoyed Ellen Geer's shallow actress Sunshine with her weird performance. Isn't she just perfect for Harold? Lastly, Eric Christmas' Priest character is a riot with his disapproval and disgust for Maude..\n\nWilliam Ware Theiss' costumes look just like stylish hippie suits and patterns, which fits 1971 perfectly. Cat Stevens' gentle folk songs adorn Harold and Maude with a bittersweet warmth and a musical calm at all times. You feel Cat Stevens adding a melancholy, yet his songs also sound happy or content with life in a way. Bob Stein's make-up ensures everyone looks dead and pale, especially Harold.\n\nIn all, Harold and Maude is all you need.",

It's an odd film, there's no getting away from that, but often odd means interesting. The opening scene sees Harold seemingly hanging himself, only for us to quickly realise this is his favourite hobby, planning elaborate fake suicide attempts to shock his long suffering mother. It's an unusual past time, and clearly one that probably warrants therapy of some sort. But Harold's Mum is past making the time and effort for his issues, she persistently tries to set Harold up with various girls in a bid to imprint some sort of normality onto his life. But once Harold meets Maude, a seventy-nine year old lady who leads him on an amusing trail of mischief, all hope of a 'normal' romantic association goes out the window. Maude tries to impress upon Harold the importance of living life to the full, and their relationship is the story. It's heartwarming, weird, and very darkly amusing.",

On the other, Harold with his pseudo-suicidal ideation, like Hamlet preferring to avoidantly act out rather than responsibly take action, his morbid curiosity a means of treating death as a perpetual fantasy that can be lived out, out lived, and thus ultimately lived without. Flip sides of the same coin, both must come to see that life and death, too, are flip sides of the same coin, that (as Heidegger puts it) \"as soon as one comes to life, they are at once old enough to die,\" so that escaping the boxes and cages that the establishment, the Man, das Man, tries to contain us in\u2014the mechanical death camps of the holocaust, the algorithmic boxes of computer dating\u2014means embracing the final pine box (perhaps cut from the same tree the couple plants in the forest) of the tomb.",

I agree with the criticism of one of the more pandering shots of the film, namely the 'incidental' focus on Maude's extermination camp tattoo without referencing it in dialogue that is intended to add some depth to her character by contrasting her bubbly personality, but ends up feeling unecessary. Taps into a teenage angst and rebellion that has endured to the present, and in a unique way, but is really hammered home by Gordon's caring and bright performance. (3.5/5)",

Ashby's work is notable, because you can truly feel his lineage as an editor. The film (and other Ashby flicks) is streamlined in a way that will feel familiar to the modern thread of music video stylings where atmosphere and music often carry scenes and visual sequences. But heart is tucked in -- not paved over -- and while it's a tempered physical love affair on screen, the fullness of young Bud Court's heart is on full display.

What a terrific conceit to have these two counterpoints converge and give rise to each other's highly individualized character sketches. Their unlikely but deeply felt affair is set to be physically actualized on Maude's 80th birthday.\n\n\"Harold and Maude\" entered the cultural conversation through an unassuming door at the apex of the Vietnam War -- there's a sense of anti-establishment and selective ignorance of social principals lurking beneath the film's plain brown wrapper which surely explains its appeal in its day.

Through his intrigue, Harold happens to meet Maude - a 79-year-old woman who embraces and lives life to the fullest. Initially, I found the film to be uninteresting, and was intrigued as to why his relationship with his mom was so dysfunctional. Over time, as his and Maude's connection grew and deepened, I started to really enjoy it. It made me think that we can truly have connections with anyone - regardless of their age or background. Written by Colin Higgins, I think that the greatest strength and weakness of the story is the concept. I enjoy that it is unique, however, it did feel to be a little far fetched in the grand scheme of things - that these are two people that would actually fall in love. Directed by Hal Ashby, I particularly enjoyed the pacing and rhythm of the scenes. Ashby ensured that if a scene needed more time - it had it, and I appreciated that. This was evident when Harold was throwing Maude her surprise birthday party. With each shot, I felt like I was hanging onto every word that each character was saying. This is also a great representation of the editors, William A. Sawyer and Edward Warschilka. John A. Alonzo, the cinematographer of the film created a color palette that consistently used cooler colors. For me, this was especially evident in the scene when Maude is stealing the tree and gets pulled over on the interstate by the cop. Overall, I would have liked for the film to delve more into Harold and Maude's relationship, as I felt like it was just barely scraping the surface, but I found myself to really enjoy it!",

There's also something interesting that happens as you watch the film, because you find that you start to become desensitized to Harold's behavior much like his own mother. I started off genuinely disturbed, and never would have thought that minutes later I'd be laughing at similar things. \n\nThe magic of Harold and Maude starts with the performance of Bud Cort. He delivers a lot of personality as Harold and somehow makes you care about a young man who has some serious issues. His character goes through a real arc in the film and you can feel it in his portrayal. Ruth Gordon provides an interesting counterpoint as Maude. Her wacky carefree attitude almost seems like it would clash with Harold. However, the two of them have a strange connection in the film and it seems to enrich both of them.\n\nWhile Harold and Maude took me completely by surprise, I was delighted how much it clicked with me. The story is off the wall, darkly humorous, and also emotional at times. There were some parts in the second half that I didn't love as much because they took things to an extreme that seemed unbelievable. At a certain point you'd wind up in jail without question. I suppose there's a level of whimsy in the film and someone could ignore the illogical, but that aspect didn't quite work for me. I also struggled a bit with the ending, because it was, well let's just say...disappointing. Still the movie was funny and overall a winner.",

Very free spirited and free loving, peace and love - all that stuff. Also fights for what's right. Regardless wether he killed himself in the car crash or not, he seems a lot happier as if he's freed himself from the sadness and depression he once knew. My theory is that he did in fact kill himself, or rather his old miserable self and can now live freely and joyfully with Maude at his side because of what Maude taught him.\n\nSo darkly comedic in nature. One of the most quirky and odd dark comedies out there. This movie has quite the beautiful message though. You have to live life and see the beauty in everything. Harold wants to end his life yet he has his whole life ahead of him whereas Maude wants to live life to its fullest yet has a couple of days left to live. Maude was exactly what Harold needed in his life. She turned it around for him. \n\nThere's definitely no other movie quite like this one.

The film centers on a unique relationship between a young teen, Harold, who's obsessed with death and an elderly woman, Maude, who is overjoyed with life. They are brought together by their mutual affection for funerals where Harold wallows in the grief and Maude lightens the mood. The two then become inseparable as they bring out the best in one another and go on a myriad of insane adventures with Maude truly being one of the most unpredictable characters I've ever seen, literally stealing cars at a whim and disregarding every law in the book. The film's style can only be described as Wes Anderson meets the Addams Family, and this film has inspired many filmmakers today to produce off-beat and quirky cinema. One of the more hilarious aspects of the film is Harold's constant torturing of his mother and the girls she tries to set him up with where he performs fake, but realistic-looking suicides, that really layer the film's creativity and they always made me laugh. As the film goes along, Harold and Maude's relationship grows more romantic as they are the only two people who understand one another and this is obviously the film's most controversial area. I went into this film with an open-mind, much like I did with the film, Her, and I applaud this movie for taking such a mature look at sexuality, regardless of the age-gap, and while it is pretty wrong for an 80 year-old woman to be having intercourse with a 16 year-old kid, the psychology between them makes it more than believable. This is a very special film that digs deep into the psyche of the two main characters and as we learn more about their pasts, we become deeply attached to both with Harold's, wiser-than-his-years maturity, and Maude's larger-than-life spunk. It's a challenging film that can be analyzed to no end, and it's a film I will never forget due to the incredible writing, emotional connection, and fantastic, upbeat soundtrack!",

Others will find it profundly moving and life affirming.\nIn my opinion i'm on neither's side, i dont reject the movie nor do i hate it, but neither do i adore it like many people do. I think it's an original, special, quirky movie with good performances and interesting screenwriting, but that's all it is.\nLike the crititics consensus states: Hal Ashby's comedy is too dark and twisted for some, and occasionally oversteps its bounds, but there's no denying the film's warm humor and big heart.\nWhich is something i fully concur with.\n\nI dont love Harold and Maude, nor do i hate it. I think it's fine entertainment, and it will go down in history that this is one of the most original movies in the ''unconventional friendships'' sub-genre.",

Harold is a wealthy young man who has an unhealthy fascination with suicide and death who falls in love with an eccentric 79 year old, Maude, who he meets at a funeral. Maude is a force of nature who cares little for the norms of society. She's flouts the law and creates a kind of carefree havoc wherever she goes. The strength of this movie are the two central performances by Bud Curt and Ruth Gordon who is especially enchanting. This is a likeable oddball comedy romance but there's not really much exploration of why Harold is the way he is which leaves a few too many questions.",

            "content": "A comedy cult classic with an off the wall premise, Harold and Maude sounded like a look into a different generation of comedy.\n\nHarold and Maude serves as Hal Ashby's contribution to the massive change cinematic history took in 1971. In a year where depictions of violence and sexuality were changed at the hands of such classics as The French Connection, A Clockwork Orange and Last Tango in Paris, Harold and Maude is an example far more tame in some areas and yet shocking in others. It is not difficult to determine where the innovations in Harold and Maude come from. Considering that the intro depicts its titular character Harold Chasen putting his neck in a noose and simulating suicide while his mother doesn't even flinch, the approach to death taken by Hal Ashby is one which is still very strange in the modern day. This is the first sign of Harold and Maude's most distinctive comedic style which proves to come from all kinds of unexpected directions over the course of the tale.\nThe story depicts a young man obsessed with death finding value in his existence through a developing relationship with a woman many decades older. Rather than having an old character learn from someone young, the roles are reversed for the sake of Harold and Maude which is a perfect use of the context in which it war produced. Coming from the counterculture era, Harold and Maude captures a time when contemporary society was condemned to an era of mistrust and nihilism which was heavily reflected in youth culture. To create a more positive sense of energy, the story looks back to a time when people fought through two world wars and still managed to come out with an optimistic look on life. The beautiful sense of life in the film and touching characters ensure that this feeling has been maintained in the decades since, ensuring that Harold and Maude has won the battle of age even if its humour is not precisely as shocking anymore.\nFor such an unconventional film, Harold and Maude is a very easy one to watch. Walking a sensible balance between dark comedy and sentimentality, Harold and Maude is a film about characters and not so much about story. Without attempting to be the most in-depth material, Harold and Maude is a film which lets everything naturally develop on its own so that the two titular characters are the primary focus of every source of the film's meanings, messages and humour. The story around Harold and Maude can be dull when it gets sidetracked away from the relationship between its titular characters, but it maintains enough focus to keep things entertaining and never overstays its welcome due to a meagre 91 minute running time.\nAs a romantic comedy, Harold and Maude is very removed from the conventions of the genre while diverting some of its familiar points into a more refreshing product. Since the plot focuses on the developing romantic relationship between a young man in his 20's and a 79 year old woman, it is the furthest thing from a familiar relationship depicted on film. Yet this concept is not wasted on strictly gags or taken too seriously. Unlike countless other romantic comedies, Harold and Maude is not a tale of cheesy interactions and dramatic conflicts between its main two characters, rather making an effort to be an existential drama amid such a zany plot. Hal Ashby walks a tricky line with this ambition and does not always hit his mark in achieving the most entertaining film, but the themes and subtext of Harold and Maude are always engaging while the unpredictable jokes of the film were a welcome surprise. Though Harold and Maude was a rather brief film, it did pose a lot of questions about love, life and death which left me thinking by the end of it after having some laughs along the way.\nOne of the most beautiful things about Harold and Maude is its soundtrack. In a similar style to Mike Nichols' The Graduate (1967), Harold and Maude has a soundtrack full of gentle acoustic pieces which set a somewhat bittersweet atmosphere consistently. As a fan of the BBC sitcom Extras (2005-2007), I was particularly favourable of Cat Stevens' contribution of the song \"Tea for the Tillerman\". The work of Cat Stevens on Harold and Maude is beautifully atmospheric and really captures the intended spirit of finding the natural beauty in life.\nAnd to reach out to the human side of viewers, Harold and Maude has a perfect cast.\nRuth Gordon takes on the role of Maude, a sweet old woman with a lot of wisdom to offer. In a brilliant contrast to her Academy Award winning role as the dark and twisted Minnie Castevet in Rosemary's Baby (1968), Dame Marjorie \"Maude\" Chardin is the most lovable and friendly character you could think of. Yet she is not a shallow archetype of sweetness, she is a genuinely intelligent and very likable character who is so packed with spirit that she transcends her physical age. This means viewers can easily get a sense as to why Harold Parker Chasen falls in love with her. There is a lot the character has to share with the world, and the fact that Ruth Gordon is the one responsible for bonding her with viewers everywhere is a perfect decision. Her free spirit is so admirable because it seems so real, and with Ruth Gordon seizing the role with the same passion Maude uses to sieze life to its fullest every day, the resulting character is brilliant. Ruth Gordon is a perfect lead for Harold and Maude who brings light into the dark nature of the film's beginning and ensures the story develops well enough so that the light shines out to viewers.\nBud Cort is also a brilliant cast member. Leading the film as Harold, Bud Cort is able to brilliantly capture the lost and hopeless nature of youth. It is something viewers can easily sympathize with because it is the kind of darkness many viewers have had to experience in life, as is the surrounding mystery of death. Bud Cort clearly knows the feeling all too well and provides a darkly comic character for the film whom he later develops as the dramatic material progresses. From there, he peels off layers of the character and shows viewers the tender soul underneath with raw and realistic emotion he gets from his interactions with Ruth Gordon. She manages to bring out the best in him and he really works to reach out to her, so the chemistry ends up being a strong two-way streak. Bud Cort embraces the dark comedy and serious drama of the story with no problem balancing the two, making the material seem all the more organic despite strange nature. Everything comes naturally to him which just goes to show the extent of his charms in the face of either comedy or drama, so Bud Cort shines out as a a memorable young star for Harold and Maude.\n\nSo Harold and Maude may be brief without having too much happen within its plot, but it is both funny and touching with an insightful script, brilliant performances and an unforgettable soundtrack.",

The idea of a wacky, exuberant free spirit woman bringing new life to a guy with emotional issues is hardly original ... and wasn't in 1971.  There were dozens of movies made around this same theme at the time.  The idea of the man being young and the woman being old was certainly original. but that's really where the originality stops.  Characters like Maude tend to confuse self-centered energy with a kid of life spirit, and she plays that way to me.  I don't believe that she ever really stops thinking about herself long enough to truly care about Harold, and the ending really confirms that feeling for me.",

Lovers (sickening thoughts were burrowed in my skull)? But this film was a surprise to what I had originally expected.\n\nThe part of what I liked about this film may have been its message. Beyond the affection the two have for one another, you can see Harold and Maude are stark opposites. Harold is depressing and death obsessed. Maude is all about living life to the fullest. While the message is hammered home quite a few times, it still is something that tends to slip the brain. The idea (to me) is to live life to its extent and to not ponder about death that often. Before Maude, Harold himself looked dead and non-responsive. Again, I have proven to myself that I am probably attached more to an interesting character than a story. I'm not death obsessed, but there are definitely times where I question why I live. There are times where I'm floating out there where I'm not me as Cat Stevens would probably put it (loved the music would probably buy a soundtrack to this film). \n\nThere's a point where Maude explains that everyone is individualistic like the daisies in a field, but people group themselves as being the same as each other when all the flowers are different/unique. Well, here's to becoming that individualist.",

After watching it, I can agree with both of these statements. Harold and Maude is a movie that is melancholic, hilarious, and happy all at the same time, and each part works together to make an unforgettable story. Balancing jokes about lighting yourself on fire, serious acknowledgement of the holocaust, and a cheerful soundtrack by Cat Stevens is no easy task, but this film does it expertly, mainly due to its large heart that it proudly wears on its sleeve. Similar to this balance, the tale told here is probably one of the best written in cinema. Lots of movies fall into the hole of having random twists show up out of nowhere or the equally dangerous trap of ignoring facts and throwing in new ones at the same time, but the script put out here leaps over those failings and delivers something both complex and simple, both in the best way. Almost everything that happens in the movie is foreshadowed or mentioned in some way, even a couple times in a seemingly throw away gag, and once you finish it you'll realize that what shocked you was coming a mile away, you just didn't realize the sings, much like the characters in the movie. If that's not a sign of good film making I don't know what is. In the end, while Hal Ashby could have take the easy way out and made an overly sentimental drama or a cruel comedy, he followed the road less traveled, crafting a gem that takes you through the ups and downs of life, and even after sadness leaves you with a smile on your face with an invaluable piece of knowledge. People, places, and things may come and go, but the lessons we learn from them and the moments we shared stay with us forever.",

            "content": "Harold and Maude (1971) is a film you will either site for changing your life, or you will go on for hours about how awful it was. There is seldom an in between. This is a film that is either inspiring or depressing, all depending completely on your own personal interpretation. Between the vague symbolism and the dramatic shifts between death imagery and life imagery, many are left unsure what to think. One thing is for sure, however: after watching Harold and Maude, you will be left shocked, and your overall opinion of this film will not be a quiet one. \n\tBud Cort plays the lanky, raven-haired, deep-voiced and baby-faced Harold Chasen. Discontented with his wealthy lifestyle, by the beginning of the film, Harold has committed suicide 15 times -- but that's just a \"rough estimate.\" \"And were they all for your mother's uh, benefit?\" Harold's shrink asks. The relationship between Harold and his mother is one that has been covered in fake blood and silicone limbs. The opening sequence of the film is that of Harold swinging from a noose, with his apathetic mother talking on the phone in front of him. This type of scenario is not uncommon, throughout this story she is commonly seen turning up \n\nher nose at, or just blissfully ignoring, Harold's staged suicides. \n\tWhen asked what he does for fun, Harold answers truthfully, \"I go to funerals.\" It is at one of these funerals that he meets a braid-wearing, free spirited seventy-nine year old woman named Dame Marjorie Charden (but you can call her Maude). Harold's first encounter with this strange old woman is brief, but soon she approaches him and offers him licorice. Their friendship only strengthens from there. He visits Maude's house repeatedly throughout the film, gazing at self portraits and drinking oat straw tea. Their relationship becomes much more than just friendship, however, to the dismay of Harold's family.\n\tA common criticism of Maude's character (played by the lovable and sassy Ruth Gordon) is that she is a \"manic pixie dream girl\" (a woman who enters a film for the sole purpose of benefitting the male character). While this is ultimately true, I don't believe the concept of Maude's character to be quite that shallow. Maude is a meaningful and thought provoking character. A close look at her character would tell the viewer that she has been controlled by the possibility of death her whole life, and now wants to live life to the fullest. \"Everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves sometimes. You can't let the world judge you too much!\" she jokes in one scene. Maude is certainly no side character, and to write her off as such, would be to miss the point of the film completely. \n\tThis film is exceptionally cast. The portrayal of Harold's character is absolutely spot-on, and I genuinely believe that not a single other person in this world could have done it better. Cort delivers every witty punch line with a dead straight face and a signature deep monotonous voice. Even when breaking the fourth wall, it doesn't at all come across as cheesy or unnecessary. This isn't at all like his previous film Brewster McCloud, where his character seems void of a personality and any depth whatsoever. Cort has never played a character better suited for his acting skill! By the end of Harold and Maude, you will begin to believe that he truly is Harold Chasen.\n\tMy own personal favorite aspect of the movie is the symbolism, often completely missed by viewers. The symbolism can completely change the meaning of the film from a dark comedy about a strange relationship, to a film about existentialism and living life to the fullest. Each moment in the movie is a necessary one, and every last detail has been clearly thought out. Everything from the color of the umbrellas at a funeral, to the flowers in the cemetery, to a seemingly random marching band, means something incredibly deep. Be careful not to blink -- everything in this film is some form of foreshadowing. Expect to need to watch it a few times. \n\tOne scene in particular is rich with symbolism and in many ways, summarizes the entire movie. Both Maude and Harold are sitting amongst a field of flowers near a cemetery (live versus death imagery). Maude tells Harold that she would like to be a sunflower. \"They're so tall and simple. What flower would you like to be, Harold?\" she asks. Harold replies that he would like to be a daisy because they're supposedly all the same. Maude seems concerned with his reply. \"Oh but they're not [all the same]! See, some are taller, some are fatter. Some go to the left, some to the right. Some are even missing some petals! All kind of observable differences. You see, I feel much of the world's sorrow comes from people who are this, but allow themselves to be treated as that!\" Maude says. This scene speaks to me on many levels, and never ceases to inspire me endlessly.\n\tI am not the only one who has been inspired by Harold and Maude. My first experience with this film was through a 'History of the Motion Picture' class in high school. The teacher of this class introduced the film as his \"all-time favorite piece of cinema\" and continued to tell us about how this film alone inspired him to get up and leave for New Zealand, and hitch hike for months. This film is a life-changer; no exaggeration necessary.\n\tUnfortunately this film is seldom shown in theaters. Even less often are DVDs sold in stores. In order to purchase or rent this film, you must seek online sources. However, undoubtedly, Harold and Maude is worth every penny you will pay, and the time you will wait for shipping and handling.\n\tFrom the exceptional and thought provoking symbolism, to the unexpected plot, and the perfect cast, this movie is absolutely the best film I have seen. Harold and Maude means so much to so many people around the world. I believe the word \"perfect\" to be a very strong word, but I am confident that Harold and Maude is truly a piece of perfect cinema. If it doesn't haunt the back of your mind for weeks, or completely change your life, you might just need to watch it again... and again, and again.",

The main messages were wonderful-Live life to the fullest, embrace ur uniqueness, and love who u want to. That police chase scene was comedic genius! I just loved Maudes character who was such a breath of fresh air in a sea of young cookie cutter beautiful actresses. Hello Hollywood casting agents: more Maudes and less bimbos please. She didn't need plastic surgery to showcase her youthfulness or beauty. Why aren't there more roles like this for women? Maudes acting was impeccable. Def recommend this movie!",

The romance between Harold and Maude is unconventional to say the least, but the love between the two characters feels real. This is story that touches upon the demand to conform to societal conventions, and the happiness that comes out of resisting that expectation. I love the pacing of this film; the characters are given time not only to express their self, but also to listen, and contemplate, and generate only answers that are authentic and well thought out. I think this film has aged well, and I think it offers a window into the nostalgic fantasy before the complexities of instant communication and social media that we have today. I actually felt really relaxed in watching this. It's funny, eclectic, heart-warming, while at the same time holding up a mirror to society and asking the question: why is there such taboo with being different?",

I could easily relate to Harolds lack of interest in his mothers affairs (not of a romantic nature, I should clarify)This film did give me quite a wry smile, although it rarely made me laugh out loud, as such - maybe only a couple of times. I could easily relate to Harolds lack of interest in his mothers affairs (not of a romantic nature, I should clarify) - the other characters he interacts with all come across as very much self centered/absorbed and very predictable. He appears to be somewhat of a stoney faced, ghost like figure as he's pushed into the background and yet his mother doesn't appear to know what to do with him because I suppose he isn't the model child that parents hope, or presume, their kid(s) will somehow naturally be.It has something of a life affirming element to it, when Harold and Maude are together and sort of allow themselves to be themselves and to heck with what other people think about their rather impulsive, erratic and eccentric behaviour. They make for an interesting double act of sorts, given he's a young adult (presumably a teenager) and she's an elderly lady - Maude exclaims at one point that spending time with him takes her back to her school days. Some of the dialogue is poignant, although perhaps a bit sugary sweet for some maybe - I suppose its a slightly strange mix to have such dark comedy/humour with the (somewhat) graphic, staged depictions of suicides, alongside talk about seizing life, making the most of life and so on. I feel there's definitely a class element very much at play here too, given Harold lives in a rather large, mansion style house with a clearly very upper class mother. When he's given an introduction to the military, in the hopes he'll somehow 'make a man of himself', things don't go to plan and seeing the flustered reaction of the General was quite amusing. There's something almost reassuring, in a sense, about the fact that well regarded professionals seem baffled by Harold and the person who seemingly 'gets him' is someone who, to all intents and purposes, is also not looked on well and is overlooked by others.This is a very quirky film which some may well feel is a bit distasteful and thus won't necessarily sit well with some - you may find it quite amusing in parts, or you may struggle to understand what the point is, its hard to say. I can certainly understand why its regarded as a cult film, as its got quite an 'indie' feel to it and its clearly quite original, in terms of the story - I don't feel like ive come across many, if any, characters quite like Harold, somehow. By the end of the flm, I couldn't help but wonder what became of this person - if it were a real depiction of someone, where did they end up?. I think there is a thought provoking element to it - its quite care free and light hearted while also tackling (if in a slightly strange way, maybe) some heavy subjects, that of belonging, acknowledgment and even mortality.I found the film to be perfectly watchable, it isn't an especially long watch at about an hour and a half running time. Its one of those quirky films where you feel, as a viewer, as if your without some perhaps key information which might make you understand things a bit better but it actually benefits from this, I feel. We learn a bit more about Harold as the film progresses and there's a real plot twist towards the end, one that particularly took me aback as it seemed to go against what I thought I knew of the person involved. I think this film somehow affirms that you don't always know goes on in peoples minds. I think this film wouldn't work, or certainly not anything like as well as it did, if it weren't for the main performances of Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort, as Maude and Harold respectively. They both come across as intriguing, eccentric characters and its quite nice to see how they both seem to open up to one another after spending time with each other. It is an interesting character driven film, if a little dark and perhaps not fast enough paced plot wise for some, maybe.Yes I'd recommend this film in as much as I quite enjoyed watching it and got a laugh or two out of it, although I'd make it clear that it won't be for everyone and indeed some may find it distasteful. Its hard to describe without showing it but it is quite a dark film wth an 'indie' feel to it and fans of such films, or those especially curious about the themes would likely enjoy it, I'd imagine.",
