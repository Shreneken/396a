            "content": "I know people have complained about the length of this movie. Yeah, it is long, three hours approximately, but there are so many things that compensate. Norman Jewison's direction is very good, and the film is stylishly filmed, with some nice cinematography and there are nice scenery and costumes. The choreography is great, energetic in parts and graceful in others. Next, the music is outstanding. The incidental music largely reminiscent of Russian folk music is a real treat, but the songs are outstanding. The beautiful \"Sunrise, Sunset\", the fun \"Tradition\", the idealistic \"Match Maker\" and the energetic \"If I Were A Rich Man\", all amazing. Also, Topol, what an absolutely brilliant performance. He put body and soul into Tevye, successfully mixing humour, wisdom and poignancy and the result is one of the most memorable performances in any musical to grace our screens. All the other performances are wonderful, I liked it all five daughters had distinct personalities, and Norma Crane is fantastic as the mother. The story is both tight and poignant, about a milkman of Jewish values, who wishes his five daughters to marry. In conclusion, wonderful and definitely memorable. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Opening with the wonderful song \"Tradition\" which is the overriding theme of the entire musical, with its comedy and its pain, this film is a charming, sentimental telling of the lives and tribulations of a family. The beauty of it is that despite occasional violence against a people, they maintain their spirit through the ages. It's about what every father believes, \"There is no one adequate to marry my daughter.\" Things happen and people get knocked down, and eventually everyone gets to his feet once more. There is the combative relationship between Tevye and his wife, and their love (\"but do you love me\") that goes pretty much unstated. In the end they continue to stand tall together because what they have put into the world is true love, not the overly dramatic, silly love that permeates our world today. See the movie. See the stage play. You will always leave with an optimistic spring in your step, and wonderful songs in your heart.",

            "content": "Epic in plot, setting and length, Fiddler on the Roof tells a surprisingly tight and focused story that has \"universal\" poignancy--in a nutshell, it's about trying to maintain strong cultural traditions and identity in the face of a continually changing world, partially fueled by the youth, that doesn't necessarily share the culture's values or self-assessment of worth.The plot is based on short stories written around the turn of the 20th Century by Sholom Aleichem, who was often called the \"Russian Mark Twain\". Aleichem wrote a number of works based on his character Tevye the Milkman, who has seven daughters (in the film, this was pared down to five). They live in the fictional Jewish shtetl (\"village\", or \"little town or city\") of Anatevka in Tsarist Russia in the early 1900s. The stories are \"slice of life\" stuff. A lot of attention is paid to Tevye's daughters and their potential suitors. One of the prominent conflicts with tradition is a struggle with arranged marriages versus marriages for love, but of course, being set in pre-revolutionary Russia, there are also political changes brewing, some of which have a profound affect on Tevye's family and village.Aleichem's Tevye stories were first turned into a Broadway musical, which began its initial run in 1964 with Zero Mostel as Tevye. Producer and director Norman Jewison, who had had success with films like In the Heat of the Night (1967) and The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), and who was experienced as a producer and director for musical-oriented televisions shows, including \"Your Hit Parade\" (1950) and \"The Judy Garland Show\" (1960), was asked around early 1970 by United Artists to helm the Fiddler on the Roof film. To their surprise, Jewison wasn't Jewish. He got the gig anyway, and in August 1970, began an arduous shoot--much of it done in a small village in Yugoslavia that refused to cooperate when it came to weather (Jewison couldn't get the snow he wanted). He ended up getting a lot of pressure because the shoot went over time and over budget--this was one of the most expensive films of its time, which was an era of economic woes for Hollywood--but of course we know it paid off in the end.Zero Mostel was out as Tevye, and Israeli actor Chaim Topol, or just \"Topol\", was in, based largely on Jewison seeing him in the role of Tevye in the London stage production of Fiddler. Jewison had said that he was shooting for more realism in the film, as opposed to what he saw as a kind of campy humor in the Broadway production.In my eyes, Jewison ended up with a bit of both approaches in his finished film, but that's all for the better. Sequences like the opening \"Tradition\" montage are hilarious in their juxtaposition of a grand operatic attitude and the rhythmic coordination of cleaning fish, hanging slabs of meat, and so on. Yes, a lot of Fiddler is very realistic, but it's equally humorous and surrealistic most of the time.The realism is largely thanks to the authentic settings, the fabulous production and costume design, and of course, the superb performances. The humor is a factor of the above with that Mark Twain-ish aspect of Aleichem's stories and the fine script by Joseph Stine.The surrealism comes largely by way of the cinematography. Some of the visual sense is reminiscent of Marc Chagall's early work and his later, nostalgic depictions of his native Russia, and in fact, the image of the fiddler on the roof comes directly from a Chagall painting. Jewison saw the fiddler as a cross between a metaphor for the Jewish spirit (and this is explained in more detail via a few lines of dialogue in the film) and an actual physical manifestation of a spirit. However we interpret the fiddler, the shots of him and his presence in the film are certainly poetic. Jewison also gives us some fabulous, surreal, wide landscape shots, such as those of agricultural fields and the beautiful \"wasteland\" in which the train tracks are set. There are a few scenes set on the banks of a river, overlooked by a bridge, that are reminiscent of particular Van Gogh paintings. And as a more subtle bit of surrealism, Jewison had cinematographer Oswald Morris shoot much of the film though a woman's stocking--the mesh is very clearly visible in some exterior shots. Of course, there are also a couple more surrealistic touches in the plot, my favorite being the Tevye's Dream sequence, which features traditionalist Jewish zombies in an operatic attitude.A musical couldn't be a 10 without great music, and Fiddler on the Roof has it. The songs are a marvelous melding of traditional Russian folk melodies, with appropriate twinges of Orientalism and the expected Broadway sound, but maybe leaning a bit closer to a modern opera. From that description, you might think that the music would be a mess, but all of the songs are inventive and catchy. They are seamlessly melded with the drama, furthering the narrative as they should. The choreography is excellent and it is well shot by Jewison. And Isaac Stern's violin solos are outstanding, of course.Fiddler on the Roof takes an investment of time--it's three hours long, but it's well worth it. It offers great drama, great music, great humor and great tragedy in a beautiful package--you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll sing, and you just might break a leg trying to dance.",

'Fiddler on the Roof' is about a soft-hearted father and his self awakening to a \"new tradition\" which he experiences with his three eldest daughters whose actions call for reform...'Fiddler on the Roof' is a powerful statement about the evils of prejudice and the importance of maintaining a warm and communicative family life in the midst of severe oppression...'Fiddler on the Roof' is about traditional values at a time, like today, when there is confusion over those values...'Fiddler on the Roof' is about love and fear, devotion and defiance, persecution and poverty, pride and dignity, sorrow and oppression...'Fiddler on the Roof' takes place in the midst of a hostile and chaotic environment... 'Fiddler on the Roof' could be safely placed in the great tradition of film musicals... The songs evoke happiness and tears... The fiddler's hauntingly beautiful music came from the violin of the world's greatest virtuosos, Isaac Stern... Composer Jerry Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick captured the drama and conflict of the story from its incisive opening to, ultimately, the powerfully silent human circle at the very end... Their treatment of the music produced some outstanding hits like 'Tradition.' 'Tradition' is more than a simple musical number... The brilliance of this song is in its ability to introduce the impoverished village and its characters \u0096 from the figure of the funny fiddler to the pathos and witty humor of Tevye, to the creaky old rabbi, to the bright-eyed matchmaker, to the sharp-tongued Golde, to the indecisive tailor, to the audacious revolutionary, to the enthusiastic butcher, to the Constable who brings that terrible order \u0096 It is the solid center of the film.. Yet one by one, the traditions that the very poor dairyman of Anatevka and his people have cherished and lived are broken during the course of the film, as marriage are no longer arranged by the 'papa,' as men and women dance together in a public place, and, most grievous of all, as children marry out of their faith... The shattering of these traditions becomes even more intolerable to Tevye in the shadow of other dangerous forces which threaten to destroy the very life he is trying to preserve...Under Norman Jewison's direction, the entire cast delivers a depth performance and a spectacular energy that brought smiles and tears to the audience... Few musical characters are so fully realized or so deeply engaging...Topol warms hearts and evokes laughter with his deep humanity, wisdom and humor... He brings his own magnetism and appropriate world-weariness to the role... With his raspy voice, virile appearance, and alternating expressions of compassion and implacability, he reveals his thoughts to the audience, always quoting \"the good book.\" He even shakes a czarist soldier's finger rather than his hand, and questions his loyal wife after 25 years of marriage on whether or not she loves him...Norma Crane brings out a concerned mother and a devout Jewish woman...Molly Picon shines as the garrulous Yente, the village matchmaker who fails to arrange suitable marriages for the three strong-willed daughters...Rosalind Harris makes her plain Tzeitel somehow beautiful... She defies 'Tradition' to marry for love rather than arrangement...Michele Marsh is Tevye's second daughter, Hodel, the decisive young girl who follows an activist against the repressive regime...Neva Small is both radiant and pathetic as the delicate middle daughter Chava, who unbelievably chooses love over family...Leonard Frey is Motel, the young impecunious tailor who tells Tevye that he and Tzeitel had made each other a pledge...Paul Michael Glaser is Perchik, the radical student from Kiev with liberal ideas, who asks Tevye's blessing, not his permission...Zvee Scooler is the beloved Rabbi who offers this prayer for the Czar: \"May God keep the Tsar...far away from us!\"Nominated for eight Academy Awards, 'Fiddler of the Roof' proves to be a splendid achievement with its strongly emotional songs that grows out of the characters' feelings...",

            "content": "The range and audacity of `Fiddler on the Roof' is stunning.  By comparison today's musicals are timid, quaking things, terrified of frightening their audiences away however much `social relevance' bravado they may assume. This old musical is older than it looks.  The film dates from 1971; the musical itself from 1963; but even then it was clear that it was the last of its kind, a delayed swan-song from the 1950s.  There's sentiment, but no promise of a happy ending; humour, but not a trace of postmodern knowingness; realism, but and a willingness to indulge in fantasy, too. Musicals can't really survive without fantasy, and `Fiddler', along with `West Side Story', may very well mark the limit of just how serious it is possible to get without losing it.  The songs are uniformly good.  I don't know if Bock's music was usually so fitting, or if he happened to strike gold just once - not that it matters.As for the film ... I only wish I'll get a chance to see it in a cinema, for the photography is beautiful - and it IS the photography that's doing it, since we're made to realise that neither the village nor its setting is picturesque in itself.  Norman Jewison has assembled a cast not one member of which jars and makes the most of it.  This film is quite long, and feels longer, but neither length nor apparent length is a liability.",

I always felt like this film (and \"Yentl\") were marketed towards the Jewish community, but it need not be. It is just a great story with excellent songs.I loved the singing, the dancing, the story, the humor, the characters... there was really nothing I disliked about it.

Among the traditions of the Jewish community, the matchmaker arranges the match and the father approves it. The milkman Reb Tevye (Topol)is a poor man that has been married for twenty-five years with Golde (Norma Crane) and they have five daughters. When the local matchmaker Yente (Molly Picon) arranges the match between his older daughter Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris) and the old widow butcher Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann), Tevye agrees with the wedding. However Tzeitel is in love with the poor tailor Motel Kazoil (Leonard Frey) and they ask permission to Tevye to get married that accepts to please his daughter. Then his second daughter Hodel (Michele Marsh) and the revolutionary student Perchik (Michael Glaser) decide to marry each other and Tevye is forced to accept. When Perchik is arrested by the Czar troops and sent to Siberia, Hodel decides to leave her family and homeland and travel to Siberia to be with her beloved Perchik.When his third daughter Chaveleh (Neva Small) decides to get married with the Christian Fyedka (Raymond Lovelock), Tevye does not accept and considers that Chava has died. Meanwhile the Czar troops evict the Jewish community from Anatevka.\"Fiedler on the Roof\" is a wonderful musical for the whole family about Jewish tradition and the new world. The performances are top-notch and this film has been nominated and won several awards, including Best Cinematography, Best Music Scoring Adaptation and Original Song Score and Best Sound. The songs are magnificent and my favorite is \"Sunrise Sunset\" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLLEBAQLZ3Q). The sequence when Tevye asks Golde whether she loves him or not is delightful. Despite the 181 minutes running time with Intermission, the viewer does not fell the time passing by in this marvelous film.

Topol's portrayal has an earthiness to it that makes the farmer/milkman feel authentic. When he pushes his awkward cart through the landscape, you can feel his exhaustion.Jewison also does a great job integrating the music into the action. Songs like \"Do You Love Me?\" and \"Sunrise, Sunset\" spring organically from the action. The film's themes are universal in nature. Even in his small village, Tevye cannot avoid a changing world. It challenges his beliefs and threatens his beloved traditions. Eventually, it changes every aspect of his life. Finally, he realizes that what his daughter says to him is true--home is where your love is.Virtually every aspect of this film is excellent, from the dancing to the cinematography.

            "content": "I saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it many times since. I am not especially a fan of musicals and there are very few that I like but this is one of those few. Fiddler on the Roof ran on Broadway from 1964 to 1972 and received a special Tony Award in 1972 for being the longest running musical in Braodway history. In addition it was nominated for nine Tony Awards for 1965 winning eight of them. The popularity of the plays Broadway run spawned Off Broadway performances worldwide from professional theater companies to high school productions. Joseph Stein wrote the screenplay for the filmed version adapted from his book which was based on stories by Sholom Aleichem. The wonderful music of Fiddler on the Roof is from the songwriting team of composer Jerry Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick. Director Norman Jewison had never done a musical before and was best known for the drama In the Heat of the Night and the comedies The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming and The Art of Love. He would direct another musical after Fiddler in Jesus Christ Superstar but would find more success in Moonstruck, A Soldier's Story and ..And Justice For All. Veterna Cinematographer Oswald Morris who was familiar with musicals having photographed Scrooge and Oliver was known for his cinematography in such films as Lolita, Mobey Dick, Goodbye Mr. Chips and The Guns of Navarone. the film Fiddler on the Roof was immediately embraced b the public and received critical acclaim and received eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Director and won three Oscars for Best Cinematography, Musical Score and Sound. the film's setting takes place in the Jewish village of Anatevka, Russia in the year 1905. I interviewed a 101 year old Jewish woman three years ago who was born in a small village outside of Minsk, Russia in 1902 and lived there until 1920. In asking her to describe her village she referred to this film and said it was exactly like what was depicted in the movie. I can't think of a better testament to the production of this film than having someone who lived in a similar village during the time it was set in to see her past in this film. At three hours this runs a little long and it's hard to capture a successful musical stage play on film but this comes as close as you can get. As a musical I would give this a 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Anti-Semitism has been an issue of the world for millenniums, and as one character here describes the life of a Jew, \"Our fore-fathers have been kicked out of many places.\" \"Maybe that's why we always wear our hats\", Topol's Tevye gently replies, a touch of irony hidden behind his wisecrack. Tevye is a poor man, but he is a man of the world who understands humanity, both Jewish and Gentile, and he has no issue of socializing on occasion with the Gentile Russians he is surrounded by. He longs to help keep the peace, and for good reason: He has eight daughters who must find good husbands, and a tough wife who keeps him in line. It's all about \"Tradition!\", though, and Tevye is having a difficult time in accepting the changing times, especially the independence his three oldest daughters throw his way as his ideals of traditional matchmaking are thrown out of the window.Wife Golde (Norma Crane) surprises him with the news that Yente the Matchmaker (Molly Picon) has come up with a match for their oldest daughter, Tzeitel. It's Lazar Wolfe, the widowed butcher, a man Tevye despises, but after downing a few shots thanks to the rich Lazar, Tevye is convinced that he'll be perfect for the namesake of Golde's beloved grandmother. What he doesn't count on is the fact that Tzeitel and the two daughters next in line all have their own ideas as to what makes a perfect match, and after the rousing \"To Life!\", Tevye learns the truth when he breaks the news to the love-lorn Tzeitel. Leonard Frey, who had a small role in the original Broadway production, takes over the role of the tailor Motel Kamzoil and sings the beautiful love song \"Miracle of Miracles\", showing a lot of heart and life in this presumably straight-laced young man.From there, the two other daughters show their own rebellion, and Tevye's frustration grows. Topol is outstanding as Tevye's traditions are threatened but he finds conflict in his own heart because of his great love for his daughters. He must then confront his own past with Golde, an arranged marriage which introduced them on their own wedding day. While Golde is a bit hard on the surface, you know she is filled with love, at first obvious for her daughters, and even more begrudgingly later for the husband she was seemingly forced to spend the rest of her life dedicated to serving him. \"Barking at the servants day and night!\", Tevye sings in the show-stopping \"If I Were a Rich Man\", describing his seemingly harpy wife who has more dimensions than meets the eye.Molly Picon is adorable as Yente the Matchmaker, and as in everything she ever did on screen, she makes you just want to hug her, even if she is a bit of an unromantic in the way she manipulates every young person's love life. The shot of her at a wedding during the profound \"Sunrise, Sunset\" is truly revealing as she too can't deny the power of young love, even if it potentially means the end of her life-long profession. Then, there's \"Tevye's Dream\", the fantasy sequence where Tevye must convince Golde that Lazar Wolfe is not the right match for their daughter. Extremely lavish and slightly camp (especially with the vision of Lazar's late wife Fruma Sarah), it is both a comical and scary nightmare, like something out of a British Hammer horror film.The long Broadway run featured many Tevye's (most famously the original, Zero Mostel), and Topol, who headlined the British production, is outstanding in every sense. It has been revived many times on Broadway, most recently as 2003 (for a two-year run), and will soon celebrate its 50th Anniversary. The wonderfully sentimental and witty lyrics of Sheldon Harnick (still around as of this writing at the spry age of 90!) and the gorgeous score by Jerry Bock surround a brilliant book, and the production values on this movie are simply breathtaking. Director Norman Jewison and his crew provide many details into the traditions of the Russian Jews of this era that are simple for us Gentiles to catch onto, and you may find yourself engulfed in the culture of these passionate people who would find even more serious struggles in the decades to come. Books on this history of this show and movie give more detail as to the meanings of certain words and phrases, and open the eyes of us who want to reach beyond our own lives and embrace the different cultures of the world.

            "content": "Although I'm not normally a great fan of musicals...people on the screen constantly bursting into song for no good reason generally irritate me...this one's a masterpiece. Story, theme, characters (especially the main one, Tevye), and of course, incomparable music.This musical is set in the Russian village of Anatevka during the early 1900's of the Tsarist regime. It tells the story of the village's Jewish inhabitants (Tevye's family, in particular), their traditions (and the disturbing trend toward departing from them), their hardships and persecutions, and most of all their optimism, camaraderie, humor, and especially faith in God through it all.Topol is magnificent as the main character, Tevye, the village milkman, who imparts to anyone who'll listen his pearls of wisdom from the Good Book and has conversations aloud (sometimes musical ones) with God, complaining good naturedly about his troubles and of course the importance of maintaining, yes... TRADITION. He's the father of five daughters and much of the story line revolves around the older three, who reject the old customs of the Matchmaker, Yente, and insist on choosing their own most unsuitable husbands... Tzeitel, who prefers the poor, shy, awkward but endearing tailor, Motel, to the much older, wealthy, ruddy faced butcher (Lazar Wolf) selected for her by her father; Hodel, who chooses a student activist, Perchik, even if it means exile in Siberia; and Chava, who defies her father by marrying a Gentile, Fyedka, in an Orthodox Christian Church. Teyve loves his daughters and always tries to see their choices from the alternate, optimistic side (\"on the other hand\"...), but some traditions are too difficult to see broken. The issue of Judaism notwithstanding, like all parents of faith even today, Tevye finds it much easier to deal with his son-in-law's economic or political unsuitability than with major religious differences.My personal favorite scenes are of Tzeitel's wedding...the magnificent cinematography, the beautiful candle lit procession, the solemnity of the sacred marriage vows under the Jewish canopy, the bride supposedly plain but absolutely radiant, the traditional breaking of the wine glass by the groom, all to the moving strains (tears fill my eyes even now) of the immortal \"Sunrise, Sunset\" which asks the timeless question of every parent at their offspring's wedding...where has the time gone? how did my child grow up so quickly?This film touchingly depicts the close knit village life (where everyone knows everyone else's business) but especially in relation to the threatening external forces, the pogroms of Pre Revolutionary Russia. Racial prejudice against these Jewish villagers is an ongoing theme, and nowhere is this more dramatically and touchingly revealed than at Tzeitel's wedding reception. I won't give away the details, but your emotional response will be outrage. It's a picture that's worth a thousand words. Lots of humor, too, especially in the interactions between Tevye and his devout, long-suffering wife, Golde. Now, this is a couple that knows the true meaning of love. For me, the funniest scene in this movie was the sewing machine, absolutely precious. Wonderful music of course throughout. The \"fiddler on the roof\" plays his hauntingly beautiful strains, especially effective during the moving, emotional ending. All the songs in this picture are catchy but, unlike most ditsy musicals, also have deep meaning. Everyone seeing this movie at the theatre left humming the incomparable, lively \"If I Were a Rich Man\".

On the contrary, as a straight WASP, the last thing I want to watch is a broadway musical or a bunch of Jews 'kavetching' about how bad they have it. That is definitely NOT what this film is about.  Though the subject matter is Jewish, to say it is a Jewish film would grossly limit it's significance. It is about the human experience.  Any one who has felt pain and persecution will relate to it.  Therefore I say every human should love this film.  It has an indomitable optimism and remarkable pathos that causes the viewer to empathize with the characters, namely Reb Tevye, played by Topol in arguably one of the finest dramatic performances ever.  Considering the lack of success Topol has had with the rest of his career it would literally seem he was born to play this part. This film will most likely not be enjoyable for those looking for spoon fed, mindless entertainment or titillation, but for anyone who appreciates the beautiful things in life, it is high art. I recommend you set aside an undisturbed block of time, (use the can first, it's three hours long) when you are feeling relaxed, eat some good homemade soup and watch this masterpiece.  Perfect casting, cinematography, pacing, art direction, wardrobe and best of all, an exquisite soundtrack by the great, and very young, John Williams.  Listen to this movie on a powerful sound system and it will sweep you into each musical number.  Especially (my favorite) the bar room dance scene.  Fiddler on the Roof should be on every top 100 list that exists.   Like no other movie I can think of, 'Fiddler' reaches deep into the heart and begs one to look at what things in life are worth living for and dying for.",

            "content": "...\"Fiddler on the Roof\" stars Topol as Tevye, a Jewish milk man (and father of five) living in a small town in the time before WWII.  The movie follows him over a long period of his life, mostly focusing on his three oldest daughters getting married, and Tevy's opposition towards their new husbands. Of course, it sounds a little depressing, but believe me, when you here the song \"If I Were A Rich Man\", you'll change your mind.Musicals tend to become boring about halfway through (or at the beginning if they're really bad) because of overly dramatic songs or over acting. \"Fiddler on the Roof\" doesn't fall into this category.  The songs please and warm your heart whenever they are sung, and the characters don't either overact or become boring.Topol is hilarious and dramatic as Tevye, the dancing and singing father who speaks to God (and the audience) out loud.  Topol narrates, sings, dances, and mingles joyfully with the other characters, never even coming close to slipping out of character.  Tevye will go down in my book as one of the most memorable protagonists...ever.The only thing going against \"Fiddler on the Roof\" is its monstrous running time.  Not because it gets boring, but because whenever you'd like to watch it, you have to make sure you have about four hours of spare time, 9/10.",

(And I'm not the sentimental type!)  It honestly depicts what it means to be human.  It contains love, faith, family, friendship, humour, violence, hate, prejudice, change, vulnerability, joy, community, anger...everything.  This film is a tribute to the Jewish people, but you don't have to be Jewish to enjoy it.  It's so rich that everyone can identify with it, and learn from it.As for the music, all the songs fit in naturally and stand on their own as classics.  \"Matchmaker, Matchmaker,\" \"Sunrise, Sunset,\" \"If I Were A Rich Man\" - need I say more?  When Hodel sings \"Far From the Home I Love\" it's tissue time.  They're all so beautiful!  If you usually find it hard to take when characters in musicals suddenly burst into song, don't worry, in this film it's so seamless you can't imagine them communicating any other way. The music makes it easier for them to say things they normally wouldn't in conversation.The characters are so real and down-to-earth. They're strong, hard-working people, who have their priorities straight. I can't write about FOTR without mentioning Tevye - the centre of this whirling story, and a man who, like all of us, struggles with the pace with which his world is changing.  He clings to the past, yet accepts what the future may bring. I don't think there is another film out there that addresses how insecure we feel with change. But hey, that's life. \"To life, to life, la chayim!!\"",

            "content": "*** SPOILERS ***This is a truly great movie that happens to be a musical.  As with any great movie, it is a product that geometrically multiplies the visions and talents of its Director (Norman Jewison) by combining and extracting the best of the talents of his cast together with his technical crew members. \nAs a written play, Fiddler On The Roof, was based on a script that was a true labor of love attempting to extract the best pearls of wit and wisdom from the remarkably rich legacy of humorist-essayist-philosopher Sholom Alechem. The superb musical play was heavy on wit and magnificently composed and choreographed musical numbers capturing-to-a-tee Alechem's spirit and indomitable drollery.  It had steep roots in the Yiddish theater and a perfect musical-comedy farceur to capture that spirit in Zero Mostel.Four years after winning the Oscar for the magnificent \"In The Heat of The Night\", Norman Jewison, a Canadian Christian, had the gall (in many eyes) to attempt to extract still more from his movie.  Rather than embrace the play's Yiddish theater roots, Jewison's movie is more about using Alechem's anecdotes and the brilliant music to capture the essence of the Russian town that Anatevka was at the turn of the century, replete with its distinctly rich Eastern European roots.  In order to do this, he made the bold, albeit unpopular choice, of eschewing Mostel and his New York roots for 33-years-young Israeli actor Chaim Topol who was a smash in the role on London's West End.  This still-controversial choice turned many off and distracted from the movie itself.  This is a pity because I found Topol's performance astounding and at the core of what I personally consider the strongest and deepest movie musical ever made.At its core, the movie version of Fiddler On The Roof focuses on the story of Anatevka first, using the trials and tribulations of Teyve the milkman and his family saga as a mirror to capture what is happening to the town, and as one of the characters notes to Jewish villages like it all over Russia.  As such, this is the story of the unconquerable faith and basic dignity and humility of Job, extended not just to Teyve, not just to Anatevka, but to all the Russian Jews of that era who were forced to flee the homes they loved.  Jewison captures the core and the essential truths of that unconquerable faith coupled with the overwhelming dignity demonstrated by these survivors continuing to smile and persist in humble faith even as their oppressors try to kick their teeth in.To me, one of the most illustrative exchanges is when Motel (Teyve's eldest son-in-law) reflects, \"We always wait for the Messiah.  Wouldn't this be the perfect time for him to come?\"  Sympathetically but bemusedly, the Rabbi replies, \"Of course we shall continue to wait for the Messiah.  We will just have to wait for him somewhere else!\" All at once, the drama, wit, irony, pathos, faith and essential spirit of Teyve's family and the village leave its indelible imprint on our brains.  Jewison not only captures genuinely and unforgettably all the emotions and essential truths of Anatevka and the 3,000-year legacy it embodies, but creates a vital new legacy as its now inseparable companion.  Yet, at the same time that the heartwrenching story of the oppression and exile of the Jews is evoked, and the indomitable spirit that keeps the culture and religion going is reinforced yet again, it is brought forth in a manner that allows non-Jews to share in the emotions and spirit as well.Since I've given such a long review to a movie and story of great length already and have barely touched upon its many specific gems, I'll endeavor to be brief.  Norma Crane, Rosalind Harris, Leonard Frey, Paul Mann, Louis Zorich (later of Brooklyn Bridge), the female actor playing Chava, the \"Greek Chorus of Jewish townspeople\" Zev Schooler, and Molly Picon (the last two being Jewison's concession to the plays Yiddish theater roots) are all outstanding and unforgettable in their roles. The score (yes three good songs were necessarily omitted -- how much longer than 3 hours would you like the movie to run?) is beautifully sung and played, with the instrumentals simply stunning.  The choreography on the Bottle Dance is a standout.  The art direction, sound editing, camera angles, stunning photography, contrasts, virtually every technical aspect of the movie I can name -- and I mean EVERY one -- is magnificently executed to augment Jewison's vision to perfection.[As nothing is 100% perfect, I'll pick two minor nits -- unlike others, I thought Glaser missed the essence of Perchik's scholarly radical by half-an-octave and I thought the beautiful and talented Michele Marsh did not look physically like she belonged in that family.  There I said it.  OK, big deal, they were still more than good enough.]   I generally loathe movies of more than two-and-one-half hours in length. Fiddler On The Roof and A Man For All Seasons are my two most notable exceptions.  If you enjoy movies made before 1980 at all, and have any sense of the essential spirit of mankind and what the human race is about, you owe it to yourself to see this extraordinary opus -- a true masterpiece that only adds to its relevance with the passage of time. 11/10.",

            "content": "Based on the Broadway musical, the story takes place in a small Jewish community in a rural area of Tsarist Russia. Tevye (Chaim Topol) is a poor milkman with five daughters, three of whom are reaching adulthood. He has difficulty with the more modern attitudes of his daughters while the community faces danger from the lingering anti-Semitism from outside.Director Norman Jewison has done a superb job with this beautiful film which is exquisitely photographed by Oswald Morris. The camera movements as well as the framing of each scene perfectly add to the emotions generated by the story and, of course, those great songs by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick. Jewison also shows great skill with crowd scenes.The first half of this three-hour film has musical numbers that are boisterous and breathtaking. The best include \"Tradition\" (with a superb montage that reflect the community's working and religious life); the title song, played by the title character, during the opening credits (with a sunset background to die for); \"Matchmaker\" (amusing and well choreographed); \"If I Were a Rich Man\" (where Tevye gets uncharacteristically lively); \"To Life\" (brilliant dancing); and \"Sunrise, Sunset\" mixed with a vigorous and lively wedding scene.In the second half, the mood changes significantly with the story. The joy and humour (or at least as much joy as one can find while being poor), turns to sadness and melancholy. The song \"Anatevka\" enhances this dour mood as the preceding songs enhanced the happier times. The final sequence might seem prolonged but it brilliantly makes the heart cry with admiration for those who can still move ahead with resilience. The level of detail is very effective. Thankfully, the film ends with a medley of songs to alleviate the viewers' drained hearts.The performances are mixed but mostly good. Topol stands out in the main role. His eyes alone convey so much emotion. And his occasional conversations with God are delightful. He is convincing in his portrayal of someone who is almost resigned to his situation but can also release an outburst now and then.On social issues, \"Fiddler\" is rightly renowned for exposing part of the history of anti-Semitism. But it can also be credited for exposing the daily grinds of the working poor. And of course, the songs, the colours etc.....!!!!!!!!! - dbamateurcriticOUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Directing by Norman Jewison",

            "content": "To celebrate my 1600th review for this site I turn to another of my favourite films. Like a number of other cinematic genres, such as the war film and the Western, the traditional Hollywood musical was to go into something of a decline in the late seventies, but the early part of the decade had seen two very fine examples, \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and \"Cabaret\". \"Fiddler\" is set in the Russian village of Anatevka in 1905. Actually, Anatevka is really two villages, one Jewish and one Christian, and there is little interaction between the two. Nearly all the main characters are drawn from the Jewish community.It amazes me that anti-Semites have sometimes attempted to brand Jews \"rootless cosmopolitans\", as Jewish communities have always struck me as very conscious of their roots, their traditions and identity. The film, like the Broadway musical on which it is based, can be seen as an exploration of the role of tradition in Jewish life. In the opening song, actually entitled \"Tradition\", the main character Tevye explains the importance of tradition to him and his neighbours. Several Jewish traditions, including a wedding and a Sabbath meal, are reproduced in the film.The film, however, also shows how the traditions which Tevye holds so dear are being challenged from within and threatened from without. Within Anatevka and the wider Jewish community the younger generation are starting to question the values which their parents have lived by. The threat from outside comes from state-sponsored anti-Semitism in the form of the pogroms. The film's title comes from a line of Tevye's; he compares the predicament of Russian Jews to that of a fiddler on the roof, desperately trying to keep his footing and to play a merry tune while in a precarious situation. Tevye intends this as a metaphor, but an actual fiddler appears in the film at various points.The story is a simple one. Tevye, a poor village milkman, and his wife Golde have five daughters but no sons. The three elder girls are all of marriageable age (the younger two are just children), and all three find husbands who, in one way or another, represent a breach with tradition. Tzeitel, the eldest, would rather marry her childhood sweetheart Motel, a poor tailor, rather than the wealthy but elderly widower found for her by the village matchmaker. Hodel, the second daughter, falls in love with Perchik, a politically radical student, and stands by him even when he is exiled to Siberia for his part in a demonstration. And the third daughter, Chava, wants to marry a Gentile. (Motel and Perchik are both Jewish). Marrying outside the faith is a step too far for Tevye, even though his love for his family has led him to give his blessing to Tzeitel and (rather reluctantly) to Hodel. He refuses Chava his permission to marry, and disowns her when she defies him by marrying her beloved in a Christian ceremony.There are a number of reasons why I have long regarded this as one of the greatest, perhaps the greatest, of all screen musicals. The first is that the songs (music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick) are very fine ones. They range from the rousing (\"Tradition\", \"To Life!\") to the deeply moving (\"Sunrise, Sunset\", \"Far from the Home I Love\") to the humorous (\"Matchmaker, Matchmaker\"), although the humour is sometimes rather dark. The song \"If I Were a Rich Man\", for example, contains some humorous descriptions of Tevye's imagined life if he were to become rich, yet is also a complaint addressed to the heavens against his poverty.The second reason why I love this film is the performance of Topol in the central role. Tevye is the dominant figure in the film, not only its main character but also its narrator, addressing the audience directly. Topol, only 36 at the time, was considerably younger than the part he was playing; Tevye, the father of three adult daughters, is probably supposed to be at least ten years older. The makeup department do a good job in making him look older, but Topol nevertheless brings a younger man's energy and vitality to the part, making a Tevye powerful, larger- than-life figure. He also has a fine singing voice. There are too many good supporting performances to mention them all, but I must single out Norma Crane as Golde, Leonard Frey as the timid Motel and a pre-\"Starsky and Hutch\" Paul Michael Glaser (here billed simply as \"Michael\") as the idealistic Perchik.My final reason for loving the film is the direction of Norman Jewison. (According to one story, he was only given the job because he was wrongly thought to be Jewish because of his surname). The original Broadway production was dominated by bright colours, inspired by the art of Marc Chagall, but the look of the film is much more realistic; the only time it veers into fantasy is during Tevye's dream sequence. (Location shooting actually took place in Yugoslavia, about the only part of Eastern Europe where American film crews would have been welcome in 1971). I think that this was the right decision; what works well on stage is not always the right choice in a film. Jewison's sombre photography helps to anchor the film in a particular place and time but also adds to its timeless appeal. The villagers of Anatevka are people we can identify with, who speak to us through the years about the problems of their own time and of ours. (Nobody can watch the film without being uncomfortably aware that in years to come the Jewish population of Eastern Europe were to suffer tribulations far worse than anything the Tsarist regime could devise). Jewison, Bock, Harnick and all those involved with the film invest it with the universality which is the hallmark of all great art. 10/10",

            "content": "Solomon/Sholom Rabinowitz was probably the greatest Eastern European Jewish writer (his closest competitor is Issac Peretz). In the late 19th Century, writing as \"Sholem Aleichem\", he wrote a huge amount of short stories, novels, and plays. When he supposedly met Mark Twain at the start of the 20th Century, Twain said he was told he was the American \"Sholem Aleichem\". Most people who know of him recall his invention of the character of the philosophical and wry witted dairyman Tevye. Tevye, in his village of Anatevka, is struggling to make a living and raise his seven (not five) daughters with his wife Golde. The short stories not only deal with his philosophical point of view of how God and man (in particular the Jews) coexist, but also how to get the girls married without the financial muscle to give them dowries that are expected.Joseph Stein's play for the Broadway musical this film is based on reduces the number of the daughters to five. Actually only the stories of the first three daughters Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris), Hodel (Michele Marsh), and Chava (Neva Small), are given in greater details - because the other two remaining daughters have stories that don't quite fit in with the film's conclusion. Shprinze (Elaine Edwards) drowns herself when jilted. Bielke (Candy Bonstein) does marry a millionaire war profiteer (the stories went up to the Russo - Japanese War), and Tevye has a brief period of prosperity (though he loathes the son-in-law as a bullying ignoramus) before the son-in-law's fortune collapses. In the movie the two girls end up heading for America with their parents.But Stein's play manages to get the spirit of Aleichem's stories across, so that the changes I mentioned are not too important. Tevye (Topol) can't understand why he is made to struggle daily and never get's a chance for some prosperity. \"You have made so many poor people.\", Tevye says to God. \"I realize it is not a crime to be poor...but it's no great honor either!\" There is a chance for Tevye when the local butcher, Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann) reveals he wants to marry Tzeitel. Tevye agrees to the offer of Lazar through the marriage broker Yente (Molly Picon), much to the happiness of his wife Golde (Norma Crane). But Tevye learns that Tzeitel is in love with the village tailor Motel Kamzoil (Leonard Frey). How Tevye gets out of the marriage contract is straight from the original story - it shows how useful the supernatural can sometimes be.Subsequently Tevye faces the love affair of his second daughter Hodel with the young revolutionary Perchek (Paul Michael Glaser), who ends up getting sent to Siberia (whither Hodel follows him). And then comes the third daughter, Chava, who falls for Fyedka (Ray Lovelock), which ends in a peculiar tragedy for Tevye - Fyedka is Christian, and when they marry it is in a Russo Orthodox ceremony. Tevye's love for his faith and tradition - the backbone of Jewish existence that Tevye insists on - causes him to renounce his living third daughter as dead to the family.The collapsing days of the old Romanov Empire are illustrated, showing the use of official anti-Semitism as a manner of controlling the situation (it really didn't help much). As the viciousness of the old regime towards Jews ends the film with the forced removal of Tevye and his people from their lands. And the only thing to do is head for America or Poland or Israel - any place but Russia.The play/musical's numbers are well done, as are the violin solos played by Isaac Stern. Topol was a fine Tevye - although one misses seeing Zero Mostel's great performance there are some television sequences of Zero singing \"If I were a rich man\" that give us an idea of what he was like in the role. Topol emphasizes the even tempered, realist who is Tevye, who has a heart, sorely injured at times. He is abetted by his wife, a role well played by Crane. Molly Picon has a good time as that yente Yente, who is constantly trying to make a living making arranged marriages. Leonard Frey is fine as Motel, singing \"Wonder of Wonders\". Also note Louis Zorich as the local police constable, who has a \"decent\" relationship with Tevye, but who finds it collapse when ordered to force the Jews from the village (Topol puts him in his place quite well here). This film was a brilliant example of how to film a musical classic, and make a classic movie musical at the same time.",

            "content": "Across the 1960s all the movie genres that had developed in the previous two decades underwent massive changes \u2013 the old biblical epics disappeared completely, the Westerns and gangster movies became almost unrecognisable. Then there was a new generation of musicals \u2013 avant-garde, burlesque-influenced, many of them brilliant but in a category of their own. And yet, musicals of the older format clung on for a surprisingly long time, rubbing shoulders with their more modern cousins. Fiddler on the Roof, adapted in 1971 from a 1964 stage show, is one of the last great classic musicals.Of course, Fiddler on the Roof is not as old-fashioned as all that. Although the Broadway musical was long dominated by writers of a Jewish background, the idea of doing a show using Hebrew melodies was only really thinkable in a more flexible era. And the score by musician Jeremy Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick just happens to be one of the finest musical scores ever written, with a canny and emotional union of melody and rhythm with words and meanings. For example, in the song \"Tradition\" there is a verse \u2013 each with its own different melody \u2013 for fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, respectfully. Then the father and daughter verses play together, creating a lovely harmony while emphasising that this is a story of father-daughter relationships. \"Matchmaker\" features some incredibly clever lyrics, moving from dreamy thoughts of ideal men and working round to a consideration of the realities of arranged marriage, with such poetry that combined with the sweet, flighty tune creates a sublime and poignant beauty. There is not a single weak song in the score, and the whole thing is perfectly structured, moving from the mighty \"Tradition\" to the delicate \"Matchmaker\", to the bombastic \"If I Were a Rich Man\" to the haunting \"Sabbath Prayer\" and so on.The director of this screen version is Norman Jewison, always a filmmaker of musical sensibilities. There is a lot of rhythmic editing in Fiddler on the Roof, perhaps a rather facile technique, but Jewison mixes it up with a lot of on-the-beat movement, a kind of choreography of everyday actions, often taking care to make each shot \"agree\" rhythmically with the one preceding it. In the scene where we are introduced to Golde and the daughters, almost every time there is a new speaker we get a cut, an angle change and a camera move. By making those techniques occur simultaneously Jewison lessens out the impact of each, getting that hurried, busy feeling without making it look over-edited or artificial. He's also very good at making the action slide gracefully into a song, such as the pan into a close-up that opens the song \"Matchmaker\". He doesn't need a massive shift in technical style when a song begins, so the whole thing flows very smoothly and naturally.At the heart of the movie is of course that gigantic performance from Chaim Topol. He has a brilliant dancing style, a kind of mix of big-armed gesture and a really unrestrained segueing into the song. He could probably not do anything really athletic or precise, but his feeling for the music is clear. During the talking scenes, he's brilliant at bringing himself down to a level of serious contemplation, then suddenly bursting it with a comically angered outburst. Norma Crane manages to match him in presence, and yet with a more natural, sober turn. And Leonard Frey plays the stereotypical gangly youth, believably bringing out some forcefulness during his confrontation with Topol. Those familiar with English sitcoms can look out for before-they-were-famous appearances from Ruth \"Hi-de-hi campers\" Madoc hamming it up magnificently as the spectral Fruma Sarah, and Roger Lloyd \"Trigger\" Pack in a bit part as the sexton.The music and the people bring to life a story that is wonderfully touching and ultimately rather bleak, as many later musicals often could be. And this is where Fiddler on the Roof really seems to span the trends of the old and the new. The triumph of love has of course long been the preoccupation of the musical, but the triumph of love over tradition does chime in very well with the spirit of the age in which this picture and its stage predecessor were produced. But aside from this context, Fiddler on the Roof's warm humanity, larger-than-life characters and beautiful music make it one of the genre's greats, a movie that can be enjoyed today and by generations to come.",

            "content": "You can tell by the reviews just who is watching this film. Young people don't understand it. Although you don't have to be Jewish to appreciate it, at least being from Eastern European or Russian heritage surely helps. After the intermission the entire \"personality\" of the movie changes and becomes more melancholy and sad, for the most part.It is a lot like the \"Sound of Music\" in the fact that it totally fictionalizes what really happened under Tsar Nicholas II in 1905 when this movie takes place. Fifteen hundred people died that year in \"pogroms\" which are the ethnic cleansing of minorities. The Jews were literally forced out of their homes by the Tsar's edicts. \"Anatevka\" is a fictitious settlement in rural Russia. The Jews, as always, were forced to live apart from the Christian settlement of the town, which was obviously Russian Orthodox. Like \"Sound of Music\" nobody dies in the film. The Russians are mean but not murderous. If only real life was like that.As an adaptation of a musical, it is almost flawless. The songs are wonderful and carry the storyline, yet do not impede it. Topal, in the best film role of his life, surpasses even Zero Mostel, who did the stage version. Topol plays middle-aged \"Tevye\" yet in reality he is only 38 years old. His accent is occasionally \"wrong\" as he pronounces several words with a slight \"English\" accent, although he is Israeli. The soundtrack is wonderful and the scenery makes the story seem \"real\" instead of just a filmed stage production. It was filmed in Yugoslavia. It is the best film that Norman Jewison ever produced and directed. The only faults I can \"see\" are in the DVD video transfer (done in 2001 by DVCC) which perhaps has been redone since and better(?). The sound is a good transfer, but the video suffers from \"video noise\", minor scanning errors, and some film dirt and wear. (The \"master\" was degrading.) It is a \"one disk\" copy of what should have been at least 2 disks, and shows some compression, as the film is 3 hours.Like Gone With the Wind, The Ten Commandments, Sound of Music, Kings of Kings, and other great films, it belongs in your collection although it will only be watched occasionally. The last time I watched it, I mostly used \"scene selection\" and viewed the great musical numbers.The many dance sequences (the Russian Bar Dance, The Wedding, Chava's Ballet) equal those of 7 Brides for 7 Brothers in complexity and beauty. \"Tevye's Dream\" is hysterically funny. \"Stunning, joyful and jubilant\"-quote from the NY Daily News. To life!After many years of reading \"Fiddler\" reviews, I feel I must add a \"footnote\" about Tevye declaring his daughter \"dead\" after she marries outside of her faith. This is in no way unique to just Orthodox Jewish \"Tradition\" and is found in many other strict religions as well.",

            "content": "Norman Jewison's adaptation of Jerry Bock's musical masterfully tells the story of poor Jewish milkman Tevye (Chaim Topol) having to deal with the dying out of traditions, as well as anti-Semitism in tsarist Russia. The obvious metaphor is the title character representing the situation of the Jews in Eastern Europe in the early 20th century, but the movie also seems to be alluding to the generation gap. Much like how young people across the world had little in common with the parents generation by 1971, Tevye's daughters want to find husbands on their own, rather than have a matchmaker do it.I once saw a stage production of \"Fiddler on the Roof\", and the movie equals it very well. Overall, the movie shows two things. The first is that musicals like \"FotR\" and \"West Side Story\" are easily the best of their genre, tackling less-than-pleasant issues (WSS dealt with racial tension). But also, it affirms that Jewison had made the biggest possible jump from his debut (\"Forty Pounds of Trouble\", which I've never seen but heard was vomit-inducingly atrocious). \"Fiddler...\", along with \"The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming\", \"In the Heat of the Night\", \"Rollerball\", \"Other People's Money\" and \"The Hurricane\" show him to be one of the greatest directors of all time.All in all, not only do I recommend this movie to everyone, but I would say that 1971 was possibly the best ever year for cinema: \"Little Murders\", \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\", \"Bananas\", \"Carnal Knowledge\", \"Shaft\", \"Willard\", \"The French Connection\", \"The Last Picture Show\" and \"A Clockwork Orange\".",

            "content": "Seeking help from Springfield's synagogue to get a coronary bypass operation, Homer Simpson came to Rabbi Kruftosky and told him: \"Now I know I haven't been the best Jew, but I have rented \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and I will watch it \u0085\"' I'll complete this quote later but for now, I understand why \"Fiddler on the Roof\" is highly regarded in the Jewish community, for it provides the most enchanting and entertaining insights on Jewish traditions, 'Tradition' as the motto shouted by all the villagers of the small and peaceful town of Anatevka, in pre- revolutionary Russia, traditions like an immanent symbol of eternity. Sure, traditions and rituals are the tools that men use to construct a feeling of immortality, as a community, hence to overcome the fatality of death. But this is even truer for a community persecuted for centuries and that couldn't even afford an attachment to a land, so the only land Jews could never leave is the one that could never leave them. Hence the powerful symbolism of the title: letting the music speak for the soul of your community on a place that you might fall from. The title offers a poetic vision of a tragic historic reality, conveying the feeling that joy can anytime be followed by tragedy. So, if it can't be eternal, well at least traditions are.Still, the content of these traditions can appeal to every culture, especially oriental: patriarchy, life in community, hard work, social status, marriage, and of course, Family. And all these values are incarnated by a poor farmer and milkman with five daughters: Tevye, played by Topol with an electrifying mix of authority, charisma, magnetism, self-derision and some vulnerability betraying his penetrative eyes in the most dramatic moments. Topol is the friendly host of that epic journey, breaking the fourth wall to share his thoughts with us, and from the way he apostrophes God, who's like the film's second character, he powerfully embodies both the pride and the doom of being the 'chosen people'. Topol as Tevye is a larger-than-life character, carrying the film with such intensity that whenever he's absent, you feel like something is missing. In a way, he indirectly points out the small weaknesses of \"Fiddler on the Roof\".Despite their narrative significance, I didn't feel emotionally engaged by the growing romances through the story's recurring subplots, although I genuinely liked the first two husbands, Motel the tailor and Pershik, the revolutionary student (good old Starsky). But there was something too predictable in the way it was handled. You could tell the movie's point was about traditions being undermined by modernity. First, a marriage with a non-promised, then a non-religious man with Tevye giving his blessings and permissions despite a first negative reaction ... but the twist was on the third daughter marrying a gentile, too much asking for. This time, no blessing, no permission, no \"on the other hand\" reasoning, it was the kind of deathblow to tradition that would have made Grandma Tzeitel roll over in her grave. I wouldn't have minded the predictability, but when a movie, even a light-hearted musical, spans three epic hours, you got enough time to figure out everything, then the feeling introduced by the first act inevitably fades out, especially after the exhilarating \"Lechaim\" part. Besides, there wasn't much in these daughters that could really grab me, the part where they were singing was too Disney-like and the best love story in my eyes, was still between Tevye and his wife Golde (Norma Crane). But trusting Jewison's direction, I wondered why such a long film for a a plot that wouldn't present any twists, I guessed maybe it was a deliberate choice in order to 'distract' the viewer from the real dramatic aspect incarnated by the anti-Semitic threat, the persecutions and the pogroms from the Russian empire, 'distract' as a way to elevate ourselves from this inexplicable level of violence, and keep us in a good spirit, on the roof, listening to the sound of this violin, whose notes are getting more melodramatic.After the wedding sequence, the film takes a more serious course until the inevitable happens when people leave Anatevka for Palestine, Europe or America. Tevye invites the metaphoric fiddler on the roof to accompany him for the new exodus, as to reaffirm the obligatory attachment to tradition, with two fingers pointing at the sky. I felt the ending of the film was a downer but the more I thought of it, the more I realized it was a bittersweet ending. In a powerful moment after the infamous pogrom that ruined the wedding, Tevye raises his hands in disbelief; it's hard not to see how this scene foreshadows more tragic events that would face the unfortunate descendants of these people. And while remembering this scene, from Topol's eyes, I understand and I respect how the movie speaks for a whole community.And because I knew I was going to evoke some tragic events, I'll end this review on a more positive note by fulfilling my promise with Homer Simpson's quote: \"I have rented \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and I will watch it. Anyhoo, can I have $50,000?\" This desire for money I will forever associate with the iconic \"If I Was a Rich Man\", one of the greatest moments in musicals history. Topol has such a communicative energy that I wish I could have joined his yubby-dibby-dibby-dums, to a feverish and passionate dance. This whole 'Ya Da' part, and the extraordinary \"To Life\" song with the dancing scenes evoke a sense of male fraternity reminding me that I share the same roots of these people if we go till Abraham or the hell with it that we're all part of a same humanity, with traditions, as a clever way to forget about death and raise all our glasses \u0085\u0085 to Life !",

Popular musical entertainment via Broadway, with heartfelt characters and a universal theme--Old World tradition versus the new ideals--resulting in a production which is alternately robust and bittersweet. The confines of the material (as conceptualized on the stage, where this show ran for nearly eight years) occasionally burdens the narrative, though director Norman Jewison keeps a pretty lively pace. The editing is weak and does the filmmaker no favors, and the camera never seems to be in the right place, however most of the performers are intensely in-tune with this story and bring out the jubilant soul of the piece. Topol stars as simple milkman Tevye, watching as three of his five daughters drift away into the arms of romantic suitors; he consults with God on matters of money and the heart, weighing each circumstance with even reasoning, and compares the attempt at living a common yet balanced life to that of a fiddler on a rooftop. The film would hardly be much more than an old-fashioned, sentimental exercise were it not for Topol, who sings and dances and jiggles across the screen like a circus bear. In Topol, Jewison has found an appropriate way to capture this theatrical happening on film--and actually make it mean something. Several sequences feel lumpen, and too often there's no exaltation at the climax of the musical numbers, but it still works a fiery-eyed kind of magic. *** from ****",

In my opinion, FIDDLER should have won.As I got older, I realized why FIDDLER ON THE ROOF lost the coveted Best Picture Oscar. It was too orthodox for the taste of the Academy voters. In addition, many of the voters could not bring themselves to vote for a picture where Tevye would never accept a gentile son-in-law despite the fact that Orthodox Judaism forbids interfaith marriages. The Jewish academy voters, many of whom are not religious at all, didn't want to be reminded of these prohibitions.What a great ensemble cast! Too bad that Norma Crane (nee Anna Bella Zuckerman) and Leonard Frey died at the peak of their careers.Topol gave a terrific performance and was Oscar nominated only to lose to fellow Jew Gene Hackman (THE FRENCH CONNECTION). Molly Picon, as Yenta, deserved a best supporting actress nod but did not get it. To me, Leonard Frey was a surprise Oscar nominee in the supporting category; whereas in the Golden Globe awards, Paul Mann, (who portrayed butcher Laser Wolf), got a supporting nod.The musical numbers are staged with grace. The wedding scene, where the awesome Sunrise, Sunset is performed, is memorable and poignant. The Russian dancing sequence, and Tevye singing If I were a rich man are done with finesse.As is depicted throughout Jewish life, the Jews have become wanderers but will never give up their heritage and musical traditions. Fiddler on the Roof does not foresake anything in providing great entertainment, much history and music that is forever etched into our hearts.Films like FIDDLER ON THE ROOF are terribly missed. ****",

In this setting a peasant farmer wants to marry off his three daughters - but he only gets trouble, trouble, trouble...The film musical is a strange fish in that it can be an absolutely brilliant way to tell a story or the worst. However well you to put it- the sight of people suddenly bursting in to song to make a point or illustrate information is quite strange and there are many that can't quite get their heads around it. Certainly it shouts \"this is not real life\" more than any device in the history of cinema and you half expect the camera to pan around and watch the orchestra playing the music! The format works far more effectively when the central music is also central to the theme itself. Such as in A Star is Born or Cabaret. We expect music to sung on a stage - but in the middle of a street with people passing by as if this was the most normal thing in the world?The music in Fiddler is only average and strangely dated even for the time it was made. It wasn't a film musical that \"had to be made\". In If I Was a Rich Man we have an all-time classic and in Sun Rise/Sun Set a minor classic - but the rest is mediocre, although sometimes made brilliant by fantastic dance or visuals. We can't go back in time and understand Topol (the poor farmer) any more than we can understand MacBeth. We have had too much education. He sees himself as a man whose only goal is to continue to fight for his traditions and the idea of his daughter marrying a Gentile sends him in to apoplexy. We don't understand him today - indeed we are angry with his for his narrow mind - but this is the spool which his whole life is spun around.This film made me interested in history. To try and understand what is going on off screen. What the politics of the day were. My reading is that Jews were allowed certain plots of land because it was thought that they were hard workers who brought trade to an area - but they were not trusted and became something of a mixed blessing. The cruelty they suffered was often as a result of their own success - because success brings jealousy. I have only positive thoughts on this film. Yes, I wish the music was better and there was more of the fantastic dancing. I also wish that the politics of the day were better explained - although I don't know how.We know what lay in store for them (the Jews) later in life - but the lucky ones got to America a country that has always been their natural home. A place where hard work and success are admired and people don't come round to smash up your wedding - they simply don't let you join their golf club.",

When Jewison met with the producers for the first time, he informed them: \"You know I'm not Jewish . . . right?\"\"Fiddler on the Roof\" qualified as the first commercially successful English-language play about Jewish life in Eastern Europe. The story takes place is in Tsarist Russia in 1905 in the Ukrainian village of Anatevka. Tony Awarding-winning playwright Joseph Stein wrote the Broadway musical as well as the screenplay, and Stein drew his material from the story \"Tevye and his Daughters\" (or Tevye the Milkman) and other tales by Sholem Aleichem. Aleichem has the distinction of being the first to write children's literature in Yiddish. The story focuses on Tevye, a poor dairyman with five daughters, and his tireless efforts to preserve his family and religious traditions against a changing world. Tevye must deal with not only the strong-minded exploits of his three older daughters\u2014Tzeitel, Hodel, and Chava--each embraces a husband who represent a departure farther away from the customs of her faith\u2014but also with the Tsar's edict that evicts the Jews from their village.The poster for the Jewison movie comes from Russian artist Marc Chagall's painting entitled 'The Dead Man' and it depicts a wily violinist perched atop a roof during a funeral. Tevye (Topol) uses the 'fiddler on the roof' metaphor for his efforts to survive in a rapidly changing world. Tevye refers to the instability that ignoring traditions would create when he observes \"Our lives would be as shaky as a fiddler on the roof.\" United Artists hired Israeli actor Chaim Topol to play Tevye, partly because he had originated The film was eventually shot on location in rural Yugoslavia in what is now called Croatia.\"Fiddler\" relates its story through narration addressed to the audience. The protagonist Tevye (Topol) breaks the fourth wall and talks to the audience. He explains that the equanimity that the Jews of Anatevka have acquired from obedience to their ancient traditions is what keeps them going. We know that Tevye is a religious man because he speaks to God regularly. According to Tevye, the welfare of the Jews is as precarious as a 'fiddler on the roof.' In other words, it is no picnic playing a winsome tune while no breaking their backs with work. This figure steps in and out of the action over the course of the three hours to remind us about the eternal obstacles that confront the Jews. Despite the vast differences of time and setting, \"Fiddler on the Roof\" qualifies as a Jewish version of \"Gone with the Wind.\" Change assails the characters here as they do the families in the antebellum South in Margret Mitchell's masterpiece. Like the \"Gone with the Wind's\" Rhett Butler, Tevye discovers new inner strength in spite of the toll that these overwhelming changes exact on his life.Initially, Tevye arranges for his oldest daughter, Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris of \"The Cotton Club\"), through the village matchmaker Yente (Molly Picon of \"Come Blow Your Horn\") to wed wealthy butcher Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann), who is considerably older than Tzeitel. Instead, Tzeitel has fallen in love with her childhood friend, Motel (Leonard Frey of \"Finnegan's Wake\"), who is a lowly tailor. Motel pleads with Tevye not to marry his daughter off to an older man. Tevye hatches a crazy scheme to rescind his original plans for Tzeitel. He tells Golde (Norma Crane of \"Tea and Sympathy\") that he has had a nightmare. In the nightmare, Golde's dead grandmother advised him that Tzeitel ought to become Motel's wife as Heaven has decreed. Tevye reveals that Lazar Wolf's dead wife Fruma-Sarah has warned him that should Tzeitel marry Lazar, Fruma-Sarah will make sure that Tzeitel dies three weeks after marriage. This nightmare scene is about as surreal as \"Fiddler on the Roof\" gets with Tevye and Golde in their big bed in the middle of a graveyard while zombified relatives warble tunes. Predictably, Lazar Wolf is happy with this reversal of fate. Meanwhile, the specter of anti-Semitism rears its ugly head in the same scene that introduces us to Perchik (Paul Michael Glaser of TV's \"Starsky & Hutch\") as he meets Tevye near the town square. The Jews are discussing a recent edict that forced Jews to abandon their homes in a distant town. Essentially, Perchik is a young Marxist, anti-monarch student from the university with noble ideals. He argues that the rich prey on the poor. Tevye hires him to tutor his daughters and he pays Perchik off with food. Later, Model and Tzeitel are married. Tevye later learns that Hodel and Perchik have pledged themselves to each other. Shocked, Tevye gives them not only his blessing but also his permission. Tevye is quite so liberal when he disowns his third daughter, Chava (Neva Small of \"The Laser Man\"), for marrying a young Russian Gentile, Fyedka (Ray Lovelock of \"The Cassandra Crossing\") outside of her faith. \"Fiddler on the Roof\" illustrates the tenacity of the human spirit as the Jews, particularly Tevye contend with the ever-changing world. Several \"Fiddler\" songs have become classics, such as \"Matchmaker, Matchmaker,\" \"Miracle of Miracles,\" \"If I Were a Rich Man,\" \"Sunrise, Sunset,\" and \"Do You Love Me.\" Jewison summarized \"Fiddler on the Roof\" as \"the story of a man and his God, and his problems with his five daughters.\"",

Reb Tevye (Topol) is a poor milkman with five daughters. This movie is partly about the struggle between traditional life and the new ideas of marrying for love. All of this struggle takes place with the backdrop of racism and cruelty of Tzarist Russia.This movie does move slowly in the first half concentrating mostly on the daughters' relationships. They struggle against the traditional ideals. Around the midway, the wedding provide a change in tone as the struggle comes to a head, and the outside world tramples in on their world.The 3 hour running time could be tough for some people. They may have trouble with the first hour. There are some great songs in that section. It's a compelling story that's worth the watch.",

Tevye holds traditional values and has only his lame horse , his spouse and his companiable relationship with God , as well as a fantastic violinist (violin performed by Isaac Stern) . Meanwhile , at the idyllic location is growing anti-Semitic sentiment that threatens his village . The screen's most magnificent entertainment returns...filled with joy, laughter, love and life. ...A tradition.\"Fiddler on the Roof\" on the screen. Shout It From The Rooftops!Wonderful musical comedy/drama with spectacular musical numbers , emotion and Jewish social habits . It is a marvelous film with emotive scenes , enjoyable set pieces and great performances . Interesting and agreeable plot adapted from stories written by Sholom Aleichem and stageplay by Arnold Perl and special arrangement and script by Joseph Stein . Here stands out Topol who's terrific as an afflicted father who gets in problems with his married daughters and the political events happening in the pre-revolutionary Russia . Topol is an Israeli actor who played the role in London , while Zero Mostel was the Broadway star . Including Topol's inspired and unforgettable performance of the hit number : \u00a8If I were a Rich Man\u00a8. Being well accompanied by an attractive cast , such as : Norma Crane , Leonard Frey, Molly Picon , Rosalind Harris , Michele Marsh , Paul Michael Glaser , Ray Lovelock , Vernon Dobtcheff , among others . All of them create a sense of intimacy in spite of near epic proportions of this lavish and well made production .Special mention for the sensitive and enjoyable musical score from Jerry Bock and veteran John Williams . Likewise , colorful and evocative cinematography - though sombre at times- by great cameraman Oswald Morris with plenty of golds and browns which surprisingly won him an Academy Award . Finely detailed production design and stunning choreography . This bright film version was very well and professionally produced and directed by Norman Jewison . Norman's treatment of the musical piece is perhaps over-ambitious but really excellent. Jewison is a prestigious and veteran filmmaker . This famous and veteran filmmaker has directed successful flicks, and his greatest film is , of course, \u00a8Jesus Christ Superstar\u00a8 . He also directed other notorious movies , such as : \u00a8Agnes of God\u00a8 , \u00a8Moonstruck\u00a8 , \u00a8Thomas Crown\u00a8 , \u00a8Cinncinati Kid\u00a8 and this\u00a8Fiddler on the roof\u00a8 .

            "content": "Fiddler on the Roof is a solid musical and is actually a little better than I anticipated. Set in pre-revolutionary Russia, this film describes the life of Jewish peasantry and how their way of life faces off against more modern times. I found the movie to be quite a learning experience, as my knowledge of Russian history really begins at the Bolshevik takeover. This is the earliest film I remember seeing of legendary composer, John Williams. He does a magnificent job adapting the music from stage to screen. I loved some of the songs such as \"Tradition\" and \"If I was a rich man.\" For the most part, I loved the choreography. However, I was oddly bothered at some of the dancing, especially from Topol's character. It just didn't seem to strike a chord with me. I loved the production design and the cinematography. Despite its advancing age, the film still looks beautiful.Norman Jewison's film is a musical that takes place in pre-revolutionary Russia. A country that is struggling to modernize itself. Perhaps some of the reason is the Jewish peasants, who believe in their traditions. Tevye is a milkman who is poor and lives with his wife and five daughters. As the matchmaker suggests matches for his eldest daughters, Tevye has to deal with changing ways of life as his family attempts to break tradition.If you want to see a popular film that has a no-name cast, don't look further than this film. Until my initial viewing of this film, I have never heard of anyone in this cast. But I feel they all do reasonably well in their roles. Topol does a good job as Tevye. He looks to be an old man, but he was only in his 30's when this film was released. His singing was pretty good too. The pain he shows as he realizes tradition is crumbling all around him is pretty darn heart-breaking. The rest of the cast features unknown names such as Norma Crane as Golde, Tevye's wife and Leonard Frey as Motel, a lover of Tevye's eldest daughter.Overall, Fiddler on the Roof is an often entertaining musical filled with excellent songs and a score that puts the majestic John Williams on the map. The choreography is hit or miss and the film feels a little stretched. But the film does a good job in portraying peasant life during Czarist Russia and how difficult life can be for them, and how tradition unites their people. The beginning and end shots are beautiful, and what gives this movie the title it has. They are my favorite shots of the movie.My Grade: B+",

            "content": "I am not generally a fan of musicals that have been adapted to the screen, but \"Fiddler on the Roof\" remains as one of the notable exceptions, thanks largely to the genius of director Norman Jewison (\"In the Heat of the Night\", \"Moonstruck\", \"The Thomas Crown Affair, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\"), the endearing charm, vitality, and humanity of (Chaim) Topol, the ability of the rest of the cast to meet the elevated standard set by the lead, the innovative cinematography of Oswald Morris (\"Lolita\", \"Oliver!\", \"The Entertainer\", \"Guns of Navarone\") and the wonderful music, originally written by Jerry Bock and so capably adapted to the screen by John Williams.As to the excellent cast, although there isn't one, single Hollywood \"superstar\" present, this remarkable team nevertheless succeeds in creating one of the best musicals ever adapted to film and a movie that still survives on my list of favorites after many viewings. Personally, I would have loved to see Bea Arthur reprise her Broadway role as Yenta, but that's show business. Jewison's pick of Topol over Zero Mostel, however, was another one of his strokes of brilliance. Although Topol was mostly unknown outside of his native Israel, Jewison made a bold decision to cast him as Tevye, and this was only one example of the director's daring, innovative thinking that enhanced his directing and producing endeavors. He also agreed to cast Norma Crane as the female lead, Golde, who compliments Topol perfectly, even though I don't recall ever seeing her in a film other than her small but critical part as an unkind waitress in \"Tea and Sympathy\" fifteen years earlier. Only Jewison had the ability to see her as \"the perfect match\" for Tevye. Right? Of course right!The story, based on the Yiddish short stories of Sholom Aleichem, is a familiar one for the Jewish people as they steadfastly struggled to hold to their traditions and values in the face of a rapidly changing environment that becomes increasingly hostile to their existence as both a religious and ethnic minority. As bad as conditions were for them during pre-revolutionary Russia and Ukraine, their situation would only worsen, especially when the Germans conquered much of Ukraine, where the story is set, only a few decades later during World War II.The fiddler in the play is a symbol of the perpetually precarious existence of Jews who have often depended upon the kindness of strangers throughout much of their history. Beyond the unique Jewish experience and regardless of our specific faith or ethnicity, the fiddler represents the universal fragility of our lives on this earth. Indeed, the uncertainties of life itself are like...they're like a fiddler on the roof!",

Topol, I have seen in Flash Gordon and For Your Eyes Only, is a great star for this very good musical. The best song, from him, is \"If I Were a Rich Man\". It does not show The Fiddler on the Roof that much, but that's not important. The ending is a bit sad as well, but it is still a classic.

At first this appeared to be an enormously-entertaining story and solid religious one with the main character talking to God all the time.However, after 90 minutes of viewing this, I wondered if only God could sustain enough interest to keep going. Man, it was b-o-r-i-n-g!Since I like Israeli songs with all the violin music - and the title infers that, too - I hoped to at least hear a lot of that. Wrong again. Most of songs didn't feature that and they weren't anything to write home about. When they did have some dance tunes that were lively, they - like the movie - went on forever. To be fair some of the songs were good and a few of them became famous, thanks to this stage play-turned-movie, but not enough of them to suit me.Another thing that turned me off was the typical '60s-70s youth culture propaganda in which the message here was that the old traditions and the people who believed in them are shown to be of little value while the younger man with his new views is shown to be \"enlightened.\" This is such typical Liberal baloney.

Set apparently near the end of Czarist rule in Russia, it's the story of one Jewish family living in a small Russian village, and of their relationships with those around them. The story is basically told through the eyes of Tevye, the patriarch of the family, who was brilliantly portrayed by an actor named Topol.Opening with a wonderful song about tradition, that becomes the overwhelming theme of the movie - the role of tradition in the community - and perhaps, as the ending of the movie seems to make clear - the most uncompromising tradition is that nothing stays the same. We see this battle over tradition largely through the eyes of Tevye's three eldest daughters. The oldest of them was arranged without her knowledge to be married to the local butcher - a much older man - but was already in love with someone else. Faced with his daughter's refusal, Tevye gives in and allows her to marry the man she loves. The second daughter then falls in love with a revolutionary who has been staying with the family in exchange for teaching the daughters - a match her father disapproves of (partly because the groom is on his way to St. Petersburg to be part of the coming revolution) but then again gives in on. Then tradition is challenges once more, as the third daughter falls in love with a local Russian official - and a Christian. Tevye refuses to give in on this point, but the two marry anyway and are cut off from the rest of the family. Arranged marriages and the role of the \"matchmaker\" are thus dealt with, and the role of the faith in the lives of the Jewish people of the community is humorously reflected upon throughout. The localized idiosyncratic traditions of such a small community are also delightfully brought out. The story also doesn't shy away from anti-semitism, shown in scattered scenes throughout, and then the cause of the major disruption in the end as the community scatters widely (from Jerusalem to Chicago to New York, etc.) because of an anti-Jewish pogrom that drives them away. In the history of Judaism, though - a people often scattered; driven from one place to another - such an occurrence also seems to have the feel of tradition, and it results in a bit of a reconciliation between the family and their third daughter.It's an exceptionally well constructed story. While the song and dance routines are all excellent, I might suggest that some of them went on just a bit too long, but that's one of the few criticisms I would make of a generally excellent story.",

What a touching, beautiful portrayal of life in an exiled Jewish community in Russia (or was it the Ukraine?) around the turn of the 20th century. The star of the film is undoubtedly Topol as Tevye a subsistence milkman, the head of his family of wife and five daughters but there were certainly many others. His wife, Golde (Norma Crane - who died just two years after \"Fiddler\" of breast cancer) and his three oldest daughters Yente (Molly Picon), Hodel (Michele Marsh) and Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris) captured the modest yet determined characters of male-dominated Jewish women at a time when traditions (a word yelled by Tevye many times in exasperation throughout the movie) were irreversibly changing. As we learn during the story, Tevye and Golda first met each other on their wedding day and were told that, in time, they would learn to love each other. The scene where they actually admit this is absolutely beautiful.However, starting with Yente, Tevye and Golda's daughters rebel against century-old tradition and choose their own marriage partners - even though old ways don't die easily and, being the soft-hearted, loving father that he is, Tevye succumbs to their wishes until Tzeitel announces her love for a gentile and that is just too much for her father who (initially) disowns her.One amusing (to me) scene was where Hodel and her man, Perchic (played by Paul Michael Glaser of Starsky and Hutch fame) express their love for each other. As I watched the scene I was frequently reminded of Sheldon and Amy of TV's Big Bang Theory. (I guess you need to watch both to see it but it did make me smile!)I won't write about the ending to the movie as that would tend to be a spoiler too far. Just let me say Fiddler on the Roof is a very believable story of love, loyalty and sheer doggedness that is an inspiration to anyone who is experiencing difficult times.

            "content": "\"It's hard to be Jewish, it's hard to be Jewish, it's hard to be Jewish in Russia, yo!\" If this irreverent cutaway gag from TV's Community is indicative of Fiddler on the Roof's cultural presence in the 21st century (keeping in mind, this is the same generation that distilled Rent into \"Everybody has Aids!\" in 2004's cheerily crass Team America: World Police), it's a testament to how lovably unforgettable the story is to still incur such affectionate ribbing. But, endless revivals on and off Broadway aside, it's still primarily thanks to Norman Jewison's 1971 cinematic adaptation that the Fiddler flame continues to burn. The word 'timeless' is bandied about far too frivolously, but it's hard to find a more applicable candidate; more than 40 years after its release, the film is as infectiously watchable as ever. Furiously spirited and cunningly playful before revealing an underbelly of cavernous lamentation, Jewison's Fiddler on the Roof holds its place not only as one of the most unforgettable musicals of Classical Hollywood, but one of its most abiding, heartfelt delights. Like all the greatest musicals, Fiddler is timeless through its ability to translate an insightful glimpse into a specific sociocultural moment (the Russian-Jewish community uneasily navigating cultural persecution in pre-revolutionary Russia) into a swathe of universally relatable movie magic. From the opening number, where each reprise of \"Tradition!!\" brings more manic claustrophobia (thanks largely to Jewison's teasing editing, sonorously cutting between pieces of Jewish spiritual iconography to the beat), the film clearly establishes it will be doing everything in its power to poke at just that. Thankfully, the film's almost sitcom setup of each of beleaguered narrator Tevye's daughters (Rosalind Harris, Michele Marsh, & Neva Small; all slyly luminous scene-stealers) increasingly testing the boundaries of cultural transgression by marrying (gasp) for love always veers away from clich\u00e9d expectations enough to keep the film vibrantly unpredictable rather than the kind of saccharine staleness too many classical musicals dredge up. Instead, befitting the film's guiding metaphor, Jewison's directorial hand is steady as a rock. In spite of his film's voluminous run time and cascading emotional arc, balancing history, politics, and spirituality with humour, heart, and outrageously catchy musical numbers, Jewison's pacing is unflappably perfect. He finds an almost pristine level of cohesion, building each romantic crisis into the next in harmony with the brewing sociopolitical upheaval to circumvent any worries of episodic plotting. Similarly, his predilection towards the zaniness of his story not only infuses it with tremendous energy (just check out the expressionistic, ghostly insanity of Tevye's Dream to see Jewison's wackiness at full tilt), but makes the inevitable second half crash all the more agonizingly hopeless and despondent. Ahh, yes - that second half. Just as The Sound of Music is incomplete without its pesky Nazis, Fiddler's rumblings of \"trouble in the city\" come with eventual devastating consequence. Jewison wisely doesn't overplay the macro sociocultural turmoil, but merely sows seeds of revolt - a jab in the otherwise glib opening number (\"we don't bother them, and so far they don't bother us\"); a raucous engagement celebration turned heated cross-cultural dance battle, until escalating sharply with a bawdy matrimony turned hate crime arson. As silly as it gets, Jewison's Fiddler is just as unafraid to glare the horror of its historical atrocities straight in the face, until sputtering out with the crushing anticlimax of an enforced deportation, an ending too necessarily bleak to trivialize. Thankfully, Fiddler is too chock-full of unstoppably hummable tunes to ever become needlessly dour. The songs, naturally, are unforgettable enough to speak for themselves (though John Williams' rich, Oscar-winning background score does some considerable speaking of its own), so Jewison allows them to simply breathe, integrated into the narrative with such unceremonious muckiness that they feel all the more spontaneous and heartfelt when chirped by the mud-caked, visibly weary cast. In a more classical or more contemporary remake, the most iconic ballad, \"If I Were a Rich Man,\" would be accompanied by deluges of glitzy Broadway production values and dazzling choreography. Under Jewison's grainy, no-bullsh*t 1970s sensibilities, it has Topol shimmying alone in a grungy barn, imitating the braying of the livestock surrounding him. Chicago or Broadway Melody this ain't, but it's all the more enthusiastically authentic for it.Still, if there's a single roof tile that keeps this Fiddler upright, it's the legendary performance of Topol. He doesn't so much play Tevye as allow him to ooze out of every pore. Every grunt from his entirely credible Russian accent, every exhausted sag or mischievous prance, every sheepish grin or world-weary grimace, every indignant booming of \"TRADITION?!\" is so effortless they seem worlds away from the affectations of an actor: this is a wholly fleshed out, loving, hurting, human being on screen in front of us, and we can't help but love him with the entirety of our hearts. The play's 'Tevye talking to the audience/God' conceit may have been a risky prospect to translate into film, but in Topol's effervescent hands, we're too delighted to be invited into his monologue to split hairs. Supporting him, Norma Crane proves both hilariously cantankerous and deeply sweet as Tevye's prickly wife Golde, and watching the two of them share an incredulously clumsy romantic duet is one of the most adorable moments ever committed to celluloid. Finally, Leonard Frey is hugely affable and goofy as the mousy suitor of Tevye and Golde's oldest daughter, while Starsky and Hutch's Paul Michael Glaser raises laughs aplenty as an endearingly self-righteous revolutionary turned romantic. Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles - dispelling all fears of datedness, Fiddler on the Roof retains its worthy place as one of the essential, canonical movie musicals, sure to capture hearts and leave generations of audiences whistling \"If I Were a Rich Man,\" no matter how they're prompted to experience it. After all, it IS, evidently, hard to be Jewish in Russia... yo. -10/10",

            "content": "Norman Jewison had a directorial triumph with the 1971 film version of the Broadway musical FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, a beautifully mounted screen version of the classic Sheldon Harnick-Jerry Bock musical about the Jewish milkman and father of five daughters, who has his entire belief system challenged and thrown back in his face during this turbulent period in Jewish history. Tevye is a poor milkman struggling to keep food on the table for his wife and daughters but finds his whole way of thinking and the way he was brought up turned on him as his three eldest daughters have men come into their lives and his inner struggle as to whether honoring his own belief system is more important than the happiness of his daughters. His hardest challenge comes when his third daughter chooses to marry a man outside the Jewish faith. The Broadway musical made a star out of Zero Mostel, but I think Tevye turns in an electrifying performance as Tevye, that did earn him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. His rendition of \"If I Were a Rich Man\" is a classic. Other musical highlights include \"Tradition\", \"Tevye's Dream\", \"Do You Love Me?\" and the rousing \"To Life\", which features most of Jerome Robbins' original choreography. One of the best transitions of a musical from stage to screen and a joy from start to finish.",

            "content": "An old film of the double feature time with intermission music but no exit music is a great pleasure to reminisce about these old days. But has that film aged well or just grown old? The story is well known and the problems it contains and deals with are extremely serious. The anti-Semitism of the beginning of the 20th century in Russia, in fact next to Kiev, which makes it the Ukraine but under the Czar anyway. The various approaches are all the same in the end: traditions are the normal rule in this small community but the world is changing and many of these traditions are flying away like pollen in the wind: the matchmaker is waning out under the pressure of love, the exclusive community that does not allow any mixed activities, particularly love is breaking up on these very rocks named love, the fact that men dance with men and women dance with women falls down like a sand castle under the tide, etc. The first daughter marries within the Jewish community to a hard working young tailor she loves, against the first agreement negotiated by her father to get married with the rich but at least middle-aged butcher. The second daughter runs after a young communist who is arrested and deported to Siberia to get married there, with her father's blessing\u0085 and permission .This second daughter was already difficult but the young communist was a Jew. Quite different is the third daughter. She gets married outside the community, outside the faith, in the orthodox tradition because she falls in love with a young orthodox Russian. She will get her father's blessing in extreme conditions. The last two daughters are too young still to get married, and even to fall in love.The film is rather interesting in the way it shows poverty within dignity or dignity within poverty, the way it depicts all kinds of traditions like the matchmaker, Sabbath, a Jewish marriage, bottle dancers, a very tamed pogrom episode during the marriage celebration, with some surprising anachronisms like pumpkins and corn, I mean Indian corn. These were imported from America and it is surprising they had reached the Ukraine so early and as the dominant crops of a Jewish community in a small village. But after all why not? We can and may believe in miracles.But the best part of the film is the music, the songs, one long and haunting tune \"If I were a rich man\" that comes back over and over again. That's maybe a good song, though a little surprising and in some way a clich\u00e9 about the dream of all Jews to be rich one day. The constant asking God to do something for these Jews, for this one in particular speaking now hence always coming from the concerned person sounds slightly like begging for God's help and favor. This is too much centered on faith. The Jewish attitude is action first that has to be in obedience to God's commands and rules, and faith in God of course and in the knowledge that God is not at the service of the elected people who have to help themselves first, and we are back to action. When the community gets the order to leave within three days they accept their lot, pack and go. Apparently it did not go that easy in many cases. Maybe the final images of this exodus and the very final image of the poor milk farmer and his wife and the three daughters who are left, the tailor who is the husband of the eldest daughter and their baby, the milk farmer pulling the cart with their few belongings and behind them the Fiddler who has come down from the Roof, a mythical vision the milk farmer has in his mind's eye all the time, is no longer an exodus but rather a new Diaspora of a scattered community that has become isolated individuals or families. That makes this film mythical if not mystical and yet slightly old. We do not look at this period and at this situation with such clich\u00e9s in mind. Things were hard, very violent, bloody but also collective and with a deep inner sense of resistance in the name of survival, as if God could only go on existing if the Jews did not die all of them: the survival of the elect to perpetuate God. That inner resistance is not really captured and shown and the synagogue is vacated and the rabbi goes away with the sacred artifacts without any protest, without any help from the community and he disappears in the crowd in no time.Too bad because the film has great qualities.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",

            "content": "In Tsarist Russia, a Jewish milkman steeped in tradition faces a rebellion in both his daughters' marriage choices and world politics. \"Fiddler on the Roof\" is a great musical filmed as an endurance test. Going for a lower performance key, they replaced original star Zero Mostel with Topol (as Tevye). The latter won praise from voters giving out \"Academy Awards\" (a nomination), \"Golden Globes\" (an award) and even the \"New York Film Critics\" (eighth place). Nothing against all of this, but once Topol raises his hands on the dirt road and steps around in a circle, Mr. Mostel is missed. Lacking Mostel's movement and phrasing, the song \"If I Were a Rich Man\" is a noticeably lesser highlight. So much for tradition...Also didn't care for the grainy cinematography, village women's wigs, frightening dream wedding, and battle scene. And, film adaptations of theatrical plays should usually run shorter than their counterparts. Still, Topol and the cast do their best to fill the originals' shoes in the manner stipulated by Norman Jewison. Matchmaker Molly Picon's \"Yente\" is one-note, but what a note; why didn't she receive a \"Best Supporting Actress\" nomination? The suitors - tailor Leonard Frey (as Motel), student Paul Michael Glaser (as Perchik), and gentile Raymond Lovelock (as Fyedka) - are perfect. Much of the soundtrack, composed by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick, is thrilling - especially the magnificent \"Sunrise, Sunset\".******* Fiddler on the Roof (10/21/71) Norman Jewison ~ Topol, Leonard Frey, Molly Picon, Paul Michael Glaser",

Acting, music, and the story all are awesome and lead to this film being so good.Tevre is a great character. Really funny and inciteful and that is great to have as a lead character in a film. Also his wife Golda is the typical nagging wife type who is never at a lack for words. Other great characters are Motel the tailor, Lazer Wolf the butcher, and Perchek the teacher. Also all of Tevres daughters add a lot to the film in a different way. So overall a great cast of characters, one of the best in film history.The songs in this film are classic. You gotta love \"IF I were a rich man\", \"Matchmaker\", \"Sunrise Sunset\", and my personal favorite \"To Life\".THe story works because you can sympathize with the situation the characters are going through. After all it must have been tough on the Jews with all they went through from the Russians and later on the Germans. The way in this film that the Jews are seen being treated makes you feel sorry for them and it is well depicted on screen all of the bad things that they had happen to them.Also the conflict between characters is great. Like how zietel wants to marry Motel despite the fact that it goes against Tradition. And how Chava wants to marry a guy who is not Jewish. SO the conflict between characters is just as good as the conflict that all of the jews are facing in this film.Also there are a lot of funny parts as well. THis film is a pretty funny film at parts like when Tevre thinks Lazer wants to buy his cow but Lazer really wants to marry his daughter. And how Tevre must tell his wife how he gave his daughters permission to marry without consulting her.Great film. Classic. Masterpiece. Entertaining. Recommended.",

This is not just a \"Jewish\" movie, everyone can identify the story and love it. \"Topol\" as the poor milkman with five daughters, embodies the part to perfection. He has not only the singing chops but the demeanor and quick wit of the character. The other cast members are fantastic as well, ex specially \"Leonard Frye\" as Motel the tailor. Oh and what music! I dare anybody to watch this movie and not walk away from it humming at least a few of the tunes. My personal favorites are \"If i were a rich man\" and \"Sunrise and Sunset\". Movie musicals of recent years have been hit and miss. For example \"Chicago\" was great but \"Mama Mia\" was schlock, pure and simple. \"Fiddler\" is legendary! See it!",

Suffice it to say that Hollywood, which had churned out one disastrous musical after another for the last decade, finally got back to producing a musical it could be proud of. This beautiful story about a simple milkman in turn-of-the-century Russia who must come to terms with the loss of the safe and only world he has ever known, succeeds on screen largely due to the performance of Topol, who breathes body and soul into Tevye the milkman and creates one of those characters that for ever after you instantly associate with the actor who played him. You can feel him working overtime to keep Jewison's lumbering physical production on its feet, and his efforts prove themselves to be nearly Herculean, since Jewison can't direct a musical number to save his life. \"Fiddler on the Roof\" is not a dance musical, but it does have some rousing dance numbers courtesy of Jerome Robbins; however, you wouldn't know it from this movie, since Jewison almost unfailingly chooses the worst camera angle from which to shoot every single frame of the musical portions.What the movie does boast, however, is a glorious version of the musical's beautiful score, left nearly intact and memorably orchestrated by John Williams. It soars and leaps even when the production it's anchored to just sits like a lump.Grade: A-",

No Broadway actor can top Israeli-born Topol as the proud patriarch Tevye, who is the head of a large family of girls in old Russia. I am never certain it's pre-World War II Russia (Communist Russia) or turn-of-the-century Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution. Topol narrates the film with a voice of tradition and old-time Jewish values and traditions. While the musical is innately Jewish, its heart-felt humanity makes it universal in its theme of love, loss, man's inhumanity to man and family values. The musical has memorable and hummable songs that have become part of our American musical heritage - \"If I Were A Rich Man\" was just recently made into a pop song vocalized by Gwen Stefani. \"Matchmaker, Matchmaker\" is full of sweet girlish exuberance and has a big gay following to it (what musical doesn't have a gay following ?). The acting is actually good for a musical and this really is more of a dramatic film anyways. The \"fiddler\" is none other than world-renowned classical violinist Isaac Stern who produces beautiful, Aramaic sounds mixed with what appears to be Mendelssohn. The cinematography is gorgeous- the small Russian town is charming in both winter and spring. We feel for these people, we experience life through their eyes, we cry with them, laugh with them, love with them. The most moving part is toward the ending. The youngest daughter Chava (Neva Small in a great performance) decides to break tradition and marry a non-Jew, a Russian intellectual who was won her heart. This warrants her father's fury and he disowns her, a very difficult thing that happens even today among some hardcore zealous Jewish conservative folk or for that matter Muslims or Hindus. She represents the new generation. When the Jews of the town are forced out of their home by national edict, this is also very sad. This musical is neither sugary and sentimental the way Sound of Music or South Pacific is but is instead a musical with a lot of heart and soul. It is quite possibly the best musical ever made.",

The opening monologue by Tevye sets up the theme of the movie immediately--namely, that certain traditional values rule the population of Anatevka, and the people like it that way.  Then, throughout the course of the movie, these traditional values are slowly stripped away, as represented by the marriages of Tevye's three oldest daughters.  (As Tevye so aptly states, \"one little time you pull out a thread, and where has it led?\")  Tzeitel is pretty traditional, as is shown by the fact that she doesn't want her mother to dance with her father at her wedding.  But she wants to marry the man she loves, instead of going through with an arranged match.  Hodel goes a step further and marries a non-traditional Jew.  (Also, she only asks for her father's blessing, not even his permission.)  And Chava goes furthest when she is married by a priest to a Gentile.  It is interesting to note that unpleasant events follow all of the daughters' choices.  A pogrom interrupts Tzeitel's wedding.  Hodel's fiance is arrested and sent to Siberia.  And the Jews of Anatevka are evicted right on the heels of Chava's elopement.  So IMO, the message is clear: tradition must be modified to accomodate the changing times, as well as people's most basic needs and desires, as even Tevye recognizes.  But society should be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater, and respect traditional values to some degree (or as Tevye put it, \"If I bend that far, I will break\").  In all, the casting is perfect, the music is uplifting, and the message is very appropiate for our changing times.",

Several better Broadway musicals - Guys And Dolls, Can Can - have come off worse on celluloid but this one succeeds admirably, possibly because as the many productions/revivals have demonstrated, the leading role of Teyve is so well constructed that virtually any competent actor can take it on. Whilst several 'serious' themes - oppression, racism, tradition in a changing world - are tackled the 'entertainment' element is always present, sugaring the pill of propaganda. The score also provides a fine balance of songs that delineate character, move the story along and wouldn't work as 'stand-alone' songs, with the traditional (sorry about that) 'Broadway' element (If I Were A Rich Man, Matchmaker, Matchmaker, Sunrise, Sunset). On the whole a satisfying late addition to the Hollywood musical canon.",

To present it as something else does a disservice to the story. Showing the trials and tribulations of a Jewish man in Czarist Russia can inspire feelings of empathy; put it to music on the wide screen and it attracts attention but seems a little out of place. Technically the movie is excellent; most of the cast give credible performances, but the dramatic punch just misses the mark. Now, this movie contains the song \"Tradition\" which is song by Tevye and his family. If there is one thing this movie is not about, it's tradition. If anything, this movie is about change, relentless change, that totally sweeps tradition aside. By the end of the movie, Tevye's life is completely changed and all the landmarks of his life have been swept away, like what happened to Scarlet O'Hara in Gone With the Wind, except in the latter movie no one sings about it; there's nothing to celebrate. Tevye is lucky to be leaving, or rather fleeing, from Anatevka alive; it's a good thing he was friends with the local Cossack sheriff. Tevye's wife is so shrill that it's a wonder that he didn't leave sooner. As further evidence that tradition is dead, his daughters get married and leave, leaving him to ponder why. It's sad because for Tevye his world is changing and he cannot stop it. Welcome to Tevye's world.",

Virtually all aspects of the film are commendable, and while the story occurs in a different time and place, I found it hard to relate to such concepts as love being a radical idea, arranged marriages, and oh my! - a woman dancing with a man! With his rigid ideology and faith based lifestyle, Tevye (Topol) was the kind of person who would have been out of place in the Twentieth First Century, perhaps even in the fictional Russian village of Anatevka. The only character I could really relate to here was Paul Michael Glaser's Perchik, who wouldn't accept the world the way it was, and spent his time either teaching patiently, or railing against the status quo. Fortunately, many of the film's songs are quite well known in the popular culture, and provide entertaining interludes between the trials and tribulations of Tevye's household and the village's threat from the Czarist regime intent on relocating it. I don't want my tepid review here to dissuade anyone from watching the movie because it is quite well done with excellent cinematography and a talented cast of players. I even evaluate it as I would a picture I really liked, with my only reservations based on personal preference. Contrarian as I am, I'd say go ahead and see it.",

            "content": "I was a little late to the game when it came to Fiddler on the Roof. It seemed to be a movie every single person has seen, but now I have joined the party. Based off the very famous stage play, this film takes place in a pre-revolutionary village in Russia where there is a mixture of the Jewish and Christian people whom each have their own traditions. This film has a major theme in tradition, told from the view of the Jewish peasantry. The message regarding tradition is that times change and sometimes tradition has to be changed to keep up with the changing times. This film particularly talks about traditional marriage within a Jewish family, and how some events changed the very old traditions. Not only is the film about tradition or culture, but you can learn some history. This movie has a setting in pre-revolutionary Russia just before the Russian Revolution of 1918. The Jewish people are being exiled from their home over the course of the film to places like Israel or even Chicago. One of the iconic figures in the movie was the fiddle player-hence the title name. The fiddle player is shown in two very iconic shots-one at the opening and one at the end. This is a symbol for the tolerance or the forbearance of the Jewish people in the movie.This film, which is well-directed by Norman Jewison, is a musical that takes place in pre-revolutionary Russia (just barely). This is a country that struggles to modernize. Maybe a reason is because of the Jewish peasantry, whom hold dear to their traditions. One of the traditions is having a matchmaker pair up matches for people who are of age to marry. There is Trevye (Topol), who is a poor milkman who has five daughters of his own-three ready to marry. The matchmaker, of course, pairs his daughters up. But instead of arraigned marriages, the daughters find love. The eldest daughter falls in love with a poor furniture-maker and his second-eldest falls in love with a Marxist, causing anguish in Trevye as he sees tradition falling apart. Meanwhile, revolution is spreading across the country forcing all Jewish people to leave their homes and their country.This film, just like the stage play, is a musical. There are a lot of songs and dancing. I liked most of the songs, but two that stood out to me were \"Tradition\" which was the opening number as Trevye discusses the tradition of his people and \"If I Were A Rich Man\" which as Trevye lamenting his life and wondering how different it would be if he had money. From what I heard, the music is very faithful to the play. But there were a couple new songs added specifically for the film. It shouldn't be a surprise how good the music is because the legendary John Williams is at the helm as composer-one of his very first gigs in the film industry. As for the dancing, there is a good amount of choreography. I liked that Jewison made the dancing appropriate for the movie audience, not the play audience. Older musicals had problems where I felt I was watching a play, not a musical. Anyhow, there is a rather strange dislike about the dancing of Trevye. He moves his hands in such a weird fashion. I was like, \"Dude, don't make me tie your hands up when you are dancing!\" The film is reasonably well-acted. When I saw the cast, I haven't heard of a single name. Topol apparently is a well-respected Israeli actor and other than those distracting hand movements, he did a wonderful job. His singing was emotionally-charged as everything around him changes. He is a man of tradition, but even he can be persuaded. When asked by his daughters about marriage, he goes on a rant each time with God pleading why this has to happen to him. They are powerful scenes that rightfully nominated him for an Oscar. Leonard Frey as Motel, the lover of the eldest daughter does a solid job. I love his scene where he builds a sowing machine with giddy delight and holds it as if its his own baby. As for the daughters, I can't recall any names. They are just there to fall in love and play daughter to their father. They didn't have much characterization.Nominated for eight Oscars and winning three of them, Fiddler on the Roof is a very faithful adaptation of the Broadway musical. I didn't go nuts over the film, but it's perfectly enjoyable. It's nice to learn about the history and culture of a group of people (from Russia) I did not know too much about. I studied the Russian Revolution, but not so much what happens before. The music is mostly enjoyable and keep an eye out for the fiddle player. The film is very lengthy, but this is an adaptation that pleased fans of the play and general musical fans over the years.My Grade: B+",

When I revisited it now I am just all over in love with it for the first hour, the second hour seemed dragging and I had to sit through 3rd just to finish it. Over three hours long, this tale of a family of Tevye (playe by Topol) becomes too sardonic and too painful by the end. Had it been a tad shorter, it would have just right up there as a great movie. Now, still its definitely a good movie and worth watching for many reasons. Top most reason being there to see Topol playing Tevye, the family runner, a man for a family. Topol is just so fine and brings so much more to the character Tevye is that there is no escape form empathizing, falling in love with Tevye and embracing him for the way he dealt with his things. Setup in 1900's Russia, this is a tale of a family of Tevye who has 5 daughters and he has to get them married, now tradition is what he believes in sticks to and he has to fore go a few beliefs too for his own family and he does that too and becomes so very humane. Now, did I ever mention that its a musical and oh wow, the music is so good, 'Matchmaker' and 'Do you love me' are two songs that are my favorites and will listen them over again and again. John Williams for sure has produced a supreme soundtrack and worth a collection. So is the cinematography and art direction which are simply superb.Now, editing is not up to the mark and this being a musical I agree it has less scope and it needed a large landscape to take us and make us delve into the niceties of such place and also its grave atrocities. It's great if looked at as a play for its completely performance oriented but as a movie, I wish it was just shorter by say half an hour.It's 3/5 for a good movie and definitely worth a watch for TOPOL and surely thanks to Kishore da and Abhijeet for making me watch this.",

Tevye is a flawed protagonist. He tries, and ultimately fails in sending off his three daughters to the men that they love. All the while, he argues with an omnipresent God who never gives him the answers that he is looking for. This is a sad story about life.

            "content": "\"Fiddler on the Roof\" is one of those movies, similar to an opera, which presents itself in a playfully entertaining medium- while exposing deep seeded conflict of religious faith and historical political persecution. The protagonist is Tevye, is brilliantly portrayed by Topol.  Tevye embodies the \"old guard\" traditions of his Orthodox Judaism.  He always covers his head with a hat, and wears a prayer shall under his outfit.  Living in a closed traditional Jewish village, Tevye accepts his social \"caste\" as a farmer, by trade.  He sings, \"If I were a rich man...,\" but his conflict lies not with material or social standing, but with the traditions of ancient Russian-Jewish living.  You see, tradition is the thesis of conflict in this story.  Tevye notes that they have traditions that tell them, \"how to eat, how to sleep, how to work...\"  His closely held values are attacked throughout the whole story.  First, his daughter Yente fights the matchmaking system of the father choosing a husband for his daughter.  For she loves a poor tailor, but Tevye and the matchmaker have an older wealthy butcher eyed up for her.  Love is the key.  Marriage out of love was not a luxury in their society, as we have today.  However, Yente challenges the institutions of Tevye's world .  He eventually gives in to her, but not after cursing out loud, \"What ever happened to tradition!\"  As the story moves on, Tevye faces a hardship unlike any other.  His third daughter wishes to marry an outsider- a Russian farmer.  They love each other.  Tevye is at a crossroads.  He won't give in any further, as he has eroded the traditions enough.  In a sad moment, Tevye disenfranchises himself from his daughter for her behavior.  All the while this is going on, the harsh reality of the Bolshevik Revolution comes into play.  The village Constable, a Russian, turns on his old Jewish friends- terrorizing Yente's wedding party.  The evident persecution of Jews in East Russia is captured in this story, as Tevye's family must eventually leave their village by an edict from Lenin.  A short time after, in real life, Lenin and Stalin murdered and persecuted more Jews than Hitler, a point the story implies.My conclusions to the themes of this movie are as follows.  The author of this story smoothly advocates a change from strict Orthodoxy to Western modernism.  Marriage out of love, as opposed to arrangement, is more desirable.  However, he also implies that some traditions are too grandiose to part with.  One being inter-cultural marriage.  For as they were a small village of Orthodox Jews, the culture and religious faith must be maintained.  This is only possible with intermarriage among the Jews.  Tevye strongly opposed his daughters love for a Russian farmer, as he was not one of them.  Whether for good or bad, the author of this story valued highly the sacred culture of Judaism; having it intermingled or watered down by outsiders is to be opposed.  Finally, the historical reality of persecution of Jews comes alive in this film.  When I saw the film as a youth, I asked my father, \"Why are they being mean to those people?  They didn't do anything wrong to the Russians.\"  Having been educated on Nazi Germany and Stalin Russia, I now understand the answer to that question.  Whether you are a Jew or non-Jew, the \"Fiddler on the Roof\" paints a portrait of one historic time when Jews were persecuted against greatly- and you must acknowledge that as a viewer.  A truly great classic.  To parents:  this movie should only be seen by children who are mature and understand the concepts of political and religious history, as this is NOT another Disney musical.  The intense religious, moral, and historic concepts of this movie are not to be wasted on the blanket image that \"Fiddler on the Roof\" is a happy and simple musical movie.",

            "content": "Mel Brooks probably made the best comment on \"Fiddler On The Roof\" by casting the original study (of the stage musical) Zero Mostel as the lead of his seminal parody, \"The Producers\". Here, Mostel, in the role of bankrupt producer Max Biyalistok, tries to pull one over The Fiddler and turns the Nazi r\u00e9gime into a musical, \"Springtime For Hitler\". Apparently, even Brooks had his limits and so he didn't take the ultimately logical step of musicalizing Auschwitz.Brooks must have felt what I felt when I saw the depiction of orthodox Jewish life, poverty, forced marriages, progroms and eviction through the means of a musical: my jaw hit the floor at so much brazen presumptuousness.The shame about The Fiddler On The Roof is that it has a likable if conventional story at its heart. A simple but spirited father has to come to terms with the changing times, that his daughters will pick their own husbands rather than having a marriage arranged for them (which mostly meant being married off to rich, old men). I suspect it's that part of the story (along with lead actor Chaim Topol's congenial charisma) that many people like best about \"The Fiddler\". Fathers, mothers and daughters can all identify with this situation. Sons'll just have to sit it out, I guess.But that aside, wow, what a stinker. I've heard that some Jews consider this to be \"their\" musical / movie. For example I have read about one father who showed \"The Fiddler\" umpteen times to his daughters to explain Judaism to them. After having seen this movie, I think that guy is out of this world. This movie is just so damn trivial. Poverty is fun, orthodox Judaism means lots of singing and dancing in funny clothes, and that progrom, as far as progroms go, was certainly a bit on the farcical side, especially when those three hoodlums inhumanely tore that table cloth apart. Oh, the humanity.I couldn't work out what the eponymous fiddler character was about, so I googled that it was an image from Marc Chagal which had originally been incorporated into the stage design. As a graphic motif it probably made sense, but this effect is lost when we actually see the guy jamming away on his roof, and lead character Reb Tevye extols: \"A fiddler on the roof -- sounds crazy, no?\". Hell yes, Tevye. Crazy. Clich\u00e9. Forced. Gag me with a tongue depressor. He makes about as much sense as a euphonist in the cellar. Don't tell me you named the entire film after this sorry freak?This musical bored and upset me for almost three solid hours. And I didn't even dig the songs. Even in this aspect The Producers is superior (\"Love power ... the power of lurrrrrve!\".",

            "content": "There is something uniquely special (and even authentically magical) about this particular Musical, \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and especially the Film directed by Norman Jewison, starring Chaim Topol = playing Tevye, the milkman, and head of Family, keeper of 'Tradition' remembering + appreciating (thru emotionally resonant Song & dance) the massive Joy and unbearable hardship, resourcefully 'surviving' by maximizing tightly enduring family bonds (and resilient 'faith') within the confines of a typical Jewish community 'shtetl' common to eastern-Europe of the 19th Century (and prior).This film paints a heartbreakingly poignant picture of an impoverished, materially poor, but culturally & spiritually very Rich community (in the Russian/Eastern European Shtetls of the Late 19th/very early 20th Century). A typical 'pale-of-settlement' town also Rich in familial bonds, cemented and secured thru Centuries of spiritual belief honoring respected cultural 'Traditions'!This movie does an amazing job of authentically capturing this 'long-Lost' way of Life (in this particular case Jewish) but the transcendent artistic power of \"Fiddler\" is that it seems to represent a 'Universal' story of all our immigrant origins = a Way of Life, I think, very common to most humans, prior to our modern 20th/21st Century technological age. When family & faith was literally all there was to hang onto, daily existence being acutely fragile and uncertain. Mere survival reflecting that proverbial flickering 'candle in the wind' somehow persevering thru intermittent heavy showers & snowstorms.... still finding abundant Joy and significant meaning thru beleaguered everyday struggles.Anyway, not many Films have been able to capture both the fragility/ apprehension/ intense struggle to just survive => contrasted against the countervailing feelings of ecstatic Joy and strong-sense of Belonging & connection to Community.The saddest part, of the broader/ Later Story (for Jewish families, like these), was the terrible Fate awaiting the 'traditionalists' living in All those East European Shtetls (i.e. physical destruction & Death by hands of German Third Reich => or subsequent Soviet 're-education' => with departure/emigration for those fortunate few remaining). In any case, as \"Fiddler\" espouses a once very Rich & thriving 'World' that no longer fully exists in Reality but does Live on through the magic of Film & Song!

What was the daily riggers of life for my Grandfather and his Father's before him? How did they survive? Their livelihoods, customs, down time?? How they lived or survived the rugged lifestyle with out the modern conveniences? Not to mention the racial tensions created by the local regimes of that time, mainly \"antisemitism\"? My Grandmother remembers the harsh winters in Lodz. My other Grandmother would describe the horrible senseless acts of a fearful group of individuals called the Pogroms. These tormentors would ride into the Jewish section on horseback with saber in hand and would slice the heads off the locals including woman and children. Just a small sample of the horrific acts by the government based group to annihilate the Jews of Europe. Despite the harshness of the living conditions, writer Sholom Aleichem presents the story of Tevya the Milkman and his family somewhere in the Ukraine at the turn of the twentieth century. Personally I saw this play performed for the first time at sleep away camp. Then I saw a professional production starring Hershel Bernardi as Tevya. My ex-Brother-In-Law played Tevya in his college production and the story is always captivating with song and dialogue. The film doesn't disappoint either as Topol plays a struggling milkman who tells his audience in a philosophical way his ideas on life as he looks toward the sky to ask G-d why things are? Tradition is most important to Tevya with out an explanation as to why? But because it's a tradition. Tevya has a wife of 25 years Golde (Norma Crane) does a capable job as the matriarch who cooks, cleans and has the Sabbath meal prepared unconditionally. They have five daughters but this story focuses on the three oldest and their love interests. First there's Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris).This was at a time when it was customary in Jewish law to have an arranged marriage done my a Matchmaker (Molly Picon)Yente. Grey,middle aged Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann)is looking for a second wife and Tzeitel fills the requirements under strong suggestion to the austere Tevya. Meanwhile Tzeitel is secretly meeting love interest Motel the tailor(Leonard Frey) and they want to be married but timid Motel has to tell Tevya that despite his hopes of a rich in-law, Motel and Tzeitel have a mutual love for each other and pay no heed to traditions. One of my personal favorite songs is Wonder of Wonders performed by Leonard Frey as his marriage will be a reality with a concocted dream by Tevya to pacify Wolf and Golde. The dream sketch was cleverly done in black and white. The second daughter Hodel (Michele Marsh) falls for a wondering radical Perchick (Paul Michael Glazer) who wants to go to Moscow and start a Marxist revolution against the Czar. Our third front or daughter is the Ginger haired Chava (Neva Small), who is an avid reader and meets a gentile boy who she eventually falls in love and marries against the wished of her parents as Tevya professed that his daughter is dead to him. Powerful scene in any production of the play. The songs are so familiar and the story on paper, serious in nature is still pleasant to watch. Our character do sprinkle a bit of humor despite the tense political climate brewing in Czarist Russia. Note Norma Crane who played Golde was in bad health during the film yet her performance was a adequate.The kind of play you can get lost in as you see your Jewish ancestry played out literally. Other cultures would ask what Judaism entails? I say watch this play and you'll get quite an education about Diaspora. How millions of Jews Emigrated to the United States because of racial problems and changing governments which prohibited certain religions. You'll enjoy the story and learn a few things about the Chosen People.",

The Fiddler on the roof as described by Tevye in the opening of the movie is symbolic for existentialism. It is a metaphor for the challenge of balancing your life and knowing your place in the world. Traditional religious rituals and customs give the community where Tevye's family lives the supposed comfort to get through the balancing act. However, Tevye's three oldest daughters challenge tradition in their romantic lives and the \"outside\" world is entering into a time a extreme turmoil. The ways of the older generation clash with those of the younger generation. And through it all Tevye is really pretty progressive for a man in his society.The story is serious and humorous. The film is shot beautifully. The songs are great, some more catchy than others. Tevye's constant dialog with his \"best friend,\" God is thought provoking and often funny.Since it is based on the book Tevye's Daughters, it is appropriate that his daughter's romantic awakenings be the main concern of the plot. The oldest daughter challenges tradition a little by pledging her love to a man of her choice, but he is a (soft-spoken) tailor from the same village and they still have a customary wedding. The middle daughter bends tradition by falling for a progressive teacher and budding revolutionary. I love that in the existential crisis he claims humankind must take much more responsibility for balancing on the roof and that traditions are not going to keep us safe up there. The youngest of the three daughters of marrying age meets another intelligent reader, but he is a Russian Kazakh and Christian. This is breaking the tradition entirely by having a marriage of two faiths. It is because the relationships of the three daughters and the father-daughter relationships are so well rendered that this story is more than a Jewish story.",

The cast is generally good, it's realistically filmed on location (or close enough) in Yugoslavia, etc. However, there is something really lackluster in the whole production.The big disappointment is Israeli actor Topol as Tevye. He's younger and handsomer than Mostel, but doesn't sing or \"emote\" nearly as well, and he has one of those rather odd Israeli accents that are partly British -- certainly NOT Russian -- and that comes off as awkward. Tevye is the prime role, he has the major songs, like \"Tradition\" and \"If I Were A Rich Man\", so having a so-so leading man here is fatal to the film. He's also too old to play Tevye on screen -- on the stage, it's OK to have an older actor, but Tevye's oldest daughter is 18 and he was supposedly married at 18 himself, so realistically he is supposed to be about 37. Instead, Topol appears 50 or more with gray hair. (This is also true for the actress who plays his wife.)The larger flaw of the film is that like a lot of other musicals (the recent \"Rent\" comes to mind), the film director felt that it had to made on location and as realistically as possible. This just doesn't work well for most musicals, which are intended for the more stylized presentation of a stage and a theater. Forced to look at Tevye's actual barn and animals is very distracting. Plus, with the action staged out of doors, the singing (which is obviously done in a studio) sounds absurd -- where's the echo chamber? LOL!Despite everything looking \"real\" in the physical sense, the art direction has gone way overboard in the sense that all the peasants are depicted as living far too grandly for Jews of that time and place. Tevye's house is a multi-story Ralph Lauren summer home, and sits on many acres of land -- in those days, he would have REALLY been a rich man if he had all that. When Tevye sings about being rich and owning chicken, I believe its meant to imply that he's too poor to actually own any -- not an excuse to cut to photography of his flock!That being said, if you like the music and general story, it's all here, and reasonably faithful to the theatrical production in terms of plot, resolution, etc. Since there is no bringing back Zero Mostel, this is what we have! and probably a bit better than the typical community theater productions that still are around.In conclusion, I see a lot of reviewers talk about the sadness of the ending, as the Jews are forced to leave Anatevka. Personally, I have never considered this as sad. The film distorts things a bit by depicting Tevye as a landowner with lots of farm animals, furniture, a house, etc. In reality, peasants this poor had virtually nothing. The reality -- as experienced by my own paternal grandmother, who left Russia in 1920 -- is that these Russian Jews came to America to lead vastly better lives in a free country. Not to mention that their children and grandchildren became successful doctors, lawyers, business owners. This is not a sad ending, folks -- it's the happiest ending of all time!",

More, the movie emphasizes the importance of tradition in the expression of people's devotion towards God.One thing we can learn is that love doesn't take rules into account.

            "content": "The Oscars are run in a most peculiar way. Occasionally, the right film (\"Ben-Hur,\" \"Amadeus,\" \"Return of the King,\" and more) is given the top prize. More often than not, total incompetence is rewarded (\"Around the World in 80 Days,\" \"Titanic,\" and \"Crash\"). And then you have those times when a great movie is snubbed because of a film that's not horrible, but still not in the same league. Classic examples: \"Slumdog Millionaire\" swiping \"Milk,\" and \"The French Connection\" coming out on top of Norman Jewison's incredible \"Fiddler on the Roof.\" Well, \"Fiddler\" will always be the 1971 Best Picture in my mind. By far the best-acted movie musical of all time, it is also one of the most genuinely affecting and universally accessible. The story follows Tevye (played superbly by Topol), a wealth-challenged Russian Jewish milkman with a lot of faith, as he tries to survive a world in which so many people hate him for that faith. He also faces the courtship of his three oldest daughters-- the lovestruck Tzeitel, the feisty Hodel, and the shy Chava.Also incredible to think of is the fact that movie musicals were effectively dead when this was released. Gone were the glory days of \"Oklahoma,\" \"West Side Story,\" and so many others, replaced by audience indifference to perfectly capable offerings like \"Camelot\" and \"Doctor Dolittle.\" This film could have been one of the most horrendous flops (until it would have been dethroned by the magnificently underrated \"Howard the Duck\"), but it became something much bigger and better: a completely deserving success.The art direction, cinematography, costume design, acting, and screen writing are all plenty admirable here. But what really deserves most of the credit (besides Jewison's direction) is the score adaptation by none other than John Williams, the man whose iconic themes for \"Star Wars,\" \"Superman,\" and \"Indiana Jones\" will never leave people's heads.Still, the movie does have its faults. The film's ending is a slightly confusing mixture of \"downer\" and \"there's hope for a better tomorrow,\" kind of like \"Battle for the Planet of the Apes.\" And in the titular Fiddler's few in-focus moments, he's not really given a good performance by Tutte Lemkow. But all things considered, \"Fiddler\" is rich, bewitching entertainment.",

It has been said that if you are Jewish you will enjoy this film more. Even though I am Jewish I think it is great story and it doesn't matter if you aren't Jewish to love it. Truth be told i can count the musicals that I like on one hand. It is the genre I like te least. I just rarely get into people bursting into song in a film. But I love this film because it's story and performances are so strong.The story is well known. Topol stars as Tevye, a poor milkman in a Russian village called Anatevka. The story revolves around Tevye doing his job, worrying about marrying his daughters and most of all his daily conversations with G-d. Topol is so good as Tevye that you can't help.but love and feel for the character. His interaction with his family, especially his wife Golde are funny, endearing and times sad. Even though he is the film's main character the supporting characters are very strong. The cast is just as good as Topol. The film is long but never boring. It has a great mixture of music, comedy and drama. It deals with the persecution of Jews in the Russuan pogroms. But it focuses most on Tevye dealing with his faith and love for his daughters. He has a hard time accepting change to what he knows and tge traditions he holds dear. There are some heartbreaking scenes in this film, but it is ultimately hopeful.Even though the film centers around a Jewish village it could have been about any other group. It is relatable to any group. It is about not forgetting your past while accepting change.The film is funny, endearing, sad, and hopeful.I love it!!!Grade: A",

            "review_title": "A perfect adaptation of an enduring musical",
            "content": "There are few stage musicals that as enduring as that biggest claim to fame of Joseph Stein, Jerry Bock, and Sheldon Harnick. There are few stage musicals whose songs, dialogue, characters, scene writing, story, themes, choreography, and splendidly witty, wry humor have so steadily stood the test of time, becoming so recognizable in the public consciousness and easily adaptable. At turns woefully grim, or solemn, or wonderfully funny, or joyous, 'Fiddler on the roof' is a classic piece of theater that very few of its brethren can truly match. It is such an absolute pleasure, as one who enjoys both theater and cinema, that this 1971 film adaptation should be so faithful not just to the objective content of the title, but to the feelings it elicits and imparts. Between Stein's screenplay and its realization by esteemed filmmaker Norman Jewison, and the impeccable contributions of cast and crew alike, this movie is roundly excellent in every regard, and surely a must-see.It can't be overstated how fabulously well made this is. As if the adaptation weren't enough, Jewison's attachment alone should pique the interest of any moviegoer, for his sharp mind and keen eye have brought us many a superb feature, and this is just another gem in his crown. Oswald Morris' cinematographer is equally smooth and vivid, mindfully capturing every detail to greet us. And what detail! Production design, art direction, costume design, hair and makeup, to say nothing of the timeless choreography: every element of the visual production is flawless. The sound design, too, is unimpeachable, letting every note of Bock's music (adapted here by - John Williams!), and every word of the lyrics sung by the tremendously skilled cast, ring out with faultless clarity. The casting is just exquisite, from chief star Topol down through every family member, suitor, villager, and smaller supporting role. Each illustrates stupendous skill of both song and dance to match the resplendent spirit of the musical, and just as importantly, all demonstrate swell acting skill, outstanding range, nuance, and personality, becoming as essential a component of this rich tableau as every beam, pillar, slat, chicken, and coat or hat.For whatever changes there may be to 'Fiddler' in adaptation, they are slight and few, and certainly do not alter the substance of the stage production. With Stein, one of the original creators, penning that screenplay himself, it is assured without question that the tale remains intact down to the tiniest facet. Teyve's ruminations - speaking to god, to his animals, or to the audience, sometimes freezing the action in a scene otherwise - are a critical aspect of the presentation, spotlighting his many conflicting thoughts and feelings, and these have not been modified even a bit. The bountiful heart, the incredibly clever humor, and the lighter yet still ponderous and even heartbreaking drama of Teyve grappling with the changes in his world, are all a pleasure to enjoy anew in the cinematic medium, an absorbing and deeply impactful experience. Even the most jolting, horribly sobering beats - the egregious, genocidal oppression and violence of the state - are rendered ever so smartly, ensuring their gravity is felt no less. Moreover, for as vibrant as the musical may be when seen live on the stage, one might well argue that there's a level of detail that just doesn't reach every person sitting in a theater - the full subtlety of every expression, of every gesture and movement - but there is no loss of fidelity at all on film.Factor in attentive editing to draw all the disparate pieces together, and what more is there to say? There are few stage musicals that are as enduring as 'Fiddler on the roof,' and few movie adaptations of musicals that are as perfect as this. Delightful and difficult in turn, it's always brilliant and strongly affecting, with every exquisite part building into an indelibly great whole. Thanks to the writing, the direction, and all the hard work of the cast and crew, it never really feels as long as three hours, and that's no minor accomplishment, either. When all is said and done this really is a must-see, for theater buffs and cinephiles alike, and general audiences, too. However one must go about carving out time to watch, this is one title that demands viewership at one point or another.",

            "content": "\"Fiddler on the Roof\" (1971), I remember watching this movie back in school and enjoying it. I am part Jewish, my dad is Jewish and my mom is Christian. Being half Jewish and half Christian, when I first heard of this film, it sparked my interest. Sure enough, it did not disappoint! Then, when I watched it just recently, I enjoyed it just as much, if not more. \"Fiddler on the Roof\" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline is based on the original Broadway play of the same name that came out in 1964. Usually, taking a play and transferring it to the big screen is hard to get right. However, this movie does the original play justice and then some! One thing to point out, the plot line synopsis makes this film sound a bit dull. But, the simplicity of this story is what helps it to shine. Normally, a movie with a simple storyline can be quite boring, but in the rare case of this film, it makes it all the more gripping from beginning to end. I like simplicity done right when it enhances the story, and this is no exception. The only nitpick of the storyline is the musical numbers. Most of them work, my personal favorite songs in this movie are: \"Tradition\" and \"If I Were a Rich Man\". The rest of the songs are good, but sometimes they come out of nowhere, especially if you're watching the movie for the first time. Some of the songs drag the plot to a halt and most of them occur randomly. Like, out of nowhere, a character will just suddenly start singing. These songs don't hurt the movie, but some of them the movie could've done without. As I said, it's a big nitpick and it doesn't ruin the storyline or the rest of the film at all. I still give the story a pass. One other thing to point out, the movie is three hours long. However, it goes by in the blink of an eye, which is impressive. For a film of that length to hold my interest all the way through and go by so fast, that's definitely a big accomplishment. Those two aspects are hard to nail, let alone both. All of the acting is fantastic from all of the actors and actresses and they really bring their respectable characters to life. There is one actor who really stands out, Chaim Topol, otherwise known professionally as just Topol. He plays the main character of the movie, Tevye. Here's a cool piece of history, Topol actually played the character in the original play. Isn't that cool? That's one of the biggest reasons why his performance is so good. He took his fully acquired knowledge of the story and transplanted it all into this role for the big screen. What results is a truly timeless performance! Plus, his great acting shows in the rest of the cast as well. All of the sets/locations are beautiful and gives the film a stunning atmosphere. Set in the fictional village of Anatevka, the sets/locations make you feel like you're in that time period and part of their town. All of the special effects are well-done and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack is perfect. Being adapted and composed by John Williams, that comes as no surprise. John Williams is my favorite music composer in all of cinema, and he never lets me down! \"Fiddler on the Roof\" is a cinematic marvel, both in storytelling and in Jewish culture. This movie, in my opinion, is the best Jewish film in history. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen \"Fiddler on the Roof\", go check it out, especially if you're Jewish. I guarantee you'll love it!",

The heavyweight political analyst and cultural critic David P. Goldman (himself Jewish) has indicated he despises Fiddler, as a sentimentalist, corrupted version of the original works that inspired it. Persons who don't appreciate music or musicals may also be left cold by this 1971 movie. But such purist and crabbed views will gain little traction against the large and continuing cultural impact of this film, and the stage play that preceded it, which broke Broadway records in its day\u2014nor should they gain traction, in my opinion, as in some cases there is more to great art than historical fidelity to a source. Indeed, this work, although \"merely\" a musical, opens important dimensions of historical awareness for its audience that, even if rendered somewhat imperfectly, would in all likelihood otherwise have remained closed\u2014assuming the audience doesn't already know a lot about Russian history. The story revolves around the highly sympathetic figure of Tevye the Dairyman, played marvelously by Topol, who with his cows and lame horse (a companion more than a helper) ekes out a grinding existence for his wife and five daughters while reflecting on God's mysterious ways and the dramatic changes underway in his world. As the cruel and dreaded pogroms (persecutions, attacks and murders by Christians, sometimes abetted by the Tsar) reach his village and his daughters encounter and fall in love with young men of uncertain (and even forbidden) favor, Tevye must make a series of increasingly difficult choices, for himself and his family. Set in 1905 Russia as the Bolshevik Revolution winds up, this movie offers an excellent introduction---not a detailed study, but an introduction---to Russia's fascinating history in this period, while giving a great flavor of traditional Jewish village culture in the Pale of Settlement, the age-old homelands of Jews in rural Russia. Throughout, Fiddler offers plenty of Yiddish humor, known for its excellent and ironic joke-craft. According to Wikipedia the work is performed in high schools and play clubs over 500 times a year in the USA alone. With great music and a number of powerful, melodic and unforgettable songs, Fiddler on the Roof deserves its place in the canon of American classics.",

And faced with stress, a strong-minded parent can so easily (but mistakenly!) try to solve all these problems personally.But no: Tevye has the ability to stand back and see BOTH sides of the problem, and ultimately, he has the emotional courage to let go, so that each of his daughters is free to solve the problem as SHE thinks best.This is a warm, compassionate film.  If it is too long - as some users have suggested - this is to allow the full story to emerge in all its rich, cultural complexity.  The music considerably enhances the mood - sometimes sad, sometimes more jaunty.  A shorter film could not do justice to either the cultural background or the nature of the problems.The person of the fiddler is perhaps better understood not simply as a minor musical distraction, but rather as a symbol of survival or empowerment.

            "content": "It's a historical drama set in 1905-1906 in a small village in the Western Russian Empire, probably Ukraine. It follows a poor farm family in a primarily Jewish village in daily life as the Russian Revolution of 1905 begins to impact them.The primary characters are the family of Tevye (Topol) and Golde (Norma Crane) and their three oldest daughters, Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris), Hodel (Michele Marsh), and Chava (Neva Small). The daughters' future spouses are also significant--Motel (Leonard Frey), a tailor; Perchik (Paul Michael Glaser), a Jewish Bolshevik from outside the community; and Fyedka (Ray Lovelock), a Russian Orthodox farmer. An additional essential character is a local wealthy widowed butcher, Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann), who has his eye on Tzeitel. The fiddler on the roof (Tutte Lemkow) also stands for Jewish tradition.The film focuses on Tevye's struggle with changes occurring in his community and his family. He is a generously-spirited man who wishes he could have been a scholar. However, he is usually able to adapt, often with humor. Tevye and Golde had an arranged marriage and met on their wedding day. Twenty-five years later, they have accepted their station and brim with love for their five daughters though they often contend with each other. Yet, a level of optimism survives even as they experience difficulties and displacement.I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it. The music and the acting are powerful. Topol is a wonderful Tevye. Norma Crane is an excellent counter-point to Topol. And the three daughters have distinct personalities that work, as do their beaus. My strong emotional reaction to \"Fiddler on the Roof\" partly is because I can identify in some way with Perchik, in that two years before the movie came out, a woman followed me to a foreign land to get married. \"Fiddler on the Roof\" is my favorite musical and always brings me to tears.",

There is also If I Were a Rich Man which comes early on in the movie and is actually what hooks you with Topol doing a lovely dance with the dust flying off the balcony. I understand that in various musical performances over the last three decades, Chaim Topol has performed this song hundreds, perhaps thousands of times on stage. All I can say is, it looks fresh and he looks full of vitality when performing it in the movie. It really gives a burst of energy to the movie. I loved Sunrise, Sunset which is a little emotional.Topol gave a superb performance which unfortunately typecast him for the rest of his life. I do think he did more than his fair share of scene stealing though! The actor who played the butcher (Lazar Wolf) was really good as well (especially in To Life and the wedding scene). The middle daughter was really hot!!! I don't think people who don't enjoy musicals should watch this even though the plot is good. But, the songs are an important part of the appeal. I'm a sucker for King and I, Guys and Dolls, My Fair Lady etc. and I see this as the last great musical of that bygone era. Chicago was hit and miss.....",

However, the only thing that brings this film down is the fact is that they sway away from some of the smaller scenes that were in the original story. Director Norman Jewison has deprived some of the actors to display their talents more frequently and in fact, even cut out a song entitled \"The Rumor\".

            "content": "Based on the stories of Scholem Aleichem, this musical describes life in a Jewish shtetl in the Ukraine(?) around 1900 (?).  It is filled with the joy of living a simple life -- an Orthodox Jewish life -- where the most important religious events are (not centered around the synagogue, but) centered around the home and life cycle events:  birth, marriage, and (most important) the Sabbath.  This movie distills the essence of Eastern European Judaism.  Interestingly, the stories were written before Hitler almost completely wiped out Eastern European Jewry --- which adds to the nostalgia of the piece.  But Hitler failed in one respect:  many Eastern European Jews succeeded in transplanting themselves to the US, where, in spite of overt antisemitism, they and their Judaism flourished because of our wonderful US Constitution and an American spirit that fostered individualism and rewarded hard work.  So it is not surprising that Americans Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick created this homage to Scholem Aleichem and the Eastern European Jews Hitler tried to destroy.  Many of the songs in this musical are now part of an American culture that is (now) willing to accept Yiddish phrases and Jewish concepts.  Now, everyone knows that \"L'Chayim\" means \"To Life.\"  All young girls can identify with ... and laughingly reject ... \"Matchmaker, Matchmaker.\"  Every American that has had to work hard every day enjoys singing \"If I Were a Rich Man.\"    And songs like \"Sabbath prayer\" and \"Sunrise, Sunset\" have become staples of Jewish liturgy as well as songs with which every parent can identify.  My favorite song is \"Far from the Home I Love.\"   \nCould this film have been any better?  Perhaps.  If you have not heard it, you must listen to the audio recording of the 1964 Original Broadway Cast of Fiddler on the Roof (from RCA), which has Zero Mostel (singing the part of Tevye) as well as Julia Migenes, Bert Convy, and Beatrice Arthur.  I would have loved to see Zero Mostel in the movie, but Topol does an excellent job. Final note:  my mother was born in, grew up in, and emigrated from a small town in the Ukraine.  Her father had died there.  She had several older brothers who did not emigrate and were completely lost by 1945.  The memories must have been terribly painful for her because she vehemently refused to speak of them.  But she was must have been deeply affected by her childhood -- because she was a hard-working and dedicated mother -- willing to sacrifice her self in order to give her children the best possible future.  She was even willing to sacrifice some of the sacred Jewish traditions -- in order to assure that her family survives and thrives.  And that is just one of the movie's themes.  Another theme:  in the midst of pain and loss, there can still be hope.",

The musical score is wonderful, arranged and adapted to the screen by John Williams.This film was very popular when released to theaters, worldwide. It was a smash hit in Japan. One may find this odd, until you consider that the film is about the confrontations by old and young generations of matters of tradition. This is the soul of the film, and one of the reasons it played so well in so many countries. Everyone can relate to it's basic message.Jewison relates on the DVD how United Artists had pressured him to sign Zero Mostel for the role that Topal eventually got. Mostel was playing him on Broadway, and his performance was reportedly very good. But once Jewison saw Topal's performance on the London stage, he was convinced that he was the right man for the part. I must admit to agreeing with this, even though I'm a fan of Zero Mostel's work.The entire cast is good, and convincing in their roles. Jewison cast this film very carefully. Considering that it took 18 months to film, Norman Jewison was truly dedicated to this film. And it shows. I recommend this film most highly!",

I give the movie eight stars; the play I give ten stars.San Francisco now has the production on stage at the Golden Gate Theatre from Jan 27 to Feb. with Harvey Fierstein as Tevye, and Susan Cella as Golda; directed by Carole S. Hays. It was an excellent production. The live performance went beyond the sentimentality of the movie. Something is lost in that movie.The audience walks into Golden Gate Theatre, takes a seat, and sees a curtain depicted with a picture of a birch meadow. And immediately the viewer is expected to evoke the word and place \"Birkenau\" which means 'birch meadow.' Birkenau, also known as Auschwitz II.So by this simple aesthetic device, the musical shifts from 1905 Czarist pogroms to prefiguring the future Nazi atrocities. At the end of the play Czarist decree demands that Jews leaves their homeland. In defiance of \"Tradition,\" Chava has eloped with goy--non-Jew--Fyedka and at the end of the play they are on their way to Kracow--a scant 60 miles from Auschwitz. The viewer ends up with hope that as an assimilated Jew in Poland, she could be the one who survives the Nazi maw. At the time she leaves her city of Anatevka for Krakow, she would be about twenty--maybe younger--so in Poland, 1939, she would be a relatively young 59. Survival of \"Tradition\" and life expressed through the marriages, births, dances and \"one season following another laden with happiness and tears.\" The fiddler playing in a minor key, a key of mourning, underscores the prefigured tragedy.Sholom Aleichem (1859-1916)--Sholom Rabinovitch--wrote his stories about Jewish life in Czarist Russia of the late 1800s. Marc Chagall--1887-1985--evoked Jewish life in a Russian long gone with the Bolshevik revolution--but an evocation of Russian Jewish life, non-the-less. This San Francisco production very much used Chagall inspired scenery. While Hollywood no doubt used Chagall inspired scenery, the techno-mechno of Hollywood dilutes the impact; an impact that gets underlined, emphasized in a live theatrical performance.The very techno-mechno Hollywood reduces the impact; understatement is not the way of Hollywood. The 1940s noir-drama succeeded because of this understatement. The Hollywood musical relies, requires over the top and consequently something is lost. The live Stage Production can do something that escapes Hollywood and the San Francisco live performance produced excellence in their interpretation of Fiddler on the Roof.",

I grew up around community theater so it is still enjoyable for me, but for the average viewer it may induce sleep. Try to stick with it, though, as it gets really better halfway through.The best musicals carry on the plot for you during at least some of the songs if not all. Fiddler does have a handful of songs that add info, but since there are SEVERAL numbers, I yearned for either less of them or for them to tell me more. It does move the plot along with enough songs to still be a good, if bulky, musical.A good number is after Tevye discovers that his eldest daughter and the tailor pledged their love a year prior, and he's struck a deal for her with the butcher. That number was perfect. Next, though the number in the woods between the two lovebirds was nice and gave them a performance, but I got up and did something else, it bored me.Also, in the beginning, Tevye's barn number, while long, explains his love for knowledge. And the clothesline number with the daughters was pleasant and showed me how they all really felt about getting a match. And, the dream scene where Tevye explains to Golde about why the tailor should get Tzeitel instead of the butcher: this is IMO the best example in Fiddler of how the plot is enhanced by a musical number. \"Sunrise, Sunset\", Tzeitel's wedding, was my most favorite number. I loved the dance part.Those are some examples. In exchange for your perseverance, you will see excellent performances from everyone. A very young Paul Michael Glaser is really good and he amazed me, since all I knew of him was Starsky & Hutch.The serious subplot of Jewish persecution is also intriguing. It ain't all about just matchmaking.One more thing, it leaves you feeling very good. If you enjoy watching things like the Godfather Trilogy in one sitting, then you can handle Fiddler.",

I'm not Jewish so know little about the traditions of these people and accept that their beliefs are different to mine, that's alright and I was quite happy to just follow wherever the story took us. Unfortunately there isn't much of a story and even worse, it tales so long not to get there. Three hours. In fact I watched it in four sections as when I paused it for a break, I wasn't left thinking that I must see the next bit. In other words, it didn't hold my attention that long, and it\"s rather doleful as well. Oklahoma! It ain't. Topol gives a boisterous performance in the lead as Tevye, a poor Jewish peasant with a wife and I've forgotten how many daughters. The main bulk of the three hours concentrates on how his three oldest daughters enter into matrimony. I'd rather it had more good songs to break some of the gloomy storyline, as these romances are all hard going. It's a problem for a musical when the best song, in this case If I Were A Rich Man, is used up near the beginning as all the later songs are weaker. There is an anti-jewish theme running through the movie when the local police keep hounding the villagers which I found unpleasant for musical. There is no real feeling of being uplifted as we should be in a film like this so I only give 6 stars on this occasion. Things I liked were Topol, his eldest daughter who looks a little like Barbra Streisand, the scenery, nicely shot on location and Topol's big song. Pity I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as Streisand's own film Yentl.",

Back then big movies like FIDDLER were still shown on enormous screen movie theatres which looked like opera houses, all adding to the entertainment. Norman Jewison succeeded in bringing the taste and feel of 1905 Russia to the story; no detail was overlooked either in Jewish culture or Russian background; even more, he combined laughter with tears in so many of the scenes.  At the time, the movie was considered a bit long (The ending sequence of the heart-breaking eviction of the Jews from Russia comes to mind), but not by my standards.  The academy-award winning score and orchestrations by John Williams is excellent and this was not an easy task, bringing the Broadway show to screen.  All-in-all, I am hard pressed to find flaws in this movie and each time I see it it's better.  I have had FIDDLER nights where I show this movie to friends and the reward is to hear how much the movie is loved by everyone, no matter how many times we see it over the years.

It also hints about the upcoming Russian Revolution, as well as the Holocaust. As a result, the film had to be mostly filmed in Croatia. Several indoor scenes, such as the dream sequence, were filmed in England. It also is interesting that Mr. Jewisson is a non-Jew himself despite his name. Several songs from the movie soundtrack were performed in a different order than from the Broadway production. The film also got several Oscar nominations that year but faced tough competition, such as \"French Connection\".",

It is really more than enough to make it highly enjoyable. Fiddler on the roof takes place in Anatevka\u00a9\u00a5a small Jewish village in Russia. It centers around a dairyman\u00a9\u00a5Tevya and his five daughters. As a Jew, Tevya attempts to preserve his family\u00a1\u00afs traditions in the face of a changing world. And he must do hard work everyday without any comfort from his wife. Meanwhile, Tevya must choose between his own daughters\u00a1\u00af happiness and those beloved traditions that keep the outside world at bay. Tevya is real a good tolerant father. When he and his neighbors are forced to leave their homes by the subordinates of Czar, the traditional Tevya is aware that he must change his original living idea in face of new condition.Of course, the name of the movie is very significant when I meet it firstly. A fiddler on the roof. Sound crazy? \u00a1\u00b0But in our little village of Anatevaka, you might say every one of us is a fiddler on the roof, trying to scratch out a pleasant, simple tune without breaking his neck. It isn\u00a1\u00aft easy.\u00a1\u00b1 \u00a1\u00b0You may ask, why do we stay up there if it\u00a1\u00afs so dangerous? We stay because Anatevka is our home\u00a1\u00adAnd how do we keep our balance? That I can tell you in one word\u00a9\u00a5Tradition.\u00a1\u00b1 Indeed, that is the real reason for the name \u00a1\u00b0Fiddler on the roof\u00a1\u00b1. However, time changes. Man should change. Tradition? In other word, it means no development. It is no wonder that Jew have to go back to Jerusalem inevitably and helplessly.On the whole, \u00a1\u00b0Fiddler on the roof\u00a1\u00b1 deals with serious issues such as persecution, poverty and the struggle to hold on to one\u00a1\u00afs beliefs in the midst of a hostile and chaotic environment. In my mind, the movie has its weakness such as its very slow rhythm. It is so long that I felt little patient when I saw it firstly.",

            "review_title": "Song to a Changing World",
            "content": "Norman Jewison's adaptation of the Broadway musical by Arnold Perl and Joseph Stein (itself an adaptation of stories by Sholom Aleichem) was released at a pivotal moment of painful change for the genre of the Hollywood musical. It was clear from the high-profile failures of films like \"Hello, Dolly!\" and \"Doctor Doolittle\" that both audiences and critics were no longer interested in the roadshow spectacular that had fueled so many of the industry's biggest successes from the early fifties through to the late sixties. Now films like \"Easy Rider\" and \"Bonnie and Clyde\" were bringing in box office and awards recognition, auguring an era of grittier, more character-driven films made by a new breed of younger auteurs like Scorsese, De Palma, Altman, and Coppola. If there is a guiding principle to the 1970's in American cinema, it was an investigation into the subjectivity of the form to tell internal stories about dynamic characters. Could the musical survive in such a climate, or would it limp on through the next decade as an invisible dinosaur until the auteur era ended in the early 80's?I wasn't sure what to make of this film before watching it. I'd been aware of it for many years and had bleary half-memories of a live production I'd seen at the Smithsonian in much rowdier years. I'd always imagined it as a film that came out in the mid-sixties, not the early seventies, partly because of the jaunty catchiness of the most famous song, \"Tradition.\" To my surprise, \"Fiddler\" was released the same year as \"A Clockwork Orange\" and \"The French Connection.\" But once I actually watched the film, it began to fit in more and more with its era.The stakes of the film are ultimately internal. The arc that the main character Tevye travels (played by Chaim Topol with joviality, devotion, and a wry humor that nurses deep gulfs of anger and pain) shows him going from a man who swears by and relies upon the thousands of years of social, interpersonal, familial, and religious tradition, to a man who must discover a new flexibility to his beliefs. Jewison takes advantage of the inherently meta elements of the musical to give us scenes where he debates with himself and with God questions that challenge his identity as a father and his identity as a Jew.Jewison was wise to strip the original production of its overtly comedic tone. This is not to say that the humor is entirely removed, because to do so would be to deny so much of the characters' inherent resilience: irony and wit are their main defense against the harsh realities of being Jewish in the 1900's in Russia. Consider a scene toward the end when Tevye and the other village leaders are informed by a local goyim policeman that they must leave Anatevka, where many of them have lived their entire lives. The policeman leaves, the elders regard each other quietly until someone comes to the wry conclusion that, Well it was never that nice there to begin with.But the film never lets us off the hook the same way that the staged musical did. The pogroms and poverty are shown with stark realism, but the humor of the Jewish characters creates a deeply human tension that makes the film all the more potent and affecting.So many of the aforementioned Hollywood musicals of the fifties and sixties were content to simply provide lavish and spectacular experiences that audiences would not be able to get at home on the burgeoning television landscape. They were films shot in exotic locations or in extravagant sets where scores of highly trained dancers and musicians plied their trade in beautiful costumes. The comparison has already been made to that these were the antecedent to today's superhero film, but a growing cynicism due to the turmoil of the sixties left audiences with an appetite for something more real, something that they could see some of themselves in, that didn't just exist to distract them from the world outside the theater.\"Fiddler on the Roof\" came out a year before Bob Fosse's \"Cabaret,\" and together, these two musicals created a space for the classic genre to feasibly exist within this new audience expectation for complex character and subjective storytelling. They proved that the genre could be used in unique ways to plumb the depths of psychological experience with the same innovation as the other standards of American seventies cinema, because beneath the bold costumes, complex choreography, and catchy music, they were both about real human beings struggling to hold onto their sense of identity in a world chaotic with change.",

As opposed to the tedious Agnes DeMille-type dances in so many Musicals, all the dancing in \"Fiddler\" blends in with Folk Dances of the period. Despite his stage talent, Zero Mostel's personality would have overshadowed the character of Tevye on screen, and Topol's performance is the standard in current revivals.

I have to admit that Topol's dancing rivals the dancing of Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. (Joking) I have a live recording of Zero Mostel on Broadway in Fiddler on the roof and the cast was not in time with Zero on most of the songs. Sunrise Sunset was horribly off time and it wasn't the fault of the recording. They just didn't have it together. The movie is much cleaner in the songs due to the benefit of dubbing. The saddest thing about this movie is when I realized the time era this movie is set in and I thought about the future of the characters in their final locations and what they historically would have had to deal with being Jewish.

Indeed, its depth of content and characterisation, its sincere effort at chronicling Jewish life with music and humor are all aspects that have each contributed in their own way to the enrichment of cinema as a whole. When it was performed as a play, I am sure it did the same for theatre. That said, this film is special to me because of my sense of identification with the three daughters, especially Chava. Since, I myself happen to be the youngest of three sisters, I know from experience the friction caused between daughters and fathers because of differences over issues like marriage and free-will. I even come from a culture that assumes \"Tradition\" to be of paramount importance, before everything else... I felt deeply for what Tzeitel, Hodel and Chava felt in the film and at the same time, I knew well the predicament that Reb Tevye was in. His discussions with his self, his eventual acquiescence to their marriages was both humorous and heart-warming. Topol's rendering of Reb Tevye was amazing! He seemed absolutely natural and convincing in the part.\nPart of the success of this film(apart from the music), is definitely because of the way that era in Soviet history has been recreated - from the sleepy little village where our protagonists live(their costumes and occupations) to the towns where signs of unrest and revolution were more conspicuous. Everything has been very convincingly portrayed. The turn of events in this film is akin to those in 'The Sound of Music'. A good part of both films goes in songs, courtship and family interactions and then things take a turn, the drama reaches a climax or a crescendo. In 'SoM' it is because of World War II and here it is because of the Russian Revolution.\nNeedless to say, but the music is this film's trump card. It is what adds realism and that all-important element of authenticity. I doubt if the beauty and the little nuances of Jewish life have been more aptly portrayed in any other feature better than they are over here. I enjoyed all the songs - the one that Hodel(Michelle Marsh) sings before leaving Tevye to find Perchik in Siberia is especially beautiful. My only small grouse is that they didn't have enough of the fiddler and his music. The tune he plays is so good, more of it would have been perfect!Still, 'Fiddler on the Roof' is an unforgettable gem of a film - the best that ever was made!",

            "content": "FIDDLER ON THE ROOF has been a beloved musical for decades and the movie, which aired this past Saturday on Reel 13, was enormously successful when it first came out in 1971. I, however, have never been interested in the show. Though I do like some of the more famous songs (\"Matchmaker\" is catchy, \"If I Were a Rich Man\" is universally appealing and \"Sunrise, Sunset\" is beautifully written), I have always found the overall show to be pretty dull and very frustrating in terms of its repetitive nature.Director Norman Jewison (who also directed last week's THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING) did manage to do some interesting things in his adaptation, however. I liked how, on several occasions, he opted out of having characters sing out on screen. Instead, he used their voices non-diegetically, as if they were thinking the song in their heads. Even though the song itself is incredibly annoying, he turned the \"Tradition\" number into an effective montage introducing us to life in Anatevka. I also liked how Jewison handled the iconography of the fiddler itself. In the show, it's a bit heavy handed, but Jewison shoots it just right, keeping the fiddler mostly in background or shadow and cutting to him infrequently enough that he is an effective symbol for their way of life \u0096 subtle enough while maintaining its accessibility. To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of the talking to the camera device (has any film been able to pull this off except for FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF?). Additionally, Jewison employed the zoom lens several times throughout the film, a common tactic in the late 60's/early 70's, but it felt out of place in a period piece such as this.I was surprised at how weak many of the performances were \u0096 much of the cast had an air of theatricality about them, as if they were plucked right off the stage and never got accustomed to screen acting. The mother and the eldest daughter (a dead ringer for Barbra Streisand) are two exceptions. The primary exception, of course, is Topol as Tevye. Tevye is one of the most iconic characters is musical history \u0096 the male equivalent of Mama Rose \u0096 and Topol knocks it out of the park. He is funny, charmingly foolish, boisterous without being obnoxious, extremely caring and tender with a booming, powerful (singing and speaking) voice that perfectly fits this larger-than-life character. It ranks as one of the all-time best movie musical performances.In spite of all these positive qualities, FIDDLER the film still doesn't seem to overcome the flaws of FIDDLER the play. The second act is mostly strong with many emotionally impactful moments, but the build-up to get there is way too long and too slow. Several scenes in the film drag on mercilessly and some seem superfluous altogether (I don't think we needed the \"Wonder of Wonders\" number, for example). I imagine that Jewison and his team felt some pressure to include everything so the stage fans wouldn't be disappointed, but their priority in adapting the musical has to be to the film itself. When it's transferred to celluloid, it's a new animal and there are a different set of rules. More than anything, what FIDDLER really needed before relocating from Broadway was a good diet \u0096 to trim all the fat.(For more information on this or any other Reel 13, check out their website at www.reel13.org)",

Without a doubt, Topol's portrayal of Tevye, the Jewish peasant desperate to find good Jewish husbands for his daughters, is one of the greatest performances captured on film. He puts 100% into every little bit giving as perfect a performance at the end as he does at the start. For me, the highlight is still the ever-so-singable 'If I Were A Rich Man' which you almost can't sing without feeling the urge to shrug those shoulders in time with the music! But that sounds like I am dismissing the other wonderful songs which I most certainly am not. How could I when such beautiful melodies as that in 'Sunrise, Sunset' live long in the memory while the funnily desperate sentiments expressed in 'Matchmaker' just make you thankful we don't go through all that palaver to find a marriage partner these days... well, I didn't! :o) 1971, 35 years ago, not that far short of my entire lifetime, yet this musical feels as fresh and vibrant today as it did the day it was first released.I love musicals, I have a wide collection and play many instruments myself but nothing I have elsewhere in my collection nor anything I could ever produce on an instrument could ever come close to Fiddler. The greatest musical ever made into a film. Who cares that it goes on forever? Long may it do so! Cheers, Rob Barron",

While the music of some of the great musicals of the 1930's (several of the Astaire/Rodgers, Eddy/MacDonald, etc. films) is equally great or greater, the story line of Fiddler is exceptional. It says more about tradition, bending of tradition, family, husband-wife relationships, father-daughter relationships, the relationships of the powerful to the weaker, intolerance, etc., than most any other movie.If you don't laugh at Tevye's conversations with God or cry when he is so torn between his love for his daughter (who marries a Christian) and his own tradition, then you must be comatose. Although some may have been disappointed that Mostel did not get the role, I feel quite the opposite. Whereas Zero would have been equally great in the comic parts, he could not have carried out the pathos as Topol did.There will not be another musical such as this in our lifetime.",

He can accept the trends of change in society, but he will not deny his fundamental beliefs. Though he could bear the sadness of poverty or exile to Siberia, he cannot endure the loss of religious belief, and he counts his daughter as dead to him when she marries a catholic. Because of the great acting in this version of the movie, the emotions are real, and the great music helps bring that emotion out. This movie shows the sadness and the happiness of life.

All the musical performances are top notch, particularly that of Topol as Tevye, a role he fits so well and manages to bring alive.An intriguing plot shapes this movie, helping to elevate it above \"just another musical\" along with the aforementioned performances.

And I remember how I almost wished for a match maker when I was younger. And seeing how even though I'm now older and still single a match maker still at times doesn't seem like a bad idea. It shows events that could have really happened and it just tugs at your heart. A movie that can make you react to it like you are watching it for the very first time each time is a movie worth watching. And that is what this movie does to me. It deals with events that many people don't want to deal with but went on and it shows how some people may have dealt with it. It's in a class of it's own and worth while movie to see.",

It has great vitality, though of a different kind than one would experience with a musical such as Oklahoma! or Singing in the Rain.  The memorable songs don't have the flair of Rodgers & Hammerstein or Cole Porter, but they have deep meaning and evoke poignant reminders of both the wonderful traditions of the old world and the hateful, destructive behavior of man.  Favorite numbers include \"If I Were a Rich Man\" and \"Sunrise, Sunset,\" but the emotive \"Do You Love Me?\" and the wistful \"Matchmaker\" are great songs as well.Chaim Topol's big screen reprise of Tevye (Topol played him in London, but the character was played on Broadway by the great Zero Mostel) is superlative.

True, our knowledge of them goes back to the Old testament, and Christ, and Jews, but this musical pulls our minds out of the quagmire that holds them down, and relights our minds to see what we should have understood a long time ago. Anyone with a \"limited-understanding\" mind would have been given a solid jolt and wakening in a New York minute.Truly this movie is worth more than its salt, brought to it by the 3 Oscars added graciously to its portfolio.For starters, the feeling of antisemitism that prevailed against the Jews in Russia at the dawn of the 20th Cenntury. Here we have Tevye spelling out for us the strict orthodox values which we non-Jews are possibly, or were not possibly, aware of. The \"matchmaker\" concept gives birth to a strong turning point, early on in this film, for the concept of \"love\" affairs had not even seen the light of day in the Jewish universe. And the Jews themselves could not comprehend a marriage not arranged by the parents. We see that this sleaze is given a solid blow in this film, when 3 love marriages take place.And with each marriage of the daughters of Tevye, we see the binding chains of the orthodox beliefs surrounding the Jews, given more weakening blows which eventually break them completely.Breaking away from the dogmatic society. We see three daughters of Tevye burn it into their minds that only true love, as opposed to the choices of the matchmaker/parents, can really bring happiness on its wings - wings which could also signal hardship, ostracism from the family. Crucial elements that helped reshape our idea/ignorance about the Jews. Elements that were worth the bargain with sacrificing your beliefs/dogmas for a more liberal practical approach.This success, won by this film, flies against the flow of Jewish conventionalism. This is one comedy romantic flick which nicely plays up the dogmatic side of the Jewish conventions, and simultaneously juxtaposes it with the practical side of the Christian beliefs, and shows determination at breaking out of that shell of thought.A truly touching film for all to see.",

I could watch this movie a million times if my family would let me.  Topol is hysterical as Tevye.  He unconciously obeys his religion, he has trouble coping with change, and he wishes life were better. Tevye is a pure example of a person who is obedient without question. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is the bottle dance.  It is timeless. I also like the barroom dance scene.  I have always enjoyed the dance numbers that are very athletic. I also think that Norma Crane's Golde is wonderful.  You see, she is a cold woman on the outside, but if you get to the center of her personality, you can tell she is an insecure but a loving woman who only wants the best for her family.  That voice too, what woman has that deep and beautiful of a voice? I thought the songs were wonderful, and I didn't know they had to cut out thirty minutes.  My high school put on Fiddler on the Roof and they included these songs.  I agree they were very dumb, and the movie functions quite well without them. The movie also gives us a good history lesson and a lesson in ethics.  We should not persecute someone because of their faith, skin color, anything. I am not Jewish but I am of a religion that has also suffered persecution and still does; I am Mormon.  Mormons and Jews seem to get along because we are fellow sufferers. Fiddler on the Roof is one of my favorite musicals, along with \"The King and I\", \"The Sound of Music\", \"Mary Poppins\", \"My Fair Lady\", \"The Music Man\", and \"West Side Story\". I think Fiddler deserved more Oscars than it got.  But it seems the Academy doesn't enjoy movies that are actually good.  Topol deserved an Oscar, so did Leonard Frey, and I think that Norma Crane should have at least been nominated. I also enjoy this movie because it's appropriate for everyone to watch.  It doesn't have graphic violence, sex, nudity, or anything objectionable. See this movie!  It's too good to miss.",

Sadly, some of the cast are now gone, but boy did they leave a good impression.The plight of Jews was not only in WW2 but throughout history and this film depicts the Russian pograms period of the early 20th century. Tevye also grapples with changing traditions while trying to feed a wife and 5 daughters. Another beautiful film in this same mode is Dr Zchivago, also set in Russia around the revolutionary era.My favourite scene in this film is the wedding with the exceptional skill of the bottle dancers on show, plus the wedding song. The fiddler on the roof of course, is a symbol of Tevye's dreams and hopes for his village and family to remain happy and safe in troubled times and to hang on to much beloved traditions. How sad is the last scene as well as the villagers leave their homes and begin the long road to find safety.

However, with a home theater system, no doubt you will be disappointed in the laser disks and VHS versions!  Why?  Because often their 'stereophonic' channels were quite crippled with phasing problems.  That is, some mics or mixers used in the final mix-downs were themselves out of phase. What this does is to destroy the 'stereo acoustical immaging of LEFT RIGHT CENTER BASS AND REAR channels.  We noticed this at a radio station when we first got the PHONOGRAPH & TAPE CASSETTE versions.  A terrible shame.

It is a lot harder to do that with watching a video of it at home. Also I wouldn't say this is a comedy. It is a musical drama. And I give it 10 out of 10. I own the video, & bought it as soon as it became available. Prior to purchasing it, I watched it every time it came on TV. It is a brilliant production, the set is well done, showing a poor tired village who is regularly being harassed by their non-Jewish counterparts in Czarist Russia. When you consider the story, this can't be a comedy. If it was as bad as johnm_001 states, why was it nominated for so many awards?",

Very beautiful.The movie is the history of the classic Jewish family on the East of Europe in the XIX century. But is not only a history of a single family in a single village, is the history of the Jewish people. Show you the ideology of the classic Jews, how was changing his minds, how they lived and coexist (and not) with the non Jewish people (they belonged to the Orthodox Church). And finally, how they had to go, how they were expelled from there land.And the characters are charming to. Tevye, Who nobody obeys him, and he seems dominated for his wife, Golde. The daughters of Tevy symbolize the changes, the first got married with no matchmaker, and was hard to admit. The second with a crazy Marxist Jew, who fought against the classical values and tradition. And the younger, Chava, with a Non Jew. That was terrible for Tevye, he couldn't admit that. All his values going to hell. The songs are really nice. And even if the movie show you something terrible (how was the pogroms), the movie has to a positive message, give you hope.",

The Jews resilience and reliance on God to carry them through is all they had. I don't have a problem with the length of the movie.

Don't get me wrong, Topol is great as Tevye, but I can hardly imagine what Zero Mostel must've brought to the role. Besides that one small thing, I am also in love with Fiddler. How many young people even know what a shtetl is nowadays? Probably not many. And the sad truth is, unlike many other European immigrants who can go back to explore the villages of their ancestors, Jews cannot. Of course, Fiddler is heavily romanticized, but it gives us a small picture of the \"old country\". Without this movie, the idea of the shtetl might've been lost to future generations. The fact that it was superbly directed (by aptly named Norman Jewison - who by the way wasn't Jewish), acted, choreographed, and adapted to the screen, is just non-dairy icing on the cake.",

            "content": "I was shocked by the fact that I enjoyed this film when considering the fact that I have a real antipathy for musicals, particularly those released in the 1970s such as Cabaret (1972) and All That Jazz (1979). While this film still had many of the issues of the genre in that it was over long and thin on plot the songs were catchy, the performances were spirited and the characters were genuinely charming as they went about their lives in a ridiculously thin plot. Modern audiences may not flock to lengthy musicals the way they did in the 1960s and 1970s but this is one that has actually held up to modern scrutiny and has the power to entertain.\n\nIn the early 1900s Jewish patriarch Tevye, Chaim Topol, leads his poor family in the small town of Anatevka, Ukraine where tradition is valued above all else. His primary concern is marrying off his three adult daughters to suitors deemed acceptable by matchmaker Yente, Molly Picon, as he contends with his overbearing wife Golde, Norma Crane. Eldest daughter Tzeitel, Rosalind Harris, is in love with poor tailor Motel Kamzoil, Leonard Frey, which means that her father has to break off a planned engagement to the older Lazar Wolf, Paul Mann. His second daughter Hodel, Michele Marsh, falls in love with Communist Perchik, Paul Michael Glaser, whose lack of financial stability leaves her parents concerned. His third daughter Chava, Neva Small, commits the ultimate sin by wanting to marry gentile Fyedka, Raymond Lovelock. This proves to be the last straw for her father but as anti-Semitic tensions brew in the background he may have bigger problems to face than just the marriages of his daughters.\n\nWhat differentiates the film from other musicals is that it actually allows for dialogue and plot in between songs and puts the dance numbers to good use when they do pop up now and then. Sure some of the songs seem a little repetitive but who isn't charmed by \"If I Were a Rich Man\" and \"Do You Love Me?\" as testaments to the power of a strong hook. I was initially concerned by the lack of real choreography during the song and dance numbers as Tevye is largely confined to kicking up his legs and presenting his jazz hands upward but Jerome Robbins later proves to have a few more tricks up his sleeve. By the time we reach the big group dance numbers, most notably that which occurs at Tzeitel's wedding, you really feel the exuberance of the highly complex dance numbers and director Norman Jewison's frenzied camerawork captures all of the movement well.\n\nFurthermore the plot was actually involving as while you could argue that it is repetitive as we see the same thing occur not one, not two but three times as Roger Ebert did but there is a joy in seeing love triumph above all else. Each of the three couples have their own unique charm as while we only get to see a few scenes of each couple interacting the young actors portray their characters sweetly and with simple evocation that is rare in modern acting. Why complain when what we get is so enjoyable? I am always a fan of simplistic love stories and while I have seen each of the three conflicts played out in other, better films there was enough here with Topol's big, emotional performance to keep me engaged. You know that each of these women will end up with the man they love but there is some interest in seeing how their relationships with their parents are different. By all accounts the film adheres pretty closely to the hit stage play and is all the better for it because although the film's scope is expanded and we feel as though we are watching more than just a filmed stage play it retains the liveliness of a live performance.\n\n1971 produced an incredibly strong Best Picture lineup and this was among the top quality productions that was honored as while it doesn't reach the heights of The Last Picture Show (1971) and A Clockwork Orange (1971) it is still oddly terrific. To my mind this is overlooked by contemporary viewers and deserves more appreciation.",

I were a wealthy MAAAAAN?! \ud83c\udfb6\n\nTevye is a farmer and milkman with a wife and 5 daughters living in a Jewish village in Russia in 1905.  Tevye's just trying to get by each day when suddenly 3 of his daughters decide they want to get married.  And...... well, that's the whole plot basically.\n\nI thought this movie was excellent!\n\nI knew 2 songs, only heard one of them completely and had no idea what kind of movie this would be.  I wondered if it would be cornball and tough to take seriously or conversely too serious with no element of fun.\n\nTurns out... it's a beautiful mix of comedy and drama.  A musical dramedy!\n\nI'll get right to the best thing in the movie and that's Topol as Tevye.  Tevye looks about 65 but Topol was only 36 when he made this movie, that alone makes it a great performance.  It's like Russell Crowe playing a much older man in The Insider.  But Christ almighty is he good in this movie.  He's from Palestine, he couldn't even speak English the first time he went up for playing Tevye on the stage and you'd never know it in this.\n\nHe's gotta be funny, serious.... AND sing!  And Topol can manage all 3.  \n\nTevye in this movie is one of my new favorite protagonists in movies, it's impossible not to like this guy and relate to him just wanting things to go as smooth as possible in his life... and of course they DON'T!\n\nTevye is constantly talking to God in this movie... and singing to him of course.  Sometimes in the middle of a conversation, he'll look to the heavens to keep God in the mix and EVERY aside like that was a 10 out of 10 moment.  It's ALMOST like breaking the 4th wall but not really and it works beautifully.  He doesn't even have to SAY anything he'll just be talking to someone and then look at the sky as if to say \"Can you believe this bullshit?\"  He's like the original Deadpool!  Ya know if.... Deadpool was an elderly Jewish milkman in turn of the century Russia.\n\nNow I love Gene Hackman in The French Connection...... but I might have voted for Topol to win the Oscar he was nominated for instead.\n\nNorma Crane plays his wife Golde and I was shocked how good SHE was in this movie!  I'd never seen her before and it's probably because she died shortly after making this movie at the age of 44, such a shame.  But she's outstanding here as Golde who's tough as hell very much runs the house and she doesn't take any shit.... but you can tell she and Tevye love each other.... I know they do, they have a whole song about how much they still love each other than made me well up with tears for the one time in the movie.\n\nMy favorite scene is one with the two of them.  Where Tevye has to figure out a way to tell Golde that their daughter's arranged marriage is off.... and it's this entire musical number in a dream scene where Tevye concocts this horseshit story that Golde's relatives came to him in a dream to tell him she shouldn't marry this butcher in town.  And the butcher's widow shows up as a shrieking banshee to further warn against this and it's a FANTASTIC scene!\n\nNobody in the cast is bad, a 70s Hollywood musical and nobody drops the ball.... that's a lucky break, man.  Always seems to be one person in every musical where it's like \"OK... they don't belong.\"  But nope, everything's great in this.\n\nThen there's the music.  If you don't come out of this movie whistling the tune of \"If I Were a Rich Man...\" then you weren't listening.  What a great and catchy score, adapted from the play into a film by... John Williams who won an Oscar for the music in this movie.\n\nNorman Jewison directed the movie and he hasn't made a movie I haven't liked yet with In the Heat of the Night, Moonstruck and now this.  When they're not singing this is a proper drama with a great naturalistic tone.  It's a rare musical where you could take the songs out and it'd STILL be a great movie, probably.\n\nThe Oscar winning cinematography by Oswald Morris is GORGEOUS!  That shot where we get the credits playing over... the fiddler on the roof playing as the sun is setting... now THAT is a perfect shot.  There's a lot of shots like that in the movie, I couldn't get over how good this movie looks.\n\n3 hours long is a bit much, but it's one of those movies where even if I think it's too long... I wouldn't wanna cut anything out, it's too good.\n\nI loved Fiddler on the Roof, such a good movie.",

            "content": "A heartfelt musical about the Jewish cause.\n\nNorman Jewison directs Fiddler on the Roof as a personal journey for one Jewish father named Tevye (Topol). It chronicles a Jewish family in the Ukraine from the early 1900's. I love how Jewison films Tevye's monologues to himself and the audience. The endlessly crafty cinematography, epic sweeping panning shots, complexly choreographed dance sequences, and tender acting performances all come together nicely in Fiddler on the Roof.\n\nNot to mention, this is a musical! The music is memorable and funny, while also conveying the sincere emotions and deeply held beliefs of these people. It harkens back to traditional Jewish values and melodies. I love the score and the singing alike. I think most audiences will at least enjoy the songs scattered throughout Fiddler on the Roof.\n\nAbove all, I must credit Topol. He is an incredible actor who carries the majority of the film. Fiddler on the Roof is told right alongside him. We get his thoughts, feelings, and perspectives on every issue and moment. He conveys strict Jewish tradition, while also desiring to change for modern times. Topol's performance is one for the ages as he captures the harshness necessary for the desperate times, while simultaneously depicting a tender and understanding father. You feel and empathize for his cause. Topol makes you laugh and sing, but you truly come to understand and respect him as a man. This is complex characterization at its finest. Topol should be proud of his magnificent contribution to cinematic excellence and Jewish history.\n\nIn short, Fiddler on the Roof is a timeless classic. Both beautiful and enjoyable as a musical as well as demonstrating Jewison's mastery of filmmaking. Fiddler on the Roof is a movie you must watch before you die, not because you are told to, but rather because it is so engaging and important. Enjoy!",

Topol's understated performance is in direct contrast to Mostel, whose over-the-top antics worked best on stage.

About a Jewish patriarch who must deal with his daughters' ideas of marriage, this tale is at turns lively, intelligent, thoughtful, funny, and, finally, heartbreaking.  Chaim Topol, recreating his role from the London cast, provides a charismatic, energetic performance as the lead character Tevye, an initially proud father figure whose pride gradually goes to pieces as he is forced to bend over backwards for the sake of his children's happiness, and deals with the czarists who threaten to drive the whole Jewish race out of his hometown of Anatevka.  All this is interspersed by buoyant and emotionally charged musical numbers which breathe just as much heart and soul into an already compelling piece of drama.  Norman Jewison does an excellent job of transitioning the stage play into a full length movie; the cinematography especially brings out the rustic tones of Anatevka and the Russian setting.  The only minor criticisms one might have is that the film is quite long, clocking in at slightly over three hours and some dance sequences do feel stretched out, but on the other hand, it's hard to imagine this film without them.  All in all, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF is both a classic musical and an equally fantastic movie that treats its source material with the love and care it deserves.  I highly recommend it, especially for fans of great singing, dancing, and tragedy.",

It also recognizes that story, in a film like this, basically means shit all in comparison to the characters. Fiddler on the Roof has never, and will never be recognized for having a complex plot with plenty happening (although, to be fair, there IS a lot going on). This is a story propelled by characters. Their motivations, their comforts and desire for change in some respects, are what takes the forefront in both the stage show and the film. The music is just as rousing as ever, having stood the test of time at this point and becoming a musical theater staple. I also can't praise Topol enough. He, in my eye, will always be the ideal Tevye on stage and screen. It's a sentimental, rousing, yet sometimes quaint look at a village on the edge of change.",

Weather you enjoy or not musicals, i personally can't stand most of them, be ready for a slice of film making like only they knew how to cook them back in the days. Sure it stands for old fashion values and traditional family life but Topol is magnificent and manages to stay incredibly lovable even when he loses his temper. The rest of the cast is amazingly good and each of the characters feel true to his/her convictions. The cinematography, the score, the sets, the costumes, everything here is perfectly crafted to offer one of these monumental entertainment for the whole family. Shot in 1971, the film still stands as one of the best musicals ever made on screen. Brilliant, inventive, traditional but avant-garde in a way, this is a touching, daring and marvelous ensemble.  Definitely a timeless must see.",

            "content": "Although I was only familiar with Chaim Topol as playing the role of Dr. Hans Zarkov in Flash Gordon, one of my all time favourite films, Fiddler on the Roof sounded interesting enough to bring me in and have me witness his greatest talents.\n\nFiddler on the Roof immediately strikes the viewers' interest as it opens, because it immediately shows off its strong visuals, talented acting a well composed musical score which are some of the film's best elements. Yet possibly the greatest is the directional work of Norman Jewison who combined all these into making Fiddler on the Roof an incredible visual and auditory experience which captures the spirit of the original play, the educational culture of its story and the powerful entertainment value that it holds. His direction is just utterly some of his true best and he exercises a true understanding of importance within Jewish culture as the director of Fiddler on the Roof.\nThe story\nYou can tell that the Fiddler on the Roof script clearly doesn't deviate far from its theatrical roots because it clearly has many of the charming anecdotes written for a stage production and all of the clever and charming jokes and friendly characters that would have made the original play so widely successful. It's so charmingly written and so cleverly humourous in such a quirky way, and the characters are all interesting which makes it easy to connect to them and hope for their best. And all this combined makes it a powerful experience in entertainment because when a viewer genuinely cares for the characters it makes it a stronger and more beneficial experience to them, as was the case with me watching Fiddler in the Roof.\nAnd the story is a fascinating one. Like I said, it explores the complicated culture of the time of 1905 and the context of a Jewish community living within Tsarist Russia, and the trouble that comes with it. The tale starts so spirited and energetic which fills audiences with glee and life so that they feel what it is to be a Fiddler on the Roof, and it later is struck down by the drama of the film so the depressing atmosphere of the story is reflected in the depressing feeling the viewer gets as he or she experiences the sadness of what it is to be a poor Jewish person in Tsarist Russia. So Fiddler on the Roof is both happy and joyful while also sad and depressing, and it's an emotional roller coaster. And definitely a good one, because a musical that can touch you like Fiddler on the Roof and make you feel as much as it did is worth watching and learning from. It explores what it is to have optimism and suddenly be faced with shocking nihilism, so it's a powerhouse dramatic film. Yet even as it does this it exits on a high note, a beautiful one which may have viewers smiling like it did for me. Really, the story in Fiddler on the Roof is one deserving of immense praise for its themes and development.\nThe production design in Fiddler on the Roof is greatly convincing since the town of Anatevka and the people within it feel genuine, and of course the costumes make them feel more humane as characters which makes them easier to connect to. All the sights in Fiddler on the Roof are beautiful so it's a strongly appealing visual experience. The cinematography is excellent too, and the film is edited in perfect timing for the musical scenes especially so that it's basically a magical musical.\nAnd the musical score in Fiddler on the Roof is absolutely hypnotic. Its beautifully written, composed with skill and sung with the voice of true magicians of theatrics. It's incredibly beautiful, and the voice talents of its cast are just perfect. But their acting talents managed to match that.\n\nChaim Topol has the vocal talent of a an old wise man whose voice itself had grown a beard. His Israeli accent and low tone of voice is so energetic and charming that it sucks the viewer into loving Tevye the Milkman in every situation. See, Chaim Topol has an unmatchable theatrical energy in him and such a friendly smile which made him shine as he danced during his solo performance of \"If I Was a Rich Man\". His performance is some of the most spirited and strongly dramatic in musical cinema history, and Chaim Topol proves that he was born to play Tevye in an deservingly Academy Award nominated performance. \nLeonard Frey also managed to make a memorable supporting role since he had a real passion in him which showed off in his chemistry with Chaim Topol and Rosalind Harris, and he really has a sense of love in him for Tzeitel which makes it a thoroughly combining emotional performance which ensures that the love in the story is just refreshing. He is a memorable face from Fiddler on the Roof.\nRosalind Harris was also terrific because she captured the innocent spirit of Tzeitel very well and sung majestically which made her an appealing presence to the eyes and the ears.\nNorma Crane was also a powerful addition to the cast, as was Paul Mann.\nMichael Glaser was also great.\nReally, the entire cast was strong and energetic without one actor ever slipping up.\n\nSo although the latter part of the film is less energetic and a little slower than the former, Fiddler on the Roof is an exceptional film adaptation of a classical play which educates and entertains while it mesmerises viewers with its",

            "content": "A terrific musical, which doesn't end the typical happy way most do, and pushes the boundaries of contemporary filmmaking, creating several unigue trademark camera angles and scene work that appeal to the eye and are pleasantly humorous.\r\n\r\nTopol shines as Tevye, his life-long role, the main character of Fiddler and a troubled man at that. As he puts it, 'blessed' with five daughters and a poor living condition, he delivers the milk around his traditional jewish village Anatevka, friendly with all the locals who share each others' tales. When he is asked by the butcher for his blessing to marry his eldest daughter Tzeitel, this begins a whirlwind of events for Tevye, including a poor tailor in love with Tzeitel, his second daughter leaving home to marry a poor revolutionist, his third daughter marrying a russian, therefore disowned, and the russian forcing the whole town of Anatevka to leave and find somewhere else to live. \r\n\r\nMany supporting characters are involved to support jokes and scenes in their own ways, including the classic beggarman, the old matchmaker woman Yante, the aggravated butcher Lazar Wolf, the Rabbi, the Constable and Golde, Tevye's wife, who all provide character development for Tevye, and challenge his beliefs and needs throughout.\r\n\r\nIn a touching finale, we see how the events of the past effect on the future, when the town is forced the evacuate by the Russians, and Tevye's family is split apart due to travelling plans and emotional trouble, which prompts saddened singing and unenthusiastic dancing. All of which is intended of course.\r\n\r\nHugely ejoyable, great singing, great acting and great cast. The songs are fantastic, especially emotionally-charged 'Sunrise, Sunset'.",

            "content": "Hey now, you need to be careful when fiddling around on the roof, because it's dangerous, and by that, I don't mean that you could fall off the roof while messing around, I mean that if you start playing a fiddle on your roof nowadays, you're not likely to find enough 1905 tolerance to keep someone from throwing stuff at you, like a dreidel or something. Something along those lines is probably what would be thrown in this film, because if this film is phenomenal in no other regard, then it is phenomenally Jewish. Well, in all fairness, it is Yiddish, and there doesn't appear to be a way to not make something Yiddish really, really Jewish, though it certainly doesn't help that this film is directed and produced by a guy named, of all things, Norman [u]Jew[/u]ison; and the best part is that this dude's not even Jewish. Shoot, no wonder he did \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" right after this; he was getting confused as a Jew enough without this film under his belt. Actually, considering that this film is also a musical, I don't think that \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" so much inspired people to think that Jewison isn't Jewish, as much as it inspired people to think that Jewison was doing some kind of religious musical trilogy, which is probably why \"Rollerball\" was a bit of a disappointment, because Jewison went way off from the original play and didn't have anyone bust out into a song about Hinduism while playing a violent futuristic sport in which they skate or motorcylce around with spiked armor while throwing steel balls around. I can think of plenty of people who would say that if \"Rollerball\" really was based off of a Hindu musical, and faithfully, then it still wouldn't have been as stupid as the 2002 remake. Speaking of going off topic, it's time we cut back to talking about the film I'm supposed to be talking about, and speaking of staying faithful, you know the drill: movie good, not great, held back by quite a few flaws, so let us stop \"fiddling\" around and get right into this thing, because something pertaining to this film should probably be short and to the point.\r\n\r\nThe film has been called immensely faithful to the play on which it's based, and sure enough, it is extremely faithful to its stage counterpart, or at least I can safely presume that, because although I have, of course, not had the opportunity to see the original stage play, it's clear as day that this film is a faithful adaptation, as it is so very faithful to theatrics in general, though perhaps to a fault. Norman Jewison drenches this film in an extremely theatrical feel, pumping it with that kind of overwhelming spirit that really doesn't translate all that well to film, thus leaving the perhaps overly lively dialogue and forced incorporation of musical numbers to come off as rather awkward and detrimental to the film's compellingness, as it taints a conflicting atmosphere. Now, it's not like the story is terribly consequential to begin with, yet the theatrical livliness of the film dilutes conflict, and with it compellingness, as well as the necessity for the film to be as long, or rather, as overlong as it is. Whether it be because of the many forced overlong musical numbers or because of the film's staying faithful to the theatrical sensibility of dragging things out so that people don't find their money squandered on an all too brief theatrical affair, the film achieves its 3-hour runtime forcefully, maybe not to where it finds itself meditating upon total nothingness or especially expendable material, but still to where it finds its momentum further hurt, and the unevenness of the pacing doesn't help either. With all of my complaining about the film being so overlong, quite often, certain scenes feel relatively tight, thus leaving incorporation of the overlong moments that give this film its excessive length to fall into play uncomfortably and render the film's momentum to further run askew. Now, looking at the premise, it's not like this film held the potential of being terribly outstanding, yet it does deserve to be handled better than it is, being overlong and overblown to the point of losing some steam and, by extension, substance impact. However, within entertainment value lays this film's redemption, for although the film is so overwhelming, with not quite enough dramatic bite to it, it remains an immensely enjoyable film, being able to back up its problematic theatrics, for the most part.\r\n\r\nAs I said, Norman Jewison stays faithful to the original play by actively drenching the film in theatrics, and there's no not doing that as much as he does without problems arising, so of course this film was doomed to get too lively for its own good, yet many genuinely good things can emerge from this livliness, if of course you have the entertainment value to back up the theatrics. Well, as sure as sunshine, Jewison compensates for his making the film so unapologetically theatrical by making it wildly entertaining, breathing into this film fiery charisma and flare that reflects theatrical grandness and keeps the film thoroughly engaging and delightfully lively, especially when it comes to the musical sequences. Though as overlong, overused and rather forced as the numbers found in most every musical of this type, the musical numbers in this film are outstanding, with Sheldon Harnick's memorably catchy lyrics and Jerry Bock's sweeping compositions going considerably well-executed, and complimented by relatively simple yet still dazzling set pieces that keep you tapping your toes and having a grand time, even if the numbers do often throw off the focus on the film's substance a bit, no matter how much the lyrics \"pertain\" to the scenario at hand. Of course, when the story does fall into play, while its effectiveness is hurt by the uneven pacing, bloating and theatrics, it remains a strong and fascinating story, with resonance that, when actually handled well enough by Jewison's storytelling, really does ring home effectively and memorably, and the film owes much of its story's effectiveness to the character aspects. There are many characters within this film, and they're all so very distinct, colorful and memorable, largely thanks to their faithfully colorful portrayal. Now, certain performances are better than others, with a few performances falling a bit flat, being that this film is so theatrical, yet most everyone incorporates distinct charisma - while really playing up collective charisma through razor-sharp chemisty -, with leading man Chaim Topol particularly owning the show with his delightfully boastful, blazingly charismatic and, on occasions, a touch dramatically soulful portrayal of Tevye the dairyman, a good-hearted and considerably faithful man of tradition and experience who still has much to learn, and will learn during the journey through faith, tradition and humanity around which this film's worthy story and themes are built. Again, the film's story isn't especially outstanding, though it does deserve better than this film's presentation, yet what the film is presenting is so immensely charming, wildly entertaining and delightfully theatrical that, by the end, it's kind of hard to mind the film's excessiveness, as you'll ultimately walk away rewarded by a genuinely good time.\r\n\r\nBottom line, the film is perhaps too theatrical for its own good, with writing and tones that faithfully translate from stage to the screen with moderate awkwardness that proves detrimental to the effectiveness of the film's substance, which is further tainted by an excessive length and uneven pacing that helps in keeping the final product from really hitting home, which isn't to say that the final product doesn't strike a chord in the least, as the film really does resonate much more often than it doesn't, boasting outstanding musical numbers and immense entertainment value, spawned by the strong story and lively concepts, brought to colorful life by Norman Jewison's delightfully charming direction and a slew of distinct, charismatic and memorable performances - the most memorable of which being by the sparklingly charming Chaim Topol -, thus leaving \"Fiddler on the Roof\" to stand firm as a thoroughly wildly entertaining and, at times, reasonably resonant portrait on a new age's affects on tradition.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

            "content": "If their were ever a definition for the word masterpiece, Fiddler on the Roof would be it. This movie has everything imaginable. One of the greatest musical films ever created and arguably the best. Rated by many as the number one film depicting the Jewish people. And many secular Jews often looked to this film as their main knowledge and spiritual feelings about their own religion. \nThe acting, dialogue and singing by each actor/actress are perfection. The songs are very memorable and quite great. \nThe movie deals with a family embodied in strict religious tradition. Tevye, the main character has a wife and five daughters. Struggling with not having any sons to help him tend his livestock and milk services. While even acting as a horse to his own horse! Still, he maintains a content outlook having his faith, town folk and family to keep him at ease. This all becomes tested when three of his oldest daughters marry men he would rather them not. Tradition is broken quite a few times, not to mention the Russian establishment harassing and eventually expelling his family and entire town at the end. \nThat is the most narrow, gist summary of this film. Their is so much more and even my own words cannot describe the greatness of this movie. And if I even attempt to try, and tell you everything wonderful about it and what makes it so great. I'm afraid this review of mine will be many times longer. \nThe movie tests humbleness and faith vs coveting, love, persecution and with outstanding depth, character analysis and strong perseverance allows a people written with historical persecution to carry on once again. The fiddlers violin, along with the powerful emotions heard in every song transcends this aspect of the Jews remarkably. \nThe people who made this didn't just perform plastic surgery, they performed brain surgery and everything else.\nMy favorite movie of all time.",

But enough about that, let's finally finish the whole VHS movie that were from that bag with Fiddler on the Roof.\r\n\r\nPlot: Tevye is a poor milkman living in the Jewish town of Anatevka. He lives with his wife Golde and his five daughters. In Anatevka, there is a matchmaker named Yente to decide who should marry who. And she recently decided that Tevye's oldest daughter Tzeitel should marry Anatevka's very rich yet old butcher, Lazar wolf. Tevye agrees, but Tzeitel wants to marry the very young but poor tailor Motel. After begging to Tevye, he agrees to let Motel and Tzeitel marry. From there Tevye faces many other changes in his life from the things that happen to some of his other daughters to what happens to Anatevka.\r\n\r\nI like the movie and I love the musical. The characters are lovable, the story is good and the music and dancing are a lot of fun. I do admit that it may be a little longer than it may need to be. There are some very minor scenes that while are a little helpful to the story at some points, removing them from the film wouldn't be a terrible loss to me. But either way sort of work regardless. And even then it's an excellent film filled with music, dancing and all around a lot of fun to watch. A very well done adaption of the Broadway musical.\r\n\r\nActor/Character:\r\nTopol/Tevye: Tevye was a very fun character in particular. He was a caring father and liked to talk to The Lord an awful lot about the things that happened to him, and he was a good character all around to used for showing the world that the people of Anatevka lived in and to show what happened with all of the change that would happen to either to him or his entire town. He may not have deserved an oscar for his performance, but Topol still did an excellent job worthy of at least being nominated for his performance.\r\n\r\nMusic: Yeah, like I already said, the music is a lot of fun. I mean hopefully a lot of you are familiar with some of the music already, at least with the song \"If I were a Rich Man\" but there's also \"Tradition\", \"Miracle of Miracles\", \"To Life\", and \"Tevye's Dream\". The music is just so awesome and memorable.\r\n\r\nEditing: I really enjoyed the editing. Especially during Tradition with the rhythm if you will in some of the cuts that they did during that scene. But during Tevye's dream, there were two points where they show a goat in the dream for really no reason. So I didn't see any point in that.\r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for Fiddler on the Roof, it may be a little long and a slight bit of the editing didn't make sense, but it's still an excellent film with a nice story, lovable characters, and spectacular music that is worth remembering.",

Fiddler manages one of the tougher balancing acts in cinema by creating catchy tunes and a thought-provoking storyline. Not only is the story interesting it is also a topical piece that will actually make viewers think about their religious tolerance.\n\nIt feels like the only reason this movie works so well is the character of Tevye. He is like the perfect common man that everyone can relate to. He dreams of being rich, he loves his family, and he struggles to balance his religious beliefs with his actions. Having such a lovable guy in the lead role makes it easy for the audience to put themselves in his shoes and sympathize with what he goes through. Topol will probably be remembered for this one role because it truly was his best performance.\n\nThe story is a hard one to swallow. Now I don't say that because it is far-fetched, but because the events are downright tragic at times. However the slow fade of Tevye being forced to prioritize love over his traditions is brilliantly told. You start to feel the struggle right along with him, and sadly it comes both from inside his family and from outside. In fact the only reason I don't rate this movie much higher is that the second half is tough for me to watch. While I know this is closer to reality, I just prefer something a little more uplifting (especially when I watch musicals.) However, personal preference aside, Fiddler on the Roof is a brilliant musical that everyone should see at least once.",

Lavish, bright cinematography and intricate sets with an eye for detail, a fantastic score with skillfully performed musical numbers, and realistic historical context with that script make for AAA production value.\nThe direction seems synchronized with just about everything else. It's all dovetailed with an enchanted sense of fun, delightfully and humorously reflected, to counter with its deep, poignant layers later on.\n\nThis fiddler loses a little bit of his grip because things get a little too haywire. Frankly, it's overlong, overdone, overrated, and a little overkill. But that's alright, though it does get somewhat formulaic. Not everything's tied up neatly, and it is trying on some people's patience. Some laughable\nand questionable moments only take the film's focus away. Even the film's most glaring flaws are easy to forgive though, making it mostly enjoyable.\n\nFor a musical, it's actually reached the zenith of its genre, along with \"Singin' in the Rain\". By those standards, that makes it pretty damn spectacular, compared to the stuff of today.",

He carries the film with such heart and humor. The subject of tradtion vs. change is examined and is it worth leaving one's tradtitions in order to give way to change? Jewison has always made social and political conscience films and this is no different.

And man, this most be the best musical I've seen. The wonderful love stories, the lovely term called tradition and the lovable characters makes this a movie I want to see multiple times. And let's face it, it's Topol who make this movie with his lovable character who always bring a smile on my face every time I think of him.\n\nFiddler on the Roof follows Tevye the milkman who lives in the jewish village named Anatevka in the early 20th century, in tsar russia at a time where antisemitism was growing stronger in Europe. A town bound by jewish traditions. We follow Tevye's daily troubles with his job and his total of six daughter who seems to care less about tradition than their parents, in sense of actually choosing the man whom they chose to be their husbands. When it's actually up to their father to decides. His family is poor, and hopes one day he become rich. His dreams are very good explained in the song \"If I Where A Rich Man\" with is a classic. But it's seems to be difficult for all of Anateyka's jewish inhabitants, when the Tsar sends out other to chase the jews out.\n\nFiddler on the Roof is for me probable the best musical ever made. The songs are just so well written, playful, passioned and funny. And of corse Topol deliverers his life performance, a performance that he have played on stage over 2000 times. Topol is a category for himself: I have just fallen in love with his jolly charismatic characters, not only in this film, but also any wear else. He's like Santa Clause, it's impossible to don't sit on his lap. There's only one Topol, and it's impossible to find, or even image another actor playing Teyve then Topol. I just love to shim with him all day, as I sing along.\n\nI could go all day, talking about how great Chaim Topol is, but I have to give some of the other actors some credits, both leading and supporting. Some of them jewish stereotypes. For instance, we have Yente, the matchmaker, we have Reb Nachum the Beggar. But seriously, we have other great leading performances like Norma Crane as Tevye's wife Golde, and also Leonard Frey who does a wonderful supporting performance as Motel, Tevye's son-in-law a tailor that doesn't seems like the ideal husband, because of his clumsiness, and lack of courage and masculinity. But it's certainly a delight when he sings. To keep it short, there's a character for every one. A big thumbs up from me.",

ACTOR and harvested 3 of them (music score, sound and cinematography).\r\n\r\nRunning time is over 180 minutes, I exerted myself quite hard to finish the film. Being an adaption of a success musical, the film version holds steady the same axiom \"Music is the cure!\". The melodies and riffs have a dominating impact so that the shallowness of the corny script (three marriages, specifically encountering money, politics and religion obstacles) should not hinder the sonic amalgam. \r\n\r\nI'm rather a peculiar person, as usually, musical has never been my cup of tea, let alone a prolonged one, despite of the fact that I'm a true contemporary music aficionado. The only fun I can acquire is from Topol's \"If I Were a Rich Man\", which I just realized is the catchy refrain of Gwen Stefani's hit single \"Rich Girl\". \r\n\r\nMaybe after 40 years, the didactical preaching through music has been outdated for my generation, also in a utopian world, Jewish or not is not an issue anymore (the same thing suitable for genders, religions, colors or sex orientations), so bearing the label of a nihilist, I find that John Williams soul-freeing score are much more tempting than Jerry Bock's oldies soundtrack. Anyway, one thing I can not deny is Topol's strenuous but fabulous performance (personally Paul Mann's Lazar wolf is my pick), which will never become bleached through all these years.",

While watching this film, it is clear to see that Norman Jewison has taken special care in the production of the film. Visually, this film is beautiful seeing the country side and showing how it changes from a poor village to an overworked piece of land that is barely holding on. The story for this film is, sadly, one of the weakest parts. One thing that a lot of people hate is repetition. This is a film that repeats itself quite a bit. The basic formula is this: Daughter gets married, Father is upset, he gives in. Now, one of the redeeming parts of this overworked plot is that it continues to work every time. Acting wise, the only person worth mentioning is Topol as Tevye. He is seriously the only actor that develops his character, and actually makes it worthwhile and good. The rest of the cast is mostly (and sadly) one dimensional and I personally do not care for that. They introduce some good characters that I would have loved to see changed and developed, but the acting of Topol makes up for them all (thankfully). Now, the score is the complete highlight of this film and what makes this film worth the watch. There are few films that treat the subject of Judaism with respect and this is one of those films that does. The music, the set props, all capture the beauty of this heavily abused and neglected and tortured religion, and finally there is a film that gives dignity. So, overall, I say see this film if you love the original stage play, like the works of Norman Jewison, or like good musicals. But if you are expecting a deep, philosophical story line, then you are looking in the wrong place. Now, why am I recommending this story? Simple: It does what it does and what it does it does well.",

Made in 1971, its 2001 DVD treatment left a lot to be desired.  At last, a Blu-ray edition comes out this week.  But the quality of that transfer still remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe musical works better on stage than it does as a motion picture.  Jewison's version incorporates a lot from the stage play but certain elements that work on stage do not necessarily bode well on film.  By using a lot of the material from the stage production, the film does get bogged down and has some pacing issues.  It does not warrant its 3-hour running time.\r\n\r\nJewison also uses a lot of close-up shots of the actors to show dramatic tension but in the process, these posed shots feels forced and staged rather than a natural act of a true emotion.  Still, the film manages to deliver where it counts.  The renditions of \"Tradition\", \"If I Were A Rich Man\" and the tavern dance sequence are all nicely done.\r\n\r\nIn the end, there is a certain lack of energy and imagination in Jewison's \"Fiddler\".  Except for the set decoration and costume designs, he really does not bring anything else new.  The film is very pedestrian.  For a story in which a lot of it takes place outdoors, its landscape shots and cinematography also does not shine.\r\n\r\nAs the film will not be remade anytime soon, it is best to catch \"Fiddler On The Roof\" live.  Its \"classic\" status will and shall remain attached to its stage version with this film adaptation a few notches below it.",

            "content": "I recently watched Fiddler on the Roof and although it does have a very important message to the Jewish people I also found it highly entertaining. In the story a father tries to hold his family to tradition until a traveling teacher comes along and causes a stir within the political and familial doctrines. He shows an old world man that he doesn't have to settle for the hand he is dealt and that he should allow his children the right to choose a different way other than the old ways. The lesson of life and love surviving amidst chaos plays a large role in this musical starring Topol who also starred in the Broadway version.\nTeyve is stuck in the time when a matchmaker chose who would wed based on the benefits to the families involved. He is also taught that you do not go against the anti-Semitism movement because God is allowing these things to happen because the youngsters are forgetting their place and the teachings.\nI really like this movie because although light hearted in some instances the terrible plight of the Jewish is still displayed. The unfairness of having important celebrations and their homes destroyed based on hate and ignorance is clearly portrayed in a manner that even a non-Jew may understand. The movie for me is truly about perseverance and striving to live life to the fullest because you may not always have that freedom based on the biases of others. The story caused Teyve to rethink his stand on the things he had been taught to believe because he watched as the lives around him were torn apart by people who hated him simply because of his religion. A person's action should dictate haw they are perceived the systematic annihilation of the Jewish people in Russia, Germany, Poland and other areas of Europe was an atrocity that is still being perpetrated on others as well as Jews.",

It's set in the Orthodox Jewish section of the tiny Russian ghetto town called Anatevka in the early 1900s. \n\nThis film is a bit overlong, and a little boring here and there, but aside from that, it is wonderful. It works better as a stage production, but it's still fine as a film. For the longest time, everything I knew about Jewish culture came from this film. It's portrayal of the Jewish people and culture (specifically Russian Jews) is quite accurate by many accounts, but a little laughable and stereotypical if taken out of context. \n\nI really like this movie, and it is one of my favorite musicals, but this isn't something I can bring myself to watch very often. It's a good story, but man, it's so depressing. I guess in the long run the story has a happier ending, but if you discount that, it's got a very bittersweet conclusion that seems to further reinforce the idea that Jews have such a miserable and downbeat history. \n\nThe acting is mostly pretty great. Some are better than others, though. It was controversial to cast him, but Topol makes for a great Tevye. It would have been awesome had they gotten Zero Mostel to reprise the role though.  The music is basically the star of the show, and it's essentially flawless..unless you don't like musicals. If that's the case though, then you have no business watching this.  I also really love the sets, costumes, and the camera work. The attention to detail is fantastic, and things just look gorgeous. \n\nI'll conclude this review with an interesting story: my dad, good Roman Catholic man that he is, enjoys this story so much that he tried to persuade my mom to name me Lazar Wolf instead of the name I ended up with. That's awesome.",

But as I see it this film is universal in its showing of whay it means to live and be human: family, beliefs, neighbours, love, joy, struggles, prejudice, and much more -- and of course *Tradition*.  And in that it moved me greatly.  \n\nThe film was beautifully shot, and I loved the long shots in particular where Tevye was pondering change and tradition in his dealings with family issues.  The songs were wonderful, and while Tevye takes centre stage, the others involved all bring delightfully real characters to the screen, Tevye's wife Golde [Norma Crane] in particular.\n\nA film that was for me uncomfortable to watch when you see man's prejudice and hatred of difference, but at the same time a film that left me with hope.

Tevye has an avaricious side to him (If I were a Rich Man) and a trouble-starting side (Take your diseased chickens....), which is trumped by his good-nature and likeability.  The film must conclude on a sad note, as anyone who knows the history of Jews in Tsarist Russia knows it must, but there is a personal triumph of sorts that makes the ending palatable.

            "content": "Fiddler on the Roof is based on the musical of the same name, which is based on Tevye the Milkman, a collection of short stories written by Yiddish author Sholem Aleichem. First of all, I haven't read the stories or seen the musical, so I definitely can't make comparisons.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the musical is a gem. The songs are great and the score is fantastic. The score was actually orchestrated wonderfully by John Williams, who is responsible for writing some of the most famous film-tunes that we all know like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter and Jaws. As much as I think Williams writes great tunes, one of the problems I have with his scores as that these signature tunes play ALL THE TIME in the films they're from. Every time Darth Vader is on the screen in Star Wars, the Darth Vader music plays and on top of that, you hear the theme all the time. The same went for Philosopher's Stone (NOT SORCERER'S STONE FOR GOD'S SAKE), where Hedwig's theme plays all the time. This wasn't the case in Fiddler on the Roof. Williams actually had some variety when he fused the traditional Jewish melodies with classical music.\r\n\r\nThe songs in the movie were also wonderful. Although I think Lazar Wolf's song went on for a bit too long and was a bit irrelevant to the plot (especially since Lazar doesn't marry Tzeitel), the rest of the songs worked perfectly in the context of the film. Topol had a wonderful voice and as for Norma Crane, it's good to see an alto in a lead female role!\r\n\r\nFor me, the thing that really stood out about the film was the characters, especially Tevye. I love Tevye. He's a poor Orthodox Jew who may be old-fashioned and extremely traditional, but overall he means well and cares about his family so much. He's just so good-natured and likeable. Usually I can't stand traditionalists! Golde was a very strong character too and each of the three main daughters were really interesting. \r\n\r\nTzeitel is interesting because she's willing to rebel against the unfair traditions of the day and goes out for what she wants, whether people approve of it or not. Hodel is interesting because she starts out as a girl who's waiting for her prince to rescue her; an anti-feminist. But then she realises that what she really wants is to dedicate her life to the Russian Revolution (which unfortunately didn't end well). Chava is interesting because she's willing to do everything she can to get what she wants, even if it means having to leave her family.\r\n\r\nIf I had to pick a fault with this movie, it would mainly be the length. Although I didn't have a problem with it, most people won't likely want to watch a movie that almost goes for three hours, despite the fact that it's based on a stage musical. \r\n\r\nThe other fault is that although I really liked the scenes they showed portraying the persecution of the Jews, I think they could've pushed it a little further, maybe even killing off one of the characters. I'm not saying it should've been violent like Schindler's List, but I think if they had shown a bit more violence, it would've given the musical a new level of depth and showed how Anti-Semitism is wrong. To be clear though, these faults are only tiny and can be forgiven. They're only things that if done differently, the movie would've been extra-extra awesome.\r\n\r\nI say for anyone who loves musicals, Jewish culture or likes history in general, they should definitely give it a watch. It's accurate, it's fun and it's good natured. In general, this is truly a wonderful movie.",

Yeah, it is long, three hours approximately, but there are so many things that compensate. Norman Jewison's direction is very good, and the film is stylishly filmed, with some nice cinematography and there are nice scenery and costumes. The choreography is great, energetic in parts and graceful in others. Next, the music is outstanding. The incidental music largely reminiscent of Russian folk music is a real treat, but the songs are outstanding. The beautiful \"Sunrise, Sunset\", the fun \"Tradition\", the idealistic \"Match Maker\" and the energetic \"If I Were A Rich Man\", all amazing. Also, Topol, what an absolutely brilliant performance. He put body and soul into Tevye, successfully mixing humour, wisdom and poignancy and the result is one of the most memorable performances in any musical to grace our screens. All the other performances are wonderful, I liked it all five daughters had distinct personalities, and Norma Crane is fantastic as the mother. The story is both tight and poignant, about a milkman of Jewish values, who wishes his five daughters to marry. In conclusion, wonderful and definitely memorable. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It holds up on my top list of fav classic old movies ( like Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, Dr. Zhivaho....) and I dislike musicals!! It was entertaining while it taught me a bit of Jewish tradition mixed with history. When movies first started I had my doubts of thinking this will be a bore, I am not interested in Jewish traditions and don\u2019t like too much singing. I hated Le Mis the movie, but gave this one a chance.It was perfect, the acting, Dancing, singing and choreography was perfect , someone mentioned choreography of the dance scenes were weak, I disagree.....we don\u2019t need these villagers dancing with perfect choreography and ballet or professional dance moves, the movie shows them singing and dancing like I would with my friends and sister.Tevye is just brilliant, the signings , his voice, the acting...just fantastic. I watched the whole thing and didn\u2019t once look at what time it was as the movie is 3 hours long. A must see, I will watch it again just to enjoy this magnificent movie.",
