            "content": "For me this is that movie that you love when you're young but as you get older you see the dark side to it.I mean...it's not exactly Masha and the Bear even on a superficial level but you know what I mean.As an action movie, this is just timeless. It has a gentle, yet uncompromising tone that immediately puts you in the mindset that you are in an unforgiving, violent world. It's clearly going for the X rating. It's not about elegance, it's just about being honest.There's something folkloric in this tale of hunter and hunted where it's hard to tell who is the more brutal. That was indeed meant to be the gimmick: \"two killers on the loose, one carries a badge\".It's a vivid movie about sadism and unapologetic brutality. Where there is only kill or let others get killed. Harry is a delicious character and Eastwood's cool portrayal, always seeming to be one jolt away from going nuts is captivating.But in recent years I've had new feelings. Harry seems to personify that kind of cop who hates the 4th amendment, who sees themselves as the only barrier between the innocent and monsters and is devoted to protecting without a thought for who will protect the public from him. It's that counter-counter-cultural thinking wear one wants more power to law enforcement not less. I know the title suggests that these are Harry's negative traits but when watching, these are why we fall in love with him as a character. It's kind of a double bluff. Especially when Harry's violation of protocol is seemingly respesented as necessary.Scorpio is amazing. He is played with maniacal relish that complements the stony Harry like how the Joker does for batman. But I would say he's scarier. We don't get the comic fantasy as a barrier.I might be overthinking this movie but it is a fascinating rumination on grey morality and how it's not always easy to tell who to root for. even when you think you've realised that the official heroes aren't always good.it's a difficult movie to interalize and ultimately, that's why it's brilliant.There's never been a movie quite like it.",

            "content": "This film has it all, amazing soundtrack, amazing cinematography in the amazing San Francisco area, terrific cast of actors who played believable in their roles. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, story, cinematography. It is one of my personal favorite action movies of all time.Dirty Harry (1971) is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece and one of his best movies including the best memorable character! The movie that started it all! It is the best action thriller film from Clint Eastwood and director Don Siegel! Clint at his asskicking best! It is my favorite best film from Clint Eastwood and the first best one in the series. Even tough he did not directed this film he gave us one if his best performances ever! I love all Dirty Harry movies but this one is a classic and the best in the series. It has action suspense from end till beginning. A movie that will make anyone's day, if you feel lucky punk. I have seen the first one 20 times and will argue that it's the best with no question, but it is somewhat a matter of opinion :)\"I know what your thinking. Did he fire six shots or just five? We'll Do I feel lucky? We'll do ya punk?\" Harry Callahan's best quotes. This is one classic Clint Eastwood film. He funnels traits of himself into \"Dirty\" Harry: no nonsense, dry humor, some charm and a good logical mind. Andrew Robinson had trouble getting work for a while after this movie because he did such a great job as Scorpio. Getting typecast as a psychopath kind of limits your casting options. Andrew Robinson also played in my favorite action Stallone flick Cobra (1986) and horror flick Hellraiser (1987). He did a great performance ever as a psychotic killer Scorpio. Reni Santoni was also cast in this movie as Harry's partner Homicide Inspector Chico Gonzalez. He also started 15 years later in my action flick Cobra (1986) alongside Andrew Robinson! I can say both of the actors did a fine job playing in bot cop flicks. First one is the best. But, a little bit of background is due. Academy Award-winner Clint Eastwood (\"Unforgiven,\" \"Million Dollar Baby\") stars as \"Dirty Harry\" Callahan in this riveting action film that spawned several blockbuster sequels. In this original, Detective Harry Callahan is determined to bring in psychotic killer Robinson, even if he's determined to break some of the rules. Brilliantly filmed for maximum impact. Recently selected by the prestigious American Film Institute as one of the 400 greatest American films of all time and added \"Dirty Harry\" as part of the 50 Greatest Heroes of all time.Dirty Harry is a 1971 American action thriller film produced and directed by Don Siegel, the first in the Dirty Harry series. The basic plot is about catching a serial killer who was based on a Zodiac Killer. This is one of best movies ever. The story is good, acting is brilliant and effects and action scenes are epic. Watch this movie now!!!! Great films stick inside your head,and this one is a brain limpet! The cinematography and evocation of the San Francisco setting are hauntingly memorable,the dialogue taut and sparse and Schifrin's score is still super cool.Don Siegel and Clint must have studied the European stylists because I read Dirty Harry as the finest amalgam of US Noir and 60's new wave. I find echos of Antonioni and Melville in the tight,clean mis en scene and impeccable action sequences honed by Siegel's long Hollywood pedigree. superb. This movie is 10 out of 10.",

            "review_title": "One of \"The\" films of the 1970s",
            "content": "Don Siegel's \"Dirty Harry\" was arguably the start of the serial killer/cop genre inherent in so many mainstream American movies released today. Setting the stage for countless rip-offs and sequels, \"Dirty Harry\" was one of the true first of its kind--not only in regards to its genre influence but also in terms of its content. (Full frontal nudity, heavy vigilante-style violence and strong language.) It is, in fact, one of the quintessential 1970s films--capturing the very essence of the typical gritty '70s film style we're all familiar with. If \"Midnight Cowboy\" began the trend, \"Dirty Harry\" extends it.Clint Eastwood delivers one of his finest performances as the titular \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan. He's got just the right amount of cocky cynacism and inset sense of self-justice and importance to make the character realistic and likable, despite his flaws.The plot almost seems routine now, but back in '71 it was controversial stuff: Harry is a tough cop trying to track down a mad serial killer in San Francisco, who is murdering victims in an effort to receive ransom money. When he kidnaps a young girl, Harry makes it his mission to disobey direct orders and take on the killer by himself.It's easy to point at this now and say, \"I've seen this already.\" In many cases film classics can only be graded well for nostalgic purposes, because their imitators have improved upon the original material.Not here. The original really does still remain (one of) the best.Siegel would later follow up \"Dirty Harry\" with another examination of criminals and cops, and would also team up again with Clint Eastwood. This is probably his best film, which is saying a lot. Its reputation precedes it, but in this case, the strength of the film itself really is deserving of its popularity. The final speech is awesome stuff.",

The cinematography is fine and the locations and scenery are quite striking. Lalo Schifrin's music sets the atmosphere very well too, while the story is taut, the script is quotable and cleverly written, Don Siegel's direction is superb and the violence is shocking and daring. The acting is also great, in his more complex roles Clint Eastwood was born for the role of Dirty Harry, and all the supporting roles are very well played. All in all, brilliant and one of the crime thrillers there is. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "The Conflict of Two Rights",
            "content": "The late sixties and seventies saw the growth of the \"tough cop\" thriller. In earlier crime thrillers (\"White Heat\", from the late forties, is a good example) the police had generally been portrayed as honourable and incorruptible men who did everything by the book. The new breed of heroes were different. They were not only tough but also morally ambiguous, capable of bending and even breaking the rules when they thought it was necessary.Before making \"Dirty Harry\", Clint Eastwood had acted in another film of this type, \"Coogan's Bluff\". Both films had the same director, Don Siegel. \"Coogan's Bluff, however, is a lightweight film, with a rather annoying hero who likes to cut corners because he cannot be bothered to go through the proper channels. My sympathies are with Lee J. Cobb's old-school New York cop, irritated beyond measure by Coogan's impatience and cowboy brashness.In \"Dirty Harry\" much more important matters are at stake. A serial killer calling himself \"Scorpio\" is terrorising San Francisco by carrying out killings at random. Some of his victims seem to have been chosen on the basis of religious or racial bigotry, but Scorpio's main motive is blackmail; he will stop killing if the city authorities pay him $100,000. When this blackmail fails, Scorpio kidnaps a young girl, buries her underground with a limited supply of oxygen and announces that he will let her die if his demands are not met. Reluctantly, the authorities agree to hand over the money.The police officer on the case is Inspector Harry Callahan, nicknamed \"Dirty Harry\", partly because of his uncompromising methods and partly because he gets the jobs other officers don't want. Disgusted by the willingness of the authorities to meet Scorpio's demands, Harry tracks down the main suspect, arrests him after shooting him in the leg, finds the murder weapon and forces him to reveal the girl's whereabouts (unfortunately too late to save her life). Although there can be no doubt of the man's guilt, the city's Mayor and District Attorney order his release because the evidence against him is inadmissible; Harry had no warrant to search his premises and the confession obtained by strong-arm methods would not be admissible in Court. Scorpio's narrow escape does not, however, persuade him that crime does not pay, and soon afterwards he kidnaps and holds hostage a busload of schoolchildren. Only Harry can save them\u0085\u0085 In some ways Harry is an unsympathetic character. He is cool to the point of coldness and always has an air of menace about him, particularly during the famous \"Do you feel lucky?\" speech. Some of his dialogue suggests that he is racially prejudiced himself. Clint Eastwood made the role so much his own that it is strange to think he was only fourth choice after Frank Sinatra, John Wayne and Paul Newman. It is doubtful whether any of those actors could have played the part so well. Sinatra might have made him too unsympathetic. Newman could have conveyed his coolness but might not have had the same underlying menace. Wayne (as he was to prove in \"Brannigan\" a few years later) was definitely too old for a role of this type.This film has always been controversial, with critics divided along ideological lines. (The film-makers seem to have intended a deliberate juxtaposition of Harry's values with those of the city of San Francisco which, during the hippie era, was becoming known as America's most liberal city). Liberals such as Roger Ebert have loathed Harry, seeing him as a man who thinks himself above the law, even a fascist. They note that his treatment of Scorpio violates (as the DA points out) at least three, and possibly four, constitutional amendments. (Such liberal critics are divided as to whether the film condemns or condones Harry's methods). Conservatives, however, see him as a hero, a man who will defend the public from crime while his superiors seem more concerned to defend the criminals. They point out that the seventies liberals who were so quick to condemn Harry for acting in breach of the constitution did not apply the same literal-minded legalism to, say, those who were resisting the (constitutionally permissible) Vietnam draft or to civil rights protesters who were engaged in civil disobedience against (constitutionally tolerated) racism in the Southern states.\"Dirty Harry\" is much more than a cop thriller; it is a film that asks some important questions. It may seem odd to compare a tough cop with draft resisters or with civil rights campaigners, but Harry faces a moral choice similar to that confronting those two groups of people. In each case the central question is \"If there is a conflict between the two, should one obey the law of the land or should one obey one's own conscience\". This is a question to which there is often no easy answer and is particularly acute for Harry because, as a police officer, he is duty-bound to uphold the law. The law states that he should not carry out a search without a warrant and that he should not use force to obtain a confession from Scorpio. His conscience tells him that he must do both these things to save an innocent life.The German dramatist Friedrich Hebbel once remarked that tragedy does not arise out of the conflict of right and wrong. It arises out of the conflict of two rights. This is the situation which we see in this film, which means that both the liberal and conservative viewpoints quoted above are right- and both are wrong. The law is right to impose limits on police powers, in order to protect the citizen from abuse of those powers by corrupt or over-zealous officers. And Harry is right to go beyond those limits in an effort to save a life. 8/10",

He didn't even have to utter a line: he just looked deranged! Great casting.Looking back, the one thing I really appreciate about this film as opposed to the rest of them in this series was the absence of Harry's annoying superiors constantly on his case. He actually got support from his bosses in this movie.The film as a big hit because people were already tired of all the liberal preaching of the 1960s in which we were supposed to feel sympathy for the criminal instead of the victim. This series was on the side of the cops, not the crooks, which is probably why the sick film critics never liked Dirty Harry.This is one solid crime story with no boring spots and no sappy sub-plots with romances, either.

Then he demands ransom of US$ 100,000.00 to the Major (John Vernon), otherwise he would kill a black man and a priest. Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) a.k.a. Dirty Harry, investigates the case with his partner, the rookie Inspector Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni).When the serial-killer kills his victims and abducts a teenager, he demands US$ 200,000.00 and Harry is assigned to deliver the bag to the criminal. Inspectors Callahan and Gonzalez are wounded by Scorpio, but Callahan stabs Scorpio on the leg. The killer goes to the emergency of the hospital and Callahan tracks him down and tortures him to find where the teenager is imprisoned. However, the Dist. Atty. William T. Rothko (Josef Sommer) advises Callahan that the evidences would not be accepted in court and Charles \"Scorpio\"' Davis is released. Callahan chases the deranged criminal and becomes his implacable persecutor. The last time I saw \"Dirty Harry\" was on 29 December 1999 and today I have decided to see this excellent 1971 film by Don Siegel again. It is great to see that this film has not aged after forty years.\"Dirty Harry\" was one of my favorite heroes, bringing real justice and breaking the bureaucratic rules. I believe that a great part of honest citizen feels powerless with the unfair justice system in Western countries that usually does not punish those who deserve, and characters like Dirty Harry are worshiped due to their attitude. \"Dirty Harry\" is the first out of five films of this character played by Clint Eastwood. I intend to see all of them again to recall how Hollywood knew how to make good films in a near past. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Perseguidor Implac\u00e1vel\" (\"Implacable Persecutor\")",

            "content": "\"Dirty Harry\" is an incredible action film, one of the finest ever made and certainly an *extremely* influential one, spawning legions of imitative cop flicks made in the subsequent 43 years. It gave Clint Eastwood a contemporary-set star vehicle to rival the Westerns he'd headlined in the 1960s, and gave us an iconic hero character with whom we could identify: a man who's weary of a \"justice\" system that shows too much sympathy to lowlife bad guys who don't merit that sort of thing.Eastwoods' \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan (so nicknamed because he gets stuck with \"dirty\" jobs that nobody else wants to do) is a police detective with a wicked .44 Magnum (that will blow your head *clean* off) and a disgust at having to deal with weak superiors and criminal slime. Harry picks up the trail of a psychotic rooftop sniper, \"Scorpio\" (Andrew Robinson, in one hell of a breakthrough film performance), and is willing to do anything necessary - the rulebook be damned - to get his man.Highlighted by Lalo Schifrins' groovy jazz score, impressive aerial photography, and exemplary location work (director Don Siegel and company make the city of San Francisco just as much a character here as any of the human players), \"Dirty Harry\" is wonderfully put together, and features a solid action climax involving a bus. Harry's dialogue (the screenplay is credited to Harry Julian Fink, Rita M. Fink, and Dean Riesner) is memorable and quotable; his \"do I feel lucky\" speech is now cinema legend.The film is very well directed by Siegel and features a strong supporting cast including Harry Guardino, Reni Santoni, John Vernon, John Larch, John Mitchum, and Josef Sommer; small uncredited roles are played by the likes of Max Gail, Richard Lawson, and Albert Popwell; Popwell, as buffs well know, became a recurring actor in the \"Dirty Harry\" series.Overall, this is absolutely essential viewing for action fans of all ages.10 out of 10.",

            "content": "In quoting these famous lines: \"A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do!\" and \"Go ahead, make my day!\". They meant something for Clint Eastwood, turning from cowboy to hit man with a surge of raging anger and ambition. The mountain terrains became an urban metropolis, thus putting the guy off the saddle and into the bloody streets of San Francisco. Which makes DIRTY HARRY an incredible classic not to be missed, as well as Eastwood's shift to the action genre where society is run by evil. Its continuous impact of the events take place with a tight grip and a smooth pace. This remains to be one of the most entertaining experiences in classic movie history. All it takes is a cop over the edge and \"The Most Powerful Handgun In The World\".Violence was the key factor of DIRTY HARRY, and continues to be violent even today. We've never come to see staggering sights of brutalities before, but it was made possible to heighten the overall realism of a dark San Francisco infested with crime. Another was the quality of Clint Eastwood's character as \"Harry Callahan\", which was obviously a breakthrough for him at the time. He is best described as a smart-talking cop who hated criminals and broken the laws in serving time for the police. A very unique character he was, for going by his own personal business and taking the job \"dirty\". The best acheivement goes for the cinematography. It sure doesn't look pretty, but the effectiveness of the dark renders this haunting where no place is safe enough to run or hide. The real winner is Don Siegel, for presenting the perfect atmosphere to shoot a picture that already had a premise driven by fear and anxiety, anger and tension. He sure hasn't done anything like this before, and possibly no movie had since then. Otherwise, we would have still been seeing these one-dollar Western shows in the afternoon!Watch DIRTY HARRY today and you can see how the styles of moviemaking has evolved slow and easy, but it still packs a powerful bullet or two. If you've seen this six times or only five, you knew how lucky Clint Eastwood got the perfect part for being an all-new action star. This is the one, and original cop movie. And remember, this is \"In Tribute To The Police Officers Of San Francisco Who Gave Their Lives In The Line Of Duty\"!",

            "content": "How radically different cinema history, and our collective consciousness, would have been if Frank Sinatra hadn't injured his hand before shooting started on \"Dirty Harry\".  Sinatra was due to play Harry, but had to withdraw, clearing the way for Clint.  Given Sinatra's unique brand of self-loathing, Harry would have been an uglier personality than Clint made him.  As it is, Lieutenant Callaghan is an ornery anti-liberal cuss of a guy, but he is straight and likeable.  Arguably, it was this characterisation which made Eastwood a megastar.San Francisco in 1971 was ready for stardom itself.  The West Coast love-in scene and the gay 'boom', together with McQueen's \"Bullitt\", raised awareness of San Francisco as an exciting liberal city with a photogenic skyline.  The film's funky score by Lalo Schifrin is perfectly-judged, and spawned numerous imitators.The central narrative concerns a lone nut who is trying to hold the city to ransom.  He starts by murdering citizens to extort money from the mayor, then progresses to kidnapping children.  This plays cleverly on the inchoate anxieties of Middle America, where law-abiding people were puzzled and alarmed at the 'crime wave' and the threat it posed to them and their families.  Crime in the decades before the Kennedy assassination had been compartmentalised by Hollywood.  Gangsters were bad, but they killed other gangsters.  Now the danger was unpredictable, irrational - and solitary. The lone madman was as likely to strike against me or you as against an institution.  Only a single-minded strong man, operating on the fringes of the rules, could combat this new terror.Harry is a paradox.  In one sense, he is an 'outlaw'.  He has little respect for formal authority (in the opening minutes, we see him being rude to the mayor) and he carries a strictly non-regulation monster of a gun. Harry is openly racist and mutinous.  And yet he is also deeply moral.  He conforms to an unarticulated ethical code that is anglosaxon American.  He protects the weak and confronts the wrongdoers, no matter how the odds are stacked against him.  Indeed, the cowardly bureaucrats who will never reward him or promote him are able to exploit his profound decency.  They send him on all the difficult, dirty jobs because they know that his sense of right and wrong won't allow him to walk away.Early in the film, the famous bank robbery scene occurs.  This has become so familiar that it hardly needs elaborating here, but to summarise, Harry foils an armed robbery using icy courage and grim humour - and his magnum handgun.  The special brand of Eastwood humour recurs throughout the story (eg, the suicide jumper and the gay called 'Alice').  White anglosaxon America is encouraged to laugh at the undergroups which supposedly threaten it.When the bad guy 'Scorpio' is cornered, he immediately starts bleating about his civil rights.  This is meant to arouse our fury, because we have seen him callously destroying the lives of others, and here he is exploiting the protection of the state.  To make matters worse, the state agrees with him.  We see the DA and a judge explaining to Harry why the cogent evidence against Scorpio is inadmissible.  Just exactly why the DA would call a meeting with a lowly policeman in order to explain department policy is far from clear, but the scene is  thematically necessary.  Scorpio is using the System against the decent, godfearing people who own it.  The liberal apparatus is skewed if it lets a killer walk away scot-free.There are some illogicalities about the plot.  Such an important event as the cash drop is left to two cops working alone, when in reality there would be a massive covert operation.  When Scorpio beats the rap, there is no public outcry or media storm, and he is allowed to get on with his anonymous existence virtually untroubled.However, this hardly matters since the main thrust of the story is the coming showdown between Harry and the bad guy.  As the climax approaches, Harry drops out of the police operation.  Scorpio is at his manic worst on the hi-jacked school bus, alienating us nicely and suppressing any liberal twitches we may still be feeling.  Then we see Harry, standing as upright and sturdy as the Statue Of Liberty ....",

I watched it streaming on Netflix and it was a very dark and muddy copy--and left a lot to be desired.Harry (Clint Eastwood) is a tough cop. He's good at his job but often gets on the wrong side of his superiors due to his propensity to leave a long trail of bodies in dispensing justice. And, throughout the film, he delivers--one amazing act of insane bravery after another. In this first installment, he's after a psycho serial killer who calls himself 'Scorpio'. Scorpio has begun killing random folks and is extorting money out of the city to make him stop. Considering that there are four sequels to this film, you can pretty safely assume that in the end, Harry will come out on top.\"Dirty Harry\" is a cop film from a new generation of gritty anti-hero cop films. While it's not among the first (the late 60s saw such films as \"Madigan\" and \"The Detective\"), it was certainly dirty in every sense. The film is raw--bloody, violent, peppered with spicy language and racial epithets as well as nudity. This is NOT a movie to show the kids and your mother! When the film was shown on TV for the first time, significant chunks were cut. Even compared to films today, this is a pretty rough film. On the other hand, you've gotta admit that it's great entertainment. The script is solid, the film (oddly) has an unusual sense of humor and the acting is excellent all around.By the way, although I really enjoyed this film, the best San Francisco cop film still, in my opinion, is \"Bullitt\". Seeing both as a double-feature would be fantastic. Also, in \"Dirty Harry\", I don't think the film needed the portion where Scorpio pays someone to beat him up--it didn't really add much to the film and wasn't really integrated well into the movie.",

It's a phrase we hear on Law and Order all the time. They too, come up with some exotic interpretations of the law for their shows.That's where the story line of Dirty Harry falls apart. But in terms of entertainment Dirty Harry is spot on. Clint Eastwood created his most iconic character in this film directed by Don Siegel.Eastwood is Inspector Harry Callahan, a cop from the old school who hadn't heard of Miranda and Escobedo and other such court decisions that give the perpetrators a few weapons of their own in the legal system. He's assigned to the Scorpio case. Scorpio is a psychotic and random killer who's been striking down innocent victims at random with a high powered rifle with telescopic sight. When he graduates to kidnapping and burying a victim alive and giving the city of San Francisco a set time to cough up a ransom, he's reaching a new low.A lot of people, mostly of the liberal persuasion, have a hard time grasping the concept of pure evil for its own sake. In Andy Robinson who's made a career as a successor to Lyle Bettger playing a lovely variety of psychos, as Scorpio he's come up with a career role. This is one unredeemable dude, he's the reason you have capital punishment.Playing the liberal types who frustrate Eastwood are John Vernon as the Mayor of San Francisco, District Attorney Josef Sommer, and Judge William Patterson. Caught in the middle are police chief John Larch and Eastwood's immediate supervisor Harry Guardino who spends the entire film being terribly harassed and getting it from both ends.Of course Eastwood has his own methods of dealing with hoodlums as well who wish to play his own chicken game and want to test their memories as to just how many shots were fired from the most powerful handgun in the world. The 357 magnum isn't standard police issue, but it's Clint's equalizer. Some punks feel luckier than others.Dirty Harry is not Clint Eastwood's best film, but it's certainly his most enduring character.",

In this character, Eastwood is the archetypal cop of the 1970s... He is unsociable, insensitive, silent without apparent reason, incapable equally of thought or of any human feeling, solving all problems with a blast from a revolver so heavy that it takes two hands to aim it... In fact, the reason why Clint Eastwood behaves so ruthlessly in \"Dirty Harry\" is carefully plotted at one point in the film: his wife was killed by a hit-and-run driver escaping from the scene of a crime, so he hates all baddies\u0085'Dirty Harry' supplanted suspense by action, tension by brutality, character by a bigger and better bullet...Eastwood is a plain-clothes policeman who puts his faith in his Colt Magnum.44 and his ability to use it... He is ready to shoot down a criminal as arrest him... Eastwood brought the rude justice of the lawless West to the regular laws of the modern city... Perhaps his behavior would have been less controversial if he had merely been a renegade cop who broke the rules when roused by anger, but in the cool neon light of his superior's office, he is evidently unrepentant about his behavior...Eastwood had played 'Dirty Harry' five times in the sequels 'Magnum Force', 'The Enforcer', 'Sudden Impact' and 'The Dead Pool.' Callahan is always in a situation where he has to be his own judge and jury... Harry always gets somebody who's very lethal... In the case of \"Dirty Harry\", it was a psychopathic killer... Callahan wants to get him off the streets so that nobody else becomes a victim... He is a man on the side of the public... He feels that the law is wrong and he should fight that or try to solve it... Harry is not a man who stands for violence... He is a man who can't understand society tolerating violence... Eastwood is reassuringly indestructible and in real situations he adopts the fantasy mastery of a traditional Western loner...

Cut to a rooftop sniper shooting a girl taking a swim in a swimming pool, cut to the coolest looking cop you have ever seen making his way to the rooftop scene, he stands and surveys the whole of the San Francisco bay area, this is, his area, and we know we are in for a very special film indeed.Dirty Harry is now something of an institution, the film that pushed the boundaries of cops Vs bad guys movies, some of the films dialogue became part of modern day speak, and the film that propelled Clint Eastwood into the stratosphere of super stardom. Often tagged as a fascist film, I think it's more a cynical look at the rights of criminals because Harry is everyone who has ever been a victim of crime, he will do what it takes to take down the criminals festering in society, you break the law and Harry will get you any way he can. Here Harry is on the trail of Scorpio, a ruthless sniper killing at random, Scorpio kidnaps a teenage girl and demands $200.000 from the city or she will die in the hole he has her buried in. Harry is just the man for the job of delivery boy and this sets the wheels in motion for what becomes a personal crusade for Harry to take Scorpio down at all costs.Director Don Siegel crafts a masterpiece here, creating a western within the big city landscape, the pace is energetic at times yet reeling itself in to provide genuine suspense when needed. Siegel should also be praised for sticking by Andy Robinson as Scorpio for it's an insanely great performance from him, but it might never had happened since Robinson was petrified of guns, but Siegel stood by him and coaxed him thru it. The result is a maniacal turn that scares and amuses in equal measure, witness his mad singing during a bus kidnap scene, you wont know whether to laugh or be afraid.Yet as good as Robinson is, he gives way to a seamless piece of magnificence from Eastwood as Harry Callahan, note perfect and enthusing the role with the right amount of dynamic cool and gusto, it's no surprise that the character became a cinematic legend after such a great acting performance. Finally I must mention the wonderful score from Lalo Schifrin, jazz/electro/beat combinations segue perfectly into each scene with maximum impact to cap off one of the finest films of the 70s, and if you don't believe me then you go argue with Harry. 9/10",

            "content": "This stylish 1970s critique of the U.S. justice system is well known as a crime action drama, and is widely regarded as one of many breakthrough films for Clint Eastwood. Eastwood plays the same sort of character he typically plays - a likable tough guy with a powerful sense of justice and ice for blood. This Eastwood, however, has lost his wife to a drunk driver, some of his partners to murderous criminals, and some aspect of his sanity to his job. He's an inspector in the San Francisco police force's Homicide Division. The film is highly regarded for Eastwood's charismatic performance, for the boldness of the Dirty Harry character, and for the several spaghetti-western quotes uttered by Eastwood. I have a slightly different take on this film. Dirty Harry was released in the same year as The French Connection - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067116/combined - a film partly based on real life detectives catching the feeling of police dealing with the hard realities of the drug trade in the big apple of the early 1970s. Dirty Harry - as cool as Eastwood's character may be - is a one-dimensional creature compared with Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle. Something about Harry Callahan's political incorrectness resonates in a disturbing way with people who have only examined police work and the justice system through their televisions. The reality of this aspect of modern life is far less interesting, dramatic, and straightforward. And the critique of \"American justice\" is at least as powerfully made in the French Connection as it is here. Furthermore, The French Connection was an extremely innovative film, while Dirty Harry was a fairly typical stylized police-fantasy. The only explanations for the on-going popularity of this film, then, are Eastwood's charisma and the sheer entertainment value of this gutsy, gritty, hardcore crime drama. Harry is on the trail of a serial killer played by the phenomenal character actor Andrew J. Robinson in his major film debut. Andy Robinson makes a great psycho, and, at times, appears so out-of-control (nicely contrasted with Eastwood's reptilian calm) that it is a wonder he didn't seriously injure himself during the shooting of the film. When Robinson abducts a young girl and buries her alive, extorting $200, 000 from the mayor's office, Harry uses some unconventional tactics to bring him to justice. This brings us slightly past the midpoint of the film, and just to the point where it accelerates into a first-rate action thriller. While I think Dirty Harry is a very good film, and worth seeing at least a couple of times, I do not necessarily agree with the general opinion concerning the film. It is disappointing to me that this film did not make Andy Robinson the star that it helped to make Clint Eastwood into - especially since the range of characters and emotions these two men have shown themselves capable of is so disparate (in favor of Mr. Robinson). It is also surprising to me to see that the obvious connection (dare I say plagiarisn) between this film and the French Connection has been glossed over by film history so completely. In the same light, it bothers me that this film is rated so highly as compared with the French Connection. And finally, I am pleased that Dirty Harry is still a film that action fans enjoy, because unlike most of what the action genre produces today, this is a film with a message, and a subtle and hauntingly memorable intelligence.",

I only heard it twice and both were well merited- the first is said to a caught bankrobber and it's spoken like it's right out of the script, direct. The second comes near the end when Harry finally has his culprit cornered, and all the rage and fury is revealed, which made me want to cheer even though I was watching it by myself.Dirty Harry is one of the best and indeed grittiest action films from the 70's, possibly from the 20th century, and it makes Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry into a star by making such an anti-hero witty and likeable, sort of in a sense like an avenging, cop version of McDowell's character in Clockwork Orange (both released in 1971). In this first installment of the \"Callahan\" movies, Harry is brought on the case of the zodiac killer (Andrew Robinson), and is given a new partner, which Harry can't stand, and as the events unfold he knows he has to get him. Robinson is perfectly cast as the killer, with his scene on the bus ranking as one of the more terrifying, visceral scenes in the movies. Very 70's, but it's hard-boiled status can't be denied for Clint buffs. A+",

            "content": "Don Siegel's highly polished .44 magnum-opus, with Clint Eastwood as the daddy (or should that be mutha?) of all maverick cops. Given an A-picture budget by Warners, Siegel delivered a tremendously taut thriller, as provocatively amoral as anything he had done in his 20-year career of expert B-pics like The Killers.Dirty Harry also gave Eastwood a definitive Hollywood identity after leaving spaghetti westerns behind. It may lack the humour of Siegel and Eastwood's first collaboration, Coogan's Bluff, but it packs a much more uneasy political punch.Inspector Harry Callaghan is the taciturn, laconic spokesman of Nixon's Silent Majority, elevated to iconic status. His dialogue with criminals is delivered behind the barrel of a devastatingly phallic Magnum hand-gun. \"Feel lucky, punk?\" he taunts one wounded miscreant in a famous line he repeats at the end of the film.There's just enough moral ambiguity about Harry in this film to escape it being an endorsement of vigilantism \u0096 but if it poses resonating questions about how a liberal society can be held hostage by those outside the law, it also contrives a worryingly two-dimensional picture of psycho-killer Scorpio (Andy Robinson) - and of Harry, himself \u0096 with which to frame those questions.Made by the veteran director in the same year as Hollywood-new wave young gun William Friedkin shot The French Connection, it's just as coolly authoritative and exciting. Siegel uses Bruce Surtees' always serviceable photography of San Francisco locations with flair (years before, he had shot the low-budget but excellent The Line-Up there). The swooping helicopter shot out of the baseball stadium, as if to rush the audience away (either as witnesses or as voyeurs) as Eastwood presses his foot on Scorpio's wounded leg, shows Siegel's smooth mastery of the medium.Siegel made the insouciant Charley Varrick with Walter Matthau next, after which his career went into slow decline.",

This distinctive, gritty thriller was made at the cusp of the '70s, when everything was getting darker and more violent, and this is no exception. In essence, it sees Clint Eastwood tackling a sadistic psychopath who spends half his time as a sniper and the other half abducting and raping children. Yes, it's unpleasant subject matter all right, but with sure hand director Don Siegel at the helm and Eastwood in one of his most iconic roles in front of the camera, it's never less than entertaining.Really, this film belongs to Eastwood. It's his most famous role and he plays it laconic like nobody else can. He's an outsider, an old-fashioned guy in a modern world, and he seems just to have stepped out of the wild west into a time and place he doesn't belong. Full of witty put-downs and smart dialogue, Eastwood owns this movie and it feels lacking whenever he isn't around, which is fine because he's on screen for 95% of the time.Opposing Eastwood is Andrew Robinson in a breakthrough performance as one of cinema's most chilling psychopaths \u2013 he certainly gives Anthony Perkins a run for his money! Robinson is scarily brilliant as the anything-goes killer who keeps evading justice until the thrilling climax in which he and Eastwood finally face off. Along the way, they have plenty of run-ins, utilising great choreography. There's a show-off in an deserted football stadium which screams 'epic' and a wonderful action sequence with Eastwood atop a hijacked bus at the climax which works precisely because the star isn't afraid to do all his own stunts. Add in the famous bank robbery sequence \u2013 ending with Eastwood's \"lucky\" speech \u2013 and a supporting cast of tough guy actors fitting their roles like a glove and you have one very famous, enjoyable classic.",

            "content": "Maverick San Francisco police detective Harry Callahan (superbly played with magnetic self-assurance by Clint Eastwood) infuriates his uptight superiors by bending the rules in order to nab vicious crazed sniper Scorpio (a genuinely creepy and chilling portrayal by Andy Robinson). Director Don Siegel, working from a tough and hard-hitting script by Harry Julian Fink and R.M. Fink, relates the gripping story with exceptionally tight and precise narrative economy, builds a considerable amount of gut-wrenching tension (the climax with Scorpio abducting a bus full of kids is especially strong and nerve-wracking), and stages the rousing action set pieces with tremendous expertise. Siegel deserves additional props for the movie's unflinchingly gritty tone: The realistic brutal violence is truly harsh and unpleasant while Scorpio's victims include a little black boy and a fourteen-year-old girl. Of course, it's Eastwood's star-making turn as supremely cool and poised anti-hero supreme Harry that makes this film a remarkably fierce and explosive classic of the crime police genre: sardonic, laid-back, resolute in his firm sense of hardboiled justice, constantly needled and ridiculed by his disapproving by-the-book fellow law enforcers, disillusioned with bureaucratic red tape, and rendered rootless and stoical by the tragic death of his wife, Harry sure is a fascinatingly rugged and formidable iconoclastic enforcer of the law who may not follow correct procedure, but certainly gets the job done just the same in his own decidedly unorthodox way. Moreover, this film makes a powerful and provocative central statement about how the conventional law and order system quite simply doesn't work because it leans too much in favor of criminals (Scorpio gets off on a technicality after Harry busts him). This picture warrants extra praise for its strong feeling of urban blight, with Bruce Surtees' stark cinematography vividly depicting an eerie, corrupt uninviting nocturnal 'Frisco that's rife with decay and danger. Lalo Schifrin's funky'n'jazzy score hits the groovy spot. While Eastwood definitely holds the whole movie together by the strength of his substantial charisma alone, he nonetheless receives excellent support from Reni Santoni as Harry's eager rookie partner Chico Gonzalez, Harry Guardino as the gruff Lt. Al Bressler, John Mitchum as the jolly Frank DiGiorgio, John Larch as the stern police chief, and John Vernon as the wimpy mayor. Essential viewing.",

As tough San Francisco cop Harry Callahan, a man for whom the word 'restraint' has little or no meaning, Eastwood is the ultimate anti-hero, upholding the law by breaking every rule in the book.In this, the first of five films to star Eastwood in the role of Callahan, the city is held to ransom by a wild-eyed trigger-happy lunatic named Scorpio (convincingly played by Andrew Robinson and loosely based on the Zodiac Killer): unless the mayor (John Vernon) complies with his demands for oodles of cash, Scorpio will continue to slaughter innocent members of the public. Of course, he hasn't counted on Harry Callahan's all-consuming hatred for lowlife scum and degenerate punks which relentlessly drives the cop to hunt down the killer and dish out his own brand of brutal justice.With its blatant right-wing agenda, the film serving as an indictment of a legal system designed to protect the criminal as much as the victim, it's easy to understand how Dirty Harry might fail to find fans amongst more liberal types; but whether or not you agree with the film's political stance, it's hard to deny its effectiveness as a taut, hard-boiled thriller. Director Don Siegel gives his film an authentic, gritty vibe that portrays the seamier side of life with an unflinching eye and depicts brutal acts of violence without glamorising them. An unmistakable product of the early 70s, the film features some wild camera-work, Clint sports flowing hair, a snappy jacket and cool shades, and a groovy Lalo Schifrin score really adds to the atmosphere.For fans of hard-edged 70s cinema, this is unmissable. 10/10.",

So the movie is quite nihilistic and a bit of a fever dream of dishing out justice. Not caring about the \"system\" and how it protects bad people from being punished. It is a testament of the time it was made and one may be more sensible now with police brutality. But Harry Callahan does not discriminate. If you are a criminal, you will be subject of his anger.Having said that, many forget that while Dirty Harry stands for taking justice in your own hands, he also does things by the book - to a certain point in the movie that is. Because when he is threatened to be sued because of his \"methods\" of arresting a criminal ... well he flips the script. And while the movie is iconic and his speech about how many shots he fired is too, many get a few things wrong. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger in an interview remembers the scene before the \"Do you feel lucky? Well do ya, punk?\" wrong. Harry was eating a hot dog in that scene and he let the store owner call the police. He didn't even want to get involved. It was his break.So this is brutal, but it has a dry humor in it. A humor that may be overlooked a bit. It also has Callahan being a bit of perv, peeping Tom or however you want to call it. Not something you may delve into, because why would you? But if you watch this enough times, a lot of other things get to the surface. Like a movie theatre showing \"Play misty for me\". Surely Clints idea I'd reckon.So an Icon is born and while the movie overall may have aged a little bit, the impact the movie itself had on so many other actors and franchises cannot be stressed out enough! A lot of punks got lucky then ...",

            "content": "The very first review I read here on IMDb for \"Dirty Harry\" mentions how the Netflix streaming version is particularly dark and muddy. I'll attest to that having seen it just the other day, and it brings down one's appreciation for the film somewhat. This is the flick that took Clint Eastwood from being a spaghetti Western vigilante into a modern day, big city vigilante, if that's how one's political sensibilities wants to characterize it. I could care less whether Harry Callahan (Eastwood) quizzed criminals on whether he fired five shots or six, the fact that he got the bad guy is all that matters to me. It seems we've been battling about the rights of criminals over victims for a long time now, so it's not surprising that guys like Harry Callahan and Paul Kersey find an audience that lets folks cheer for the good guys. After a half century gone by now since the movie's release, it's reputation might be just a tad better than the original product by now, but it's still sweet to hear Harry ask some punk - \"Are you feeling lucky?\"",

            "content": "This is Clint Eastwood's iconic film, where he plays San Francisco police officer Harry Callahan, aka Dirty Harry. He is assigned to track and capture a murdering psychopath called the Scorpio, who has been terrorizing the city with homicides and demands thousands of dollars from the police in return for stopping his crime spree.The mystery begins immediately when the Scorpio strikes at the beginning of the film, grasping the audience's attention and leading to one suspenseful scene after the other as Dirty Harry tries to track down Scorpio. The manhunt of Scorpio and the random police action scenes like Harry taking down a band of robbers and dealing with a suicidal man keeps the plot momentum going strong.The cinematography by Bruce Surtees captures the tense atmosphere and bustling city life of San Francisco, with Dirty Harry roaming the streets like the loan wolf, looking to do justice and reminding you of a film-noir type setting. Don Siegel did a nice job directing, keeping the film interesting for the most part and leaving little room for boring fillers, which there are a few (like the uninteresting scenes with the dumb district attorney), but none too much to drag the main plot away from the audience. The acting was spot-on, particularly that of Eastwood's calm and collected demeanor, even when angry, and his deadpan delivery, and Andrew Robinson's deranged and crazy portrayal of Scorpio. The cat and mouse game between Harry and Scorpio consumes much of the film. It's a classic cop vs. madman movie that stands out well throughout the test of time.Grade B",

Looks very impressive in Blu-ray with magnificent opening scenes, shot from high up and far away and closing in on violent action in vivid, colourful close-up. Considering all the Italian police action films I have seen, odd that I should not have visited one of their major influences. Thinking about it Clint Eastwood is a pivotal and iconic figure, being influenced by but even more, himself influencing Italian crime and western films. This one is very tough and uncompromising and Eastwood strides through it, a man against the world, including the police officials he has to work around. Being of the early 70s the film is not as slick as one might expect today in so far as scenes crash and collide with night turning to day without a murmur. No time for niceties, its the story stupid! My only reservation, the film runs for 100 minutes, 90 would have made it more tight and we could probably have lost one of those meet ups with the major or governor. Splendid action though and again being early 70s goes out of its way to show a bit of sleaze every now and again.",

            "content": "A new kind of cop for a new decade. With \"Dirty Harry\" Siegel and Eastwood created one of cinema's most enigmatic figures in Inspector Harry Callahan, a monosyllabic, no-nonsense cop, based in San Francisco, who freely uses his Magnum 357 gun like it's an extension to his right hand and is very much of the \"shoot first, ask questions later\" school of policing.Nicknamed \"Dirty Harry\" because he always gets the dirty jobs other cops won't touch, we first see him single-handedly take down a gang robbing a bank which culminates in round one of his classic \"Do you feel lucky, punk?\" confrontations, staring down the barrel of his gun, daring said punk to go for his nearby gun and then using a similarly unconventional \"I dare you...\" interview technique to talk down a potential suicide jumper. Not a by-the-book copper then, he prefers to work alone and little cares for the politicking and compromising of his bosses, who he tolerates just so long as they don't interfere with his individual modus operandum.So here's a cop with no hinterland, we never see where we lives and just about glean that his wife died in an undetermined past and that he appears to have no kids. Married to the job, he lives for the next dirty case to fall into his lap and sure enough, along comes a sniper-killer, shooting innocent people with his long-range rifle, demanding a ransom from the city mayor to stop his promised one-a-day murdering spree.Harry's pursuit of the self-named \"Scorpio\" killer soon becomes personal between the two of them and ebbs and flows through a tense pursuit in a football stadium then a legal stand-off which sees the killer freed and finally an inevitable reckoning between the two after Scorpio has hijacked and threatened to kill a school bus containing young children.\"Dirty Harry\" set the bar for violent, uncompromising police thrillers and Eastwood proved the perfect medium for the iconic title role, in so doing, updating and adapting his earlier \"Man with no name\" characterisation from the Leone westerns to the present day. I don't think the film works completely, for one thing believing that Scorpio's character could have been built up more while some of the plotting and supporting characterisations seem somewhat haphazard and sketchy, not to mention exhibiting a little decidedly \"of its time\" casual racism and sexism. I'd also question having Harry recite again the \"Go for your gun\" ultimatum at the end as an unnecessary repetition of what was a brilliant stand-alone scene from earlier in the film, but there's no doubt with its extensive use of fluid camera-work, location photography, realistic, pared-down dialogue and explosive set-pieces, Siegel and Eastwood had happened on a dynamic template for much of what would follow in the New Hollywood of the next decade and beyond, not least a slew of its own sequels, none of which however, bettered the original.",

Tough as nails with an attitude problem to boot, Harry was a social icon which encompassed the unrelenting nature of vigilance and justice, no matter who got stepped on. While rules and laws protect those who break the law, Harry was all about going against the system, summoning the power of his .44 magnum and making crooks think twice about breaking the law. In what was Don Siegal's best film, Clint Eastwood embodied a character that seems one in the same with him. This is one of the few films where I really don't look at the technical aspects of the film simply because the attitude of the main character is what drives the movie. Coupled with a great soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin, Eastwood didn't need to tell us what his state of mind was, considering the music helped establish the mood. A great movie that will forever be unforgettable.",

            "review_title": "A Hero To The Powerless",
            "content": "Two points here. First, this film is very much a Clint Eastwood vehicle. Whether one likes this film will depend largely on whether one likes Eastwood as an actor and the character he plays, Harry Callahan. Second, the film's villain, a fictional character named \"Scorpio\", is derived loosely from the real-life Zodiac killer who terrorized the Bay Area a couple of years before this film was made.Dirty Harry is a loner San Francisco cop who does things his way. He's tough, hard-nosed, and no-nonsense. He gives the impression that he's tired and feels put-upon. He's fed up with the American legal system that, from his POV, pampers criminals. Since he operates largely outside the bounds of the law, he is a hero to Americans who feel powerless. He routinely gets the toughest assignments, and here he's assigned to Scorpio, a serial killer who kills from city rooftops.Color cinematography is quite good. There's some good sky shots of the city. A lot of scenes take place at night, which enhances suspense; these are the best scenes. My favorite sequence takes place at Mount Davidson Cross in a secluded area. With eerie sound effects, this sequence is quite suspenseful. Yet, I question how a large, densely packed city like San Francisco can be so utterly dark at night.I didn't care for the law and order political message in the film's second half. But that theme does accurately reflect American attitudes of the early 1970s. Also, Harry's distractions on a bank holdup and an attempted suicide seem superfluous. I would have preferred that the story focus exclusively on attempts to catch Scorpio. And the chase at the film's end goes on too long.Otherwise, \"Dirty Harry\", a character study of an unusual cop, is a highly suspenseful film that is well constructed. For its time, it was a violent movie, though by today's standards, it's fairly tame. For viewers who like crime genre films, and for those who like Clint Eastwood, this film probably will be worth watching.",

            "content": "\"Dirty Harry\", along with Friedkin's \"The French Connection\", is the gold standard of the action movie genre. It is what all others must be judged against for it is the best, the highest high the genre ever reached.The fact that so many aspects of the picture have become clich\u00e9d - the tough guy cop who plays by his own rules, the mayor/judge/police captain throwing the rule book at him, the partner getting hurt and \"making it personal\".Our familiarity with these clich\u00e9s only makes them all the more raw in their presence here. For one thing, Harry Callahan is anything but a typical hero - we often cringe when we see the risks he takes; this isn't a Michael Bay-style set piece where the more things that blow up, the better, and no one thinks about the lives that would've been lost. Clint Eastwood gives such an intense portrayal of a cop over the edge that we, the audience, are as scared of him as a criminal should be. When he sees his injured partner in the hospital, we know he's just keeping up appearances. Filmmakers exploited such moments in later films to make us understand and humanize the hero, but there's no such soppy stuff here.This would become less an anti-hero led action movie than a terrifying character study of a volatile policeman if not for the contrast we are forced to make with Andy Robinson's villain, one of the greatest in filmic history. If Harry is scary, the Scorpio Killer is terrifying, one of the most disturbing characters I have ever witnessed in a movie. Harry truly meets his match in the Killer; they are on a collision course that is so compelling because it is so believable. The soon-to- be clich\u00e9s are immaterial in the face of such magnetism, and that is what makes \"Dirty Harry\" so real, raw, and frightening.",

            "content": "There were cop movies before -- lots of them -- but none quite so sneaky, innovative, and unsettling as this one. It's the Tristan chord of police stories.The story, in brief, is that a serial killer is stalking San Francisco and Inspector Harry Callahan (Eastwood) tracks him down and kills him, even though it costs him his badge. The San Francisco police and the DA's office is just too hobbled by the imposition of liberal laws to handle the matter themselves. It's up to Harry to follow the law of nature, and if Harry could speak with anything resembling a flourish, he'd be shouting something like, \"You NEED me on that wall!\" Eastwood, as the central character, is Eastwood. He wears a grim mask throughout and squints at times of crisis. Well, he laughs believably once -- when he pulls the trigger on an empty chamber of the cannon he carries around and Albert Popwell, who would have been on the receiving end, quails in horror. Everyone else in the cast, down to really minor parts, out-acts Eastwood. Andy Robinson, as the killer, is great. Rarely has criminal insanity been so enacted on the screen, even if it is the show biz version of psychosis. With what extraordinary relish he beats up the little kids on the school bus he's hijacked while maniacally urging them to sing \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat.\" And when he's hurt or tortured his mouth opens into a wide oval and he howls in this high-pitched, pig-like squeal.Every surface in the movie seems clean, shiny, polished, pressed. It's a beautiful city and it's filled with well-dressed people. Harry himself is always impeccably outfitted, usually in three-piece outfits, and carefully groomed. His boss advises him to get a haircut (this is 1971) but it's clear that Harry doesn't need one because he's just emerged from his hair stylist. His gun positively scintillates. Harry stumbles over a garbage can or two but even they are empty and appear steam cleaned. Even the scumbag of a murderer is dressed in new clothing. At least his shoes are brand new and glistening. They appear to be flat-toed oxblood boots of some sort and their laces are a creamy white against the darker leather. All of us impoverished groundskeepers should have such impressive shoes.That cannon of Harry's, by the way, I should mention is endowed with, not the usual pop, but the WHOOOM! of a howitzer. It was the first time this effect was used. The other gunshots are equally impressive, though of fewer decibels. The sound department should get a medal. The Harry Gunshot was used routinely in movies for a decade afterward.You have to admire the movie for being so thoroughly politically incorrect. I don't think they could make it today. The N word is unspoken but appears in a note displayed for the audience. The sniper selects from the crowd a black man in a poncho who minces fairy-like across a street. The killer limps past a wall with a peace sign sprayed on it, and he himself wears a belt with a grotesquely distorted peace sign on it. You remember them. \"The footprint of the American chicken?\" On Mount Davidson, Harry bumps into a frightened little guy and asks him his name. \"My friends call me Alice, and I DO take a dare.\" Now, PC or not, that is a great reply.The political message of the film could have been shaped by Machiavelli. To achieve social stability, it's necessary sometimes to use methodical and perhaps cruel brute force. The movie contrasts the political idealism of those whiney legal types with the political reality of the streets. Or, as Harry puts it, \"I shoot the bastards. That's my policy.\" Yes, we need him on that wall. We need him to do our dirty work for us but we can't handle the truth.It's a repellent ideology but it's a neatly done picture. Don Siegel always seems to know what he's doing. Like most fantasies, this one isn't deep in any way. There's little in the way of ambiguity. Dirty Harry is good, the serial killer is evil, and the rest of the police are helpless, and anyway whatever they are feeling or thinking doesn't matter. \"Chinatown\" is far superior in that it shows us that the administration of justice isn't always as simple as a high school football game. But for what \"Dirty Harry\" purports to be, it ranks right up there with the best of them.",

In this first installment he is after a psychopatic that is known as ''Scorpio'' that is extorting money to citizens, and considering that Harry has his own way to deal with these subjects, I won't spoil the ending.This is probably the first movie in a line of dirty cop movies. It's very raw: there are at times bad words, some nudity here and there, graphic violence and even racial ephitets. This is not certainly a movie for kids, but for its audience it's a treat.

Harry Callahan is Clint Eastwood's best role he ever played. This movie is an action powerful masterpiece, I love this film franchise to death all 5 movies. Clint Eastwood with his .44 Magnum blow away this 70's action classic masterpiece. Their were 5 \"Dirty Harry\" movies of course 4 sequels. Magnum Force, The Enforcer, Sudden Impact and The Dead Pool and I enjoy all 5 \"Dirty Harry\" movies they are all great. There is no bad Dirty Harry movie at all. I love the cinematography, the filming locations shot in a San Francisco area. Great soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin.I love \"Dirty Harry\" movies I am a fan of this movies I grew up watching them I would say they are MILES way better movies than \"Death Wish\" franchise. The first Death Wish come out in 1974 and it become a franchise like Dirty Harry. I don't like Death Wish the first movie I couldn't get in to it. I love Superman and John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 with Dirty Harry these movies I love Death Wish I don't like.Dirty Harry come out in 1971 it was directed by wonderful director Don Siegel who worked with Eastwood before, this was their fourth movie together. Clint Eastwood plays excellent as Insp. Harry Callahan on a hunt of a serial killer Scorpio (Andy Robinson). Who is killing people and ransoms San Francisco for $100,000 to stop the killing. Insp. Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) knows he has to stop the killer, he has to be stop.Another was the quality of Clint Eastwood's character as \"Harry Callahan\", which was obviously a breakthrough for him at the time. He is best described as a smart-talking cop who hated criminals and broken the laws in serving time for the police. Harry wasn't a vigilante and he wasn't above the law. He did what he did to protect the innocents. I love how Harry jump on a bus on the roof, you have great showdown between Harry and Scorpio. Harry stabs a killer with a knife in his leg real powerful acting performance.Clint Eastwood, Reni Santoni and Andy Robinson perfectly played their roles. Andy Robinson and Reni Santoni were reunited in Cobra (1986) my favorite action film from The Cannon Group, Inc. Cobra was an Stallone's answer to Dirty Harry. Andy Robinson was in horror flick Hellraiser (1987), he was a terrific actor did a great performance ever as a psychotic killer Scorpio. Reni Santoni as Chico Gonzales partner of Insp. Harry Callahan. Those there actors in these movie are great. I love Insp. Harry Callahan famous catch praise line: I know what you're thinking. \"Did he fire six shots or only five?\" But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off, you've gotta ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\"Dirty Harry is the best action masterpiece of the 70's my personal favorite franchise movies of all time. It was box office and critical successful. I love this movie to death I do have the DVD and all 5 movies on Blu-ray disc. I love this film to death I love Insp. Harry Callahan he is my favorite action hero.",

He plays the title character, a tough, no-nonsense police detective with a reputation for getting the job done, at any price. San Francisco has the great misfortune of being home to a psychotic extortionist who begins killing random citizens in a bid to collect $100,000 from the Mayor (Vernon.) The nut-job (Robinson) has no compunction at all about who he picks off and doubles his asking price when the city officials fail to pay him in a timely enough fashion. Eastwood, along with newly-acquired partner Santoni, makes it his personal mission to bring Robinson to justice. However, Eastwood's methods don't always fall within the confines of the system and eventually, he finds himself having to go it alone in order to halt the killing spree. Eastwood created here a character that would resonate with a vast audience and be featured in four sequels. Though many were appalled at the violence and the implications of his vigilante style character, even more viewers were captivated by this anti-hero who, like them, was tired of seeing the victim getting the shaft while the criminal's rights were protected to the nth degree. Eastwood's built-in, steely determination paired with his dryly sarcastic delivery helped to form an iconic character. Robinson, in a remarkable debut, displays a sickening hysteria and a total disregard for life or authority. 1971 audiences were blown away by the vivid evil of this character and crime movies have been including variations on it ever since. Both characters influenced the genre, leaving a wave of similar \"tough cop vs psycho\" films in their wake, though few could match them. Charles Bronson would soon take vigilantism to new heights in \"Death Wish\". After years of viewing it in bad condition, panned and scanned and edited on TV, it's remarkable to revisit it on DVD and see how well it is shot and how picturesque the San Francisco settings are in widescreen. The skillful direction, interesting score by Lalo Schifrin and committed acting by most of the cast make it a stirring experience even today, when it's been imitated and, in some ways, outdone countless times. There are also a couple of amusing doses of shapely female nudity (and one rather haunting one of a young girl.) Many familiar, yet believable, supporting actors round out the cast. Kobart, who has a small but important role as a bus driver, was featured in the Broadway production and the film of \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\"! Far more bleak and stark in tone than some of its offspring, it retains a powerful punch. Though it isn't always 100% plausible, the simple seriousness of it and the bluntness of its presentation keep it more grounded than many of today's police action films.",

            "content": "San Francisco detective Harry Callahan is assigned the case of a psychopath who uses a 30-06 rifle with a silencer to shoot people from rooftops, leaving letters under the alias of Scorpio, demanding 200,000 dollars or else he will continue to kill. He will realize all too well that this case is anything but easy, Harry and his newly acquired partner(against his will of course), Chico Gonzalez(Reni Santoni)having to scour all the seedy and darkened streets for Scorpio(Andrew Robinson, as vile and heinous as they come).The reason explained in this film for Callahan's nickname is that he gets saddled with every B.S. job that comes his way, whether it's halting a suicidal jumper from leaping off a building or interrupting a robbery in progress while trying to eat his hot dog.There are instances where Callahan and the police come close to catching Scorpio, but he proves to be quite elusive. Such as when helicopters find him on a rooftop about to shoot a black man on a park bench, or when Callahan and Chico intrude upon his preparation to target a priest. Callahan gets his first close encounter with Scorpio during a money exchange with a girl's life hanging in the balance(Callahan tells his superiors that the girl is probably already dead). This girl was kidnapped, her tooth pulled and sent(along with her red bra)to the Mayor as confirmation. Scorpio sends Callahan on a wild goose chase throughout San Francisco and he must answer each telephone or else the girl dies. When he does finally meet Scorpio he receives a beating, two broken ribs but stabs the bastard in the leg. That wound will help Callahan in his further pursuit of Scorpio.Here is where people are divided:Callahan has to break some rules in order to get information out of Scorpio, by pressing down on a wound(after shooting him in the ear)he caused with a knife out of self-defense, to find out the girl's whereabouts. No Miranda or search warrant to get into Scorpio's residence in order to retrieve the rifle which is the weapon used to kill. The quandary Callahan was facing:the girl had, according to the suspect warning of Scorpio, only so much time before she would suffocate(he told the police that she was buried alive, which turns out to be a tragic lie). If he obeyed the rules, she would've been dead(he didn't know sure, definite, that Scorpio had indeed killed her already so he had to assume she was alive)and perhaps Scorpio would've gotten away without entering his abode without a warrant. There is indeed a scene where the district attorney chews Harry out for not following the rules and he seems justified in his actions in regards to the girl's life, but no evidence attained due to the lack of a search warrant, and the confession of her location were inadmissible. Ultimately, you either side with the laws that are written or care about why a cop was willing to break them in order to attempt to save a girl's life. These kinds of moments are what provide much debate and polarize a particular group. Every person has rights in this great country, but what about those victims who are denied their own? Anyway, DIRTY HARRY had a model so many others wanted to duplicate(and the other films in the series failed to in their own right), the detective who goes one step beyond the line of duty and is willing to toss his star away if it means ridding the streets of a nutcase with a rifle. Like the great scene with John Vernon's Mayor when he questions Harry's methods in Fillmore, Callahan is as open and honest as he has always been:\"When a naked man is chasing a woman through an alley with a butcher's knife and a hard-on, I figure he isn't out collecting for the Red Cross!\"Don Siegel and his cinematographer Bruce Surtees(who Eastwood used as well when he started directing)capture the city very well, and we seem to follow Eastwood into a lot of places in search of a real terror/threat. Scorpio's commandeering of a school bus, with some kids and a frightened driver inside, is sweat-inducing stuff, but he gets his comeuppance in grand style.",

There is something dissatisfying about its plot and narrative account. Although there is a basic theme involving the pursuit of a maniac killer, it is also structured round a disconnected series of episodes designed to portray a cop who is stressed and driven beyond endurance by the rules and regulations of the society in which he operates.

            "content": "\"Dirty Harry\" was a trend-setter for action films. However, when those trends include one-dimensional characters and gratuitous nudity the term trend-setter loses some of its lustre.I've seen a lot of action films over the years but I began tiring of them in my teens, mainly because I realized that if you've seen a handful of them then you've seen just about everything that the genre has to offer. That is simply because nine times out of ten one action film is just a knockoff of a better one. This movie might have been a breath of fresh air back in 1971 but today it's just a clich\u00e9 factory. Granted, it's not the filmmakers fault that countless others shamelessly copied their formula; I just feel that it wasn't a formula worth copying in the first place.The 'good' and 'bad' guys are unmistakable here. There's the no-nonsense cop pitted against the deranged serial killer. Never mind any glimpse into why Harry is so bent on justice or why Scorpio is intent on mindless destruction. As I said, the characters are completely one-dimensional; it's standard 'good guy' versus 'bad guy', with no more depth than that. Don't be fooled by the film's reputation, this is just another shallow action flick.The film's production values are pretty good, though. Don Siegel's direction is well-handled overall and is certainly above the usual action flick caliber. The score by Lalo Schifrin also has a funky, early seventies flavor. The acting is passable, though Eastwood's iconic performance is as one-note as it gets.I would recommend this film only to see what kind of impact it had on later films. Many, many mindless action flicks owe their inspiration to \"Dirty Harry\" but this is one case where the original is little better than the imitators.",

Perhaps better known as the dean in \"Animal House\" he really came through strong.I have to give the film credit for making this, so soon after the Zodiac Killer... I'm sure the fear was still fresh for many in California.

            "review_title": "A Great Vigilante Cop Thriller",
            "content": "\"Dirty Harry\" is an exciting cop thriller with plenty of action, sharp dialogue and a great deal of moral ambiguity. It's a simple story about a maverick cop's pursuit of a serial killer and for that reason has a timeless quality that makes it just as enjoyable for today's audiences as it was for those who saw it in the 1970s.After a young woman in a rooftop swimming pool is shot dead, SFPD Homicide Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) investigates and finds a note left by the lone gunman. The killer who calls himself \"Scorpio\" (Andy Robinson) demands a payment of $100,000 and threatens that if the ransom isn't paid promptly, he'll continue to kill another person everyday until his demand is met.A little while later, Scorpio carries out his threat and kills a young boy. From information contained in his ransom note, the police know that his next target is likely to be a Catholic priest and so Callahan and his rookie partner Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni) stakeout a nearby Catholic church. Their action is successful in preventing Scorpio from killing a priest but in the ensuing shootout, a police officer is killed.Scorpio goes on to kidnap and bury a young girl and then threatens to let her suffocate unless he's paid a ransom of $200,000. The Mayor of San Francisco (John Vernon) feels that he has no choice in the matter and authorises the payment to be made. Callahan is assigned to the job of delivering the money and is also instructed to do nothing that might provoke the gunman into killing his hostage. In the action that follows, however, Callahan is brutally beaten up, Gonzalez is wounded and Callahan stabs Scorpio in the leg.Callahan's efforts to bring Scorpio to justice are frustrated when he's advised by the District Attorney that no charges can be made against the killer because his rights had been violated when Callahan had searched his home without a warrant and also because he failed to observe the correct procedure when seizing Scorpio's rifle. Callahan then continues his pursuit of Scorpio operating purely under his own rules rather than those laid down by the SFPD.At the time of its release, \"Dirty Harry\" was seen to be very much in touch with the mood of the general public who had seen an obvious increase in violent crime accompanied by an apparent inability on the part of the law enforcement agencies to deal with the problem effectively. This left many people feeling vulnerable and let down by the system that was supposed to be there to protect them. The analysis of the problem as expounded by Harry Callahan was that the justice system had become too soft on criminals, criminals' rights had been given greater importance than those of the victims and the lawyers who represented suspected criminals were simply hell bent on obstructing the police in their work.Callahan's cynicism and contempt for everyone in authority led to him carrying out his duties in the style of a violent vigilante who was determined to get the desired results by whatever means necessary, even if that meant he had to use unethical methods. His readiness to abuse police powers and operate outside of the rules predictably brought him into conflict with his superiors but he knew he'd feel vindicated if his methods played a significant part in reducing the level of crime on the streets of San Francisco.Callahan is a real anti-hero who shares many of the traits displayed by Scorpio. Both men are violent, sadistic and have no respect for authority or society's rules. They're also both voyeurs and totally untroubled about the number of people that they routinely kill. Furthermore, Callahan is a bigot who even dislikes college graduates!This movie was career high for Clint Eastwood whose portrayal of his character is perfect as it captures so brilliantly the intensity and depth of the disgust and hatred that Callahan feels for so many people. The fact that his character is naturally reticent and softly spoken makes this achievement even greater.\"Dirty Harry\" was well received by both the public and a majority of the critics which is understandable because it's a piece of entertainment that an be viewed either as a simplistic story that can be enjoyed purely on a visceral level or one that can be used to consider the deeper issues that it raises.",

He's the type that shoots first and asks questions later--screw giving them a fair trial or realizing their rights. A psychotic killed named Scorpio (Andrew Robinson) is killing victims randomly throughout San Francisco. He demands $100,000 to stop killing people. Harry and his partner Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santon) go out to get him--but can Harry play by the rules? This was a mega hit when it came out in 1971 and led to a whole series of Dirty Harry films. Basically this is just a celebration of killing people in cold blood and being proud of it. We're encouraged to cheer on Harry when he kills or wounds people. Who cares if they're not given a fair trial or have rights like those silly liberals keep saying? (For the record--I'm a liberal and I'm being very sarcastic). I find that message pretty disturbing. To make matters worse this film is VERY black and white. All the cops are saints and the killer is pure evil. This is ridiculously simplistic and false.The story is stupid--full of dubious logic (the cops let Scorpio walk even after they KNOW he's killed people) and boring characters. The action scenes are pretty exciting but the movie has long, boring stretches (the sequence where Scorpio has Harry running all around San Fran goes on forever). Also--why does Harry have a black partner? It seems the only reason is so people in the audience won't think he's racist. He's a killer but not racist--that's a good thing. (Yes, I'm being sarcastic again). The movie gets VERY disturbing at the end when young kids are put in danger and are slapped around. This seems to be in the movie only to make sure the audience hates Scorpio completely. The acting is OK. Eastwood gives his usual wooden performance (however it DOES work) and Robinson is convincing (but overdoes it at times) as the killer.Technically the film is well-done and packaged but it's slow, reactionary garbage that panders to the audiences worst instincts. This gets a 5 only for the action and some nice direction. Cute little in joke--Harry walks part a movie theatre that's playing \"Play Misty For Me\"--a film that Eastwood directed and starred in the year before this came out.",

The one thing he didn't count on was Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) who plays by his own rules. I've always found it amazing that DIRTY HARRY received so much controversy back when it was released and watching it forty-two years later it's somewhat scary seeing the various \"warnings\" here coming true. I think this film says quite a bit about the \"bad\" people being protected while the victims are forgotten and the bad guys often get released back onto the streets to harm more innocent people. It's clear that director Don Siegel and star Eastwood had a political agenda when they made this but that's one thing that makes it so special after so many years because not too many films had the guts to go in this direction. The film is masterfully directed by Siegel who knows how to build up the tension in each of the scenes without creating any fake emotions or scenes just there to try and make the viewer feel good. The film is a really dark, rather creepy and at times disturbing look at some very bad subjects (heck, two children are murdered) yet Siegel never makes it so dark where the viewer is turned off. There are many brilliantly done action scenes here including the infamous \"do you feel lucky\" sequence but the entire sequence where Eastwood has to run around from phone booth to booth is just perfect as is the sequence where he finally gets his hands on the bad guy. Speaking of Eastwood, is there anyone in the history of cinema that could have done this role more justice? The laid back, calm, cool and collective style of Eastwood is just right for this role and especially some of the darker humor. Eastwood is the perfect person for this type of tough guy role and he perfectly milks every scene. Robinson makes for one of the sleaziest and most hated villains in film history and think he never gets the credit he deserves. Harry Cuardino, John Mitchum and John Vernon are also good in their roles. As the series went along I think some winks and one-liners were aimed at the viewers and for the most part the sequels were fun. DIRTY HARRY, the original, is something different as it certainly has a message to give and it's also quite tense and disturbing with some of its subject matter. It's certainly a film that plays just as well today as it did when it was first released.",

            "content": "Released in 1971 and directed by Don Siegel, \"Dirty Harry\" stars Clint Eastwood in the eponymous role as a no-nonsense San Francisco detective sick of the liberal constraints on cops and the corresponding pro-thug mentality. With a new partner (Reni Santoni) he seeks a mad murderer (Andrew Robinson) who takes advantage of the libertine protections of the system.I'm a fan of all five of the Dirty Harry films, which are as follows: \"Dirty Harry\" (1971), \"Magnum Force\" (1973), \"The Enforcer\" (1976), \"Sudden Impact\" (1983) and \"The Dead Pool\" (1988).\"Magnum Force\" is my favorite, a rare case where the sequel is superior to the original. The two films compliment each other well because their stories are sort of the inverse of the other. In this film Harry becomes a vigilante cop in order to take down a psycho thug, yet only to a point, whereas in \"Magnum Force\" he is forced to take down vigilante cops who have gone too far in their efforts to tackle rampant crime. The latter represent Harry if he DIDN'T pull in the reigns after this movie.My second favorite is the nigh-surreal \"Sudden Impact\" while this one is my least preferred, although I still like it. I just think the stories in the four sequels have more drive. \"Dirty Harry\" seems languid and hollow by comparison. Moreover, the villain, Scorpio, is so annoying; and the way he gets away with his crimes via legal loopholes and the idiocy of the authorities and their pro-thug system is so aggravating (and, yes, I realize that was the point).The cinematography is great with several high shots of the Bay area. Speaking of which, there's a pervading dead ambiance about the movie with its intermittent insights about the city, the sad hollowness thereof and the meaninglessness of life in general. Harry seems to say eff it, and gets his job done, with or without the sanction of his superiors.The film runs 102 minutes and was shot in San Francisco, with studio work done in Burbank. The screenplay was written by Harry Julian Fink & Rita M. Fink with the additions of several others (e.g. John Milius).GRADE: B",

            "content": "I suppose part of the reason Dirty Harry has become such a classic film, such a memorable film is because of its famous line revolving around Magnum handguns, the amount of bullets they can fire and weather or not a certain somebody feels 'lucky'. But apart from this line giving it legendary status, Dirty Harry is actually a very impressive and entertaining piece of film-making for a number of reasons.Harry Callahan (Eastwood) embodies everything that a hard bodied, hard boiled cop-come-anti-hero character needs to embody. The opening scene in which we see Callaghan is when he is called into the office of the mayor, someone who is superior in terms of authority, and he tells him exactly what's what in the sense he's been waiting around for a while before being called in; Callahan also closes his first scene with a line regarding policy, pointing out the line between what's right, wrong and the correct thing to do in a certain situation \u0096 this relates directly to an incident involving an attempted rape Harry foiled a while back. From this very first opening scene, we get the impression that Harry is a guy who will go against the rules and do things his way: \"That's your policy, not mine\" he tells the mayor and it sticks throughout. But rather than just get its protagonist correct, Dirty Harry contains a string of impressive and entertaining themes and scenes that all work together to produce a good film.I think what's interesting is the way the film takes a certain approach to its bad guy. Indeed, the first scene of the entire film is the killer himself making his first hit before a few scenes later showing us exactly what the killer looks like in full view. This isn't so much a detective story where the emphasis is 'who done it' as it is 'here I am, come and get me'. By showing the killer and what he looks like before he makes his mere second hit is an interesting move and a different approach to how certain other films may have tackled the material. Not only this but it sort of makes the audience a little self aware; instead of having us try and figure out who it is and why he's doing it, we get to see his face within the opening twenty minutes as he eyes up his next victim, giving off an extremely dangerous persona of the killer; a certain Scorpio (Robinson).But this is something else the film includes in terms of subject matter: voyeurism. The film is extremely voyeuristic; Scorpio looks at an attractive girl swimming in a rooftop pool through his sniper scope for a bit of amusement before shooting her; thus delaying the seemingly obvious murder just that while longer for the audience to mull over. Not only this but it gives the killer, who we know nothing about at this point since it's the first scene, an added sense of insanity that the audience will no doubt build upon. The film plays with who looks at who and the position of power within the frame; the girl may be on a rooftop but Scorpio is on an even higher rooftop; thus looking down. The same technique is played with through Harry himself. When he is attempting to scope out the killer with his partner on a rooftop after some bait had been set up, he uses the binoculars to gaze upon a naked woman in an apartment thus veering away from his job. He is again, looking with her having no knowledge of it and from an elevated position; interesting how the last time this happened in the film, it was Scorpio doing it and a murder followed soon afterward: will a similar chain of events follow now that the voyeuristic action has been carried out? They are there to lure the killer into killing once again, after all so all these things combine in the scene and will, hopefully, play on the audience's minds as they watch on.Away from analysis of the film, an historical placement must be mentioned. This film was made half a dozen years after the assassination of Kennedy; a person I now know a lot more about in terms of importance and conspiracy thanks to 1991s JFK, but the film was also made round about the time of Zodiac; a subject I was also informed a lot more on thanks to a recent film of the same name. I find it fascinating how in the opening scenes when they read out who wrote the letter, they tell everyone they'll be searching for people's birthdays between October 24th and November 22nd. Someone asks why; but the police merely say it's because of the Scorpio star-sign - nobody mentions 'Zodiac' or the Zodiac astrology setup; something I can only put down to the fact the word Zodiac would've just reminded audiences of the events that were going on at that time and in San Francisco. Dirty Harry is a film that intrigues with its narrative, disturbs with its scenes of voyeurism and insane antagonist whilst all the time feeling real and gritty enough to be a serious crime film. The scenes of Harry merely doing his job early on as he works on the case in-between scenes are great simply for the fact the screenplay is terrific. Dirty Harry is fast, fun, gritty, disturbing and contains enough deeper elements to render it far more memorable than for one mere line of dialogue; but what a line that is anyway.",

Siegel's restrained direction makes sure the plot never strays from its path or goes overboard, and derives its best moments from the tense & gripping scenes between the loose-cannon inspector & the crazy killer, at times blurring the thin line that separates them.Harry Callahan is a thoroughly fascinating character. He is ruthless, unforgiving & not to be messed with. That much is clear from the moment he is introduced to us. But what makes him so cool & compelling in spite of his questionable traits is Clint Eastwood's strong, muscular & charismatic performance. It is one of his best roles, and is tailor-made for his talents. Andy Robinson is worth a mention for his chilling input but this is Eastwood's show all the way.Overall, Dirty Harry is as influential as it is controversial and continues to be one of the greatest examples of its genre. Callahan's middle finger to political correctness is sure to rile up few easily outraged viewers but this is a solid piece of high-quality old-school extravaganza that has aged amazingly well over the years, and packs a powerful punch even today. Undeniably amongst the finest entries in the careers of both its cast n crew, Dirty Harry delivers on all fronts. So go ahead, make your day.",

It's influential - not only is the formula used for a zillion other movies (Before John McClain, there was Dirty Harry), but John Benet Ramsey's 'kidnappers' even lifted quotes from the movie to use in their 'ransom note'. Dirty Harry, the racist cop, became part of the societal consciousness. \"Do you feel lucky, Punk?\" was probably on bumper stickers in trailer parks across the United States in the 1970's. The sub-plot of 'Good Police Work v Miranda Rights' makes this film even more culturally significant. Dirty Harry is a microcosm of the thoughts, feelings, and fears of Americans in the 1970's. Mixed with beautiful cinematography shots of San Fransisco, this film is a must-see and a classic.Real Review Posting Scoring Criteria:Acting - 1/1\nCasting - 1/1\nDirecting - 1/1\nStory - 1/1\nWriting/Screenplay - 1/1Total Base Score = 5Modifiers: (+ or -)Cinematography: 1\nQuotability: 1\nImportance To Genre: 1\nCultural Significance: 1Total Real Review Rating: 9",

A sniper calling himself Scorpio is terrorising the city, picking off victims from rooftops, and demanding a huge ransom from the mayor. Inspector Callahan (Eastwood) is given the task of stopping him, but his unorthodox way of doing things quickly brings him into conflict with his superiors. For me this is Clint's biggest and best performance to date. Some may argue it's simply the Man with no name, given a name and dumped in San Francisco. But I don't see it that way. Harry is much flashier and wittier than than the man with no name.Siegel messes with usual cop thriller convention. The identity of the killer is revealed almost straight away and he is hardly the cunning criminal that cops of Harry's calibre usually have to face. Also Scorpio is a terrible serial killer!! OK... he's pretty good at killing, but it's only blind luck that stops him from getting caught by police no fewer than three times in the first 40 minutes. Harry's biggest adversary is actually the law itself, since Scorpio is captured at the film's mid-point, but our hero's disregard for due process and the killer's 'rights' see him released back into society.The legal argument represented by John Vernon's do-gooder mayor) is well presented, and even though he ultimately gets his man, Harry's catalogue of citizen endangering stunts, in particular risking the lives of a busload of kidnapped schoolkids during the climax, remain questionable at best.Whilst there had been cinematic psychopaths before, Scorpio is given no background, no real motives for his crime and he doesn't even have a real name!! Likewise, we may not find out much about Harry, we know his wife recently died, but that's really it!! but the mix of conviction and disgust with which he goes about his job say more than any number of speeches about the rights and wrongs of modern police work ever could.A 10/10 for me.Dirty Harry grossed at the domestic box office to end 1971 the 4th highest grossing movie of the year!! Making 2 personal bests for Clint.",

            "content": "In the wake of a horrible serial killer named The Zodiac Killer was fear and terror that must have swallowed up the San Francisco area back in the late 60s. Perhaps the only good thing that came because of the horrors of a still unknown murderer was DIRTY HARRY. This was Hollywood's answer to a creep running around San Francisco killing innocent strangers.Clint Eastwood stars as Inspector Harry Callahan. To me the greatest cop in film history. He has his own way to get things done and his main and perhaps at times only priority is to catch the criminal. Harry really is bad ass and every role in which a cop has got attitude after this film takes its inspiration from this character. Not to mention in my opinion they kind of play second fiddle to Harry Callahan. Nobody could outdo what Eastwood did. We see him single-handedly stop burglars early in the film (a scene that I think was extremely well shot), which is also the first time we see his 44 Magnum in action.A psycho killer naming himself Scorpio (extremely well played by Andy Robinson) is going through the streets of San Francisco killing innocent people. Callahan has been assigned to the case and now spends the entire film trying to capture the killer. Robinson is so good in the role you should have a growing dislike towards his character right from the first scene.Really has a spectacular score from Lalo Schifrin who really wears the crown of \"cop movie\" scores as he scored BULLITT as well. Film really is an amazing mix of action, some great dialogue, humour, the early 70s in San Francisco and a really bad villain that needs to be stopped. Now, I have never visited San Francisco in my life, but that is one thing that this and the four sequels do is place you in San Francisco. I feel like I have visited the place after watching this movie. Much like BULLITT did as well. So, I just hope that to people that lived in those places at those times that it was a true feeling of San Francisco that you are receiving.Directed by Don Siegel and I do believe he was a great director. He and Eastwood teamed up for five movies together and all were really good. The others were COOGAN'S BLUFF, TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA, THE BEGUILED and ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ. I think in this film there are some real beautiful shots like Harry standing with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background only to be revealed perhaps the ugliest shot in the film where the body of a victim is found.Also starring Harry Guardino as Lt. Bressler (Harry's boss), Reni Santoni as Inspector Gonzales (Harry's partner), John Mitchum (yes, that's Robert's brother) as Inspector De Giorgio and John Vernon as the mayor.If you have never seen it I say give it a shot if you like cop movies, just remember though it was made in 1971 and the city was also in the midst of perhaps its scariest time within its own history. Followed by four sequels (MAGNUM FORCE was next) all of which were really good, too.",

The movie makes evocative use of its San Francisco locations as cop Harry Callahan (Eastwood) tracks the elusive \"Scorpio killer\" who has been terrorizing the city by the Bay. As the psychopath's trail grows hotter, Harry becomes increasingly impatient and intolerant of the frustrating obstacles (departmental red tape, individuals' civil rights) that he feels are keeping him from doing his job. A characteristically taut and tense piece of film-making from Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Shootist, Escape from Alcatraz), it also remains a fascinating slice of American pop culture. It was a big hit (followed by four sequels) that obviously reflected--or exploited--the almost obsessive or paranoid fears and frustrations many Americans felt about crime in the streets. At a time when \"law and order\" was a familiar slogan for political candidates, Harry Callahan may have represented neither, but from his point of view his job was simple: stop criminals. To him that end justified any means he deemed necessary.",

            "content": "The more I think about this film, the more the way this message movie was presented and the way it has been received by many really annoys me. I'm especially sensitized, given that Bush n' co. spent most of the last decade taking away our rights in the name of \"security\" & \"safety\". They must've loved this film!The message seems to be a very reactionary one. Rights/legal protections are bad. Rule of law is useless. Vigalante abuse of power is great.This movie is full of several logical fallacies, generalizations and other issues. It sets up a False Dilemma -either ignore the laws & get to kill the guy OR he goes free. It also sets up a Straw Man argument of picking a very rare/unlikely instance of a super psycho as an argument of why honoring the rights of criminals is bad.Sure, it's really easy to set up a grossly exaggerated portrait of an inhumanely disturbed racist monster who killed at random, raped & threatened children, threatens priests & had no redeeming values. Then show how all those pesky civil rights helped him go free and kill again. Blame the civil rights! Showing the rare instance when something that GENERALLY is a good thing failed (NOTE: it didn't work because HARRY did not follow the rules- not because the rules were there!) and then use that as an excuse to rant about the rules and make it seems as if there is no point to them.No grey areas. No thoughts as to what argument means if you carry it out the whole way through. No consideration on why those rights exist or the positives of protection, especially for someone who may be innocent.Think about it- how often does SF suffer at the hands of a madman serial killer? Not since the 70's. I just checked the crime stats for SF for the last 2 months. Not a single murder. Sure, SF isn't crime free there were probably a thousand or so burglaries, robberies, etc. But I'd much rather have strong rights and let a few people (mostly non-violent offenders) get to go free because their rights were protect then to not have Miranda rights or the 4th amendment. I'll take my chances that a psycho killer may come if it means I don't have to live in a fascist state with no expectation of privacy. I don't want some admittedly racist misanthropic cop who feels that he can doing anything he want & shoot anyone he wants if he even *thinks* they're being bad. What happens when Harry shoots an innocent person? What would have happened if that guy at Kezar stadium had been innocent and Harry had beat the crap out of him? Is that OK because Harry's *usually* killing bad guys?To be fair, I did check and it looks like \"exigent circumstances\" that allow for a LEGAL warrantless search if \"necessary to prevent physical harm\" doesn't appear to have become solidified until after the film (in '76)And what was the point of the lingering shot of the killer wearing a peace sign belt buckle? Was it merely supposed to be ironic because he was a killer? Or was it meant to equate a merciless killer with those stupid\"peace-loving hippies\" who are causing murders to go free by advocating for rights and opposing oppressive police practices?In the end, I chose to read the final scene as Harry goading the killer into an action so that he had an excuse to shoot him. Then Harry realizing he had no right to uphold the law as an officer if he could not follow the laws. So he threw away the badge as an admission of his failure. However it seems to me as though many reviewers saw his action in an opposite light, of choosing to reject the rule of law and embrace his vigilante ways.",

            "content": "Down, dirty and straight to the motherf******** point, \"Dirty Harry\" is unquestionably one of those movies that truly defines the most wonderful decade in cinema, namely the glorious & sleaze-tastic 70's! Released in the 1971, and what a shock it must have been to some, this film states clear once and for all that flower-power influences are dead, buried and gone forever. The story is no-nonsense & comfortingly simplistic, the atmosphere of the film is thoroughly gritty, the character drawings and underlying messages are politically incorrect as hell and the depiction of violence is disturbing in-your-face graphic. Also, and even more so than the Italian westerns he starred in, \"Dirty Harry\" is THE motion picture that turned Clint Eastwood into an immortally cool dude and this reputation will stay with him forever, no matter how many films like \"The Bridges of Madison County\" he makes. The roughness and brutally featuring in \"Dirty Harry\" has rarely been equaled afterwards, not even in any of the sequels, and it's safe to say movies like this simply can't be made anymore. 'Dirty' Harry Callahan is a relentless and totally fearless San Franciscan copper. His ideals and operating methods are highly efficient but questionably, to say the least, and his police badge is often the only thing that distinguishes Harry from the scrum he chases on the streets. They call him \"Dirty Harry\" not only because he accepts even the most dangerous jobs without ever contemplating about the possible consequences, but also because he's a severely asocial, introvert and cynical person to work with. One of the supportive characters effectively states: \"The great thing about Harry is that he doesn't discriminate. He hates everyone\", which is sublimely contradict to the way of life in the 1960's, when dreadful messages of peace, love and understanding were exaggeratedly spread; especially in San Francisco. Callahan's latest assignment is to track down an obviously deranged serial killer that randomly shoots people from rooftops using a sniper's gun. He, who calls himself the Scorpio Killer, wants the city of San Francisco to pay him $100.000, if not he threatens to kill a different person each day. Harry and his new partner trace down Scorpio quite fast, but their unorthodox investigation methods cause conflicts with the regular law system. The authorities are forced to release Scorpio, where he naturally reprises his psychopathic tendencies. But Harry's back on his tail, and this time he won't just put him under simple arrest\u0085 The screenplay is quite rudimentary, but nevertheless highly compelling, slick and surprisingly realistic. The Scorpio obviously isn't a criminal mastermind (he re-uses the same rooftop twice, he seeks medical attention in the hospital across the street of where he lives, \u0085) but a convincingly dangerous and unpredictable psycho. You never fully know what he's capable of, especially not when he hijacks a school bus with seven children on board. The Scorpio Killer is a hyperactive and mad-raving creep whereas Harry Callahan is a broodingly calm and self-assured law enforcer, and the cat-and-mouse game between these two opposite characters is nothing short of brilliant. By the way, portraying the Scorpio Killer in \"Dirty Harry\" was a brilliant debut for Andrew Robinson, who sadly remained underrated throughout his entire career. Apart from this role, cult and horror fans will certainly remember him best as Larry Cotton in the original \"Hellraiser\". The film is roughly filmed and abruptly edited, without fancy camera tricks or enchanting scenery on the side. Actually, I rarely ever saw a movie that was shot in San Francisco and gave such an ugly and mean-spirited image of the city. The exteriors are dark, depressing and the complete opposite of the usual postcard view we get served. Everything about this film is brilliant, legendary and pure classic. A must see!",

Sure, it has a solid foundation and I do like the midpoint twist concerning the fate of the killer, but it is also a bit on the slow side and the runtime could be cut down quite significantly.Rather it's the character that makes this such a memorable film. We don't necessarily remember just how the crime got solved or what exactly the killer was doing. But we do remember how impossibly cool Eastwood as Harry Callahan was, walking down the street with a .44 Magnum in hand. There's even a scene in the film where Callahan has to talk to a jumper. And even that is cool.Not a perfect film by any means, but Dirty Harry is one of those archetype characters. A renegade, a loose cannon, a man who gets things done no matter what.

            "content": "Here we see the influence of Fritz Lang's M decades after its release. There's the emphasis on process and the absolutely insane antagonist serial killer. Where there are differences are the obvious setting changes, but also the focus on an individual investigator and how the official process can outright fail. Made by Don Siegel in his consummately professional manner, there's little flashy about this film stylistically, and he creates an engrossing tale of procedural obsession in the face of pure evil, all without ever hiding who the bad guy is once. He's in the opening scene, and everything.A killer who calls himself Scorpio (Andy Robinson) uses a sniper rifle to terrorize the city of San Francisco, starting with a woman in a rooftop pool while leaving a note (akin to Zodiac whom partially inspired Scorpio) threatening more. To the case, the chief of police Dacanelli (John Larch) assigns Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) whom everyone in the department calls Dirty Harry because he gets all the dirty jobs. Aside from the opening scene introducing the overall threat of the film, the early scenes are all designed to introduce Callahan, and he's an interesting character. His description of the attempted rape he stopped the year before is so clearly drawn in stark terms that he even gets the mayor (John Verner) to agree with his take. Of course, the big introduction is the foiling of the bank robbery where Callahan has his famous little soliloquy about his dear .44 Magnum, and it shows how he's chaotic good. He's going to stop the evil doing, and he's going to do it his way, in just enough time to finish his bite of hot dog.The movie then becomes concerned with the process of tracking down Scorpio. A police helicopter spots him on a roof across from the park of Saints Peter and Paul Church, but Scorpio gets away. With a description, the police are set on a search throughout the sprawling, messy city to find someone matching that description, and Harry and his new partner Chico (Reni Santoni) spend the night tailing a guy who has a similar bag, only for Harry to get sucker punched by some locals as a Peeping Tom. I think the weakest part of the plotting of the film ends up being the plan to try and corner Scorpio, having Callahan and Chico alone on a roof across from the roof Scorpio had been seen at with nary any backup around. It works because movie, of course, but it's thin. It does give some nice time for Harry to peep in on a naked woman inviting a couple into her apartment (he really does seem to be a Peeping Tom).Angry and having gotten away, Scorpio ups his game to the point where the mayor decides to simply give in, and Harry gets the job of being bagman to deliver the $200,000 ransom in order to save a girl Scorpio has kidnapped and buried alive with enough air until 3 am. Scorpio puts him on a runaround the city, going from one public phonebooth to the next on foot, while Chico follows in the car, using an early 70s listening device to keep up with the instructions Scorpio is giving Callahan. Exhausted, Callahan runs through the night, desperately trying to keep up and avoid unnecessary delays (pulling his gun a couple of times to get people out of his way), culminating in a meeting at the Mount Davidson cross where Scorpio shows the depths of his evil to Callahan. The chase continues on foot with Callahan tracking Scorpio down to Kezar Stadium where Callahan tortures the man to giving up the location.Where Dirty Harry really diverges from M is here. M was all about the precise process without worry about breaking laws to achieve the goal. Dirty Harry has a relatively realistic view of criminal justice in the early 70s, and Callahan's actions simply do not conform to them. He illegally searched premises, illegally seized evidence, and tortured a suspect. There's no way the district attorney will be able to use any of the evidence Callahan found in any kind of trial. Callahan is beyond pissed. Not only did he collect all of the evidence that easily lays out Scorpio's guilt, he got an actual confession, not just of the accurate location of the missing girl, but Scorpio's deeply rooted evil. Scorpio is bad and broken, but the civil government can't touch him. I think Harry would have been angry but understanding of the situation if the civil government had decided to keep a close eye on Scorpio after they let him go from the hospital, but they were too scared to even approach him. Their love of the process and fear of reprisal from the press tied their hands to the point where they simply let this murderer go without any strings. One time, I might have considered that unrealistic, but not anymore.With Callahan on Scorpio's back, tailing him on his off hours, Scorpio can't get anything done, so he pays someone to beat him up, blames it on Callahan, and gets the room he needs, stealing a school bus with several children in it, and negotiating for his money and a jet plane. Callahan gets orders to not interfere, but we all know Harry Callahan at this point. He's Dirty Harry for a reason, and it's not just because he gets the dirty jobs. He attracts himself to them.As I started the film, the first thing in my mind was Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, that portrait of San Francisco in the 1950s, all height of fashion as was Hitchcock's mien. Here, just over a decade later, San Francisco seems to have greatly changed, and not for the better. There are porn shops and strip clubs. There's permissiveness of all sorts of activities on the street that wouldn't fit with the well-manicured and dressed men and women dealing with height issues. That moment where Callahan watches a woman disrobe and blithely welcome two guests into her home is not indicative of the same city. It's a city in the process of change, and that change carries a lot of negatives along with it, including the spinelessness of the civic officials who keep wanting to just give into the madman on the loose instead of trying to actually deal with it. They're effectively just keeping their hands off on a city that is in the opening stages of degradation. This is a milder vision of societal collapse than Death Wish, but it's obviously of the same vein. It's a city willingly giving up the gains and one man who can't understand why.And that's the underlying conceit under the whole thing, providing a wonderful subtext to a film that it feels like everyone knew was there. It gives real strength to the decisions of the lone ranger out of time, unable to understand the bureaucratic need for the protection of evil men. Don Siegel manages everything so well, giving real professionalism to a story that really could have been no more than mere exploitation. There are ideas afloat, all buoyed by Eastwood's rock-solid central performance while everyone around him manages well on their own.It's a star making film for a man who was already a star, evidence that he was really one of the biggest men in Hollywood at the time and really understood his own star power, surrounded by other creatives who understood it as well as he did. There's some roughness that gets me, but otherwise, this is an intelligent, tense thriller that builds on what came before and really provides a great twist on well-worn formula.",

The film is shot beautifully, with some truly captivating cinematography, and a welcome color palate.

Sure, it's (arguably) based entirely on the idea that, though the American justice system is made to ensure that said justice is done, the bad guys punished and the good guys safe from them is ineffectual and can only be achieved by going beyond said law, making said justice system seem somewhat pointless... but it's darn entertaining, and it's certainly hard not to agree with Harry's cause. Harry is the man's man; he's direct, doesn't take crap from anybody and he goes to extreme lengths to fight for what he believes in. A character masterfully committed to the screen by Clint Eastwood, who only succeeds acting ability in directing ability, he is the essence of what men dream of being: powerful and in control, without having lost sight of what they should fight for, what they've wanted to fight for since before they got any power. One can argue that Harry is a loose cannon and somewhat less than the general public's view of a 'good cop'... but it's hard to argue with his results. He does get the job done. This is very much a guy flick... I don't really see many women enjoying it. The plot is interesting, quite original, too, and it keeps your interest all the way through the film. The pacing is excellent, with few scenes evoking any boredom in the viewer. The acting is mostly good, though there are a few obvious exceptions. The writing exceeds most films of the genre, but isn't completely shy of a few clich\u00e9s and stereotypes. The dialog mostly works well, though some lines are just... bad. You gotta love the famous exchange by Harry, though... \"I know what you're thinking. \"Did he fire six shots or only five?\" Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself a question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?\" One of the best of the genre, and one to watch for every guy out there. Very cool. 8/10",

Rewatching the film, it holds up as a tight piece of storytelling, as you would expect from veteran Hollywood director Don Siegel (\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" \"Riot in Cell Block 11\" \"The Big Steal\" \"Coogan's Bluff\" \"Escape from Alcatraz\"). What's hard for me to know is how this film would be received by someone watching it now for the first time, because \"Dirty Harry\" has been endlessly imitated over the years, having been the originator of innumerable action film tropes (cop as anti-hero, the veteran cop saddled with unwanted college-boy partner, telling his superiors \"you can have my badge,\" big exotic guns, \"What about the rights of that little girl?\", the DA having to release a suspect over illegally obtained evidence, a young cop barfing at the sight of a dead body, not to mention the film's finale, and many, many more), as well as featuring a wildly politically incorrect hero. I'd think that the film would still work for modern audiences in terms of pacing, storytelling, and suspense. Eastwood commands the screen and is supremely charismatic in this iconic role. There are so many classic moments in the film, from the oft quoted bank robbery scene, which was ghost written by the great John Milius (\"Conan the Barbarian\" \"Red Dawn\" \"The Wind and the Lion\"):\"I know what you're thinking, punk. You're thinking 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Now, to tell you the truth, I forgot myself in all this excitement. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and will blow your head clean off, you've gotta ask yourself a question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?\"The scene works even better with Harry's nonchalance to the chaos around him is wonderfully accented by his casually finishing off his hot dog while shooting bank robbers. Later in the film there's the wild scene at the cross when Harry is supposed to give Scorpio a ransom payoff, but ends up stabbing him in the leg, with a crazy cut to Robinson's bizarre and primal scream. There's also the memorable football stadium sequence, where Lalo Schiffrin's excellent score perfectly compliments this shockingly tough sequence. What doesn't age as well is Harry's overt racism and disregard for basic civil rights. It's debatable if a character like Archie Bunker would work today, but the Noble-Bigot-with-a-Badge does not work nearly as well in today's political climate. I considered including a quote from the film as an example, but the racist quips are insidious in how deceitfully charming they come off. In the film's defense, director Siegel has gone on record as saying, \"I was telling the story of a hard-nosed cop and a dangerous killer. What my liberal friends did not grasp was that the cop is almost as evil, in his way, as the sniper.\" Although that may have been true for this picture, it's not as much in the subsequent Dirty Harry films, where he is very much the hero (although the second film had somewhat of a rebuttal to these criticisms by making the villains vigilante cops Harry had to go up against). Also in the film's defense, Eastwood himself made something of a spiritual sequel to the Dirty Harry films with \"Gran Torino,\" in which he played a similar bigoted character, a Korean War veteran who catches his Hmong American neighbor boy trying to steal his car, but subsequently developed a relationship with the boy and his family. Torino could easily have become another powerful white man saves the day type of story, but it's instead more of a meditation on the brand of macho hero (and often racist, sexist, homophobic, etc.) which Eastwood helped to create. Still, \"Dirty Harry\" could never be made today and I think Eli Roth's remake of \"Death Wish\" is evidence of how this type of film just no longer works and in some ways is like trying to bring back minstrel shows. Still, taken as an artifact of its time and in terms on cinematic style and charismatic characters, \"Dirty Harry\" remains an iconic although admittedly politically dubious film.",

Clint Eastwood plays \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan, sneering a lot and playing off the machismo dream (and how most men would love to walk through fire, talking tough in a gravelly monotone).

The 'Model 29', with a Magnum powered cartridge (produced by Smith an Wesson), was previously only a specialist weapon, until this movie came out (in 71) and then sales just exploded through the roof. Another feather in the cap for maverick film maker Don Siegel is its script, with some of the most quotable lines ever delivered. I can only think of 'Taxi Driver' that get's as much parody, to these finely delivered words:- \"Did he fire six shots or only five?\" Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself.

The story of SF Police detective Harry Callahan specialized in the dirty jobs that nobody wants to undertake, facing a system of laws and rules which seems to favor the bad guys and not the law enforcers looks for the viewer today quite 'deja vu'. We also have seen many times the junior policeman partner becoming a key help and element in the action, and even the car scenes on San Francisco's streets. The psycho serial killer, the weak politicians ready to give up to blackmail in order to win some moments of apparent peace, all look familiar. The merit of director Siegel's film is that in 1971 he was the first to bring together all these themes and characters in one coherent and well told story, without many convolutions or ramifications.Clint Eastwood gives up here the Wild West poncho and replaces it with the elegant jacket of the 20th century policeman, but brings here from the previous films the calm, the art of handling guns and the scarcity of words which when infringed leaves room for many memorable phrases. Eastwood's character faces dilemmas similar to the one that '24''s Jack Bauer will face more than three decades later. When human lives are in balance are officers of law allowed to break rules and take the law in their hands? When the judicial system is unable to defend the victims and punish the guilty can one man take the responsibility of playing the judge and the executor? (with no less than a punishment but the deserved capital one). It's easier to answer such questions in movies than in real life. 'Dirty Harry' and many other films that followed gave to such question simplistic and problematic answers. As they say - 'do not try this at home'. At the end of the day this is still entertainment, reality is more complex.",

            "content": "Ever since the Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western trilogy from 1964-1966, Clint Eastwood had been growing as a popular action actor. And when \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" was released in 1966, he became one of the most popular in the world. However, it wasn't until five years later that he became a superstar.\"Dirty Harry\" in 1971 was the movie that really made Eastwood a hero. Going from a gun-handy cowboy to a rough and never-say-die San Francisco cop. Under the command of director famed action director Don Siegal, Eastwood highly excelled in this movie. His portrayal as Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan is a truly memorable one. I find it hard to believe he didn't get any Oscar nominations for this movie. And it was so well-liked and popular that four sequels followed, one of which Clint directed himself.But the original \"Dirty Harry\" is definitely the most memorable. Clint Eastwood as a hard-to-beat cop armed with the extremely deadly .44 Magnum revolver and a never-say-die attitude. What is more, it was also this movie that helped Clint develop the skills he needed to become an Oscar-winning director. This and the experiences he got from Sergio Leone helped him get to the point where he would win four Academy Awards within a twelve-year period.But enough with the impact \"Dirty Harry\" made on Eastwood's life. Let's go to the movie itself. It is a powerful one. It has a terrific plot, great actors, and it is definitely not short of action sequences, all of which are intense and powerful. We love to see him firing away with his .44 Magnum, blowing his adversaries into a bloody fate. And the fact that he only misses his aim on the most difficult circumstances is a great trait. I love the part where he looks like he's going to surrender his gun when the main antagonist has a hostage. But then Eastwood swings the gun up and blows a hole through the villain's shoulder with only a fraction of a second to aim.It's an incredibly memorable movie just as Eastwood's famous speech:\"I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all of this excitement, I kind of lost track of that myself. But being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do you, punk?\"",

            "content": "Detective Harry Callahan is a San Francisco cop known as Dirty Harry. There are multiple reasons offered as to how he got the name; they all could be true and none of them could be true. He's an uber-macho cop that hates everyone (especially \"spicks\" as he said) and packs the very useful and practical hand cannon known as a .44 Magnum. You never know when you'll have to kill an elephant in the streets of San Francisco. Honestly, I think him carrying a .44 Magnum as a service weapon is more impractical than Rick Grimes carrying his .357 to kill zombies in The Walking Dead.Dirty Harry is hot on the trail of a sadistic killer calling himself Scorpio. Harry's tactics, as you can imagine, are a tad beyond the law. Laws!? We don't need no stinkin' laws! They just get in the way of good police work. Laws were made as loopholes to protect bad guys; you know: Escobedo, Miranda, 4th Amendment, 5th Amendment, and the rest. All of them just get in the way of shooting up bad guys. Sure, some mistakes will be made, some innocent people may get killed, some property may be damaged but it's all worth it in the end.Excuse that tangent I went off on... we were talking about Scorpio right? Yes. Scorpio is a sick puppy that's randomly killing people in San Francisco. Inspector Harry is tracking him to put him in jail or kill him and not necessarily in that order. He finds himself a bit hogtied by the liberal San Francisco application of the laws of the United States. If he could just be left to handle things his way then Scorpio would be vanquished, defeated, erased from existence.You may sense a little sarcasm in my review. That's because there is sarcasm. The movie makes the issue of hunting down Scorpio very black and white when most criminal issues are not. In this case it's A.) take the reins off to allow a \"good cop\" to get the justice required or B.) keep them on and allow a killer to keep on killing. Can that happen? Yes. Does it happen? Yes. But is that a reason to skirt around the laws in place to protect every U.S. citizen? No. I may be politicizing a plain ol' cop movie but it's hard for me not to while knowing Eastwood's political leanings and seeing how the movie unfolded. As a plain ol' cop movie this was great. As a movie with implications beyond the silver screen it didn't sit entirely well with me.",

Is it something that resonates with us on a deeper level? Whatever it is, I feel Dirty Harry (1971) is certainly an iconic film. Let's take a look at why this is the case.First off, there's the famous monologue about counting. \"Do you feel lucky?\" completes a tense moment that merely started with a detective's intuition that something was about to go down. But what make this early scene that much greater is the bookend it creates with the film's antagonist, Scorpio (Andy Robinson). This isn't even the only bookend this film has to offer, as the two deaths at either end of the movie end up being submerged in water. Secondly, while the 1970's seem quite different to our modern styles, something about the culture of the time (especially in San Francisco) really works to offset the \"dirty\" detective who will do whatever it takes to get his man, even if it means breaking the rules.Finally, the whole \"cat and mouse\" between Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and Scorpio really drives the film. Sure, there are a few moments interspersed where we see that Harry is still a good cop who cares for the people of San Francisco, despite his harsh exterior, but the game Scorpio has Detective Callahan play (the most intense of which involves getting from one phone booth to another in a limited amount of time) ratchets up the intensity with each \"move\" they make. Overall, these two characters really make Dirty Harry the fantastic film it is.A great movie that utilizes all of Clint Eastwood's squinty-eyed, teeth-gritting performance, I give Dirty Harry 5.0 stars out of 5.",

Watching it again it is hard to believe that this film is almost forty years old it is as gritty and thrilling as it ever was.When the city of San Francisco is being held hostage by a sniper Inspector Harry Callahan is put in the case. We learn that he is clearly a no nonsense police officer early on when he prevents a group of bank robbers from escaping; dispatching most of them with his trademark Smith and Wesson .44 Magnum. Along with his new partner Harry positions himself on a rooftop waiting for the sniper to make his move unfortunately he escapes a in a change of modus operandi he kidnaps a fourteen year old girl and announces that he has buried her with limited oxygen and if the city doesn't give him $200,000 dollars he will let her die. Harry is given the task of delivering the cash but when he gets there the killer attacks him and announces that he will let her die anyway. Lucky not to be killed Harry follows a lead that takes him to where the killer lives here he catches the killer and forces him to say where the girl is, unfortunately the killer can't be changed due to Harry's unconventional and illegal methods. This leads to him hijacking a school bus and confronting Harry once more.This is one of the great cop movies; the plot isn't overly convoluted, the action isn't over the top... no exploding helicopters and it isn't full of one liners we frequently get in such films these days. Clint Eastwood is great in the title role, a part he was born to play and Andrew Robinson does well as his psychotic nemesis, I was amazed to read here that it was his first film role.This film is a must see for any fan of cop films or of Clint Eastwood. It has been said that the lack of political correctness dates this film although it was criticised for being illiberal when it was released and there is little difference between Harry torturing a murder suspect in this and Jack Bauer torturing a terrorist suspect in 24, not that I would advocate such behaviour outside the world of fiction.",

Harry is not too happy, but goes along with the choice that was made for him.The mad sniper, Scorpio, has been shooting people from rooftops all over the city. Harry and Chico are sent to deal with this mad person. Harry gets lucky when the criminal makes the mistake of kidnapping a young girl, after his demands for two hundred thousand dollars is not met. Harry chases him into a football field and shoots from a distance, wounding the man. Harry, who is clearly upset, pokes at the man's injured man, but Scorpio warns Harry that even criminals have rights and wants to be treated as a law abiding citizen.Harry finds out in the worst way the D.A., William Rothko, decides to set free Scorpio because according to what he learned about the case, Harry violated a number of laws that protect the criminals, the same way that in his estimation decent folks deserve them. Scorpio does everything in his power, even paying another scum bag, to beat him to a pulp, and accuses Harry of doing it.The last thing Scorpio does is to kidnap a bus carrying some suburban children as they return home. Harry, who is asked to go after Scorpio, has another thing in mind. Knowing what route the man is taking, he bides his time to trap the evil man in a finale that shows no mercy for the man that had no scruples in harming indiscriminately.Don Siegel was the director of \"Dirty Harry\", and as he had proved with the earlier \"Coogan's Bluff\", he knew he had a sure winner in this action film that reunited him with Clint Eastwood. Mr. Siegel was a man that understood the genre, as he shows here. Working with the screenplay by Harry Julian and Rita Fink, the action moves to San Francisco, which lends itself to be the backdrop of this rapid paced crime story.Clint Eastwood played Harry Callahan with his usual style. His Harry was a man of action, not given to say much about himself. Reni Santoni is his partner, Chico Gonzalez. Andrew Robinson is Scorpio, the criminal that underestimates Harry's resolution in getting him to justice and has to pay a high price for it. The supporting cast included Harry Guardino, John Vernon, Josef Sommers, and John Larch, among others.Carl Pingitore's editing adds to the enjoyment of the picture. So does the jazzy score by Lalo Schiffrin, a composer of many successful films and television series. Bruce Surtees camera work shows splendid views of scenic San Francisco the way it looked in those years.Ultimately this was the Don Siegel-Clint Eastwood show that teamed up to bring a fast paced entertainment that looks as good today, as when it was shot.",

            "content": "I'm not sure if I was expecting more or what, this film was alright. Maybe the slow-yet-fast/consistent pacing and filmmaking had to do with that, not in the sense of that being a bad thing: but rather in the sense that, what was happening, didn't necessarily make up for it.Take Nicolas Winding Refn's Too Old to Die Young for example. That's the only work of his I've seen so far, besides Bronson. And I don't remember much about its filmmaking. But I'm aware he's done his thing similarly before. That show/long film seemed to almost rely on these super long shots: and the camerawork; it seemed to express passion for one's craft. His style seems to be divisive: a lot of people hated that in the show, from what I've seen, in some of his films, too. I can understand that, but I liked it, possibly because the narrative was captivating.In this film, that style could've been an aspect more negative than positive. At the same time, the story/narrative didn't seem all that captivating to me. That likely made the directing style stand out more which, in turn, affected the already-lacking captivation in a domino effect. If you're to go that route, the story should carry its weight, or that route will probably have the opposite effect.The best aspects of this film were undoubtedly the directing, camerawork, the cinematography, and to a lesser extent, the soundtrack. At first, the soundtrack was alright; different. But upon some reflection, I concluded that 'different' is good, and it was eerie and all that, fitting each instance. The other aspects were the cream of the crop, though.I liked that ironic scene with the monologue. The way Clint Eastwood did that scene, said that monologue, and his smirk at the end, were great, and how it came full circle at the end. The first time was so smooth and chill, which added to it tremendously. It's no wonder that moment became a classic. It's very memorable. I'd say that, and how it came full circle, was the best part of the film.Performance-wise, it seems like people have commended Clint Eastwood. It didn't stand out to me. Neither did most of the performances, but not in a 'these performances are bad' way. But Andrew Robinson's performance was slightly notable, I suppose. Besides him, nobody's performances stood out like a sore thumb, in a good or bad way. They were all acceptable.(Upon further reflection, Clint Eastwood's performance was pretty good. I don't know what I was thinking.)One thing about the ending that stood out to me was the lack of a score. I'm not too sure how I feel about that. It was a change of pace from the usual; I guess that's good in and of itself. Not only that, it acted as a way to set that feeling of seriousness to what was happening. Yet, I don't know: something was lacking. That way of doing things should be utilized more, for sure. It just didn't seem to be cut out for this film.All-in-all, I'm pleased with this film. It was an alluring watch due to the elements I've mentioned. It could've been more entertaining, but that's not a big deal. It's a good thing that I got lucky seeing this film on Youtube off to the side as I was watching another video. That's the reason why I ended up watching it. Who knows how far down the road it would've taken had that not happened. It'll probably be a while until I watch the next film in the series.Other thoughts:The woman at the beginning sort of looked like Maggie Lawson.\"Yeah, well, when an adult male is chasing a female with intent to commit (the R word), I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.\" vs. \"When I see five weirdos dressed in togas stabbing a guy in a park, I shoot the bastards. That's my policy.\" in The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! I'm guessing inspiration for that line came from this film.I was shocked that this film wasn't a one-off but rather the first film out of a film series. Not even a trilogy: a series. I did not know that. At all. I think that was a mildly good thing, though. If I had known, I probably wouldn't have watched it yet. Film trilogies and film series make me feel obligated to watch all of them in a row.",

This view of Scorpio is also helped by the eerie music which accompanies his scenes.This is a great movie and deserves it status as a classic  10/10",

In addition to the new assignment, Inspector Callahan has also been given a new partner named \"Chico\" (Reni Santoni) who he is tasked with training as well. And if that wasn't bad enough it appears that management within the police department has adopted a new approach which frowns upon \"Dirty Harry's\" brutal--but effective--tactics. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a good movie when it first came out over 45 years ago and it remains very entertaining even today. That being said, for those viewers who might enjoy a movie of this type then I heartedly recommend it and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",

Insp. 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is the San Francisco cop who has little respect for almost anyone, and uses unorthodox methods to get the job done, mostly homicide cases. The city is being terrorised by a psychopathic sniper known as Scorpio (Hellraiser's Andrew Robinson), and Harry is assigned to the case, along with new rookie partner Insp. Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni) to investigate this madman's murders and track him down. Scorpio is asking for $100,000 from the city, i.e. The Mayor (John Vernon) otherwise he'll kill again. Eventually they agree to pay Scorpio, and Harry volunteers to make the drop off, but ends up running from phone to phone when the killer gives him numerous ones to go to. Harry did manage to stick a knife in the killer's leg, so they know who they are looking for, but when Harry catches him, they have no evidence to convict him. After trying to get Harry in trouble hiring someone to beat him up saying it was him, Scorpio eventually resorts to kidnapping a bus load of kids and the Bus Driver (Ruth Kobart) demanding payment, and Harry is determined to stop him once and for all. Also starring Harry Guardino as Lt. Al Bressler, John Larch as The Chief, John Mitchum as Insp. Frank DiGiorgio, Mae Mercer as Mrs. Russell, Lyn Edgington as Norma, Woodrow Parfrey as Mr. Jaffe, Josef Sommer as Dist. Atty. William T. Rothko, William Paterson as Judge Bannerman, James Nolan as Liquor Store Owner, Maurice S. Argent as Sid Kleinman, Jo De Winter as Miss Willis and Craig G. Kelly as Sgt. Reineke. This is probably the most well known and finest of all Eastwood's performances, Robinson is also brilliant as the gibbering psycho, Siegel directs this film very stylishly to make all action scenes very exciting along with great use of the Golden Gate locations, a must-see crime thriller.

            "content": "In essence this is being a very typical detective story, in which a tough cop has to stop a killer. \"Dirty Harry\" is of course a far from typical movie though. There are several things about it that makes this movie more special- and unlike any other genre attempt.The first reason is also the most obvious one; its main character. Clint Eastwood plays a classic character, in the same vein as for instance a Steve McQueen- or Charles Bronson, in his best days, type of character. A tough looking guy, who backs down for nobody or anything and with an high sense for justice and righteousness. A good guy acting and thinking as a bad guy. Really, these type of characters often have more bad guy characteristics to them but yet they still work out really well as good guys, since they 'fight' for the right causes and are on the good side, even though they quite often break the law.It's all very consistent with the raw and gritty style of the movie, courtesy of director Don Siegel. It's the sort of movie that feels realistic and is not just purely made to entertain. It has very little exaggerated moments in the sense of moments that feel like they couldn't ever happen in real life.You could say that it's also being a slow moving- and not all that spectacular movie because of that but I would mostly disagree. It's fast paced with also plenty of excitement and action in it. Of course when compared to modern genre movies it's nothing too spectacular but it definitely has other qualities to it. It's rawness being one of them, which makes this a very straightforward and effective movie within its genre.There really aren't too many distractions in this movie. It focuses just on the Dirty Harry character and all he is concerned about is getting the bad guy. So no other drama, no distracting love story, or other sentimental ploys. The movie is what it is and it doesn't ever pretend to be more than it truly is.And the story as it is, is just fine. It has plenty of depth and good developments in it, all driven by a good and interesting crime story. It's not really being predictable in any way, which is also mainly due to its villainous character, played by Andrew Robinson. He's a very unpredictable and psychotic character, that no one is safe for. Not every plot development is convincing but it helps to let the story move along and to keep things fresh and interesting.A great, gritty, cop movie, even still in today's perspective.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Dirty Harry Callahan wages a battle against a murderous and brutal hippie-like all-around scumbag who menaces the general public.Yes, both movies are period pieces. \"Billy Jack\" was meant to show the peaceful hippies being helpless against redneck bullies. \"Dirty Harry\" shows that the counterculture was no benign force, with drug use, sexual diseases and unwanted pregnancies, and violent crime including terrorism rising sharply by the 1970's. The police forces were viewed as helpless, and the movie depicts this view, with Dirty Harry as the hero who fights back against all the evils. Yes, the characters are one-dimensional and the story is trite, but the movie effectively conveys the message it intends to.",

The storyline follows a serial killer in San Francisco that's kidnaps people, demands a ransom and kills them anyway even after getting paid. A police officer decides it's time to play outside the rules to bring down the killer. This movie is directed by Don Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and stars Clint Eastwood (Pale Rider), John Vernon (Killer Klowns from Outer Space), Andrew Robinson (Hellraiser), Harry Guardino (The Enforcer) and Reni Santoni (Cobra). The storyline for this picture hasn't aged well - cops taking Justice into their own hands and killing criminals they feel deserve it. I remember loving this film as a kid and cringing most of the movie now. Eastwood is excellent as the main character, though it's funny he doesn't know the laws and is corrected about his interpretations of them throughout the movie. His intensity and demeanor sets the tone for the movie and his \"do you feel lucky punk\" line is legendary. The mayor being so soft was kind of funny. The soundtrack for this is very good as is the villain and closing scene. This is a bit of an uneven action movie that has some redeeming elements. I'd score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend seeing it.",

Harry pays him the ransom money, but later tracks him down and arrests him after a memorable showdown in a football stadium.

I had forgotten what a clich\u00e9-riddled piece of garbage this movie really is. It is an insult to the intelligence, and there simply is no way that any half-intelligent human being could appreciate this movie. The crucial point in the story line is when the prosecuting attorney lectures Harry for having violated the murderous creep's civil rights. Because none of the evidence is deemed admissible in court, they have to release the creep, and it is all Harry's fault. This is all preposterous. There is no semblance to reality, although I am sure that many people do not understand this and believe that creeps are routinely allowed to walk free by sentimental liberals. This movie may in fact have a lot to do with the misinformed belief that many people have, that liberal judges and lawyers are always letting creeps walk free.This movie is pathetically bad.

However, I couldn't really recall the storyline in \"Dirty Harry\", though I remembered Clint Eastwood being a touch police man in the movie. So as I had the opportunity to return to visit \"Dirty Harry\" again here in 2022, of course I jumped at the chance.Writers Harry Julian Fink, Rita M. Fink, Dean Riesner, Terrence Malick, Jo Heims and John Milius actually managed to put together a very macho police story here, and it is something that felt like it was tailored specifically for Clint Eastwood.I found the storyline to be good and enjoyable. It was a story that latch on to you from the very beginning and director Don Siegel takes you on an action and adrenaline-packed chase of cat and mouse, as detective Harry Callahan is chasing after a killer that is making the streets of San Francisco unsafe.There is a good amount of action and straight up tough guy police man elements in \"Dirty Harry\", and that is what makes this a good movie, and makes it an archetypical Clint Eastwood movie in its own right.They had put together a good cast ensemble for this 1971 movie with Clint Eastwood in the lead, and doing a great job carrying the movie and bringing the rough and tough Harry to life on the screen. He is joined by the likes of John Vernon, Reni Santoni, Harry Guardino and Andrew Robinson.\"Dirty Harry\" is an enjoyable movie, and definitely is a good addition to Clint Eastwood's acting career. And it is also the movie that brought the iconic and highly quotable \"Do I feel luck? Well, do ya, punk?\"My rating of \"Dirty Harry\" lands on a six out of ten stars.",

The film itself is just as concerned with its slower moments as it is with its moments of action, building a suspenseful story that explodes with the sort of violence that actually matters. It's essentially a commentary on the justice system and, whether or not you agree with its wider politics, it does a great job of getting you on its side. Ultimately, there's a real, slightly revisionist grit underlying a narrative that's got something to say and isn't afraid to say it. 8/10",

Not perfect, not quite Oscar quality, but still, a combination of terrific acting by Eastwood, Robinson, and the supporting cast, use of cinematography and music (excellent by 70's standards), and a suspenseful story line make this a movie to remember.My take on two matters in this film differs from most commentators: 1)Harry is really not so bad -- he just \"plays\" bad. His racism, quiet, and anger is largely put on to intimidate. Yes, he was scarred by his wife's death, but he obviously develops affection for Gonzalez, and is decent to Gonzalez's wife. The only people he really hates are the bad guys.2) This film was produced by Clint Eastwood's own Malpaso Company. Although his only credit is the lead, his imprint is all over this (and other Malpaso films). Eastwood is a politically active (former Mayor of Carmel) conservative, long-time resident of Northern California, and this film is a polemic against weak-kneed politicians that want to give in to or negotiate with terrorists, and certain excesses of our system of rights, particularly the exclusionary rule (why can't we admit the evidence, as long as \"chain of evidence\" is unbroken, and discipline the police officers who broke the rules / violated rights, like in the UK?). The real message is that the system should be organized to protect victims, not criminals, so that ordinary police work can put the bad guys away. In such a world, Harry would not exist.I imagine that people who have a problem with his view of \"law and order\" politics would not enjoy this film at all, but it is beautifully done all the same.",

Who else better to pull this off than Clint Eastwood who is flawless and effortless in portraying the role.Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is a trigger happy unconventional cop but always brings results. When the city is threatened by a sniper aka Scorpio Killer (Andrew Robinson) who keeps putting down random victims holds the city police for ransom to stop his rampage. Harry is assigned for the task and they come up with a plan. The sniper gives them a slip after repeated plans lure him to their cage. This time the Scorpio killer takes it personal and asks Harry to deliver the ransom for a final showdown.Follows a textbook story telling process which later becomes a formula for the genre. A detailed introduction of the antagonist followed by the protagonist only after which the plot surfaces (as wafer thin as it might be) slowly building up to a final showdown. Though the Scorpio killer initially comes off as weak and mad, his character progresses steadily during the course of the story giving multiple dimensions and levels to his character. It is not comprehensible how the police department misses the sniper even multiple sightings with all the man power, pre-planning and technology. But the star is undoubtedly Clint Eastwood who carries the entire weight of the movie and even gives it a considerable boost with an uninterested look on his face, the hype surrounding him because of his volatile trigger happy nature and sharp one-liners.Simple yet captivating screenplay allows Clint Eastwood to drive the star vehicle",

            "content": "It's somewhat ironic that Clint Eastwood would become a household name by playing \"the man with no name\" before transitioning away from Westerns into contemporary movies, and then the movie that made him a superstar for the second time was a larger than life character than be identified first as a classic archetype and cinema icon and as a Eastwood role second.Everybody knows Dirty Harry. The attitude, the scowl, and the one-liners have been mimicked and parodied so many times, and the original movie, and it's sequels, have spawned countless new generations of similar hardcore heroes. Without Harry Callaghan there would be no John Matrix, no Cobra, no John McClane, no Martin Riggs, etc. Is the original film itself any good? Well, it's certainly controversial, even in the present day. Though much of the film's politics seem to be projected into the movie by its audience than actually part of film itself. In reality it's a very straight-forward, laid-back affair with minimalist dialogue, editing, and a subdued style.There's not much in the way of plot, and there's very little detective work or puzzle solving on Harry's part. He's just a blunt tool used for a dirty job, hence the name. For a movie that barely nudges past the 100-minute mark it does feel a lot long, with lingering shots, huge chunks of purely visual storytelling, and a few detours that feel like padding. The central story of a crazed sniper offing random civilians in San Francisco, inspired by the real life Zodiac murder case, isn't strong enough to last the already thin running time.It is a movie that is about style over substance, and for its day it was very slick and high key with gorgeous anamorphic Panavision photography. Does it hold up? Just about. It's not a movie that I watch for the entertainment value, but merely to study how certain classics were made.",

This really is a perfect film. Direction: Perfect. Script: Perfect. Acting: Perfect. No really, the acting is perfect. I'm the first to admit that Clint ain't the greatest actor on the planet, but I'm sure he knows that himself. I mean, it's not like he goes around trying to play Hamlet is it? So I reckon that the acting in this film is perfect because Clint was perfect casting in the role and he does no more and no less than the role requires. As Harry himself says in the sequel: \"A man's gotta know his limitations...\" And I think that's exactly what Eastwood himself knows. Plus the film says more about America in the 70's than tons of the films. Possibly more about American in the 2000's than anything being made today.

And let me just clarify, I wholeheartedly recommend you see this movie; it definitely deserves a watch. It is a solid, interesting, DISPOSABLE thriller. But that is it's big flaw. It is just disposable. Obviously, there are some memorable and amazing moments but the plot drags it down for me.Expanding on that point, I love the concept of some serial killer manipulating a city into giving him money but I think the film throws too many 'twists and turns' to make it seem more intelligent than it is. I'd rather they stick with the, possibly clich\u00e9, story of Dirty Harry hunting down Scorpio, rather than try to make the plot more complicated. Probably just my personal preference but I still consider it some form of flaw. As a whole, it is very enjoyable but it just isn't that well structured or written.Another thing I wasn't a fan of was the climax. With the exception of some truly badass moments and scenes, it just felt rushed as a whole. The location is different and interesting but the way they UTILISE it wasn't. I didn't want a huge giant climax featuring tanks, fire and the Death Star(Yeah I know Star Wars wasn't released yet) because action wasn't the focus and I understand that. I just would have rather they either changed the premise of the climax entirely, or put a little more effort in. I do love the final minute or two, however.Clint Eastwood was amazing as Dirty Harry and I think this is his most iconic role. He really owns the character and knows the perfect mix of being likable and loathsome, to make a tough guy cop. Harry is a very interesting and well written protagonist. I am very happy his past was left in his past because that gives him a level of mystery and intrigue, which I hope isn't spoiled in the sequels when I watch them.Andrew Robinson is great as the eerily insane an terrifying Scorpio. Scorpio was genuinely threatening and scary. He was a classic loathsome villain, with no levels of likability or charisma. He was just classically bad and I really like that.Reni Santoni was passable as Chico Gonzalez. Gonzalez was just a bland and boring character. He had no qualities to make him interesting . Him and Callahan had NO chemistry and I really don't understand why he was even in the movie.The cinematography and editing was pretty solid for the most. It looked fine. I do have some issues with the lighting, however. It got too dark for me at points and it was pretty hard to see. The costume design was perfectly passable.This movie contains one of the greatest one liners in cinema history. I wont write it here because it will take too long but you need to see the movie just to see this line put to good use. As stated prior, this movie is a perfectly disposable thriller. I do recommend you watch it, however. I'll rate this film 6 'LUCKY PUNKS' out of 10.",

Dirty Harry believes in good, old-fashioned frontier justice (which didn't always jibe with the law as laid out by them as lays out laws). He also happens to be absolutely right in taking the law into his own hands: the system proves ineffectual against the likes of Scorpio, who manages to manipulate both the law and the media to his own nefarious ends. (One can only be thankful that John Wayne turned down the part: if ever an actor was more closely associated with the party line than Wayne, I never heard of him, and DIRTY HARRY cried out for- if you will- a maverick leading man. Clint Eastwood was the perfect choice, having made his reputation in Italian Westerns.) Director Don Siegel, one of the most talented filmmakers to ever come down the pike, reached his peak with this one. And that's saying a lot.",

It features Clint Eastwood in the eponymous role, trying to chase down a psychotic killer played brilliantly by Andrew \"Garak of Deep Space 9\" Robinson.The plot is fairly simple. Harry stop Scorpio (the killer). In between Harry gets to foil a few other crimes - my favourite being the hilarious scene where Harry talks down a man from committing suicide. This is a prime example of some the delicious black humour running through \"Dirty Harry\", that helps elevate it above the dross. The main killer is particularly effective because of the way Robinson portrays him, as if a wild man is trapped inside a normal citizen. The killings themselves are violent and brutal and perfectly match the film's gritty nature.Eastwood suits the dry, sarcastic, down-beat Harry to a tee as he's perfected all the looks necessary over his career. He's a cop you don't ever want to mess with. His partner - who have previously had the career of a Spinal Tap drummer - plays surprisingly well off him, considering the circumstances, even if his fate is somewhat inevitable.I'd recommend \"Dirty Harry\" to any fans of the cop genre, as Dirty Harry - the cop, not the movie - is a great character.

San Francisco is a marvelous backdrop but, aside from long views of the Golden Gate Bridge, not exploited nearly as effectively as it could have been.

            "content": "Though there were several actors interested in the role, we can all be thankful that it was a 41 year-old Clint Eastwood that ultimately landed the role and film history was made.In this first (and best) installment of the series, we have Inspector Harry Callahan of the San Francisco PD on the trail of Scorpio, a sadistic serial-killer, whose attempting to extort the city of $100,000 - but the sum soon rises as do the stakes. The role of Scorpio is brilliantly portrayed by the little-known/under-rated actor Andy Robinson, who, after this movie should have gone on to do great things, but instead, he was soon cast for a role in a soap opera pathetically enough; of which he was soon fired from merely because \"he's that mean man, from that scary movie\". Knowing this, one can easily surmise that the soap opera crowd must be some of the softest and most delicate people in the world. Anyway back to the movie, Eastwood's good friend and mentor, veteran film director Don Siegel helmed the project, which was filmed in and around Clint's home town of San Francisco, the primary location for all but one (Sudden Impact) of the series.Owing much to the fact that Scorpio's a homicidally insane night-owl, who has a very busy night-life, many of the movies most crucial scenes occur at night, which were strikingly captured by the masterful eye of veteran cinematographer Bruce Sortees. The scene on the roof-tops involving the attempt on the catholic priests life, where Scorpio gleefully shoots-up the rotating \"Jesus Saves\" sign is the most perfectly composed/photographed night scene I've ever seen in a movie, another great one is the scene involving the labyrinthine layers of Kezar stadium (which dramatically ends with one of the best helicopter shots ever). Scorpio as you'll see, is a man whose not burdened by a conscience and leaves a trail of destruction virtually everywhere he goes and though he's highly impulsive, he's not stupid and ropes along Callahan, The Mayor and the SFPD for almost the entire movie, first with extortion attempts, then he tries his hand at blackmail - and more extortion.When watching this first outing of Dirty Harry one quickly realizes just how perfectly suited the cast and crew were, it's a marvel, a thing of sheer perfection and as a result of their combined talents, every single aspect of this film seems to fall perfectly into place and crystallizes at that moment, resulting in the creation of an iconic screen hero/film series. Though four more \"Dirties\" would follow, the first film still stands out as the best of the lot; but what are the reasons behind that, as there are so many to consider. First of all Eastwood's great as always - that's a given. However for me it's the thrillingly compelling performance of Andy Robinson, that elevates this film to the next level and the series never had a more effective antagonist. Huge props must also be given to Don Siegel, whose skillful direction fully compliments the film and keeps the pace rolling at a high level of intrigue. Siegel's direction is so to the point that there's not a single scene wasted, not even a single wasted frame.Another stalwart of the series is composer extraordinaire Lalo Schifrin (the man behind the Mission Impossible theme), who scored all but one of the series five films. But it's in this film that his music is most memorable and effective, Schifrin's music has a way of capturing the vibe of Scorpio's murky, night-time world, pitch perfectly. I'm particularly found of the tension his music stirs up whenever Scorpio is coldly eyeing his victim from a distance. Schrifin was, again, the perfect choice of composer, which as stated earlier is a recurring fact, when considering the people who where behind this classic film. Which finally brings us to George Milius, the films screen-writer, whose contributions are invaluable to this films lasting greatness. Milius is primarily remembered for his iconic \"Do I feel lucky\" routine, which Harry loves to taunt criminals with; his famous words are, of course, reinforced by the presence of his infamous partner - the mighty Smith & Wesson 44 magnum revolver.What this all adds up to is the best cop drama ever made and it's scary to think of how badly this movie would have sucked, with someone else in Clint's signature role. Give praise to the exploits of Inspector Callahan, as this series has been an institution of greatness for nearly the past half a century.",

The only aim the director had was entertain the viewers while producing the film, a job Don Siegel has fairly successfully done. Film wholly revolves around Clint Eastwood and it is his charisma that has kept dirty harry standing; Perhaps imagining someone other than Eastwood in the role of harry and gaining this amount of popularity for the film is completely vain. The biggest drawback to this movie is the villain pole of story(Scorpio). A character which hasn't been developed properly. It is very weak character. Opposing someone with this level of intelligence and ability (just compare Scorpio's intelligence and ability with zodiac's, it is said Scorpio's character inspired by his character and actions) for ransom (100000$ or 200000$) with the heads of a big city is eccentric and idiotic. The script does not provide any information about the biography and features of this character. The amount of information Which is scheduled to be presented about this serial killer,played by a weak actor for this role (Andrew Robinson) in this job is powerless and unsuccessful. To me it is strange why a professional director like don Siegel has used such an inept actor for villain role of his film. Perhaps if both the character and acting the villain role had been effective a better balance between positive and negative poles of the story would have been created and we would have a better movie.

            "review_title": "\"Dirty Harry\" - Still the dirtiest 37 years later",
            "content": "Landmark cinema doesn't get any \"dirtier\" than the legendary \"Dirty Harry,\" the titular character, San Francisco Detective \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan, played with 44. Magnum slyness by none other than star Clint Eastwood. Of course at the time, Eastwood was already a cult figure known for his numerous appearances in dozens of westerns, the most notable of which were the \"spaghetti westerns\" of Sergio Leone. When Frank Sinatra turned down the role due to an old injury, it was then offered to Eastwood, and screen legend (and infamy) was born.\"Dirty Harry\" was groundbreaking for its hard violence and \"fascistic-vigilante\" approach to law enforcement. This played hard for liberals and anyone concerned with criminal rights (though the argument could be made that criminals have no rights, but this IS America, right?). As a criminal justice major myself, this puts me in an awkward position: on the one hand, I want to cheer Harry Callahan for breaking the rules to get positive results, but on the other hand we live in America, and we have a responsibility to show to the rest of the world that we're a civilized country, and we treat everyone (yes, even our criminals) fairly.In \"Dirty Harry,\" a sniper, dubbed \"Scorpio\" (Andy Robinson), is terrorizing the Bay area, shooting innocent civilians at random until the city hands him over $200,000. The rule-breaking \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan is put on the case, partnered with Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni), to track down the elusive Scorpio Killer, who was based on the real-life Zodiac Killer (and who was terrorizing the city at the same time the movie was being filmed and was never captured). But political red-tape and suspects'-rights force Harry to earn his namesake, and go beyond the law to capture a dangerous psychopath.Eastwood's close friend and directorial mentor, director Don Siegel, working from a screenplay by Harry Julian Fink & R.M. Fink and Dean Riesner, made excellent use of the San Francisco city-scape to depict a world that was not only on the brink and rife with violent crime and debauchery, but gives the audience a real reason to shun suspects'-rights (the then-recent Miranda case, coercive interrogation techniques, denial of right-to-legal-counsel) and get justice by any means necessary. So you get why \"Dirty Harry,\" which was released during a time of great change in Hollywood, when filmmakers were taking a stab (no pun intended) at left-wing Hollywood morality and was telling the liberal politics to take a hike, was so revolutionary. (It was released the same year as \"A Clockwork Orange\" and \"Straw Dogs.\")Controversy aside, \"Dirty Harry\" is one of the best action films ever made, certainly one of the most action-packed thrillers of the genre. Eastwood became a legend, with his 44. Magnum in hand and his most-quotable \"Do you feel lucky, punk?\" line. Not to be overlooked, also, is the contribution of Andy Robinson as Scorpio, who is often cited as one of the great (if not the greatest) movie villains.For a hero so good at breaking the rules, now we know why we call him \"Dirty\" Harry.10/10",

But, Clint Eastwood and Andy Robinson are excellent in their respective roles.I'm a sucker for anything that's been filmed in San Francisco (always a picturesque backdrop)and Lalo Schifrin's music is so evocative of the era. Eastwood was never better than he was in this picture as the thoroughly unlikeable maverick cop Harry Callaghan who believes that justice should be dispensed instantly and decisively right on the streets without the formality of a court case.Robinson also did a sterling job as \"Scorpio\", the psychotic sniper who terrorizes the 'City by the Bay' from the top of downtown buildings. Although there are moments when Callaghan's capacity for cruelty makes Scorpio look like a rank amateur.For my money, it's still one of Eastwood's best performances. Clint will never be remembered for having one of the most animated personalities in the history of Hollywood. But when it came to delivering his own, unique brand of cynical and ultra cool vindictiveness he rarely failed to come through.",

However, there is no doubt in my mind Clint Eastwood was THE MAN to play this. Coming off an experimental part in his career (where he made some of excellent movies like The Beguiled and Play Misty For Me) this cements Clint's place as top action star of his day. Director Don Siegel and Clint Eastwood have worked well together for a while now and are the perfect actor/director team for this project (in my opinion). Don and Clint took elements of Clint's westerns and made it work in a gritty, modern setting. Clint's iconic screen presence and cynical sense of humor makes for one tough cop. Dirty Harry has his match with sadistic serial killer Scorpio. Scorpio is played very clever and with diabolical glee by actor Andy Robinson. Dirty Harry was a huge hit in it's day. But, not everyone loved it. Some thought the film was fascist and questions some of the methods Dirty Harry would employ to bring in the suspect. That's open to interpretation, but the quality of filmaking and performances are undisputed. This would pretty much change the action genre and create a franchise of 4 more films. Dirty Harry is by far the best, but is followed up with the also quite excellent Magnum Force.",

Let's be honest, we all know that this kind of cop doesn't exist in real life and even if he existed he wouldn't get a badge or loose it the first day he's on the streets. Dirty Harry walks around with a gun the size of a small canon, he shoots without hesitation and he doesn't mind to cross the line and yet his superiors don't fire him.No, this isn't the kind of movie that deserves an Oscar. Not for the direction (a lot of the time you don't even see what's happening and the killer's identity is shown much too soon), not for the acting (it's too stereotypical), not for anything... Only the story is OK: there is a killer roaming the streets of San Fransisco. He blackmails the mayor, telling him that he'll shoot some people if he doesn't give him 100,000 dollar. It ends in a cat-and-mouse game between Dirty Harry and the 'Punk'.I guess this is a movie that will be loved by the fans of Schwarzenegger or Stalone, and probably also by the members and sympathizers of the NRA and all other weapon freaks who think they should be allowed to carry guns and shoot anybody without asking questions when they feel \"threatened\". But I'm not a fan of this genre and I don't like movements like the NRA. That's why I gave it a 5/10 (only because of the story).",

            "review_title": "The Epitome of Cinematic Bad-Assery",
            "content": "Gritty, violent, and politically incorrect as hell, Don Siegel's \"Dirty Harry\" of 1971 is doubtlessly one of the chosen few films that influenced and defined the greatest and grittiest cinematic decade of the 70s most, and positively the most essential Cop-flick ever made. It is also one of the essential films in the career of one of cinema's all-time greats, Clint Eastwood, who had already epitomized coolness many times before, most memorably in Sergio Leone's brilliant Dollar-Trilogy, which culminated in the immortal masterpiece \"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\" (\"Il Buono, Il Brutto Il Cattivo\", 1966), positively the greatest Western ever made. Along with the Dollar films, \"Dirty Harry\" is doubtlessly the most memorable among the many great films that Eastwood has been part of. When it was the Dollar films that basically created the Western anti-hero, it was \"Dirty Harry\" that created the character of the unorthodox and supremely bad-ass Cop with the eponymous Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan.Dressed in cool suits and wearing a hip hairstyle, San Francisco homicide detective Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan is the archetype of the tough and unorthodox Cop that has been copied many times, but never quite reached. Callahan hates criminals as much as he hates crime, and he is never afraid to stop crime with his huge 44. Magnum, the 'most powerful handgun in the world' which he assures whimpering thugs would 'blow your head clean off'. It is not imaginable for anyone but Clint Eastwood to play this role. Several other actors (Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen and John Wayne) were considered for the role before it went to Eastwood, but there is no doubt that the role seems as if it was written specifically for Eastwood. Every hero needs a villain, and this villain is terrifically brought to life by Andrew Robinson as the 'Scorpio Killer'. Robinson is brilliantly evil in his role. Sadly, Robinson did not get many other highly memorable roles, except for this film and Clive Barker's Horror masterpiece \"Hellraiser\" of 1987. Scorpio is based on the uncaught Zodiac-Killer who terrorized real-life San Francisco in the late sixties. This film's Scorpio is an megalomaniac, often pathetic but even way more sardonic and deranged psycho who shoots random people in order to blackmail the city. If the city refuses to pay him, he will continue to kill people. When released in 1971, \"Dirty Harry\" caused outrage among critics because of its incredible political incorrectness and violent content. Fact is that the film is incredibly politically incorrect, and the political incorrectness is one of the factors that make it so awesome. Luckily enough, the fact that the unorthodox copper who isn't afraid of bending the law in order to stop criminals was an anathema to faint-hearted critics didn't stop exactly that type of character from becoming one of the most popular roles in bad-ass cult cinema of the 70s. The film is stunningly paced and profits from a brilliant cinematography and a great score. The opening sequence alone is a masterwork of cinematographic ingenuity. Calling \"Dirty Harry\" a trend-setter would be an understatement. Apart from four sequels, the film spawned countless rip-offs, including many awesome Italian films, and it has continued to influence Police-flicks and Action/Thrillers in general to this day. However many great Police films there have been made and hopefully will be made in the future, however, no other cinematic cop will ever compare to Clint Eastwood's Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Calahan. This eponymous character alone more than justifies the description 'masterpiece' for this film, which is brilliant on so many levels. The dialogue includes some of the most memorable lines ever in cinema, such as the statement that 'Harry Hates Everybody', or Harry's immortal 'Do You Feel Lucky' monologue. \"Dirty Harry\" simply is the definition of cinematic bad-assery, and, along with Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver\" it is probably THE most defining American film of the 1970s. This is one of the films that can be watched an infinite number of times and only become more awesome. I've personally lost count long ago of how many times I've seen it, and I will certainly watch it many more times to come. All said, this film is an absolute proof for the genius of Don Siegel as a director and Clint Eastwood as a leading man. Without exaggeration, \"Dirty Harry\" is positively one of the most influential and incomparably entertaining films ever made and no one interested in cinema can afford to miss it. 10/10",

Someone has to stop him, and there's only one man dangerous enough for the job - Inspector Harry Callahan ...This is the original and best psycho cop movie, a landmark in action films and crowd-pleasing adult thrillers, a key role for Eastwood (he reprised it four times), an amazing timepiece of west-coast America in the early seventies, and probably the most influential crime thriller ever made. Its importance in Hollywood terms can't be overestimated. Half of the crime movies made since copy it - the idea of the renegade tough guy cop with nothing to lose who's maybe just as crazy as the perps he's chasing simultaneously allows for great action scenes, intriguing characters and social commentary. What makes this film so good is the character of Harry Callahan - he is the hero, but is he really the guy you want protecting you ? He gets the job done when no-one else can, but at what cost ? Unlike so many imitators (Lethal Weapon, Bad Boys, about a zillion others), the movie doesn't give its hero any redeeming qualities - he's just a crime-smashing maniac. The key scene is the one in the football field, which culminates in one of the greatest shots ever done - a stunning helicopter pull-back of Harry grinding his heel in the killer's stab-wound to extract the information he wants, fading into a murky grey as the line between hero and villain is quite literally blurred. Eastwood is about as close to perfect casting as you can get - it's impossible to imagine anyone else playing this role, although ironically the part is nothing like Eastwood the man, and when he played roles closer to home (such as Bronco Billy or Honkytonk Man) his films weren't as popular. There's good support from Guardino and Santoni, and Robinson is fabulously nasty as the evil Scorpio (check him out also in Hellraiser). There's also a great little unbilled bit by Albert Popwell as the unfortunate blagger in the classic \"I gots to know\" bank-robbery scene. This was Siegel and Eastwood's fourth film together and they were obviously in perfect synchronicity as the movie flows together smoothly, buoyed by Lalo Schifrin's wonderfully scritchy jazz-blues music, a classic seventies score. The location photography by Bruce Surtees is just terrific throughout; somehow both documentary realism (back-of-car and street-scene shots) and moody darkness, and a fantastic travelogue of San Fransisco - Golden Gate Park, City Hall, the Mission District, Mount Davidson. A dynamite thriller, and the best film of Siegel's distinguished career (Riot In Cell Block 11, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, The Killers, Escape From Alcatraz). It doesn't matter if you're a paid-up NRA member who idolises Harry, or a queasy liberal who thinks he's the original Fascist Pig, this is the movie to go see together and argue about.

            "content": "\"Dirty Harry\" is one of the iconic movies of the 1970s but it seems to have fallen by the cinematic wayside a bit. Sure, everyone knows it was one of Clint Eastwood's signature roles, about a tough but effective San Francisco cop who asks \"Do you feel lucky, punk?\" but for such a widely known movie, it isn't a cable staple, it's not an essential for DVD libraries. It's one of those movies everyone knows of but not a great many younger viewers actually bother to see. Is it getting a fair rap?The movie has its moments. As the movie starts, Eastwood's Harry Callahan is trying to mind his own business and have a sandwich but is forced to stop a team of bank robbers. This epic scene evokes the image of Eastwood's classic Man with No Name as he walks through the smokey urban canyon, huge gun drawn, fearlessly doing battle against long odds, and coming out with a mere scratch.I think the main problem with the movie is its core plot pitting Harry against a pure-evil maniac serial killer terrorizing San Francisco. The killer is played well enough but it's just so cartoonish a role that it's hard to take the movie too seriously, and considering the gritty, hard message the movie presents, it's a real problem that the villain is a clich\u00e9. The movie's message is that criminals can run rampant because of the 1960s civil rights restrictions to cop's ability torture suspect's for information, or having to get warrants before breaking into suspect's houses, and these sorts of restrictions where why there was so much crime. It's a message that might have had some populist appeal in 1971 but it comes off as pretty kooky 40 years later.Dirty Harry isn't a bad movie, but it's clear that it's dated. It's not as exciting as action movies of the 1980s, there have been much better detective movies, and its message is a tad naive and outdated. It's clear to me why this is a movie everyone has heard of but not a lot of people see anymore. Still, it's worth seeing... but it's not a must-see movie.",

            "content": "\"Dirty Harry\" is one of two Police thrillers that are without equal. The other film being \"The French Connection.\" Both films are that well made in every department, along with being HUGELY influential, that every other American 1970s Cop film was bound to be compared. Putting it simply, you shall not find another movie of this kind that can match them. It is interesting in itself how different a film \"Dirty Harry\" would have been if a different actor had been cast in the leading role of the San Francisco Police Inspector. People like Paul Newman and Burt Lancaster were offered the part but due to their liberal political views, neither man was interested. Apart from anything else, both actors were given different scripts to look over. The closest contender for the Harry Callahan character, was Frank Sinatra. I'm not saying he wouldn't have been any good but the film as a whole would have been completely different. In addition, it is highly doubtful that \"Dirty Harry\" would be enjoying the following that it has had since its release in 1971. Sinatra wouldn't really have been physically imposing enough either. However, he did a good job in the 1968 movie, \"The Detective.\" Thank goodness Clint Eastwood was cast. Who else can say lines like \"Go ahead, make my day\" or \"Do you feel lucky?\" and carry the same kind of impact? Thanks to films like \"Hang 'Em High,\" \"Coogan's Bluff\" and \"The Beguiled,\" Clint Eastwood was on his way to becoming a box office sensation. It was inspired that he and Don Siegel work together for their fourth collaboration. Their previous films were very good on the whole but both men saved their best for \"Dirty Harry.\" Harry Callahan, from his first scene with dialogue, immediately displays his contempt for authority and bureaucracy. This occurs via his complaining about having to wait a long time before the Mayor of San Francisco calls Callahan into his office. The viewers are left in no doubt as to how Callahan functions as a person as well as a Police officer. He doesn't seem to cultivate many friendships or relationships, he hasn't many interests outside of his work and is constantly being reprimanded by his superiors for one reason or another. The latter has been done to death in cinema but back in 1971, that was quite a new thing. Callahan's colleagues don't particularly care for his working methods but still begrudge him some respect for being a tough son of a gun and for producing good results. It is no small wonder that Callahan has had many partners, all of whom either die whilst on active duty or they request a transfer. The opening scene of \"Dirty Harry\" sets the tone for the whole film. Don Siegel cleverly disguises the true appearance of the psychopathic sniper but the killer's presence is certainly felt. The music is somewhat off centre but that only heightens the tension as that woman in the swimming pool falls victim.... Andrew Robinson gives a defining performance as the sniper in question. Apparently, he was spotted by Clint Eastwood during a theatre performance and so, Eastwood put Andrew Robinson's name forward. Harry Guardino, John Larch and John Vernon provide excellent support. They know Callahan's methods only too well, judging by the considerable paperwork they are given each time Callahan uses his signature 44 Magnum. There is plenty of excitement in this film. The scene where Callahan has his lunch interrupted by the bank robbery is terrific as he opens fire on the perpetrators in question. As hard as he is, even Callahan displays a vulnerable side. The section where he secretly liaisons with \"Scorpio\" (Andrew Robinson) in the city park, shows that side to Callahan's character. It is a violent and tense moment of cinema and is very well done. My late father always complained when Callahan uses torture in order to extract either a confession or vital information after a teenage girl is abducted by Scorpio. It is enough that Callahan stabbed the killer in order to defend himself after his brutal assault in the park. It is a bit over the top for Callahan to shoot the injured leg of the killer and to then slowly rotate his foot over the killer's profusely bleeding injury. The scream that Scorpio gives is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. The scene finishes with the camera slowly gliding away as Callahan continues his torture....... The only thing that can be said in Callahan's defence, is that he was very concerned about the girl's safety and location. Does that justify using torture so as to extract information from an unarmed suspect? Only the viewer can decide. Naturally, Callahan was brought to order over his conduct by being given a severe reprimand by the District Attorney. Don Siegel cranks up the tension further with the climax, including a bus full of school children being held hostage by Scorpio. It was bound to come down to a confrontation between Callahan and Scorpio. Their climatic gunfight is brilliant. The ending is slightly steeped in ambiguity. When Callahan throws his Police badge into the pond, did he do that as a sign of his anger and frustration or did he choose to resign? Again, only the viewer can decide. A truly definitive Police thriller and it is worthy of a far higher rating on this website.",

            "content": "Everyone, including Clint Eastwood novices, has heard of Dirty Harry. The famous titular character was established by Eastwood in the 1971 film by Don Siegel. In the film, Harry is a tough-talking cop intent on tracking down a serial killer haunting the streets of SanFrancisco. A mystery that quickly devolved into a cat-and-mouse game with a great '70's score makes up the iconic film.After a string of seemingly unrelated murders, San Francisco police receive communication with the perpetrator who only refers to himself as Scorpio. In the letter, Scorpio demands a ransom to ensure that no more victims are taken and begins to leave notes at each crime scene. Harry (Clint Eastwood) refuses to toe the company line and submit to the demands of a serial killer, so he goes rogue with his newest partner to track down Scorpio and stop him on his own terms. Harry will stop at nothing to catch the killer and prove the origin of his nickname, Dirty Harry, along the way.I was hoping Dirty Harry would be more of a whodunit exercise than a cat-and-mouse game. The killer is revealed early in the film and with little mystery surrounding the reveal. The opening was fantastic and seemed to be sure to maintain the mystery and intrigue throughout the film, yet once the killer was revealed, the pace began to screech along rather sluggishly. The camera work was fun, however, making sure I stayed put through the entire runtime of the film. Low-angle shots are a surefire way to keep me glued to my seat, and Siegel's use of them so often and effectively was beautiful to watch. Dirty Harry fails the hardest in its inability to hold the same intrigue established in the opening which was a monumental disappointment. If you're looking for an apt cat-and- mouse chase film, Dirty Harry will fit the bill, despite how lacking it is in the mystery component.",

            "content": "Already trenched into the American film consciousness as a handsome,gritty figure in Spagheti Westerns by the end of the 60s,Clint EAstwood would embark on a relatively new genre for the time: the justice-minded,independent hero that blows through bureaucracy and authority to get his man,dead or alive,in contemporary America. This Don Siegel-directed film would set a standard for a new wave of Eastwood films where he wasn't just a tough guy,but THE tough guy on the scene. In retrospect,it seems slightly ironic that a effective,craft-loyal auteur would be synonymous over the nation and world as Inspector \"Dirty Harry\"Callahan,but given his background in Westerns,it fits like a glove.(Just HOW this character managed to be promoted as high as he was given his total sense of contempt for hand-cuffing authority is a plot hole that is never really reconciled,BTW)Callahan has a great record of dispatching of criminal scum on the streets of San Francisco,and he's got a perfect prey in a mostly random killer with a hyena-laugh and witchy voice(Andy Robinson). The killer works the system,first as he victimizes residents,then when he is captured. To say that this doesn't sit well with the flinty,glinty,SFPD inspector would be an understatement,to say the least.From the jarring,seemingly low-key opening scene to the jarring,climactic scene involving a bus load of school kids,this movie is both an effective\"Kick a**\" movie,and yet a wise usage of societal norms and police politics. The sequels this film would spawn would be a lot louder and would up the ante considerably,but this film stands alone as a legend.",

It's hard to not become engrossed or the very least fond of Eastwood's portrayal as he fits the role of the character perfectly, and with his signature catch phrase that has now etched its way into popular culture, Dirty Harry is a film that not only resonates but has held up to the test of time.

            "review_title": "The Most Serious Unserious Movie Ever !",
            "content": "This is a memorable movie for sure. Not for being an attractive action thriller only, but for leaving such a deep effect on the American pop culture, and the hero's image in American movies and TV shows for following decades. Inspector ('Dirty' Harry Callahan) is the godfather of every ideal, angry, and maverick American cop since the early 1970s till now. Here, you'll find some perusal for the dark side of the American good hero (imagine a \"John Wayne\" who can shoot bad guys in the back), while battling a super evil criminal who assures that the modern civilization's law misses some savagery to execute its justice.However, the movie's main downside is that super evil criminal. The script didn't present the character of (Charles 'Scorpio Killer' Davis) as a criminal inasmuch as the crime itself. He steals, blackmails, kidnaps, and kills. Most probably, in the first draft, these very crimes were done by many criminals, then it got modified to make more unity and one villain. Though the final result was uneven and unbelievable. Furthermore, we didn't watch any motive or history for (Scorpio). They made him *The Psychopath Killer* to justify his mega craziness, and compensate for his unstoppable extreme crimes. But with loose absolute evil, read: exaggeration, the character lost its credibility totally.It gets ironic when the antagonist is dealt with by that weakness, while all the caring goes to the protagonist. Clearly, (Harry) is well presented as a sincere cop, who lost his wife, hence dedicated his life for his work, as well as released all of his passions into his war against crime, where no victory without equal violence. And if you felt that the treatment of the whole thing was that superficial, wait to watch the rest of the franchise, where the action ate the drama. Actually, in here, it's the sole time to see (Harry) that desperate to throw his badge into the river, but it mirrors the fact that this movie wasn't meant to be a series.The nudity, the profanity, and the violence are all here. Done for a realistic factor to seduce the critics, or for a commercial factor to seduce the audience, both ways I didn't buy it, or like it. These goods were / are / will be ugly, distractive, and have nothing to do with arts. Day after day, they became inhumanly overabundant, let alone how I believe that they establish, and legislate, degeneration in societies as well!On the upside, the music's lamentable sense was so touching and profound. You'll get it wholly in the last scene, and sorrowfully you won't find it in any of the next sequels. The cinematography was so tense, a little realistic compared to the action movies at the time, and artistic; to draw and color (Dirty Harry) along with his world eloquently. See how (Harry) had that special halo around him, showing as a high shining giant whose kind of isolated and deeply in pain.(Clint Eastwood) seemed bigger than life. It's enough to remember the shot when (Scorpio) looks surprisingly, from the bus that he kidnapped, to see (Harry) standing in black shoes, suit, and sunglasses on the bridge ahead of him. Aside from being a complete magical moment of cinema, or proving that (Eastwood)'s charisma is astonishing, the whole cadre made the tall (Harry) as portly upright part of this disturbed city.(Dirty Harry) is a fierce yet idealistic cowboy, and a simple commercial movie which tells openly a lot about a dirty world that needs dirty manners sometimes, since its laws are deficient. So as another police story, it's rough, impudent, and satiric. But don't mistake it for a serious movie. It's rather the exploitation version of the message movie that tickles important issues. Because if you give it a little thinking, you'll easily see that \"violence begets violence\", hence (Dirty Harry) isn't the solution, instead he's part of the problem. So he's another Hollywood fantasy, which is dirty as a renewal, to attract a new generation, and make good money, while having a cover of sullen reality, and a flavor of light satire. That's why I used to call this movie \"the most serious unserious movie ever\".",

            "content": "I missed this in the theaters it's first time around and saw it a first a few years later as a double bill with it's sequel/prequel Magnum Force. Clint Eastwood is Inspector Harry Callahan, a tough unconventional San Francisco detective who has lost several assignment partners in the line of duty and is kind of like his man with no name western characters in that he is smooth, unsmiling and confident but can explode in deadly violence in a split second. He is tracking a psychotic sniper killer and kidnapper that is terrorizing the city called Scorpio. The Scorpio character is loosely based on the Zodiac killer that killed apparently random victims in the Bay area from late 1968 to late 1969 and taunted police and newspapers for years after claiming additional unconfirmed victims and threatening to kill more including a school bus of kids as a potential target. This story by the husband and wife team of Harry Julian Fink and Rita Fink went through at least three rewrites and screenwriter Dean Riesner was brought on to work on it. The Finks collaborated on five Clint Eastwood films during their careers and Riesner also wrote for five Eastwood films and had been a writer on Eastwood's old TV series Rawhide. Additional dialog was scripted by Terrence Malick and John Milius before the final draft was ready for the screen. Originally titled Dead Right it was to star Frank Sinatra and be directed by Irwin Kerhner. Kirshner was dropped when Sinatra pulled out. Several other actors were rumored to have been approached for the title role including Paul Newman who it is said suggested Eastwood for the role of Dirty Harry. Director Don Siegel, who directed five of Eastwood's films in his career, was brought in. Cinematographer Bruce Surtees who would photographed 12 of Eastwood's films in his career is the film's cinematographer. Veteran film composer Lalo Schifrin provides the score. Harry Guardino, Reni Santori, John Vernon and Andrew Robinson are the principal supporting cast. This movie still looks good today. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",

            "content": "In spite of its age and dated looks DH is probably one of the best cop movies to come out of Hollywood. It spawned a host of variations on a theme, even though some would argue DH took a few ideas from the 1968 Bullitt.The idea of a cop trying to bring criminals to book, but using tactics otherwise outside the law, was quite a novel idea back then and was probably an indictment of how the crimewave in some parts of the States had spiralled during the liberalised late 60's and early 70s.Of course if Mr Harry Callaghan had tried such unorthodox methods of arrest in these politically correct days you can be sure the criminal would have sued for millions of dollars, shouting human rights violations and demanding the cop be arrested & jailed for a thousand years.Which is a salient point in a way, because back in the 70s such Correctness was exactly the kind of thing Callaghan was fighting against along with creaking police procedures of arrest.Not only does he find it hard enough keeping tracks on Scorpio as he causes mayhem in the streets of SF, but he also has to battle the law & order system. Is it any wonder he steps out of line when justice seems to support the alleged criminal rather than protecting the innocents...sounds so familiar these days.Eastwood really got his foot in the Stardom threshold with this movie. Somehow I don't think an ageing John Wayne or Sinatra would have had the same kind of steely glare as Eastwood, especially during the final standoff with Scorpio and Harry recites his infamous \"Punk\" line. Nobody has a tighter jawline than Eastwood at times like this.\nEastwood expands on his previous Dollar \"man with no name\" characters to good effect: essentially we have a man who is more a renegade, a man who tries to live outside the restrictions of law & order in order to achieve a legitimate goal, although unlike the Dollar films Eastwood becomes a little more cultured in the streets of SF rather than way out in the middle of some western desert.The bandits he challenges to duels in the Dollar films are no different to the criminals he challenges in Dirty Harry, and even though he has the law on his side, its often not enough.Siegal's direction and the script never lets up for a minute coupled with a very good musical score. But the best part is of course the stand-off at the end. What Eastwood does with his badge is perhaps one of the great pieces of symbolism in movie history and probably had a million liberals up in arms!The less said about the sequels the better: they seem to follow the Jaws trend, Magnum Force being competent but The Enforcer et al just get steadily worse.Pick the best and make his day, Punk!****/*****",

            "content": "Cast as the eponymous protagonist in Don Siegel's urban thriller \"Dirty Harry\" (1971), Clint Eastwood plays San Francisco Police Inspector Harry Callahan. He can spot a crime in progress and proves it early on when he thwarts a bank robbery while eating a hotdog for lunch. When the assailants emerge from the bank, Harry wields his massive Smith & Wesson revolver, stops a car, kills one black robber and wounds another. Sprawled on the sidewalk in front of the bank with his pump-action shotgun inches away from his fingertips, the robber (Albert Popwell) glares back at Callahan. Harry taunts him. \"I know what're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I kind of lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question, do I feel, lucky? Well, do you, punk?\" Harry grins, confiscates the shotgun and saunters off. The robber wants to know, so Harry takes aim and squeezes the trigger. CLICK! In this memorable scene, Siegel and his scenarists summed up everything about their abrasive protagonist. Later, Callahan coaxes a suicide jumper off a high-rise building by badgering the man. Audiences ate up \"Dirty Harry.\" Eastwood reprised his role as the insubordinate but saintly cop in \"Magnum Force\" (1972), \"The Enforcer\" (1976), \"Sudden Impact\" (1984), and \"The Dead Pool\" (1987), but the sequels lacked the spontaneity of the original. Eastwood accommodated Warner Brothers so the studio would release his personal projects, such as \"The Honkytonk Man\" (1982).Seasoned director Don Siegel of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" had collaborated earlier with Eastwood in another police procedural, \"Coogan's Bluff\" (1968), that explored similar issues about another contemporary, non-conformist Arizona lawman on the trail of a murderer who had fled to New York City. Altogether, Siegel and Eastwood made five films, but \"Dirty Harry\" ranked as their finest work. Like \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" \"Dirty Harry\" appeared during a time of social unrest. The Vietnam War was raging. The \"New York Times\" had published the secret Pentagon Papers. Inspector Callahan represented another of Siegel's pariahs that refused to join the status quo. This controversial, R-rated, police procedural about a cynical cop who gets \"every dirty job that comes along\" generated a debate between liberals and conservatives about police brutality and a suspect's civil rights. Recent court rulings in favor of criminal suspects, namely the Miranda Rights and Escobedo rulings had extended rights to criminals. Liberals lambasted \"Dirty Harry\" as a fascist's manifesto. Later \"Dirty Harry\" sequels would clarify Harry's behavior. \"A man has got to know his limitations,\" Harry says in the sequel when he refuses to join a group of vigilante cops that acts as self-appointed judges, juries and executioners.Callahan clashes with a psychotic sniper who initially holds San Francisco for ransom to the tune of $100-thousand dollars. He targets minorities, Catholic priests and young women. Ostensibly based on the real-life Zodiac killer, Scorpio (Andy Robinson) wears a peace sign as a belt buckle and shows no qualms about killing. The film unfolds with Scorpio atop one skyscraper calmly killing a bikini-clad woman in a swimming pool atop another skyscraper. Eventually, Harry captures Scorpio, but the District Attorney releases him. Our hero\u0097it seems--infringed on the felon's liberties in the Bill of Rights. Harry arrested Scorpio without reading him his Miranda rights, tortured him, and confiscated his sniper's rifle without a search warrant. Worse, Harry knew what he was doing when he violated Scorpio's rights. Callahan wanted to rescue the kidnap victim that Scorpio had buried with limited oxygen in a hole before she died. Later, Scorpio hijacks a school bus carrying children and demands a $200-thousand ransom and a jetliner. Harry refuses to serve as the intermediary. Instead, he thwarts Scorpio, kills him and hurls his badge away\u0097\"High Noon\" style\u0097in disgust.Interestingly, several prominent stars, including Frank Sinatra, Paul Newman, and John Wayne, passed up \"Dirty Harry.\" Siegel wrung nail-biting suspense out of every predicament that Harry finds himself in against the cunning sniper. Although \"Dirty Harry\" earned more money than his previous films, Siegel preferred an earlier Clint Eastwood Gothic movie \"The Beguiled.\" The complexity of \"Dirty Harry\" is reflected Siegel's attitude toward him. Although Harry is the hero, Siegel found himself at odds with Harry's conduct and told one interviewer, \"This doesn't mean I agree with him.\"",

As well as being an exciting and suspenseful story in itself, there is an interesting - and unresolved - subtext about whether the end justifies the means (the film, long before any sequels were envisioned, ends with Harry's vigilante-style policing administering the roughest of justice to killer Scorpio, but then throwing his police shield away in disgust at how impotent due process leaves authority against such people).There is a strong sense of time and place - San Francisco is very much a character in the movie.Lalo Schifrin's score is punchy and contemporary (now, perhaps, a little dated).The supporting cast is excellent, with special praise for Reni Santoni's sidekick Chico, totally unprepared for the partner he is teamed up with, and Andy Robinson's superbly slimy Scorpio, screaming for his rights while denying his victims theirs (the film deliberately fosters a sense of outrage at this).There are non-stop seminal moments throughout the movie, with the \"I know what you're thinking...\" speech being by far the most iconic.And, above all, there is Eastwood, creating a contemporary character with as much resonance as the Man With No Name, so much so that he was brought back for 4 sequels (which, inevitably, dwindled in impact with each successive movie).But this is the first. The original. Never bettered.See it.",

Also great is the character development as it made Clint Eastwood who he is today: Hollywood's foremost tough guy. Though since replaced from the top this movie ensured Eastwood his currently legendary status.Safe to say is that this film put Clint's former personage, the lone tough gunman in the West, into a city setting.

            "content": "\"You know, you're crazy if you think you've heard the last of this guy. He's gonna kill again,\" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) sighs to his superior. A maniac (a fantastic Andrew Robinson) is on the loose, killing anybody who comes to his liking, usually on the edges of rooftops with a polished sniper rifle. His wild, long blond hair blows in the wind with the prowess of a lion ready for an attack, his deranged face snarling with noxious elation. He is the Scorpio, a murderer who finds himself amused when blood spills onto his hands. Callahan has done everything to stop him, yet he has escaped the grip of authority with aggravating repetition.Unfortunately for the so-called Scorpio, Callahan is no Frank Bullitt and is definitely not a Jacques Clouseau-type. Carrying a .44 magnum, which he dubs \"the most powerful gun in the world,\" Callahan is unflinchingly acerbic, humorless, and unafraid to sidestep the law and take justice into his own hands.When Dirty Harry was released in 1971, it was a new kind of cop movie. It was one with an outrageous amount of violence and one with a lack of a moral compass. Simply put, it was a source of serious controversy. Police brutality was something left untouched by most American films, and to have a hero slightly deranged himself was something far and away from the well-defined good guy/bad guy clich\u00e9. But to take Dirty Harry seriously would be like viewing a comic book with a realistic lens; it's a piece of seedy pulp that takes the police thriller genre and stretches it out with operatic carnage and dark alley sleaziness. The streets of San Francisco are like the frames of a graphic novel, colored with dim electric light by night and saturated with disconcerting warmth by day. The film lives in a world where crime runs around with menace, becoming nearly casual to its citizens. Harry Callahan is like Batman, minus the suit, Batmobile, immortal sidekick, and underground lair. He is most well-defined in an early scene where he sits down in a diner for a midday snack. That moment of peace, though, is interrupted when he notices a bank robbery in progress across the street. A few of the criminals have been gunned down, but one lies on the steps of the entrance, bleeding and moaning. Rather than arrest him, Callahan is inspired to taunt him, make him transform from predator to prey in a matter of seconds. He deadpans his way through a mini-speech that seems prewritten as he cocks his gun: \"I know what you're thinking. 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. It would blow you head clean off. You've gotta ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?'\" We discover that the thief is lucky \u2013 Callahan has fired all six shots.But it becomes clear later on that he most likely already knew that all six shots were fired. When it comes to a dirty criminal, however, why not play a sick game of Russian Roulette? Callahan would prefer to teach brutal lessons and give bad guys a taste of their own medicine; Miranda rights and the amendments are for sissies.Harry Callahan was the original tough-guy detective, remaining to be a brute force of fortitude and pointed courage. Without Eastwood, he wouldn't have that ominous edge by his side. It's a performance of precise emotion. He delivers every line with a diverting softly spoken voice, only to later explode with an awesome capability for violence. As he whispers his few words, we can only wonder what's going on in his head. Callahan is such a legendary figure in cinema because every move he makes is recognizable, embedded into the foreboding underbellies of neo-noir. Dirty Harry is iconic for a reason. Few cop movies have been able to thrill without the slight glitter of Hollywood lure. It can be sickeningly violent, but that's only because one foot is glued on action and the other is on realism.

Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan is a San Francisco police officer, with an attitude and uses little methods to what the law prescribes. It becomes a menacing task for Callahan, as he's been assigned to apprehend the menacing killer at all cost, which later unravels into a cat-and-mouse game between the two men. One killer with a sinister, distasteful sense of humour. The other, a killer with just a plain dirty attitude who holds the badge.....What can be said about this film that already hasn't been said? It's Eastwoods most iconic roles and its one of the best movies ever made. And it stands the test of time for several reasons.It's quotable and then some. And not just the 'I know what your thinking....' line, its the endless sarcastic remarks Harry makes to his peers and the fact he gets away with it.And Siegel has a wonderful eye for beautiful shots. From the opening shot where we are staring down the barrel of a gun, to the downright genius of the track away shot from the football field, right down to the coolest shot of the seventies, Harry standing on the bridge, the film looks so fresh and vibrant.Harry is the original bad a** cop, and this film released its own sub genre. The majority of action movies released since then, owe this film a huge debt, including in my opinion the greatest movie ever made, 'Die Hard'.I truly believe that if this was never made, we probably wouldn't have had that influx of crazy action movies in the eighties, and Seagals, Van Damme, and even Schwarzeneggar would probably be obsolete.The story is great, the acting is fantastic, and it has a great score.If you haven't seen this, see it, you must.",

Obviously coasting on the winning formula they had with the titular character, Clint Eastwood is the ultimate bad ass and it's fun to watch him play up that shtick. The movie surrounding him may be secondary, but it's still solid, with a suitably detestable villain and fast paced plot. Not sure if the cop movie cliches were already well established at this time or if this movie really laid the foundation for things to come, but familiar genre tropes abound. Under the modern lens, some things didn't age well, there is some cringey racial insensitivity, next to no female representation and the underlying idea that a rogue cop that shoots first and asks questions later is inherently a good thing, but it's a product of it's time and should be viewed accordingly.",

It has a few good action sequences too. But the most memorable part of the movie is Clint Eastwood's brilliant job as the conservative Inspector Harry Callahan whose character created the benchmark for many other similar movie roles.

            "content": "Early 1970s Hollywood saw the rise of vigilante films, which portrayed cops and citizens who were discontented by the state of crime in America and took up arms without a go-ahead from the police. In 1971, director Don Siegel and western star Clint Eastwood made 'Dirty Harry,' widely viewed as the definitive crime film of its time. While not entirely about vigilantism, 'Dirty Harry' is probably the best example of films that depict a justice system fixated on the rights of criminals when American cities are becoming overrun with felons who pay no heed to the law.'Dirty Harry' focuses on the deeds of Scorpio, a sniveling, obnoxious madman played by Andrew Robinson. Scorpio takes fun in placing all of San Francisco under siege by killing civilians from rooftops and threatening additional deaths if the city fails to pay a huge ransom. After some coddling by the police, Scorpio decides to kidnap a young girl whom he rapes and hides underground with limited oxygen. The police immediately turn to Harry Callahan (Eastwood), an inspector who is frowned upon for his rough-and-ready ways but tolerated since there are few 'dirty' assignments he won't take on. Callahan, already disillusioned by his superiors, is pushed even further to the limit in tracking down Scorpio and the missing teenager. With help from his new partner Gonzalez (Reni Santoni) and hanger-on Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum), Harry manages to capture Scorpio, only to see him walk free after the prosecution drops all charges on grounds of illegal search and seizure. Which leads, of course, to a hostage crisis that no sane person could imagine\u0085While the sentiments of 'Dirty Harry' may now seem quaint, the film still asks important questions about a middle ground between rights of innocent people and the accused. Callahan is depicted as a police officer who wants the American justice system to work, but finds himself at odds when trying to defend San Francisco against a ruthless lunatic. Harry sees law and order disintegrating at the hands of people like Scorpio, who are beyond reason and must be stopped at all costs. Callahan dishes out his personal brand of justice as expected, but the film ends rather bleakly, his vigilante-type deeds being just another indication of a society gone mad.Despite its controversy, 'Dirty Harry' had tremendous impact on the crime genre, leading to four sequels and influencing movies such as 'Death Wish,' 'Lipstick,' '10 to Midnight,' and the Abel Ferrara thriller 'Ms. .45.' A large portion of Dirty Harry's success is owed to Eastwood, whose rugged style of acting in the Leone westerns can be seen here. Eastwood's portrayal is balanced, with none of his speech or physical action wandering into excess. In fact, his acting is at times so understated that Harry comes across as a humorous and somewhat likable man. Only the role of Scorpio calls for an over-the-top presence and this is pulled off masterfully by Andrew Robinson, who admitted to having no experience in reading film scripts. The supporting roles, including Gonzalez (Reni Santoni), San Francisco's mayor (John Vernon), and Lieutenant Bressler (Harry Guardino), are all played with honesty.The straightforward editing of Carl Pingitore ('Play Misty for Me,' 'Across 110th Street') is nicely paced, keeping the action sequences moving at a brisk clip while at times slowing things down to keep the film grounded in reality. 'Dirty Harry' maximizes the San Francisco locations with broad angles and overhead shots by cinematographer Bruce Surtees. Never do we feel that 'Dirty Harry' is taking place in a studio or at a secondary venue. Composer Lalo Schifrin is also in top form with his eerie score that combines synthesizers and a regular ensemble to background this funky, depraved urban landscape.Although its sequels never lived up to the original installment, 'Dirty Harry' became a solid movie franchise, lasting for five titles over a 17-year period. Anyone who has seen heavily-edited, full frame versions of 'Dirty Harry' on television will appreciate Warner Brothers' 2000 DVD release of the film, which comes packed with extras. The movie is presented in its original widescreen format with Dolby 5.1 surround sound; French 'dubbing' is included with subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. Disc extras include a short documentary made at the time of Dirty Harry's release; a new 30-minute program on the impact of Dirty Harry, hosted by Robert Urich; interview clips with several who were involved in the Dirty Harry series; and the theatrical trailer.'Dirty Harry' is in excellent condition, although there are occasional artifacts such as grain and speckling. Unfortunately, its Dolby enhancement is not the finest, putting too much emphasis on gunshots and Schifrin's music. Dialogue and background noise are comparably soft, while Callahan's magnum and Schifrin's bass flex come out throbbing at climactic moments. This is not necessarily a bad thing, although it seems geared to those interested just in action. The original documentary is an interesting look at how 'Dirty Harry' was sold to audiences with its controversial subject matter. WB's new program is well-made and deals with the influence of Harry, but could have explored the film's initial reception and the flack its makers had to live with. Overall, fans of Harry should be pleased and the disc will be of great help in creating a new legion of fans.*** out of 4Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood was a Western icon for a fistful of spaghetti Westerns and cynical American copycats. When he strapped on his .44 Magnum to stride the streets of San Francisco as Inspector Harry Callahan, known to the squad as Dirty Harry, Eastwood turned his frontier persona into an urban cowboy on the mean streets of our urban world and helped him cultivate an iconic image.In Dirty Harry, maverick San Francisco cop Harry Callahan is ordered by the city mayor to stop a pathological, bigoted serial killer who calls himself Scorpio (Andy Robinson who proves to be a wonderfully odious villain). The psycho wants $100,000, or he will continue his bloody work. The mayor and others are willing to capitulate, but Eastwood disagrees, sensing it would be just the first payment. Eastwood bristles when teamed with young Chico (Reni Santoni) against his wishes (Chico fails Callahan on three counts, by being new to the force, Mexican-American, and, perhaps worst of all, college-educated); but he reluctantly begins to accept the junior partner. Scorpio says he's buried a teenage girl somewhere in the city and will let her die unless the town comes up with $200,000. Eastwood gets the job of delivering the money (backed up by Chico), but eventually pursues his own, extralegal route to nail Scorpio.Dirty Harry is both of its time and timeless. Visually it reeks of the early 1970s with enough graphic violence quite a bit of gratuitous female nudity on display. But at the same time the story is a gripping game of cat and mouse between cop and psycho killer that transcends the setting and time period. It is a visceral film, directed with urgency and style by Don Siegel, embellished with some of the coolest electro-jazz confections.But above all, Dirty Harry works because it is driven by the inimitable Clint as Detective \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan. Harry, the hero, is a flawed anachronism - a frontiersman in modern society. His tough-as-nails persona is one that has often been imitated. He bucks authority because he cares more about justice than he does about rules. Harry Callahan is both more openly scornful of the law, an equal opportunity bigot and, thanks to Eastwood's perfectly calibrated performance, more compelling an individual, than Siegel's earlier neo-vigilantes.In real life, we'd be terrified of Harry and the loose cannon he calls a handgun. On the big screen, you can't help but applaud his frontier justice as Eastwood mouths the now iconic line \"Do you feel lucky, punk?\"",

            "content": "Don Siegel has an impressive filmography, by any standards, but this may very well be his most memorable film. Eastwood's, too, depending on whom you ask. It's a movie that came roaring onto the big screen 40 years ago with something to prove, and it won't be forgotten anytime soon. Clint Eastwood stars as SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan who goes head-to-head with a crazed serial killer named Scorpio (Andrew Robinson). Scorpio moves from one victim to the next, with Inspector Callahan hot on his trail. While the upper level officials in the Mayor's office continue scrambling to come up ransom money, Callahan grows impatient with the red tape and civil rights issues that go hand-in-hand with being a cop and takes to vigilante justice (equipped with his ridiculously huge revolver) to bring Scorpio down.It's impressive just how well \"Dirty Harry\" holds up after forty years. It's tense filmmaking, and one of the finest gritty cop movies in cinema history. The film's anti-PC message of speaking for the rights of the victim is clear from the get-go, and punctuated by Harry's open disdain for the rules. Eastwood loves playing this guy; it's right there on the screen. And he sinks his teeth right in. Andrew Robinson really sells the unhinged killer, Lalo Schifin's supercool urban, jazzy score keeps everything humming on a real groove. This was not a movie to be taken lightly. Its impact on pop culture can be still be felt 40 years after the fact. You see a .44 Magnum, you think \"Dirty Harry\". More often than not, you see Clint Eastwood, you think \"Dirty Harry\". When Keifer Sutherland tortures a terrorist on TV, you know deep down that Eastwood pioneered that divisive hero. It's easy to get hung up on Harry's apparent fascistic role model (as Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert famously have), but it's also easy to eschew such politics in favor of what the movie's selling: Eastwood's badass cop is there to set things right, by a moral code that we (as moviegoers) can root for. 8.5/10",

            "content": "\"Do you feel lucky...?\" Yes, I do! Lucky enough to be able to retrospectively admire the greatness of Clint Eastwood. The actor-director was at the forefront of some of the most groundbreaking, original films of all time, A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and the later films he did with Sergio Leone that re-invented the Western, PLAY MISTY FOR ME, the prototype for the stalker film, and of course, this film, DIRTY HARRY, the forefather of the modern day cop film. Before DIRTY HARRY (1971), cop movies were really 'just the facts' films, with cops being portrayed as humdrum, mostly uniformed officers who ALWAYS arrived at the scene one minute too late and who only liked to patrol around in their police cars eating donuts and drinking free coffee. This film changed all that.In DIRTY HARRY, the protagonist is a man's man of a cop: tough, abrasive, smart, quick-thinking, with a take-no-prisoners attitude. Screw the system! Our hero is one San Francisco Police Inspector Harry Callahan (played by the aforementioned Eastwood in a truly legendary performance). I don't think that Eastwood was ever thought of as a great actor, but one thing you can say for his films: he was always in on the joke. The \"joke\" here is that DIRTY HARRY is not just some standard good guys versus bad guys saga. It is really a not-so-subtle swipe at the not-always-fair police-judicial system. The film contains several scenes that illustrate the bureaucratic hogwash that goes along with catching criminals and trying to put them away (Miranda rights, illegal search and seizure, prisoner abuse, etc.) The main criminal in this film is obviously guilty, but the system allows him to go free on technicalities. The bad guy is a sniper who calls himself Scorpio (played by Andy Robinson in one of the creepiest performances of all time). Scorpio assassinates a girl in a swimming pool at the film's outset and then demands ransom from the city or he will kill more people until he gets what he wants. In comes Insp. Callahan, aka Dirty Harry to investigate and catch the killer. Harry is partnered with rookie Insp. Chico Gonzalez (played by Reni Santoni doing fine work). Harry reluctantly accepts Chico as his partner. It is implied that Harry may be prejudiced and he probably has never worked with a minority, but really Harry is a savvy veteran who knows how dangerous life is about to become for his new partner.Ironically, they catch Scorpio early on, but the system lets him free and so Harry's personal quest to bring down this vicious assassin makes up the 2nd half of the film. It must have been a strange twist in 1971 to actually catch the killer halfway through the film! Harry himself becomes a 'criminal' of sorts, stalking Scorpio, waiting for him to slip up, against department orders.DIRTY HARRY has of course one of the most famous speeches (the \"lucky\" speech) in film history, but that is not its only appeal. It is a very thrilling piece that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats. The on-location shooting in beautiful San Francisco really is a character itself. The film really captures the gritty, urban feel and while the plot may be a tad preposterous, realistic scenery adds to the action, drama, and plot. The great director Don Siegel directed this film and it is right up there with the best of the 1970s. It definitely ushered in a new kind of cop hero in Harry Callahan, aka DIRTY HARRY.",

            "content": "Don Siegel's classic Dirty Harry has lost none of its power during all these years. Clint Eastwood's character is still among the most memorable and toughest police officers in any film, and also Andy Robinson as psychotic Scorpio is totally unmatchable in his lunatic performance. Dirty Harry is exactly what similar movies of today should be; far from calculated entertainment and thoroughly personal work.Dirty Harry is a tough cop in San Francisco where killer is on the loose. The killer demands huge amount of money in order to quit the killings, victims being chosen by random. Police is helpless as they don't know what to do, saving tax moneys seems to be more important than saving the lives of subsequent victims. Harry gets a partner and they start the relentless hunt and fight against time and that psychotic killer, named Scorpio.I hardly can say any negative points about this marvellous piece of film. This is challenging action cinema at its greatest. From what point it is \"allowed\" to use violence in order to make justice? Harry doesn't want to obey stupid and restrictive orders by authorities, he only wants to get that killer and stop the violence. He doesn't want Scorpio dead, he just wants to get him and trap him and thus get him in jail. But this seems not to work out, as all the things are against this kind of theory and Scorpio seems to have even media sympathy and protection on his side. It is obvious that Scorpio is unstoppable by using lawful methods, so Harry decides to do the Dirty job and stop him in any method, lawful or not. He is willing to sacrifice himself in order to stop the killings of Scorpio. This is really what makes the viewer think as even Scorpio has his rights that should not be violated. It is important to ask how this kind of person has been born and why, maybe the answer is not too far away from ourselves and the society we live in. The film does not praise violence, it just analyzes it and shows many aspects of it. The film criticizes society very much and is meant to be seen by all the leaders and police chiefs anywhere in the world. The setting is very gritty and ugly (both mentally and physically) as the city is full of pimps, criminals, violence and depravity, so it is obvious, there's something even worse than Scorpio and that may be/is the whole reason for Scorpio's existence.Dirty Harry is fantastically shot and edited and all the cinematic aspects of the film are very professional and as powerful today as they were back then, in the early 70's. This is among the most intense and exciting police thrillers I've seen and beats easily most of its imitators and miserable commercial efforts copying this original and incorruptible classic. Eastwood is here in his greatest performance as hardboiled cop in world that has boiled him very hard. It is easy to see how he puts his soul into the role as Harry. Andrew Robinson is among the scariest psychos I've seen, and just look at him at the end scene in the school bus. Very powerful and haunting performance by this talented actor.Don Siegel is here as masterful as director can be, and I think this is his masterpiece, but of course there are many other great films in his filmography, too. Dirty Harry is a film that should be seen in theatre but if that's not possible, make sure you watch it in widescreen format as the film looks gorgeous in its original wide aspect ratio. I'd seen this previously on full screen format, and now that I watched it in full widescreen, the viewing experience was fantastic. It is sad that so many home videos are in wrong aspect ratio made to \"suit your television.\"\nDirty Harry is classic masterpiece of action cinema and very thought-provoking in its content, themes and messages about society and people in it and in charge of it. Highly recommended and gets definitely the highest 10 rating from me.",

Dirty Harry (Clint Eastwood) is out to get the notorious and crazed Scorpio-killer Andy Robinson (Andrew Robinson). It is a film worth watching if you like crime-thrillers with some action.Some critics are not fond of Andy Robinson as the Scorpio-killer but I have to completely disagree. I think Robinson was perfect for the role. With Andrew playing the role, we have a killer (Andy) with an innocent look about him - and that alone is enough to believe him blameless of such gruesome crimes - but behind his looks is a mind of a criminally sick man. Outstanding performance by Andrew Robinson.Clint Eastwood - he is just as good as always. He is a well seasoned, brilliant actor.8.5/10",

            "content": "Along with The French Connection, this influential thriller set the standard for cop movies for the 70's, i.e. tough, violent, bleak and unflinching. This movie, in particular, attracted a lot of criticism that it was a fascistic celebration of police brutality. And while it's hard to argue against this, Dirty Harry is an extremely well-made thriller that is still sufficiently edgy and energetic to appeal to modern audiences.It's about a renegade cop called Harry Callaghan who is on a mission to stop \u2013 by any means possible \u2013 a psychotic killer-hippy who is holding San Francisco to ransom. Clint Eastwood is perfectly cast in the lead role. This, along with his Man With No Name roles in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy, is his most defining and iconic screen performance. He is believably tough and has a great screen presence. Other standout members of the cast are Andy Robinson as the vile villain and John Vernon as the agreeably cheesy mayor. The film is helped hugely, too, by the great soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin. This funky score gives the film an energy and atmosphere that's integral to its success. It compliments both the high octane action and the suspense scenes. There's some great cinematography too, such as the beautiful pan of the San Francisco Bay early in the movie and the extraordinary reverse zoom that takes us from Callaghan torturing Scorpio in the sports stadium to high up in the sky; an incredible shot.This film still holds up well after all these years. It still has retained much of its edge. Don Siegel keeps everything moving along at a great pace and shows himself very adept at creating a threatening atmosphere when required. The set-piece in the park at night is almost in Italian giallo territory. Going back to the accusations of Dirty Harry appealing to a right-wing mentality and that the Scorpio character represents the ugly side of the counter-culture, deserving of no mercy from the authorities. While all this is true, it's also true that the villain is such an irredeemable scumbag that it is impossible not to back Harry Callaghan to the hilt. And at the end of the day this is a cop-thriller so no one should really be taking it THAT seriously. A much better approach is to just sit back, relax and enjoy a classic hard, sleazy and thrilling piece of 70's cinema.",

It started a trend with a main character who operates just within or just outside the law, dispensing justice with hard-nosed action. The San Francisco scenes are excellent; the dialog is perfect; and Eastwood was great in this role. The action is very realistic, although we know that our laws would not allow it to really happen. The bad guy is so bad that we have no pity for him at all and are happy to see him die. The role was played to perfection by Andrew Robinson, who was new to movies, coming from the stage.

            "review_title": "The \"Cleaner\" of our Dirty Consciences ...",
            "content": "Last time, while I was reading the news on my laptop, I was both shocked and saddened by the story of a young 17-year old girl raped and killed while jogging before her corpse would be meticulously hidden and burnt, a sordid and macabre story whose savagery unfortunately equals its daily frequency in our world. And while I was reading the Internet readers' comments, I found out that many of them, filled with the same anger than I, were demanding vengeance or asking for more ruthlessness from the authorities. And although I always try to be rational, the cruelty of the crime made me question my own approach to justice, if its blindness puts the victim and the criminal on an equal foot or if its only purpose should be to punish and repress those who banish themselves from society.That's the issue, the frontier between repression and fascism is so thin that any zealous expression of Law's repressive hand can be perceived as oppressive. This is why \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan was probably one of these characters that embodied so many contradictions he became one of the quintessential anti-heroic figures of American cinema, and it's no surprise that he was created during that glorious 'New Hollywood' era that tackled social issues with a rebellious attitude and total disregard for political correctness. The contradiction of \"Dirty\" Harry is that in the context of the 70's where urban criminality reached a high level of violence and savagery, it put the police cops in a weak position, in the public opinion's eyes, so people needed a strong model to incarnate Law and Authority. But during that same context, a new air of freedom and rebellion against the power was filling the youth's hearts, or any idealistic people that could perceive Harry as a fascist. We can say that basically, there were two sides in 1971, the Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle and the Alex De Large's side, while \"Dirty\" Harry has something of both.Harry Callahan is the incarnation of Law in its most Antic form, carrying his iconic Magnum .44 as the sword to fight the evildoer and the shield to protect the widow and the orphan, yet he's victim of his own hatred, and uses violence as a personal policy, with a Magnum that provides a virile magnetism, inspiring our respect despite everything. Indeed, Clint Eastwood incarnates this violence with such charisma and the perfect amount of fierceness in his eyes that it's hard not to find him appealing, and I defy any man not to have a male crush on him, seriously, I'm not ashamed to admit that he's probably the most handsome and manly character ever. And what makes him so dangerously attractive is the key element he has in common with De Large, more than Doyle : his enjoyment of ultra violence. If you look closer : he get his kicks by applying justice with his Magnum, as a phallic extension. The way he uses his 'feel lucky' catchphrase as an usual tirade that allows him to tease the criminal is the little delight, sadistic maybe, but with quite an allure.But I guess this is the danger of Dirty Harry and what earned the film so many criticisms at the time of its release when it was labeled as a \"right-wing fantasy\" or a film with fascist tendencies, as if it conveyed the dangerous idea that the ends justified the means, and the use of violence can be legitimate in some extreme cases. And maybe this is the manipulative aspect of the film, it features an extremely vicious criminal who kills innocent people, more innocent than usual, just for money and certainly not without pleasure. As much as we admire the performance of the actor, he's impossible to root for, as he represents the degeneration of a society with no values and morality, and the most capable hero must have the same level of cruelty as the villain. It's an eye for an eye yes, it's not very legal, but this is Harry's law. It's not fascist, it's just 'extreme'. An extreme way used in the right side of the law, and 40 years later, despite all the criticism from left-wing or feminist movements, the movie had four sequels, and Harry Callahan is one of the most iconic movie characters ever, #17 in AFI's list of heroes, for having paved the way to other classic \"loose cannon\" cops facing incompetent superiors like in \"Die Hard\" or \"Lethal Weapon\".The movie stood the test of time, and for a simple reason: people needed a character like \"Dirty Harry\" to identify with, to stop associating the law with dumb policemen or simple comic reliefs, they needed a model of power and manly integrity. The \"right-wing fantasy\" is half right, there is something super-heroic in Callahan, that makes the movie like a sort of fantasy, but the man is vulnerable, he takes hits, he's victim of his own prejudices and bigotry, he's got the same flaws as an Ethan Edwards or a Fred C. Dobbs, which makes his brutality, more forgivable because he's fundamentally good. He's definitely the archetypal antihero, and maybe his appeal is revealing or our own subconscious perception of violence. Something we condemn, we debate on, but which we're glad when it's being done.I started the review by evoking a news item, I will conclude with something more global by comparing Harry to those soldiers who were sent to Vietnam if we keep the movie into context, or now in Iraq, or Afghanistan to do all the dirty jobs, while the politicians were talking about freedom, justice, and democracy, all these big words without echoes in those doomed places in the world. Harry fascinates us, because he makes us think of our own hypocritical approach to violence, and our possible need of dirty Harries to clean our consciences, maybe that's the question we've got to ask ourselves.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood will always be thought of as Dirty Harry - even I, who had never before seen Dirty Harry, knew enough about the movie for instance, to be able to understand the similarities between Harry and Eastwood's character of Walt Kowalski from 2008's \"Gran Torino.\" This is his signature role for good reason - he's perfectly cast as Inspector Harry Callahan and the movie is both exciting and interesting and has a realistic feel to it.Callahan is assigned to locate a serial killer who calls himself \"Scorpio\" and threatens to kill a person a day unless the city of San Francisco pays him $100,000 (later raised to $200,000.) Callahan doesn't go by the book. In his view, his job is to get the bad guys and that's what he does - except that not going by the book lets the serial killer get away, because his constitutional rights were violated. That's really the underlying theme of the movie - how do you defend the rights of the innocent victims when you have to be so concerned about the rights of the accused. That's a concern that remains with us even today, so even though the movie is almost 40 years old, it still has a relevance to it; a message which will resonate with many people. The movie leads up to a pretty exciting ending with the school bus hijacking, and Callahan's last statement of contempt for the system in which he works.If I were to compare this to, say, \"Gran Torino\" (Eastwood's latest and perhaps last movie) I'd say that I preferred \"Gran Torino\" more because there seemed to be more sustained excitement in it, whereas \"Dirty Harry\" (because Callahan is an active cop) has a few more mundane scenes, since it has to portray the system in which Callahan works. I still liked this, though. It's a great role for Eastwood.",

It looks like it's going to be a completely self-explanatory, ostensibly obvious and pretty painful watch with as predictable a development as the ending would be. It turns out that: no, that's just that first half hour. Gradually the film takes a hold of the viewer and drags him into a more enticing development of the plot, one that engages the public right into the thick of the film's crux. It's like the film at its core has a heavy weight to bear and wishes to unload the burden onto the viewer, who finds himself morally and emotionally committed to the lead character's dilemma: going by the letter of the law and following standard procedure - or - choosing what 'feels right' regardless of the institutions.The film does a well enough job to not be as clich\u00e9d as you'd expect, to not be too linear with the plot which is praiseworthy since the film's entirety is really just one big premise (and 'Dirty Harry' so easily could've been a constant reiteration of the same scene over and over), and the protagonist despite being basically a comic book character still remains very relatable for his humanity which is also very much commendable. Strong ending with a very symbolic gesture which gives the whole all the more meaning and appeal, and you know a movie that ends well is infinitely more important than a movie that merely starts well (!).7.5/10.",

This movie is constant but steady cop action movie. Sure some parts the cops seem overly incompetent at times and the villain sometimes comes off really ridiculous although vile. But it doesn't go way too over the top, overall this movie is a steady action/thriller that doesn't get boring. It even has classic one liners like \"you gotta ask yourself one question.

Of the 5 in the series, it received the highest rating by IMDb viewers. That's good, just not nearly high enough.2). The storyline of a good, yet very tough, widower cop who's extreme conviction to stopping crime (that is matched only by his self-confidence and bravura), set the tone for so many copycats (in one form or another), to follow.3). This is #1 factor: Andy Robinson. I have spoken to so many, and it's acknowledged in so many circles; that his portrayal of the killer was beyond impeccable. Believable like so many other ARE NOT. Robinson had much trouble landing roles after Dirty Harry. So how can you be typecast from a single 2 hr movie? Only one way. Just be that damned convincing. He wasn't nuts, nor was he portrayed that way. He was just evil. Sure Hannibal was scary, but that villain is quasi-fantasy, and that's ok. There was nothing unbelievable about Andy Robinson's Scorpio killer. He didn't just pull it off; he killed it. Deserved awards. That's not an easy role to play. Most villains since then, are so over the top, they're often cartoonish.4). If you want to have a good looking guy, who's ultra cool, successful with the ladies, suave, well, who better than Clint? I mean really. Can you believe Sinatra was the original choice by casting. Thank God he turned it down. I mean seriously, that's fair.I wouldn't ask Eastwood to sing New York New York. I don't know a female friend, including my own honey, that doesn't concur on this point (re- Eastwood's sex appeal.)5). The story moved well, with different scenarios.A). First, your introduction to who Harry really is (Bank Robbery)\nb). Why he's called dirty (his new partner, the suicide attempt, and more.).C). Scorpio running Harry around SF, so as to get his ransom without a hitch.D). Scorpio turning the tables on Harry by having a professional beat him 1/2 to death, blame Harry, and get the press on his side, with the primary goal achieved, getting Harry off his tail.E.). The final showdown was very good as well, which I won't go into since I'm sure y'all have seen the movie 10-15 times by now.

I never like it when the writer doesnt take his movie audience seriously.Part of a series of 4 Clint Eastwood cop movies in which violence and retribution get glorified and civil rights and police procedures get ridiculed. This is a full on promo for police brutality and the way in which this story is portrayed I was rooting for the cops to get violent as well. That's the power of this classic, it really quite convincingly let's me believe that cop violence is good and the only way forward to combat crime, which ofcourse it isnt.Lots of fierce criticism followed when this movie was released in 1971, because of the glorification of violence and the disrespect for civil rights. In the second editon of the Dirty Harry series, called \"Magnum Force\" Eastwood has suddenly become a civil rights promotor instead of bashing those rights in like he does in this first edition. Clint Eastwood mentioned in an interview that he liked \"Magnum Force\" the best of all the Dirty Harry series (4).Besides the well known cool poses and oneliners by Clint Eastwood, lots of attention for technical detail went into this movie, resulting in great (telelens) photography for instance, the likes I havent seen much lately.

            "content": "I would dare say one of the more important films in Eastwood's rich career. His Harry has become an icon and a definition of the character he will play for the next few decades. Stubborn, full of hatred for almost all people, but always ready to act justly according to his postulate, which is why he often conflicts with the law. Certain criticism in this film is obviously directed at the American law that allows a multiple psychopath-killer to go free. A psychopath called Scorpio, whose real name we don't even know, is creepy and dangerous, a worthy opponent of Dirty Harry. His character is based on the famous Zodiac killer who harassed, killed and left messages to the police. The film balances brilliantly between a thoroughbred shot and a suspenseful thriller, and the Magnum is currently becoming the most popular gun in the world. We see a great characterization of the characters seemingly in small and irrelevant scenes and conversations where we learn a lot about what Callahan really is, like a scene where his lunch is interrupted by a bank robbery, when he talks to a potential suicide, to a partner or his boss and law enforcement. What a cult classic it would be without the iconic final showdown and the very end of the film. After solving the case, but in his own way, Harry showed one contrast that was in keeping with his character. Although he has sorted everything out with a big bang, he still ends up in silence and without a word, far away from us because he is aware that as a representative of the law he still cannot protect those who should protect the same law. The interesting thing is that the directorial debut of Eastwood (Play Misty for me) was released in the same year, and we also have a collaboration with Don Siegel, the director of Dirty Harry, who got a role in the film here. What a great year in the resume! (This is 1971, a full fifty years have already passed). A real classic that will be given to us four more sequels, but also an influence on many films that were made after this. I can say that this was a very brave move to make a film like this in the very beginning of the seventies. Eastwood has made better films, of better quality, but this is certainly the cornerstone of his career, probably the most iconic and recognizable because in later films he will always weave at least a little Inspector Callahan (Gran Torino is a film about retired Dirty Harry, right?).\nI feel lucky, even though I'm not a punk.",

If \"Dirty Harry\" were made today it would not have any impact at all on the public like it did back in 1971 and would have flopped in the box office because the public has learned a lot since then. What the public learned is that if you take the rights away from one person, no matter how guilty he may seem to be, you take the rights away from every one of us no matter how innocent we are. In the movie Harry could do no wrong, he's right in every one of his actions, in his war against the criminal element of San Francisco. His superiors, from the mayor on down, come across as gutless cowards at best or lying hypocrites at worst and make those watching the movie wonder just how they ever got elected and kept their jobs in the first place.With the danger to the public now gone Harry, in disgust, at the end of the movie throws his badge into the river where the dead Scorpio is floating, whom he had just shot. Like Gary Cooper in \"High Noon\" Harry turns his back on the society that he just saved from the likes of Scorpio and walks into the sunset leaving them to fend for themselves, because they didn't accept and appreciate what he's done for them.In short the movie \"Dirty Harry\" was really a propaganda film for less laws and more power for those in power. It was interesting to see that in only two years, at the height of the Watergate scandal in 1973, after \"Dirty Harry\" was released that it's sequel \"Magnum Force\" had \"Dirty Harry\" Callahan talking like the wimps and cowards in the first \"Dirty Harry\" movie. Harry is now in favor of letting the law and the system do it's job. Harry's enemy in that movie is a squad of vigilante cops who were nothing but \"Dirty Harry\" clones led by a corrupt police official and at one point in the movie they even invited Harry to join them which of course he refused. Thats what was the difference between the original \"Dirty Harry\" movie and the four sequels that followed it. The first took itself seriously and the others didn't. What we learned since 1971, when \"Dirty Harry\" was released, was what Benjamin Franklin said over two hundred years ago: \"That when one gives up his rights for peace and security he ends up having neither\", and so did the film makers of the \"Dirty Harry\" movies.",

Clint Eastwood has had loads of these, but Dirty Harry still stands as his defining moment.Eastwood claimed in a documentary that the film struck a chord with people at that time because of the legal system being more concerned with the rights of the criminal than the victim. The audience feel Harry's frustration at not being able to see justice done. The legal system practises law, Harry Callahan and his 44 Magnum practise justice.The film is more famous for setting the standards for urban cop movies. It's fair to say that every screen cop since then owes some inspiration to Harry Callahan i.e no Martin Riggs, no Vincent Hanna. There wouldn't even be a Rambo. Between Eastwood, director Don Siegel and writers Harry Julian Fink and his wife, R.M Fink, they conjured up a cop that people looked up to and admired.

            "content": "Dirty Harry can be argued as having been the pioneer of cop films which paved the way for many more cop films later on. As this genre is increasingly popular, it is hard to compare and to see how this film works in regards to itself. Keeping in mind that this is a very early cop film I would have to say that it did a pretty good job.I don't think I have ever actually seen a young Clint Eastwood before, and it was rather unnerving to see so much likeness of how he looks now compared to then. He did a good job of playing the cool, tough cop who - though is a man of the law, doesn't really follow it. He judges his morality as higher than others and in the name of justice, does what he thinks is right in order to correct the wrong. Andrew Robinson who plays the killer gives an erratic performance which befitted his character. Very wild and out of control, his 'crazy' eyes are characteristic of his character, as are the animalistic screams he makes.The story is pretty average, with the focus on Harry and his obsession on getting the killer. The film kind of shows that the law isn't very good at protecting its citizens though, with Harry being depicted as the only one who really cares if the killer is caught (with the exception of his partner Chico). But the story was pretty engaging and had good action scenes.There was also some pretty great shots in this. We get some pretty good point of view shots from Harry and the killer's perspective. But noticeably, the most impactful shot is probably the one where Harry is standing on the bridge as the bus travels on the road below. For some reason it reminds me of the terminator, what with his sunglasses and all.However this film does have some issues with race, gender and social hierarchy. For one, all the high ranking officers/ powerful figures are white and the robbers who appear briefly are black. The killer himself while is white, is feminized in the way he walks and screams while Harry is the epitome of masculinity with his calm demeanour and low voice. There are hardly any women in this film too, except to be victims or someone's wife, not to mention that the killer is made out to be homophobic as he targets a gay man in one of the scenes. Furthermore the many reasons why dirty Harry is called dirty comes into play, not just as a referral to him doing all the dirty jobs, but also because he is a sort of peeping tom.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",

            "content": "As one of the world's biggest Clint Eastwood fans I can already foresee fellow Eastwood fans taking offense to my 'low' rating. It actually surprised me when I re-watched Dirty Harry which I hadn't seen for probably better than 10 years. It isn't that I dislike Dirty Harry whatsoever. You couldn't possibly NOT like Dirty Harry, the character and the film is legendary and I thoroughly enjoy ranting out Harry's infamous \"Do you feel lucky, punk?\" speech whenever I get the chance. However I also believe Dirty Harry has lost something to time. One of the things that makes Dirty Harry so legendary is the timing. Dirty Harry put a strong face to the law who didn't have the best reputation coming out of the sixties and rioting. Harry Callahan hated everyone equally...he wasn't racist, he just hated all scum of any color and wasn't afraid to pull his gun to blow that scum away if need be. Essentially Harry Callahan was the original Jack Bauer (24--Kiefer Sutherland) The film set up a deranged killer that certainly looked the psycho role and you rooted for Harry because he was determined to always do the right thing no matter what he had to do to do it.Clint Eastwood is Dirty Harry. He was Harry before Harry existed and he'll be Harry long after he's gone. Eastwood being the baddest ass dude on the planet and Harry is clearly the baddest ass cop on the planet. It's not a brilliant performance but it also has more depth than some of his earlier work, like his Westerns. It is good that they serialized the Dirty Harry films because this first movie left you wanting to know more about him. Dirty Harry launched a four decade career for actor Andrew Robinson who after seeing him play the \"Scorpio\" killer you'll be convinced he truly is deranged. He has few lines but what he does with his facial expressions and his eyes is just astounding. The large supporting cast includes the likes of John Vernon, John Larch, and Reni Santoni to name a few of the stronger members. The problem is they all should get more screen time and they seem like strong characters but they take a back seat.Dirty Harry could also be described as one of the great cat and mouse films of all time. Harry chasing Scorpio through various locations and situations but then that isn't the only thing happening in the film. Harry is also breaking up robberies, stopping to help citizens and busting the scum off the street. Legendary director Don Siegel takes the helm and gives it his gritty style that is a must for the film. It's almost like he takes the wild west and turns it into a modern day San Francisco. Siegal and Eastwood worked together a lot in the seventies and I'm thinking why Eastwood was likely able to create Harry Callahan exactly the way he wanted him to be. Dirty Harry is almost always classified as an \"action film\" but it isn't. Instead Dirty Harry is a dark drama about a cop who will stop at nothing to take a psychotic off the streets. Harry Callahan is Jack Bauer, Martin Riggs, Starsky, Hutch, Rockford, and Columbo rolled into one hero. It is a must see but don't expect it to live up to the standards of nowadays. 7/10",

The fact is that it's not. This movie is supposed to represent realistic violence and give us a glimpse of San Francisco in the `70s. At the same time it showed us a cop who doesn't go by the rules but still gets results. Harry is basically a character we can all relate with and that combined with every day violence makes a more interesting and complex feature.

            "content": "So much has been made of the character of \"Dirty Harry\" and what he stands for that it's easy to forget just how technically well-made this film is.\nI think we all know about what kind of a cop Eastwood plays in these films, so I won't go into great detail about the character. I will say, however, that Clint Eastwood's portrayal of this maverick cop is the main reason he is my all-time favorite actor. In this original installment, we see Dirty Harry track down a sociopath sniper who is picking off random victims and demanding $ from the city. Sniper cases have become all too familiar in real life these past couple of years, thus it sort of makes this film timely despite its age. The story, acting, and pacing are superb. But where this film really sets itself apart from the others in the series is the work of director Don Siegel and cinematographer Bruce Surtees. So many memorable shots! My favorite are as follows:Very early on, we see the sniper taking his position on a rooftop in San Francisco. He has a woman in a swimming pool on the roof of another building in his sights... Bang! She never could have dreamed what hit her, but we could see it coming from a mile away.A few moments later, Clint is up on the rooftop where the shot was fired. As he walks around looking for clues, the camera follows his every step, and we get an incredible view of the entire San Francisco Bay behind him. Wow!And how about that shot of him with the sniper in the middle of the football field? The camera raises and almost floats out of old Kezar Stadium as Clint begins to \"apply pressure\" to the gunshot wound he has inflicted on the \"suspect\". This is one of the most unforgettable shots I have ever seen in a film.And the very next shot is so beautiful, yet so dreary. We have Clint on a hillside over-looking the Golden Gate Bridge in the earliest glimpse of morning light while below him, the body of a young girl is being recovered from a hole in the ground where our \"suspect\" left her to die.San Francisco looks like such a beautiful city. Much like in real life, the San Francisco of this film serves as a heavenly stage for some truly grotesque behavior by its inhabitants. This was the first dvd I ever bought. I'm glad I did, because I had forgotten what a truly awesome film this was.10 of 10 stars seems fair enoughSo sayeth the Hound.",

            "content": "In the early 70s, the city of San Francisco was a place of many diverse lifestyles. As a seasoned officer for the SFPD, Inspector Harry Callahan has made these various experiences his routine, and he doesn't like it one bit. Preferring the \"shoot first, ask second\" approach to police work, Callahan is living in a city where his version of justice is old-fashioned. His grit has put him at odds with the upper-ranks, and as a result he is given every dirty case investigation. When we first meet our titular character, he has been brought into the Mayor's office because a psychotic man self-named \"Scorpio\" has sent a ransom letter. The man has already killed once, and we have seen his skill with a sniper rifle. The criminal says that he will continue his killing rampage unless he is given $100,000. Contrary to Callahan's insistence on taking down the crook before he kills again, the department decides to play the bad guy's game. This decision will send Callahan to track down the elusive Scorpio, and to reveal the growing failure in the city's justice system.For years and years, I've heard that Dirty Harry is a classic. The \"did I fire five shots or six?\" and \"do you feel lucky, punk?\" lines have been on every list I've ever seen of \"Most Famous Lines of All-Time\", and so I was excited to see this film at last. Clint Eastwood is a master of the \"lone hero\" sub-genre of action flicks, and this is one of his signature roles. While this film does highlight Eastwood's steely composure and quick gun-hand, I found this film lacking in one major area: its storyline. Maybe it was the fact that I watched it on TV (meaning multiple pauses for fast-forwarding), or maybe it's because it truly did lack in proper execution, but this movie just did not flow well enough for my liking. Hailed as one of the best thrillers of the 1970s, I came into this film with quite high expectations, and these prospects were found soundly untouched. Putting aside this fault, from a technical standpoint, this film was well done. The cinematography was done reasonably well, and the acting was the same. Though this movie did not receive any attention from the Academy, this film in my opinion was edited very well. Following my time watching this film, I looked up some other people's reviews, both amateur and professional. In some cases, the reviewer saw something in the film that I did not. However, I found the factor that both made it a success at its time of release and the reason why it did not click with me: it's portrayal of society at a time where it clashed with the norm. At the time of Dirty Harry's release, the popular trend in society was to be more focused on sympathizing with the killer and less on the victim. This film was in conflict with the fashionable and recycled idea of its time period, and that is what makes this film a classic. In addition to the storyline flaws, there were also some, in my opinion, unneeded nudity pieces. We see at least two naked women (prostitutes), and I don't think that they added to the story. As I think about it, I think that I know where the director was going with it. By showing these foul people living in the city that Callahan has sworn to protect, we see one of the major reasons why he does not trust in his own cityWith the combination of the pacing errors and the extraneous nudity, I found this film to be pretty good, yet not as good as I had hoped. I think that this film only did fire five shots and not six; leaving one needed bullet in the chamber. www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",

            "content": "This film is the absolute matrix for a series of four more films with and by Clint Eastwood as well as a new way to deal with the problem of extreme crime and both the police answer and the political lack of courage in front of this emerging serial killing practice. We are in 1971 before the emergence of profiling that will come from the FBI in Quantico. So both police departments (led by elected sheriffs or marshals) and political personnel, like mayors and district attorneys, do not know what to do with such criminals and they tend to take a conservative stance hiding behind the very famous Miranda (the tree hiding the forest) and treating the crimes separately, hence erasing the serial dimension. Clint Eastwood reacting along the same line as the general public considered that the police had to be a lot more responsive, hence active and even brutal with these criminals, to the point of shooting first without any warning and asking questions afterwards, and only if they did not have any bullets left in their weapons. Some yelled at abuse of power. Others applauded to support the use of force to protect innocent bystanders. We were in the post 1968 period, the post Woodstock period, and the post hippy period. That strong stance on Clint Eastwood's side was the backlash at excessive tolerance and liberalism that was shown for what it had become in films like \"Zabriskie Point\" or \"Fritz the Cat,\" a direct encouragement to criminal activities.That feeling of fear in the wide public was also racially motivated for some white people because that was the time when the Black Panther Party and the Nation of Islam started using the second amendment to justify their decision to carry weapons in public in full respect of what all whites could do. This feeling was amplified by the persistence of the Vietnam War and the very conservative policy of Richard Nixon. The number of casualties in Vietnam and the cost of the war, not to speak of the cost of the veterans who were lucky enough to come back in one piece though quite often severely impaired, becoming more and more visible and expensive, the people were quite ready to ask for a change in policy, a return of money in larger quantities to security within the country, which meant the end of the war. And yet it was still to go on for four years, increasing all the time the exasperation of the public.This film is still slightly slow but it is stampeding away in 1971. That was an action film and it had to be fast, though it is here more endurance than speed, and yet many of the tricks that were to develop in the next decades were already there: short sequences edited in clean cut ellipses. The camera did not have any time and energy to waste to give small descriptive details but it emphasized the successive moments in the action, even at times in a nearly impossible sequence, like Inspector Harry climbing to the top of the high building from which the serial killer had shot his first victim in less time than it took the coroner's team to wrap up the body of the victim and take it off the crime scene. Here the editing ellipse with Harry at the top point of the building and the body of the victim being removed makes it look extremely fast and meaningful.But this film is the matrix for many films to come that expose the inability of elected personnel, on both the police side and the political side, and even the judicial side, to understand that some urgent revision of police procedures has to be worked out \u2013 out of a magician's hat if necessary \u2013 that would at the same time respect judicial and legal procedures, empower the police to respond to such criminals at top speed, and protect the public against such criminals who cannot be saved in anyway because they like \u2013 sorry some of them do love \u2013 killing. From this obvious point to the idea that they have to be killed on the spot while committing a crime there is only one small step that is often climbed or taken in the heat of action. But we can be sure this film was the matrix of what was to become very popular detective \u2013 or rather nowadays police \u2013 series. Colombo is out and CSI or NCIS are in. And then you can work on details with Dexter or Criminal Minds and Bones. But it is always the same idea: these serial killers have to be neutralized at best \u2013 or worst \u2013 and eliminated from society at worst \u2013 or at best. For Inspector Harry the second option is the only one. Since then a lot of thinking has been done and particularly we have understood that such serial killers may be psychopaths or sociopaths, but they are necessarily super intelligent and they cannot be considered as intellectually underdeveloped, let alone handicapped or differently abled if you prefer.That's probably why Clint Eastwood will come back to that character four more times over the next seventeen years.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",

Comparing the two is exhausting, but here's the basics.'Harry' is a continuation of the American anti-hero theme, this time as the Western vigilante with a badge.  It is neither slick nor stylish anymore and could be considered Don Siegel's version of \"The Jungle\" for law enforcement.  It isn't entertainment, but calling it \"social satire\" is an overstatement.  In the 30+ years since its release, 'Harry' has aged badly. Clint is nothing more than the stereotypical bigoted Southern cop and given the maxim of his Western counterpart, the Man with No Name.  Not even the value of the music has remained.  Music, after all, is what the director uses to get our emotions going because he can't do it with images most of the time.'French' is a pseudo-documentary that tries using an offensive snob for a character.  Like 'Harry', it isn't slick by any modern definition, but that isn't the point.  The three points made by the movies (police brutality, serial killers, and drug trade) are as what must've been revolutionary ideas for their times, but they've dated severely and are too simple by today's standards.  Just look at 'Traffic'.Overall, these two films really aren't necessary anymore, but are useful for historical value to show where we've come from.  For that I feel justified in my equal rating.  If the 70s tried exposing the underbelly in America, 'Harry' and 'Connection' failed in their duties.(50%)",

Although the whole team were possibly the worst police force I've ever seen on screen and I've seen all 7 'Police Academy' (1984-94) films.The story was a similar concept to 'Die Hard With A Vengeance' (1995) in the way that the killer took him on a wild goose chase, but without the same excitement and as a result, a huge lack of interest on my part, because it just wasn't done skilfully at all.I preferred the British 'Sort Of' equivalent with Michael Caine as Harry Palmer in 'The Ipcress File' (1965) and its sequels, as they came over far more realistically and he wasn't quite so let loose.It was also a very dark film and I don't just mean that it was nasty, but it was almost completely pitch black at times, so it was like - Why Bother if there was nothing to see?And the camera work was very shaky, it didn't add any effect, but made it even more annoying to watch.I was also starting to think that Ron Burgundy* was in charge of the soundtrack with his jazz flute. Because of that I got the impression that they were trying to make it artsy and cool, but it just made it easily dateable in my opinion.I could see why Andrew Robinson was later hired to play Garak in 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine' (1993-9), he was the same kind of freaky as the Cardassian character and perfect in the role of the Killer, which isn't a spoiler, because that was clear from the get go and he was even listed as \"Killer\" on IMDB.Both he and Clint were also better at shooting at the beginning of the film, by the time it got to the end, the shots were going everywhere and far too conveniently.I was also annoyed with the District Attorney, who was surely in error for dismissing the case earlier on? They at least had evidence and could prove that the Killer had beaten and attempted to murder two police officers? If they couldn't get him for the other deaths, then they could have got him for that.But there was no way that the bosses would have allowed Harry to continue to work, even after the first cock up.Overall I found it very flawed, not my thing and quite dull. I suppose that I have been spoiled and seen other films done better since, perhaps they were built on the idea of this one, but they definitely outshone it.343.11/1000.*Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy (2004).",

            "content": "Really there are few words left to describe Dirty Harry and the massive effect it had on world cinema. On the one hand it virtually invented the maverick cop genre and we have it to thank for the slew of pale imitations which followed (notably the Lethal Weapon series) and parodies (such as the brilliant Slegehammer). Clint Eastwood is iconic and fantastic in the role, really the first cop who breaks the rules and enjoys it, the first movie cop to really carry a distinctive handgun (de riguer nowadays), Harry really is a force a nature, not so much a fascist as some would argue but a man who actually cares so much about society and the people that he's prepared to be ruthless to protect them. People see this as a right-wing film but it's not really, Scorpios victims include an Afro-American child and 2 young women, the police are able to save a flamboyantly gay man and a Catholic priest. It was always regarded as 'every frame votes for Nixon' but given his overwhelming election victory during the period it was certainly catching the mood of the times. When the girl gets kidnapped Harry immediately writes her off whilst the Mayor and the police Captain refuse to do so and want to pay the ransom and you're really not sure who's right or wrong? The DA and judge who let Scorpio go do so reluctantly but convincingly argue that we can't introduce evidence in court obtained by torture. Whilst the script ultimately sides with Harry's viewpoint it's not always so black and white as is often assumed.People argue this is a humourless film but I don't think so, the humour is just extremely dark and cutting. Harry just continually seems to be surrounded by people who just don't get him and his constant frustration is just hilarious and played to great comic effect. You do have to wonder if his nickname Dirty Harry is due purely to his methods? He always seems to be looking through naked girl's windows and following Scorpio into strip clubs?Terrific music although not as good as it will be in the arguably superior sequel Magnum Force. Wonderful performance from Andrew Robinson, the child of the free love 60s gone horribly wrong, so nice that Star Trek;DS9 will later give him a career resurgence. Apart from Harry and Scorpio the 2 characters that really stick in your mind are the superbly telegenic city of San Francisco itself and Harry's beloved 44 Magnum, not the most powerful handgun in the world and won't blow your head clean off (although I'd love to see Mythbusters try that)but still packs a hell of a punch. Michael Mann's Heat aside possibly the greatest cop movie ever.",

Believe it, you've never met a more hardened cop, than inspector Harry Callahan. God, if every cop was like Harry, the world would be a much better place. This is Eastwood's best role, the role he was born to play. Dirty Harry has some bloody terrifying moments made that way by the killer nicknamed Scorpio, a brilliant if work of art performance by Andrew Robinson. Saddled with a new out of his depth sick partner Reni Santori, (Pepe in Seinfeld) we see all Harry's pet hates. He's a cop that works alone, and that's just how we like him. This Scorpio killer, a psychopathic sniper, has been making quite a nuisance of himself, and has put the city of SF under siege, threatening to kill someone else, if this ransom is not paid. And you can guess Harry's reaction. And it's up to Harry, to take out this madman permanently. And talk about kicking a killer when he's down in one scene. Another scene has the killer paying someone to have him worked over and transfer the blame on Callahan, who when viewing some photos of the battered maniac, harry defends himself, by saying \"The killer looks too damned good\". The bus scene with Andrew Robinson, really shows his sick, evil, pathetic self come to life. Although this isn't my favourite dirty Harry Movie, with the legendary line, nonetheless, is a solid action thriller, where at the time, would of upset some public, as to the rights of killers, where Death Wish followed two years later. But when it come to ridding scum, and delivering justice, Hey, I'm on Harry's side.",

            "content": "There are a lot of iconic film characters who have single handedly launched franchises: James Bond, Rocky, Indiana Jones, etc. but none are as gracefully done as Inspector Harry Callahan. Other than his .45 Magnum and a little spiel for the criminals that get in his way, there aren't any other gimmicks. Who you see is who you get -- a cop with a moral compass that doesn't let the law set its bearing. He's fast-talking, hard-nosed and merciless -- the cop that everyone wishes they could be but few have the balls to be. He's the model for how a singular character can drive a film.The first step is Clint Eastwood. Known mostly at the time for his Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, Eastwood is a proved one-liner machine gun. He's the got the looks, the poise and the verbal delivery of a certified rebel, a man capable of anything. He makes \"Dirty Harry\" tick. All icons are made by their actors and Eastwood was born to do iconic.Part of what makes \"Dirty Harry\" a classic is that it's a vicarious movie-going experience. Everyone wishes they could just take justice into their own hands just like Callahan. The plot provides that same experience. Harry is a San Francisco detective on the trail of the \"Scorpio Killer,\" a concept ripped straight from the San Francisco Chronicle headlines in the late '60s revolving around the mysterious Zodiac Killer who was on the loose. In a sense, Harry was born out of the country's frustration with the ineptitude of law enforcement in bringing that killer to justice. Harry does to the Scorpio Killer what we all wish we could've done to the Zodiac -- let him have it.An iconic character is also nothing without his lines and a clearly defined set of convictions as indicated in the script. Maybe one of his best lines (of many) is when he describes to some other police how he knew that a man chasing a woman in the street was intent to rape. It perfectly sums up that Harry is a man who doesn't wait to let the law define what's right and wrong. This vision for Harry is guided with strength by Don Siegel. Siegel carefully plans out his critical shots: a long distance zoom-out from the football field as Harry executes his version of justice and a wide shot of Harry above the bridge as he plans to intercept a school bus hijacked by the killer. Siegel creates iconic moments for his truly memorable character and it makes \"Dirty Harry\" a more unforgettable film.",

            "review_title": "A Fascist Fantasy",
            "content": "The title character of \"Dirty Harry,\" Inspector Harry Callahan, is a well-known clich\u00e9 in the movies: a police detective who chafes under all the rules and regulations that get in the way of his catching criminals. In the movie \"Dragnet\" (1954), Officer Frank Smith asks his partner Sergeant Joe Friday why the laws always protect the criminals, to which Friday responds, \"Because the innocent don't need them.\" This attitude is rather widespread, unfortunately. An innocent man, the thinking goes, would never insist on having an attorney present while being interrogated by the police, would never demand to see a warrant before letting the police into his house, and would never plead the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify at his own trial. Only criminals do that sort of thing.For people who think that way, Harry Callahan is their kind of cop, because he never lets something as fussy as a bunch of rights get in the way of catching the bad guys. In one scene in the movie, the district attorney tells Harry he violated several of the suspect's rights, namely the ones embodied in the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Harry says, \"I'm all broken up about that man's rights.\" The district attorney responds that he should be, because the man will have to be released as a result, none of the evidence collected without a warrant being admissible, because that is the law. Harry says, \"Then the law is crazy!\" Harry then asks of the deceased victim, \"And Ann Mary Deacon, what about her rights?\" Thus does Harry give voice to much of the frustration felt by the audience that criminals have rights at the expense of the rights of their innocent victims.The district attorney in that scene refers to the Miranda ruling, which requires that a suspect be informed of his rights to an attorney and the right to remain silent. Before the Miranda ruling it used to be habeas corpus that conservatives hated. In the movie \"Scarface\" (1932), for example, Tony Camonte (Paul Muni) is arrested and then released on what Tony jokingly refers to as a writ of hocus pocus.The circumstance in which Harry violated all that suspect's rights involved torture, and this movie brings out all the necessary conditions for torture to be justified in a movie. When depicted in film, torture is usually portrayed as something evil, something done by Nazis, for instance. But \"Dirty Harry\" is one of the first movies to present torture as being good. Early in the movie, the \"Scorpio Killer\" has buried a little girl alive with only enough oxygen to last her a few hours, and then demands ransom for her release. Harry agrees to deliver the money. When he does, the serial killer announces that he intends to let the little girl die. When Harry catches up with him, he tortures the killer until he tells him where the girl has been buried.Even if we disapprove of torture in real life, we cannot help but approve of Dirty Harry's actions while watching the movie. And this is for five reasons: (1) We are certain the man is guilty. Dirty Harry knows, as do we, that the man he is torturing is the Scorpio Killer. (2) The punishment fits the crime. The Scorpio Killer is evil, and clearly deserves the pain Harry inflicts on him. (3) There is a time element. In just a few hours, the girl will die, so the information must be extracted from him immediately. (4) The situation is ad hoc. Although early in the movie a doctor jokes about Harry beating a confession out of a suspect, it is our sense that he does not routinely torture criminals. (5) The torture is effective. We find out later that the girl was already dead, but Harry does get the information concerning where she is buried.The one condition that no longer seems to be necessary to justify torture in the movies is the fourth one, the requirement that the situation be ad hoc. In the show \"24,\" torture almost seems to be part of Jack Bauer's job description. But the other four conditions obtain. These ideal conditions by which torture is justified are seldom realized in real life. There is typically no time element, sometimes referred to as the \"ticking time bomb.\" Sometimes innocent people are tortured. And the effectiveness of torture is hotly debated. Nevertheless, those who favor torture will often try to justify its use by appealing to movies like \"Dirty Harry\" or shows like \"24,\" as if the ideal circumstances in those dramas were just like those found in real life.A few years before \"Dirty Harry\" was produced, another movie employing a similar type of police detective was \"Madigan\" (1968). Early in the movie, another detective says of the title character (played by Richard Widmark), \"Madigan doesn't always go by the book, but he's a good cop,\" thereby spelling out the clich\u00e9 referred to in the opening paragraph, which is inept, dramatically speaking. Fortunately, \"Dirty Harry\" does not tell us Harry is that kind of cop. It shows us through his words and actions. That is just one of the reasons why \"Dirty Harry\" is a great movie, while \"Madigan\" is just second rate.But it does raise the question, will we ever see a movie about a police detective who never violates a suspect's rights, who never uses undue force, who never enters a suspect's house without a warrant, and who believes that it is more important to obey the law than catch the bad guys, and as a result, the criminals often escape justice? In other words, will we ever see a movie in which someone says, \"Detective Fussbottom is a bad cop, but at least he always goes by the book\"? Probably not, but if we ever do see such a movie, it will have to be a comedy.",

            "content": "This is the first of what was to go on to become five Dirty Harry films. They have now come out in a DVD box set, digitally remastered, so I thought it time to have a rummage through them again. I can hardly believe it was more than forty years ago that Clint Eastwood made DIRTY HARRY. He did not at all look like himself then, in fact he was surprisingly bland and uninteresting at that age. What makes him interesting now is all the character in his face, of which he had little trace back then. Although I bear him a deep grudge because of the way he treated Sondra Locke, I have to admit he is amazingly talented, as witness his directorial work especially (see my reviews). It is interesting in retrospect to consider why this film and its sequels became such a huge hit. The film in itself is very good but nothing to jump up and down with excitement about. Director Don Siegel did an excellent job of trying to make it look as good as he could, and San Francisco is always a plus as a location, as we know, especially when you have got Bruce Surtees as the cinematographer. But the reason why this film 'clicked' is because Eastwood's character Police Inspector Harry Callaghan challenges all the idiotic liberal safeguards for the excessive rights of criminals which ignore the rights of victims. This is one of the most serious dilemmas of our times, more important now than it was in 1971, for this crazy imbalance of 'rights' which is continually perpetuated by all the functionaries who are intent on self-destructing our societies from within hold every criminal precious and dear to their hearts, whereas victims can just get stuffed. Dirty Harry shows his disgust clearly, a disgust already in 1971 held deeply by probably a majority of the American population, and certainly a majority outside the urban conglomerations of the trendy Coasts. (And where in the USA is trendier or more wildly liberal than San Francisco, the setting of this film?) The story plays to this angle by showing a raving psychopathic murderer who is going around shooting people from rooftops, and the San Francisco District Attorney lets him go, after Dirty Harry has caught him and put him in jail, because his 'rights' have been infringed and the rifle he was using to assassinate people in the streets was seized without a warrant. When Eastwood asks what about the rights of the victims not to get killed he is told 'it is the law'. Naturally we all internally cheer when Eastwood resumes his pursuit of the madman in his private time and defies 'orders from the fifth floor'. By the way, in one shot Eastwood is entering a caf\u00e9 and we can see a cinema nearby, which is advertising his own film PLAY MISTY FOR ME. An early example of product placement! It is a good joke, but can only be glimpsed for a moment. Don't production teams like to amuse themselves! This film was the first cinema appearance of Andrew Robinson, who plays the psychopath brilliantly, and who then went on to appear in 103 titles, and there is no record I know of his having murdered anyone since 1971, so, well done Andrew, you have restrained your murderous impulses for four decades! That's true professionalism! This film is entertaining if you don't mind a certain amount of violence. John Vernon is good, as usual, as the Mayor of San Francisco, but then he wants to let the bad guys out of jail too. I thought Ruth Kobart was very good as a terrified elderly driver of a hijacked school bus with the amusing name of Priscilla Platt. It takes a lot of talent to look that terrified when you are just sitting at a steering wheel and when your character is called Priscilla Platt. Some of the school children get slapped around pretty badly by the psychopath, so sensitive people will not find this film easy watching in places. The clever ruse the psychopath uses to try to discredit Eastwood by pretending Eastwood beat him to a pulp, namely by paying someone else $200 to beat him to a pulp so that he can pretend it was done by Eastwood, is one of the most shocking aspects of the film. Never trust a psychopath, that's my motto, which is why it is so difficult to cast a vote sometimes.",

            "content": "Very few stars from the golden age of television and film survived into the Reagan era the way that Clint Eastwood did. If you're looking for reasons, the answer is in \"Dirty Harry\" and its reactionary message of hatred for the counter-culture. Unlike the fine docudrama, \"Helter Skelter,\" \"Dirty Harry\" doesn't go into character in any depth, preferring to create hateful paper thin stereotypes for the bigots in the audience, regardless of whether they hate left wingers, liberals or cops.Ironically, this exploitation film must have appealed very much to the unofficial censors in Washington, D.C. who later gave birth to the influential media lobbying groups which turned Hollywood into a propaganda organ of the political right wing with such movies as \"Missing in Action\" and \"Rambo II.\" The miraculous success of Eastwood's career since this mediocre movie was made shows how adopting a right wing approach confers a competitive advantage in politically reactionary times. By the late 80's his movies were showing all the time on broadcast TV, but hardly anyone else who got started in the golden age received any air time at all. Because there were so many stars more talented than Eastwood who got started in the golden age around the same time -- Clint Walker, Tony Franciosa and Nick Adams, just to name a very few -- it's reasonable to wonder if there wasn't an anti-left wing black list in Hollywood and Washington beginning in the early 70's, which favored reactionaries like Eastwood over the more talented competition. Nonetheless, I'm sort of a reluctant fan. It's too late now, but instead of \"Dirty Harry\" I wish that Eastwood had appeared in a movie version of \"A Cool Million,\" from the novel by Nathanael West -- a satire on the subject of homegrown American style right wing totalitarianism. The part of Lemuel Pitkin, the boneheaded leader of the buckskin shirted fascists, would have been perfect for him and a real challenge to his acting ability!",

            "content": "Inspector 'Dirty Harry' Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is assigned to one of his toughest cases when he finds himself having to track down a notorious serial killer simply known as Scorpio. Scorpio leaves a letter at the scene of his first crime threatening to kill again unless he receives $100,000. What follows is a cat and mouse game between Scorpio and Harry but in this game Harry is determined to win and will do whatever it takes to bring Scorpio to justice.Between 1971 and 2016 there have been many cop type films and over the years we have seen many similar 'Harry Callahan' type police officers being portrayed on film. However, Dirty Harry was a very early example of a bad-ass cop who's prepared to bend or break the rules in order to get his man but, to my knowledge, no film has ever given us a cop who's quite so iconic and cool as Dirty Harry Callahan. Part of the reason this film succeeds lies with Eastwood himself and what he brought to the role; there's nobody else quite like him when it comes to tough-talking through gritted teeth and he's also capable of giving icy stares that at times can be quite unnerving. I think the important distinction to make with Harry is that he's a 'bad-ass' cop rather than a 'bad' cop; he isn't afraid to break the rules in order to do what he feels is right, but he also knows when to hold back and never allows his judgement to be clouded even in the most extreme of circumstances. For these reasons it's easy to have a vested interest in Callahan's dogged pursuit of Scorpio as more often than not we find a police officer doing a lot of things wrong but for all the right reasons. Of course every 'bad-ass' cop needs a bad-ass villain to contend with and this is where Andrew Robinson comes into play; Robinson was not a big actor (and sadly never seemed to become one either) and therefore going up against Eastwood (who was quite well-established at this point in his career) must have been quite a daunting task, but Robinson acquits himself to the role very well and manages to be chilling, menacing and ever so slightly sociopathic. According to the trivia section Robinson received death threats after his performance in Dirty Harry which just goes to show that a lot of people were so convinced by his performance that they must have forgot that he was acting!!!Director Don Siegel gives the film plenty of energy and keeps the film moving at a fair old lick; the screenplay also includes some humorous moments (I loved the unorthodox approach that Harry used to try to prevent someone from jumping off a high-rise building). Harry's general contempt for authority made many of his scenes with The Mayor and The Chief very enjoyable. To top it all off Dirty Harry also has a very exciting finale with one of the best closing lines to a film that I've ever seen.Anyone who is a fan of Eastwood really should watch this as not only is this one of his best films but he's also playing one of the best characters to grace the cinema screen (I genuinely can't think of a cooler character than Harry Callahan). Many cop films with similar bad-ass cops have followed, but few (if any) have been as good as Dirty Harry.",

            "content": "It spawned four sequels and countless imitators, redefined a genre, brought in millions at the box office, and was both hailed as one of the best action movies in years and derided as fascist propaganda. It provided a major boost to the already red-hot career of its star Clint Eastwood. It introduced one of Hollywood's most iconic heroes and baddest bad guys. Forty years later people still quote lines from this movie- including some that weren't in it. There is no doubt that Dirty Harry is one of the most influential movies of the seventies, and one of the all time great cop movies.Eastwood stars as Inspector Harry Callahan, the original cop who doesn't play by the rules. He has no time to worry about proper procedure, isn't particularly careful about following orders, and makes no effort to be likable. He pulls no punches, doesn't care who he offends, and he keeps his job because there isn't a man on the force with sharper aim, better instincts, or harder stones than him. He may not make many friends, but he gets the job done. But he faces the toughest job of his career, taking down the mysterious sniper known as Scorpio. Scorpio is every cop's nightmare. He's driven, intelligent, and completely insane, with a sadistic streak a mile wide. He delights in causing pain, kills for the sheer fun of it, and is always one step ahead of the police. He's not picky about who he kills, but can meticulously his crimes days in advance. And he loves to make the city of San Francisco play his games. He reminds me more than a bit of Heath Ledger's Joker, who he may have been an influence on, and there are some chilling parallels to the DC snipers.Admittedly, many parts of the film seem clich\u00e9d by today's standards, from the rookie partner to the superiors who constantly make the wrong decision and call the hero out on the carpet. But this movie is the reason they became clich\u00e9s. And there are parts that are brilliantly original, like the telephone chase in the middle. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. The pacing is excellent as well, with long periods of tension leading to explosive action scenes, with the best being saved for last.I give the director and cinematographer high marks for the camera work, including sudden close-ups, long panning shots, and extensive use of first person view. They've also made very good use of their locations, and really captured San Francisco, both the glamorous (downtown, the Golden Gate), and the seedy (liquor stores, topless bars, gay druggies in the park).Now Harry Callahan was and is a controversial figure, both within the film, and among social commentators, though not as much so as back in the seventies. He's a constant headache for the DA and public affairs, and in real life he'd probably spend half his time on suspension. I admit his knowledge of, and regard for, the rules of evidence and the rights of the accused are pretty low, even for a movie cop. I can't help but sympathize with him though. If I saw a naked, knife-wielding man chasing a woman down an alley, I'd shoot to kill. I'd also look for ways getting around the search warrant requirement if I knew that a fourteen year old girl's life depended on finding the perp. But it's also clear that he did go too far in apprehending Scorpio at the football stadium. Busting into the grounds keeper's hut without a warrant is excusable, same for skipping the Miranda rights. But there was no excuse for a police officer beating a wounded suspect, especially on the area of the wound. If this were a war movie or a private eye film he could get away with it, but for a cop it's just too far. This also leads to the one point where suspension of disbelief becomes impossible. I cannot believe that a police department, even in San Francisco, would just let the suspect walk. No matter how badly his rights had been violated, they would still find some technicality to hold him on. And they would certainly keep him under constant surveillance if he were released.These issues aside, Dirty Harry is still a solid thriller, and excellent 'guy' movie, and one of the best cop dramas ever made. Don't let the kiddies see it, but if you're high school age or older it's definitely worth checking out.",

            "content": "When a deranged sniper picks victims at random and personally taunts the San Francisco police department, he draws the ire of the grumpiest cop on the force. Harry Callahan, played with typical take-no-prisoners panache by Clint Eastwood, isn't here to make friends or to feel good about himself. He exists solely to conduct court on the streets, rulebook be damned; to shoot first and ask questions later. Presumably because the weapon he carries, an iconic, big-barreled Smith & Wesson, doesn't leave enough of its target to raise any objections.Although everyone clearly despises him on a personal level, it's hard to see Harry positioned as anything but the banner-waving antihero: he gets to spout the sweet quotes, wear the cool sunglasses and strike a bunch of badass poses, so his opinions become the film's opinions. That's a problem when the themes grow more ambitious, addressing the shaky ground between what's legal and what's arbitrarily \"right.\" Harry sees everything in stark black-and-white, flying into a seething rage when a high-profile collar walks free due to his own brutish interrogation tactics, and we're meant to cheer when he stalks and eventually forces a second confrontation with the freed criminal. The pursuit itself makes for gripping entertainment - messy, gritty and intense - but the overt political messaging makes it more complicated than a simple yay-rah get-the-bad-guy.The film uses its antagonist, the aforementioned sniper, as incendiary proof of the holes in the justice system. If more situations were handled outside the courtroom, I guess, we'd see far fewer hijacked school buses or tortured kids. Odd that the fallacy of this argument is lost on Harry, who's earlier beaten to a bloody pulp by three yokels. Believing what they see, and refusing to wait for the whole story, they jump to conclusions and take him for a peeping Tom. Harry licks his wounds and carries on, blissfully unaware of the poetic irony.This isn't just your basic gunsmoke action movie. I might not agree with its conclusions, but I appreciate the debate it inspired within me. It's always good to test one's own beliefs. Also good to soak up a healthy dose of raw '70s atmosphere from time to time, which is something Dirty Harry has in spades.",

            "content": "Feel sorry for Inspector Harry Callahan. Not only does he have to abide by pesky laws and procedures, and not only is the Mayor a damned coward, but his new partner studied sociology. In other words, he's the sort of man who actually tries to understand criminal behaviour and fix society's problems with rational thought and all that jazz. But for Harry, what's there to understand? Criminals are damned punks. A bullet in the head is true justice.And there are so many criminals about. Just take the list of dead police officers that opens the film. All of them were killed by damned punks, and those damned pussies at city hall seem to be encouraging them. No wonder a guy like Harry is disillusioned.Of course, in the real world, a guy like Harry Callahan would be a liability. I mean, no one is right all the time, and when Harry thinks he's right, he has no qualms about shooting suspects and torturing them. But hey, this is a movie, and therefore Harry is always right. Consequently his fascism is just a committed cop doing what it takes to get results. We love every moment of it.I guess it helps that his adversary is off his nut. Really, is there anyone quite so mental as Scorpio? I don't think there is. He makes Tom Cruise look like he has all his faculties.My favourite Scorpio bit is the Scorpio scream when Harry stabs him in the leg. Words fail to describe the hilarity and the insane beauty of the sound, but if I were to try, I'd say it sounded like the sound a man would make if he were mounted by an overly friendly horse. But in the same scene there's the brilliant moment when Scorpio beats Harry up. Wearing a lurid orange ski mask, and staring at him with deranged eyes, he shouts, \"Do we understand each other?\" It's so crazy it's almost beautiful.Also rather beautiful is the way Harry captures Scorpio. He chases him through a football stadium and on the pitch he orders Scorpio to stop, which he does. Then he shoots him in the leg, which leads to more Scorpio screaming. At this point it seems like the scene can't get any better, but then Scorpio starts pleading like a little girl. \"You tried to kill me\u0085I want a lawyer\u0085I have the right to a lawyer.\" And then Harry treads on Scorpio's wound and you have a fantastic helicopter shot from Harry and Scorpio on the football pitch to a view high above, almost a god's eye view. And if god did exist, I'm sure he'd approve. I know I do. Well, only because I know with 100% certainty that Harry is right.But those damned liberals at city hall don't approve of Harry's methods, so Scorpio gets released. I mean, Harry only performed an illegal search and violated a man's rights. What's the problem? But insanely dedicated cop that he is (in other words, he doesn't have a life of his own), Harry follows Scorpio around during his spare time. And classy fellow that he is, Scorpio spends plenty of time in titty bars. But Scorpio soon tires of being trailed, and in a magnificent scene, pays a large black man to beat him up, framing it on Harry (I love how mangled Scorpio's face is when he insults the large man that is beating him up; and I love how severe the beating is). But do you see what happens when you give people rights? They use their devious minds to turn everything around. Wouldn't the word be a much better place if cops were at liberty to blow heads clean off? Mayors and stupid chiefs, and laws and regulations only hinder good ole cops like Harry.And just look at what happens when someone like Scorpio is left on the street. He shoots people with his snipers rifle and he robs shopkeepers. And the shop scene may well be my favourite in the film \u0096 although it would compete with the scene where Harry deals with the jumper (he insults him, makes him mad and then punches him out; now that's policing!) But in the shop scene, Scorpio chats to the owner about how many times he's been robbed. The owner blathers for a bit and shows him his gun. To which Scorpio meekly says, \"Please, I scare easy.\" But then as the man is putting his gun away, Scorpio smashes a bottle over his head (while still in its paper bag) and robs the bloke. How can you hate a man that's so ingenious? And how can you hate a man who pleads like a dog, screams like a girl and wants to kill Catholic priests? See, he's not all bad.Plus he's great with children. There he is singing with them and having a good old time. Sure he slaps them about a bit and tells them that he's going to kill their mothers, but children need a bit of discipline, don't they? But Harry soon puts a stop to this. Like The Terminator he jumps off a bridge, lands on top of the bus and after a bit of a shoot-out, kills Scorpio. Then he throws his badge away. It would be an ending with some symbolic meaning if Callahan hadn't returned for so many sequels. But as it is, Dirty Harry is a shallow, wafer-thin detective film that's a hell of a lot of fun. I mean, there's almost zero character development (Harry's wife is dead and that's that; and Scorpio is just loco), but that doesn't stop it from being an enjoyable ride. Just the Scorpio scream on its own would make it worthwhile, but on top of that you have a fascist cop blowing people away with his large gun. And surely that's enough for anyone.",

I am left-wing, in my opinion the Clintons and Al Gore belong to moderate right. And I don't see any \"fascism\" in \"Dirty Harry\". I only see an important political problem, important 35 years ago and as important in our days - think of the Twin Towers assault.The idea of maximal freedom for the individual is very attractive. The snag is of course, that there are some evil human creatures around abusing this freedom. It is possible to close your eyes and not think about it of course. But if you are honest, you have to. The first thing \"Dirty Harry\" makes clear, is that liberals and socialists have to pay a price. I think civil rights are absolute, the idea to restrict them in favour of safety/security is wrong. In The Netherlands Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh have paid with their lives, like the two girls killed by Scorpio.So is Harry Callahan right? Of course not. Don Siegel and Clint Eastwood portray him on purpose as a racist and a loose canon. Just ask a random police officer, if he wants to work with a guy like Callahan. The final scene is symbolic: Callahan does not belong in the police corps and he knows it. If you are right wing, ask yourself some questions. With your son or daughter in the bus - or even better: if that fishing kid were your son - would you want Callahan taking those risks? Here we see the only, but a big fault of the movie: when Callahan shoots Scorpio in the shoulder, the kid should have been killed. But I suppose, that would be too shocking. It would have been reality though.Harry Callahan himself also pays a high price. He has does not have a family life. Ask some policemen; the doubts of Gonzales' wife are very real. Callahan does not have friends. Also notice, that Callahan's sex life consists of peeping. One of his partners has been killed; the other is in hospital, where Gonzales ends as well.All you right wing people, can you honestly say, that it is worth taking these risks? Especially, when your family, friends and relatives are involved? Dirty Harry Callahan has a strong right wing political view. The movie has not. Essential is the scene, when Gonzales asks his superior, if it is right not to give Callahan a cover up. Lieutenant Bessler's answer is honest: he does not know. No matter your political views, you need blinkers to answer Gonzales' question.This is exactly, why \"Dirty Harry\" is superior to all the other tough cops movies, with types like Bronson, Gibson, Willis and Segal. \"Dirty Harry\" is unsettling, because it leaves the spectator without answers. This is underlined by the fact, that regular police surveillance in the movie saves two lives ...Two final remarks. Nobody has noticed the similarities between Scorpio and El Indio. I only mention them, as they are obvious. Andy Robinson is great, but I think Gian Maria Volonte even more frightening. I also find it amazing, that so many people think \"Dirty Harry\" violent. Please, do a body count and compare with hard boiled movies since 1980 until today. The fact is of course, that there are not that many victims. The good guys get hurt as well. Neither is there any beauty in the violent scenes. Violence is portrayed like it is in reality: nasty, dirty, painful. It is present, today even more than in 1971, and there is no good way to deal with it.",

Remove Eastwood, have someone else play the title character, and you've got just another early 70's cop thriller. I watched it the other day for, I think, the first time since it came out. It was quite a shock, seeing Clint with enough hair for three people. I was also surprised at how graphic the violence and nudity was for a 'mainstream' film from 1971; it must have been just this side of an 'X' rating at the time. But aside from that, it was the same Clint Eastwood we've been watching for fifty years. Nobody else plays the super-cool cop/gunslinger/secret service agent/whatever in quite the same way. Nobody else would make it seem so believable. Part of it has to with the character's basic contrariness, part of it's being the 'strong, silent type' because the character is always a man of few words. But he's not infallible, like some heroes. The trick that Eastwood pulls off that almost no one else can is that he's badass cool even when he's screwing up or getting the hell beat out of him. He's not afraid to play the fool and make mistakes. There's something about the persona he projects that keeps us from thinking he's a dumbass. It's not just an 'I don't give a damn' attitude on his part, it's that combined with an underlying self-respect and code of honor. It's more of a 'I don't give a damn what other people think because I know what's right' attitude, and it always shows through. Eastwood had already established the basic character in the 'spaghetti westerns' of the sixties. But in 1971 under the auspices of his own newly-formed Malpaso Productions, he brought a somewhat more talkative variation to the screen as Harry Callahan of the San Francisco police. (Hey, Los Angeles has Joe Friday and San Fran has Dirty Harry.) The thriller about a go-his-own-way cop was a huge hit and trendsetter; imitations have come out on a yearly basis ever since, not to mention four Dirty Harry sequels. The original focuses on the Scorpio killer and it set the tone for the others; there were, if not exactly running gags, recurring situations, such as Harry constantly being questioned by his superiors and others about his violent tendencies and Harry essentially telling them to shove it. For example, the first film contains the quintessential Dirty Harry line of dialogue (parodied in 'Police Squad!' by Leslie Nielsen and elsewhere). When told what the police department's policy regarding use of force is, Harry responds, \"When an adult male is chasing a female with intent to commit rape, I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.\" The mayor is forced to concede, \"I think he's got a point.\"",

This voyeurism is especially evident in the opening scene with respect to the serial killer. Later in the movie we discover also touches of voyeurism in main character Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood).There are two things that striked me in \"Dirty Harry\".In the first place in \"Dirty Harry\" Harry has to collaborate with his younger, less experienced but higher educated colleague Chico Gonzales (Reni Santoni). There are more films with such duo's, for example \"Mississippi burning\" (1988, Alan Parker) and \"Seven\" (1995, David Fincher). Most of the time they grow towards each other in the course of the film. Not in \"Dirty Harry\".In the second place Harry, as a streetwise cop, has frequent conflicts with his bosses. The cops priority is catching crimonals in every possible way, the priority of the bosses also extends to the bureaucracy of the organisation. Normally the sympathy lies with the cop, but in \"Dirty Harry\" there grows some doubt during the film. You don't want too many cops like Harry walking down the streets. His goals may be different from that of the serial killer, emotionally there are some similarities. Think of the remark about voyeurism I made earlier in this review.At the end of the film Harry kills the serial killer but also throws his police badge away. Maybe he came to his own conclusion about his fitness for the job. By the way, throwing his badge away did not preclude many sequels to come.",

            "content": "It's hard to really gauge the impact of Dirty Harry today. Clint Eastwood took his iconic Man With No Name character from the three spaghetti westerns of the 60s,gave him a few tweaks and then placed him in modern day San Francisco,in the process creating another iconic character for audiences to cheer and critics to get steamed up about. Here was a cop who sometimes seemed as brutal as the villains he battled,yet who still lived by his own very moral code. Since this film's release,and especially during the 1980s,the cinema has been filled with tough cop heroes who get the job done by whatever means necessary and are always being told off by exasperated bosses. However,Harry came first.As a film Dirty Harry has possibly lost a little of it's edge now because many subsequent similar films have been much more action packed and violent,the action scenes in this film are fairly quick and to the point-no extended shoot outs here. However,it still has incredible tension. The plot is extremely simple-Harry versus a nasty sniper called Scorpio,that's it-and all the better for it. Director Don Siegel,aided by Lalo Schifrin's funky and sometimes chilling score {the music as Scorpio prepares to shoot people is particularly menacing} piles on the suspense with the skill of a master {possibly the only film he made which bettered this one was the original Invasion Of Th Body Snatchers}.Siegel is especially good with the scenes of violence. In one scene,Harry basically tortures Scorpio for the whereabouts of a girl he is kidnapped. As Harry places his foot on Scorpio's wound and the music goes all wild and dissonant,the camera pans up from the action very quickly until Harry and Scorpio are specks. No real gloating on the brutality,but maximum impact.Harry Robinson's Scorpio is one of the most terrifying villains ever,especially when he manically laughs as he beats up Harry and says about his prisoner \"you know what,I'm going to let her die. I just wanted you to know that\". Clint has rarely been more effective,subsequent films would develop Harry's character a bit,but he never had the edge and sheer cool as he had here,check out his opening entrance as he checks out a crime scene whilst chewing gum. The writers and Eastwood realise a certain amount of humour about the character without losing his credibility {listen out for the \"adult male with a butcher knife\" line}.This has been called a fascist movie,but if it is than why did audiences respond so much to the film and the character of Harry? In truth,people related to Harry's anger at a criminal system that sometimes seemed to favour the criminals and there is always a certain pleasure in seeing nasty folk being wiped out. Watch the afore mentioned scene where Harry tortures Scorpio,and see if you're not with Harry a bit and share his concern for the kidnapped girl. Perhaps some of the sequels had more interesting plots and situations and had more action,but Dirty Harry remains a terrific pared-to-the-bone thriller which is still extremely gripping.",

            "content": "\"Dirty Harry\" is an important film for several reasons, including the remaking of its star, Clint Eastwood, into a first-rank \"modern-day\" action star of American cinema; the development of a grittier-style cop drama for which DH remains the standard today; and as the first unmistakable sign, by virtue of its popularity, of a significant public turning against the counter-culture that was feeding much of the content from Hollywood by this time.People may point to \"Patton\" the year before, but that film retained a certain disapproving detachment from its protagonist. \"Dirty Harry\" is presented as our hero, plain and simple, Miranda and Escovito be damned. So effectively did Eastwood play this character that he spent four sequels apologizing for him by putting Harry up against right-wing extremists and interracial gangs while partnering with a Rainbow Coalition of enlightening partners, including the actor who played the poor bank robber he torments with his \"six shots or fives\" line near the beginning of the film.It's probably the only way to have kept the franchise going, because the original Harry would have been tough sledding after a while, but there's no denying that power he had his first time out was something neither he nor any other movie cop ever had again. There's a couple of scenes that bring it home, one when he confronts the DA who refuses to prosecute Scorpio (\"I'm all broken up about his rights,\" Harry says) and the other where Harry waits for Scorpio alone at the end, gun drawn, all business, while the rest of the law-enforcement community plays the game.The film does try to show us that Harry's heart is in the right place, that while he doesn't mind being seen as a racist he really isn't one. After he blows away three bank robbers, all black, we get to see him being worked on by an African-American doctor who's an old friend. The scummy lead villain, and a great one as played by Andy Robinson, is a baby-faced white boy who doesn't like hippies any more than Harry (less, actually, since Harry isn't aiming a rifle at them).There's one stupid scene, the one involving the jumper, which is sloppy-edited and lazily thought-out. Harry doesn't seem the guy for the job, know what I mean? Otherwise, Don Siegel is brilliant putting Harry through his paces, and the result is even better than \"Bullitt\" for my money. The subway scene goes on for a while, but it's shot very well, superbly interplaying shadow and sound as our eyes stretch across corners hunting for the killer. I think the music makes an important contribution as well, here and elsewhere.People still debate whether Siegel's earlier \"Invasion Of The Body Snatchers\" was right-wing anti-communism or left-wing criticism of same. No question what colors he was flying here, but this is one case where not playing it subtle was the way to go.",

Cowardly, terrifying, human and yet emotionless, he is devoted to the part for every second and is a true portrait of the serial killer. A resounding scream of defiance to all the liberal attitudes of the sixties, Dirty Harry is a product of modern society, but unlike Death Wish the film doesn't want to stand up and celebrate him, only show how he is a necessary evil.",

But also the sincerity in the portrayal of the cynical character is something that today's audience seldom see in new movies. Or perhaps I am just watching the wrong movies? Either way, I consider this as a positive quality for the film. There's no winks to the audience.But the film does feel dated in certain aspects. I think it's harder to like the Harry character today than it was back then, as the values he stands for are not really the one we aspire to today. But seen as a movie set in the era it was made, it still works. And had Harry not been Dirty Harry, the movie probably wouldn't have worked at all. The plot itself is interesting enough, but it's Clint Eastwood's performance that makes this movie last.And Clint Eastwood kills it. This movie was definitely made in his prime.",

Many filmmakers and actors of the action film genre have paid their tribute to this film and its titular character; preserving its four decade long legacy. However, the film is overlooked for its visual storytelling. Not that it uses any groundbreaking shots and editing techniques, but the film has the precise aesthetic quality of a low budget thriller. One of the most memorable shots in the film was the overhead zoom out of Harry torturing the Scorpio killer in the foggy Kezar Stadium with Lalo Schifrin's jazzy score effectively conveying the bleak tone of the scene and shot. This kind of aesthetic detail in a low budget cop thriller (let alone an action film) doesn't get enough credit from film goers and critics. Another overlooked quality are the performances. Clint Eastwood effectively adapts his already established western hero persona in a contemporary setting. Andy Robinson's chilling performance (that certainly traumatized me when I first watched this film at the age of ten) as the Scorpio Killer paved the way for the hyperbolically insane villains that have become a staple in that film genre. The screenplay has the lean pacing of a thriller, but is cleverly written with dialog that is just as lean and to the point. Personally, the perfect American action film has the raw aesthetic quality, with a lean script, and naturally great performances. Dirty Harry fulfills those requirements successfully.",

I am all for free speech but as it is stated in the Bill of Rights where the first ten amendments are located, free speech is only applicable when it does not infringe and , or take away from the rights of others. It is in this that Dirty Harry rises. It shows that if you are a murdering coward you should be punished. I love when Harry throws away his badge at the end of the movie showing that he is tired of the sickness that is all through out the corrupt system of police and it's over long litigation process. This film is at it's best when it showcases the hunt and the lengths to which Clint Eastwood's character will go to avenge peoples rights. This is best stated when Harry's superior officer tell him the Scorpio Killer has rights and that Callahan infringed on this rights. With that said Eastwood's brilliant character replies back in a satirical manner \"I'm all broken up about that mans rights!\" That is what this film stands for, too many bureaucrats allow criminals to roam the streets while they worry about falsely criminalizing people who can't afford insurance, or a place to live. These people go to jail while your local town maniac sits on his couch waiting for his next fool moon murder. Come on, we need Dirty Harry back on the case.",

It's a remarkably intelligent film with some outstanding acting and writing, but the director Don Siegel steals the show with some absolutely brilliant use of the widescreen format. Honestly, when you watch \"Dirty Harry\" you wonder why so many average directors out there don't even seem to care about things like composition. The score by Lalo Schifrin is terrific as well.The film does have its problems, of course, but for the most part they come in the form of little moments and scenes that don't fit (\"I want my mother!\"). By and large this film is a tremendously entertaining thriller and one with a lot on its mind. It's not dumb entertainment by any measure, and I don't think you have to agree with Harry's politics to appreciate the film (I'm left-leaning, although I would have had to restrain myself if given the chance to kill the evil bastard of a villain this movie had).Not Siegel's best movie, but a quality thriller nonetheless, and far from shallow.

            "content": "Warner Brothers is set to release the Dirty Harry Ultimate Collector's Edition so I paid respectful tribute to their cash grab by borrowing an old 4:3 version of Don Siegel's genre defining, tough as nails cop movie. What I loved about my version was how it looked like old TV reruns from the 70's: faded, scratchy, well-worn...and dirty. I'm sure the new widescreen, digitally remastered version looks sparkling by comparison, but who wants to watch a gritty film with all the grit buffed out? I want my Dirty Harry filthy.The movie itself is pretty much what you'd expect if you've never seen it or (like me) haven't watched it in a very long time. The crooks are scumbags, the bureaucrats are pussies and the law is the blast shield these weasels all hide behind. Enter Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his best (and only) friend Mr. 44 Magnum (Smith & Wesson). When Harry is finished, this same blast shield resembles a splintered, bloodied and hollowed out exit wound to the back of a human skull. Early on, Harry, gun extended, asks a wounded bank robber: \"I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?\" Immortal words. As far as characters go, there's not a lot of depth to Harry. We get the hint his wife has been killed and that no one on the police force really likes him, they simply fear him. Harry is ice cold, trigger happy, racist, misanthropic, cynical and is incapable of spelling due process, let alone defining it. In other words, this guy embodies the typical American in the early 1970's, a collective soured by the senseless carnage of the Vietnam War. In fact, Harry is a right winger's wet dream where the crooks are corpses long before they get a chance to beg for \"habeas corpus.\" I suppose in many ways, Harry embodies what the typical right-wing American wishes they could have done to the Viet Cong: blow em' away and put an end to this mess. But sadly, this is a movie and, wish fulfillment aside, things in the USA would get far worse (mounting Vietnam casualties and Watergate) before they would get better. In the end, Harry's six gun justice leaves him as disillusioned at the end as he was at the beginning and aside from some blood lust being served, the audience has to ask the same questions they must have been asking about the Vietnam War: Why?What is refreshing about watching a movie like DH today is its disdain for political correctness and its balls out ability to show society as a cesspool in need of a good scrubbing. They don't make movies like this anymore and I'm shocked they don't considering how easily the Neo-Cons have made Watergate seem like a petty political prank and how Iraq is fast becoming our generation's Vietnam. The truth is, we could use a revamped and retooled version of Dirty Harry. Maybe this time around he could be a blood thirsty Secret Service Agent who snaps and goes on a rampage in the oval office.

The movie never lets up and is filled with witty dialogue and thrilling action. The two leads are both very convincing in their roles and the psychedelic 70's music is excellent. One of the best scenes has Harry foil a bank robbery (by shooting most of 'em) while calmly finishing his hot dog and at the end, delivers the famous \"Do you feel lucky, punk?\" lines to a wounded robber whose shotgun lies just a foot away.

It achieves this narrative fully with original characters and performances, as well as the clever and exciting way the killer sets Harry up to get the ransom. The vicious clash of this villain and well, hero, is not forgettable.\nThe cinematography was involving, appropriate and solid. The film grain looked beautiful. I felt 1971 all over. And there was an impressive helicopter shot from the football stadium out. Locations were sweet, good choices of San Francisco. The weak points in the film are in some of the dialogue feeling rather conscious of what a badass Clint is playing, like when he say, \"Now you know why they call me Dirty Harry, because I do every dirty job that comes around.\" Pretty playful, I just felt it was trying to be a little too tough.

For example Scorpio at first demands the 'massive' sum of $100,000!The cars look massive almost as bushy as Eastwoods hairstyle.I sometimes wonder if a more right wing method of law enforcement would lower the crime rate (minus blowing people's heads off of course!)That reminds me. The film is best known for one of Callahans phrases that he uses twice in this film. The \"Do you feel lucky, punk\" speech. Actually Callahan is armed with a .44 Magnum firearm. The most powerful hangun in the world at the time.It apparently could blow your head clean off. If faced with its barrel pointing at you, you've got to ask yourself one question surely.

            "content": "\"You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?\" -- Harry Callahan, DIRTY HARRY.And a screen icon is scarred onto the face of filmdom. And the Earth is once again salted with the man-nectar of masculinity.DIRTY HARRY is about a cop who takes the law into his own hands. That's the simple synopsis. But the cultural impact of this film and Clint Eastwood's most enduring character is indescribable.Beyond the art of movies, beyond the rubric of cops and robbers, beyond the playground where good and evil frolic hand in hand, \"Dirty Harry\" has entered the lexicon as shorthand for righteous brutality, masculine justice, and not taking crap; the film DIRTY HARRY spawned innumerable \"loose cannon\" cop films (which was a misapprehension of its actual theme) and a more disturbing level of violence in movies; DIRTY HARRY took the anti-authority hippie stance of the 60s to the next level of societal angst in the newly-minted '70s.Amidst the furor over an unwinnable war (times just don't change, do they?) American aggression found catharsis in DIRTY HARRY. Simplistically, the movie advocates violence against those who spawn violence (two wrongs making a right), seemingly advocating personal vigilantism over the dinosaurian \"justice system\"; yet the real message was too subtle for American audiences, who prove themselves time and again too blunt to comprehend subtlety. As Clint himself espouses, \"It's not about a man who stands for violence. It's about a man who can't understand society tolerating violence.\" And Clint Eastwood should know. He IS Dirty Harry.In a role intended for Sinatra, Eastwood owned Detective Harry Callahan like Sinatra owned \"My Way.\" After we meet alpha male Harry as an edgy maverick San Francisco cop who \"doesn't play any favorites! Harry hates everybody\" he is teamed with a young Mexican Inspector, Chico (Reni Santoni) and soon on the trail of a psycho sniper killer, Scorpio (Andy Robinson, who would never again command a role so hallucinogenically ruthless and tasty).The subtext is that Scorpio is Harry on the wrong side of the law (As Above, So Below; the devil is god inverted). He hates minorities too and demands a ransom from the city of San Francisco in return for not shooting a homosexual or a catholic priest (nowadays that's the same thing).There are the authority figures stultifying Harry's methods, then castigating him with legal technicalities when he gets the job done (John Vernon as the Mayor and Josef Sommer as the D.A.). And there is the first pairing of Eastwood with the ever-frazzled Harry Guardino as his Lieutenant.Author Richard Schickel defines that moment a star becomes a superstar - the scene that establishes why Harry is Dirty, shooting down bank robbers while still chewing a hot dog.From a diner, Harry spies a car idling outside a bank. Not wanting to interrupt his break, he instructs the chef to call in a robbery in progress. As Harry takes the first bite of his hot dog, alarms start clamoring, and he resignedly drops the dog and exits the diner, still chewing on the bite. And drawing his big gun. He sees an armed robber exiting the bank (Albert Popwell in the first of his four roles in Dirty Harry movies) and yells, \"Halt!\" mid-chew. The robber fires on Harry; Harry fires back, sending the robber sprawling. The getaway car careens at Harry, who calmly takes aim and shoots it, sending it crashing into a fire hydrant, which jets water like a carnival.And now, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: Harry saunters to the downed robber - still chewing - and calmly points his gun at him, the robber looking tentatively at his own gun on the ground, inches from him. And Harry speaks: \"I know what you're thinking. 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?\" The milk of Legend.The robber declines the challenge, yet when Harry turns to walk away, the robber beseeches him, \"Hey!... I gots to know.\" The milk of hilarity.By now Harry has morphed into a composite of Clint/Harry, as he smugly points his Magnum at the flinching robber - and pulls the trigger! Click! Empty barrels! Harry smiles that Eastwood smile and saunters away.By now we are overdosing on Legend...While his mythos as a laconic avenger was birthed with Leone's DOLLAR trilogy, the DIRTY HARRY movies rounded out this more \"modern\" Clint. And if Leone was responsible for carving Clint into Legend, the director of this cinematic juggernaut was the other man who \"made\" Eastwood: Don Siegel.The finale is the cement that hardens the Legend. Harry points his Magnum at Scorpio, who is shielding himself with a boy. In a classic callback, Harry recites the same monologue he gave to the bank robber - but this time the tone is taut disdain, a mocking death knell for the person whom it is addressed to. And the funny thing is: during Harry's first speech, he is out of ammo, during his second, he has one bullet left - yet the circumstances make him a winner both times.In Clint's Magnum opus we know that Harry Callahan stands for what is truly right - over and above any written law cravenly passed by sniveling old rich white guys who rape justice in the ass. The funny thing is: when you yourself come up against morally ambiguous situations in life, you look to someone like Harry Callahan to guide you. And you gotta ask yourself a question, \"Do you feel Dirty?\" Well, do ya, punk?!",

            "content": "There are mountains of praise for Dirty Harry, and all of them are deserved. But one thing that gets me is the justification of freeing Scorpio for the third act that comes off as pure propaganda: would any police department really free someone in a mask who shot at them so freely? The story swerves into a bit of disbelief when Scorpio, after injuring a few police officers and is in turn injured, is suddenly let go after being shot in the leg. To add insult to injury, the whole thing is turned into a right-wing nonsensefest where Harry goes on about victim's right (a valid concern) but is shot down by the personification of a smug liberal (from Berkeley, no less!) simply to get us to the third act. Even then, it's a bit hard to take seriously since they did have something to hang Scorpio on: shooting a police officer.This is a classic movie that deserves its fame. But the one flaw is that instead of writing a segue into the third act, they decided to go into an unrealistic rant that demonizes one half of the political spectrum for absolutely no real reason. It just seems a bit silly, but don't let this ruin the movie for you. Eastwood's always good, Siegel is at the top of his game, and maybe you can get a chuckle out of seeing their attempts to push the movie to the end by pathetic political doublethink.",

            "review_title": "Hard hitting, elegantly simplistic roundhouse to the crime genre",
            "content": "To tackle a storyline lynched from current news headlines of the real life Zodiac serial killer committing unspeakable murders while leaving taunting notes to the city must have taken guts aplenty, an arguably too topical event which may have attracted controversy for being passed off as mere entertainment. However, director Don Siegel must have been feeling lucky indeed, as not an ounce of fear makes its way into his boldly straightforward cinematic vision. Nor was there any need for fear, as it must have become clear that he was dealing with the stuff of legends, and his hardboiled protagonist, 'Dirty' Harry Callahan was indeed one for the ages, and his resulting film an abiding and endlessly influential classic in the cop thriller genre. Despite all preconceptions of Clint Eastwood leaving his defining genre, it is hardly as far removed as one might think, as in the end the essence of Dirty Harry remains clear: a spaghetti Western dressed up as a crime drama. From embracing countless genre themes (a lone gunman, vicious but honourable is forced to function independently to save the stifling system he could never be a part of) to having Harry brandish a .44 magnum which would hardly seem out of place in any saloon brawl to having Harry walk off by himself at the film's finish he remains every inch the classic Western protagonist, self-exiled against a claustrophobic society yet forced to protect it despite his own inability to fit in. Similarly, upon viewing in a contemporary context, it becomes clear just how influential the film was - beyond the timeless \"Do you feel lucky? Well, do ya punk?\" line, the blueprints for just about every ensuing cop thriller are lain, from the terse vigilante antihero to the perfectly paced breathless action sequences to the splendidly shot city feeling almost like a present character to the comic buddy banter between Harry and his sidekick of another race, resulting in many culture clash cracks. From the eighties on, the genre would never be the same, becoming increasingly flimsy templates, all of which owe countless thanks to Harry Callahan for paving the way. The film itself remains a masterclass in simplicity at its most refined: a lean, taut thriller trimmed of all unnecessary filler. From the very start the film gets right to the point with no mistaking its intentions and hardly lets up the swift, rock steady pace from that point on. There are no troublesome subplots (such as the exhausted genre convention of watching Harry drink himself to sleep at home) but instead the entire film focuses strictly on the case at hand, the only character development to speak of demonstrated by those reacting to the events of the Scorpio case. It must have become clear to Siegel that he had no need for showy dialogue or wordy exposition - it must have been clear he had something iconic in the making, and as such he simply lets Harry speak for himself in limited but piercing bursts of language. From the instant he first grimly saunters on screen, the audience has a fully defined perception of the man, and the later jokey deliberating on what Harry has done to merit his 'Dirty' billing is amusing but largely unnecessary - like the classic Western hero, Harry's actions speak for themselves, conveying a remarkable amount with next to no expenditure of effort. The simplicity works, whipping the film along at a cracking pace while only occasionally appearing underwritten, largely during terse moral exchanges between Harry and his superiors, which expose the moral crux of the film but overly falling prey to convention to be fully effective. Siegel's film also boasts some genuinely spectacular cinematography, showcasing the San Francisco locations with a visceral yet oddly aesthetic splendour, fully grounding the film in gritty realism while boasting a uniquely cinematic charm all the same. Siegel shows an eye for extracting the visual thrill of cinematic blackness like no other, as the film, often shot in barely visible or mostly obscured darkness demonstrates a bold intensity, a neo-noir grit to counterbalance the piercing sunlight of the daytime photography. This is a world of extremes, both moral and visual, and the cinematic composition echoes the contrast as strictly as Harry's no nonsense right counterbalances Scorpio's unhinged wrong. Lalo Schifrin's intriguing jazzy musical score completes the package, an exhilarating and entirely fitting concoction once again far ahead of its time. It goes without saying that Clint Eastwood is what really makes the movie, and indeed it is impossible to envision any other presence than the immortal Eastwood squint bringing Harry to life, despite the role passing through the hands of actors as diverse as Paul Newman, Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen, Robert Mitchum and John Wayne. Eastwood slips into the character like a leathery pair of gloves, each twinge of passionate, animalistic anger and grim detachment fully realised and not for a second unbelievable - a plausibility of character he was hard pressed to match in a formidable career. Backing Eastwood's cinematic icon, Andrew Robinson makes for a wonderfully unhinged killer, his nervy twitching and erratic demeanour making for an unorthodox and genuinely unsettling threat. Reni Santori makes for a charming comedic deadpan as Harry's unwanted partner, and John Larch and John Vernon both chew scenery accordingly as the mayor and chief of police constantly battering Harry for his risky methods and fanatical dedication to the case. While some may fault the film as being overly simplistic and certain patches do come across as borderline underwritten, Dirty Harry remains a refreshingly direct cop thriller which set a precedent for countless imitators, effectively overhauling the crime genre for decades to come. While Eastwood would reprise his iconic character for three more efforts, none would match the hard hitting, superbly crafted effectiveness of this original, easily worth seeing... for those feeling lucky enough. -9/10",

His performance both in this movie and throughout his career is good and he leaves several memorable lines like the Magnum scene.The movie is about Inspector Callahan having to take care of the city of San Francisco from its imminent dangers until a guy named \"Scorpio\" arrives, who is a Dirty villain who does anything for money and has no mercy for the others, for the same reason Callahan and his New Partner will have to foil their plans.Apparently, after the premiere of the film, it generated a debate on police brutality and Victims' Rights, but it was acclaimed by critics and considered one of the best films of 1971 and that is deserved!.This movie has great performances, especially that of Clint Eastwood, the mayor, Callahan's partner and Scorpio, who provide memorable and quality performances.The Shooting Scenes are quite Good and Tense, the Acting in them is quite good as well as the effects making the movie quite entertaining.By the way the scene where Scorpio tries to kill a Black Person is too Tense but luckily the dirty Scorpio does not achieve his goal!.As for the Music, the film does not fall short, Lalo Schifrin composed very good music for the film and it fits the feeling of any film of the genre of the 70s, the opening scene has a quite good musical theme as in the other scenes which add suspense and that is appreciated.But in spite of everything, this Movie was blamed for Inspiring several crimes such as the Kidnapping of Several School Buses (inspired by the scene where Scorpio does the same thing) but I honestly don't think the movie had much to do with that Theme.By the way, This movie has always seemed to me like Death Wish (1974) by Charles Bronson since both deal with People who end up ending a Threat but breaking the law, if you want to know my opinion of it I already have a separate Review .This movie was a revolution in its time due to the way in which they treated the Police Cinema and its Iconic scenes such as the 44 Magnum, without a doubt Callahan is one of the most memorable heroes of cinema and this man will never be forgotten by him. Action movie!.The movie is brilliant wherever you see it, the performances are impeccable as well as the cinematography, It has great scenes and sequences that make this movie perfect to see if you like this type of cinema and also cinema in general!.For everything I said above, Dirty Harry gets a 10.",

This is the stuff dreams are made of. I had seen this flick yrs ago but only now reviewing it intently I can process that it is dope as it was. Why the heck is this dope? Harry is just such a nonchalantly tough dude without even effort, almost to a hilarious way as the film opens the way Harry is so unwaveringly smooth in his assuredness, so unmitigated in his smooth strolling, his face being 1 expression, there is one little moment where his expressionless face gives it away though to reveal a face of nonstop sheer cold destruction and it's when he is asked how many rounds his weapon has by the incapacitated badguy on the ground and Harry, strolling away, turns around to return to the badguy and it's here his face looks like a freakin Eagle, eyes having this slyness/smugness to them for that instant. Without saying anything it's all told in that, that is the expression of a merciless twinkle of happiness in the dismantling of foes that he does. Whoa.I just wish we would get more and more length to the movie but then again that's why it is the beginning of a series to satiate audience's craving for more of Harold's escapades. The main badguy is revealed and is a very kinetic personality, just appears and starts annihilating people with kind of a boyish face. That *could* have some symbolism. I know from they (Eastwood has a say?) choose this actor precisely because he has a face like so which could mean that having boyish tendencies is not good and to just grow up, embrace adultness, the way Harry is. Or that's not for the audience and just for the badguy to show that he's a crazy kid inside, trailblazing villain for sure. In a way he is a mirror to Harry's own boyishness because Harry is not complicated, more 1-note. As an 'Inspector' he definitely appears to figure stuff out good in those streets like at one point he and partner 'maneuvers' through alleys and buildings like strategy to know where the badguy is to show up which is fascinating. The 1-note aspect of the movie is appealing, no need for 'layers' to things, it's kind of comic book which is... just so good. Music and cinematography are also good. I like that nothing is explained things just start happening for the plot and just I'll add everyone in there goodguy and badguy could use some milk and cookies.",

The mayor of the city plays for time which results in a fourteen-year-old girl being abducted and threatens to kill her unless a higher ransom is payed. Callahan attempts to lay a trap for the killer, but it backfires and the girl dies. The man is finally arrested but the case is dismissed due to a lack of evidence and the killer takes a private revenge against Callahan and the city of San Francisco.The first and best of Eastwood's outings as the tough and uncompromising cop with no time for the rule book or his superiors, but at the same time he hates the criminals and will go to any lengths to bring them to his own form of justice. DIRTY HARRY presents the audience with the view that the central character despite his illegal and unorthodox methods has got a higher moral sense than the people in charge and therefore caused great controversy and also ensured a box office hit. Eastwood took the role on after other actors including Frank Sinatra, Paul Newman and John Wayne among them turned the role down and he gives a first rate performance that he would repeat in four sequels. They were MAGNUM FORCE (1973), THE ENFORCER (1976), SUDDEN IMPACT (1983) and THE DEAD POOL (1988).

            "content": "On any level, large or small, the desire to see justice done in universal. Many will contend that it is more pronounced in the wake of a significant emotional experience, but in the final analysis, it's a craving with parameters of neither time nor place; a hunger that demands to be satiated. And in our tumultuous times and world, that longing for justice too often goes unsatisfied, and occasionally it's gratifying to get a taste of it, if only through the magic of the movies.  Which is exactly what you get with `Dirty Harry,' directed by Don Siegel, in which star Clint Eastwood introduces one of-- if not the-- most memorable characters of his long and varied career, the iconoclastic veteran San Francisco detective, Harry Callahan.\tIn his many years on the job, Callahan has seen it all up close and suffered personal loss, as well; so much so that he is committed to doing the right thing, even if it means discarding all the rules and proceeding as he sees fit-- playing by his own rules, as it were.  In his eyes, there's the law, and then there's justice-- and he is determined that the latter shall prevail at any cost.  Which is the lesson a psychotic killer (Andrew Robinson) is about to learn when he picks Callahan to play a game of cat-and-mouse with; a game that involves the life of a young girl he has kidnapped and is threatening to kill unless Harry jumps through some hoops of his own demented design for him.  And by the time it's over, there are lessons learned, to be sure.  Everything may not turn out happily ever after, but rest assured, before the credits roll, justice will have been served.  Dirty Harry style.\tSiegel has crafted and delivered an emotionally involving drama that makes you feel the frustration and anger of being defiled without recompense, at the hands of one of the cinema's most heinous villains ever.  Siegel presents his antagonist in such a way that very quickly he becomes a truly loathsome character who is almost unbearable to watch at times.  He is so vile, in fact, that by the time Callahan draws a bead on him you want nothing more than to see him throttled from one side of the screen to the other.  As in real life, however, things do not necessarily proceed as you would like, and you may find yourself gnashing your teeth in mounting frustration as the killer eludes Callahan's grasp time and again.  But as you're biting off yet another fingernail, keep in mind that in the end, justice is visited.\tDirty Harry Callahan is the character, it seems, that Clint Eastwood was born to play.  The attitude, the nuance and the eye for detail he brings to this role makes Callahan unique and memorable.  This is a character onto which you can project your own frustrations and sensibilities, which enables you to share not only his sense of futility, but his satisfaction as Harry ultimately metes out the justice it seems the whole world is in need of by the end of the movie.  And it's a satisfaction you will carry with you out of the theater, or beyond the confines of your own living room.  There's a depth to Eastwood's portrayal that gives you some clues as to what it is that really makes Callahan tick, but at the same time he only lets you in so far, so that by the end there is still a bit of mystery behind the man.  And even now, some thirty years after this film was made, Harry Callahan emerges as the definitive anti-hero for our times, which serves as an indication of just how strong this performance by Eastwood is.  It is, without question, one of his best.\tThere's no mystery, however, to the fact that Andrew Robinson gives an extraordinary performance here as the killer.  He is so despicable, in fact, that one has to wonder if this part perhaps had an adverse affect on his career.  On a personal note, I know that for years afterward I couldn't stand to see Robinson in anything, because no matter what part he was playing I could not get past his persona as the killer in this film.  A good example is the 1973 film `Charlie Varrick,' which is an excellent movie (also directed by Siegel), but one I would not be able to appreciate until years later because Robinson's presence was simply too overwhelming.  In retrospect, it says a lot about his ability as an actor; that he could leave such an indelible impression with a single portrayal is certainly indicative of his talent.  \tThe supporting cast includes Harry Guardino (Bressler), Reni Santoni (Chico), John Vernon (The Mayor), John Larch (Chief), John Mitchum (De Georgio), Mae Mercer (Mrs. Russell), Lun Edgington (Norma) and Ruth Kobart (Bus Driver).  Backed with a terrific score by Lalo Schifrin, `Dirty Harry' is a hard-hitting, extremely emotionally involving film (especially for one of this genre) that will get your blood pumping in any number of directions at the same time.  It's escapist fare, to be sure, but it hits so close to home that it is both disconcerting and ultimately fulfilling.  Definitely one you're going to remember.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",

            "content": "Spoilers, if one hasn't somehow yet seen the film.Before Hill Street Blues or NYPD, or Police Story, on TV, and now over 30 years old. Here was a film which opened with a dedication to fallen SFPD officers. But the fashions haven't changed that much. Hairstyles are about the same (this wasn't a completely 70s-looking film). And the cynical, edgy behavior was very 90s, and even current, today.How does the film hold up? Well, the courts don't work. The criminals are preferred over the victims. Pets are protected, people aren't. One arm of the law seems at war with the other. One statue vitiates another. The 'system' only attacks the law-abiding. Etc. And Justice demands penalty for Scorpio's crimes. So Harry is justified at Kezar, something like that. He clearly is justified at the end, because Scorpio goes for the gun. It's literally self-defense. The angry wordplay, literally the taunting, could be excused as an effort to get 'the edge'. It does seem recklessly inviting nonetheless, making Harry the killer at that moment, and the psychotic killer his victim.There are inconsistencies. Earlier, when the tooth is revealed, Harry is sure the girl is dead. When Harry is on the phone, with only Chico listening in by wireless, he asks - is the girl alive? How could it be both? So Harry is sure she's dead. But then as 'bagman', he runs all over town to catch the psycho. He shoots him and tortures him in the stadium, because he wants to know if he can rescue her - before she dies? The stadium scene is really the key scene of the film. It's startling when DeGeorgio hits the stadium lights at just the right time. It ends in the helicopter shot, as that used in Easy Rider, for example (the final scene pull back, and stop, which terminates this and other Harry films). And it's a good explanation of San Francisco; 'rolled up' city streets, cold low fog, wet stadium (Kezar stadium was since rebuilt, lowered, and named after HOF 'niner Bob Sinclair).As others have pointed out, Eastwood had to apologize for Dirty Harry, at least in the subsequent two films. That's what really crippled those two sequels. They were Dirty Harry lite, even anti-Harry, that were afraid of Dirty Harry. The fourth film returned a bit to the original. And he does let himself, or rather his mirror image in Sondra Locke's character, off the hook as an angel of justice in her own right.This film is a hit because of the odd combination of the minimalist score, Siegel, Eastwood of course, but also Robinson who makes the film for his insanely perverted killer, who like Malkovich's killer in a later Eastwood film, and unlike aux. Rat-Packer Silva in a 'Eastwood-type' film from Burt Reynolds, doesn't even need to 'shoot up' to kill. He just shoots and doesn't blink, completely sober. And he seems driven to commit murder and mayhem at any opportunity. In that, he approaches the nightmarish demons of later slasher films in the 70s. And it rings true for his whimpering when it suits him, just like any real bully or hardened thug.As for Harry, again, hero or killer? He is the very model of competence without any wasted motion. Or is he just an egotist, a Bill Clinton before anyone really knew? How did you know he was a rapist - asks the mayor? Over his shoulder Harry explains - trust ME to do the job. Don't ask questions. You do your job. I'll do mine. Oh wait, that was Steve McQueen in Bullitt, dressing down Robert Vaughn's untrustworthy martinet. So yes, his role is similar to that of John Wayne, in that 'Wayne's characters would often make their own law, out of frustration or convenience, or to achieve advantage. But even as a loner, The Duke had a 'posse'. There were people in town who called him friend. Dirty Harry is the man-with-no-name, a past but no family, etc. You don't know about the guy. There is no 'posse'. There are no drinking buddies.And what else about Harry? He confronts Popwell, shotgun on the ground nearby, with the famous bluff. Harry's gun is empty. Of course, Popwell's character is injured, so Harry could just have stepped on his arm if he'd gone for it. But he taunts. He knows his bullet count, and he taunts. Harry enjoys the 'reluctant hero', a bit too much. The 'dirty job' - is fun. Dirty Harry breaks the law to satisfy justice; or at least that's his plan. But as Urich asks in one of the 'extras' - can we have cops like this? And his obvious answer is, not really. What you don't see in this film, or subsequent films, is the dangerous side of Harry; when the bet goes bad. You only have hints. On the exit to 'Q' (and, of course, Scorpio doesn't live long enough to even get to prison), he hops the bus, potentially putting the kids and driver in further danger. In fact, the killer slugs the terrified driver because of the new danger.One last thing. The camera angles and perspectives are very interesting, and should be studied by anyone making a movie. The minimalist, almost drum n bass with choir, soundtrack is the extension of the Leone soundtracks, really, and a no-frills counterpoint to Shaft, perhaps, which had been released earlier that year. The characters, the actors themselves, look real. This is hand-held cameras and realism ala NYPD in the first year, and so on. That's how you make a 'B-film'. The chopper cops, and other detectives, people in the street - these look like real people on the job, not actors playing real people on the job. Much was made of this sort of thing in Bullitt, for example. The sets are faithful, and sometimes the progression of scenes are faithful to the geography.",

            "content": "The narrative.As a crime genre, Dirty Harry fulfils many crime conventions such as gun scenes, chases, cop jokes, mystery and suspense. The direction by Siegel (Two mules for Sister Sara) is great, especially at the beginning when the first incident happens. The film adds plenty of mystery and suspense for the audience to keep in track with one of the most famous crime films in history. The story builds up the tension at necessary points with many gun scenes encoded for emphasis. Its clear to see nowadays that gun scenes are overdone where as here in this classic there are few, adding a more realistic view of crime life. The film captures the realistic conventions of everyday police work and fulfils its purpose. It may lack at points but it's certainly entertaining throughout. The ending is very well directed and is very gripping.Characters and acting.Harry is certainly an astonishing character. His charisma towards his job is amazing and the way he treats others is jaw dropping, a terrific performance by Oscar winning Eastwood (Million Dollar baby). His infamous catchphrases make his character what he is \"Do you feel lucky?\" Many police are used to show a wide cop force, emphasising the power of Harry's reputation. The villain, played brilliantly by Robinson (Charley Varrick) is exactly what was required, a dominant force, a complete lunatic running riot to do what is needed to get what he wants for himself and he alone adds the suspense to the narrative.Ideologies.There are issues regarding jobs and murder used to build up the tension. Harry is particularly negative towards his job at many points and this technique is perhaps used to advice audiences to respect what they have. The murder and paedophilia issues are also very powerful and capture audience interest.watch it if...crime and amazing catchphrases are your thing",

            "content": "Dirty Harry is one of Clint Eastwood's quintessential roles after his western trilogy playing \"The Man with No Name.\" In it he plays Harry Callahan, a cop who play by his own rules and doesn't give a damn about what anybody else thinks of his methods. Essentially, he is the epitome of the unconventional cop. Yet, despite his somewhat disparaging attitude, he is a very likable character. He is the tough guy, beaming with attitude and style, who you would always want on your side in a fight. It's not to say he doesn't take his job seriously though. He does. In the movie, Harry is chasing a serial killer who calls himself Scorpio (Andrew Robinson). But due to his unconventional behavior, Dirty Harry soon finds himself at war with not only Scorpio, but also the legal system. This, of course, causes Dirty Harry to take matters into his own hands. And so ensues an exciting and violent game of cops and robbers.Dirty Harry is a movie with style and attitude. It is what it is, and it makes sure you know it. It's the story of a hard-boiled cop fighting the most dangerous of criminals, and it shows in all aspects of the movie. It is a fun and riveting film with a climax that will have you on the edge of your seat. Don Seigel's directing captures every harrowing moment in the chases between Dirty Harry and Scorpio and Harry and Rita Fink's script delivers some fantastic one-liners that won't be forgotten.What the film lacks in a deep and intricate plot it makes up for in its style. Clint Eastwood makes a very believable tough guy as always and Andrew Robinson plays the crazed and psychopathic serial killer almost too well. Dirty Harry is an overall fun experience that doesn't leave you billowing over with emotion, but it leaves you satisfied nonetheless.",

            "content": "Dirty Harry. The title itself suggests a high level of veracity and a bad-ass performance from the title character. By God does this movie deliver in more ways than one. Before Lethal Weapon, Clint Eastwood was the ultimate cop. San Francisco Police Inspector Harry Callahan is our cop fully realized. A man who cares about protecting the victims and getting the job done, before bureaucrats and the law try to stop him. Eastwood and director/mentor Don Siegel give us one of the best movies ever made, especially considering what genre it's in. It also ranks high for me because I am a native San Franciscan, so seeing my city for a story such as this is breathtaking.The story entails Harry's cat-and-mouse game between him and the psychotic killer known only as \"Scorpio.\" Scorpio is based on the infamous Bay Area Zodiac Killer, who killed and kidnapped people for ransom from City Hall, but unlike the movie, he was never seen or identified. The actor who plays Scorpio, Andy Robinson, plays what is one of, if not my number one, greatest villains of all time. He looks like a choir-boy (as Siegel had intended) and he plays him with absolute menace and sadism. He is truly terrifying and looks like he just has fun playing the SFPD (especially Harry) like fools when he throws a loop in the procedures. He is flawless all the way to the end, and I believe Robinson was unfairly snubbed for a Best Supporting Actor nomination.We also begin to see one of the biggest ideas in the movie. During this game, Harry gains an even greater enemy, the suits from City Hall and even the higher-ups in the Police Hall of Justice. Because of Harry's methods of bringing Scorpio to justice. The issue of victims rights vs. the rights of the criminals and often how criminals are unfairly released because of the red tape and laws that would allow it are presented extremely well in this movie and also annoys us when we realize there are such laws on the books.With that in mind, when Harry takes it upon himself to apply the law as he sees it, it leads to some of the greatest scenes in Hollywood history. He is able to stop a bank and deliver his signature line \"Do you feel lucky punk?\" all while chewing on a hot dog on his lunch break. The other is on the field of the hallowed Kezar Stadium as Harry shoot Scorpio down and tortures the information of the girls whereabouts out of him. When I said that Harry is our idea of a cop fully realized, these scenes are what solidifies that statement. He does what we want to do to sickos like Scorpio, and shows us how people like this should be treated, instead of worrying if we will get in trouble. Is the torture scene violent? Yes it is. But that violence is what gets people talking about this movie, much like what Quentin Tarantino seeks for his movies, a debate about the ideas presented in the movies.This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting is perfect, the writing is phenomenal, Don Siegel is at his finest here. San Francisco looks spectacular and gives the perfect backdrop for such a story. If you are feeling lucky, check out the movie and judge for yourselves.",

            "content": "This is kind of a hard one to decide about. First of all, Clint Eastwood is totally overrated as an actor. The part where he says, \"Ask yourself: do I feel lucky,\" kind of reminds me of Terminator 2, where they kind of go fishing for memorable lines and the anticipation falls short. It felt totally cheap and forced. The second time he recites the famous screed, at the very end, to the killer, felt overdone and overused. This movie kind of feels like a composite of known serial killers in real life, and they could have been a bit more creative. You have the Scorpio killer in the movie, which is a take on The Zodiak in real-life; you've got Harry as a Peeping Tom, which was what Ted Bundy was known for; and you have a killer who targets gays, like Jeffrey Dahmer did. After watching this movie, I got the impression that Eastwood himself is a bit of a perv, as a recurring motif is \"Peeping Tom.\" Such as his one line, where, while on a stake-out, he says to himself, \"You owe it to yourself to live a little, Harry,\" while spying on a swingers' party when he should have been looking for Scorpio!! I thought he was a supposedly good detective!! Needless to say, there's a lot of nudity interspersed into the story. There's very little character development, as Harry is a person you either love or hate, and you mind is not changed throughout the very singular and narrow narrative. In fact, this feels more like a documentary in the style of 'Cops' than it feels as an actual movie. The music is very good, however. I give credit to Lalo Schifrin, who does a fantastic job. The plot elements are intriguing enough to give this a watch, I suppose. Andy Robinson's performance as a likewise- one dimensional Scorpio killer is at least passable. What this really was, was a personal statement about life in the 1970's and not much more.",

Scorpio kills for fun and is a disgusting human being. Harry knows how dangerous he is but his preferred methods of bringing him down get him in trouble with his superiors. Harry eventually gets fed up with his bosses and sets out to arrest Scorpio using his own methods. One of the things that makes this film great are the characters. Harry doesn't really follow the common rules but never fails to get results. Scorpio was based off of the Zodiac killer which is easy to see because he goes all over the place. By that I mean he doesn't really have any one signature weapon, or one type of victim. Most serial killers have one type of person they go after but Scorpio is completely random. The dialog from Harry is pretty funny because he's sarcastic, and a wise guy to his superiors and to pretty much everyone. Overall this is a really good action movie, so I highly recommend it.",

It's a pretty frightening feeling knowing someone could be watching you and targeting you for a killing for no reason other than they just feel especially mean.Some scenes in this movie are hard to watch. In fact, I won't watch the scene where Scorpio terrorizes a bunch of children on a school bus. (Incidentally, I have lived around natives of Scorpio all my life. Most of them are wonderful people.) I really feel sorry for the actor that played him. This part must have ruined his career. I think someone on this site said he got death threats after playing this role. It's a pity so many people out there can't distinguish make believe from reality. Andy Robinson did a fine job. Scorpio is the most despicable movie villain I have ever seen.This is by no means adverse criticism of this movie. I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood and of the Dirty Harry series, except for maybe THE DEAD POOL, and I've already commented on that. They really draw you into this movie and tells a riveting story.I think people who say Harry Callahan meted out vigilante justice are totally misreading his character. I have seen this movie many times over the years, and Harry always followed police procedure before shooting anyone. The only times he shot at anyone was (1) if they tried to shoot him first and (2) when a fleeing suspect wouldn't stop after he ordered them to. In most police precincts across the country, an officer can shoot a fleeing suspect if he doesn't stop after being ordered to do so.The scene that really gets my Irish up is when Harry asks the DA who speaks for the murdered Deacon girl. The DA says, \"We will, if you will let us.\" Yeah, right. While we're at it, let's hire Charlie Brown to coach the Washington Redskins. Every thinking person knows that the government has an uncanny knack for screwing up a wet dream.In spite of its disturbing aspects a great movie. 9.5 out of 10.",

The football pitch scene is astounding, but for me, the single factor that lifts this movie into legendary status is the astounding performance of Andy Robinson as Scorpio. Cowardly, terrifying, human and yet emotionless, he is devoted to the part for every second and is a true portrait of the serial killer. A resounding scream of defiance to all the liberal attitudes of the sixties, Dirty Harry is a product of modern society, but unlike Death Wish the film doesn't want to stand up and celebrate him, only show how he is a necessary evil.",

Siegel and Eastwood push the thriller genre a bit further in this movie with a fresh new type of character in cinema - the radical tough cop who fights the inconsistencies of the Law to achieve justice - and a frightening new attitude to the villain: Scorpio is just about one of the creepiest, most sadistic and brutal villains in cinema: he goes from killing innocent children to inflicting pain on himself to have his sick way; Scorpio is hardly a cartoonish villain as you'd find in a ridiculous movie like 'The Punisher.' 'Dirty Harry' is also a well-paced story with lots of thrills, twists and gripping moments: Scorpio sending Harry Callahan run all over town to see if he's bugged, his brutally spanking him, the chilling sequence at the stadium where Harry shows just how much he wants justice, and the final action sequence at the school bus, make sure this movie is never boring! Sure, Harry, Scorpio and all the other supporting characters aren't particularly developed, nor will anyone find anything new about the human condition in this thriller. If anything, the movie is a treatise on attitude and how to live in an insane society with strange laws that let criminals go free; it emanates a lot of pessimism for society and lack of trust in authority figures, and shows how those who just want to serve good may in the end have to break the law for it. No doubt, this is really a product of the spirit of the '70's, and yet the frustrations Harry feels remain completely fresh today for anyone to relate to.",

First off, let's be clear what Dirty Harry is: despite Callahan's title, this is not a detective movie.  Rather this is a pure, unadulterated cop flick, and plotwise a rather generic one.  There is very little actual detective work and there is no whodunnit subplot.  There is a bit of one-on-one, cat-and-mouse intercourse between the cop and the crook, but unlike say Insomnia, Seven, or Eastwood's own In the Line of Fire, Scorpio is by no means a sophisticated mastermind.Rather, he is a generic, carefree blend of society's worst stereotypes: thief, rapist, killer, kidnapper, pedophile, conman, racist...you name it. Because Scorpio is such an obviously awful person and because he's able to so easily exploit the system, the movie comes off as a bit one-sided politically.  At times the movie seem superficial to the modern viewer; some of the trimmed fat might even be construed as outright plot holes.  For example, it seems silly that the DA and the judge need to lecture Harry as if he'd never heard of the Bill of Rights.  How would someone rise to Inspector without at least a basic understanding of the legal system?Nevertheless, Dirty Harry is high on style and a must-see for any fan of the genre.  It's a back-to-basics movie on how to characterize and develop a cop lead.  And of course, it has Harry's immortal speech.  The action is okay too for its time, and its impressive that Eastwood did all his own stunts. All in all I give it an imdb 7.",

Whether it's midday shootings or midnight terrors, it's a city's worst nightmare and one that will not cease.Clint Eastwood flourishes in his role as Harry, who's as dirty and stone cold as they come. The world is the limit for him, but he is conflicted with his duties and moral obligations. With a killing spree capturing the innocent lives of Californians, Harry goes to incredible extents to track and take down an elusive criminal. It's an uphill battle, though, as it appears both the criminals and department have no respect for the spirit of the law. Dirty Harry shies away from being a clich\u00e9 crime movie as it displays a multidimensional killer; one that is knowledgeable and cunning--necessary qualities to deceive the whole public. It's thrilling throughout and the upbeat tempo ensures there's never a dull moment. I was quite surprised with this movie. I've always been a fan of Eastwood's films and this is no different. With great acting across the board and an even better storyline to match, Dirty Harry will surely entertain.",

YES a lot of movies have a political thrust which oftentimes can be very offensive to some viewers, while egging others on. YES not all movies have impeccable, smart scripts performed by believable actors. YES movies, like anything else, are completely subjective to the cultural/social environment from which they emerge. But do these truisms excuse \"Dirty Harry\" for being a crap movie? BUSHIT! Wow, I almost feel like this movie was a response to blaxploitation--white-s p l o i t a t i o n, maybe? But I looked at the date, and it was 1971--so, if Sweet Sweetback's Baaaaaaaaaaaddddddddassssssssss Song had come out, it was very recently, and it only played in 2 theaters in the nation at first anyway. . . so I guess it's safe to assume this movie wasn't a response to blaxploitation (a genre in which cops are generally looked down upon. But Le's' just examine that for a minuet, shall we? Who was looked down upon in \"Dirty Harry\"? Ineffectual cops, the overly liberal SF justice system, the pussy mayor--so surprisingly emf, I guess there are some bizarre similarities between Harry and Coffy. Each is a \"wildly\" independent character reacting against an ineffectual legal system. Maybe today it just smarts to see the law portrayed as not-tough-enough when people get arrested for being black/poor/breathing wrong all the goddamn time. OK, never-mind, I'm fer-getting my own point, which is that movies are products of their cultures. Stamp out some flowers, blah blah blah, kill some pot.) Whatever. That aside, I MUST say the guy who played the baddie was really completely 100% worth watching and FUNNY cos basically if acting sucks there's still salvageable bits (tho whoever it was that said the part he acted in the liquor store was good--yam you're completely right), ESPECIALLY his reaction to getting stabbed in the leg. He reminds me a lot of the bad kid in that movie The Warriors. Huh. So yam, if this movie came out now I'd be screaming disinformation and tearing the upholstery off the sofa w/ my teeth, but really it's just pointed out to me that Clint Eastwood, though wonderful w/ Leone, can't really act in this movie, I need to get off my political high horse, and kids don't cry when they get holed up on a bus w/ Mr. Scary Man. What a world. I give the movie 10 stars because I'd rather have to walk barefoot on 10 stars in outer space than watch Droopy Hairy again. Jeah.",

And yes, I was there. It's rather relevant today too, with all the rioting taking place but - we will, unfortunately, never see another Dirty Harry. Too truthful and therefore too 'triggering'. Our current establishment has gotten much too mamby-pamby for that.\nDeath Wish was another well-timed flick, for the same reason. Violence running over in the city and politicians and bureaucrats too afraid to do anything about it. Yep, that's 'Dirty Harry'. So, Harry does what needs to be done. He is what 'most' members of the audience, in 1971, wanted to see. Well placed and deserved ACTION. A comeuppance. The movie even plays upon the pathetic-ness of our courts by allowing Scorpio to 'walk' due to some ridiculous LEGAL technicality - AFTER he tells them where to find the dead girl. Our justice system. No different today. No justice for the law-abiding. But again people, in 1971, were fed up.\nIt's a satisfying film too in that the psycho gets it in the end. Way too many more modern films twist their ending. Since movies, to me, are supposed to be escapism, having a satisfying ending is important and having just invested two hours of my life into a film, I demand it. So, if the powers-that-be decide to 'subvert my expectations? Well, ... I will probably NEVER watch it again and will no doubt, share my displeasure with others. That is of course, THEIR choice. Mine, too. They need be prepared, though, for a rather dismal after-market for streaming and DVD sales cause I, at least, won't be buying it.\nGive it a watch, while you can, if you like well-placed action and mild violence.

            "content": "Dirty Harry makes cinematic history by introducing audiences to SFPD Homicide Inspector Harry Callahan played by Clint Eastwood. Inspector Harry Callahan is someone who is not afraid to bend the rules and overstep the line to bring criminals to justice, in some cases stopping them cold in their tracks with his Smith & Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum revolver handgun. Along the way Inspector Callahan defies incompetent superiors to get the job done. Since Dirty Harry blasted its way onto cinemas in 1971, Harry Callahan has since became a template for a new breed of cop audiences have come to love. An antihero who is not afraid to cross professional and ethical boundaries in their fearless pursuit of their own vision of justice, especially when the law is poorly served by an inept bureaucracy and hampered by red tape. The main character finds themselves frequently reprimanded, suspended or even dismissed by superiors for their renegade actions. Dirty Harry was criticized by some critics who considered the movie to be fascist and sparked many debates about police brutality, however the film resonated with an American public that had become frustrated with increasing violent crime rates that was characteristic of the time. Dirty Harry was also a critical and commercial success, and to this day is considered to be a classic movie as well as one of Clint Eastwood's best movies.Clint Eastwood introduces us to Inspector Harry Callahan, an unorthodox homicide detective who is fearless in his pursuit of bringing criminals to justice but is willing to bend the rules and police procedure when necessary. He often butts heads with his superiors and his partners often end up wounded or killed in the line of duty. We get to see Inspector Callahan in action when he foils a bank robbery in downtown San Francisco while he is having lunch, killing two bank robbers and wounding a third. When the wounded robber reaches for his shotgun, Callahan challenges him by introducing us to the immortal line, \"I know what you're thinking: 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?\" The robber wisely surrenders but tries his luck again by asking Callahan is he had one round left or if the gun was empty.Inspector Callahan has been assigned a new partner, the fresh faced Chico Gonzales (Reni Santoni) against Callahan's wishes to which Lieutenant Bressler (Harry Guardino) tells him that the order is final. Inspectors Callahan and Gonzales are tasked to take down a madman sniper calling himself Scorpio (Andrew Robinson) who has been terrorising San Francisco by killing innocent citizens with a sniper rifle and making ransom demands. The cat and mouse game takes a dangerous turn when Scorpio kidnaps a teenage girl and buries her alive along with a larger ransom demand. Inspector Callahan must stop Scorpio's reign of terror, even if it means throwing police procedure and rules out the window.Clint Eastwood previously made his mark in Westerns such as the TV show Rawhide and the classic The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1968). In 1971, he reaches a turning point in his career with Dirty Harry, as well as being cast in further roles as a police officer. Clint Eastwood gives his take on Harry Callahan as an urban cowboy fearless and relentless in his pursuit of justice. Considering that the role of Harry Callahan perfectly fits like a glove for Clint Eastwood, it's hard to believe that many actors were considered for the role including John Wayne, Frank Sinatra, Robert Mitchum, Burt Lancaster, Steve McQueen and Paul Newman.Dirty Harry works perfectly as a hard boiled crime movie. There's no car chases, explosions, minimal action sequences, and thankfully no romantic scenes. The movie is tightly wound with no nonsense direction from Don Siegel.Dirty Harry spawned a further four sequels as well as leading the way in popular culture. Without Dirty Harry, there would be no Axel Foley from Beverly Hills Cop, no Marion Coberetti from Cobra, no Martin Riggs from Lethal Weapon, no John McClane from Die Hard, and actors such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Wesley Snipes, Steven Seagal, and Jean Claude Van Damme feature similar characters that were strongly influenced by Clint Eastwood's Harry Callahan. There have even been TV Shows that have been inspired by Dirty Harry. 80's cop show Hunter with Fred Dryer as LAPD Detective Rick Hunter was inspired by Dirty Harry. 80's cop comedy Sledge Hammer! with David Rasche in the titular role is a parody of Dirty Harry. And in recent times, Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer from 24 introduced modern day TV audiences to a more ruthless version of Harry Callahan, who is not hindered by rules and the law in his pursuit of terrorists, sometimes even torturing and murdering suspects.Dirty Harry lives on as an iconic movie, and Clint Eastwood's loose-cannon and trigger happy Inspector Harry Callahan remains as an iconic character in cinema history.9/10.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood is one of the very few actors who can be regarded as the one who is the epitome of numerous genre's. He first made his mark in Spaghetti western's playing characters who were enigmatic loners with a haunting past which is barely revealed, but was his motivating factor for dealing harshly with outlaws who preyed on the defenseless. The 'Man with no name' had little to say - he did it all with handguns used with deadly precision and his icy coolness unsettled his opponents. Eastwood has definitely surpassed John Wayne as the cowboy people most remember when westerns are mentioned. Then fortuitously he landed the role of 'Dirty Harry' after Frank Sinatra was forced to drop out. Although the man who 'did it my way' was a shrewd choice for the lead role, one doubts whether he could have claimed the character as his own the way Eastwood did. Now Eastwood defined another genre - the action genre.Harry Callahan is a man who believes in his heavy handed brand of justice. A tragic past drives him - his wive's death at the hand of a drunk driver - and once again Eastwood is the lone gunman defending the weak. He cuts out his individuality in the police force with his long hair and big gun. The gun is his means to rid the streets of those who harm others. He has no regard for 'outlaws' who operate outside of society's morals and will taunt them with sarcastic remarks. His taunts took on a more serious tone at the climax when he challenged Scorpio to go for his gun. We are in no doubt that he hates this man and that he wants to clear the streets of him permanately. Harry's flaws are also outside of what is acceptable and proper. His drive to deal with the bad guys endangers others and he has little time for inexperienced partners who may get in the way of his own brand of justice. But the audience forgives him for these flaws as he vigilante style rids society of it's menace. His one - liners are not frivolous and create tension as he challenges the bad guys. Harry thus exudes immense power since his is doing what others wish they could do. He becomes the hero of those who may be disheartened with the system and deals out just rewards. Harry is frustrated by 'gutless' superiors who he regards are the ones who are putting society at risk. They regard him as a loose cannon, but serves a use when it comes to dangerous jobs. In the end he gives up on the system and walks away from it. Thus Harry is the 'man with no name' in the 70's. We can see that Eastwood found the transition very natural.Scorpio is ultimate example of scum to Harry. He will harm anyone who gets in his way and kills to gain a sense of power. Money is not the compelling factor in his deadly game, but the power to challenge authority and take lives. He even pays for a severe beating so that he could frame Harry. Undoubtably he wants to make society pay for his misfortunes. The fact that no motivating factors are revealed makes him seem more cold - blooded and psychotic. His maniacal laughs and twisted expressions create a man who is separate from us and only exists for one thing - to kill. Andy Robinson's contribution to making this movie the benchmark that it became, must almost sit beside that of Eastwood's. He creates a character that seems so inheritly evil, Dirty Harry became Clean Harry after killing him. Performances like this were lacking in the sequel, although that is not the only reason they pale by comparison.Although Harry will be incomparable to the police of that time, the movie starts off with a tribute to them. They get away with it since Eastwood makes Harry the cop the audience wants to see. Of note here is the fact that some police departments produced training videos showing scenes from 'Dirty Harry' and using them as an example of 'how not to it'. This, as proven by the numerous sequels, was never to prove a deterrant for audience's as Harry blasted his '44 across our screens. He was also to influence action heroes of the future, most notably Arnold Schwarznegger.To have not watched this movie, is to have missed a genre defining one. Not only did Eastwood claim title to another unforgettable character, action thrillers were influenced by him. His one - liners are a huge part of our action heroes of today. The anti - hero (Harry), although not started by this movie, become the benchmark against which audiences were to measure others. It may seem dated, but complex characters and great acting will always provide entertainment through the generations.",

Well done for it, and it was partly inspired by factual cases where killers had their charges dropped after lawyers argued the accuseds' abuse and violation of legal rights by police. Eastwood plays a homicide inspector who is so sick of the legal system being played by defence lawyers he has decided to be judge himself, meaning trouble for any murderer he's chasing.What's surprised me reading about the making of it is how many big name star actors were approached for the role of Dirty Harry and turned it down in apparent disgust at the character and the tone of the film. Newman I could understand but not some of the others - Lee Marvin! Step up Clint Eastwood and walk into movie super stardom! And there isn't anyone who'd've done a better job of it. Wayne maybe in his day but his day had gone to do it credibly.Eastwood played the zero tolerance cop with relish and conviction and no shortage of style. From the half eaten hot dog to the pistol pointing wise cracking ending, the first shoot out scene, so blunt and direct and full of charisma delivered a picture into movie folk lore. Relentless from then on with really hard hitting scenes for 71, this would cause a stir in the movie industry after audiences loved it and wanted more. They got a lot more and not just from Dirty Harry, as there were many imitators after this iconic (sorry couldn't avoid it) movie.Eastwood was supremely charismatic and super cool in his portrayal, giving us one of the most memorable and quotable movie characters ever. But a special mention must go to Andy Robinson as the really disturbing killer who has nearly as much screen time as Eastwood and goes to town on his nutcase compulsive murderer, Scorpio. You'd probably question the Mayor not insisting Harry Callahan be taken off the case, considering he wanted to pay off Scorpio from the start but it's clear even Harry's superiors have more than an sneaky admiration for his no nonsense methods.Dirty Harry, the movie is a hard slapping crime thriller that still serves as an antidote to legal weakness and injustice and political correctness. I've watched it countless times and it just seems to get stronger with every passing decade. The film packs a punch on many levels, not least pure entertainment and should be on any serious top 250 list.

            "content": "To watch this film now is to take a peek back at a time when we weren't so conservative, or P.C, or concerned with things like 'racial stereotypes'. It's a breath of fresh air. Hugely influential, this film hasn't aged one bit. The music is distinctly 70's, yes, but it's very good. Easily the best film in the Dirty Harry series - the follow up suffered from very weak, 2 dimensional bad-guys and the progressively more boring sub-plot of Callaghan's continual clashing with his superiors. Detective Inspector Callaghan is a flawed man - a xenophobe, a voyeur and prone to going with his gut rather than obeying the rules. However, he was the first in a long line of flawed cop characters to be brought to life on the cinema screen so his character should be looked upon as a seminal touchstone in popular film culture. Mel Gibson's 'Martin Riggs' from the first Lethal Weapon film is a similar character, and probably the best successor to Callaghan, and it's interesting to note that the rooftop jumper scene in the first 'Lethal Weapon' owes much to the similar scene in 'Dirty Harry'. Of course, one of the reasons that this film is so great is because of the infectious malevolence of the villain 'Scorpio', played to the hilt, and then some, by Andy Robinson. All of the villains that followed in the Dirty Harry series paled by comparison and that's probably one of the big reasons why this is the best film in the series. A great film that stands the test of time.",

            "content": "Dirty Harry is one of the most iconic role of Clint Easthood and in film in general and a far as police movies go is one of the oldest and the best even though it is at the time of that review forty five years old! Here I won't spoil the movie, for you have to see it, because it rocks hard and the action is even harder rather I will write down the significance of Dirty Harry for the film industry and then a focus to the genres in which the impact was more apparent. And here we go!Firstly the movie is a bit like a western, logical for Clint before he became a hardcore cop he was one of the most bad ass cowboys in movie history. So from letting that type of character die out along with the westerns they adapt it into the modern (seventies) age. Keep in mind that this is the early seventies and back then the anti-war movement against the Vietnam War was at its peak, the crime rate was increasing at an alarming speed and the audience need for blood in general was at an all time low. In short a movie, which made a violent policeman a hero, should had been shoot from the sky. But why that didn't happened?Firstly Harry Kallachan (yes I know his surname) and his unorthodox and cynical attitude mirrored the view of many people back then for the government which seemed unable to do protect them from crime and domestic abuse, despite the strong outraged by Peace promoting and Feminist organizations at the time, for its raw character and as they said fascist behavior against the law and the rights of a person. Also in my point of view that backlash may help the film to make almost nine times its budget of 4 million dollars, for least be real when you here when you her so much hate for some piece of art ,then you are going to see it in order to determine yourself how good or bad it is. The same happen with Batman v Superman, X-men Apocalypse and all the Transfomer movies!Now to the two focus parts: 1. The crime fighting in movies. Before Dirty Harry the crime movies were,for the most part, tales of good versus evil with a little gun- fight in order to remind the audience that they aren't watching a kids film. After it and its brothers of the French Connection (the original of 1971) ,a Clockwork Orange and of course The Godfather opened the crime depiction to more Grey areas were the protagonist lacks some characteristics of the hero types, in short he becomes an antihero and the villain has values that makes you like him! 2.Vigilante justice. Now that is also the most important influence in my view because a man taking justice to its own hands what completely out of question up to that point, with the hippy movement and what we said before. But after its success many more people went to give their take to the way of vigilante. What we got was films like The Taxi Driver, Death Wish and if you go farther in time you get the Batman films series,2012 Dredd The Crow,the films of Kill Bill, V for Vendeta and the awesome television crime series of Daredevil ,Arrow and Jessica Jones. To put it simple no Dirty Harry, no vigilante movies and no superhero films and series for what are these people but judge, juries and executioners?This my take to the legacy of officer Callahan actions and impact to popular culture ,I hope that this analyses will make you watch it and then spread the word.",

            "content": "9.2A lot of people don't like police officers. They see them as men and women who are abusing power. It is easy, in their eyes, to become a police officer and gain authority. While I agree that there are certainly a great number of police officers (and military men) who fall under this stereotype, there is still the fact that when things get shaky, the first person you want to see is a police officer.The character Dirty Harry, the protagonist in the film, is a very clich\u00e9 character. In your fantasy, if you were a cop, would you be something like Dirty Harry? You most likely would. He's a man of action, he get's the job done, no matter how dirty it is. He keeps his top on, until it's time for it to come off. Dirty Harry doesn't say much, but he's got a lot to say. The tensity of the two scenes where he spouts his very famous line produces the highlights of the film. Dirty Harry is wild, but he has style. And boy, does it come off with style. That's one thing that the film has going for it, style. From the surprising use of natural colors, such as the blue sky against yellow text and the greys of San Francisco, to the soundtrack, with the hip music that plays once the villain is about to make an appearance. San Francisco feels alive, and the film made me want to go visit the city.As interesting as Dirty Harry is as a character, as well as the crazed villain, the film trades realism and humility for Hollywoodized fantasy. Dirty Harry is the cop that people who aren't cops want to be. He's not afraid to break the law to capture the criminals. The villain, Scorpio, is the criminal that people who aren't criminals would like to be. He exhibits insanity (but doesn't lack intelligence and craft), appears to do wicked things with absolutely no motive, and manages to keep the hero on his toes.But movies aren't supposed to be realistic. They are well off being the fantastical exaggerations of society that they are. In that sense, Dirty Harry is perfect. It's got good performances, incredible amounts of style, and very powerful scenes. From the first scene to the very last, the film will surprise you with its lack of mediocrity. There's just one thing that I still want to know. Was it ketchup, or was it blood? Dirty Harry is the quintessential crime film. Don't cop out, watch this classic.",

            "content": "Dirty Harry is the prototype for a lot of the Cop flicks that surfaced after this one made it's debut. Dirty Harry was condemned for the violence and the attitude of Harry towards the criminals. The movie was not intended to glorify violence but rather to present it in a horrifying light. The story is simple: A crazed sniper named Scorpio is on the loose he just killed a young girl in a pool atop of a hotel. He sends a Note to the city demanding one million dollars or he will kill a priest or a black person. When the city does not comply he kills a black youth. And kidnaps a young girl. The Cop in charge of this Case is inspecter Harry Callahan partnered with a rookie cop named Gonzales despite his protests (Things happen to my partners he informs him) Harry agree to make the ransom drop and what follows is one of the most psychological and physical moments on the screen as Scorpio literally has Harry run all over San Francisco until He is satisfied that Harry is tired and cannot fight back. When they meet Scorpi taunts Harry intending to kill him and then he tells him He changes his mind the girl Dies. Harry and Scorpio fight and Gonzales Saves Harry .Harry then proceeds to beat and torture Scorpio for information to where the girl is. He invalidates his case and finds the girl's body. What follows is Harry pursuing the killer determined to stop him even as the city warns him to back off. Even when Scorpio tries to frame Harry for beating him a move which fails and sets up the climax in which both men finally face each other and Harry finally dispenses justice. The movie is not about Harry's methods but rather the failings of the system in which the killer's rights are more important then the victims. Dirty Harry comes across as a noble knight in a savage land on some crusade why he's on this crusade is never explained nor is it pointed at said he's on one but you can tell by his actions. This movie is perhaps one of the greatest high points of the 70's and it actually is a classic that deserves it's place in history. It's dated in some places but ahead of it's time in others.",

Well, all of that may be true, but it still remains a hell of a good movie. Harry Callahan the San Fransico cop who hates people who break the law. And ..real baddies ?? he cant stand them. When a mad bad person (played by Andy Robinson) starts killing people and asking for a ransom, (after he kidnaps a young girl) Harry becomes mad. I mean real mad dog mad.

However, the morality and philosophy underpinning it is a hopeless muddle.

If anyone should have received an award, or at least a nomination, for best supporting actor it was Andy Robinson for his Scorpio.

            "content": "The 1970's were the decade for American cop movies, not to mention the TV police detective shows that seemed to be being churned out with such regularity throughout the decade.It clearly was a genre defining period in big screen and small screen entertainment. So much so that by the end of the 1970's vertically every veteran actor or upcoming newbie had all rolled their dice in the game at least once, some with more success than others.The film that really started the ball rolling though was 'Dirty Harry' made right at the beginning of the decade in 1971.Cop/detective films were nothing new of course, they had been making them way back in the 30's and the film noir vogue of the late 1940's gave us the model for the hard boiled 'Private eye' or dishevelled police Lieutenant.However, although back in the day these films were considered 'gritty' they were still heavily sanitised by the Hays office. It wasn't until movie censorship was well and truly consigned to history that true realism could be brought in and the lines between good and evil could be blurred into total ambiguity.We are fortunate therefore that by the late 1960's actors like Clint Eastwood and Director Don Siegel were free to not only bring such stories and portrayals to the screen but do so better than anybody else could.Eastwood and Siegel started their collaborations a few years before in 1968 with the film Coogans Bluff, a film where the good cop was literally a modern day cowboy who was a tough and merciless as the bad guys themselves.The character of Coogan must have stayed within the psyche of both Eastwood and Siegel however as the character of 'Dirty' Harry Callaghan bears more than just a passing resemblance and they found the perfect vehicle in which to resurrect him.By 1971 the social situation in America had digressed to the point where victims rights were being overlooked because, murderers, rapists, drug dealers and kidnappers who were also human beings also had rights that were considered just as important.Many high profile cases had seen criminals acquitted to reoffend, all because their 'rights' were violated through some bureaucratic technicality and people were quite rightly getting angrier.Dirty Harry sets out to redress the balance. As in Coogans Bluff, Eastwood plays a cop who is more akin to a western lawman than anything suited to contemporary San Francisco.He wants results and cares more about getting the job done rather than how it is achieved. You step out of line around Harry you're just going to end up dead punk!The plot involves a psychotic serial killer, blackmailing the city, and leaving a trail of bodies in his wake. The city want to cooperate with his demands to stop more people getting killed, Harry wants to find the killer himself and deal with him in his own way...in order to stop more people being killed.You see many times throughout the movie where Harry has run ins with his superiors who want to namby pamby their way around the situation whilst Harry believes the longer they dick around with this guy the more people are going to get hurt.One poignant scene is where the killer has kidnapped a 14 year old girl and buried her alive. Time is running out to find out where she is before her oxygen runs out...Harry with anger and desperation for the girls welfare clearly etched in his face literally tortures the wounded perp until he finally gives up the information he needs to save her.The next scene sees that his arrest, his evidence and the killers confession will all be thrown out as inadmissible due the way it was obtained and the killer is going to be set free.\"That man had rights\" says the DA\"What about (the girl)? She's raped and left in a hole to die, what about her rights? Who speaks for her?\" replies a frustrated Harry, hardly believing what he is hearing.The film was a huge hit and I said at the beginning of this review it started off a decade long run of hard boiled loose canon cop movies, but it was not without us detractors.Many called it fascist or right wing, citing that the police had no right to be Jury, Judge and executioner. Many of the original intended stars (which incidentally included Frank Sinatra, John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and Charles Bronson) turned it down for this very reason.I personally do not find it so, for however brutal Harry Callaghan seems at times, you know his actions all stem from his desire to save lives and protect innocent people from the actions of evil people. There is nothing wrong with wanting to do that.I think if there is a moral to the story at all, it is that if you don't want to be shot and tortured by a cop don't kidnap 14 year old girls and bury them alive... under those circumstances the Dirty Harry's of this world, no matter how dirty they are, will pose no threat to you whatsoever.Don Siegel would leave the Dirty Harry franchise after just this one outing, but Clint would go on to make 4 sequels over the next 18 years featuring Harry Callaghan. He was not only the character Eastwood would become most associated with but a character that has become one of the most iconic in movie history.",

Dirty Harry is a 1971 crime thriller film produced and directed by Don Siegel, starring Clint Eastwood, Harry Guardino and Reni Santori. This was the first in the Dirty Harry series. Clint Eastwood plays the title role, in his first outing as San Francisco Police Department Inspector \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan.SUMMARY: A serial killer who calls himself \"Scorpio\" (Andy Robinson) murders a young woman in a San Francisco high-rise rooftop swimming pool using a high-powered rifle from the top of the 555 California Street skyscraper. When SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) investigates, he finds a spent shell casing and a ransom message from the killer, promising more deaths if the city does not pay him $100,000. The chief of police, with the agreement of the Mayor (John Vernon), assigns Harry to the case and arranges for extra support. Later, Harry waits for his lunch in a local caf\u00e9, but notices a robbery-taking place at a nearby bank and tells the caf\u00e9 owner to call the police and report an armed robbery in progress. While he waits for reinforcements, the robbers emerge from the bank, forcing Harry to confront them alone. During the confrontation, Harry utters to one of the robbers: The next day, Harry is assigned a rookie partner, Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni). Harry notes that his partners always get injured (or worse), and that he needs someone experienced, but the Chief gives him no choice. A police helicopter foils Scorpio's second attempt at murder while he is targeting a black man in a park, but Scorpio escapes. The next night, he manages to kill a young boy from another rooftop. Since Scorpio's last victim was a black man, the police believe Scorpio will pursue a Catholic priest as his next victim; feeling \"owed\" one for the disruption of his earlier attempt. The police set up a sting, with teams on rooftops throughout the city, but leaving the rooftop Scorpio used in his disrupted murder attempt clear, and providing a target of opportunity, a priest at the Saint Peter and Paul Church. Harry and Chico wait for Scorpio on an adjacent rooftop, Harry with a high-powered rifle and Chico with a spotlight. When Scorpio appears, a shootout ensues but he eventually escapes, killing a police officer. Infuriated that his plans have twice been foiled, Scorpio kidnaps a teenage girl, rapes her and buries her alive. He contacts the city and demands twice his previous ransom, giving the city until 3 a.m. the following morning, when the girl's air will run out. The mayor decides to pay, and tells Harry to deliver the money to a location at the docks with no back up. Without permission, Harry wears a wire, has Chico follow him, and tapes a knife to his shin. When Harry reaches the drop point, Scorpio contacts him through a public payphone, sending Callahan on a journey between various pay phones in the city, in order to separate the inspector from any back up that he may have. However, Harry's wire allows Chico to follow him. The chase ends when Harry reaches an enormous cross at Mount Davidson, one of the city's parks. Scorpio instructs Harry to drop his gun and the money, then to face the cross and stand up against it. Scorpio then proceeds to beat Harry before revealing that he has \"changed his mind\" and is going to let the girl die anyway, and kill Harry as well. Chico arrives at the scene and shoots at Scorpio, saving Harry. Chico is shot, in the ensuing shootout. While Scorpio is distracted, Harry stabs him in the leg with his concealed knife. Scorpio screams hysterically and escapes without the money. Chico survives his wound, but tells Harry he will be resigning from the force.QUESTIONS Why did Harry have to get a new partner? Why was Harry looking for the doctor that treated Scorpio? Why was Scorpio living and working in nearby Kezar Stadium? Why did Harry stand on Scorpio injured leg? Why Debralee Scott body was found overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge? Why was Scorpio release from all charges? MY THOUGHTS: This was the beginning of the Dirty Harry ERA. This movie kept you on the edge of your sit right from the beginning. I thought Andy Robinson did a good job as his role as the bad guy. Once again however this was a movie that no leading lady. Sure, there was a lot of action. However, it takes more than action in my eyes to be an excellent movie. In my eyes, a movie must have a leading lady if it wants to get 10 weasel stars. Since this movie had no leading lady I can give this s movie 8 weasel stars at best.",

I'm not sure if this is the first film to do it, but its definitely the earliest film I've seen it in.  Dirty Harry is the original bad ass good guy; I've dabbled in the character's other films like The Enforcer, etc but never the original......and I must say it's a pretty damn good movie.  It's intriguing throughout; the 'Scorpio' character is as creepy as it gets.  You just get such a good and relieving feeling when Dirty Harry finally gets him in the end.  Clint Eastwood fits the Dirty Harry character perfectly; the now famous 'do you feel lucky' line is absolutely classic.

This was the pivotal point in Clint's career that would make him a legend I believe, even more of an impetus than the 'man with no name' trilogy. In Dirty Harry, Clint defined his charisma and the secured the monumental franchise.Yes, I grew up in the 70's and watched Eastwood's movies and especially loved Dirty Harry for the same reasons why any other red blooded kid would. Clint's style is what makes him and this movie so magnetic. With his classic and signature steely-eyed grin, whispering voice and stoic righteousness, that in itself is just the surface. Harry Callahan is a no nonsense cop out to mend justice with his unorthodox approach. But technically this makes him a rebel to a flawed legal system that inadvertently protects the perpetrators and bad guys.So the argument that this is a right winged biased approach to law and order is faulty due to the fact that Harry is actually a rebel and defies the ineffective system that is confined to so many left winged statuetes.Dirty Harry is basically a cop movie which the plot is fuelled by the hateful murderer and the justice sought by one man, Harry Callahan. It's a beautiful and gritty film with all of it's inner city backdrops of San Francisco. The hippie era had reached status quo by the early 70's and I could see how the theme of the story took political chances.But it's a good cop movie. The murders are realistic, the violence still holds up and the tension builds inevitably as the denouement face off between Scorpio and Harry's chase scene reached its climax.Unfortunately the sequels relied to heavily on political pundits for justice. We don't need to be taught these elementary lessons on morality and that is what gets old to me. It's more interesting, as in the original Dirty Harry, to see a portrait of a lawman face adversity when trying to uphold what is right and what is fair in an unfair legal system, only to be hindered by the laws and police hierarchy.",

The dialogue is fast and witty, whilst there are enough action scenes to keep things flowing. The soundtrack is very 70s and whilst the tunes can only be described as weak, they at least create an atmosphere of sorts. Eastwood doesn't mince his words in this picture, a very uncompromising cop being portrayed. The Magnum 44 steals the film, its awesome sound and power making for acres of entertainment. The legendary 'do you feel lucky punk' quote of Eastwood also makes its first appearance in this movie. Overall a great offering and one of the 70s better films.",

All 5 are great but it is the original that I keep coming back to. Everything about this movie is well done and entertaining. The period soundtrack is wonderful. The streets of San Francisco are practically a player in the movie. Great shots of the city circa 1971 abound. Scorpio is the perfect bad guy. You can't wait to see him get his. Despite Clint Eastwood's many movie roles, and especially his westerns like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Harry Callahan is his best character in my opinion. He gives Harry just the right amount of humor and humanity so you know that Harry is just human and not some superhero. When Harry and his .44 Magnum are in town, the bad guys better watch out.

He follows no rules, but gets the job done. he has he's own sense of justice and this gets him in trouble with the law. On the other hand, he saves life, and get's the crooks off the street. So the main question is, does the cause justify the means? I think everyone have heard of Diry Harry, and he's the character most people think of when they hear the name Clint Eastwood.

Harry is a widow and doesnt like most people - especially criminals - and certainly doesn't like regulations. Harry has a background of cutting corners and not following said regulations.Scorpio (Andrew Robinson - known for his role as Garak in Star Trek) preys on the police and baits them for ransoms, kills four people (two children) and hijacks a school bus. Scorpio knows how to play the ever more regulation heavy system, baiting the loose cannon Harry into stepping over his mark as a police officer, affording Scorpio more freedom and release from prison.A new world is opening up, and changes are coming to law enforcement - more and more suspects know their rights - so an old-school cop comes into conflict with a new breed of killer and new rules on how he is meant to operate.The film is more about Clint Eastwood's attitude and demeanour more than anything else. The Scorpio killer is not really compelling, feels more like a comic book killer than a real life killer. A times it seems like he is just there to test the waters of new police regulations than actually having a motif. There is a nice polar opposite feeling between the cool, slow, unconventional Harry, and the bumbling maniac.The film suffers from realism here and there - Harry never does paperwork; his superiors are more willing to allow him to act as he pleases and just give him a drink and telling off; he is allowed to carrying weapons that are not service standards etc.Clint Eastwood is super cool in it - and there are many bad-ass scenes (like the bank robbery segment at the start). Its an anti-regulation, anti-liberal, anti-criminal piece.There are some creative shots, and some creative direction and writing - very little dialogue; the viewer learns about Harry through his actions and the lack of normal behaviours, e.g. He doesnt have a partner as his partner is in hospital, but we dont see or learn about this much. Has a sense of mystery due to these bits and pieces.Worth watching if you like the shoot-em-up style of westerns and city based thrillers.",

But Eastwood got there first.\"Dirty Harry\" also created the concept of the \"action hero\":  Bronson, Gibson, Nolte -- sure.  But also Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Segal, Van Damme. \"Dirty Harry\" also inaugurated the \"evil psycho villain\" movie. Henceforth, villains would stop at nothing, and audiences would demand their gruesome payback deaths.  There's no reason to understand the villainous killer/rapist/extortionist Scorpio, no reason to want anything for him other than death:  he kills women, children, priests.  He hijacks school buses. He buries a girl alive after doing unspeakable things to her.  From here on out, movie villains would be evil, incarnate.  \"Dirty Harry\" started it all, but there's a big surprise within it: it is one of the greatest movie thrillers ever made, thanks to skilled director Don Siegel (\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" \"The Shootist,\" \"Charley Varrick\") Siegel's skill with images, editing, and narrative give \"Dirty Harry\" the feel of a film noir turned horror movie, nowhere more evident than in the long, central sequence where Harry must run a gauntlet through nighttime San Francisco trying to get ransom to Scorpio before the buried girl dies.   This is one of the most harrowing, suspenseful, and dynamic sequences ever filmed, as hero, villain and .357 Magnum meet in deserted SF Kezar Stadium in the dead of night.\"Do ya feel lucky, punk?\" is a great speech, first in the film's early, light-hearted action sequence, and then in the dead-serious finale.A hell of a movie.

First of all some of the dialogues are still and always be memorable. Secondly there are some great acting skills that still impress today.

Everyone must know the plot by now: tough cop Harry Callaghan ( Eastwood) is assigned to catch a psychopathic serial killer, Scorpio, played by Andrew Robinson, whose innocent and clown like features make the role more chilling.Basically Harry has little time for the hippyish liberal philosophies that were taking hold in America at the start of the seventies- Dirty Harry is filmed in a San Francisco just coming out of the hippy era and ironically Scorpio wears some hippyish clothes- and is a tough cop of the old school who believes violent criminals should be hunted down and, if necessary, killed off. No wonder in America, which was suffering a big increase in crime when Dirty Harry was released, the character proved popular with millions of Americans even if one critic predictably referred to the film as fascist for its brutal approach to solving crime. However, who is the real fascist: a decent cop trying to stop a psychopathic killer on the rampage or Scorpio,the serial killer terrorising San Francisco.From the opening credits where a young woman is gunned down in a swimming pool to the end where Scorpio is blown away by the most powerful handgun in the world, the action never lets up and both Eastwood and Robinson play excellent roles. Dirty Harry, even if you have seen it a million times, will always make your day and spawned four excellent sequels that are just as good as the original. If you can, try and watch all five of the Harry Callaghan films as the characterisation is fantastic and the wisecracks as good as anything from James Bond.",

Once he is caught, Harry violates the murderer's civil rights which leave the police no choice but to let him go free. When the madman hijacks a school bus full of children, Harry is called on once again. Eastwood is perfect in the title role, as he creates one of the most memorable characters in movie history. Harry carries himself with a cool, suave, and in-control disposition. He's intimidating but definitely likable. Don Siegel's direction is terse and suspenseful. He doesn't waste time in giving us the goods from start to finish. The great dialogue is also accompanied by an eerie jazzy electronic score by Lalo Schifrin. I found this kind of ghostly sound to be used in many other crime thrillers of the day. Siegel provides us with an interesting look at how one man defies the law and takes matters into his own hands.

Harry Callahan (Eastwood) sees it a different way.... Callahan doesn't like seeing killers get their way and he really doesn't like Scorpio. The Mayor, Chief of Police and any other authority thats in Harry's way are determined to appease the killer in order to hopefully desist this carnage from going on any longer, Harry again sees things a different way. The mayhem that ensues is just cinematic genius and an unbelievable script that will keep you compelled from beginning to end.

Harry stop Scorpio (the killer). In between Harry gets to foil a few other crimes - my favorite being the hilarious scene where Harry talks down a man from committing suicide. This is a prime example of some the delicious black humor running through \"Dirty Harry\", that helps elevate it above the dross. The main killer is particularly effective because of the way Robinson portrays him, as if a wild man is trapped inside a normal citizen. The killings themselves are violent and brutal and perfectly match the film's gritty nature.Eastwood suits the dry, sarcastic, down-beat Harry to a tee as he's perfected all the looks necessary over his career. He's a cop you don't ever want to mess with. His partner - who have previously had the career of a Spinal Tap drummer - plays surprisingly well off him, considering the circumstances, even if his fate is somewhat inevitable.I'd recommend \"Dirty Harry\" to any fans of the cop genre, as Dirty Harry - the cop, not the movie - is a great character.",

This thought that you - and not some institutions controlled by some snobbish politicians and demagogues - can decide what's wrong and right and act in this way is a short pleasure that you can't allow yourself in real life but have part of through fiction.

He speaks up, yet keeps to himself; it truly is a testimony to how perfectly and toughly the script was written. So when a sadistic psychopath is loose killing innocent victims in San Fransico, who else could be assigned to the case?

Later Dirty Harry movies has more bad guys, but they add little or nothing, they are more or less paper thin sidekicks that are done away with with a quick bang.Casting is also just great. Many movies, not least new ones, have so bad casting that it takes an effort to tell characters apart. Not here. All leading characters are razor sharp and also doing their job flawlessly. Even some small parts (Albert Popwell, had parts in all 4 Dirty Harry movies) are impressing.And to add the last spice, the movie has a great one-liner, used with perfection, so good that Dirty Harry 2 opened with it.I find very little that I don't like. Police movies are not all that interesting as a theme, tend to land around 4-7 for me. Not this. Great stuff.",

            "content": "I first saw Dirty Harry round about the same time the fourth film 'Sudden Impact' was released, which was either 1983 or 1984. This film is perfect.This is THE film that gave Clint Eastwood his signature role and movie immortality. This film is to cop thrillers what Star Wars is to sci-fi, like all great movies there are many moments and images that stay in the mind long after you have seen the picture.Classic moments: The opening sequence, the rooftop Sniper called Scorpio taking aim at a young woman swimming on a skyscraper pool; just listen to Lalo Schfirin's haunting and murderous music scored in perfect timing to the movement of the two characters (her swimming, him aiming at her through his rifle lens). brilliant.2nd classic moment: Harry running around San Francisco with a yellow gym bag filled with $200,000, running from phone booth to phone booth on the instructions of the Sniper in order to save a young girl that the Sniper has kidnapped. The sequence comes to a head at Mount Davidson Park at a huge monument called 'The Cross' where Harry is almost kicked to death by a red ski-masked Scorpio, and Scorpio shows his true nature by changing his mind and letting the girl die of slow suffocation. When Harry finally catches him at the Kezar stadium, and tortures Scorpio i defy anybody to forget this moment a year after seeing it.The ending is simple good guy versus bad guy,which for future generations i will not type here for although Dirty Harry was released in 1971, for me personally, it is timeless and in the time to come those future generations will see this film and maybe, just maybe, they will know that for all your Bad Boys and Lethal weapons out there, nothing will come close to the power of Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry.",

The way things ended up in the movie I think was pretty accurate to what happens in real life with real cops. Also with the court systems. Like how they didn't even try him. So Clint ended up shooting him in the end which is what needed to happen in the first place. They don't act fast enough. They let people die because of it. Sometimes they cant help it but if they did hurry things up they can always help to save more people. I think there is a lot of cops who do wanna do what Clint does and take matters into there own hands. Which sometimes wouldn't be the best thing but sometimes I think it is necessary. I think that some of the parts were funny and over all was a great watch for people who like justice type movies or just action films.",

That still influence us today, even after 35 years. Dirty Harry.I guarantee, if you like action, and a cop with a bad-ass attitude( sorry about the language), you'll love (even though he hates you) Dirty Harry. \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan is a tough San Francisco Cop, who hates criminals and scumbags who breaks the law and gets away with it, while he himself hates the law also, but obeys it anyway. His most famous quotes that everyone loves is this.... \"I know what you're thinking punk. You're thinking did he fire 6 shots or only 5? Well to tell you the truth I've forgotten myself in all this excitement. But being this a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off. You've got to ask yourself a question; Do I feel lucky? Well do you punk? *BANG*The plot so far is about a sniper, who calls himself Scorpio, (who is loosely based on the Zodiac Killer, around that time) is killing people around the San Francisco and holds the city at ransom, or more people will die. He is portrayed by Andrew Robinson, and does a stunning job as acting as Dirty Harry's first nemesis in the film. Dirty Harry is at the case to nail him, no matter what. The success of this movie has spawned 4 sequels, and since then became a legacy of one of the greatest cop movies of all time, even to this day. Of course there is a rumor I heard saying there could be a 6th Dirty Harry coming, but I think it's false....but then again... I'd say this...\"Go ahead, make my day\"",

The screenplay is more or less unforgettable with line after line of punch, scene after scene of excitement, all coming to the fore in the film's climatic scene.

            "content": "Clint Eastwood epitomized toughness for two decades, and his iconoclastic anti-hero persona is on full display in 1971's Dirty Harry, my personal all-time favorite movie. While criticized at the time for its violence, and a cop's disregard for individual rights and \"right wing\" theme, Dirty Harry was nonetheless appreciated by those tired of rampant crime and lawlessness in many of the nation's cities. A revolutionary film, \"DH\" illustrates the frustration felt by both the general public and those in law enforcement with a system that too often weighs in favor of the criminal rather than the victim. It is a theme that is just as relevant today, and Eastwood perfectly conveys this concept by waging a one man war against a criminal totally devoid of humanity or viewer sympathy.When a crazed killer terrorizes San Francisco, Detective \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan is assigned to the case. Fed up with red tape and ineffective \"traditional\" police procedures, Callahan pulls out all stops to nab the killer- disregarding Miranda and Escobito procedures which are the linchpin of our system of jurisprudence. Andrew Robinson's portrayal of killer \"Scorpio\" is indeed a tour de force- one of the screen's best ever villains that stands up 38 years later. His performance is even more remarkable given the knowledge that Robinson in real life is a softspoken, peace loving man with a disdain for guns. Fine support is offered by veteran actors Harry Guardino, John Vernon and John Larch, all staples of 60's and 70's television. Lalo Schifrin's creepy score fits the theme perfectly and Don Siegel's direction is excellent.Dirty Harry spurred four sequels and cemented Eastwood's reputation as a box office titan. One of the best movies of the 70's and an all-time classic.",

            "content": "The key to understanding the immense success and popularity of Dirty Harry lies in its location: San Francisco. With its reputation for being an official sponsor of political and cultural liberalism, San Francisco was already at that time becoming seen as the new enemy in American society, and Siegel's attack on it is remorseless.Compare Dirty Harry with two previous Siegel films: Coogan's Bluff and Madigan (both 1968) and it immediately becomes clear why Siegel's 1971 film touched a nerve his previous attempts did not. Both set in New York the enemy is embodied in an individual and the plot centres on the usual problems faced by cops pursuing those who operate outside the law. These are without doubt exciting action movies, but deprived of any wider social context within which success can be established they failed to gain the notoriety Dirty Harry succeeded in gaining.With Dirty Harry we must remember that Scorpio, though clearly evil, is not Harry's main enemy. It is the collective efforts of the defense attorneys, judges and politicians who allow Scorpio to walk the streets a free man which cause the biggest problems for our hero. Similarly, this dichotomy on which the narrative depends cannot be successfully resolved merely in a confrontation between Harry and Scorpio. Whoever wins, the liberal establishment still stands. Knowing this, Harry's final act as a cop comes as no surprise.At the close of the 60s the Western - which had defined America since John Wayne portrayed the Ringo Kid in 1939 - was running out of steam and destructively turning in on itself (in violent Peckinpah style). Western actors (Eastwood and Wayne) moved to cop thrillers (Dirty Harry and McQ), and crime became the new prism through which American society could be understood. By portraying the establishment itself as the biggest criminal, Siegel is clearly reflecting the views of a society ill at ease.(Originally published on IMDb 24 October 1998 under an ID that has since been deleted)",

I believe Dirty Harry to be as much as an exploitation/political statement as much as it is a feature film. It's the dirty, hard gritty grimy slummy nasty scum riddled streets of San Francisco. The film se7en is also all of the above (bar the setting), but se7en raises the bar in terms of violence, and so it falls out of the category that Dirty Harry has created for itself and stands alone in.Clint Eastwood portrays Harry Callahan, a tough, un-compromising homicide cop whose first case is the murder of a woman in the scope of the infamous Scorpio killer. The plot is very straight forward and requires no hard thinking whatsoever. The plot is in fact as far as I am concerned secondary. It is the 'tour' we are taken on shot in a very basic documentarian fashion. It's eye though highly polished cannot hide its grain, even on Blu Ray disk. It is that which perhaps holds the most significance.There are no fancy camera angles, no special effects, no sunshine and flowers. This is a hard 70's cop film that pulls no punches whatsoever. The violence though strong is not stylalised. The images we see are dark and cold and the music that accompanies is of sadness when not picking up that famous 70's pace.The story takes us down the alleys and backstreets, into peoples lives where vice and homosexuality and cop hate are rampant. Everything is sordid and there is little in the way of humour or romance. That said, it contains the very famous monologue in the beginning that is mirrored in the end and in my opinion, part of what elevates this piece of cinema to it's status.In the beginning Callahan is mocking, being smart with the crook who's bank heist he foiled with the 44 magnum. In the end, his expression and actions complete a full circle. Yet there is no happy music and victory. He has stopped (by playing against the rules) the truly infamous bastard of a homicidal maniac. Andrew Robinson is Oscar worthy. I don't know if he received an accolade for this. I'm guessing that upon release the film had to surf an onslaught of political outrage. Harry does not save the girl, her limp naked body is pulled from the drainage and the evils of mankind are realised.To summarise, it's an important film. It is hard cinema, but for the discerning palette it is a must watch must own if only on the principle of being a film fan.",

            "content": "Arguably Clint Eastwood's signature film, and certainly my favorite of his films, Clint (San Francisco Detective \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan) Eastwood pursues a vicious and heartless killer, but he (Dirty Harry) finds himself fighting the political bureaucracy throughout his manhunt.Perhaps not the movie to originate the \"catch-phrase,\" this film certainly made it famous, and other, subsequent films also contained classic, memorable Eastwood phrases (i.e., \"Go ahead--make my day!\" of \"Sudden Impact.\")  This movie tastefully had our hero utter the phrase just twice, hence preventing us from tiring of it.  This minimization of use, coupled with the phrase's actual contents, and topped off by Eastwood's inimitable style, makes this one of the most memorable catch-phrases in movie history: \"I know what you're thinking--did I fire six shots, or only five?  To tell you the truth, through all this excitement, I've kind of lost track myself. But being this is a forty-four magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, that would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question--'Do I feel lucky?'-- Well, do ya', punk?\"The movie has plenty of action, excitement, and suspense.  Andrew Robinson is dead on target playing \"Scorpio,\" a psychopathic sniper who attempts to extort San Francisco, in exchange for cessation of his murdering spree. Several chilling scenes provide plenty of satisfying movie-watching, and most are well-scripted and well-acted.Unlike the majority of today's movies, this one's ending is just as compelling as its individual scenes, and this final sequence serves to punctuate the film even further.  It's a joy to view a well-balanced film, and to be as pleased and as moved by the ending, as by the film's individual scenes.  So common is it to sit through an apparently soundly constructed, intriguing movie, only to be vastly disappointed by an incongruent or nonsensical ending, to ultimately cheapen or destroy the film.  On the contrary, this ending delivers, satisfies, and leaves us yearning for more--which we do get in the less enjoyable, albeit above average sequel, \"Magnum Force.\"The original and one of the best 70's super-cop movies, \"Dirty Harry\" is a must-see for anyone who missed it, or for any of the younger generation who will undoubtedly appreciate this vintage film.As an aside, even though Andrew Robinson played the role of the killer with great style and a with a very distinct presence, I think the ultimate person for the part would have been Dennis Hopper. Just imagine Dennis in this role!I would rate this movie a 7.9 out of 10 over-all, but for its time, for many individual trend-setting nuances, and for its uniqueness in the \"super-cop movie\" genre, that rating would be nearly a 10.",

            "content": "I first saw \"Dirty Harry\" back in the 1980s and I never get tired of watching it. It's so well-made that it's always a pleasure to watch. The script is one of the best Hollywood scripts ever and is filled with unforgettable characters, dialogue and action scenes.According to the Mayor of San Francisco (the great John Vernon), \"there's a madman loose.\" The madman in question is a serial killer called Scorpio (he is also a paedophile, a rapist, a thief and an extortionist). Enter his opponent - unconventional cop Inspector Harry Callahan. From the start it's clear that Harry does things his way and resents authority, but he's a good cop and is let loose to hunt down Scorpio.It's in the conflict between Harry and Scorpio that the movie really comes into its own. They are equals in many ways, both are expert marksmen, both are control freaks and both enjoy sadistic games (Harry taunts suspects to go for their gun if they think he's out of bullets, a kind of variation on Russian Roulette. Scorpio kidnaps and buries a young girl and he runs Harry from one phone booth to another, if Harry misses one call, she dies. It turns out she was dead all along and Harry was wasting his time.) It could also be argued that Harry is as crazy as Scorpio, just look at his face when he steps on Scorpio's wounded leg in the football stadium to get him to confess the buried girl's whereabouts. Yet they are different in that they are on opposite sides of the law.Like Buffalo Bill in \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" Scorpio is a fictionalized version of a real killer. The Zodiac Killer terrorized Northern California in the late 60s and was still at large when this movie came out (he has never been caught to this day). In one of his infamous taunting letters to the press, he claimed he would shoot a bus full of children. Although Zodiac never carried out that threat, Scorpio makes good on it in this movie by hijacking a school bus with children on board (while Scorpio never kills any of them, he has already killed a young black boy and raped and killed a young girl earlier in the film, so it's quite possible he could have harmed the kids had Harry not intervened).Andy Robinson has a field day playing Scorpio and he never really got a role that good again and it's a pity. Clint Eastwood suggested him to Don Siegel after seeing him in a stage play.John Wayne and Frank Sinatra were once in the running to play Harry Callahan - Wayne passed, Sinatra injured his hand. Thank God for that, Clint Eastwood was never better than in this and the role of Harry fits him like a glove (if you want to see what Wayne and Sinatra would have been like, check out \"McQ\" and \"The First Deadly Sin\" respectively.)The running gag throughout the movie is the reason why Callahan is called Dirty Harry. Another cop gives his theory that it's because Harry \"hates everybody\" and goes on to list all the racial slurs for those types of people. Harry himself, after stopping a suicidal jumper, explains that he's Dirty Harry because he gets \"every sh*t job that comes along.\" Another possible explanation for Harry's nickname comes in two scenes where he voyeuristically spies on naked girls while tracking Scorpio (this voyeurism is another way he is like Scorpio, the movie begins with Scorpio watching a girl swimming in a rooftop pool through a telescopic sight and Harry even follows Scorpio to a strip joint later on).There is a fascinating example of how primitive criminal profiling was back in 1971. The chief of police makes a throwaway comment about how \"sick guys\" rob the same place many times. Today, forensics and profilers would be all over this case from the first murder and Harry's old-fashioned leg work would take a back seat.The subtext of Dirty Harry is really about the beginnings of Political Correctness and how old school cop Harry is unable and unwilling to conform to it. Harry would have begun his career as a cop when police brutality and racism were the norm and confessions were routinely beaten out of suspects. He gets a rude awakening when he tries that heavy-handed tactic on Scorpio and is berated by his superiors for it. It's clearly a shock for him; the other shock is that Scorpio goes free because Harry never got a warrant even though the dogs in the street know he's guilty as hell. It leads to the famous finale in which Harry, having cut through the bureaucracy and killed Scorpio, realizes he can no longer function as a cop in the system and throws his badge into the water. Box office success would dictate that Harry would get a replacement badge for four sequels. None of those movies could touch the original \"Dirty Harry\" (although the first half hour of \"Sudden Impact\" came close to matching it and gave us that other classic Harry line \"Go ahead, make my day.\"). \"Dirty Harry\" remains an all-time classic nearly 40 years after its release and it remains my favorite Clint Eastwood movie and his best collaboration with director Don Siegel.",

            "review_title": "An Interesting Contradiction...",
            "content": "Don Siegel is part of a dead breed, the pulp filmmaker. They don't really exist anymore as film has become overrun with auteurs and popular films. Such directors like Quentin Tarantino, S. Craig Zahler, and to a lesser extent Eli Roth have attempted to replicate the effects of the 'pulp filmmaker' movement, to varying levels of success. The superhero films of now could be considered something of the 'pulp' age of films, but they don't quite capture the edge that the original pulp films had back in their day.Dirty Harry came out 5 years before Scorsese would put the vigilante sub-genre to rest with Taxi Driver, a complete deconstruction and tearing down of the genre, showing the vigilante as he would really be: a pitiful, alienated loner, lashing out at society and yet unable to find that the issues that he struggles with might be because of things that he can't control. No one was ever able to make a good vigilante film afterwards, and even some of the later Dirty Harry films struggled with the fallout from Taxi Driver, its impact and influence are inescapable.But Dirty Harry is interesting, as it doesn't quite lean into the more escapist, power fantasy aspects of Death Wish, it very much is a product of its time. It was made as the infamous Zodiac killings were being investigated, and coming after a decade where hope was smashed time and time again with the assassinations of figures like John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr. It very much has the angst and anguish that came from the age before it. It has a raw anger and bitterness that can be felt throughout the film, and it's that hard edge that keeps it intriguing even after all of these years.Dirty Harry often goes back and forth from forcing you to confront harsher realities of the world to creating a new form of sensationalism with its more 'badass' moments. Clint Eastwood is iconic in the titular role: he's hard, cold, and steely in his conviction. He would be an ideal, yet he's hardly a man. He's a force of nature who seeks to avenge the wrongs of the world, and there is a certain escapism to it. But Siegel never seeks to glamorize Harry or anything that happens in this film. The violence and suspense built throughout the film are usually played to be horrific and intense, rather than something to be celebrated and cheered on. I was also surprised by the ponderous nature that it sometimes showcased, a trend that would be carried on in its post-Taxi Driver sequel Sudden Impact, though it was unfortunate to see the other films go on to become more like the other films of the vigilante genre.I'm surprised the so called 'cancel culture' of today hasn't gotten their hands on this film yet or the other ones that it followed, considering it's a film that teeters with celebrating police brutality and vigilantism, it often attracts reactionaries and boomers, who take the themes and ideas explored in the film and adapts them into their own short sighted ideologies, but I'm still surprised that in our more enlightened age that we haven't been asked to leave this film in the past and move forward, yet I don't think that it ever will. Its impact on popular culture is too great to be ignored.Dirty Harry is a neat contradiction, walking the line between entertainment and subversive artistic prowess. It's very much of the pulp film era, it's too interesting to be discarded, yet too of its time to be timeless.",

Visually, the film resembles an adult comics series with fine attention to lighting details. Very well filmed in the way cameras are used too. Great choice of sets. Great atmosphere, sometimes we really feel in the 70's at San Francisco. Sometimes the all dark screen is a bit too prolonged.

            "content": "Recently deceased Hunter S. Thompson claimed that Nixon lifted a policy against showing R-rated films in the White House theatre so that he could see Dirty Harry. (According to Dennis Bingham's book 'Acting Male') 'Dirty Harry' was one of many collaborations between director Don Siegel and star Clint Eastwood. Indeed, Harry Callahan bears numerous similarities with the character of Coogan from the Siegel/Eastwood offering 'Coogan's Bluff' (1968). The pair both get the 'dirty' jobs, and both go above and beyond the call of duty to get their man.The first in five 'Dirty' Harry films opens with a roof top sniping. Eastwood is soon on the case, tracking down the mysterious and dangerous Scorpio, who wants money or else he'll kill again. The ransom isn't paid, and Scorpio continues killing and even kidnapping - crossing Harry more than once, and injuring him in the process. Harry catches up with Scorpio, beats him, and then Scorpio is let go because of police brutality; leading to the school bus kidnap and the now iconic shoot-out.Harry can be seen as a reactionary figure, who disobeys all law to bring his own brand of justice to the streets. Indeed, it is strangely ironic that the counter-culture was a part of society Harry disliked and 'punished' (homosexuals, hippies etc) and yet they were part of the main fan base for the film. Harry presented the dichotomy of law enforcement figure, who was willing to bend the law to get justice. Something that appealed both to the likes of Nixon (although hardly the most law abiding citizen) and 'hippies'. And this aspect could be one reason for the films success.Furthermore, police in the US invited both Eastwood and Siegel to speak at functions because of the film, reading the movie as one which contained a wholly pro-police force message.Eastwood is brilliantly stoic and 'hard' as the iconic Harry, whilst Andy Robinson is delightfully manic as the rooftop killer and kidnapper Scorpio. There is also a brief but memorable cameo from Siegel and Dirty 'Harry' regular Albert Popwell (who appears in every 'Harry' film except 'The Dead Pool').Pauline Kael famously dislikes the film, calling it fascist, which led to numerous other critics agreeing with this verdict. However, both 'Rolling Stone' and 'Time' film critic raved about the movie. 'Time' man Jay Cocks even named it on his top ten list for the year! I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and whilst I see the 'fascism' in the film, can easily rise above this and enjoy it for what it is. Ten out of ten.",

With a strong performance, knock-out dialogues and super-cool attitude, he is bound to leave a mesmerizing effect. Andy Robinson is good as the main villain too, especially in the freak out scene with kids in the bus.

Dealing with the endless red tape that comes from living and working in a bloated and spineless bureaucracy. Coming to terms with the frustrations that we all must face at some point in our lives.PROS AND CONS This film is iconic. It set the standard for the 'new' cop/buddy films that were to follow it like a stampede. Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, L.A. Confidential and a slew of others owe their origins to this film. This film solidified Clint Eastwood as a major presence in Hollywood.This is a film that we have all seen (probably numerous times). It has been a staple of television and cable for years. However, the version I watched on Laserdisc was the uncut original film that I don't believe is seen much these days. This film is easily censored and shortened in order to make more time for commercials and to fit into a 2 hour time slot. After watching this version, there were scenes that I don't recall having seen in the past. Scenes that don't add to the plot, but do flush out the character of Harry Callahan more and make him more complex than I remembered.In this original version, Harry has a lot of inner demons and is not a nice guy. He is bigoted in a very politically incorrect way. There are racial slurs and references to ethnic stereotypes all through the film. There is also a lot of casual nudity in the background which is something that censors and advertises eagerly cut out to get this film on public television.Along with \"Bullitt\" (Steve McQueen's police drama, also set in San Francisco), this film redefined the role of the police from angelic and efficient protector of the populace to the anti-hero where the rogue cop fights not only crime but his own department to get the job done.Several things stand out in this film. First of all is the wonderful melding of Lalo Schifrin's musical score with John Surtee's camera work. They bring an intimate sense of voyeurism and hip-ness to 1970 San Francisco. Going back to when I first saw this film, I have always been impressed by Scorpio (the serial killer in the film) played by Andrew Robinson. Even at the age of 10 I was curious why he didn't get an Oscar nomination. He scared the bejesus out of me and still does.As with anything successful (Rocky, Die Hard, Rambo), this film spawned 4 follow-up works all staring Clint Eastwood. The later films are somewhat curious after seeing the first film. At the end of \"Dirty Harry\", Harry Callahan, throws away his badge and as he has hinted all throughout the film, gives up his life as a police officer. Having disobeyed the police commissioner, the mayor and his supervisor, it seems unlikely that they would have kept him on the force. But then again, box office receipts are a powerful motivator.",

Because of that, the police tend to keep him reserved for the most diabolical cases where they need a man who will bend the rules to get the job done (hence 'Dirty' - every dirty job that comes his way). After the precision shooting of a woman, Dirty Harry is assigned to the case. He soon finds out that there is a serial killer on the loose, who wants money to stop killing. The serial killer, known as Scorpio (Andrew Robinson), is a psychopath who knows no pity or remorse. When the city doesn't pay, he starts killing. Dirty Harry knows that the man won't stop, but is hampered by a flawed law system. A girl is then kidnapped and supposedly buried alive, and Dirty Harry lets lost his own psychotic side - one that matches Scorpio's. There are many messages in this film about the law, police officers, killers. But at a basic level, this film asks a very good question - what happens if a child is buried alive, has 5 hours to live and you know who the kidnapper is? That's the basic question asked. Harry goes much further than the law allows him, which in turn raises questions about the flawed law system, but also about why the police would hire someone like Harry in the first place. Is he literally hired to clean up the law's mess, or failures? Does he represent a total failure in the law system?The acting in this film is second to none. Clint Eastwood is perfectly cast as the ruthless Dirty Harry, and gives one of his truly iconic performances. He is then matched by the exceptional Andrew Robinson, who acted Scorpio so well that he received death threats in real life - he creates a character that you absolutely hate beyond all reason. And the direction and action in turn matches the acting. Don Siegel's relentless, level-headed direction keeps the action grounded and realistic. And the shot where Harry is waiting on the bridge for Scorpio is one of the best in cinema. Overall, this film is very, very good and iconic. Sometimes, the message is lost in the violence, or it becomes muddled. But it's enough to make you question the law system, and whether it's effective or not. And it's also enough to question how anyone would respond in desperation.",

This to me is basically cult cheesy, and I can't get past the terrible sound, completely irrational logic, and utter ridiculousness. For example (aside from police letting a killer walk in fthe first place): There was a promise of no molestation of the terrorist (it literally says that). Dirty Harry couldn't resist molesting the terrorist via school bus anyway (and we had to combine molesting with a school bus stunt really? Is that meant to be ironic somehow??). Plus, it's the 70s. There wasn't any technology available letting anyone know that it was an OK time for a cop off his rocker to take a dive onto a bus full of kids who were happily harboring a terrorist who was participating with them in a really annoying sing along.Is it quotable? sure. But in a way where I'm making fun, not because I'm overcome with awesomeness.I know I will get crap for this review but it's how I feel. Not just because it's old, I like some old movies.

This includes his role in \"Unforgiven\" for which he received an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Those of you who have, thus far, and plan to continue to avoid this flick based on the myriad of dreadful sequels that followed\u0085 don't! This is a very good crime drama.Trust me, there are no scenes where Eastwood walks down the middle of the street picking off armed criminals who are mesmerized on the sidelines like sitting ducks. As a matter of fact, he is actually quite vulnerable in a number of scenes. A good example is when four out of shape middle aged guys mistake him for a peeping tom. They nearly beat him senseless before his partner arrives on the scene to break it up. In the sequels I imagine he could have given these guys a stern round of stares, instantly sending each and every one of them into a coma.Andrew Robinson plays the role of the psychopath to a tee; his character is intriguing and genuinely creepy. The only thing that really bothered me about the story was one particular scene where a debate ensues between Eastwood's character and the district attorney, regarding probable cause versus the rights of the criminal. Based on what little I know about the law, Harry was at least partially right! Even if you're not fond of him, in any capacity, I think most of us have come to terms with the fact that Clint Eastwood is a better suited to direct films as opposed to acting in them, particularly at this point in his career.I'm sure that the sequels to \"Dirty Harry\" made millions, and in Hollywood you can't argue with that. Unfortunately in the process they tainted the reputation of a pretty good film.",

Harry is a hero or anti-hero, whatever : lonely and eternal as in all the mythologies. Harry represents individual conscience and ethics in a world of consuming mass : a new Cassandra and a rebel to unfair and stubborn authority. \"Dirty Harry\" is first an extention of the previous Don Siegel opus, \"Coogan's bluff\", and then a pioneer film which renews the genre due to its visual impact. The San Francisco location is superb and the cinematography is taut and smart. The Lalo Schifrin 's oppressive music is perfect and emphasizes the expressionist aspect of the film : the horror.

There not beautifully - looking policemen (one only has to take a look at the Mexican sidekick to dismiss that) or criminal masterminds. The psychotic sniper is, for once, actually psychotic. His behaviour is predicted beforehand by professionals and thus the audience become aware there is nothing disparate about this killer - the events could well be happening on the streets of San Francisco today. Right now. Thus the aforementioned sniper, 'Scorpio' is far more threatening and genuinely scary - the midnight meeting in the park between him and Eastwood is brilliantly tense. Some viewers may find themselves shrieking in horror on a red-masked Andrew Robinson's reaction to being brutally stabbed. An equal disturbance comes from when Scorpio's battered face first comes into view, made even more so by the fact he paid for someone to do this to him (and the realisation that sickos like this are de facto). It may not be saccharine enough for some tastes, but dirty Harry spawned one of the most quoted passages of dialogue ever committed to the big 'C', not to mention beginning the mainstreams obsession with maverick cops and introducing the world to the .44 magnum  - apparently it's 'the most powerful handgun in the world', or something.",

It's difficult for any viewer to completely identify with Harry Callahan. He is a brusque, laconic loner with seemingly little or no tolerance for people unlike himself. Scorpio, on the other hand, is a repellent monster with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. He has no scruples. He will kill anyone at anytime, and his total disregard of law enforcement makes him all the more frightening. Harry is the only character in the film that understands this, and is willing to break more than a few rules to stop this madman. Harry's superiors chastise him for his methods, and they capitulate with Scorpio's demands, with tragic results. In the end, Harry prevails, but the victory is hollow.

            "content": "There's an explanation as to why everybody names the seventies as the coolest decade of the 20th century, and one of those reasons is the 1971 film Dirty Harry. Of course, everyone knows this is the movie where a younger Clint Eastwood utters the iconic question, \"Do you feel lucky, punk?\" If you watch the whole film, you will find that this is the tip of a much bigger iceberg manifested as a superb and gratifying thriller.Starring as the irrepressible, cold and calculating Harry Callahan, Eastwood snatches the show and beckons us to follow him throughout the film. He exerts a commanding presence with his trademark swagger from beginning to end, in spite of the physical, moral and emotional hurdles thrown at him. If you haven't guessed it already, Dirty Harry is a character study, and has us rooting for Harry for the entire 102 minutes. Speaking of plot, I have to applaud the sagacious screenplay. Sure, the premise of a detective chasing a serial killer is simple, but that doesn't prevent the story from being engaging and above all, fun. You are definitely eager to see the son-of-a-bitch get defeated, but you are also surprised by the movie's investigation into the morality of the law itself. It's not as meditative as Citizen Kane, but the film is nonetheless one of the most intelligent action thrillers I've seen so far.Dirty Harry also boasts a tinkling score from the genius composer Lalo Schifrin, who is undeniably one of the greatest composers still walking the planet. While it's easy to see how other films have parodied the upbeat rhythms and suave harmonies that define his music, Schifrin's soundtrack doesn't distract the plot or character development, a directorial choice that I am a staunch supporter of. However, the film does suffer from amateur cinematography and lighting, along with a villain who failed to intimidate the audience as much as Darth Vader, the Joker or Hannibal Lecter. The frequent placement of Scorpio in dimly-lit locations, to me, felt like a cheap way of symbolising his malevolent nature. Luckily, this flaw fades like a dwindling ray, as it becomes clear how Dirty Harry is the OG for other 20th century action flicks like Lethal Weapon, Die Hard and Speed. This, coupled with the other achievements of the film, vindicates Dirty Harry's reputation as one of the greatest action thrillers we've seen so far. It may not be able to surpass other classics like The Godfather: Part II or Lawrence of Arabia, but that doesn't detract from its stem-winding cinematic power.",

Harry is disgusted by the bureaucracy and red tape that prevents him from dishing out further justice to those who really deserve it and he resorts to more violent methods when a deranged gunman named Scorpio (Andy Robinson) terrorizes the city. Don Siegel handles the action sequences brilliantly with the suspense enhanced by Lalo Schifrin's spooky score.

Its sort like Al Pacino but more rigid, Pacino had his papers here he got more flexible and showed his skills.Now lets get to if you should watch this movie... A tip for choosing this movie is if you want to watch a police action movie. If you do, then maybe this will fit you. Although this is a police movie, the action scenes are more about showing of power and some suspense than of actual shooting at each other. This is Eastwood style. Like a modern far west movie with eye staring and running around. So if you are like that I do think you should go ahead and try.Now if you are in the mood of manly man fights and epic phrases you can do this too. The characters in this movie are also very strong, though not deep, they show off their acting by having unique personalities and back stories that are told by they actions. Very nice to watch and learn who they are without the director pointing that to you. So, take a time and watch because you will like.And for all the others out there, this maybe isn't that action fast paced movie that you watch on the afternoon to feel like a hero or a soldier so you may not like this.

The 'Scorpio' killer is your standard movie psycho, we never really find out why he's killing people.

Despite being a 'shoot first, ask questions later' cop I can't help but compare Callahan (in this installment, at least) as a tortured soul doing bad things in the name of the law, much in the way that James Ellroy's 'LA confidential' portrays. We don't get a great insight into Harry, that is to come in part 2 'The Enforcer', but as a stand alone movie Harry Callahan has to rate as one of the best screen cops of all time.",

Reni Santoni stands out as Harry's current partner and Andrew Robinson gives a chilling performance as Scorpio, the sniper-killer on the loose in San Francisco. Almost every scene with Robinson is equally funny and frightening (particularly the ransom money drop-off sequence culminating at Golden Gate Park).Effectively shot, directed and scored (by Lalo Schifrin).",

In this day and age of terrible actors being celebrated for making mindless garbage such as Will Smith and that crap he just had out \"hitched\" and anything else he's been in, well its a great relieve to be able to go home, kick back and drop some Dirty Harry in and its very easy to forget that Will and all the other bad actors of today even exist.

The police forces were viewed as helpless, and the movie depicts this view, with Dirty Harry as the hero who fights back against all the evils.

Harry Callahan, played with typical take-no-prisoners panache by Clint Eastwood, isn't here to make friends or to feel good about himself. He exists solely to conduct court on the streets, rulebook be damned; to shoot first and ask questions later. Presumably because the weapon he carries, an iconic, big-barreled Smith & Wesson, doesn't leave enough of its target to raise any objections. \n\nAlthough everyone clearly despises him on a personal level, it's hard to see Harry positioned as anything but the banner-waving antihero: he gets to spout the sweet quotes, wear the cool sunglasses and strike a bunch of badass poses, so his opinions become the film's opinions. That's a problem when the themes grow more ambitious, addressing the shaky ground between what's legal and what's arbitrarily \"right.\" Harry sees everything in stark black-and-white, flying into a seething rage when a high-profile collar walks free due to his own brutish interrogation tactics, and we're meant to cheer when he stalks and eventually forces a second confrontation with the freed criminal. The pursuit itself makes for gripping entertainment - messy, gritty and intense - but the overt political messaging makes it more complicated than a simple yay-rah get-the-bad-guy.\n\nThe film uses its antagonist, the aforementioned sniper, as incendiary proof of the holes in the justice system. If more situations were handled outside the courtroom, I guess, we'd see far fewer hijacked school buses or tortured kids. Odd that the fallacy of this argument is lost on Harry, who's earlier beaten to a bloody pulp by three yokels. Believing what they see, and refusing to wait for the whole story, they jump to conclusions and take him for a peeping Tom. Harry licks his wounds and carries on, blissfully unaware of the poetic irony.\n\nThis isn't just your basic gunsmoke action movie. I might not agree with its conclusions, but I appreciate the debate it inspired within me. It's always good to test one's own beliefs. Also good to soak up a healthy dose of raw '70s atmosphere from time to time, which is something Dirty Harry has in spades.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's San Francisco police detective is the original cop-who-plays-by-his-own-rules. Tasked with hunting down a Zodiac Killer-like of villain, played exceptionally well by a very creepy Andrew Robinson, Eastwood's Harry Callahan ignores the rules in order to get the job done. Rewatching the film, it holds up as a tight piece of storytelling, as you would expect from veteran Hollywood director Don Siegel (\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" \"Riot in Cell Block 11\" \"The Big Steal\" \"Coogan's Bluff\" \"Escape from Alcatraz\"). What's hard for me to know is how this film would be received by someone watching it now for the first time, because \"Dirty Harry\" has been endlessly imitated over the years, having been the originator of innumerable action film tropes (cop as anti-hero, the veteran cop saddled with unwanted college-boy partner, telling his superiors \"you can have my badge,\" big exotic guns, \"What about the rights of that little girl?\", the DA having to release a suspect over illegally obtained evidence, a young cop barfing at the sight of a dead body, not to mention the film's finale, and many, many more), as well as featuring a wildly politically incorrect hero. I'd think that the film would still work for modern audiences in terms of pacing, storytelling, and suspense. Eastwood commands the screen and is supremely charismatic in this iconic role. There are so many classic moments in the film, from the oft quoted bank robbery scene, which was ghost written by the great John Milius (\"Conan the Barbarian\" \"Red Dawn\" \"The Wind and the Lion\"):\n\n\"I know what you're thinking, punk. You're thinking 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Now, to tell you the truth, I forgot myself in all this excitement. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and will blow your head clean off, you've gotta ask yourself a question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?\"\n\nThe scene works even better with Harry's nonchalance to the chaos around him is wonderfully accented by his casually finishing off his hot dog while shooting bank robbers. Later in the film there's the wild scene at the cross when Harry is supposed to give Scorpio a ransom payoff, but ends up stabbing him in the leg, with a crazy cut to Robinson's bizarre and primal scream. There's also the memorable football stadium sequence, where Lalo Schiffrin's excellent score perfectly compliments this shockingly tough sequence. What doesn't age as well is Harry's overt racism and disregard for basic civil rights. It's debatable if a character like Archie Bunker would work today, but the Noble-Bigot-with-a-Badge does not work nearly as well in today's political climate. I considered including a quote from the film as an example, but the racist quips are insidious in how deceitfully charming they come off. In the film's defense, director Siegel has gone on record as saying, \"I was telling the story of a hard-nosed cop and a dangerous killer. What my liberal friends did not grasp was that the cop is almost as evil, in his way, as the sniper.\" Although that may have been true for this picture, it's not as much in the subsequent Dirty Harry films, where he is very much the hero (although the second film had somewhat of a rebuttal to these criticisms by making the villains vigilante cops Harry had to go up against). Also in the film's defense, Eastwood himself made something of a spiritual sequel to the Dirty Harry films with \"Gran Torino,\" in which he played a similar bigoted character, a Korean War veteran who catches his Hmong American neighbor boy trying to steal his car, but subsequently developed a relationship with the boy and his family. Torino could easily have become another powerful white man saves the day type of story, but it's instead more of a meditation on the brand of macho hero (and often racist, sexist, homophobic, etc.) which Eastwood helped to create. Still, \"Dirty Harry\" could never be made today and I think Eli Roth's remake of \"Death Wish\" is evidence of how this type of film just no longer works and in some ways is like trying to bring back minstrel shows. Still, taken as an artifact of its time and in terms on cinematic style and charismatic characters, \"Dirty Harry\" remains an iconic although admittedly politically dubious film.",

The background score is palpable enough to add the cynicism on each sequences, the cinematography is decent with sharp sound effects and fine editing but poor art designing. \n\nThe way it simplifies the human necessities and emotional aspects by choking up the characters' nerves and narrowing its abilities is how it offer a three dimensional perspective to them which is purely cathartic to the eyes. Eastwood is lethal and also vulnerable and with a character range that he has offered he milks out the essential bits and foliates it through finesse on screen. The narration is appreciative and thoroughly gripping but with Siegel's brilliant execution it creates the anticipated impact on screen. \n\nThe smarter ideologies of the crimes are written with maturity and depicts the entire subjective procedure to the viewers to elaborate the bar and the magnitude of the stakes and emotions that the characters are going through it. Thoroughly competent action and chase sequences, gripping and layered screenplay that enfolds with appealing characters and revealing concepts are the high points of the feature. \n\nDirty Harry is undeniably dirty but it is aptly humane and sane whose buoyant natured script is the real gem that keeps giving it back.",

Things just happen and we are allowed to jump on board and learn about the characters as the story moves along. It is easy to connect with the plot because we can quickly hate the killer, and you\u0092ll recognize all the cops based on common stereotypes we know from other movies. I like the interaction of the characters and how straightforward the case is handled. In many ways, if you take out some of Harry\u0092s extreme measures, this felt like the way an actual police investigation might be handled.\n\nI cannot fathom why Clint Eastwood is so charming as Dirty Harry. He has such a gruff and unapproachable demeanor, and he doesn\u0092t talk a whole lot. Yet there\u0092s something about him that makes me care about the character and want to see him succeed. It\u0092s the kind of performance that could seriously turn me off if done by the wrong actor, but Eastwood has what it takes. I also thought Andy Robinson was great as the Scorpio killer. He has such an oily and unpleasant demeanor, so you instantly hate him. The rest of the cops fit their stereotypes, and John Vernon delivers a familiar performance as the Mayor. I was happy with all the acting in the movie.\n\nThe story is one that goes through a number of ups and downs. There were moments when I was extremely locked in and following every step the characters took, and there were other times when I was approaching boredom because I knew they weren\u0092t going to find anything. Perhaps the predictable nature of the plot was what was bugging me in those scenes. It\u0092s not 100% rote, because I didn\u0092t know exactly where each scene was headed, but there were certainly moments that I could predict with ease. The conclusion was ridiculously satisfying, so it kind of covered up for any problems I might have had, and the iconic line (while a bit long) was delivered so well it had the desired impact even though I\u0092ve heard it dozens of times before.",

When the city is threatened by a sniper aka Scorpio Killer (Andrew Robinson) who keeps putting down random victims holds the city police for ransom to stop his rampage. Harry is assigned for the task and they come up with a plan. The sniper gives them a slip after repeated plans lure him to their cage. This time the Scorpio killer takes it personal and asks Harry to deliver the ransom for a final showdown. \n\nFollows a textbook story telling process which later becomes a formula for the genre. A detailed introduction of the antagonist followed by the protagonist only after which the plot surfaces (as wafer thin as it might be) slowly building up to a final showdown. Though the Scorpio killer initially comes off as weak and mad, his character progresses steadily during the course of the story giving multiple dimensions and levels to his character. It is not comprehensible how the police department misses the sniper even multiple sightings with all the man power, pre-planning and technology. But the star is undoubtedly Clint Eastwood who carries the entire weight of the movie and even gives it a considerable boost with an uninterested look on his face, the hype surrounding him because of his volatile trigger happy nature and sharp one-liners. \n\nSimple yet captivating screenplay allows Clint Eastwood to drive the star vehicle",

The film also boasts a soundtrack composed by Lalo Schifrin better known for composing the TV theme for Mission Impossible.\nThe plot concerns a mad man serial killer called Scorpio who terrorises the city with ransom demands and ever more elaborate murders.\nThe city mayor not wanting more bloodbaths seems intent on meeting the killers increasing financial demands whilst Callahan believes he needs stopping using his more direct methods shall we say that fly against the 'left wing' civil liberties of the American constitution.\nEastwood directs some scenes himself in a sign of what direction (pardon the pun) his later film career will take perhaps.\nI was amused with the 1971 environment. For example Scorpio at first demands the 'massive' sum of $100,000!\nThe cars look massive almost as bushy as Eastwoods hairstyle.\nI sometimes wonder if a more right wing method of law enforcement would lower the crime rate (minus blowing people's heads off of course!)\nThat reminds me. The film is best known for one of Callahans phrases that he uses twice in this film.\nThe \"Do you feel lucky, punk\" speech. Actually Callahan is armed with a .44 Magnum firearm. The most powerful hangun in the world at the time.\nIt apparently could blow your head clean off. If faced with its barrel pointing at you, you've got to ask yourself one question surely.

Eastwood would eventually use his stardom to make a successful  bid for  Republican mayor of Carmel, CA.\nWhat makes this movie #3 is the annoying murderer that Harry seeks to bring to justice. I guess Seigel made him so annoying so that the audience would be gratified when Harry shoots him, but he was so annoying I hoped he wasn't even in the movie to begin with.

            "content": "The secret to Dirty Harry's success is in the most famous part of the movies most famous quote. \"Do you feel lucky?\" Typically in cop dramas the good guy and bad guy take turns being in control of the situation and driving the plot forward. In Dirty Harry both the good guy and bad guy are imperfect. Both seem to stumble through the conflict. The sniper stumbles through the action scenes, while Harry stumbles because of his responsibilities as a police officer. \n\nThe film begins in typical fashion with a sniper on a roof. His second attempt he gets spotted by a helicopter. That's when we know we're not in for a connect-the-dots kind of cop drama. The crime spree ends before it begins, and the rest of the movie is about what other action movies would sum up in the last 10 minutes. The villain is shamelessly wicked and very unusual. At times it has the atmosphere and musical score of a sleazy early 80's slasher movie. \n\nHarry is imperfect because he's an old school kind of cop with old school methods and he has a dark sense of humor that comes off as politically incorrect to people who don't him. Catching the criminal isn't the problem. The problem is bringing him to justice within the limitations of the law. Harry allows the black man at the beginning to be \"lucky\" because Harry knows the justice system will take care of him, but with the sniper justice isn't guaranteed. The word \"lucky\" is so significant because through the whole movie that's what the sniper used as a weapon. Luck saved him from harry each time. Luck got him off the hook because of a technicality. But ultimately, the snipers luck had no power over Dirty Harry Callahan.",

            "content": "\"You know, you're crazy if you think you've heard the last of this guy. He's gonna kill again,\" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) sighs to his superior.  A maniac (a fantastic Andrew Robinson) is on the loose, killing anybody who comes to his liking, usually on the edges of rooftops with a polished sniper rifle.  His wild, long blond hair blows in the wind with the prowess of a lion ready for an attack, his deranged face snarling with noxious elation.  He is the Scorpio, a murderer who finds himself amused when blood spills onto his hands.  Callahan has done everything to stop him, yet he has escaped the grip of authority with aggravating repetition.\n\tUnfortunately for the so-called Scorpio, Callahan is no Frank Bullitt and is definitely not a Jacques Clouseau-type.  Carrying a .44 magnum, which he dubs \"the most powerful gun in the world,\" Callahan is unflinchingly acerbic, humorless, and unafraid to sidestep the law and take justice into his own hands.\n\tWhen \"Dirty Harry\" was released in 1971, it was a new kind of cop movie.  It was one with an outrageous amount of violence and one with a lack of a moral compass.  Simply put, it was a source of serious controversy.  Police brutality was something left untouched by most American films, and to have a hero slightly deranged himself was something far and away from the well-defined good guy/bad guy clich\u00e9.  But to take \"Dirty Harry\" seriously would be like viewing a comic book with a realistic lens; it's a piece of seedy pulp that takes the police thriller genre and stretches it out with operatic carnage and dark alley sleaziness.  \n\tThe streets of San Francisco are like the frames of a graphic novel, colored with dim electric light by night and saturated with disconcerting warmth by day.  The film lives in a world where crime runs around with menace, becoming nearly casual to its citizens.  Harry Callahan is like Batman, minus the suit, Batmobile, immortal sidekick, and underground lair.  \nHe is most well-defined in an early scene where he sits down in a diner for a midday snack.  That moment of peace, though, is interrupted when he notices a bank robbery in progress across the street.  A few of the criminals have been gunned down, but one lies on the steps of the entrance, bleeding and moaning.  Rather than arrest him, Callahan is inspired to taunt him, make him transform from predator to prey in a matter of seconds.  He deadpans his way through a mini-speech that seems prewritten as he cocks his gun: \"I know what you're thinking. 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world.  It would blow you head clean off.  You've gotta ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?'\" We discover that the thief is lucky - Callahan has fired all six shots.\nBut it becomes clear later on that he most likely already knew that all six shots were fired.  When it comes to a dirty criminal, however, why not play a sick game of Russian Roulette?  Callahan would prefer to teach brutal lessons and give bad guys a taste of their own medicine; Miranda rights and the amendments are for sissies.\nHarry Callahan was the original tough-guy detective, remaining to be a brute force of fortitude and pointed courage.  Without Eastwood, he wouldn't have that ominous edge by his side.  It's a performance of precise emotion.  He delivers every line with a diverting softly spoken voice, only to later explode with an awesome capability for violence.  As he whispers his few words, we can only wonder what's going on in his head.  Callahan is such a legendary figure in cinema because every move he makes is recognizable, embedded into the foreboding underbellies of neo-noir.  \"Dirty Harry\" is iconic for a reason: few cop movies have been able to thrill without the slight glitter of Hollywood lure.  It can be sickeningly violent, but that's only because one foot is glued on action and the other is on realism.",

Harry Callahan has so many great catchphrases engrained in our societies consciousness that will be quoted long into the future. Every guy wants to be as cool as Eastwood in Dirty Harry. The man is the definition of a true badass, and the larger than life persona is captured on screen. The Dirty Harry franchise is one of the most iconic of the last century, and this is the picture that started it all.",

The backlash against the counterculture, the preoccupation with supposed sexual deviance, the fine-tuned racism, the belief that the government is too soft on crime, the certainty that the only real justice is that which is dispensed through the barrel of a gun: it's all here, in almost the exact form that it still exists on AM talk radio, in misspelled Facebook posts, and in the jeremiads of right-wing politicians.  But while the ideology of the \"Dirty Harry\" universe is an unintentional charicature, the movie is undoubtedly well-made and well-acted.  Andrew G. Robinson is playing society's stereotype of a serial killer, but he's doing it marvelously.  Clint Eastwood isn't working outside his comfort zone, but like John Wayne or Arnold Schwarzenegger, he doesn't need to.  \"Dirty Harry\" follows in the footsteps of hard-boiled detective movies of Hollywood's yesteryear, and points the way to future buddy-cop potboilers.  Although it launched a mini-franchise, the original is in many ways its own sequel, with clearly defined acts that allow for a substantial amount of call-backs and self-references within a relatively short runtime.",

Unfortunately, Scorpio, to me, didn't live up to the expectations of the ideal villain, and I didn't consider him a formidable opponent to Eastwood's character. However, like I said before, the real meat of the movie is the struggle between Harry Callahan and the law.

From the first few minutes, it's not hard to tell that this would be an instant classic. Clint Eastwood's performance here as Harry Callahan, an inspector, is just as cool as his the Man With No Name role in the Dollars trilogy, and Clint Eastwood is the epitome of cool. He's a reason to see this movie alone, but of course, there's tons of other stuff that make this such a great movie. \n\nThe story is about an inspector named Harry Callahan who's assigned to hunt down a psycho serial killer named Scorpio. Everything is so well handled, and takes a simple idea and expands on it with an incredible amount of tension, as well as great acting, especially by Clint Eastwood who made himself and his role an icon, and by Andy Robinson as Scorpio who completely nails the role as a madman serial killer. Don Siegel offers a dark and brutal view of crime in San Francisco, with an intimidating and frightening Scorpio. It's tightly paced with tons of memorable scenes and lines, and even some fairly messed up stuff as well.\n\n It was even considered controversial due to its \"fascist\" message that many viewers interpreted the movie to convey. I can see why some people wouldn't appreciate this film because of the message, which in a way defies the law and builds on the fact about how Harry takes matters into his own hands. I, however, was not bothered by its message. The magnum speech by Harry is awesome and never gets old, and the influence this movie had on the thriller genre of movies was huge, spawning not only four more movies in the \"Dirty Harry\" series, but modern thrillers can be traced back to this movie. It's a classic in every way, and not only remains one of the defining films of the 70s, but its influence is clear in modern day movies as well.",

            "content": "This is the iconic Dirty Harry?  The movie is a blatant, unsophisticated polemic that positions one-dimensional characters (better said, cariacatures) on collusion course against the backdrop of a wildly improbable and contrived plot; sanctimonious police brutality is exonerated by the brusque dismissal of inconvenient civil liberties.  Famous lines are are hurried and delivered with none of the stylized gusto with which they are frequently quoted.\n\nDevelopment of the Scorpio's motive is so completely evaded that it can only be purposeful.  His character is a hodge-podge, a composite of American discontents, exhibiting alternating flashes of racial hatred, misogyny and militant atheism.  He even manages to pair an outsized sense of entitlement regarding government services owed to him with an extreme, paranoid distrust of that same government.  He's an all-purpose, wild-eyed malcontent; a bad egg who faults society for his shortcomings.  \n\nSure, some empathy-obcessed liberals with PhDs are likely enough to countenance this view, retroactively indulging his crimes with hamfisted motives.  But any level-headed person knows the real problem is his failure to take responsibility for himself. \n\nWriting the whole thing off as a poorly conceived vehicle for delivering the apologist case for strong-armed, objectivist authoritarianism to the movie-going public is tempting, but that risks implying more clarity of purpose than warranted.  The viewer, it seems clear, is faced with ploddingly stupid DE-lusion, as opposed to intentional manipulation characteristic of closely related and potentially malicious, IL-lusion.  Such treatment would also ignore the stubborn resonance Inspector Callahan continues to enjoy. \n\nContext is important, one polemic follows another and the pendulum has a well-known penchant for hyberbole.  Viewed as a backlash reaction against the movement to extend civic liberties to vast, disenfrancised segments of the population, which had come to dominate the public discourse over the previous decade, Dirty Harry no longer seems quite as out-of-step with reality.  Fitting then, that a clean-cut, well-dressed (for the 70s, I can only infer) principled cop should be the only thing standing between San Francisco, the capital of all things hippie, and self-suffication by the hands of destructive, over-tolerance.  It seems that Hollywood was as in tune with the demands of 'silent majority' social conservatives as Richard Nixon.  \n\nWith this in mind, the viewer is compelled to revisit a recurring theme (simultaneously the movie's sole brush with cleverness): repeated questions to the origins of Harry's \"Dirty\" sobriquet.  Though multiple explanations are mooted by various events and characters, including Callahan's own musings, the real explanation would be easier missed if fired from a .44 magnum.\n\nHarry isn't dirty.  In fact, he's a model policeman.  He has an unshakeable moral compass and, most importantly, repeatedly demonstrates that the duty to protect is one and the same with his identity.  One might be forgiven for confusing the official police officer oath as Inspector Callahan's personal profile.\n\nWhat makes him dirty is moral erosion masquerading as progress.  He's a stalwart bastion of 1950's values trapped amidst the stagnant destitution of the 1970s, owing to the self-indulgent and ideological snafu inscribed on the interceding period.  The two-fold pinch of escalating violence-- the kind that requires carrying a .44 magnum  as a sidearm-- and the encroachment of legal constraints conspire to tie his hands, constraining the good inspector's ability to perform his duties.  By the climax, his room for manuever is so diminished that he actually must break the law to carry out his protective duties effectively.  In this contorted maze of contradictory incentives, turning in his badge is the only morally upstanding course of action that remains open to him. \n\nMaybe Galt's Gulch, Ayn Rand's unfortunately-named objectivist utopia in Atlas Shrugged, that libertarian bible, to which the world's precious few productive members withdraw in an epic outpouring of sullen poutiness, is looking for a sheriff.\n\nOn the other hand, the movie clearly had a profound influence on the Diehard trilogy (only the first three deserve acknowledgement as serious films), so it's not all sobs and rough-hewn, man-crush throbs for put-upon feeling white males.",

When the city is threatened by a sniper aka Scorpio Killer (Andrew Robinson) who keeps putting down random victims holds the city police for ransom to stop his rampage. Harry is assigned for the task and they come up with a plan. The sniper gives them a slip after repeated plans lure him to their cage. This time the Scorpio killer takes it personal and asks Harry to deliver the ransom for a final showdown.\r\n\r\nFollows a textbook story telling process which later becomes a formula for the genre. A detailed introduction of the antagonist followed by the protagonist only after which the plot surfaces (as wafer thin as it might be) slowly building up to a final showdown. Though the Scorpio killer initially comes off as weak and mad, his character progresses steadily during the course of the story giving multiple dimensions and levels to his character. It is not comprehensible how the police department misses the sniper even multiple sightings with all the man power, pre-planning and technology. But the star is undoubtedly Clint Eastwood who carries the entire weight of the movie and even gives it a considerable boost with an uninterested look on his face, the hype surrounding him because of his volatile trigger happy nature and sharp one-liners. \r\n\r\nSimple yet captivating screenplay allows Clint Eastwood to drive the star vehicle",

By focusing on the film's moral position, I think the critics of their time forgot that films are as much art as they are entertainment, and this film excels both on the level of art and entertainment. The film portrays a detective trying to apprehend a vicious psychopath, while grappling with the orders of his superiors contradicting his own moral instincts. To Dirty Harry, the criminal is as clear as day, but what enrages him is that law is too slow to act. He represents society's latent desire for swift and effective justice without any interference from a middle man. In the dazed and confused time that was the early 1970's, he was essentially a kind of modern cowboy, the ultimate antithesis of what John Wayne came to represent. We can his politics all we want, but he certainly gets the job done, and I actually admire him as a character because of it. In the film, Clint Eastwood delivers what is perhaps the kind of tense performance and implicitly tough persona that distinguishes him as a great actor. The film also manages to realize its seedy setting effortlessly, the end result being a visual representation of what was then the present. Of course, nothing steals the spotlight quite like the raw violence that speaks louder than the film's eponymous protagonist, and it can't be denied that it's always a pleasure to see Clint Eastwood do what he does best. Whether you loved it for its uncompromising attitude, or hated it for its supposed politics, this film will always leave an impression on you in some way or another, and it will most likely be among the most truly raw of cinematic experiences.",

Well, do ya, punk!?\"\n\nWho in Earth hasn't heard these words. That was the line that led me to many Clint Eastwood's classics, from the times he didn't contribute intellectually to his creations but rather showed off as a competent American action \"hero\" the massess could identify with. First with Sergio Leone's masterful trilogy of \"The Man With No Name\", where a rather amazing amount of substance is complemented by the brilliant Lee Van Kleef, and more recently on what is arguably his most known work: a fascist cop that goes by the nickname of \"Dirty Harry\". \n\nThe problem of this film is structuraly its simplicity. I could not believe any single thing any of the characters were saying, almost as if the actors were being forced into a ridiculous plotline with absolutely no free will. That's the problem of the right-wing and its fantasies: it doesn't succeed on understanding society or the world, for that matter, in any important terms rather than its own terms, which usually make things puerile. \n\nI frankly don't understand what makes Clint Eastwood's icon a hero... he states obvious nationalism... he could even wear a Nazi uniform and go on unnoticed. In one scene he expressess his etnics concerns to a Mexican cop, argumenting that \"not trusting foreigners\" was one of his virtues. What is that supposed to mean? Is that truly a hero? In an era so overwhelmed by the Cold War and the idiotic massess seeking safety in undermined concepts, there are certain films from the time that captured mankind's hypocresy on a spectacular way. There you have \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"A Clockwork Orange\", two masterpieces of American filmmaking. But remember who were those characters and what they did. Peter Sellers played a series of bizarre and insane personas, product of monumental events that shaped the world through the 20th Century. Then was Alex DeLarge, a psycopathic criminal who as a victim of totalitarianism was forced to become a sin machine meant for practical purposes. But then, who is Dirty Harry exactly? An intolerant 19th Century fetishist whose greater skill lies in the use of a Magnum gun and complete disregarding for human life? How is that supposed to be a hero, anyway? Is that the person who is going to protect the identity of the State, rather than destroy it? \n\nThe film even mocks classical laws principles, in favor of vigilantism and illegitimate killing as a form of justice. So, after all, we realize that the great \"American hero\" is only that idiotizing product whose only reliable force is the use of a bigger gun. No wonder there are people like James Holmes in the streets!",

The acting is solid from all, with Clint Eastwood delivering some of the most memorable lines in cinema history.

A lot of the film's appeal -- less noticeable to the 21st century's young viewers, but still there -- also came from a political message that 1960s social liberalism had gone too far, leaving society vulnerable to creeps and savages whom cops were literally unable to touch without warrants and red tape. \n\nHarry, a hero cop, meanwhile, becomes an outlaw just for trying to do his job.

            "content": "Review Number: 1\r\n\r\nDirty Harry - The classic that spawned off a whole generation of similar-type movies, but always remained in a league of its own. \r\n\r\nDon Siegel's \"Dirty Harry\" was arguably the start of the serial killer/cop genre inherent in so many mainstream American movies released today. Setting the stage for countless rip-offs and sequels, \"Dirty Harry\" was one of the true first of its kind--not only in regards to its genre influence but also in terms of its content. (Full frontal nudity, heavy vigilante-style violence and strong language.) It is, in fact, one of the quintessential 1970s films--capturing the very essence of the typical gritty '70s film style we're all familiar with. \r\n\r\nIt is an excellent police thriller about a serial killer who can only be brought to book by a police officer who is prepared to bend the rules a little. As well as being an exciting and suspenseful story in itself, there is an interesting - and unresolved - subtext about whether the end justifies the means (the film, long before any sequels were envisioned, ends with Harry's vigilante-style policing administering the roughest of justice to killer Scorpio, but then throwing his police shield away in disgust at how impotent due process leaves authority against such people). \r\n\r\nHarry is a paradox. In one sense, he is an 'outlaw'. He has little respect for formal authority (in the opening minutes, we see him being rude to the mayor) and he carries a strictly non-regulation monster of a gun. Harry is openly racist and mutinous. And yet he is also deeply moral. He conforms to an unarticulated ethical code that is anglosaxon American. He protects the weak and confronts the wrongdoers, no matter how the odds are stacked against him. Arguably, it was this characterisation that made Eastwood a megastar.\r\n\r\nThere are some illogicalities about the plot. Such an important event as the cash drop is left to two cops working alone, when in reality there would be a massive covert operation. When Scorpio beats the rap, there is no public outcry or media storm, and he is allowed to get on with his anonymous existence virtually untroubled.\r\n\r\nAt the time of its release, \"Dirty Harry\" was seen to be very much in touch with the mood of the general public who had seen an obvious increase in violent crime accompanied by an apparent inability on the part of the law enforcement agencies to deal with the problem effectively. This left many people feeling vulnerable and let down by the system that was supposed to be there to protect them. The analysis of the problem as expounded by Harry Callahan was that the justice system had become too soft on criminals, criminals' rights had been given greater importance than those of the victims and the lawyers who represented suspected criminals were simply hell bent on obstructing the police in their work.\r\n\r\nDirty Harry is a classic of in every way, shape, form, and one of the most influential works in the genre. Great action magnificently directed by Don Siegel, the master of the genre, great dialogue, and relentless tension make this the ultimate detective thriller and one of the defining films of the 1970s.",

The feature may be of \"cat and mouse\" nature but its simple chess politics that it plays with all tricks in, is what makes it smarter and cunning than the usual cop cases. If it is brimmed with action then it is full of slick moves, if it has any chase or physical sequences it is performed with panache and if there are any morale conflicts or threats they are projected with gut wrenching execution that screams the glorifying cinematic experience that every fan aspires for. The background score is palpable enough to add the cynicism on each sequences, the cinematography is decent with sharp sound effects and fine editing but poor art designing. The way it simplifies the human necessities and emotional aspects by choking up the characters' nerves and narrowing its abilities is how it offer a three dimensional perspective to them which is purely cathartic to the eyes. Eastwood is lethal and also vulnerable and with a character range that he has offered he milks out the essential bits and foliates it through finesse on screen. The narration is appreciative and thoroughly gripping but with Siegel's brilliant execution it creates the anticipated impact on screen. The smarter ideologies of the crimes are written with maturity and depicts the entire subjective procedure to the viewers to elaborate the bar and the magnitude of the stakes and emotions that the characters are going through it. Thoroughly competent action and chase sequences, gripping and layered screenplay that enfolds with appealing characters and revealing concepts are the high points of the feature. Dirty Harry is undeniably dirty but it is aptly humane and sane whose buoyant natured script is the real gem that keeps giving it back.",

The debut of the iconic character from Clint Eastwood, but even better, I loved the plot and feeling of the film as it was pretty much about the \"Zodiac\" Killer, and was made while that case was still fresh in the public consciousness a few years after it happened.  It felt much like another film I liked, \"Zodiac\" and is almost a companion piece to that, as that one is more investigative, and this one is more atmospheric, has more action, and of course the 70's milieu.  So if you like action films, you will probably like it, and if you like thrillers, mysteries, and similar genres, you would probably like it as well.  And the character Clint Eastwood creates is always interesting on screen.  Surprisingly it was way better than I thought it would be, and ends up as one of my favorite movies from the 70's.",

Everything about Dirty Harry is wonderful. The cinematography is fine and the locations and scenery are quite striking. Lalo Schifrin's music sets the atmosphere very well too, while the story is taut, the script is quotable and cleverly written, Don Siegel's direction is superb and the violence is shocking and daring. The acting is also great, in his more complex roles Clint Eastwood was born for the role of Dirty Harry, and all the supporting roles are very well played. All in all, brilliant and one of the crime thrillers there is. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I believe it was made with the concept of police breaking the law in order to prioritize the rights of the victims over the criminals.  An original idea at the time, interesting to think it began somewhere.  Bullitt did much of this as well, and better but not as bombastic as this, thanks to the writing of John Milius.  This was a pioneer of killing a criminal before he commits the crime.  They laugh about beating prisoners, this was a time we trusted police and didn't need 75 cops tv shows to do it.  He jokes about all the races he hates.  Creeps on women in their homes. He beats and insults a guy threatening suicide. He shoots first.  He uses illegal weapons. He breaks into homes.  He doesn't get search warrants.  He shoots unarmed people.  He doesn't read rights or allow legal counsel before questioning.  He tortures criminals.  He stalks people in off hours.  He causes car wrecks, involving kids, nearly shoots kids.  The scorpio killer is a good character, like the Joker but 40 years ahead.  The best scene is the scorpio killer paying a black guy to beat him up.  The scene with him slapping kids for not wanting to go to the ice cream factory is hilarious, it's very dysfunctional family.",

They gave us some of the best action films. Can we get some similar stuff today? ..The character of Dirty Harry is great and it has the best characterization of Harry among all five films. Some early dialogues and scenes give a very clear introduction to the iconic character portrayed by the great Clint Eastwood. His lines are just awesome. And the way he delivers them is fantastic. Not just this, his characterization is very firm and strong. We can fully get behind his way of working and going against the law to do something right. One more thing, Harry is a badass character, and is full of testosterone. But he isn't a super-powerful and literally invulnerable guy. As a matter of fact, he feels humane and believable. He has weaknesses and the clear belief that his methods are good. The villain in this movie is also good. He gives a very good support to the character of Harry Callahan, being a sadistic and crazy a$$hole at the same time. He gets under our nerves very quickly. The actor has done a fine job in (perhaps) his only film role. Speaking of the story, it's not about who did it sort of a mystery thriller, but rather a \"chase\". It's all about how Harry gets \"unstable\" little by little because of the doings of Scorpio. It gets more and more serious as it proceeds. The final showdown between Harry and Scorpio is worth the build up of the story. The conclusion is really satisfying. There are entertaining action scenes. There are disturbing and dark moments. Eastwood gives some badass moments and quotable lines. And the way Eastwood delivers the the same quote in the first act and in the third act is quite great. There are also a lot of scenes where he messes up with authorities and even says \"the law is crazy\". None of them feel forced or so. In short it is a representative of a great 70s Hollywood crime action film. Nothing holds the film down. ..Conclusion : One of the best 70s Hollywood movie. It has all the excitement that an action film needs and all the right elements of a cop drama/crime movie. It will not disappoint at any level whatsoever. Completely recommended for old film lovers and to the genre fans. ..Rating. ..Score : absolute 10/10Grade : golden A+",

Dirty Harry is the original and best in the series, Dirty Harry spawned sequels but none of them could maintain the high standards of the violent and gripping original, filled with tension and tense moments and classic quotes and lines... A killer named Scorpio (Andrew Robinson) is a rooftop killer because he's snipering people from roofs but at times keeps a low profile but eventually runs out of luck, he results in taking a school bus of kids hostage and demanding money or certain people die. Inspector Callahan also known as Dirty Harry (Clint Eastwood) chases the killer on a few occasions, follows him and tries to stop him at each turn but the killer is always a step ahead usually until the end. Full of violence and bad language and an excellent performance by Eastwood I'd say Dirty Harry is a classic crime thriller and one of the best movies ever made.  It may have scenes of nudity so kids should avoid it and Eastwood carries his signature 44 magnum on him so we can all spot him casually walking around the streets blowing the badguys away after chomping on a hotdog.... It's fairly dark in places and always entertaining even when the action scenes aren't operational because the storyline is so good. Excellent film and a must watch in my opinion, also stars John Vernon as the mayor and Reni Santoni.",
