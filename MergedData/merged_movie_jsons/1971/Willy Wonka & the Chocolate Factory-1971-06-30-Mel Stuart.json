            "content": "The world goes on chocolate overdrive when it's announced that famed candy maker, Willy Wonka, has put five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars. The lucky recipients of these tickets will be treated to a day out in the top secret Wonka factory, where they can see how the sweets are made, and if they are even luckier, they will get a lifetimes supply of free chocolate. Nobody wants a golden ticket more than Charlie Bucket, from a desperately poor family, Charlie has learned to accept his heritage with a grace and credibility not befitting most other children. So when a miracle upon miracles happens, and Charlie finds a golden ticket, it just may prove to be a turning point far beyond his wildest dreams.They say that true love lasts a lifetime, so shall it be the case with Willy Wonka and myself. As a child I was captivated by the colours, the dream of myself being able to visit a magical place where sweets and chocolate roll off the production line purely for my ingestion. Songs that I memorised back in my youth have never left me, and now as a considerably middle aged adult male, I can still embrace, and feel the magic, whilst enjoying the darkly knowing aspects of this fabulous and wondrous black comedy.Roald Dahl was quite a writer of note, and thankfully the makers here have brought his astute morality tale to vivid cinematic life. Director Mel Stuart, aided by his screenwriter David Seltzer, even manage to add to Dahl's wonderful story courtesy of a sinister outsider, who apparently in the guise of a rival corporation, will pay handsomely for a Wonka top secret, morality, greed and power all coming together in one big chocolate explosion. The greatest gift that Willy Wonka gives, tho, is that of the set designs and art direction, where in an almost hypnotically drug induced colourful world, Wonka's factory is a child's dream come true, however, peril is at every turn as life's lessons dolled out courtesy of the scarily cute Oompa Loompas.Songs are provided by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricuse, with the sumptuous art coming from Harper Goff. Gene Wilder takes the lead role of Willy Wonka, magnetic and bordering on clued in madness, Wilder takes his rightful place in the pantheon of memorable performances performed in fantasy pictures. But ultimately it's the story and the way it appeals to every age group that makes Willy Wonka a prize treasure, the kids love it, while the adults watching with them will be wryly nodding and trying to suppress the onset of a devilish grin.Pure magic is Willy Wonka, see it now in High Definition TV to fully realise the dream/nightmare on offer, oh oh I love it so. 10/10",

            "content": "Surprisingly, Roald Dahl (author of Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, on which this film is based) reportedly hated this big screen version of his book. There's no denying that the book is sheer genius, but in all honesty this film adaptation is exceptionally well made too. In fact, it comes high up on my list of all-time movie favourites.The Wonka Chocolate Factory is an amazing building from which some of the most scrumdiddlyumptious sweets are delivered to the world's candy stores. Wonka-mania hits the world when five golden tickets are hidden inside packs of Wonka bars - for the winners will be granted a tour of the top-secret factory. Young Charlie Bucket, a poor boy whose family cottage lies within sight of Wonka's factory, dreams of becoming a winner - but with barely a penny to his name, does he have a chance?What makes Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory such a success is the way it skillfully blends entertainment and a serious underlying moral. Each winning child is exposed as being rotten-to-the-core, then dealt with harshly and dismissively by Wonka. Seeing these awful brats get their come-uppance is hilarious, enjoyable and - on a serious level - quite eye-opening (it's as if parents in the audience are being told how to prevent their children from turning bad). Gene Wilder was simply born to play Wonka (every eccentric phrase, every bemused expression, and every mischievous glance is judged to perfection). The film's set design is fabulous, with particular high-spots including the chocolate room, the egg room and the wacky corridor which gets smaller and narrower the closer you get to the end. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is simply magic - a film that everyone must see, especially parents whose kids are just becoming that bit too big for their boots!",

            "content": "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a truly magnificent piece of filmmaking and remains one of the most fascinating and wonderful adventure films ever made. One of the things that makes this film so intriguing is that it could have been made at any time. I mean, just from watching it, you can't really tell when it was made. It has been one of my favorite films for almost 20 years now, and it wasn't until today that I actually realized when it was made. Watching it again last night, I had convinced myself that it was made sometime in the early to mid 80s, and I was shocked to find out that this year is the movie's 30 year anniversary. Until now, pretty much the only movie I associate with 1971 is A Clockwork Orange, and it's just strange for some reason to find out that this classic movie was made so long ago.At any rate, Willy Wonka is a tremendously imaginative and inspiring film. It's a family film, but one of the most important aspects of a family film is that it has to be enjoyable for a variety of ages. This is what makes movies like Toy Story and Shrek such huge successes- the adults will love it just as much as the kids are sure to. Hence: `family' film. On the other hand, this is also the downfall of such other movies that are strictly for a much younger audience, like Cats & Dogs. The makers of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory understood this very well, and you can see that just by the way that the cast is divided. Here are all of these kids (funny how it was only kids who found those golden tickets\u0085) who were at this candy factory, and they had each elected to bring one of their parents with them as the one admissible member of their family who was allowed by Wonka to accompany them to the factory. One of the best elements of this film is the excellently written script and, even more, the songs. These are some of the best songs in any movie ever made, rivaling even the best of the songs from Disney's films (hey, some of them are really good\u0085). There are, of course, some exceptions, such as `Cheer up, Charlie,' which I have been fast-forwarding through for as long as I can remember, but for the most part, the songs are fun to listen to and they pertain to life outside the movie. They are not just songs about the candy-making genius of Willy Wonka or the excitement of being able to tour his mysterious factory, but they are about life in the real world. They're about believing in yourself and being motivated in life (`Anything you want to, do it. Want to change the world, there's nothing to it\u0085'), but there are also some that have to do mostly with the movie but are still just as enjoyable, such as the classic song that Wonka sings in the tunnel on board his boat (curiously named `Wonkatania'), which was creepily covered by Marilyn Manson a couple of decades later. The dialogue in the film contains some of the most interesting little tidbits in the entire movie. Wonka's lines, in particular, are wonderfully strange and amusing (`A little nonsense now and then is cherished by the wisest men.'). He is a truly eccentric and fascinating man, and Gene Wilder captures the character flawlessly, as he delivers the lines from the brilliantly written script. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of those rare movies that comes along and completely changes the way that fantasy films are made. It's all about having fun in life and being hopeful against all odds and, most of all, being able to have fun in life. There are times when you have to let things go for a while and just act like a kid. Eat candy, run around and play, steal fizzy lifting drinks and bump into the ceiling that now has to be washed and sterilized, it doesn't matter as long as no one's looking. That's such a trivial little quirk of Wonka's (who sterilizes their ceiling?) that it becomes obvious that the movie is trying to say that it's okay to break the rules every once in a while. Have fun in life. Besides being absolutely mouth-watering (to this day, I still fantasize about sinking my teeth into one of those gigantic gummy bears), the movie is an uplifting adventure that warms the heart and sends people of all ages away with fairy tale candies dancing in their heads and wonderful songs just behind their lips. It is an always-welcome vacation from reality for people of all ages, and it should always be remembered and loved for that. This movie will ALWAYS be a must-see.",

This is without a doubt one of the most charming movies of all time that is still to this day one of the most enjoyed movies for a family night. Despite it's dark little messages, it still made light of everything and made this movie \"satisfying and delicious\".You'll see a world of pure imagination and will absolutely fall for Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder is a comedic genius who will forever be the timeless Willy Wonka. He played it so well and made it look so easy. All the kids were amazing as well, I mean the boy who played Charlie was so adorable and you felt so awful for him. You just wished for his deepest wishes to come true. The sets are also just fantastic and so yummy to look at. On of my favorite scenes was with the \"inventing room\", all the amazing gizzmo's. I also loved how we took a peek into Wonka's madness when he throws a shoe into a boiling water pot and says \"It gives it a little kick\". One of my favorite lines of all time is \"Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker\".The film is not only great to look at but it has terrific and catchy songs that will be stuck in your head and find yourself humming down the street. This is going to be a timeless classic that I can't wait to show my future children.10/10",

            "content": "This is a hugely enjoyable film, based upon the book by Roald Dahl. The film does have a number of merits, especially the flawless performance of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, a characterisation that is charming and funny at the same time. Another standout is Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, his scenes with Charlie were lovingly realised, but in his song, he was just hilarious, and his singing voice was remarkably good. However, whereas Peter Ostrum is perfectly agreeable in terms of acting as Charlie, he is let down by his lack of any real singing ability. Though the film does look beautiful with excellent cinematography and colourful sets, and the supporting characters like the Oompa Loompas, the odiously spoilt Veruca Salt, television addict Mike Tevee and the rather disgusting Violet Bueragarde, are very well done, and the actors are further advantaged by a wonderful sparkling script. The songs are lovely, especially Oompa Loompa, Imagination and I want it Now, though I will say I felt Cheer Up Charlie was rather tedious and slowed the film down quite considerably. Overall, a beautiful film, and I do think it is underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

            "content": "It's Gene Wilder, at the top of his form, who made this unique imaginative adventure more vibrant and gleeful. His energetic performance is by no means different from Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins. He absolutely deserved ,at least, an Oscar nomination. The movie lost some of its sharpness and suffered from some monotony after some time from reaching the factory. But besides the gorgeous production design and cool visuals, there was Wilder's charisma that helped to elevate the movie. The first half of the movie has great emotional value, and established the characters very well. Also, it feature some of the most beautiful songs of the movie. But due to the fast pacing, there was an action in the first half that felt forced, if it was necessary to serve a turning point of the story.There are many powerful and very important messages in the movie. But the greatest thing about them is not actually the messages themselves, as we witnessed them delivered in a lot of movies before, but it's how genuine these messages seem as they are delivered in this particular story. Peter Ostrum is great in his first and ,unfortunately, his last role. There are many dramatic scenes that required a very good actor and he is. Actually, I didn't feel for even a moment that this is his acting debut. Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is a total blast from start to finish.\nIt's Scrumdiddlyumptious! (8.5/10)",

            "content": "When I first saw this movie on VHS in the late '80s, I was shocked. A '70s movie with a GOOD message?? I couldn't believe it. The message: kids - be honest and be trustworthy and don't be obnoxious; parents - don't spoil your kids or they'll quickly turn out to be brats.Wow, no wonder liberal critics like Leonard Maltin trashed this film. It was not the normal message being delivered in movies, which usually trashes the good and glorifies the bad. That's what makes this story refreshing, and the same goes for the re-make that was released in 2005.Peter Ostrum plays the likable Charlie and is very good. He's one of the nicest kids ever put on screen and was a fine actor. It's kind of surprising this was the only film he ever did! Jack Albertson does a nice job of Charlie's loving grandpa and so do the bratty kids, especially the English girl who is so bad you have to laugh at her.The first part of the story was a good satire on how people sometimes make trivial things so important and how the news media gets carried way with stupid issues. (Wow, look at it now!) The second half of the story is intriguing because of the co-star of the film: Willy Wonka - a no-nonsense candy maker who doesn't put up with the brats - was fascinating to watch. (The critics thought he was too nasty.) Gene Wilder is excellent as Willy. Yes, he has a bit of a mean streak to him but his comments are fun to hear and on the money despite his lack of verbal tact. Most people prefer Wilder's version of \"Wonka,\" by the way, over the bizarre-but- talented Johnny Depp's.This was an entertaining film that should keep your interest. It's also an interesting comparison to the 2005 movie. Frankly, I enjoyed both.",

I liked it well enough back then, but it's only now that I'm older that I can appreciate the true sinister glory of this movie. It's so deliciously creepy! For those who have to whine about how messed up it is, consider the original \"Cinderella.\" Now that was awful. Willy Wonka is the stranger with a bag of chocolate that parents are always warning their kids about, but what he's really offering is a seductive nightmare in a kaleidescope of candy colors, a cautionary tale told with fairy story whimsy. I got it when I was 5, but the thrill didn't register. \"A dirty trick on innocent children?\" Some people out there obviously don't remember what it's really like to be a kid. Childhood is full of booby traps and the allure of the forbidden, and that which is evil frequently looks divine. \"Willy Wonka\" is about giving in and seeing the horrors and delights, the choices and pratfalls  on the other side. It's disturbing because it strikes a certain primal chord: freedom and danger are entwined, and people have never wanted to associate children with either.",

            "content": "Five children from different walks of life win golden tickets that enable them to partake on a tour of an elaborate candy factory run by eccentric recluse Willy Wonka (superbly played to the creepy and quirky hilt by Gene Wilder). Director Mel Stuart and screenwriter Roald Dahl use the deceptively pleasant premise as a means to turn the concept of the breezy and innocuous escapist fantasy musical that's fun for the entire family completely on its ear by presenting four hideously obnoxious kids -- Julie Dawn Cole's petulant and pampered rich bitch Veruca Salt, Michael Bollner's gluttonous Augustus Gloop, Denise Nickerson's rude gow-chewing Violet Beauregarde, and Paris Themmen's addled boob tube addict Mike Teevee -- who are terrible toxic products of too lenient and/or indulgent parents and hence wholly deserving of the harsh fates that befall them. Mostly importantly, while protagonist Charlie Bucket (a fine and likeable performance by Peter Ostrom) is a basically decent and honest boy, he isn't bereft of a few flaws himself. Director Stuart deftly crafts a light, yet dark and sardonic tone as well as keeps the immensely entertaining story moving along at a brisk pace. Dahl's clever script not only provides lots of sparkling witty lines and sharply drawn characters, but also offers a potent and provocative central message concerning morality and responsibility. Moreover, it's acted with zest by an enthusiastic cast, with especially stand-out contributions from Jack Albertson as the doting Grandpa Joe, Roy Kinnear as the long-suffering Mr. Salt, Leonard Stone as the crass Mr. Beauregarde, and Gunter Meisner as the sinister Mr. Slugworth. Kudos are also in order for Arthur Ibbetson's vibrant cinematography and the marvelously catchy songs by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley. A sheer delight.",

            "content": "'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' has withstood the test of time. And though quite dated, it is still a widely enjoyed film (with good reason!). This movie had a magnificent performance by Gene Wilder as Wonka, a wonderful story and great art direction for its day as they brought all of the awesome things at the Wonka factory to life (how cool it would be if you could actually go to a place like that), to being a superb musical.The story is that of a famed chocolate manufacturer, Willy Wonka, who's factory is a magical secret that was shut down when competing candy companies kept trying to infiltrate the factory with their spies who wanted hold of the ingredients that made Wonka's candy the most novel and ultimately, the most novel. Of course, Wonka has a change of heart, and decides to hold a contest whereby the people who can find one of the five golden tickets randomly (maybe, all of the winners were conveniently children, four of which had horrible manners) in Wonka candy. It could be anywhere. One by one, it seems that the tickets are being found, particularly by obnoxious kids who are all about the same age. (Veruca Salt, the most horrid and funniest of them all, would later inspire a late 90s alternative band). The selfish British brat, the slothy German boy, the record gumchewer with the sleazy car salesman father, and the boy who lives in front of the television. And there's only one ticket left. Meanwhile, a pathetic, depressed little boy named Charlie Bucket wants nothing more than to get hold of one of those tickets and witness the magic of the Wonka factory. Well, cheer up Charlie, because its about to happen.The trip in Wonka is more than just an invitation for unrivaled fun, however. It is a test. One of Wonka's rivals known as Slugworth, has promised a valuable sum to each of the children who steal from Wonka one of his newest inventions -- an Everlasting Gobstopper-- so that his company might steal the ingredients. Will all remain loyal to Slugworth? This is one of Gene Wilder's best performances, perfectly making the Wonka character his own. This was also the movie that introduced to the world the cautionary cult favorite midgets known as the Oompa Loompas, slaves who were rescued by Wonka to...well serve as his slaves. And, serving as a brief psychedelic inject into the events in the factory, make the lessons learned more obvious than they could have already been. Charlie Bucket's character, however, could not be written to be more pathetic, as though the filmmakers were absolutely sure that this was the kid you had the most sympathy for. From the mother working in the laundry hand-washing clothes, to the bare one room house and the enormous bed shared by all of the grandparents with counterpart names, to Charlie's constantly furrowed brow and curled lip. But, aside from this minor flaw, the movie has so many memorable things about it. I particularly like the Dr. Suess-esque setting. I can see why Tim Burton might be asked to be the next to recreate the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, as the original looked like his style to begin with (like the foamy float machine or the bizarre sequence where Wonka appears to go momentarily mad). Nonetheless, may the legacy of the first live on for years to come. It is still one of the greatest family films ever made.",

But one day, he hears the news that Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) is sending out five golden tickets and then letting the winners go into his factory.

Charlie then wins the fifth golden ticket by luck.\nWilly Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is visually stunning and cleverly written. The songs are remarkable. The whole movie is a fun journey through the chocolate factory. It is very enjoyable, fun, and clever. The scenery and props are eye candy.\nThe most underrated character in the movie is Mr. Turkentine. He is only in three scenes, but everytime he is on screen he is hilarious. I love the quote: \"I've just decided to switch our Friday schedule to Monday, which means that the test we take each Friday on what we learned during the week will now take place on Monday before we've learned it. But since today is Tuesday, it doesn't matter in the slightest.\" He is very, very funny.\nJulie Dawn Cole plays Veruca so well. She is so bratty and she is one of those characters that you hate so much you love them. Roy Kinnear (who will be missed) is hysterical as her father.

            "content": "With the brand-new version of Tim Burton coming up, I thought it would be appropriate to watch the very first film-adaptation of Roald Dahl's popular children-novella first. Over 30 years old already, but this charming and moralistic fairy-tale still is a joy for all senses, with its likable main characters, exhilarating songs and valuable life-lessons. The movie might start out a little slow and overly dramatic with the extended portrait of the poor Charlie Bucket who has to work in order to support his family and he can only secretly dream about winning a grand tour in the wonderful chocolate factory owned by the mysterious Willy Wonka. But, when the miracle than occurs and Charlie walks into the factory together with four greedy kids, the movie REALLY takes off! The children and their adult companions are guided through the colorful landscapes and ingenious techniques of Wonka-world, where chocolate flows in rivers and candy bars can be taken out of TV-screens. This is a very fun movie and Dahl's rich but bizarre imagination is wonderfully put to the screen by Mel Stuart. The set pieces are magnificent and they really have the true magical feel of fantasy. Typical for Roald Dahl's work also is the slightly sinister and horrific touch, which is perfectly illustrated here in the unsettling boat-ride-through-the-cavern sequence. This particular scene is perhaps the most memorable one of the entire movie because of it's great use of sound and lighting! New surprises and eccentric plot-twists are provided every couple of seconds and Gene Wilder's jolly (but tempered) performance as the extravagant factory-owner really makes this movie complete. I can only hope the 2005 version will be as fabulous as this but I'm quite sure it will be. After all, if there's one team able to re-tell this insanely great tale, it has got to be Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" is like a big bar of chocolate: delicious...and you're never too old to enjoy it!",

Heck, I was just 9 back then, but this movie remains a wonder, 40+ years later. Not only do I have it now on DVD, I can sit through this endlessly. That's how good it is to me.Gene Wilder, who plays Wonka, is a very believable character here. I admire the way he portrayed his role as being one of \"pure imagination\", just as the storyline goes. The same goes for the entire cast. I had read Roald Dahl's \"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator', and this is so much like it.But...why my guilty pleasure? I have to snicker when I told her that both Julie Dawn Cole (Veruca Salt) and Denise Nickerson (Violet Beauregard) were my very first childhood crushes. She doesn't get mad, she just does when I watch the movie so much...for that reason. This is a very wonderful movie, has always been so close to my heart, and that's where it always will stay. As long as there is \"pure imagination\" indeed.Awesome indeed.",

I loved fantasy as a child and being whisked off to worlds with magic and wizards and strange creatures. Willy Wonka is set on Earth but not the Earth we know of. Willy Wonka's world is beautiful. Wonka is a benevolent old chocolate maker who invites some kids round to his chocolate factory where they can see all his delights and visit his magical world.The really great thing about a film like this is how it can whisk you off to another world.

For 1971, it's pretty good children's fare--much better than crap from the same era (such as CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG and DR. DOOLITTLE). Some may find all the singing annoying or complain that the songs are not the ones Roald Dahl wrote in the book (which appear in the remake), I still found them catchy and cute. In fact, I have no major complaints other than the stupid sequence where they are on the boat. All the awful and pointless images projected across the screen look cheap and gratuitous--unlike the rest of the film.However, I think that the BEST thing to do is to watch this and the recent remake and think of them as totally different movies. The 1971 film is a bit saccharine and kitschy but is still fun and memorable. The new Johnny Depp version is much darker and full of modern special effects. And, as a result they are so different, it's worth watching them both and DON'T compare them--just enjoy.",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie but I'm pretty sure it wasn't what I wound up viewing. I thought I would like the general feel of the thing but something about the movie felt off kilter. Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) seemed mean spirited at times, and almost indifferent at others, giving me the impression that the picture over all wasn't that kid friendly. I mean, four out of the five Golden Ticket winners wound up transported to some never never land never to be heard from again, while Charlie (Peter Ostrum) had to take it on the chin with his grandfather (Jack Albertson) for swiping some of the fizzy lifting drinks. That he wound up inheriting the Chocolate Factory seemed almost like a consolation prize given the tenor of the story.I did like the idea of the Golden Ticket contest, and have to wonder why more companies didn't follow up on the idea after this movie came out. It seemed like it would drive a lot of business and create excitement about a company's products. There's no denying the sets are colorful and imaginative, yet they seemed strangely surreal and fake at the same time. When I think back to the creativity on display in a film like \"The Wizard of Oz\" made three decades earlier, it's like this film didn't put the era's technology and artistry to any kind of use to look more polished. The thing is, the movie held out a lot of promise with the opening scenes of chocolate candy being made on a variety of assembly lines pumping out bars and candy kisses. And the scene in the candy shop took me back to the good old days of my youth when penny candy was the rule. I kind of feel sorry for today's youth who can't ever experience the thrill and/or frustration of making such a fateful decision with just a few available pennies in the sweaty palm of their hand. If you could pick up four of five pieces of penny candy today for under a buck you'd probably be lucky.",

            "content": "All over the world the chocolates and sweets of famed and enigmatic candy maker Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) are enjoyed by all as they wonder at how he makes such delicious sweets despite the factory having been closed off to the public after rivals sent in spies to steal his sweets. Eventually a contest is announced wherein within the wrappings of five Wonka chocolate bars Mr. Wonka has placed five Golden Tickets that will allow entry into his factory. The five tickets are eventually found by gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner), spoiled and bratty Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), gum chewing show-off Violet Beauregarde, TV obcessed Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen), and poor but sweet and good natured Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) are the winners and allowed entry into the wonderous candy factory but have all been approached by insidious candy magnate Arthur Slugworth (G\u00fcnter Meisner) who has offered rewards for being given an everlasting gobstopper from Wonka's factory.Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is an adaptation of the 1964 book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by author Roald Dahl. Director Mel Stuart's then 10 year-old daughter had read the book and asked her father to make a movie out of it with family friend and Stuart's producing partner David L. Wolper. By massive coincidence Wolper was in negotiations with the Quaker Oats company regarding a new vehicle to introduce a new candy bar from their confectioner's division (which has since been sold to Nestle along with the Wonka branding) and the company purchased rights to the book intent on using the film to promote the real life Wonka Bar. Roald Dahl had agreed to write the screenplay for Wolper, but only delivered an outline leading to some uncredited re-writes to fill in scenes (which Dahl disagreed with making Willy Wonka yet another Dahl adaptation that didn't meet the author's approval). Several actors auditioned for various roles in the film including Fred Astaire and Joel Grey who wanted the role of Wonka but were deemed too old and too short respectively, and reportedly Peter Sellers begged Dahl for the role of Wonka to no avail prior to Wilder's casting. While upon initial release the film was a minor disappointment making only $4 million against its $3 million budget resulting in Quaker Oats relinquishing their rights to the film to Warner Bros. For $500,000, the film grew in popularity almost a year after its release with TV airings increasing exposure to the film and impressive home media sales helping to ensure that the film became a staple of many people's childhoods and becoming as well regarded as classics such as Mary Poppins and Wizard of Oz, and rightly so because Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is a classic in all respects.From the opening sequence following the production of Willy Wonka's chocolate set to the incredibly memorable score by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, Willy Wonka sets up a tone of wonder and magic and captures the joy inherent to the sweets which the titular chcolate factory produces and the enduring wonderful song Candy Man at the sweets shop is near pitch perfect in setting up the wonder of this world. Peter Ostrum is really good as Charlie Bucket who's positioned as an \"everykid\" who despite being of lower means than other kids maintains a good heart but is also a kid who possesses flaws and even allows some selfishness and vitriol to his thoughts but not to the point he becomes unlikable or unrelatable. Scenes of Charlie sharing what few Wonka Bars he can get with his family or Grandpa Joe (Played wonderfully by Jack Albertson). Stuart used a method style of direction when handling the child actors often preventing the kids from knowing the full context of scenes prior to filming in order to elicit genuine surprise and amazement from them and that undeniably comes through in the final product with the kids and their personalities well defined and very distinguished. The movie features some terrific humor such as the various vignettes of the buying frenzy of Wonka Bars that comes after Wonka announces the contest with some very funny bits involving a super computer, a psychiatrist, and especially a kidnap and ransom still being very funny.Structurally the movie is really well done with Charlie kept as the main focus for the movie with Willy Wonka kept mostly absent until we actually get to the Chocolate Factory which helps to build the mystique of this world and the eponymous chocolatier. Roald Dahl apparently didn't like this movie very much, and one of the reasons he stated was because the film focused too much on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie. I really have to laugh at this statement because considering how enigmatic Wonka is in the film and he doesn't show up until halfway into the movie, Charlie is positioned as he should be as the audience proxy and his journey with the emotional payoff at the end of the film feels earned and true to the spirit of the story. Tim Burton would \"reimagine\" this story in 2005 with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and despite that movie allegedly being closer to the book it pushed Charlie further into the background with more focus brought to Depp's portrayal of Wonka.Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is still a classic and for good reason. Much like films such as Mary Poppins and Wizard of Oz, the film creates a world of colorful fantasy but with an edge of intelligence and wit that respects the audience regardless of age so both children and adults can enjoy the movie together (there might even be a bit more for adults). I love this movie and have seen it dozens of times before and I'm sure I'll see it dozens of times more.",

            "content": "Roald Dahl's Grimm-like book \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" gets a careful, pointed musical treatment here, involving five Golden Ticket-winning tykes who get to tour a mysterious candy factory--at their own expense. Turns out the journey is a test of their personalities and upbringings, and the film is a little presumptuous to suggest that the poorest kid may be the most noble and honest (as if all rich kids were rotten). The opening moments and TV commentaries on the race to find the tickets are littered with smart satire and a particular kind of dry-ice British humor which may confound kids but should delight grown-ups. Once inside the factory, the film coasts happily along on Gene Wilder's coattails (he's incredibly nutty, occasionally a jerk, but always unpredictable). The screwy Wonkatania boat ride is a highlight, with gross-out flickers on a screen that really are a freak-out. Yes, some of the songs are a drag, but I loved Veruca Salt's number \"I Want It Now!\" (she really wants ten thousand tons of ice cream??); \"The Candy Man\" is a classic and, I may be in the minority here, I thought \"Cheer Up, Charlie\" was a sweet lament. The movie is uneven and a bit grotesque, but it sends kids out on a high and doesn't bore parents, and that's a plus for family films. Critics dismissed it in 1971 (Pauline Kael described it as \"Prussians at play,\" which I'm pretty sure is an insult) and Dahl himself publicly nixed it, but it has bratty kids getting what they deserve, a fabulous looking factory, and wild-eyed, frizzy-haired Wilder at his peak. His performance is like an Everlasting Gobstopper; it will live on and on. ***1/2 from ****",

Of all the stuff I've seen him in this is the most indelible performance and character he performed and created for the silver screen. I hope I don't sound like I'm fawning, but the sarcastic quips and baiting he provide in his Wonka character are exacting and just simply laugh-out-loud hilarious.To me this is one of the last of the great non-Disney children's films. Made in a day and age when process shots were expensive and hard to produce, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory rely on the musical trend of the time, but do so successfully I think. So much that I think modern contemporary audiences, most of whom disdain the musical genre, will go along with the numbers as part of the narrative, and not as something meant to draw attention to themselves for the sake of adornment.Even in my middle age I am delighted by this film, and even though I knew the film backwards and forwards like a lot of other adults who saw this film when it first premiered on the big screen in 1971, I still felt a thrill when Charlie has his big moment of luck. I felt like a boy all over again. And when Willy Wonka makes his smiling remarks to the various comments and actions made by his guests touring his establishment, I simply could not hold back my laughter.Even as a teen and 20-something when I saw this film I smiled at both the story and the Wonka character, as well as at Charlie and his family.To me Willy Wonka was made in a time when there was still a kind of understood (all be it tacit) \"respect\" for the spirit of the ever so repressive rules of the former Hayes' office that had clamped down on a lot of perceived \"immorality\" portrayed in films. Nobody wants to take their kid to a film with a lot of sex and explicit gory violence. And where everyone has a kind of innate understanding of what is proper and improper, to me Willy Wonka has that kind of essence of truly making a family film, or a G-rated film that can be enjoyed by everyone.The script is intelligent and witty, the child actors are truly marvelous in this, and the leads and supporting cast do their usual exceptional bang up job. And the music isn't half bad either.Colorful, a bit slower paced in terms of editing, but no less full of zest for modern conventional story telling style, Willy Wonka is the kind of film they don't make anymore but should. And kudos to the entire cast, and in particular Gene Wilder for giving us the sly eccentric genius whose quest for character is fulfilled superbly.A great film. Get a copy or stream it for yourself, or with those you love.Enjoy.",

As for the things that the remake did better, I like the scene in which Charlie insists to share the chocolate because it's his birthday so he can do whatever he wants to, I like the grandpa dance scene better, I like the family backstory with dad losing his job and grandpa being an ex-worker in the factory, I like the dark backstory of Willy Wonka and I guess I like the spoiled kids a lot more in the remake as they felt a bit more realistic and not over-the-top overly-stereotypical as in the original. But even with all these things, the original is still highly superior.I must say that I have a few problems with this film, one being that what the hell was wrong with the beginning. The family barely has any money and the old man wants to quit smoking to save money and lead a healthier lifestyle, yet the family insists on him to keep smoking... Also, I can't believe that Charlie and his grandpa broke the rules during one part of the film especially when before they despited others breaking the rules. Also, the fat kid is not fat enough haha. But that's all I have for the flaws of this otherwise magical film.But now to the good parts. This film has some of the most charming and heartwarming sets I've ever seen, so much colour and so cute. The songs are very good, they're memorable and iconic. Most of the dialogues are very smart, two-sided and meaningful. Humor is truly ahead of its time, still holds up as if the jokes were made today. Acting is phenomenal, especially by Gene Wilder. But most importantly watching it with the theory of Willy Wonka being a serial killer makes this truly an original and thought-provoking film and it seems that all checks out perfectly.

            "content": "This entire movie is just so magical. Roald Dahl, the author of the book on which the film is based, is known the world over for being one of the most prolific children's book writers, but many don't realize that the books aren't just appealing to children. James and The Giant Peach, Danny the Champion of the World, The Witches, and Willy Wonka are all well written stories for the most part, and so movie adaptations feeding off their success started to predictably appear. Out of all of Dahl's books to be turned into movies, this one is without a doubt the most famous, and it's not hard to see why. The movie's plot is about the titular Willy Wonka who owns a mysterious chocolate factory that nobody can have access to. Soon, Wonka announces that there is a contest that involves people buying his chocolate bars and finding golden tickets hidden inside. The winner receives a tour of his strange factory, but since there are only 5 tickets in the entire world, it's way easier said than done. A modest boy named Charlie is the story's unlikely protagonist, he is humble enough to not let the temptation of finding a golden ticket control his life. He doesn't expect to find one, and his family is much more important to him than a bunch of candy. As time goes by, the golden tickets start getting discovered by lucky children from various locations around the world, but the kids who win are all spoiled and don't really deserve them. A gluttonous German kid named Augustus is the first winner, followed by Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, and Mike Teevee. Finally, Charlie manages by pure luck to find a ticket after the original fifth winner is proved to be a fake. Out of all the children who win, Charlie is the only decent one that doesn't have a snarky, in-your-face attitude, and it makes the audience sympathize with him. The rest of the movie involves Charlie being taken on a tour (along with the other children) of Wonka's factory while he is chaperoned by his formerly bedridden grandfather. Wonka shows them all kinds of strange candy related things, from waterfalls made of melted chocolate to drinks that allow the consumer to float. There's a shocking false ending where Charlie, as the only remaining member of the tour after all the other kids have been eliminated, asks Wonka about the promised lifetime supply of chocolate, and Wonka tells him he's not getting any as he \"broke the rules\" by stealing the lifting drinks. Charlie's grandfather suggests to Charlie he should get even with Wonka by giving the recipes for some of his secret Candy to his adversary Slugworth, but Charlie returns the gobstopper to Wonka instead. As it turns out, this whole part was just a test of morals that only Charlie was decent enough to pass, and Wonka tells Charlie that his family now has legal ownership over his factory. The performances in this movie are all amazing, especially Wilder's, and he was without a doubt the best Willy Wonka ever. Also an interesting note about this movie, the part at the end where Wonka yells at Charlie for violating the rules is actually non-rehearsed, and Charlie didn't know Gene was going to yell at him. This allowed the filmmakers to get his real reaction.",

            "content": "I think it's pretty safe to say that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a timeless classic. Not only does it feature a great plot, fantastic acting and show how movies don't have to be full of computer animation to be good, but it also features some of the best music I have ever heard in a movie.I still remember, almost as clearly as if it were yesterday, the remarkable thing the movie did to me the first time I watched it: It completely changed my mind about musicals! I was about 10 years old when I first sat down and watched the movie. Like a lot of kids, I didn't much care for musical numbers in movies. So when the music for \"Pure Imagination\" started playing, I thought, \"Oh great, a musical number!\" I was just about to press the fast-forward button when Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) began singing.Within about two seconds, I was completely mesmerized! I didn't think I had ever heard such a beautiful song in my life, nor had I heard too many singing voices that were as beautiful as Willy's. It felt like he was singing that song as much to me as he was to the kids and parents in the movie! That song certainly captured MY imagination, and after hearing it for the first time, I saw musicals in a whole new light.I may be grown now, but I still like the movie every bit as much as I did as a ten-year-old....and I will always have a special spot in my heart for \"Pure Imagination\" the song that convinced me that musicals can be some of the best movies out there!",

            "content": "SPOILERS Roald Dahl is perhaps one of the most famous names in children's entertainment. Author of stories like 'The BFG', 'The Witches' and 'Matilda', Dahl's stories have given joy to children for a long time now. With so many of his stories being made into films, it's not difficult to see that Hollywood loves him too. In 1971, one of his finest stories was made into a musical starring Gene Wilder. Magnificantly 'odd', Wilder's Willy Wonka is a genuinely surreal performance. Twenty years on, and an inferior sequel later, and Wilder is still the way to go. The film might be dated, but with a Wonka like this, it's impossible not to fall in love with the film again.Charlie Bucket's (Peter Ostrum) family are incredibly poor. Living with his mum and four grandparents, Charlie dreams of better things. When the mysterious Willy Wonka (Wilder) announces that five lucky children will be allowed to tour his chocolate factory, Charlie has a dream. Receiving one chocolate bar on his birthday however, the odds are stacked against him. Still, this is a fairy tale, so you can imagine what's coming next.Filmed in Eastern Europe and with five children paid on the cheap, 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' is full of legends on screen and off. Colourful and beautiful throughout, it possesses many amazing scenes.As far as children performers go, the three kids do an alright job. Ostrum and Julie Dawn Cole (playing the greedy Veruca Salt) in particular are singled out for praise as they jump, run, sing and perform for the camera at every possibility. Ultimately though, the children will always be overshadowed by Gene Wilder.Wilder takes insanity to a new level. One moment seeming totally normal, and the next randomly talking and singing to himself, Wilder's Wonka is a man on the edge. You watch him and you just know that he could win your heart whilst simultaneously scare you senseless. You certainly have to wonder what Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) is thinking when Wonka hugs Charlie towards the end. Ultimately though, however nuts Wilder is in this film, it is him who makes it watchable so many years later.Well, Wilder mostly, but let's be honest, another reason for always enjoying this film is the regular song and dance of the Oompa Loompas. 'vertically challenged' (or whatever the PC description is now) individuals painted orange with green hair could just look incredibly offensive and weird. Dress them in weird outfits and have them sing catchy tunes though and automatically they become figures of fun. Yes there are definite indications towards the slave trade, but for family films, the Oompa Loompas are people that children never forget.'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' is a film many of us grew up with and love. Beautiful and bright, it is always a joy to watch. Led by an amazing performance by Gene Wilder and the songs of the Oompa Loompas, the film has many treasured moments that you can't help but fall for. By modern standards, the film does look slightly dated, but with so many magic moments, this is easily forgivable. Pure family fun.",

'Remember what happens to the man who got everything he wanted? He lived happily eve after...'It's one of the last lines in the film, and while it's spoken to Charlie, it's really about Wonka himself. He found someone - someone he could trust with his secrets. And, Charlie learned that, being honest does pay off.Another line from the film; ''So shines a good deed in a weary world,' which while, originally from Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, still resounds with much meaning.There are some 'perennials,' in the film, and, this one shines as one that every child, can love, and, grow up, to share with theirs.",

It's a bright and colourful musical that screams twee throughout and has somewhat been superseded in the public's imagination by Tim Burton's ill-advised rehash, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.However a little digging beneath the surface reveals a slightly disturbing and horrific yarn of infanticide, in which young children are led unsuspectingly to various terrifying fates (being squeezed, stretched, and \"juiced\" to name but three). It's a film in which subliminal images of millipedes crawling over people's faces and a chicken being beheaded are inserted into one darned scary boat-tunnel ride and the twinkly eyes of Gene Wilder may just be hiding a sinister madman behind them. As such this film can be enjoyed both as a family classic and as a subtle chilling horror story.",

            "content": "This movie is about as good as it gets, barring the tedious first 30 minutes before Gene Wilder comes on screen. But all the better, his entrance is perhaps the most memorable one in cinematic history (yes, better than Orson Welles in \"The Third Man\").Willie Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is NOT a kid's movie. It is saturated with literary allusions (Shakespeare galore), musical references (that was Mozart, not Rachmaninoff!) and a quirky sense of humour that only a mature audience will truly get. For that reason, I can understand why many of the kids today disparage this classic in light of the 2005 version with its CGI special effects and Johnny-the-hottie Depp. But for the purists who enjoy a good, powerful performance without the fluff, this is the film for you.What amazes me about this film is that it is really quite dark and cynical, despite its colorful and upbeat appearance. The candy man Willie Wonka is at times a malevolent and frightening presence with a jaded, almost hopeless view of life. But despite it all, he makes us laugh uncontrollably and sing along and revisit our childhood as only an madman can. Whether this was in the original screenplay or whether it was Gene Wilder's own tinting I don't know, although I suspect the latter. For that reason I'm sure it deviates significantly from the theme of the original children's book. But I wouldn't have it any other way.",

Now my first contact with the story was with the remake. Which isn't great but not terrible either. But this movie is on another level. The level you wish for when putting on a fantasy family film.The musical sections are so well done, I love how they are kept contained and they make them that much more personal when they need to be. Normally I kind of daze off when the musical section gets so big and random folk start to join in, but that's never the case here. The characters are just 10/10 I love all of them. From the annoying to the charming and kind. You simply cannot not find Charlie endearing, and his grandpa just as much. And talking about the musical aspect, the songs here are fantastic and as we have all experienced: so very memorable.The directing is surprisingly fresh, I love the special sections during the Oompa Loompa songs. With the funky text and framing. The directing overall is simply great, something to say coming from a director that had only done documentaries before.Any moment with Wilder is one you want to hold on to and never end. His performance is enchanting and something you keep looking forward to. But it didn't overshadow the others as I enjoyed them just as much.The comedy imo, still works. There's a ton of quick jokes that would fly over a kids head. So there is much to laugh here not just at the slapstick humor that's there for the kids but also the comedy within the dialog.The set design.. I don't think there is much to say other than that it's art. Whilst the Tim Burton remake has this quality as well, the practicality in the original here has that extra something. Even though you could see some of the candy as being red tubing or balloons, for some reason the authenticity is endearing towards the whole movie.Overall I really enjoyed my time with this classic.",

Roald Dahl's mild cautionary tale on the pitfalls of consumerism, greed (still relevant today in our mass - advertising, obesity-conscious society) is presented pleasantly for the cinema and has a winning turn at its heart by Gene Wilder. The children can't quite act their lines but the adults support well (with a fair smattering of British comedy staples like Roy Kinnear, Tim Brooke Taylor and others on board). The music is fair, certainly not up to \"Oliver\" standards, with the well-known \"Candy Man\" standing out in a less than brilliant vocal performance by the shopkeeper although, to be fair, none of the lead singers is particularly exceptional. The special effects are okay, fine for the time, a bit dated now especially considering the wonders of Tim Burton's big - budget remake, and not too much of the confectionery looks truly scrumptious, to borrow a phrase, but some of the shots (especially the process shot above the rooftops at the end) are embarrassingly processed. The Oompa Loompahs, I suppose, evoke the Munchkins of Oz but are less characterful and really just act as decoration only.

            "content": "Willy Wonka is not a nice man. Yet, somehow, you can't help but like him, at least as he's played by Gene Wilder in \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\" the semi-psychedelic, and \"psychotronic,\" 1971 version of Roald Dahl's classic children's novel. Wonka is aloof, sardonic, sarcastic, mysterious, manipulative, and devious--a leprechaun with a hyperactive thyroid and an edge. But, as Wilder plays him, you sense the sweetness behind the wild gleam in his eyes; he's really hoping that one of the five children he's invited to tour his chocolate factory will be a worthy heir to the world of his imagination.Yes, Wonka is a cynic and a misanthrope. (What else could he be after sequestering himself in his own little world for years on end?) But he wants to believe that there is still some good to be found in a \"weary world.\" Wilder captures Dahl's creation perfectly.The rest of the cast is perfect, too, and they make the most of Dahl's often witty script. Peter Ostrom, in particular, is excellent as Charlie.Yet, this minor classic of a movie has its flaws. The production design suffers from a lack of budget. Wonka's \"Chocolate Room\" looks like an elaborate mini-golf course, with a dirty river running through it, in a brick warehouse. The \"Inventing Room\" is meant to be a whimsical, magical laboratory, but comes off more like an especially elaborate hideout for the Joker on the old \"Batman\" TV series. The songs range from reasonably good (Veruca Salt's ode to brattiness \"I Want the Whole World\") to saccharine (\"The Candy Man\") to downright wretched (the Oompa-Loompa oeuvre entire, with lousy choreography to match). Wilder's rendition of \"Pure Imgaination,\" an overly sugary confection that could induce diabetic comas in the wrong hands, works thanks to the faraway look in his eyes; he makes it magical. The make up and costumes of the Oompa-Loompas (Wonka's workers), on the other hand, are simply embarrassing.Yet despite these flaws, \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" is hugely entertaining and probably the best family film of the 1970s. Think of it this way: \"Willy Wonka\" is to Burton's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" as the \"Batman\" TV series (from the 1960s) is to Burton's \"Batman.\" Both are different, entirely valid takes on the same source material. Both are worth watching.",

            "content": "After all these years, I feel that this movie still hasn't lost any of its charm or power. It's one that should really speak to every kid's imagination and to those who still have a little child hidden somewhere inside of them. And isn't that basically being everybody on this world? I absolutely still have some problems with this movie but I feel that none of this makes this movie any less of a great and fun experience. In essence it's being a very simple and straightforward movie, in which just a whole bunch of random insane and wonderful stuff happens, the moment they step into Willy Wonka's factory. This is a movie that doesn't need to explain anything. It can let things simply happen and it shows that fantasy has no limitations. You could wish whatever you want from and sometimes dreams come true, as happens to little Charlie in this movie.It's a wonderful, imaginative, fantasy movie, that besides is a great looking one. It has wonderful visuals and colors in it and most importantly, it doesn't look fake! It all looks as if it could be part of the real world and it looks as if every machine really works and all the candy is eatable and tastes wonderful as well.It really looks like Gene Wilder had a great time playing his role. He goes all out, without coming across as insane. It probably is a more subtle performance than most people give him credit for. He is a great comedy character, who besides is capable of placing himself in a kid's world and their fantasy. This doesn't feel like a movie written and made by adults for kids but more like one that in fact got made by kids.It's definitely thanks to Roald Dahl's writing, who of course also wrote the book this movie was based on, that this movie comes to life. He manages to put really a lot into the movie its characters and overall atmosphere. It besides provides the movie with some absolutely great dialog and at time it wants to make you rewind the movie, just to check if you really heard things right. But as I said before, it's being still far from a perfect movie, for me. I have always felt and thought that the beginning of the movie goes on for a bit too long and might be a bit too boring, for young kids especially. I also always thought it was strange that the movie never showed what happened to all of the other kids and what happened to Charlie and his family. The ending feels a bit too rushed and also comes far too sudden. There is no real good buildup to it and it might even be a bit confusing to those who aren't familiar with the book.But despite of all these minor issues, this movie remains a perfectly watchable and fun movie to watch for children and those who still are in touch with their inner child, or have a rich imagination.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory (1971) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline follows an infamous chocolate factory that has been closed to the public for some time. One inauspicious day an announcement is released that five lucky children will be allowed to visit the factory with one lucky winner receiving a special prize. The five children will be determined by their ability to find golden tickets distributed within chocolate bars that have been sent all over the world.This movie is directed by Mel Stuart (The White Lion) and stars Gene Wilder (Young Frankenstein), Jack Albertson (The Poseidon Adventure), Peter Ostrum, Michael Bollner, Roy Kinnear (Scrooge), Julie Dawn Cole (Poldark) and Denise Nickerson (Smile).This movie is an all time cinematic gem. The storyline is unique, magical and breathtaking. The settings, plots and subplots are very well portrayed and told. They do a great job of exaggerating the situations to draw in the audience. The characters are perfectly portrayed and were well cast and Wilder is out of this world as Willy Wonka. The factory really captures the imagination and makes you wish you were there. The soundtrack and music numbers are brilliant and portray the lessons perfectly.There's nothing I would change about this masterpiece. It's a perfect family film that is a must see and own. I would score this a perfect 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",

But as an adult, it's surprisingly creepy. And that's not just the Oompah Loompahs; there's a subtle malevolence to Wonka himself, and that really adds a new dimension to the movie. Clearly, I'm not the only one who wanted Veruca to suffer a miserable fate, right? The songs are good and the message of honesty still rings true today, but the movie really belongs to Gene Wilder. He was a real showman in the role, and his comic timing is a huge reason why the movie is so enjoyable after so many years. I don't usually watch a movie in memory of the deceased, and in this case, it just seemed like the right time to revisit this one. Even so, R.I.P. Mr. Wilder.8/10",

            "content": "There have been many movie adaptations of the great Welsh children's author Roald Dahl, to various degrees of success. I used to love his books as a youth, relishing the dark twists and the playful, if somewhat dark, humour. Yet even the best adaptations didn't really capture the sinister themes behind the best of Dahl's works, but that was up until I saw this, Mel Stuart's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Dahl's most popular works. As well as being often psychedelic, it is Gene Wilder's wild yet subtle portrayal of the unpredictable and possibly quite evil Willy Wonka that truly captures Dahl's essence.Poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) lives in a cramped house with his mother and the bed-ridden Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). The news announces that the reclusive Willy Wonka of Wonka's chocolate company is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for five lucky children to come and see his world-famous factory. Five golden tickets have been placed in Wonka Bars throughout the world, and Charlie, finding the fifth and final ticket, arrives with Grandpa Joe along with fellow winners Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) and Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) to meet the eccentric inventor.This is one of those popular films that everyone had seemed to seen apart from me, so I was expecting a familiar family film full of catchy songs and annoying freckly kids. The songs, apart from the famous 'Pure Imagination', are somewhat forgettable, but I was surprised by the effective performance from the children, and the sheer darkness of the film. Apart from the various disappearances of the increasingly bratty, greedy and ungrateful children (who aren't actual seen again), the boat ride that Wonka takes his party on is particularly unnerving. There are bright, flashing lights, strange music, and various disturbing imagery (including a chicken being decapitated) that infest the screen, making me wonder if I was in fact watching a children's movie, or some f****d- up acid trip from the 70's.Gene Wilder has made many films that portray his energy and comedic ability that often borders on genius, but he blew me away as Wonka. From his entrance, shuffling along on his cane only to do a somersault in front of the awe-struck crowd, to his furious outburst at the climax, makes Wonka an almost threatening presence, never allowing us to feel completely comfortable when he's on screen. He's ultimately a misanthrope, with only a glimmer of hope that one of the children he's welcomed to his home is truly worthy of inheriting his life's work, using subtle glances or whispers of poetry to merely hint at his true personality. Along with the beautiful sets and solid supporting cast, Willy Wonka was a complete surprise, and surely the best Dahl adaptation that's yet to grace the screen.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "I saw this at ten when it first came out and enjoyed it. I have squeezed some nostalgia value out of it since. Gene Wilder is wonderful as Willy Wonka (if perhaps too young to have had all the life experiences discussed early on in the film). Still, to kids, everyone who is not a kid is old.The problem with the movie is the cutting of corners. The movie was originally sponsored by a food company who meant to make a mint marketing various Wonka bars, but that never got off the ground. In other words, it was a big commercial for a product that never came off (though some Wonka products do exist to this day).The story of the movie is a tale of producer David Wolper cutting costs however he can to streamline a budget. Two big stars of the period, Sammy David Jr. and Anthony Newly (who co-wrote the songs) showed interest in playing the candy man at the beginning, and being able to sing \"The Candy Man.\" Both were nixed. Wolper suggested having a big star might interfere with the fantasy--but it also meant paying a star's salary. He might have gotten either for a cut rate, but foolishly rejected them, perhaps damaging the box office and certainly ruining the song, which became a big hit for Sammy Davis, Jr. anyway.Then, according to the book PURE IMAGINATION, some wanted the \"Golden Ticket\" song turned into a huge production number (see \"Consider Yourself\" in OLIVER or \"Every Sperm is Sacred\" in THE MEANING OF LIFE). It's a good song that seems to call for a big production number. But Wolper, no doubt with an eye on expenses, decided it would work better in a more intimate (and more boring) setting.My final criticism is Roald Dahl's fault. His original CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY had the oompa-loompas singing terribly moralistic songs that go on even longer than the truncated versions in the films! After they enter the chocolate factory, apart from one song from Veruca Salt, all they have are the repetition of the oompa-loompa's moralistic ditties against gum, television, etc. What a bunch of (if you pardon the term) blue-nosed bores.The film desperately needs an \"eleven o'clocker.\" These are songs near the end of shows (usually half an hour before Broadway shows used to let out at 11:30, and the audience may be tired) that are either comic (\"Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat\" from GUYS AND DOLLS; stirring (\"Oklahoma\" from OKLAHOMA!; or perhaps martial, with a neat military cadence. Instead, \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" just sort of trickles out to the end, in the Great Glass Elevator.Some scenes do work, but even they have flaws. The \"Chocolate Room\" takes the breath away on an initial viewing (esp. in the theaters) and the song \"Pure Imagination\" is arguably the best in the show. But then one wonders--why didn't they decorate the posts holding up the roofs, perhaps to look like candy canes? Was that more cost-cutting? And the chocolate river never looked anything to me but repulsive, even when I was ten and willing to believe.Some of the effects look cheesy in the twenty-first century. Overall, this is a better version than the twisted vision of Tim Burton that came out later, with the androgenous Willy Wonka and the unnecessary backstory that Dahl, for all his faults, never included. In fact, his Wonka is a jolly little chap rather than bizarre as in Burton's tale, or perhaps bipolar in this version.Gene Wilder is mostly restrained for a pretty good performance to follow up his brilliant breakthrough in Mel Brooks' \"The Producers.\" The kids are mostly surprisingly good actors, especially the bickering girls. Three good songs (including \"Pure Imagination\" and the all but ruined \"Candy Man\"). The boy playing Charlie is good but his hair is right out of the 1970s and it clashes with the timeless, nameless, old-world village where he lives.Also, keep an eye out for David Battley as the annoyingly hilarious Mr. Turkentine. Tim Brooke-Taylor from \"The Goodies\" has an amusing bit as a computer operation. And some welcome dark-comedic vignettes during the hunt for the golden ticket should please adults who are trying to persuade their kids a half-century-old movie with shoddy effects is worth the waste of a dull afternoon.",

            "content": "There's a message behind the darkness of Willy Wonka's wacky chocolate factory here, and that is if you are a glutton, a gum chewer with a massive ego, a spoiled brat or a television addict, you will not inherit the Kingdom of Willy. This is one of those strange stories that is probably not for infant children, maybe best for 10 years and up, and probably better for mature adults who can look back at this years after first seeing it to determine what Ronald Dahl was trying to say in his story of gooey goodness. There's no gooey feeling about the story. This is purely adult fare with visual treats for the kids, and a few scary moments as well. Willy Wonka in a sense appears to be a metaphor for some spiritual being utilizing a rather materialistic method in order to find out who will be the grand prize winner for his kingdom. In a sense, he's a bit like God, as some literary critics and movie historians have determined Frankenstein's monster and Edward Scissorhands to be a metaphor for Jesus.Peter Ostrum is Charlie Bucket, one of five lucky recipients of the golden ticket, and he is indeed a sweet, unselfish child. The four other winners range from horrid (Veruca Salt) to grossly obese (Augustus Gloop) to obnoxious (Mike Teevee) to somewhat of a braggart (the more likable Violet Beauregarde) and their parents are just as horrid. Charlie takes along his beloved grandpa Joe (a wonderful Jack Albertson) who was bedridden along with his wife and Charlie's other two grandparents (think of \"Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice\" meet \"Cocoon\" and Maude, as in \"Harold and...\"). The visual of the four elderly in-laws in the same bed is probably enough of a nightmare in itself let alone what Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) has in store for them.The Wonka factory is a fun house in itself, with coat and hat racks that literally can grip what is being placed on it, an \"Alice in Wonderland\" like tiny door that opens to a world of pure imagination, a beautiful steamboat run by orange faced little people that goes into the tunnel of hell, a goose that lays golden chocolate eggs, a piece of gum that turns little girls into giant blueberries, a room filled of gas filled liquid that threatens to carve its drinkers into sliced cold cuts, and a television like machine that shrinks big things into little things, like bratty children. Of course, Wonka's garden is the most beautiful of these segments, and in each one, sin is dealt with as each nasty child prepares to get their come-uppance.Some critics may call Charlie too perfect to be real, but there are indeed children out there with his sweetness and love, and that is what Willy Wonka's God-like character is searching for. Each child is given the test because of a villain named Slugworth, and it is easy to see who will pass, who will fail. The Oompah Loompas are a \"Harry Potter\" like version of Oz's Munchkins, and after each child fails their test, these wisened little men sing the moral of what that child needed to learn. The music and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse features one of the top movie themes of all time, \"The Candy Man\" (made into a hit single by Sammy Davis Jr.; sung by a candy store clerk here), and \"Pure Imagination\" is equally as memorable.This takes on what some of the Disney musicals lack, and that is an appealing lesson for adults to pass on to their children. As Willy Wonka says, it is possible that some of these children will come out a bit better than they were before, although you can lay odds on the nasty Veruca Salt turning into a British version of either Leona Helmsley or Monica Lewinsky in her selfish quest for \"I Want It Now!\".",

It was slow, patronising and contrived from the outset. Unfortunately; if you'd read the book, you knew pretty well what was coming next. And the trouble then was that the sets and props never lived up to the imagination.Tempo inside the choc-works didn't improve. The 'Oompa Loompa' song just about saw me dozing off. As to Gene Wilder's Wonka; I couldn't mesh with him at all, not even as a fantasy character. His mood-swings were actually a wee bit scary. And when he was being meaningfully nice, it really made me rather cringe. Much too sweet for my tastes. The sets were as colourful as a kids' fantasy movie could be, but they never stopped looking cheap and stagy. The dialogue was trite, the surprises unsurprising. Frankly; I think 5 stars is a generous award.The ancient 'Wizard Of Oz' could kick this into a sweet-vat with a glass slipper. It is superior by any evaluation. At first, I thought this was because I'm not a Wilder fan, but there's been a recent remake employing Johnny Depp in the Willy Wonka role. Sadly, that one didn't do anything for me either.I dunno; everyone seems to love it but me. I'm an outcast and a pariah.

I'm not a huge fan of the new version because Johnny Depp isn't one of my favorite actors and the way Wonka is portrayed drives me crazy. I always felt like Wonka should be the person that he's portrayed as in this version.He's a nice candy maker that hides in his candy shoppe. Then he invites five people to go into the shoppe only if they find the golden tickets hidden in his candy bars. When Charlie finds a golden ticket, he decides to take his grandfather with him as the only guest he's allowed to bring. They have the tour of the candy shoppe and are the last ones left at the end. At some point Wonka promises one of the five the candy factory, but refuses to give it to Charlie because of the fizzy lifting drink scene that he doesn't reveal that he knew about the incident until the very end of the film. Charlie feels guilty and returns the everlasting gobstopper which was all part of the plan. Wonka was waiting for one of the children to return the gobstopper and Charlie was the only one left at this point. Wonka gets super excited and exclaims his congratulations. At this point Charlie is super confused by this and when Slugworth comes through a door. Slugworth had asked Charlie to give him the gobstopper at the end so he could figure out how it was made. Charlie learns that Slugworth really works for Wonka and it was designed as a character test. Charlie gets the factory and the movie ends with the famous glass elevator scene.Having grown up with this version, I was quite disgusted by the way the film was redone with Johnny Depp. I've heard that the new version was closer to the book, but I really don't care.

Taking his Grandpa Joe, he is in for the adventure of a lifetime as the tour takes him and four other kids to some wacky and imaginative areas.Yeah, it is weird, but it a legendary film. However, Ronald Dahl would disown this due to the changes Warner Bros. would make to the story (resulting in the studio being banned from making a sequel). including making Slugworth a villain, and the many songs added in. IMHO, I prefer this over the 2005 remake (which was more accurate). The songs (especially the Oompa Loompa songs) are memorable, Gene Wilder does a good job as Willy Wonka, and when we get to the chocolate factory tour that makes up the second half of the film, a lot of the sets are well done (especially the chocolate room), proving that movies can be creative in a time without computer animation.

Granted, Gene Wilder has always been good (especially when co-starring with Richard Pryor), but this version of \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" was pretty hokey.

Released during a period of Disney musicals and an era of the Vietnam War (hence the title change, originally Charlie and the Chocolate Factory).Gene Wilder made it even more special. His portayal of choclatier Willy Wonka is one of his more memorable roles outside of a Mel Brooks film. Wilder was the best choice as Wonka, as I don't believe anyone could have played the part better (not even Johnny Depp). Wilder is probably the only person that audiences can name from the cast nowadays. The music was entertaining, and the Oompa Loompas were pretty funny. Willy Wonka is reminiscent of the days of The Wizard of Oz, the same sort of magic.As weird as some sequences we're at the time, it's definitely a better version than Tim Burton created. This version has been parodied so many times in other mediums, including cartoons, it will always be popular.The songs are especially great, and somewhat memorable. Especially the Oompa Loompa song. Even Wilder sings a song. It's great fun for the whole family.",

            "content": "Willy Wonka has long since locked his factory doors and operates in seclusion to produce wonderful chocolate without the risk of industrial spies.  However he decides to open his factory doors to 5 lucky people who can find the golden tickets hidden in 5 of his bars.  Charlie is a poor, honest kid who longs for the chance.  When he finds a ticket he and 4 other children from around the world get the chance to enter the weird world of chocolate production with their guide, Willy Wonka himself.Based on the Roald Dahl book `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' this film is a wonderful little piece of imagination and whimsy.  It is fun to watch for adults and children mainly because of it's endless imagination \u0096 it simply doesn't draw the line at anything, it is colourful bright and fantastic.  The film has plenty of jokes that only adults will get but also much for kids to appreciate \u0096 I know that is the norm nowadays in kids films but remember this was 1971!As implied in the title, the film takes the focus off Charlie and puts it on Wonka himself.  This is good because Charlie, bless him, is quite a dry little so and so!  Putting the focus on Wonka is a good move and doesn't stop at the title \u0096 Wonka is the sole of the film and much of the humour comes from him.  Wilder is the only choice for the role and he pitches it perfectly, being understated and not going over the top at any real point. His dry style of humour is used well and he is as flamboyant and unusual as his surroundings.  Albertson is good as Joe and Kinnear is recognisable as Salt.  Overall the child actors all do good work being as horrible as their characters require.  I felt like Ostrum got the short straw as his character is far too moral to be of great interest, I felt like I was only rooting for him because the rest were so horrid.Some of the music is quite poor.  No, scratch that, the majority of the songs are poor or just lack lustre.  None of them are really catchy or funny and none are that well choreographed.  Only the Ompah-Lumpah song really catches my ear. It's a shame because the songs near the mid point really serve to slow the film down a bit.  However despite this I still found it fun to watch.Over 30 years old and this is still a lot more fun than the CGI filled, soulless live-action kids films that seem to be doing the rounds of late (yes Harry Potter I'm looking at you).",

Granted I haven't read every book and read every movie, but I have read the book \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" and yes it does have the same plot and moral, but there are so many changes made.OK, the reason I love this film is because of a few things. The actors are great, every child fits the role perfectly. And Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka. The songs are super catchy, and the special effects are outstanding. This film is over forty years old, and it still looks good. And it has a great sense of imagination, always being creative with the names of the candies.However it doesn't work well as an adaptation, they were squirrels in the book, the Slugworth guy was only in a short sentence, they used a glass elevator right after veruca. The Wonka Wash didn't exist. They were allowed to bring two guests. Charlie's dad wasn't dead. And they added songs for no reason.Remember, I love this movie, it's one of my most nostalgic movies, but it isn't that great of an adaptation. If you want a closer version to the book, watch Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. But I do recommend this movie.",

Gene Wilder was perfectly cast as the candy man and is the main reason that this film is regarded as a classic. Watching it back, I was surprised at how long it took to finally meet Wonka and enter his factory - nearly 45 minutes! While the moments leading up to October 1st at 10:00am added character depth and motivation, I found myself impatiently waiting for the real adventure to begin.Once in the factory, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. As the guests meandered through the marvelous world of Wonka's chocolate factory, the absurdities became marvels and I instantly trusted in Wonka's all-knowing behavior. Even when child after child fell by the wayside, it's Wonka's careless, yet confident control of each situation that makes you forget the severity of the situation. With a strong message of the consequences of misbehaving, the real essence of this film is in the limitless possibilities of imagination. Largely driven by Wilder's charming performance, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is escapism at its finest.",

Do you ever see him admiring anyone? No and he doesn't care for anyone. Not even Charlie. He doesn't care how he acts in front of people nor what they say. He is all alone.\nThe candy is his extreme attempt to make him happy, however in the end he is not. Why do you think everything is in half in his personal office? He is not fulfilled. He does not care if he or anyone else die in the boat or the elevator. He uses everyone for his own amusement. And why shouldn't he? Noone cares about him, only for his chocolate.In the end Charlie makes a good deed. Maybe seeing himself in him, Wonka gives him his legacy. He can't give it to an adult because he is not like them. Alas he just continue to give joy to others like his candy has always done.\nThe final conversation is there only to be ambiguous.

But the unrelenting meanness of this film was too much. With the exception of the hero, the children are overly obnoxious. What are the odds that of all the winners of the contest, all but one would be among the worst a parent could raise? Julie Dawn Cole is absolutely brilliant in her role as an obnoxious debutante and the other actors do well. Also, the musical numbers are well-written and performed. But it seems as if the naughty are being set up to do bad things so that Wonka can have an excuse to see them suffer.

But I don't like fantasy as a rule, and Roald Dahl's imagination tends to creep me out severely, so there was no point in my seeing this film at any point over the past 40+ years, even though I was the target age when it first came out in theaters. But, it finally came up free on streaming and I figured what the heck, I could always turn it off.I haven't read the book or seen the Johnny Depp re-make (there's another guy who creeps me out severely), but I do like Gene Wilder, he turned in a good performance here, and he was reason enough for me to finish the whole thing. I kept forgetting it was a musical\u0085 just a handful of mostly lame, forgettable, awkwardly-inserted songs. To show you how little I knew about this film going in, I was actually surprised to find that the song \"The Candyman\" originated here. (Back to severely creepy for a moment: whoa, that Candyman guy needs to be closely watched by local law enforcement; he just oozed 'predator'!) The four grandparents in the same bed together all those years was disturbing\u0085 thanks, Mr. Dahl, for yet another grotesque image. I can only imagine what some small children might think of the chubby kid getting stuck in the chocolate pipe, the \"funhouse\" boat ride, etc., not to mention the scary-looking Oompa Loompas\u0085 heck, I'm twice their size and I wouldn't mess with 'em! Of course, any tour that starts with the signing of a waiver immediately indicates how dangerous this tour is going to be, so viewers (not to mention the characters) have been fairly warned. Who even *thought* about waivers in 1971? Almost nobody, right? And was I the only one wondering why minor children were allowed to sign this supposedly legal contract instead of their guardians?(Okay, I'm over-thinking this part, but still\u0085 that looked ridiculous.) To those who complain that it didn't follow the book: as I said, I haven't read it, so I can't agree or disagree. But I would point out that the \"Wizard of Oz\" movie wasn't especially faithful to the book either. (Thank goodness\u0085 I couldn't stand the book!) Watchable.

Obviously he's still a few years away from Mel Brooks's comedy goldmine, but no one can do what he does in this movie and sell a performance like he can. \"Pure Imagination\" is one of the all time greatest songs from this musical, and the Oompa Loompa's are parodied to death nowadays because they're so darn good.Out of all his stories, this remains my favourite of Roald Dahl's work. Though it may shy away a little from it's source material, this movie blends fantasy, adventure and dark humour perfectly.

            "content": "Fantasy sparks imagination, and in a film like \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\" that's probably a good thing, because applying any sense of logic to this story will give you a brain tumor.The film centers around a small, poor, basically-homeless boy named Charlie. In his world, there is a chocolate company named Willy Wonka (which now does exist because of this movie), owned by a mysterious man with the same name: Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder). Wonka has started a worldwide phenomenon as he states that he has put five gold tickets in candy bars around the world. When all five are found, he will invite all the ticket holders into his mysterious candy factory, and show them his wonderful world, filled with a room made completely of candy, and Umpah Lumpahs, little short orange men with green hair.But Mr. Slugworth, who owns Slugworth Candy, wants to put a stop to Wonka's newest creation: The Everlasting Gobstopper (which is now made by Willy Wonka chocolate). After each ticket is found, he visits the ticket holders and tells them who he is, and that he wants them to bring (steal) back the Everlasting Gobstopper so he can study it and beat Wonka at his own game.So as Charlie finds a gold ticket and goes to Wonka's chocolate factory with his grandfather, he is tempted to steal one of the gobstoppers, but will he do it?I didn't always like this movie very much. I always liked the scene with the edible room and the Umpah Lumpahs, but everything else seemed odd and slow-moving to a certain degree. It's like taking Lewis Carroll and putting him in a room with Gene Wilder. That's what you get out of author Rohald Dahl's book, and the same can be said for the film. It has an odd sense of reality and twisted sense of humor.For example, all the children get whisked away one by one. For being a childrens' movie, this is quite odd, because I do not often see children being taken off screen like they are dead, especially in a childrens' story. One boy gets sucked through a tube of chocolate, to go into the boiling room; one girl turns into a giant balloon, and one boy gets transported into a television and can't get back out. All interesting but nevertheless deeply strange scenes.Gene Wilder was the perfect choice for the strange Willy Wonka--he fits him like a glove. Wilder doesn't seem to appear in films much anymore, but I guess he ended on a high note. \"The Producers,\" \"Young Frankenstein,\" and \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" all on his resume, I'd say he has quite a good one. I looked at his most recent films, and in 1999 he appeared in and wrote a made-for-TV film; after that he hasn't really been in much. I guess that's because he sensed the bad films coming and wanted out before he started appearing in more TV movies.But anyway, Wilder is perfect. He seems to state the odd as if there is nothing odd about it. I love the scene where he talks about the Umpah Lumpahs and where they live, and the geography teacher in the room says, \"I'm a geography teacher, and\"--he cuts her off, saying, \"Oh, good, then you know all about the bad place? Why, the [somethings] would eat ten Umpah Loompahs a day and think nothing of it!\"His tale is odd, yet strangely entertaining.I've never really been one for tales of oddness. I like \"Alice in Wonderland,\" but even that is a bit too odd for my taste. I seem to like realistic films (well, at least films that take place in our world). I like comedies, action, drama, sci-fi--the works; but I've never been one for fantasies.But if one film has ever sparked imagination, nothing has as much as \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\"3.5/5 stars - maybe 4 -",

This film is cause for one to marvel at the Hollywood designers, tradesmen and craft people for such splendid work. That said, the story is a nice fairy tale, but with live action all the way. Gene Wilder is very good as Willy Wonka, but this entire cast performed well, down to the most obnoxious child. One especially has to like Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, and Peter Ostrum as Charlie. This was Ostrum's only movie. Not bad for a child star's single performance in a leading role. Ostrum was offered a three-film contract, but turned it down. He says that although he enjoyed acting and studied it for some time, his parents weren't stage people. Instead, he went on to earn a PhD in animal husbandry from Cornell University and practice veterinary medicine for large farm animals in outstate New York. I wonder if Paramount received any negative feedback for how it portrayed a couple of the children \u2013 namely the German boy, Augustus Gloop, and the French girl, Violet Beauregarde. I doubt that any Americans would have complained at the portrayal of the two sassy, snotty, spoiled and nasty kids. Most of us have seen a Mike Teevee and a Veruca Salt more than once. But the actors who played those parts, as well as those of their parents, were very good. One wonders, though, if it was much a stretch in a couple instances. It's interesting that none of the child actors in this film made acting their career. Only one had more than a few films. This is a fun film, although with some dark overtones for kids.",

It's one of my favorites and has meant a lot to me in my life.Definitely one of a kind, due to it's adamant surrealism, it appeals to both kids and adults.The elusive Wonka chocolate factory is holding a worldwide contest so that 5 lucky winners can finally get a glimpse inside the factory walls and win a lifetime supply of chocolate.It's supposed to take place in America, but maintains an industrial European feel. Charlie Bucket, our protagonist, lives with his mother and 4 grandparents. They're very poor, and rely on Charlie's paper route money to get by. Which is why Charlie wants, more than anything, to win this contest.Anyone who's ever known they wanted something more than anyone else in the world can relate to Charlie's childlike desire to win Wonka's contest. It may seem frivolous, but that only highlights Charlie's desperation. He can only imagine luxurious things. And that ingenuous mindset is what just may give him what he needs.The film enraptures you within the first 35 minutes, before we even get inside the magical factory. And once we're in, the film ascends to a whole new level. So full of unique ideas and concepts. Set pieces that made people depressed about the movie's fictionality long before Avatar's ever did.And Willy Wonka, himself, portrayed by Gene Wilder, is a marvel. No other man could have given us such a brilliant performance. He's sweet, he's creepy, he's sincere, and he's mischievous. Roald Dahl's original 1964 novel could be adapted for film one thousand times over, yet Wilder will always remain exclusively synonymous with the role.Oh yeah, and the music is phenomenally perfect.For being a \"flop\" from 1971, this film holds up better than most, if not all, of its contemporaries.Twizard Rating: 100",

            "review_title": "Wilder as the Wonderful Wizard Wonka ...",
            "content": "Roald Dahl's classic \"Charlie and the Chocolate factory\" has always been one of my favorite readings. I discovered the book in my high school's library, and naturally, I couldn't resist to a story with such an evocative title. And on a yummy level, I wasn't disappointed, the descriptions of the many tastes, whether the Wonka bars or other candies, had the same effect than a Kinder ad.Another aspect of the novel captivated me: the characters, from the description of the Bucket family, with the four grandparents sharing the same bed, the whole suspense built upon the five golden tickets contests and the four little brats who found the first, a whole universe was immortalized in my mind, and I got to hand it to Dahl for having imagined so many colorful characters, much more with the guts to portray kids in such a negative and provocative light. Which leads me to the factory visit and its dark undertones through the fate that awaited the four participants: the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the competitive Violet Beauregard, the capricious Veruca Salt and the TV-addict Mike Teavee. We already knew kids could be cruel but I defy anyone to find a book where children get such cruel punishments.As a kid, I could easily relate to the story and it didn't bother me much that the kids would get their comeuppance, as an adult and while I enjoyed the reading three of four times more, I realized how subtly subversive the story was, and perhaps this is the greatest compliment you can give to a children's book: finding the perfect mixture between the joy and nastiness inherent to childhood, something kids can understand, and adults too. The Oompa-Loompas are a perfect example as they clearly reflect this ambivalence: while they are exotic and peculiar enough to appeal to children's imagination and their natural craving for adventures, they're also spooky and can easily pass as a miniature and collective version of the bogeyman. Still, the book cleverly focuses on an adorable kid who sets a positive example to better highlight the other kids' flaws, but he's not a one-dimensional character either, although the two films didn't give him much depth and substance.Indeed, the choice of Mel Stuart was to focus on Willy Wonka rather than Charlie. If the choice is debatable, it shouldn't overlook how a fantastic challenge adapting \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" was, in the way it restored the magic and fairy-tale atmosphere of the chocolate factory. It was also a risky project, if ever the screenwriters were tempted, no pun intended, to sugarcoat the story. Tim Burton's adaptation probably suffered from the opposite criticism as it portrayed Wonka as a kind of creepy and too enigmatic character, but the recreation of the factory, but all the technology available in the 2000's redeemed these little imperfections. While I deplored the focus on Wonka's background and the Oedipal back-story that distracted us from the real character: Charlie or the real star: chocolate, I expected the original film to be more faithful to the book, and maybe, more politically correct.But the 1971 version was quite astonishing. Granted the effects are not as dazzling as the remake, they still work and even restore a magic that was only prevailing in Disney animated movies. But the film, in itself, is a glorious achievement in the same vein that the inevitable: \"Wizard of Oz\". The journey of Charlie and Grandpa Joe, played by a convincing Jack Albertson echoes Dorothy's adventure in Oz, the 30's had the Munchkins, the 70's the Oompa-Lommpas. The film is not flawless, the songs are not as memorable as the 1939 MGM classic, except for the unforgettable \"Candy Man\", Peter Ostrum is no Judy Garland, but \"Willy Wonka\" works a wonderful tribute to Hollywood Golden Age, surprisingly effective in 1971, at the peak of the more realistic and cynical Hollywood New wave \u0085 or maybe this 'cynicism' was already embodied by Wonka's eccentric and bizarre personality, as described in the book.Naturally, the casting of Wonka was the hit-or-miss element, any kid with innocent-looking eyes and rosy cheeks could have played Charlie, given the relatively small role he has in the film. It's a choice that was criticized by the author himself but since Wonka was the pillar of the film, the studios had to come up with the perfect actor. Personally, when I read the book, I imagined Wonka as an eccentric man, wearing bright colors and sophisticated, elegant, charming but very secret, hiding in his heart a much darker soul. When I saw Wilder, I thought in myself, now that was the Willy Wonka I imagined. Loony and funny enough to make a positive impression... soon to be contradicted during the factory tour, Depp gave away that impression from the very beginning, Wilder maintained the perfect level of mystery and carried the whole film thanks to his magnificent performance.I'm sorry to fill this review with references to the remake but it's only to highlight my appreciation of the 1971 version. I was perplex regarding some deviations from the book, the global craze surrounding the contest was an inspiration for hilarious gags, but I could have done without the floating, elevating and belching part. Speaking of that moment, there's no doubt that it's Gene Wilder's performance that elevates the film, as soon as he enters, the story truly picks up and we know we're into something that would be a delightful for our eyes, and our senses, and respecting our intelligence, as kids and adults.Now, which version I prefer? 2005 or 1971? Well, let's just say I still prefer the book.",

First of all, it's very entertaining for all ages and it has some parts which are really scary for kids like when Wonka takes his guests through a tunnel full of nightmarish images such as a chicken getting its head cut off which was actually edited out for television.Wonka is fascinating, funny and often terrifying. The look in his eyes is demented and when he screams, all hell seems to spew forth. Wonka doesn't care about what happens to the kids that get knocked off. He didn't give any warning to that boy not to drink out of the chocolate lake, but starts yelling and running at him once he starts slurping it. In all the excitement, the boy is pushed into the lake and gets sucked up a tube while the mother cries \"he'll be grounded into marshmallow.\" Wonka's response is \"That pipe doesn't lead to the marshmallow room. It leads to the fudge room.\" After the girl turns into a blueberry, he casually says \"we'll have to squeeze the juice out of her before she explodes.\" Meanwhile the father is standing right beside him looking on horrified. When one of the brats does something they're not supposed to do, Wonka gives less of a warning, each time. The last time is nothing more than a softly spoken \"No, wait. Come back.\" After the kids meet their fate, we never see them again, which is the equivalent of what? Death. At the end, Wonka says they'll all be returned back to their \"normal rotten selves\", but I don't trust that smirk. Besides, how are we to believe him if we don't see the kids ever again? He's a child killer who uses candy as bait. Sure the kids deserved it, but the idea is still twisted.Take a slasher movie like Halloween for example, where all the main characters are killed, except for one who is innocent compared with the rest. Here, it's kids instead of young adults and they all get disposed in some way or another until only Charlie is left to confront the demon Willy Wonka. What I'm saying is that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a horror movie in disguise as a children's movie. Ingenious!",

But like all of Roald Dahl's books, it has a hard edge filled with many surprises. Wilder plays the quirky Wonka as he moralizes and cruelly punishes the little brats for their negative attributes. Even Charlie begins to wonder if what has been promised him has so many conditions that it may not be worth the effort.

            "review_title": "The Best Film Ever - With Only One Redeeming Character and the Villain's Name in the Title!",
            "content": "\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" is a beloved children's classic movie with lots of nods to adult viewers, throughout. It certainly earns the eight stars I gave it, thanks in great part to the endearing musical score, composed by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. However, if we are going to be honest, and I think we should be, we need to see what's actually happening in this screenplay.My first assertion is that there is only one redeeming character in this film: Charlie Bucket, as played by young towhead, Peter Ostrum. Literally every other character with a speaking part does something that proves they are selfish, thoughtless, manipulative (or manipulatable, which might be worse), greedy or just plain rotten. You wouldn't want to be around ANY of these people for any length of time. Seriously. That's extremely rare for a film that people generally like!A quick aside. Some might argue that the Oompa-Loompas should be considered \"redeeming characters.\" The reason why they are not is because they are, essentially, a \"Greek Chorus.\" They are commenting on the actions of the characters, mostly without ever interacting with them at all.But the more crucial thing to note about this film is that the main antagonist, the \"bad guy\" of the movie is Willy Wonka, himself! I've seen commentary that has suggested the other four Golden Ticket winners, or their parents or the obvious target, Jack Albertson's Grandpa Joe deserve to share the infamy. I get it, and Grandpa Joe is, in nearly every way, the most despicable parental figure in the film for many reasons (like, laying in bed for twenty years, then suddenly being capable of a song and dance production number to the tune, \"I've Got a Golden Ticket\" -- No, Joe, YOU don't have anything! That's Charlie's ticket!) so, let me briefly explain why this dishonor belongs completely to Willy Wonka.First, Wonka has placed five Golden Tickets into his standard candy bars, offering the winners a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate. Therefore, he is making all of this happen (at an incredible profit). Second, he is a saboteur. He hired a guy to pretend to be his rival, asking the winners to steal an Everlasting Gobstopper! Third, he pretends to be disabled, just for a sight gag. Fourth, he gets everyone inside of his factory and THEN shows them an enormous contract they must sign to continue. Additionally, much of the fine print is illegible. That leads to fifth, disqualifying each winner from receiving the prize, for breaking Wonka's unreadable rules.Along the way, Wonka tempts the winners with things he knows they find irresistible (a piece of gum for Violet, a chance to be on television for Mike, etc.), never fully disclosing his intentions or goals. He used the ticket winners' interests to make them Guinea Pigs for his beta test level products, then punishes them when it all goes wrong. And he has a demonic boat!Finally, the most atrocious element is why Wonka did all of this: he was looking for a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a person whom he could train to do everything HIS way, so he could retire, knowing his replacement would robotically follow his instructions. Also Wonka was clearly not more than forty years old, and was doing a job he presumably loved. Why would or should he retire?BUT, the reason why we forgive EVERYTHING can be summed up in two words: Gene Wilder.Mr. Wilder's portrayal of the title character not only makes Wonka palatable, it makes all of his bad deeds so obscure, he's charming and loveable! That is an amazing testament to the actor and his genuine goodness and talent. Without Wilder, this movie would likely have been forgotten and certainly never would have had a real candy company founded, a film reboot, a Broadway musical and a prequel!All hail Willy Wonka. All hail the amazing Gene Wilder.",

            "content": "A wonderful story with a wonderful message: honesty cannot be bought for any price, but it is the most valuable gift that any person (child or adult) can have.This is a great film because it appeals to both kids and adults.  Roald Dahl packs his story full of all the tasty and grotesque things that children love, while the script includes enough clever jokes and quotations to keep the attention of their parents.  It is without question the finest family film ever made.The first part of the film is possibly the funniest.  Rather than seeing a group of children searching the world for Golden tickets, we are instead presented with a variety of obsessed adults who seem willing to pay any price for the prizes.  This makes the film even more enjoyable for children; they get to see their parents acting like maniacs, the way the children themselves would.But it is five children who find the tickets, and they are hand-picked to be the worst examples of bratty kids: the overfed glutton, the snotty gum-chewer, the smarmy couch potato, and of course the most demanding, spoiled little demon in history (in my opinion, one of the greatest performances by a child actor ever)But the fifth is the golden child, the hard-working, honest little boy who has never had anything.  From the beginning he's taking care of his family, trying to be the man of the house now that his father is dead.  One can't help but love Charlie, especially as he sadly walks home alone to the sounds of his mother singing him a lullaby.The point of the film is that honesty, innocence, and faith will eventually make dreams come true.  Those dreams are brought to life through the Chocolate Factory, a spectacular series of sets and scenery, along with a delightful musical score.  Yet all through the Chocolate Factory, it is only Charlie who really seems to be enjoying himself; the others only whine and complain about all the strange and wonderful things around them.I thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.  It teaches an inspiring lesson, it has many colourful characters, and the scenery is enough to make your mouth water.  It's positively scrum-diddly-umptious!",

            "content": "Roald Dahl is one of my favorite fantasy writers because what I loved about his stories was how he brought fairy tales to our modern era and existence, which to me showed that fantasy stories don't have to just be confined to the medieval era but can be in our time frame. Which also further show that in the fantasy genre anything truly is possible and anything can go. This film is another one of my favorite fantasy films of all time and it's also another childhood relic, I've seen this film when I was about seven.I really love the production value, everything is practical they successfully create a great look of the factory, the factory is sort of like the Tardis in \"Doctor Who\" it's literally a hidden world where you see all sorts of things from the Candy Land which as a kid I wanted to go to because I wanted to chomp on most of that candy. Down to the machines that look like something out of Rub Goldburg cartoons, my favorite machine is that gum machine, which is strange from what it has like crushing tomatoes and a bee hive. The writing is excellent, the dialog is just clever and at times really funny, there are so many memorable lines that it would take more than one watch to hear and get them all.Though like in Brothers Grimm fashion the film can also be kinda dark and a bit scary. From each of the life and death situations the kids stupidly get themselves into. Down to that infamous boat ride from hell scene, that scene is one of the most bizarre and scariest scene I've ever seen really scared me when I was a kid. It's like some trippy experimental film that some doped up film student cooked up as you are just seeing random nasty images.The music is great as there are plenty of memorable songs. Two of my favorites are of course Pure Imagination sung beautifully by Gene Wilder. And my second one is \"I Want it Now\", that song is just fun and really hilarious as the song is the expression of the epitome of Veruka's greed and vanity.The characters are great, really like protagonist Charlie whom is the everyday kid you've probably passed by or were. He's good natured, never selfish he's selfless as he loves his family and does his best to help them out. He's sympathetic as he really has not much to anything going for his life. I wouldn't say he's so much a kid with dreams but more like a kid whom is looking for something great in life, a chance to taste it may'be be part of it.I really like how you see a parallel contrast between him and the rest of the kids in the group. All of the other kids have been in rich or high class existences which means they had practically every advantage in life but as we see have turned out kinda rotten. Where we see Charlie he's lived on the low end of things but he turned out to be alright as he's smart and kind. It just shows that just because you grew up on the wrong side of the tracks doesn't mean a person will turn out bad; and just because someone grew up on the right side doesn't always mean they'll be good.Veruka Salt she is a kid you just love to dislike. To me she is just the absolute worst of the bunch because she is just spoiled rotten to the core. Her constant bad case of the gimmies can make you both laugh and grown at the same time. But seeing her just goes to show that giving your kid everything he or she asks for is bad parenting at best because your teaching your kid a bad lesson that they get everything handed to them. As Lincoln Hawk once said \"Life don't go one way for nobody\", Veruka is going to learn that saying the hard way.And of course my favorite character is Willy Wonka played by one of my favorite comedic actors Gene Wilder. This is my favorite role from him, he has some of the best lines ever but he just has just this great amount of energy both physically and comedically, to me Gene really is Willy Wonka. In a way he's kinda like \"Doctor Who\" as his character has this three dimensional enigmatic quality to him. At times he can be truthful but then he's not, he can also flip on his persona. There's a bit of a good back and forth between both Charlie and him, it's almost a father and son like dynamic as Willy fills in that father figure role that Charlie is sorely missing.One of my favorite moments with Willy is the cream room where it's literally both verbal and visual humor at work. As he is just saying something and then putting his play on words to practice, when he puts some random things in each cream mixture. I always wonder what else does he put into the mixtures.And of course like with most fairy tales this film has a sense of morality, there are a lot of underlying messages without being preachy or heavy handed. Like how it's OK for kids to indulge in the sweets of life but it's more important they get what they need in order to grow healthy and happy. But also about bad parenting, why we need to be better teachers for kids, teach them and give them what's more important in life, to not spoil and indulge them all the time which is practically the equivalent of giving them nothing.This fantasy is full of rich goodness.Rating: 4 stars",

Every so often a character will start singing, but this is because (a) the film falsely believes that it's a musical, and (b) it's worried that its musical guild membership will lapse if too many consecutive minutes pass without a song.  Admittedly, the Oompa-Loompa song isn't, and arguably contributes something; it would contribute more if it were the ONLY song, and thus evidence of how unusual and surreal the chocolate factory is, but since so many people sing such weak songs elsewhere in the film the effect is lost.  (And isn't \"Cheer Up, Charlie\" DIRE?)I can't believe that there are people who think this enjoyable concoction is too dark.  Too dark for children to enjoy?  Who cares.  Too dark to be any good?  You can't be serious.  It's several tones lighter than \"Citizen Kane\", itself not a particularly grim movie, so stop complaining.  We're even told that the four nasty children emerged from their ordeal unscathed, which was an aesthetic mistake - we ought to have been left in doubt, with a strong reason to believe that one or two of them had perished or at least been permanently injured.  What's the point of introducing us to the perilous side of the chocolate factory if all the perils turn out to be harmless?  When Veruca was sent down the garbage chute, we took pleasure in this because we thought there was a very real chance she would be killed - and then we felt guilty about our pleasure, so Willy Wonka tells us at the end that nothing really happened, which enables us, so the theory goes, to have our cake and eat it.One more complaint: there's a failure of surrealist imagination inside the chocolate factory.  It isn't THAT marvellous a place, and we don't really see how Willy Wonka manages to produce the best chocolate in the world - in fact, between you and me, I don't believe he does.  But this is a letdown largely because the long lead-up is so good.  It's hard to know what to make of a film so uneven.",

            "content": "Tim Burton's recent version of the classic Roald Dahl story may have been more faithful to its source material, but this 1971 musical adaptation of the much loved children's classic, directed by Mel Stuart, is still well worth watching as it manages to accurately capture the feel of the book and is a whole heap of fun.Gene Wilder plays eccentric sweet-maker Willy Wonka, who allows five children to tour his amazing factory after they find lucky golden tickets hidden in winning bars of Wonka chocolate. Of the five, only Charlie Bucket is truly deserving of such an honour and, as the tour progresses, the other children suffer from a series of bizarre mishaps.This movie is a colourful, candy coated treat with a deliciously dark comical centre. Wilder is excellent as the slightly sinister recluse who welcomes the (mostly) obnoxious children and their equally awful parents into his world. His factory is a brilliantly realised surreal wonderland and is a feast for the eyes (as well as the stomach!). The music, for the most part, is pretty memorable with standout tunes being 'I've got a golden ticket' and the Oompa Loompa songs.The wonderfully bizarre characters are all perfectly realised by the talented cast, from poor little Charlie (Peter Ostrum) to the spoilt kids (in particular, the brilliantly brattish Julie Dawn Cole as Veruca Salt) and their parents (including the great Roy Kinnear).My only gripe with the movie is when it strays too far from the original story. I'd have loved to have seen the squirrel room from the book, rather than the geese, but I guess that this was probably too hard to translate to the screen in 1971 (however, this scene does appear in the recent Burton movie). I also disliked the introduction of Slugworth and the whole everlasting gob-stopper 'test'. In the book, I always thought that the children were being tested as soon as they entered the factory, and that when they broke the rules, they had failed that test. In the book, Charlie abides by the rules and becomes the deserving winner, but in this telling, Grandpa Joe and Charlie also break Wonka's rules by stealing the lemonade. Why were they spared the kind of nasty fate suffered by the other rule-breakers? Had Wonka already made his mind up to choose Charlie at the start?If you haven't read the book (or as not as much of a purist as I am when it comes to adaptations), you will adore this film. Although not perfect, I think it is a very good movie which will appeal to adults and children alike.",

He obviously got into the spirit of the role and his interaction with the children (mostly obnoxious little brats) is commendable.The sets look luxurious although I suspect that today's use of CGI would even improve on this factor and the color photography in the WideScreen version is a rich palette of mouth watering colors.Somehow I missed seeing this film when it first opened and don't recall what the critical reception was--nor was I aware of all the hoopla regarding its status as a children's classic. Whatever, it seems to merit praise as a modestly successful musical fantasy that has enough wit and charm to make it diverting entertainment. I haven't seen the recent remake with Johnny Depp, so I'll make no comparison.Frank Albertson is especially good as Gramps and Peter Ostrum (as the only likable child in the cast) does a nice job in his only screen role. The antics of the other children are sufficiently objectionable to understand why Willy Wonka disposes of them (and their parents) the way he does. In many ways, the story serves as a cautionary tale for parents and children.The lyrics are clever and the music has a decidedly pleasant way of advancing the plot although I definitely wouldn't call it as memorable as some other children's classics I can think of.",

The fabulously self-confidant Herr Wonka is almost undone with disappointment at the poor specimens in whom he had placed his hopes.The final scene did something to this commentator now far into middle age: it made me wish I had had children.

People are cruel by nature and it's only the artificial veneer of civilization that stops them manifesting this cruelty in the worst way . Let's be honest here - the younger we are the more cruel we are since our social conditioning makes us more mellow in our older psychological state . Childhoods are a living nightmare of authoritarian adults and playground bullies and dreams are usually composed of fighting back against oppressors I read Dahl's original novelization of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY as a child and my abiding memory of it is the domestic life of young Charlie whose family is oppressed by grinding poverty . What this film version of the book does very well is juxtapose the noble poverty stricken Charlie with the hateful bourgeois philistine brats who also win a trip to the chocolate factory . One's the daughter of a rival sweet company , ones the daughter of an American politician , one's a loud dumb American kid etc . If George Orwell and Leon Trotsky lived long enough to watch this movie they'd proclaim it as a masterpiece due to the subtext The problem is the film doesn't really live up to masterpiece status due to its commercial consideration . This isn't necessarily a criticism but as so many people have stated on this page the film does suffer from rather weak musical numbers which jar with the darker aspects of the movie . There's only two musical numbers that stick in the memory The Candy Man opening number and The Oompa Loompa song and one wonders if the film might have worked better without the musical numbers ? That said the songs are kept to a minimum . Also in the film's favour is the fact that it has a \" Neverwhere \" type of location that's neither Europe or America . Imagine if this film was made a few years earlier with an conservative American-centric view of the world . Now that would have been a disaster",

Abandon all hope ye who enter this comment.WWAtCF is a reasonably good film, with weak spots, to be sure, but Gene Wilder does a great job and delivers some rather acid lines.  The script is decent, even good in spots.  Not a great movie, but not future guitar picks either.  Has more than a few moments.  Enjoyable, but has somewhat sharp teeth in spots.  End of film review.Now as to film adaptations of work done in other mediums.  Gather 'round, children, as the next few points are moderately significant:  One: a film and a book are different critters.  They have different requirements, strengths and weaknesses and some of these are almost diametrically in opposition.  Thus, an adaptation (in either direction) HAS to be different. Both can be good, bad or mediocre.  But anyone expecting them to be the SAME is mistaken, as they can't be.Two: any work that is released into the wider world and is intended for an audience has two sensibilities involved-the creator(s) and the audience. Every person reading, hearing and/or viewing anything brings themselves to the table.  You bring your own viewpoint into the equation.  Who you are has a great deal to do with how you see things.  Bear this in mind when reading anyone's opinions (including mine).  Most commentary says as much (often more) about the commentator as it does the purported subject.  In other words, you see what you largely expect to see.Now, as to Roald Dahl:  from all reports, Dahl was less than enthralled with the adaptation.  I suspect that it's because Dahl's work had teeth to it, generally speaking, and the incisors here have been blunted and softened a bit.  I read an interview a good many years ago and came away with the impression that Mr. Dahl thought much more highly of children than he did most adults, whom he viewed as incompetent at best and malign at worst, particularly most parents or surrogate parents.  The core of this runs through his work.  The hardest job anyone can have is that of parent, the entrance exam to become one is all too easy, the effects (good and bad) are far-reaching and too many people botch it up in spades.  Watch Willie Wonka again or read Dahl's book.  One other thing: when viewing, hearing or reading something, think about your reactions.  Everyone has hot buttons. It might help if you can recognize what yours are.  After all, it's only a movie, isn't it, now?",

Here's a popular film that had escaped me over the years but I finally tried it since my girlfriend was wanting me to see the remake. There's a lot to enjoy here and a lot to take in but at the end of the film I can't say I had a great time. There's certainly a lot to enjoy here but the second half of the film really left me bored to the point where I was struggling to stay awake. The greatest thing for the film is the incredible production design, which gives us all sorts of great sets with the best being the river a chocolate. The four naughty kids go through all sorts of strange tricks and gags but I didn't really find any of them funny and it didn't really give me any drama since it's rather clear how the movie is going to end. Another thing that does work are the three leads led by Ostrum who is extremely good in his role. To me Jack Albertson really steals the film as the boy's grandfather and he also gives the best musical number in the film. Wilder has become a legend since making this movie and there's no doubt that this is one of his most memorable roles. He does a great job with it and turns in a fun character but I must say I didn't think it was the best of his career.

            "content": "Gaging audience and critical reactions to cinematic adaptations by beloved children's author Roald Dahl feels somewhat like running a Goldilocks gauntlet: too sweet (The BFG), too sour (The Witches), or too Wes Anderson* (Fantastic Mr. Fox)? That said, if there's any offering that feels 'just right,' it's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Contrary to Dahl's own vitriol towards the film for its plot tweaking, it's impossible to envision a film which better captures his whimsical, contradictory, heart-melting madness. Rightly heralded as one of the most beloved kids' films of all time, Wonka proves as timeless as it is lovely, and a surprisingly tender celebration of whimsy and appreciating magnificent things. All of the best Dahl sort into either scathing satire of the misdeeds of awful adults, or dreamy love-letters to the powers of fantasy and imagination. Wonka brings the best of both in spades. Cheerfully echoing The Wizard of Oz's 'real world/fantasy escape' divide, director Mel Stuart opts for stylized zaniness in his depiction of protagonist Charlie's pre-factory life, but only to draw out the oppressive nonsensical iniquities and dullness therein. Charlie's 'real life' is beset by gawking, bedridden grandparents with matching names, or jeering, power-tripping buffoons like his science teacher. Here, the only breaks seem to come to the most atrocious Veruca Salts of the world, who belligerently bludgeon the system into working for them. Stuart's East German village setting feels perfectly stuffy and quaint but subtly picturesque throughout. Even the sole bright spot, Charlie's mother singing \"Cheer Up, Charlie,\" is muted by her quaver of deep-seated hopelessness throughout.Which, as you'd imagine, only makes Charlie's miraculous discovery of a Wonka ticket all the more infectiously rousing. Dahl's central theme here - \"If you're very, very good, good things will come to you\" - may verge on misleadingly na\u00efve populism, but it's quintessential children's movie moralism, and Peter Ostrum's Charlie is so gosh- darn adorable that you practically draw blood clenching your fists willing him to find his ticket. He's perfect casting: bright-eyed, soft-spoken, and practically vibrating with shy excitement, and even his occasionally flat acting feeds into his bashful earnestness. More importantly, rather than caving to the kind of saccharine sanctimoniousness that drenches most comparable 'good boy' performances, Ostrum plays Charlie with temperamentality and sometimes fickleness of a kid. It makes sharing his journey into the Chocolate Factory all the more intoxicating when we're able to drink in just how important it is for this adorable fellow. Wonka's eponymous factory is a key example of the film showing its age in the best possible sense. Come 2005, in the hands of Tim Burton's deliriously redundant remake, Wonka's workplace became a squelch of muddy CGI, like an overturned paint easel onto a sand castle. Here, the factory, built entirely with practical sets and props, feels euphorically tangible - half the magic of the peerless \"Pure Imagination\" sequence is watching the kids let loose on a field of tactile confections, smashing and chewing and slurping away in the most gleefully vicarious way. It's still a masterclass of set design - a kaleidoscope of colourful, almost Seussian calibre of zany inventiveness, yet uncluttered enough to drink in the richness of detail (even if the chocolate river itself looks more sickly than delicious). If anything, the only complaints are that the episodic string of wonders can start to dry up somewhat after starting with the mesmerizing spectacle of the chocolate room (by the time we arrive at the Wonkavision room, we've indisputably lost some momentum), and the surreal, curiously extraneous interlude of the psychedelic river ride is the stuff of immediate nightmares in an otherwise thoroughly kids-friendly film. Otherwise, Dahl's vicious sense of humour slathering on a vicious moral code by systematically pushing the delightfully awful kids for their transgressions, punctuated by delightfully admonishing Oompa Loompa musical numbers, sustains the magic, but perfectly grounds it from becoming too frilly. And fear not - there's always the subtlest of details - a musical lock here, an edible teacup there - to keep the imagination pure. Still, there's no denying that Gene Wilder is the almost singlehanded reason the movie has reached such timeless, beloved status. From his unforgettable hobbling-turned- tumbling entrance onwards, Wilder's Wonka is such a painstakingly realized rendition of an eccentric genius, that it's almost palpable how engrossing it is watching him, knowing how quickly he can turn on a dime from dreamy to apoplectic. Lilting, light- as-a-feather physicality aside, Wilder does more with a twitch of his eyes and slight break in his voice when reciting any number of calculatedly nonsensical magpied quotations than other actors could do with a soliloquy. Watching him nearly tear up as he shyly fawns over how much he hopes the children enjoy the factory, to later murmuring \"No. Please. Stop.\" with side-splitting indifference as the children successively succumb to temptation and horrible consequences, Wilder's perfect cocktail of offbeat hilarity has never been put to better use, while the subtle touches of mad genius he sprinkles in throughout make it the performance of a lifetime. Supporting him, Jack Albertson's Grandpa Joe heralds the perfect dose of rustic belligerence and galvanizing gumption, while Julie Dawn Cole, Denise Nickerson, Paris Themmen, and Michael Bollner are all deliciously awful, and one of the strongest ensembles of child actors ever seen. The occasional pacing flub and a somewhat jarringly jubilant resolution are but the slightest drops, but they do little to affect the overall scrumdiddlyumptious aftertaste. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is beautiful, wistful, wacky, snarky, one of the best escapist children's parables outside of Harry Potter, and debatably the best cinematic Dahl to date. Want to change your world? As Wonka croons, \"there's nothing to it.\" RIP Mr. Wilder, and thanks for the smiles. -9.5/10 *I lied. Obviously, I love Wes Anderson and Fantastic Mr. Fox.

Basically, a chocolate factory in the town Charlie Bucket(introducing Peter Ostrum) lives is sending out millions of chocolate bars worldwide, five of them contain golden tickets for a trip to the factory, and a lifetime supply of chocolate. One by one the tickets are found, and eventually, Charlie gets his. This ticket takes them into the magical world of the highly imaginative and bizarre chocolate factory, with the great eccentric Willy Wonka (Golden Globe nominated Gene Wilder). Obviously all the nasty kids go one by one. Fat and greedy German Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) up the chocolate tube, gum chewing Violet Beauregard (Denise Nickerson) turns into a blueberry, spoilt rich bitch Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole) falls down the bad golden egg shoot for being a bad (not the original idea in the book) and telly loving Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) is shrunk by the Wonka Vision laser. A slightly more accurate (to the book) remake by Tim Burton was made in 2005, with the original title of course. This version was nominated for the Oscar for Best Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Music for Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley and Walter Scharf. It was number 16 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!",

            "content": "Looking for a fun film for all the family with nice song? Then this is a good choice. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is based on the Roald Dahl children's story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The basic story is Willy Wonka has placed five Golden Ticket in his chocolate bars and five lucky children will get a free tour and a life time's supply of chocolate. Charlie is a poor English boy who lived in a small house with his mum and grandparents. He is also a very unselfish child who works as a paper boy and uses his money to help his family. Charlie also wants to be one of the children who get one of the golden tickets. Charlie gets lucky and finds one of the tickets and get to go to the factory. The four other children who find tickets are Augustus Gloop, a very greedy German child, Veruca Salt, a very solid English child, Violet Beauregarde, a self-obsessed American and Mike Teavee a TV-obsessed American child. When all the characters get to the Chocolate factory they find a surreal place which offers the children everything they could want, but one by one all of them get weeded out because of their selfishness. The whole point of Willy Wonka is that it's a morality tale about being good and avoid being selfish.This film has some nice little songs; the ones that I think our best are 'A World of Pure Imagination' and 'I Want it Now'. I feel that the mood is just right and go for children of all ages. It is more lighter then the Tim Burton version which I think is better. The Oompa-Loompa are also great in the film and you can't help by like them. They have been parodied in a number of times, including in the Simpsons, Futurama and Family Guy. I think that they are a lot better in this version then the Burton version. Gene Wilder was also perfectly casted as Willy Wonka, getting the role just right and I think his version is better then Johnny Deep's.All in all Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a nice little film for all the family which shows it classes by being parodied. This film is better then remake.",

            "review_title": "A fantastical children's classic!",
            "content": "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was the first feature length film adapted from one of Roald Dahl's books. Since it's release in 1971, it's become a cult classic, and is widely appreciated by children and adults alike.It is also a film I've studied in great detail. Observed from every angle. I'm not really sure why. It's almost as if there' a mystery at the heart of it I want to crack. Why is it so popular? Why does it seem so effortlessly enjoyable? Roald Dahl officially hated the film when it was finished. He thought it strayed too far from the book and was not menacing enough. Personally I disagree. I think it recaptures perfectly what made the book so engaging. Granted it didn't need to alter the title, but it's still a fantastic yarn and continues to entertain even today.The film made the wise choice of properly introducing the character of Willy Wonka at least 40 minutes in. Which is also when we see the Chocolate Factory itself. It builds the anticipation steadily. Beforehand, we meet the plucky young Charlie (Peter Ostrum), and the rest of his obnoxious companions who all gradually find the five Golden Tickets.There are quite a few people who think Willy Wonka is slow to start. I've never felt that way. I enjoy every scene before we get to the factory. There are some marvellously funny sequences, such as Charlie's pompous schoolteacher, Veruca's hilarious petulance, and the reactions of people going mad searching for the Golden Tickets. There is a hidden subtext here about the greed that overwhelms people, and Charlie gets a Ticket without really looking. Because he truly deserves one, where these other people don't.The film also benefits from excellent direction from Mel Stuart. We meet each one of the horrible children in brief vignettes, and we already learn enough about them to side with Charlie, and pray they'll get what they deserve. The one major difference between the film and the book is an added subplot concerning the Everlasting Gobstopper. A rival of Wonka's, Slugworth, approaches each one of the children, and offers large sums of money in exchange for the secret recipe. I thought this was a nice touch because it adds a little ambiguity to Charlie's character, and is a departure from his squeaky clean image in the book.It's at this point we meet the person everyone has been dying to see. Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder was an interesting choice, and proves to be a total revelation. Wilder is not always one of the easiest actors in the world to watch, because of his annoying habit of screaming things out endlessly. But from his memorable first appearance walking slowly with a limp to doing a somersault, his dynamic energy is instantly engaging because it's so carefully precise. And when he does go over the top, it's entirely in character. Willy Wonka still remains Gene Wilder's finest hour.In regards to the chocolate factory, I still believe it's an astonishing array of colourful dimensions, bizarre confections and beautiful sights. There's everything here from chocolate waterfalls, candy striped meadows and sweet inventing rooms. All populated by the Oompa-Loopas, little dwarfs who carefully maintain the factory.Underneath the sugary sweet veneer, there is an undeniably sinister aftertaste. Each one of the kids disappears through their own selfishness and greed, and in another departure from the book, where we saw them at the end, here we don't. We never do find out what happens to them, especially with oblique references from Wonka such as boilers, furnaces, taffy pullers and juicers. Wonka is hilariously unconcerned with their dilemmas, which gives the film considerable kick as a cautionary tale without ever becoming too preachy.Despite the bizarre fates that befall them, this is undeniably Wonka's show all the way. He is completely in control, and it's always a wonder listening to him come out with philosophies, tactics for boosting his products, and half-hearted warnings. With a chocolate coloured hat, chocolate wrapper coloured coat, a twinkle in his eye and a spring in his step, Wilder turns Wonka into a fully rounded character who keeps the audience captive. He's also got a fine singing voice to boot.As events draw to a close, it's quite shocking when Charlie nearly loses out on the grand prize through a careless mistake. Naturally he convinces Wonka of his worth, but the fact that he nearly didn't only shows how ambiguous Wonka is. It all ends nicely in the Wonkavator, with Charlie inheriting the empire, and ensuring a new life for his poverty-stricken family.Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory still remains the best of the Roald Dahl screen interpretations, and is a template of the perfect children's film. One that appeals to the child in all of us, but still touches base with the adult so it never becomes patronising. Tim Burton's remake was a respectful incarnation, and succeeds on it's own merits, but the original still resonates with audiences as the classic it has become, and deserves to be.",

When an independent theater offered it as a midnight movie, I jumped at the chance to see it again, as did half the population of Milwaukee apparently, based on the crowd.  What resulted was an unbelievably delightful experience that was three parts film, one part audience.  To experience this film as an adult is amazing \u0096 it is one of the oddest, darkly humorous and surreal films that I can remember outside of the Jon Waters genre.  Gene Wilder is nothing short of brilliant as Willy Wonka and garnered many laughs from the audience with his partly over the top and partly wry performance.  The entire production is completely surreal from the Oompa Loompas to the unreal boat ride through the horrific tunnel. (This was a children's movie??)  I sense that this film is a `children's film' in the same sense that The Simpsons is a `children's show'.  Both have elements that would make them appealing to kids, but the reality is that adults will have more understanding of them and therefore are the target audience.  Seeing this film again really makes me excited to see what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are going to do with their remake \u0096 I think it is going to be extremely positive.--Shelly",

            "content": "Mel Stuart's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (in which the novel was really called Charlie and the chocolate factory) is arguably one of the greatest family movies ever made along with the Harry Potter franchise, Lord of the Rings trilogy, Bedtime Stories (2008),Home Alone, (1990), A Christmas Story, It's a Wonderful Life, and some of John Hughes' greatest films, as well as Matilda (which was based on a Roald Dahl novel). Some people who may have seen at least one of the film adaptations of Roald Dahl's novels do not get why he treasured children's stories very much, and I was very curious myself without even thinking about it until I saw the film adaptation of Matilda (1996) which was directed by Danny DeVito got my questions answered, and that answer was that not only children can be entertained by his work but teenagers and adults as well. But while I was watching this film which also happened to be based on a Roald Dahl novel made me love the magic of kids movies a lot more than I have before, the film tells the story of an poor boy named Charlie (played by Peter Ostrum) who after school works as a paperboy in order to support his family mortgage, and gets involved in a golden ticket contest for five people and each of the winners gets to bring one family member as well as Willy Wonka (played by Gene Wilder)himself. After everyone around the globe finds out about the contest it ends up to be a race against time to see who five people really are going to be and we find out about each one approximately a few minutes apart from one another (though I won't get too in depth with the film's story). the film is also an excellent way of getting to know Charlie who was the last of the 5 winners in the contest and after all of the five winners were confirmed Charlie brings his grandfather (played by Academy Award winner Jack Albertson), the film also has an excellent supporting cast which includes Julie Dawn Cole as the spoiled brat Veruca Salt, Roy Kinnear as Veruca's Alfred Pennyworth type father who follows every father's philosophy in order to make their own lives as well as their children's lives a whole lot easier is to be happier all the time and he does in the most feminine type of way, Denise Nickerson as Violet who is a huge gum chewer and ironically ends up being one of the contest winners even though she doesn't really eat chocolate, Leonard Stone in a great father like performance as Violet's father (and obviously he is much more manly than Veruca's father), Michael Ollner as the very disobedient and overweight Augustus Gloop, and Ursula Reit as Augustus's mother. Another thing that I noticed while watching this film was that it blends the two genres of both comedy and musical together of which that to me was really neat. This movie is a film that is committed to it's story, characters, and humor that Roald Dahl put into his 1964 novel, this is one of the best movies of 1971 as well as one of the best movies of the 1970s.",

This is the movie adaptation of one of his stories, very much in the mold of an \"Alice in Wonderland\", the protagonist being a child and all the candor he manifests, and this film is further testament to the 'Peter Pan' myth that within us lives forever a child, full of a purity and enthusiasm that never die. Willy Wonka is superbly interpreted by Gene Wilder here, and it should be said all the children actors play their roles very well too. Especially, I thought, the little Veruca Salt. The song scenes are very good, the Oompa Loompa song being an absolute cinema classic that'll ring in people's heads til they die. The dialog is excellent, every Wonka line being somehow symbolic or having double meaning. Overall this film is an ode to humanity, principle, but also to the strange: don't be afraid to show your difference, even if it scares some. The boat scene for example, a metaphor of the stranger dimension of eccentric experimentation. Excellent watch.",

            "content": "\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" was only a modest success at the time of its release but it has since gained cult status through years of TV broadcasts and home video sales. Tim Burton's 2005 remake (titled \"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory\", like the book) revisited the source material but I feel that the 1971 adaptation is still the best.Roald Dahl adapted his own novel here and the script also received uncredited work by David Seltzer (best known for \"The Omen\"). The resulting product is highly imaginative and also shows a slight touch of the darker side of the screenwriters. As a result, the story has the distinct feel of a cautionary tale.The acting is generally good. Gene Wilder gave what is by far the film's best performance in his role as eccentric candy-maker Willy Wonka. Past Oscar winner Jack Albertson lent the film some further credibility. The children's performances are generally good, with some better than others. The remainder of the supporting cast is made up of unfamiliar faces who nevertheless perform admirably.The direction by Mel Stuart isn't particularly impressive but the colourful production design makes up for any deficiencies there. Some of the special effects are a bit crude by today's standards but they get the job done. The film's original songs are all memorable, save for \"Cheer Up, Charlie\", which I suspect few would miss. The film's score was deservedly nominated for an Oscar (the film's only nomination).In my opinion, \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" is a family film that holds appeal for old and young alike. Wilder's Wonka is iconic and the story's deft use of 'pure imagination' makes for an enjoyable ride.",

I still remember the rather horrifying image of Augustus, as he is sucked up the pipe, being shown repeatedly, during commercials for the film.  When,  saw it at Thanksgiving on tv it was even worse.  Between the Ooma-Loompa's and the boat ride, I had more than enough fuel for my nightmares.  But, I still loved the film.Hollywood is too afraid to make movies like this anymore.  Disney used to delight in scaring the beejezus out of you with their villains.  Now everything has to be cute and sappy.  Roald Dahl wrote books that children loved.  Why?  Because he understood that kids like to be scared.  It helps them deal with their fears.  Now we get films about basketball playing dogs and endless Olsen twins.SPOILERS-This is a great morality tale of a young, honest boy who does what he is supposed to, even when everyone else doesn't.  Charlie lives in the real world.  Oh, sure, it doesn't quite look like our world, but it's a world that isn't fair.  Charlie is good and kind in a cold and harsh world. He doesn't get rewarded for his good behavior; until one day.Charlie is given a chance at wonderment and to make his family life easier, if he betrays the man who gives him his chance to enter a world of pure imagination.  Charlie has the most to gain; but, he stays true to himself and Willie Wonka.  Finally, he gets his just reward.Peter Ostrum, in his only film role, shows tremendous talent and potential; but, he decided it wasn't for him and walked away.  He had people offering him another golden ticket, but once was enough.  You have to admire that kind of conviction in one so young.The cast is filled with great performances, from great character actors. Jack Albertson is a treasure as Grandpa Joe and Gene Wilder is not to be trusted.If you get the chance, see it on DVD with the commentary from the former cast of children.  There's some interesting stuff there: like the fact that the two girls both had crushes on Peter Ostrum, and traded off being his girlfriend.  And fans of \"The Prisoner\", watch the Oompa-Loompas carefully; you may just see a certain butler.There has been talk of remaking this film, which makes one wonder why?

It's just as funny and partly scary as I'd remembered it watching as a pre-teen on TV during the mid-'70s. Wilder himself was funny, a little scary, and warm enough that you couldn't help but love him despite all he was subjecting his visitors through at Wonka's candy factory. Of the child players, Julie Dawn Cole was the funniest as the bratty Veruca Salt especially when she was the only one to have a solo musical number just before her fate. No wonder she was the only one of them to continue acting as she grew up. And seeing this in the theatre, I finally watched the \"Cheer Up, Charlie\" number in its entirety after some of my siblings fast-forwarded through it when watching it on VHS tape. It's not a bad number but it did slow the film down somewhat.

And the first time you watch it you don't think about it... but it's a really thin line he had to walk to come across as not creepy and still be eccentric and fun and he pulled it off in spades.I didn't really think about it as a kid, but as an adult (especially with Burton's) it's one of those things where Wilder should have won an Oscar. It was Academy Award worthy and the film was made in '71 where the Academy Awards still meant something.Gene's devastatingly on target performance aside, this is just a fun film that the family deserves to see and it certainly needs to be lauded over the remake.",

            "content": "This is the first of two big motion picture adaptations of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", one of Roald Dahl's popular children's books. I first saw it during my later childhood years in the late 90's, which was also when I read the book. This was before the second adaptation was made. I went to see that version on the big screen, and by then, it had been years since I had last seen this one, so I didn't know how they compared. It's been a few years since the release of that remake, and I don't think I've seen it since 2006, the year after its theatrical run, but I have finally seen the original \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" for the first time in probably over a decade. I still remembered it clearly, and was well aware of its reputation as a classic family movie, so I was expecting it to be great, and was not disappointed! Charlie Bucket is a poor young boy who lives in a shabby old house with his mother and four bedridden grandparents. His father has passed away. Charlie loves chocolate, but since his family is so poor, he doesn't get to eat it very often. There is a mysterious chocolate factory nearby, owned by a mysterious man named Willy Wonka, where very popular candy comes from. One day, it is announced that the factory owner has sent out five golden tickets, each of which could be found inside any Wonka bar wrapper anywhere in the world! Anyone who gets one of these tickets will win a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate! The first four ticket finders are a German glutton named Augustus Gloop, a dreadfully spoiled English girl named Veruca Salt, an obsessive American gum chewer named Violet Beauregarde, and an American television addict named Mike Teevee. It seems all hope for Charlie getting one of these tickets is lost when news spreads that the fifth one has been found in Paraguay, but this turns out to be a fraud, and just after the boy learns that, he opens the wrapper of a Wonka bar he has purchased with money he found, and inside, finds the last golden ticket! However, on his way home to tell his family the good news, he is stopped by a sinister-looking man who says his name is Arthur Slugworth, the owner of a rival candy company who wants Charlie to bring him a sample of Wonka's Everlasting Gobstopper!I wasn't sure how entertaining it looked like this film was going to turn out to be right at the beginning, with the opening credits showing the process of chocolate making, and then showing a shopkeeper singing \"The Candy Man Can\" to kids in his candy shop, though this part certainly isn't bad. However, it quickly became very intriguing to me as we see Charlie's loving family for the first time, and basically stayed this way for the rest of the film! Maybe not every scene is that great, but most of them are, and it's a great story with well-crafted characters, including Charlie. They found a good child actor to play him, even though Peter Ostrum never appeared in any other films. Grandpa Joe is another one of these characters, played wonderfully here by Jack Albertson. These are both very likable characters, and their bond helps keep the film steady. The other four main child actors all do a good job as well, playing the poorly behaved kids. Gene Wilder's charming and often humorous portrayal of Willy Wonka is another highlight, and I think it's easy to agree with that! The filming locations in Munich, Germany and the sets made for the chocolate factory scenes are also elements that help make the movie so good. As a musical, the film doesn't overdo it with the songs, which are generally very good songs, even if they're not all equally great.Next year will mark forty years since the original release of this very famous \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" adaptation. And yet, it's still a very popular family movie now, which it certainly deserves to be! Many describe \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" as timeless, and I have to agree with that. Roald Dahl wrote the classic 1964 children's novel AND wrote the screenplay for this 1971 film adaptation, and he certainly did a great job helping to bring one of his imaginative stories to the screen! Director Mel Stuart, the very talented cast, and the rest of the crew obviously helped as well. There's really not much else I can say about this classic family film, and there's probably not a lot I've said about it which nobody else has at some point during the past 39 years. That would likely be the case with any classic movie like this. It's one of those films that can appeal to kids and adults alike, generation after generation!",

Gene Wilder portrays the mysterious Willy Wonka whose chocolate factory concealed five gold tickets within billions of candy bars. Those lucky winners receive a tour of the factory. Peter Ostrum plays young and ambitious Charlie Bucket who has a great family life, particularly with Grandpa Joe, played by Jack Albertson. When all seems lost and hopeless Charlie ends up with the final ticket and offers Grandpa Joe to be his escort. The factory is an imaginary sight to one's mind. Rivers of chocolate, bubbles floating about, gummie bears hanging from trees. It is delicious until the rules are broken and that is where the lesson stems. Director Mel Stuart excites the imagination with this colorful presentation but perhaps it could be interpreted as a tad harsh. The four other children are naughty and are met with consequences when they disobey. One kid falls into the chocolate river. One girl chews forbidden gum and balloons up and turns blue. Julie Dawn Cole plays a demanding spoiled girl whose pursuit of a golden egg renders her a bad egg. Theme regards truth, heart and the sweet tooth of family and the generations to come.

Good performances by all, though has moments of cruelty and harshness(the fates of the other four children, and Wonka's \"tirade\" near the end) that are most jarring.

I have read several people critique this movie for being scary and showing kids getting hurt, but don't forget, those were nasty little monsters who got their \"just desserts.\" Did you ever notice that Wonka knew specifically where to find traps for these kids. I especially got to feel for Veruca Salt [more the actress Julie Dawn Cole than the role]; I had such a crush on her when I was a kid because she was so cute. Today, I bet she's got to look like Emma Samms. Nowadays, the movie is less of a kid's flick to me and more of a satire on commercialism and consumerism. There are several other idiosyncrasies in this plot: How did Slugworth know where to find the kids that would get the tickets ahead of time ? He's already on the scene just as Charlie and Veruca get theirs, did he set them up? If Mike Teavee watches as much TV as he seems, how did he manage to get a ticket in the first place ? Why didn't at least one adult not get one ticket when they could have refused to give their kids their allowances ?How did the computer programmer program his computer by just punching the same two buttons over and over ad infinitum ? And why are several of the back characters and the Oompahs not identified in the credits ?  Still, this is one chocolate factory I'd love to visit, but for a chance to enter the candyland room.

            "content": "When I was 9 and 10, my favourite author was Roald Dahl and my favourite book of his was 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', which was a good enough reason to see this film. My sister and I watched this film at a male friend's house when we were children, which his parents had taped, and we enjoyed it, albeit having parts from the book that were missing (I slightly prefer the 2005 remake because it is more faithful to the book and is more substantial if darker). I still remember calling out, \"Come on Charlie! Will he get the last golden ticket?' just before he finds it when I first saw this film. Fairly recently I picked up the DVD of this Film from B&M Bargains in Newport, South Wales, for \u00a32.99 while I stayed with my family since it was the only bargain DVD in the shop that appealed to me.The best aspects of this film are the charming and nostalgic musical score, most of the songs being memorable apart from 'Imagination,' despite the end credits rendition of it being harmonious and the dialogue that sticks in my mind and had wit and intelligence in certain parts. Most of the factory's interior is vibrantly coloured but a couple of its visuals are odd such as the chocolate river looking more like muddy water and the everlasting gobstoppers not being round (even the Nostalgia Critic pointed out similar flaws to these when comparing this version to the remake). Further to the songs, the best ones are the jolly 'Candyman,' the beautiful 'Cheer Up, Charlie,' the triumphant, 'I've Got a Golden Ticket,' the weird song Wonka sings during the darkest part of the film (the infamous boat ride), the repetitive yet catchy Oompa Loompa songs and the mesmerising 'I Want It Now!' I also liked the uses of scanimation, possibly during the boat ride scene and the lyrics on screen to the third Oompa Loompa number about spoilt brat Veruca Salt. Like the book, the five golden ticket winners have distinct personalities. Augustus Gloop is greedy, Violet is a talkative show-off, Mike is a comically insulting telly addict and Charlie is ambitious. As for the pace, it was rather swift in spite of a couple of the scenes before the factory being a bit boring and I found the ending a tad rushed and felt that there could have been more to it. Another reason I prefer the remake is because you see the children again after their factory disasters as per the book but here once Augustus got sucked up a pipe, Violet turned into a giant blueberry, Veruca fell down the garbage chute and Mike shrunk, you never see them again once the Oompa Loompas attend to them for treatment. I must say that this film has the better Wonka and Oompa Loompas than the remake, whereas the remake has better visuals and the best story due to its faithfulness to the book.Overall this is a delightful trip down memory lane in spite of certain parts being different from the book. 8/10.",

As a kid my parents would never let us watch past the boat/tunnel sequence which is, admittedly, quite bizarre.Some of the melodies are OK, but the lyrical choices and the way words are metered is really heinous. Your ears will cry out in pain.

The acting is great, and the caricatured characters and \"moral lessons\" very amusing. The use of vibrant colors within the Wonka factory creates a true fantasy land contrasting with the drab surrounding city. And of course there's the nice Dickensian Charlie character...Not sure what to say about the Oompa Loompas. One might consider the use of them in the factory as morally dubious. Are they not slaves? Willy Wonka explains that he has saved them from the depredation rampant in their homeland, where they are in constant danger by wild animals (or something along those lines). So it's supposed to be okay for them to live 24/7 at the factory and work day in and and day out. Question: couldn't they also lead normal lives in the city itself, where none of their natural predators live? At least I did not see any of them running around... For heaven's sake, self-styled moral sage Wonka does not need to keep them trapped at the factory! How would these orange-skinned dwarfs fare amidst ordinary human beings? Unclear.Given the undeniable quality of this movie, I have to ask: why was it remade, when the original version was so good and seems just as modern today? Of course, that's a question I always ask about misguided attempts to create \"improved\" versions of already classic films. Could it be a sign of megalomania on the part of the later director and cast?",

How many children won't love a movie that transports them into a magical chocolate factory, and how many adults won't be able to relate to the spoiled rotten kids who are at the heart of the story. So, it works. It's an enjoyable watch. Surprisingly, it holds up pretty well against modern movies, and against the Tim Burton version of the story that came out a few years ago. Sure, it lacks the CGI effects that are now ubiquitous in movie-making, but that's kind of a relief. Let's be honest - who really needs CGI? And, it has Gene Wilder who catches the quirkiness of Willie Wonka well. And the character of Charlie is a likable character, unlike the other 4 obnoxious brats who win the trip to the chocolate factory. So, it works. It can't disappoint.That isn't to say that it's perfect by any means. The story seems a bit long; the opening especially. Let's be honest. All we really care about is the trip to the chocolate factory. Sure, it was nice to learn a bit about Charlie's family. That really makes the contrast with the other 4 kids more powerful. But the search for the golden tickets was too drawn out and went on for too long. One of Willie Wonka's repeated lines is \"there's so much time and so little to do.\" That seemed appropriate, and the extended search for the ticket started to seem like filler after a while. Even the music was lacking. \"Candy Man\" is a great song, but the actor playing the shopkeeper didn't seem to put much feeling into it. It was a mechanical performance to me; not one that made an impact on me. None of the other songs or singers stood out to me, although I was surprised to see Jack Albertson, who played Charlie's Grampa Joe, singing and dancing. I also wasn't really taken with the Oopaloompas. I didn't find them very interesting.So, it's not perfect - but it's not bad either. It's fine as a family film. Enough to charm the children and enough to keep the adults interested, but it didn't have anything to really capture me and hold me riveted. It was a movie that allowed my mind to wander now and then without leaving me feeling as if I missed very much. (6/10)",

What strikes me reviewing \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,\" however, isn't so much its imaginative indelibility, but rather how playfully--even duplicitously--parodic it is. Charlie's life is a joke on \"Oliver Twist\"--a childish notion of poverty, with Charlie being the literal bread winner, when he brings a loaf home to add a more substantial meal to their usual cabbage soup, for a family that includes four grandparents all bedridden to the same bed the past twenty years. The other golden-ticket winners, too, reflect a world controlled by children. Consequently, the most important things in life become candy, gum and TV, and success comes from wanting and demanding things more. Likewise, we see a chocolate factory as a child might imagine it. It's a world of confusion and nonsense, alternately whimsical and menacing, that revolves around sugar and the boob tube. And, I suggest the parody is duplicitous, because this very film is akin to a sugar high--a piece of appealing-looking confection that's ultimately quite saccharine and owes much of its success to appearances on television (or, nowadays, streaming, as I viewed this on Netflix, with the option to munch on snacks infused with corn syrup... boy, how things have hardly changed).Although quite amusing at times--the repetitive coverage by the news anchors is especially so methinks (as one of them states in between their obsession with the golden tickets, \"We must remember there are many more important things--many more important things. Offhand, I can't think of what they are, but I'm sure there must be something.), I don't think there's much more to it than that. None of it has the bite of satire. It isn't as clever as Lewis Carroll. Even the somewhat reflexive business with TV and \"Wonka-Vision\" or the tunnel sequence avoids a reading of any commentary even at level of \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) on theatrically-released films such as this one. Moreover, while the film, fortunately, changed the book's original Pygmies to the fictional race of Oompa Loompas, an orange-faced cousin of Oz's Munchkins, it would seem, the film remains largely ethnocentric, including Western Europeans and Americans with their golden tickets that racial others may only hope to counterfeit. (At least, this version excised the episode--retained in Tim Burton's 2005 iteration--of the stereotypical Indian prince and his chocolate palace.) Indeed, some of the songs are catchy, it's quirky and fun, and Gene Wilder steals the show as the trickster Wizard to the Oz of his factory, despite not appearing until over 40 minutes in. In other words, it's candy: Wonka-Vision, which, in small doses at least, can be attractive and appealing.",

Nevertheless, my objective opinion is that the first half (prior to Wonker's appearance) is the better piece of film making, but the second half contains the major star turn from the great Gene Wilder.Even though the first half is essentially one joke that keeps getting bigger and bigger with every scene, it made me want to see if Charlie's wish came true and also intrigued me to see the factory. The build up it gives to the long awaited first appearance of the title character is quite effective.The scenes in the factory are all about Wilder, who gives a typical wild-eyed, surreal performance. He has countless memorable lines that other reviewers quote off the top of their heads and he delivers them in a way that only he can. If you haven't seen it before, simply look at his eyes and the expressions on his face as he speaks. He has a rather calm madness that lurks beneath the surface and you feel it about to burst out at any moment.It all ends with an excellent reveal and a superb exchange between Wilder and Jack Albertson that for me was worth the wait.Call me a killjoy if you like, but I thought some of the child actors were quite poor by Hollywood standards. I personally found the musical numbers to be hit and miss. Some of the production design could have been a lot better when you consider how imaginative something like Wizard of Oz was back in 1939. The tunnel sequence in the chocolate river boat has aged badly. It's really a shame I never saw it as a child because I probably would have disregarded many of the above wearing nostalgic, rose tinted glasses and given it 10/10.Overall though I imagine when it was released it probably captured the imagination of children. My four year old daughter sat through it recently looking pretty captivated by it all, so that is definite plus point for me.",

It's strongly appealing because of all the lusciousness packed inside this new digitally remastered movie candy. Eye candy, that is! Children will love its timeless tasty goodness. Imagine when you were a kid begging for Mommy to get you a Snickers bar! Just think of how your little children will beg mercy for you after one viewing! The way the children are punished seems strange for those who liked to enjoy going on a delightful journey into the sugary unknown. I guess it means \"that's life!\". Probably the most amazing, yet odd fantasy movie I've watched, but it sure tastes good! The DVD version would be much more tasty....and more fattening!!!",

What happened to those children scared me and grossed me out. None of the children deserved what happened to them. Big deal they were greedy when it came to candy, like all children. They DID NOT deserve to blow up or get stuck in a pipe full of chocolate. That's just gross. It took me many years till I would watch this movie again. Last week I watched this movie for the second time on HBO. It wasn't as bad as I remembered but I still believe Willy Wonka hates children. The Oompa Loompas are another story. They're just plain scary looking. They belong in a horror film or as Halloween decorations or something.The only thing I liked about this movie were: the big candy (that was cool), the songs, the chocolate river, and little Mike (because he was really cute). I'm glad Charlie won the factory because he was poor.I give this movie 6/10 stars.",

Forget the images that come with the movie, your imagination conjures up visions way beyond the limits of any special effects!But still, not a bad version of the book. The actors are all adequate, but Gene Wilder is fantastic, the best thing about the movie - he was the only aspect in the movie which was at least as good as what I envisioned while reading the book, if not better. And watch out for the twinkle in his his eyes! :) This is also one of those movies where knowing the story beforehand doesn't really do much damage when you actually watch it, if anything you anticipate what happens. Really the only thing to criticize - is that the movie isn't as good as our own imaginations. The other criticisms just make me laugh. Granted the special effects aren't that cutting-edge, but hey, this was made years ago and it's OK considering! Also I don't really feel it's too 'scary' for kids... I know lots of children who think that Roald Dahl's stuff are cool, and no, they don't grow up to become mass murderers. And true, there is a dark side to it, but it's got a good message to send. If anyone got traumatized, they probably grew up like a glass bubble. I'm not a kid anymore and I do still know how to enjoy it, perhaps it's even more amusing because you really get to appreciate the intelligence of the absurdity and the fun of the exaggerations that Dahl inevitably dishes out. It's silly, but perhaps that's why you love it. Another thing ... really interesting to watch out for if you're familiar with the great works of Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde etc ... I haven't read all, but enough to catch some of the quotes from their works deliciously sneaked into the dialogue here. For example, \"Parting is such a sweet sorrow\" from Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare, and \"The suspense is terrible. I hope it lasts\" from The Importance of Being Earnest by Wilde, among others.\nI especially love one of the last lines in the movie where Dahl shows his total ability for sweet innocence (and Wilder delivers it to perfection) when Wonka tells Charlie, \"And Charlie: don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he'd ever wished for.\" and Charlie asks, \"What happened?\" and this is when you're sure that he's gonna give you one of those righteous, cautionary, adult message of the preachy kind when he says, magically, \"He lived happily ever after.\" *sigh* ...",

            "content": "In my younger years, I was one of the millions of children who would settle down in front of the television on a quiet Saturday evening and descend into the magical world of Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory. Not since 'The Wizard of Oz (1939)' has a film so perfectly captured the imaginations of adults and children alike, and I know I'm not the only one to have dreamed of visiting this world of edible landscapes, wacky contraptions and surprises around every corner. Tonight I watched 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971)' for the first time in a number of years, and I found it even better than I had remembered. Despite having seen the film more than a few times, I was once again drawn into its colourful world of sugary imagination; it was as though I was seeing it again for the first time. This is the mark of a true family classic.Young Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) is the film's main protagonist, an honest and hand-working boy from a poverty-stricken family. Whereas other children are waste their money buying chocolates, Charlie dedicates his meager newspaper-delivery wages towards providing bread for his overworked mother (Diana Sowle) and four bed-ridden grandparents. However, one day there is an announcement that sends the world population into a frenzy: the reclusive but brilliant chocolate-maker Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) has hidden golden tickets in five bars of his product, and the lucky winners will be treated to a tour of his magical factory, as well as the grand prize of a lifetime's supply of chocolate! One by one, the tickets are discovered by a selection of disagreeable children, but the fifth winner may well be the most deserving young boy of all. The film was adapted from the story \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" by British author Roald Dahl, who was famously furious about the alterations made by screenwriter David Seltzer.When Charlie and his Grandpa Joe (played with warmth by Jack Albertson) arrive at the chocolate factory to attend their tour, the real fun starts. Willy Wonka is the most fascinating of film characters, completely unpredictable from the outset. Emerging for the first time, cane in hand, the seemingly frail Wonka limps painfully towards the waiting crowd before tumbling into a lively somersault. Once inside the factory, the eccentric genius can be funny, musical, sarcastic, rude and even a little sadistic, spouting off quotes from Shakespeare, O'Shaughnessy and Allingham as the naughty children around him systematically receive their comeuppance. The chocolate factory is operated by a race of little people known as Oompa Loompas, who celebrate the departure of each disobedient child by singing of the evils of being gluttonous, greedy, spoiled, or ill-behaved {these particular sequences are the only ones, I think, that have aged poorly over the last 35 years}.Despite a generally-positive critical reaction upon its release, 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' was a box-office failure, though time has allowed subsequent generations to discover the incalculable magic that the film holds. The musical numbers \u0096 ranging from \"The Candy Man\" to \"(I've Got a) Golden Ticket\" to \"Pure Imagination\" \u0096 are all touching and joyous, and there is even a peculiar psychedelic boat ride that slips into the realm of surrealism. The visual effects are decidedly remarkable for the era, and I was particularly impressed with the Fizzy Lifting Drinks sequence, in which Charlie and Grandpa Joe become weightless and float perilously towards the fan spinning high above them; there is not a supporting wire to be seen. The film was nominated for a single Academy Award, for Best Music, but it's almost criminal that Harper Goff's art direction went unrewarded, despite Willy Wonka's chocolate factory being one of the most amazing film sets I've ever seen.",

If, on the other hand, are curious to find out why this 1971 outing is considered a cult movie, give it a try.The story is well known:five kids,including Charlie Bucket(Peter Ostrum) find the Golden Tickets and get to visit the local chocolate factory,where they will see weird inventions,the charming Oompa Loompas and,most of all,the man behind the whole thing,Willy Wonka(Gene Wilder).There are only two things both versions (Mel Stuart and Tim Burton's, that is) have in common:the Oompa Loompas singing after the bad kids are \"punished\",and,in a certain way,the opening sequence.Charlie's relationship with Grandpa Joe gets more attention than in the remake,while on the other hand there are more musical numbers,which actually are the one thing I don't like about the movie(people complained about them in Burton's version as well, but at least Danny Elfman's work had some appeal).They're beautifully choreographed,that's true,but the dull, obnoxious songs aren't exactly like in Disney films. In fact, they make the film more childish and less Dahl-likeWilder's Wonka, the best thing in the film, is sweet, funny, unpredictable, but still human, the exact opposite of Johnny Depp's crazy lone wolf.This movie is suitable for everybody, no matter the age(Burton's version isn't something 4-year olds should watch), and, despite a few differences between film and book, and the musical numbers,quite enjoyable.If,however,you're a purist,stick with Johnny Depp, but you have to admit Gene Wilder is great too.Sweet viewing,children (and grown-ups)...",

Erm, isn't that basically Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka?

And the greatest thing is, it only gets more hilarious as I get older.I remember how incredibly bad I wanted to win a golden ticket and make my way into that goodie-filled candy factory. Each scene was decadent and filled with as much eye-candy as real candy in a way only the 60's and 70's could do it. I loved the songs because they weren't sung by singers. Yes, they weren't all that great, but that's what was so amazing. Real human voices that didn't come out of the synthetic can. Plus, they didn't make me sound like crap when I joined in. I also like that none of these people (excluding Gene Wilder) are very well known. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen any of them outside this film. It helps make the characters all the more real.The humor is amazing in the film, and it works on so many levels! I used to think this movie was hilarious because of all the silly situations, but now I listen to what Willy Wonka is actually saying, and I can hardly stop laughing. Its genius.As I said earlier, the cast was really genuine and great, but the absolute gem of the film is without a doubt Gene Wilder. He IS Willy Wonka. Wild, fun, just a tinge of darkness, and INSANE. No matter what film I see him in, I always first think Willy Wonka. His every nuance is perfection. On the basis of seeing him alone, I'd recommend this to anyone.",

            "content": "Finally I had a chance to watch this movie, which is a popular and beloved fantasy/musical among children. Because this is the original film, naturally I had big expectations that it would be much better than the 2005 \"remake\". It is certainly superior to the 2005 \"remake\", but not as much as I imagined. While it certainly isn't a tremendous film, it is perfectly watchable, entertaining and without much bad stuff. But I found it just okay. I didn't find it good enough to consider it a true classic or good enough to add to my movie collection.Now, seriously. The movie is for sure much more elaborate and appealing than the 2005 \"remake\". The sceneries are much more natural-looking and way more pleasant to look at (for example, the factory looks beautiful outside, especially with that church-like tower with a clock, and the factory itself is so much nicer inside than in the 2005 version). Frankly, Gene Wilder makes a much better and more likable Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder is exactly what Willy Wonka is supposed to be: eccentric and enigmatic, but without being a weirdo and also without that horrible haircut and without a dark sense of humor. Johnny Depp, on the other, makes a too weird and eccentric Willy Wonka with a dark sense of humor and an awful haircut, in a controversial combination that resembles Michael Jackson. The ending of this movie is very different (and better) either.In this movie, even the \"bratty\" kids aren't that annoying. Except for Veruca (the spoiled and selfish girl), the others aren't excessive. Violet, for example, isn't as irritating as the same character in the 2005 version and the same happens with Mike Teavee. In fact, only in one or two brief scenes Mike Teavee proves to be rude. Otherwise, he's funny for his cowboy-like clothes and attitudes. Charlie Bucket is, naturally, the nicest kid.Like I said, Gene Wilder is great as Willy Wonka. Peter Ostrum was great as Charlie Bucket (his only movie role ever), Paris Themmen is pretty cool as the TV-obsessed Mike Teavee and Jack Albertson is good as Grandpa Joe. Mel Stuart made a much better job by directing this movie than Tim Burton in the \"remake\".Another attribute here is the soundtrack. The songs are charming. Besides, the movie is made in an old-fashioned style, another reason why it is superior to the modern version.I like the scene when Grandpa Joe and Charlie are floating in the air between balls of soap, but I think it is too much what happens to Violet when she tastes something she shouldn't. Besides, those Oompa-Loompas bug me for some reason - I don't like them any better than those from the 2005 version, but at least here they always wear the same clothes, unlike that balderdash we see in the recent film. Looking at this movie, almost everything seems so fake and artificial in the \"remake\".",

            "content": "While some may argue that this version of the story is not as faithful to the Roald Dahl book as Tim Burton's recent remake Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it is still a far better movie.The story of an eccentric candy maker named Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) who has offered a tour of his very secretive factory along with a life time supply of chocolate to anyone that finds one of the 5 golden tickets hidden inside Wonka Chocolate bars.One young boy Charlie Bucket can hardly afford to buy a single bar but dreams of finding one of the tickets and taking his Grampa Joe (Jack Albertson) with him on the tour.The interior of the candy factory though done on a limited budget and without the benefit of modern CGI was and is awe inspiring, particularly for children. Apparently to achieve the look of wonder on the faces of the children they were not shown this set until filming began.One standout aspect of this film was certainly the music, to this day the songs from the film remain captivating. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Music, Scoring Adaptation and Original Song Score. One of songs written for the film was The Candy Man which would become a standard for Sammy Davis Jr.As good as Johnny Depp is as an actor; the role of Willy Wonka was handled more effectively by the very talented Gene Wilder. Unfortunately the Depp portrayal comes across as a bit too creepy.Another aspect of the film where it exceeds the remake is the portrayal of the Oompa Loompa's. Instead of eerie miniature digital recreations of a single actor we have a group of little people including at least one female, and most of whom could not speak English.",

I don't mind if they change some things like the squirrels to geese, because they did not have the technology to do squirrels. But changing the song lyrics and adding their own songs, that was bad. The Ommpa Loompas were all wrong, how anyone could even come up with the idea of making their skin orange and hair green is anyone's guess. I could have done with out the demonic chanting when their on the boat. Have you even read the lyrics? Wonka & Cast: Round the world and home again That's the sailor's way Faster faster, faster fasterThere's no earthly way of knowing Which direction we are going There's no knowing where we're rowing Or which way the river's flowingIs it raining, is it snowing Is a hurricane a-blowingNot a speck of light is showing So the danger must be growing Are the fires of Hell a-glowing Is the grisly reaper mowingYes, the danger must be growing For the rowers keep on rowing And they're certainly not showing Any signs that they are slowingThis is scary. Is Wonka trying to kill these kids? And they say that the new movie is dark. At least Wonka warns them, and not in the weird way Wilder did. Sure, he has not been around people in a while and he obviously cares more about his candy than the kids, but he should still care a little. Do yourself a favor and never see this horrid movie.",

Sorry Johnny I love you in most of your other movies. In a nutshell, Gene Wilder is the only Willy Wonka that matters. A strong person with vulnerabilities that are better left unrevealed. This film is about virtue, fantasy, and life ... Not necessarily in that order. While it is unfair for me to judge Depp. For hes just following bosses orders. The criticism must stick. Willy Wonka is a movie that disperses lessons as much if not more so than a candyman disperses sweets. The ensemble of music is just so magical. Learning new lessons from the Oompahs with no computer generated oompahs I might add. Yes at times the lessons are corny...but so what. This is a fine movie that makes us realize that riches come from within . Fantasy has never been better. I cringe every time Wilder does that somersault. Despite the fact the Wonka Factory looks eerily like the building used in Hostel , as its torturing headquarters... I still love this movie.",

The actors were ok, i suppose, especilly gene wilder, who is just a fabulous actor any way in any movie, but certain points of the movie and just the plot itself made me cringe with disgust. What annoyed me the most though was those delighful orange faced, fluffy shoed umpa lumpas and there wonderful little rhymes. They haunt my day dreams and my dreams when im sleeping because them horrible little faces cannot just be forgotten and again the question of \"why\" popped up in my head. So all in all this movie has got to be the worst and most annoying movie i have ever seen and i would certainly not recommend buying it or even thinking about buying it unless you enjoy pain or are looking for a quick and easy way to end your life.

Oh, and these poor, poor kids that were \"traumatized\" by this wonderful movie as a child... I'm literally rolling on the floor laughing with amusement.  This movie illustrates just how much society has deteriorated since the early 1970's, how people are all too ready to run, to hide, to shield their children from the real world and instill their own fears into their kids, fears of reality.

The chocolate room is still an enchanting scene, even though I am grown up now. The scene still makes me want to try all the kinds of candy in the room.

It melted too easily when shipping it to stores! It was produced by a man better known for his low-budget documentaries than movies (David Wolper). That being said, there is very much to like and dislike about this \"children's classic movie.\" It is badly edited for pacing as the first half of it (finding the Golden Tickets) drags on forever. It is not until half-way through that we finally get to the wondrous factory where the second-half is almost \"golden\"--with a few flaws. The movie was obviously filmed in a foreign country. I always thought it was England, but I believe it was Germany! Flaws: 1. The \"chopped chicken head\" doesn't belong here even though it is in a nightmarish tunnel scene, along with snakes. Luckily, my kids never ever noticed it, but I always knew it was there. 2. There is a cruel-edge to what becomes of the gum-chewing, TV watching, gluttonous and spoiled children-but no one actually dies. (Whew!) The indoor candy factory sets are wonderful and the glass \"Wonkavator\" flight ultimately saves the film. 3. Not at all true to Roald Dahl's book, but most adaptations are not, even The Wizard of Oz! 4. Gene Wilder plays Willy Wonka in a rather strange and peculiar way. He shouts too much at Charley while telling him that he loses the contest after tasting \"fizzy-lifting\" drinks, as the bubble chamber needs to be re-sterilized. Most of the songs are pretty good. I actually like \"Come with Me to a World of Pure Imagination\" better than \"Candy Man\". Brilliant songs co-written by Leslie Bricusse (\"Oliver\").

Viewers need not be alarmed however: a book is a book and a film is a film and each should be its own beast, and authors are often the least people who should tell how the film version should be (to note: every Stephen King novel adapted by King has been an artistic failure, when the adaptations he disliked - mainly Shinning - were great), and this is a case study of the phenomenon.Who better than Gene Wilder to play the manic, reclusive and unhinged Willie Wonka? He bravely carries the whole film on his shoulders and is assisted by a very competent young cast. The general tone is just as wonderful, as, unlike the newer version, things aren't spelled out for us (the factory's logic, Wonka's origins), because the film trust children to understand its internal logic, a brave and fulfilling move that is too rarely seen in today's film output (and probably earned the film some scorn from bewildered parents, which would explain its initial box-office failure).This version is the one to see, and Gene Wilder's ambivalent psychopath soars beyond Johnny Depp's gloomy creation. Unlike Tim Burton's mismatched mess, this world brims with colors, the Umpalumpas are a touch sinister and there is that touch of underlying darkness (the demented boat ride). That this gem's ratings have gone up since Burton's misguided version was released only attest further to its staying power and greatness.So, in fewer words, let go of your adult arrogance, allow yourself to be a child again, and dive into Willie Wonka's magical world.

The costuming and sets are great, and although the special effects may seem a little archaic by today's CG stuff, it's still pretty good. The children in the film play the parts to perfection, the songs and music are fun and full of life and Gene Wilder is absolutely brilliant as Willy Wonka. But my favourite part of the film - the perfect, sweet last line.",

            "content": "Roald Dahl's classic children's book translates well to the screen, due to a strong cast and clever screenplay adaptation.Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) is the greatest candy maker of all time, but he and his candy making operations are shrouded in mystery. Legends about what happens behind the always-locked gates of his factory abound. One day, to everyone's delight, he issues five tickets, hidden in candy wrappers, for a personally guided tour of the factory and \"a lifetime supply of chocolate.\" The early part of the movie, dealing with the world wide scramble for the tickets, is inspired and hilarious. The main characters, a group of children, are introduced one at a time this way. Charly Bucket (Peter Ostrum) is a poor kid who desperately wants to meet Wonka, but despairs more with the news of each found ticket. He's the underdog for the audience to identify with and root for, and you do.The tour of the factory takes up the second half of the story, and provides plenty of laughs and surprise action. Wilder's performance as the colorful and eccentric Wonka is brilliant. He formulates the character to be both scary and funny. The movie benefits from a great assembly of child actors also; each one brought out the spirit and flaws of their characters well. There were also some recognizable faces among the parents who escorted them; notably Nora Denney and Jack Albertson who were great in their supporting roles. You can see why the kids act as they do, as the adults' personalities mirror the children's.You will also meet Wonka's helpers: the Oompa Loompas. They were a great addition, and served a variety of purposes in the story. Their songs were clever, fit the plot, great to sing along to, and just plain fun.It's one of the great children's' movies ever, that has enough going on to engage the interest of adults which makes for fun family viewing. It provides some clever insights about child/parent relationships as well, without bashing you over the head. A true must-see.",

There are just so many funny moments in this. The scenes with Mr. Turkentine are some of my favorites. This was a particularly good piece of writing. The scenes where the rush is on to get Wonka Bars are great too. Especially where the lady has to think about whether or not to give up a case of Wonka Bars to save her husband's life. The kids were all good in this, the parents were all good in this but the real shining star would have to be Gene Wilder. I'm a fan of all his movies but this performance was exquisite. His sarcasm humor, his wacky behavior and his one-liners are funny even by today's standards. Having seen the 2005 remake, there is absolutely no comparison. This is a clear case where the original is FAR superior to the remake. Favorite lines would have to be \"Speak a little louder, I'm a trifle deaf in one ear\" and of course (the rebuttal to spitting being a dirty habit) \"I can think of a worse one\". Combine that to all of the scenes (no exception) where the kids do something stupid in the factory that results in the consequences we all remember. \"Don't, Stop, Come Back!\" \"Always when they get to the desert\" That's Funny! This holds up today as a good one. The Oompa Loompas were good too. I'm amazed at how well they were able to coordinate seeing as how many of them spoke different languages, very impressive!Like everything that Gene Wilder plays a leading character in, he really embodies this one. You can watch this one over and over and you have to admit that he really nailed that one. Perfect 10 out of 10",

A beautifully stunning film with set pieces good enough to eat and music so delightful it makes you want to cry. I don't really care if Roald Dahl hated it, I loved it and makes up for that empty remake Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which is accurate to the source material but not appealing to the original. I believe Gene Wilder should have been at least nominated for an Oscar of his portrayal of the legendary candy maker.Overall if you haven't seen this film, you will be living in bland world until you take a golden ticket tour into Wonka's chocolate factory.

Though Willy Wonka is obviously crazy, he's crazy in a good way, and he sings two of my favorite songs. (One is about springtime being the ring-a-ling-a-ling time. The other is \"Pure Imagination.\") The oompah-loompahs also sing songs with real meaning about the behavior of children which most parents should take a lesson from. It's an educational farce about the problems of our modern world coming from the permissiveness of parents who allow their children to indulge in all sorts of selfish gratification. Chewing gum, overeating, watching too much television, and general greed and covetousness are all condemned, and finally, integrity is praised. This is a movie all children should see, and parents who haven't seen it should see it as well, though they might want to fast-forward through the first half-hour.",

I know that the new Depp vehicle will be a better version of the book and Dahl's fantastic writing will come to life through Tim Burton, but I doubt if the new movie will ever take away from the magic of Gene Wilder; the acting by the five fantastic kids; and of course, the chocolate.

            "content": "The original children's novel by Roald Dahl was a story with good values and intentions; Charlie is the only one to not succumb to greed or vanity or disobedience like the rest of the bratty visitors, so at the end he is declared the winner of the competition and reaps the rewards. Simple enough. There is a different twist here - Charlie and his grandpa also disobey Wonka by taking a sip of Fizzy Lifting Drinks and very nearly meet their grisly fate too, and it is only by sheer luck that they escape this fact. This seems entirely unnecessary to me; it muddles Charlie and Grandpa Joe's characterisation to scold and disapprove of fat Augustus Gloop for not the following the rules and then hypocritically do so themselves. And better for Charlie to remain wholesome and pure because of his upbringing than to force a decision which does not seem fair for him to make. We do not know that Slugworth's offer is just a test, so it does not seem so dastardly to take the money and improve their lives.The film has its fair share of musical segments, some of which are more effective than others. It is a little too much to ask the elderly and youthful actors of the Bucket family to pour out their emotions in song; none of them are particularly good singers and lack the ability or charisma to fully emote through them. Gene Wilder does not have the same problem, and makes everything he touches a delight, from the whimsy and wonder of Pure Imagination, to his very first appearance, where he takes an eternity to hobble to the gate only to stumble with sleight of hand and pop up with a flourish. This was apparently Wilder's own idea; the effect has us questioning each part of Wonka's calculated performance, each absurd fact of his chocolate production, each half sinister joke of the children's demise and held syllable. The Oompa Loompa's bizarre accompaniment further muddle his intentions. What Mel Stuart does add from the novel is actually quite brilliant. He envisions a world so dominated by the quest for the golden tickets that the mania seeps everywhere into daily lives, with hilarious consequences. This is illustrated through several scenes in the guise of comedy sketches; professional psychiatry offices heeding the worlds of insanity, the media blustering all about, the British queen overbidding an auction for precious remaining Wonka bars, even a wife reconsidering the kidnapping of her husband. And there is the presence of Slugworth, like the grim reaper, instantly appearing behind the ears of each winner, tall and dressed in black. He beckons the eerie gates and estate of Wonka himself. And what is within is truly a marvel to behold. There would later be another flashy, garish remake of the same novel from none other than Tim Burton, and a freakishly impeccable Johnny Depp. But it does not match the charm of this.",

It however, has not lost its charm or enjoyment, just because I'm an adult now. It just allows me to have two unique perspectives, that easily allow me to put myself into a 1971 frame of mind. It is felt, especially in relation to Willy's (Gene Wilder's), main introduction, when he makes his first appearance in the movie. It's kind of a lackluster moment when you look at it as an older viewer. It is so much bigger an entrance when seeing it as a kid. You notice as an adult that Gene handles the whole situation great, by making it look more like a businessman doing business. We don't really care though. We've been inundated with delicious, chocolate imagery up to this point, that we just want to get into the factory. It doesn't matter what age you are. You still feel the same.Five golden tickets are placed into random Wonka chocolate bars. Whoever finds the golden tickets receives a free tour of Wonka's chocolate factory. Charlie (Peter Ostrum), our main character, finds the last golden ticket. Along with his grandfather Joe (Jack Albertson), they go to meet Willy Wonka, the other four ticket winners and get the grand tour of the famed chocolate factory. From here you are taken into a magical world with chocolate streams and candy flowers. But, there are other strange things afoot in this factory. There is a weird mood felt all through the film. It is driven by the eccentric energy of Gene Wilder. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for music. It has many familiar tunes, especially the haunting Oompa-Loompa song, which always reminds us, that temptation sometimes can be a person's undoing. The special effects, art direction and entertainment value is quite good in this Paramount Pictures release. It is one, that kids from the 1970s and ever since can enjoy. It also is a wonderful film for those children to see, when they get older too. Plus, chocolate is great.8.0 (B- MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

This was an adaptation that would live or die on the casting of the lead role, and in Gene Wilder they couldn't have done much better. Wilder's perfect balance of eccentricity, humour and mystery elevates the film above and beyond gentle fiction and provides a very fitting dose of darkness.The rest of the cast is also pretty strong, particularly Julie Dawn Cole as the bratty Veruca Salt. Peter Ostrum looks and sounds just right as Charlie, although the character is somewhat overshadowed by Wilder's mesmerising Wonka. Paris Themman is quite poor as Mike Teevee but I would largely put that down to the character being so badly written by Dahl. I would have been perfectly happy for them to write Teevee out of the script completely.The music is a huge success, containing some iconic songs that are still fresh almost 50 years later. Leslie Bricusse deserves an awful lot of credit for what he did with this soundtrack. Pure Imagination is particularly beautiful and is probably my enduring memory of this movie.The major weak point of the film is how cheap some of it looks. The factory looks like just that- a factory. It has no magic, no beauty and no charm. The chocolate river looks like contaminated water and the 'TV particles' effect stands as one of the laziest pieces of CGI I've ever seen.There are also plenty of flaws in the story that bother me. It seems perfectly reasonable for the destitute Charlie to sell the everlasting gobstopper to Slugworth, and had he done so I don't think it would tarnish his character. On the flip side, the wealthy Veruca could have turned down the offer merely because the money wasn't meaningful enough for it to be worth effort. She'd still be a bad person either way. Wonka really should have considered this financial relativism before devising his bizarre inheritance plan. Also, what if only adults had won tickets? Or if all the children were non-English speaking? Besides this, most of the logistical flaws are Dahl's doing (seriously, a kid who lives a few hundred yards from the factory finds a Golden Ticket at the local shop?) and the writers can't do much about it.Despite a few flaws, this is a great family film with a captivating lead performance from Gene Wilder. It is certainly not as polished as Tim Burton's remake but it has an awful lot more charm and character.",

Possibly the best - certainly one of the most underrated - James Bond films has his name as screenwriter, (You Only Live Twice) and this movie is equally delightful and grand in scale.\nThe first half of the film is a curiously old-fashioned, child-centred piece, where a whole nation of adults alter their lifestyles for a chance to win a \"Golden Ticket\". \"Class dismissed\" calls one teacher as he rushes out to buy a potentially winning chocolate bar. Another scene sees a bed-ridden cripple, perhaps slightly offensively, get out of bed and dance after winning a ticket. Good-natured yet packed with racial stereotypes (including greedy Germans, arrogant Americans and Charlie's grandparents who are, for some reason, Jewish) the film can be saccharine-coated but that is all saved by one man: Gene Wilder.Charlie, meanwhile, is the kind of selfless martyr that really deserves a slap, if only to dislodge his halo. (And he's a litter-dropper, too: look at the scene where he inevitably finds the final ticket. Come to that, he's a thief: he finds money yet doesn't hand it in to the police). Things notably improve in the second half, if only the quality of the songs. This is the half where we go from drab to ultra-imaginative, with Wilder's enigmatic \u0096 if disturbingly tactile \u0096 Wonka steals the film. His total sense of disattachment at the various downfalls of the children adds an interesting depth to the character; and a refreshing counterpoint to the somewhat self-righteous attitudes of Charlie, his grandfather and the Oompa-Loompas.Highlights of Wonka's chocolate factory include the \"Repulsion\" \u0096style coathangers, candy packed with gelagnite and a man-sized teleporting chocolate bar. For a film that's reaching its thirtieth anniversary these effects still stand up remarkably well. Best though is the social conscience. There's the odd nod towards war and ecology, but what about the Oompa-Loompa song \u0096 the best of six in the film \u0096 where they philosophise over what causes deviant behaviour in children? \"You know who's exactly to blame,\" they conclude, \"the mother and the father\".As with all works of Dahl, what really makes the film is his wonderful sense of almost malicious perversity. A dark, almost sadistic, air echoes just beneath the surface. Just one question though: has anyone ever got round to reading the sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator?",

Among other very spoiled children, a very poor and generous boy tries his luck and to his surprise, finds the last golden ticket.

It's very enjoyable and amusing, while Willy's character is playing a great part in this unique atmosphere. In the end, we'll find Wonka's true intentions regarding his unexpected and special tour, a happy ending being mandatory here.

This is largely due to spotty dialogue and underwhelming character development. Fortunately, Wilder delivers much needed charisma to the story with his convincing persona as the titular character. Still, this wonderful character is criminally underused and undoubtedly underdeveloped, making some scenes more creepy than hilarious, as they could have been. Therefore, the comedy is middling, even with its few great moments. The plot feels very formulaic and rushed, as well, giving way to a resolution that should be satisfying, but fails to be in lack of a setup. Again, this is a result of not introducing the main, or should be main, character until the second act. On top of it, the other lead characters have conflicting motivations throughout, ultimately making them unlikable and leaving the audience extra unsatisfied with the conclusion. Plot holes were abundant, too. The editing was oddly executed, likely failing because of the musicality of the feature that took much away from the plot. The soundtrack itself is split, with a couple good, catchy songs and a few poorly written ones. Scoring turned out to be a plus, though, helping craft a fitting atmosphere for most sequences. Overall, this is a feature with a good premise and awesome lead, that altogether fails to deliver a well written and nicely executed plot.",

I admit, it's not a 'sweet' (unless you count the candy - YUM!) film, but most kids aren't that sweet either.  Most children over the age of eight should find it a wild and enjoyable ride.  And I think a lot of kids would be glad to see the brats get their comeuppance.  Remember, these children are exaggerations, so I doubt any kid would see themselves in the character.

There is no overly memorable songs, Gene Wilder completely steals the show (which is good because his performance is fantastic, but bad because Charlie is not in the focus, hence the changed name of the movie compared to the book) and stuff is added/changed for no reason. That doesn't mean this is a bad movie and it is most certainly better than Burton's version in which Wonka acts like a schizophrenic, but it pales when being compared to the masterpiece like \"The Wizard of Oz\" (some stuff are added/changed here too, but the dynamic of the movie remains stable throughout the whole deal) which is also a musical based on a book for children. All in all, I give the movie 8/10! It's still a wonderful movie, but the fans of the book will notice the difference and will probably be somewhat displeased, while the rest won't even notice, and for them I say 10/10! :)",

As a child, I read most of Dahl's fare and found most of it pretty lame (PARTICULARLY his really stupid sequel to \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" what was it called, \"The Great Glass Elevator,\" or something like that?) The only thing he ever wrote that even remotely creeped me out was \"The Magic Finger.\" He should have written that and only that and then gotten a day job. One of the big laughable things about \"Willie Wonka\" is the Dickensian thing. When not at home Charlie appears to live in the prosperous 1960's USA. But at home, he appears to live the life of Oliver Twist. His ma took in laundry and stirred it in a large cauldron. They hurt for every penny, ate cabbage soup. Where was DFACS? Did they not get food stamps?\nAnd Jack Albertson's character should have been really ashamed of himself. He hadn't been out of bed for twenty years? Once up and about, he seemed quite robust to me. The only thing that makes this movie worth a damn is Gene Wilder. He is a dark master. SPOLIER ALERT!The ending was different also. In the book, Charlie did no wrong. In the movie, he stole Fizzy Lifting Drinks. In the book, Willie Wonka (who had no dark side) suddenly noticed that Charlie was the only one left and declared him the winner. In the movie, he had to pass the final test. (Making the movie superior.)In the movie, the Oompa-Loopmas were orange. In the book they were black. (Making the book racist, but not the movie.) The movie improved upon the book. Roald Dahl was a hack. But at least he had the sense to marry Patricia Neal. As a child, I had a crush on Julie Dawn Cole.",

The movie itself just oozes whimsically fun. From its sets that are very reminiscent of such works as Alice in wonderland and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. To its iconic songs you get this very colorful fancy family picture., but you get this emotional story through the perspective of charlie seeing this world through his eyes his character we are along for the ride. Charlie himself you feel for him he doesn't have much money and doesn't live in the best living condition with his family. You can see he wants better and more. You feel a connection with this kid. You want him to be rewarded in the end. You spend a fair amount of the beginning of the movie getting to know him and setting up the rest of the kids and just how spoiled and ungrateful they are which perfectly conveys the message of the film. Gene Wilder as Willy is a loving and charming demeanor that is brought to the character from the moment you arrive at the factory. To when he steps out to meet the audience you know that this guy has all kinds of fun tricks up his sleeves. The Wackiness of the factory fitted alongside his personality that's odd, but entertaining at the same time. Everybody else is this bizarre to him it's Tuesday. I also can't help but love the absurda of the film not just from the factory, but even in the beginning with everybody looking for the tickets. You got people bidding on boxes of chocolate and armed escort from airports. That is so ridiculously absurd that it's funny. It's a timeless classic and one that can always be sitting down to down on your own or with the family.",

But I decided to review it now since there is nothing else to do. I have finally decided my favorite movie I have seen so far in my lifetime and that would not be this movie but the movie I reviewed before this and that movie is\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085 \"The Untouchables\" and I realize that \"The Untouchables\" is R rated and is very violent but who cares? I liked it anyway and that's that. Going on\u0085 this movie is another spectacular film of its time and it is starring Charlie (Peter Ostrum), his grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson), and Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder)! Let me define this movie and I know almost all the lines by heart since I've seen it about a thousand times. Okay, Charlie hears about golden tickets (5) being put into (obviously) 5 Wonka bars being shipped all over the world. Charlie does not have confidence that he is going to win but yet he\u0085 (You know the story). He discovers an amazing chocolate factory from a chocolate waterfall, to a dark tunnel, to an inventing room, to an Oompa Loompa, to a HSAWAKNOW (which is WONKAWASH spelled backwards), to a Wonkavision room, to another Oompa Loompa, and so on\u0085 I did not list all of the things Charlie and the other brats saw because I'm too lazy. Going on\u0085 Charlie (according to Willy Wonka) is the best most docile person inside the factory but Charlie doesn't know that. Then Charlie seems to have more confidence in himself because all the other brats are all gone except for him at the end of the movie. You find out the ending and by now you should know that without me telling you. This film was remade with the same people except Charlie's dad was in the remake. The dad was dead in the original film \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\". The very quirky Tim Burton directed \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I'm a fan of him but when it came to seeing that movie, I was not too fond of him. Later I went to see \"Tim Burton's Corpse Bride\" and that was a great movie so I changed my mind again about Tim Burton. Okay?! Got it?! Why did I like \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\"? Because I thought the story was very unique (duh Roald Dahl) and because it had good acting esp. by Gene Wilder and it was overall entertaining. Movie directed by Mel Stuart.",

It is my all time favorite movie and the newer remake will never replace it, even if the remake is just OK. The movie is about when the crazy candy maker, Willy Wonka sends out 5 Golden Tickets for a chance to win a tour through his amazing candy factory, run by the mysterious green-haired, orange-faced Oompa Loompa elves, and also win a lifetime supply of chocolate. The children who find them are a spoiled brat named Veruca Salt, a loudmouthed TV addict named Mike Teevee, gumchewer Violet Beauregard, gluttonous Augustus Gloop, and Charlie Bucket--a poor boy who lives with his mom and 4 bedridden grandparents in small house. 4 of the children get their demise thanks to their usual behavior, except for Charlie, and is promised to win a lifetime supply of chocolate, but is almost not given it because he and his Grandpa Joe broke one of Wonka's rules by drinking Fizzy lifting drinks and almost getting chopped to bits by a fan on the ceiling and dirtying it when they bumped into it. However, after Wonka dismisses Charlie and Grandpa Joe, Charlie gives back the Everlasting Gobstopper candy that he gave each of the kids earlier. The gobstopper was Wonka's most secret recipe and he finds out that he passed Mr. Wonka's test of honesty and is given the factory because Mr. Wonka couldn't work there forever, and he wanted to find an honest loving child who can be told all of Wonka's most precious candymaking secrets, and take care of the Oompa Loompas. My favorite parts are when Grandpa Joe does his victory dance \"I've Got a Golden Ticket,\" surprisingly after being bedridden for 20 years, when Charlie finds the ticket and runs home, the psychedelic boat trip, Augustus Gloop falling into the chocolate river, Violet Beauregarde turning into a blueberry thanks to some very special gum, the group first seeing the Chocolate Room, (while Mr. Wonka sings Pure Imagination) when Mr. Wonka leads the group through the beginning of the factory (MR. SALT--Is this some kind of funhouse? WONKA: Why, having fun?) the Wonkawash scene and the very end, when Charlie, Grandpa Joe, and Willy are in the Wonkavator. I know I have more but that's all I can think of. All I can say is, this movie is pure magic, and full of pure imagination, for young and old. So what if it doesn't have fancy computer effects like the 2005 remake? This movie is all real. The 1971 version will always be the best to me, because it's simple, fantastic, magic, funny, and Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka. Maybe this version isn't true to the book like the 2005 version but this version is special in it's own way. It will remain my favorite movie of all time, with The Muppet Movie probably being second on my list. To end my review, I will say my favorite(and final) line from this movie. \"Don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he always wanted\u0097he lived happily ever after.\" That line sums up the sheer brilliance and innocence (OK maybe a few parts are a little dark and scary) of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.",

            "content": "Mel Stuart took viewers to a world of pure imagination in his 1971 feature Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. In perhaps his most well-known role, Gene Wilder as the eccentric candy man looking to pass on his chocolate legacy created a brilliant film adaptation of the book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. Wilder's exquisite performance proved he could command an entire film, despite him only being in the film's second half. A fun family experience, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory spans generations to bring pure imagination to all ages.Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder), candy extraordinaire is well known for being a recluse in his chocolate factory. Fearing intrusion, he has locked himself in his factory free to invent and produce the best chocolate the world has known without threat. When word breaks that Willy Wonka will open his factory to 5 winners of golden tickets hidden in his chocolate bars, the world is stunned as they all scatter, ravishing his bars to gain entry into his elusive chocolate paradise. Young Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) of meager means, believes that he has to win a golden ticket because he wants the prize more than anyone else does. After all 5 of the golden tickets are discovered, Charlie cries in his room devastated to have missed out on meeting the man his grandfather always told him stories about. To console himself, Charlie treats himself to a Wonka bar after he finds some money in the street. To his surprise, just after he buys the bar, the news breaks that the fifth golden ticket was a fake. With the last shred of hope in him, Charlie opens his bar to find a glimmer of gold around his candy bar. After racing home to tell his family the good news, Charlie, and Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) prepare for their trip to the chocolate factory the next day. Wearing a purple velvet coat, Willy Wonka greets the guests to his factory walking with a cane, that he gets stuck in a brick and falls forward in a fantastic somersault. From this point on, Willy Wonka's credibility is questioned as he leads the children and their families through his factory where there are \"little surprises around every turn\". Some of those surprises result in removal of the children from the factory until only Charlie is left to discover Willy Wonka's motives for opening his chocolate paradise. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a sincere treat for children and parents alike. A fun moral movie that is never too overt with its message, Willy Wonka is an experience to have as often as possible. The worst part of this movie is waiting the 47 minutes of well-done build-up before we actually get to see Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder is fantastic in the role of the mysterious peculiar owner of the candy empire. He has his perfect moments of emotion, which he is often accused of overdoing the yelling--a criticism I find unfounded. I read that he had to fight to have his opening scene filmed the way that made it into the movie, with his walking being aided by a cane. It was a good decision on behalf of Mel Stuart to relent and film it this way, because, from that moment on, you never knew what Mr. Wonka was capable of, nor did you understand his motives. This mystery was necessary to the story, and a bit of the premise the film depends on upon would have been lost without it. This bit of trivia just further goes to support what an acting genius Gene Wilder is.Always do as your told, follow rules and authority, adults are looking out for your best interests are the easy messages to take away from this film. Upon closer inspection, however, one can see that the adults are no better equipped to look after themselves than their children are. It is an adult that is trying to steal from Mr. Wonka, and get the kids to steal his secrets, it is the adults that are encouraging their kids to do Slugworth's bidding, and it is the adults who find it difficult to resist the temptations around them. Maybe the bigger message is that there's a little childlike wonder left in all of us, as long as we don't try to hard to extinguish it. The adults become just as enchanted as the children when they first enter Mr. Wonka's brilliant candy-filled world. Maybe, just maybe, the underlying message is that we all advance in age as we make it through life, but if we are careful, we never have to grow up. I stick with that message, Willy Wonka doesn't live too bad of a life, after all.",

Yeah, the Oompa-Loompa's \"sang\" in the book, but the words were completely different. And there was a Mr. Bucket, Charlie's father, in the book. But he wasn't in the movie at all. What's up with that? I haven't seen the remake yet. I'm sure it's just as good, if not better, than this film. But I know it's not a musical like the original. (At least I hope it isn't.)My only other problem is how it ended. Mr. Wonka, Charlie, and Grandpa Joe were in the Great Glass Elevator; (although Mr. Wonka calls it a \"Wonkavator\") the last part was them flying through the sky.In the book, they actually go back to Charlie's house and pick up the rest of the family. They don't do it in this movie. Why? Other than that, it's not bad. I just wish they hadn't turned it into a musical.My REAL score: 6/10",

            "review_title": "Frustrating. This movie could have been and should have been so much better.",
            "content": "Well the first thing you should notice about this film is that the life of Charlie Bucket seems to be nothing more than a cruel, endless cycle of crushing poverty and cabbage water. That is until...I've seen this film a number of times over the years and sadly with all it's great potential it never does completely deliver. Which is a shame, because the film has a terrifically quirky and unusual premise. But I refuse to lie to myself, because I can readily see and hear the many flaws in this film, especially in it's first half, which alternates from being drab and boring, to shrill and irritating. All the while very little of it's humor gels together, making for some very tedious viewing, worse yet are those lame, go-nowhere songs that occur early in the movie. It's only when they get to the Wonka factory that things pick up and the films eccentricities immediately increase ten-fold. However half of this movie IS boring. Gene Wilder (RIP) is simply fantastic as Willy Wonka, the eccentric King of Candy and his performance is, unquestionably, the best thing about the movie; he injects the film with some desperately needed energy, excitement and purpose - which partly makes up for the films painfully slow start.Not surprisingly the second half of the movie is much better, as we the audience are treated to a walking tour of Mr. Wonka's one-of-a-kind chocolate factory, where there is a surprise around every corner. With that being said I think Warner Brothers could have definitely splashed more cash on this film, as I find Wonka's factory, on a visual basis, to be small in scale and a bit underwhelming in it's design; starting with the factory's front gate, in fact from an exterior standpoint, there isn't a single thing that catches your eye, it's completely plain Jane on the outside. The interior sets fare better, but still this film will never win any Oscar's for Art Direction or Set Design, yet had this film been made to the caliber that it should have been, it would have easily won in both those categories. But sadly I find Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory to be a rather ponderous and distinctly underwhelming experience and 46 years after it's release the whole film looks very, very dated. It looks ugly. And while on that note, of all the movies I've ever seen, this film must have one of the ugliest casts of all time; who are made even uglier by their bad clothes and worse hair-cuts and/or comb-overs - particularly the parents of the contest winners. And surely I'm not alone with my hatred for that loud-mouthed, spoiled-rotten, bratty little bitch, Veruca \"I WANT IT NOW!\" Salt! SHE SUCKS! As does her repulsively irritating pappy; these two characters are more a detriment to the film then they are an asset, curiously enough I do like her song though, which is the only one of the movies numerous songs that catches my ear. On her singing number you could say that her bitchiness finally paid off in her final scene, right before Wonka's \"Eggdicator\" determines her, correctly, to be a bad egg.Throughout the tour Willy Wonka keeps things going in a very lively and quirky direction, his factory is indeed loaded with many gimmicks and surprises. Including the fact that in every other room of his factory it looks like there are numerous health code violations being committed, as things often look unsanitary. And is anyone going to object when I mention the fact that machine/set that makes Wonka's \"Everlasting Gobstopper's\" looks as lame, as it does cheap. They clearly didn't try too hard on that one. Once again the Wonka factory should have been a supreme showpiece, a marvel of set design, but unfortunately that's not what we get and that's another missed opportunity, in fact you can say that about nearly every aspect of this film. I have this theory that had it been made 15 years later, in the mid-80's, it would have been so much better, that would have been the perfect time for this movie (for multiple reasons) - not 1971. For instance when this was made Gene Wilder was only in his late-30's, yet at the end of the movie he's all ready to give his factory away to Charlie. What sense does that make??? Early retirement? Then there's the aforementioned dated appearance of the film. The way I see it it's a shame that this project wasn't shelved for a decade-and-a-half. With all that being said Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is still a much better than Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's hideous remake \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", which has the same problems as the first film, only in reverse; the factory looks spectacular, however, the film is utterly ruined by Johnny Depp's hideous performance. Depp made for a VERY weak and effeminate Willy Wonka, a real dandy - Wilder was infinitely better in the role.Ultimately for the reasons given I find Willy Wonka and the Chocholate Factory to be a frustrating and disappointing movie, which had the potential to be a lot better than it ultimately is. This film stands as one of the best examples of Hollywood failing to seize upon and capitalize on what should have been a golden screen epic. Instead it's a botched and somewhat lazily executed film.... but still much better then Burton's Blunder.On a lighter note, whose with me on thinking that \"the most perfect high in existence\" could be achieved through the lighter-than-air combination of Willy Wonka's Fizzy Lifting Drink and (if I were a druggie) a giant, slow-burning, reefer one that's over-flowing with the worlds most potent pot. Tell me that wouldn't be quite a marvelous combination... made better yet if Wonka himself were to make clouds of cotton-candy, as they float low and lazily, that would only further the experience as you're on your way up-up-up to ethereal ecstasy.",

            "content": "\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" (1971), I remember the very first time I saw this movie as a child. To this day, I'm still blown away with how great this film is. It has found a spot on my list of my top 10 all-time favorite family films. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline is based off the book \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", written by Roald Dahl. Originally, the film script was going to be written entirely by Roald Dahl himself, along with David Seltzer. However, since Roald Dahl failed to meet deadlines, David Seltzer did some rewrites to the script and the story was changed. Now, in most cases, changing an original story from a book for cinema standards can make or break it. However, in the case of this movie, the changes made the plot line in the movie are a good thing. It made the film that much more entertaining than the original novel. Don't get me wrong, I still love the original book. It's a lot of fun to read! Here's something that might shock you, Roald Dahl hated this movie adaptation of his book so much that he disowned it! I can understand his anger of his book being changed. If you were in his shoes, you would probably feel upset too! But, for our benefit, the movie came out fantastic and the storyline keeps you hooked from beginning to end. Sorry, Roald Dahl..... I really love this film! As for the acting, it is stellar from all of the actors and actresses. The top three standout performances come from the one and only Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, Peter Ostrum as Charlie Bucket and Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe. They really make this movie! Gene Wilder is legendary and iconic as Willy Wonka. Peter Ostrum is absolutely phenomenal and charming as Charlie Bucket and Jack Albertson is funny and heartwarming as Grandpa Joe. Here's an interesting bit of history for you. This was the only role that Peter Ostrum played in his acting career. Isn't that something? This was the only time that Peter Ostrum acted in a motion picture. But, what a great performance it was! It's a shame that he didn't pursue acting any further, he had great potential. He is currently a veterinarian, which is still cool. It's what he wants to be, and who are we to deny him? As for the rest of the actors and actresses in this movie, they fire on all cylinders as well and definitely help bring this film to life! All of the sets/locations are perfect and give this film an amazing atmosphere. Of course, my favorite set in this movie has to be the Chocolate Room. Whenever I see a screenshot, or film clip of that room I can immediately pinpoint it to this movie. Talk about an iconic set! All of the rest of the rooms in the factory are just as breathtaking. As for the special effects, they are all very well-done. Some of them can get a bit cheesy at times, but that's what helps to give this movie it's special charm! Finally, the soundtrack written by: Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley and Walter Scharf is amazing and helps to tie the whole film together. I could hear any random part of this film score, and know right away that it's from this movie. That's the mark of a phenomenal film score! \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" is nothing but cinematic gold for people of all ages. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this film, go watch it, especially if you have kids. You'll make them very happy! I guarantee that they'll love this movie, and you will too. Grab your golden ticket, and prepare for an adventure!",

That's kind of ironic, because this is one of these films where the special effects are more realistic than the ones in the remake. And the remake was made in 2005! What does that tell you? The plot is rather good too. Sure, like I said, it strays from the book in some ways, but the characters seem to be more faithful to the book. Charlie is a normal human boy with flaws like everyone else. Violet isn't a tomboy and has a feminazi mother, Veruca throws tantrums and screams and the TV addict boy is smart as well as smart allecky. And Willy Wonka seemed more likable in this version as well.My favorite parts are the Oompa Loompa songs and the creepy boat ride scene. Come on, who wasn't freaked out by the boat scene when they were little? Sad that they don't make movies like this anymore. I recommend this movie all the way!",

The sets, the songs, the acting, it all comes together in such a delightful way even though Grandpa Joe is letting his family starve because he's too lazy to get out of bed.And every single character is so memorable, and every single one has at least one hilarious moment, like Charlie's teacher. He might only be in two scenes, but damn it he does not get enough credit. Gene Wilder definitely gets enough credit, but I'll give him a little more because he's funny, he's crazy, he's a little bit creepy, and he's everything Willy Wonka should be. And even the kids didn't set my teeth on edge unless they were supposed to.I did think the first half lacked a certain energy that a musical like this should have, and there are some bizarre tonal shifts in this portion too, but watching this film is like having a big gulp of a fizzy lifting drink, it fills you up and makes you feel warm and cosy, without the imminent threat of death at the merciless rotors of a giant fan. And I could never complain about that.",

What's neat about this movie is that there really are no special effects. Well, okay, there are some, but not many. In the scene where the people are eating all the flowers and stuff made of candy, it makes you so hungry. And when they lick the walls too. Funny!

They are just plain disturbing. Anyway, this is a good film. I can't believe Gene Wilder was Willy Wonka. He was great as him, but he normally does Mel Brooks films.I told you the plot in my comment for Charlie. A kid wins a Golden Ticket to go to Willy Wonka's factory and all the other kids are punished. However, the ending is just a bit different. Willy Wonka goes into his office and Charlie gives back his Ever-Lasting Gobstopper. Wonka is delighted and the film ends in the Great-Glass Elevator, which is pretty abrupt. This is also the soda room. Charlie and his grandfather are levitated off the ground until they hit a fan, but they belch to get down.Overall, this is a very fun film to watch. It has great songs, catchy tunes, good acting, and more. Although it may not be very faithful to the novel, it is still great. In the novel it ends with the Great-Glass Elevator crashing into Charlie's house, but int this it ends in the Great-Glass Elevator. Anyway, a lot of people can and will enjoy this 1971 flick. There is one thing I'd like to mention, the boat ride is really bizarre. Anyway, this is a nice film.8/10Recommended Films: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.",

Quoting classic literature and delivering every line with perfect comic timing and deadpan delivery. Can you imagine Roald Dahl's preferred choice of Spike Milligan playing Willy Wonka?* The film has a lot of dark comedy. I was a huge fan of Roald Dahl when I was a child and there was often a dark streak to his children's novels.* There is some great photography in places.* Every song is great in my opinion. Most musicals rarely have more than two good songs.The bad bits:\n* Some of the set design is very cheap looking. The giant sweets that look like painted beach balls, the fibreglass mushrooms, the chocolate river that looks more like mud.* With it being a 70s film, the boat scene is bit psychedelic, man. Very much of its time.* Unfortunately, it inspired Tim Burton to create an insipid and camp, but not very sincere remake.Overall, it is a bit creepy, I can't deny it.

Dahl's books for children are phenomenally successful in this country; a kind of dry, larger-than-life misanthropy comes through in most of books, along with some moralizing, that tends to exclusively take the child's side. He is a very skilled writer, and adapts his book with pretty much all of the black humour and colourful anarchy intact.Yes, some musical sequences are a trifle stilted; \"Cheer Up Charlie\" just doesn't work in any satisfactory way. In very much a 60s-early 70s musical way, Bricusse and Newley's \"Candy Man\" and \"Imagination\" work, but are not especially brilliant, or enhancing. The Oompa Lumpas' songs and Veruca Salt's precocious, petulant number are pretty good, mind, and really develop the film's moral basis.Set design is truly the strength of the film, appealingly and at times surreally visualizing the Chocolate Factory. Of course, Gene Wilder is the other coup d'etat of the production; coming over as a maniacal, wondrous and deadpan presence. Much of the appeal this film holds for older viewers has to go down to Wilder's wonderfully pitched Wonka: he really defines the part and defies one to think of anyone else in it. Julie Dawn Cole is the most impressive of the juvenile actors; coming over as the ultimate petulant, nigh-on demonic brat of a child. Her comeuppance is lovingly signposted in her musical sequence and then the dispatching. Each child who fails the test is amusingly and quite disturbingly dispatched by a diffident, sardonic Wonka, and then we are given quite sublime little epigrammatic songs by the Oompa Lumpas stating the moral. Some heady stuff for a children's film - \"Who's to blame?\"/\"It's the MOTHER AND THE FATHER!\"\nSome eccentric aspects of the book become a little odd on film, like the whole family set-up of the Buckets. Grandpa Joe, as enacted in the flesh, comes across as an increasingly questionable figure - his past laziness seems incorrigibly absurd, and he's seen to touch up some other female attendant of one of the children, when they are in a lift - \"What are you doing?!\" she says. Very curious stuff! Charlie is a simpering bland child who I suppose will do; really it's what you'd expect in a story which has to portray a quite simple idea of virtue and goodness. His being a blue-eyed Aryan child and Grandpa Joe and the rest of the lethargic family being quite obvious American Jews is slightly singular. The setting of the film is another thing; where is Wonka's factory and where does this American Bucket family live? The direction, by Mel Stuart, is maybe at times pedestrian... this is an area where maybe things could have been furthered, but it's an inoffensive, acceptable direction of the film really.As sure as Alastair Cooke being on the BBC, I liked this film. I can find few flaws as to its achieving what it sets out to do. The original book and concept maybe has its flaws to an older viewer, but it's damn well delicious stuff for any child, and there are too few films of which you can say that. The set designers and Gene Wilder really deserve bounteous praise for great efforts which lift the whole thing to its quality.Rating:- ****/*****",

            "content": "I have loved this film since childhood, and like all good films that children like, it has stood up to the well-earned cynicism of my adulthood. That is of course because it is good on binary levels; that of a beloved kid's movie and a sentimental disportment for adults.  That is why it is not only endearing, but enduring.An entertaining mix of irony, camp and charm, it is made of the stuff that produces dreams in the young and a longing for insouciance for the old.  Who could resist this fantasy world within the walls of that enigmatic candy factory where the wallpaper is edible and rivers flow with chocolate?   Who could not hum along with the crafty music numbers (mega kudos to songwriters Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley)?  And of course who could not love the homunculin Oompa Loompas?   The child actors/actresses are great.  They serve to provide a certain satisfaction to the audience because in truth there is a reticent schadenfreude in seeing bratty kids get a comeuppance or two.   And not enough can be said about Gene Wilder.  He is brilliant in this role that has a underlying Oscar Wilde wit to it.  In fact his appearance is a demarcated turning point in the movie in both tone and irony.  I'm not sure who else could have pulled off this unique mix of lovability and acidulousness.",

The cast is much better than the remake. Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka is more of a favourable character than Johnny Depp's and Granpa Joe will keep a smile on your face. The special effects were top of the range back in the 70's and they have had influence on a number of other films (especially the shrinking of Mike Teevee. Everyone's favourite character of the film is Wonka himself, who is a quirky character but seems to be hiding something. Charlie has to be the second (if not joint first) favourite character with his innocence and correct morals (even if some people don't like that he decided to buy chocolate instead of giving it to his family (but those people are just being pedantic), besides he does give some of the money to them). Then there is Grandpa Joe, who is enlightened and re-energised by Charlie. There are also four other children who everyone loves to see get what they deserve. And then there is the small, but wonderful Oompa-Loompas that give the feel of Oompa-Land. All I can say to sum up is that the film is full of great music, it is enjoyable for all the family and it is a film of Pure Imagination.",

            "review_title": "40 years later, still a delightful classic",
            "content": "I rewatched this movie a few nights ago for the first time in almost 10 years, and I'm surprised of just how well it holds up. Sure it's dated and it's not as impressive now as it was back then, but I love how this is entire film is practical and we're able to pull of some very nice set design and interesting looking props and sequences.The thing that holds up the most is the writing and characters. Though the movie doesn't follow the book exactly to a tee, I kind of like it better that way. An adaptation doesn't need to be an 100% carbon copy of the source material to be accepted as good. The Lord of the Rings movies had some minor changes to the story every now and then, but most fans didn't mind or actually applauded the changes. Funnily enough, the 2005 Tim Burton adaptation tried to be closer to the Ronald Dahl book and was rated slightly lower for it, though it's not a bad film.I like how they made Charlie a good hearted but still fallible young boy who still has a weakness of being tempted and even possibly falling into greed (though he never fully does) compared to Freddie Higmore's character in the Burton film who acts like a little messiah who can do no wrong, which always felt off.Of cours I have to talk about the star of the show, Willy Wonka himself. Gene Wilder was the perfect choice for the character and basically steals the movie for all the time he has on screen. He has the wonder of a child, but the wisdom, wit and professionalism of an adult. I love how all the parents in the film think he's a crooked and terrible man who doesn't care about what happens to the children, but he obviously does and knows that none of them will come to any real harm. He's amazing and often very funny.One thing I never truly understood as kid was the films ending, but now that I saw it recently, I think I finally do. I will be spoiling the end of this film so if you haven't seen it, I advise you stop reading and go watch it yourself.Wonka's final test to Charlie always seemed very jarring to me and can be taken as cruel, the way he shout at both Grandpa Joe and him is pretty callous, since they never actually stole the fizzy lifting drinks. It was simply a test of overcoming the temptation of greed where Charlie has to be courageous enough to give the gobstopper back to Wonka that he would have given to \"Slugworth\" for the cash prize, and since Charlie is poor along with his family, this would be extremely tempting for him. Though Charlie doesn't do this, he resists the temptation in exchange for a good deed to Wonka that he now trusts.A lot of people probably have imagined what would have happened if Charlie gave the gobstopper to \"Slugworth\" himself. I'm pretty sure what would've happened is that Charlie and his family would have gotten a cash prize that would have benifited them. He wouldn't have walked away with nothing, but he would've never known about the possibility of winning the factory itself.Anyway that's my opinion of this great film and my understanding of the message behind it and the entire test that the factory tour was based around. Except for the scary tunnel scene, I still have no idea what the hell that's supposed to mean.",

I love it more now, than when I was a kid.The best thing about this movie is that it not only pioneered but nailed - and I mean, absolutely NAILED - the concept of appealing to kids on one level, adults on a completely different level. This is one of the hardest things to do in movies, but if done well is an absolute delight. Kids can watch this movie and be enthralled by the Oompa-Loompas and the spectacle and the effects. Adults can be tickled by the smart, snappy dialogue and by Gene Wilder being a sarcastic wiseacre throughout, in what must be considered the role of his career.All the parts were nailed. You can't imagine anyone else in the roles as they were cast. You hated Veruca because she was just so spoiled. You winced at Mike TeeVee's, Augustus's and Violet's fatal flaws. Especially juxtaposed against this motley crew, you appreciated Charlie Bucket and his Grandpa Joe for their earnestness and unpretentiousness all the more. Truly they were the moral center of the piece.Other movies and shows have done a good job of appealing to both kids and adults on different levels, but this is the gold standard to which all must ultimately answer to.See it. And if you've seen it already, see it again.10/10.",

Two classics (\"Candy Man\", \"Pure Imagination\");  two good songs (\"I Want it Now\" and \"I've Got a Golden Ticket\").  Unfortunately, what it needs is an \"11 o'clocker\" -- a song closer to the finale that lifts the mood.  A little patter song by Willy Wonka, perhaps, about the loss of the children.  In the second act, after \"Pure Imagination\", \"I Want it Now\" is all we have except the wearisome Oompa-Loompa song.Gene Wilder is a marvel.  It was dangerous using an actor not so well known and not bringing him in for forty minutes of building him up.  He doesn't disappoint at all.  He captures Willy so perfectly one is surprised, re-reading to book, to find Wonka is short.The children are actually quite good, too, especially the ones playing Charlie and Veruca.",

            "content": "Calling a movie your all time favorite is quite a task. I believe I was around seven years old when I first watched Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Ever since that first viewing, I have been in love with the film and its incredible diegesis. Though the film all together is a wonderful timeless piece, for the purpose of my review I want to start when the winners of the golden tickets enter the factory with their parents. As they travel along the many rooms, corridors, tunnels, and halls of the factory, the viewer learns more about each individual child and, more importantly, what is characteristically wrong with them and their parents. Though Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory captures the viewer through Gene Wilder's quirky character and the sensory delightfulness of the factory, one of the most important things the viewer takes away from this film are morals. More specifically, to be polite, selfless, kind, respectful\u0085 everything that our parents are suppose to teach us and are deemed desirable by society. What makes this message so universal is the fact that not only is it meant for children but adults as well. The viewer learns these \"lessons\" from all of the children as well as their parents, who are partly if not entirely to blame for their behavior. The first child to be taken away is Augustus Gloop, a fat little boy who falls into the chocolate river. Even though Willy Wonka tells Augustus to stay away from the river, the boy is disobedient and even falls in and gets sucked up into a pipe. His fault is gluttony. Three other children all share similar fates, all representing an imperfection in society. The second child, Veruca Salt, is terribly spoiled by her father and demands to have one of the golden egg laying geese inside the factory. She attempts to get one and is deemed a \"bad egg\" and sent down a chute, followed by her father. She is, of course, greed. The two other children personify stubbornness and rudeness and are both punished for it; one by becoming a human blueberry, the other, turned into a micro-sized version of himself. The protagonist of the film, Charlie, is the only child left at the end of the factory tour. However, since he is only human, him and his grandfather (the only respectable parental figure besides, perhaps, Wonka himself) drink a fizzy soda that makes the both of them float up to the ceiling. Unlike the other participants, their predicament is only temporary. Even so, Willy Wonka is displeased with them and tells them to leave. Being obedient, regretful, and respectful, they exit the factory. Only through their act of humility does Wonka present them with the ultimate prize, the factory itself. This sends an obvious message to the viewer of what attributes are right and which ones are wrong.It was only recently that I realized Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was made in 1971. I knew it was an old movie, but I was shocked to find out it is over forty years old. Once the characters enter the factory, time seems to stop. There is nothing dated in the factory, save for the television, and the characters themselves don't necessarily give away a time period. These elements, along with the very universal message the film is sending, make it sincerely timeless. People in twenty years from today can watch this movie and still take away from it, young and old.",

This ticket allows him and a parent to enter the Chocolate Factory owned by Willy Wonka. There, we get something similar to a horror film-children are picked of one by one. Why? Because they are bad children.I enjoyed this film, but I can't see why so many people like it. I thought the music was fantastic (ecspecially the \"I got a Golden Ticket\" song.) I thought it also had some good jokes, but I forgot what they were.My only guess is that this-and the fact that it may be heart-warming to some is why people like it. For me, it was too weird and kind of overdid it. \"Being John Malcovich\" had a style of inventiveness, but this just seemed like many other films being called original; It's an adventure film with weird things that often appear.I enjoyed it, but I never found it heart-warming.Fans of this will like \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952) and possibly \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\" (2005) Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",

            "content": "Viewing Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory as a child and as a young adult I appreciated it's whimsical appearance and it's fantastic story. Not until recently did I discover the religious symbolism that runs throughout the film. I've never read the book which the film was based upon so I can't say if there are any similarities regarding religious symbolism in the book. The Religious spin: Wonka represents God The Chocolate factory represents Heaven or Eden Slugworth represents the Devil The everlasting gobstopper represents the soul The story essentially tells the tale of how mankind is offered the opportunity (the golden ticket) to reap Heaven (Chocolate factory). The opportunities are few in a world littered with corruption. The adults of the world are portrayed as cynical, untrusting or untrustworthy. The golden tickets find their way into the hands of children. Charlie, the protagonist of the story, is shown to be the kindest and most humble. Upon receiving their tickets the children are immediately confronted by Slugworth (the Devil) who whispers temptation into their ears. The first impression we are provided of the reclusive Wonka (God) is that of a prankster, as he shyly limps out only to tumble forward evoking both shock and delight. Throughout the film the Wonka character expresses a gamut of emotions to the point of knowing what he is like but not understanding him. He's both structured and chaotic. Upon entering the factory the guests are provided rules (some visible while others are practically invisible). The guests are instructed to sign that they will obey the rules (Symbolic of Adam and Eve). During the story each of the children fall prey to a number of the deadly sins; Augustus (gluttony), Veruca (greed), Violet (envy/vanity), Charlie (envy), and Mike (vanity). In each case the sin brings shame and disastrous results. One of the most famous quotable lines from the film is the Wonka statement,'We are the music makers. We are the dreamers of dreams'. Wonka (God) is stating 1. The relationship between He (God) and his guests (humans) exists when expressing We and that they each share the ability to create. And, 2. that the infinite is possible. With Wonka (God) all things are possible.Throughout the story appear the Oompa Loompas (Angels) who do the bidding of Wonka and provide sage advice for those who've fallen prey to sin. At one point in the story the children are each offered Wonka's greatest invention, the Everlasting Gobstopper. He informs them that this special treat will last forever and instructs them that it can never land in the hands of Slugworth (Devil). The children and their parents eye one another expressing their understanding of it's significance and of Slugworth's desire for it. In the end only Charlie and his Uncle remain at the conclusion of the tour. Wonka shows them the door and turns away to go about his business. Confused, they inquire about the chocolate and they're rebuffed by Wonka who scolds them for disobeying the rules. At this point Wonka (God) appears cold and distant. Charlie's Uncle, experienced to the corruption of the world (and victim of his own slothfulness), suggests to Charlie that they deal with Slugworth. Unswayed, Charlie, expressing remorse for his actions, offers the Everlasting Gobstopper (Soul) back to Wonka. Wonka turns to Charlie with a look of gratefulness and forgiveness. He tells Charlie that he did it. He passed the test. He returned the Gobstopper without letting it fall into the hands of Slugworth. Moments later, Slugworth enters the room. At first Charlie and his Uncle are taken aback by his presence, but, they are informed that Slugworth actually works for Wonka. The ominous presence previously embodied by Slugworth dissolves as he provides them with a congratulatory smile. In the final climax Charlie, having received the Chocolate Factory, takes a ride with Wonka up into the heavens. Much can be derived from the symbolic nature of the film and what it potentially is suggesting. Most notably the idea that the Devil actually works for God for the purpose of providing man with temptation in order to test his/her trustworthiness. To some that conclusion might appear to place man at a disadvantage. But, certainly not more so than what original man (Adam and Eve) had to face. Mankind still has free will. The Slugworth character (Devil) can be perceived much the same as a tool, albeit a dangerous one. A tool that enables men to act out poor choices. Similar to the adage that guns don't kill people, people kill people. The tool in the wrong hands can be a dangerous weapon but if it's ignored it's harmless. What I found most satisfactory about the potential symbolic nature of the film was that beneath it's whimsical appearance and fantastic story lie a moralistic teaching. It is a story meant to be seen by children and beyond entertaining them provide them lessons (some visible and some practically invisible) on how they should conduct themselves. And, potentially save themselves. I don't suspect that the soon to be released remake, directed by Tim Burton, will provide such lessons. The last and most intriguing question that I have regarding the Religious spin of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory is by who's design does it occur. Was it the author of the book? The screenwriter? The director? Or, by some other providence??",

Now that I'm older, I see that the \"children's\" movie has some devilish hints to it.  Such quotes as \"Candy is Dandy, but Liquor is Quicker\" and \"Well, the furnace only lights every other day, so they might survive\"made me wonder if Willy Wonka *really* liked kids.  Personally, I didn't like the Oompa Loompas either.  THEIR basic message is that if children don't behave, they should be disposed of.  Now, isn't that a bit mean-spirited for this kind of movie?  What's going on here?  Makes you wonder just what happened to all those children taken away by the Oompa Loompas.  Maybe that's just Gene Wilder humor, but if it is, then he shouldn't have been cast for this innocent, child-loving role.  No matter.  Despite all this, it's a fun movie and I liked the Grandpa.",

A boy from a poor family wins the big prize touring probably one of the most interesting and exciting fictional factories man would have ever known.

Paradise awaits!I really enjoyed the simplicity (not too many different sets, well chosen on-location settings (Munich has some great places!) and - from today's view' -seemingly 'low budget' ideas... that pretty much convey the message.I felt right in 'Alice in Wonderland' and believe many other artists adapted pieces of the set (and sweets design)... how about the Weasley Brothers from Harry Potter? And (earlier and recent) costumes of DC's Joker had some significant similarities, wether by accident or not.I really do enjoy the way it skillfully blends entertainment and a serious underlying moral, even if Roald Dahl did not love the movie adaptation of his (very genius!) story... This movie is for kids and grown-ups and conveys still the same things to both of them. Don't get greedy or all the other things and good things will be handed to you! (and other things)It is really a must see, a fairy tale made in the 70s with other technology than today - simple tools, massive outcome.

            "content": "I'm gonna be 100% honest. I usually only a give 10/10 rating when a movie is close to being perfect, when it does everything right. This is not the case with Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, a movie that is flawed, indeed. But the movie is incredibly original, it has a magical feel that I'm not sure many other movies have and has become a part of film and culture in general, that the movie deserves a 10/10 rating.Let's talk about the flaws of the movie first. I understand the film is based on a children's book, but the characters in the film, particularly the parents of the children feel incredibly clich\u00e9d and extreme in their way of being. Veruca's father, for example: he's a rich guy who gives his daughter absolutely anything she wants. And by anything I mean anything. He's at an extreme with his personality and so are all the other parents and their children. I get that this helps transmit an important message the film tries to send out: that some children are spoiled little brats, but the reality is that they are only a reflection of their own parents, I get it. But I think they could have made it more subtle and not so much \"in your face\" like in this movie. But that's pretty much it as a movie \"flaw\", but it takes a great part in the movie.Flaws aside, this movie is wonderful. It still looks amazing after nearly 45 years, the humor still holds up and it's just original as hell. Gene Wilder gives an iconic, hilarious performance that will NEVER be topped. Everything from the chocolate room with the chocolate river to the amazing songs in the movie feel magical. Another thing I love about this movie is the themes it handles. Like I mentioned earlier one of them is the raising kids to be spoiled brats theme and also what it means to be humble, like Charlie. The movie is so bizarre and even really scary at times, it is great.An amazing film, even if it has its flaws, they do not hide the fact that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a film like no other and is, without a doubt, a classic.",

I loved all the characters and their respective fates. I also loved the lickable wallpaper and wanted some just like it. This movie is total nostalgia for me, once I get started talking about it, I just go on and on, as you guys have already noticed. I can't get bored with it!

Roald Dahl who wrote the original novel hated this movie, calling it \"crummy\", he didn't like all the changes to the script and disliked the casts. I also found this better than the 2005 remake. Gene Wilder plays the quirky Wonka as he moralizes and cruelly punishes the little brats for their negative behaviors. Speaking of which, Wilder was not the first choice to play Wonka and he fits the mysterious character well. The song \"Pure Imagination\" has become a classic song and it has benefited my childhood and my love for candy.

Some time later, I took the book to school and my teacher (second, third, fourth grade? I can no longer recall which year) read it to the class, bit by bit.\nWhen I saw the movie later, it seemed only a natural extension of the book. Both have remained favorites of mine. Although I have not read the book in at least 25 years, the movie is still very  enjoyable to me.I won't give a full-fledged review/analysis like I normally do. Suffice to say, it is still a classic. The cast is great, from veterans like Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson and Roy Kinnear, to the interesting group of child actors. Only Julie Dawn Cole (Veruca Salt) would go on to post anything that remotely resembled an acting career. Most never stood in front of a camera again, including the star, Peter Ostrum (Charlie), now a vet. Yet, considering the tragic lives of many child stars, this is certainly no unhappy ending for the kids. They each made their only film appearance a good one. The Oompa  Loompas were wonderful and had the best musical numbers in the movie. And, of course, the movie and book taught some lessons to parents and children, such as: don't be greedy, avoid nasty habits, don't spoil your kids, and don't fry your brain watching TV.The choice of Wilder to play Wonka was perfect. With the possible exception of Victor Frankenstein (FRONKenSTEEN), this WAS Wilder's role. He captures all the nuances that come with a Roald Dahl character and is charming in his little asides of Mr. Salt (Kinnear), Mrs. Tevee (Alice Ghostly clone  Dodo Denney) and others. The myriad of literary quotes added to Dahl's screenplay later lend a wonderfully detached, Alice in Wonderland feel to the film. When the Dahl in Wonka comes out (in the `cures' for the children who fell into mischief in the factory, etc.), it seems merely an extension of the bizarreness, rather than anything cruel. (Hope that's no spoiler!)Of course the nonsense language-again, a throwback to Alice in Wonderland-helps to promote this surreal feel, too, and results in some cute lines, like Grandpa Joe (Albertson)'s `If SHE'S a lady, I'M a vernicious kanid!'This is another of the great 1960s-early 1970s children's movies. Of course, as I've said in over reviews, I am a child of that era, and probably prejudiced. A child of ANY era (and an child at heart of any age) would love Willy Wonka, though. I hope watching Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory makes you go right out and read this review. WAIT! Strike that! Reverse it!",

Akin to those identity-stealing `educational' (read: propaganda) shorts, they teach you that everything you do is wrong and you are only slightly LESS wrong by denying individuality.  One can only guess the true intent.Were the children cast as more villainous characters, one could almost rationally excuse and/or condone their ghastly fates.  But they were mainly just being kids with their typical personality quirks, which many of which grow out of with proper care.  And the so-called `hero' of the story is no less a meddlesome troublemaker, by the standards set by the other children, as illustrated in the bubble room.The lessons learned...?  No children can resist sin, and all of them are evil?  Affluence is evil?  Only poor kids are worthy of a second chance? Evil masquerades in bright colors, and sings funny songs?  Candy is bad?And that's just the underlying barely-subliminal wrong-messages (I didn't even touch the possible Freudian suggestions).  Some OBVIOUS red flags should be the glorification of an unchecked crazed despotic slave driver with Svengali-like control over children and the media, breaking the laws of nature and physics (and probably many other laws), housing a small personal army, and endangering children in hopes of finding an heir.Good grief, is there a SINGLE positive message?Most other children's movies and shows are drivel, but are far less harmless.  I wouldn't recommend this for ANY children you hope to grow up well adjusted.  I DO, however, recommend adults to watch this.  It's either a work of twisted-genius, or just a really bad kids movie.

Anyway, I should forgive myself because I am not living in the western world. I don't realize that the movie still attracts attention after all those years.The film was produced when I was two. Memory is something interesting, if it does not betray me, I should have seen it in 1975 or 1976 on TV in black and white. At that time, not many Hong Kong Chinese families could afford a colour TV. The Cantonese voice-over was done by a big team of talents voice professionals, one of them, a veteran, is named \"Tam Ping Man\".Vaguely the show left joyful feeling in my heart, that's the only thing I still keep. I didn't who know who Roald Dahl + Gene Wilder were (even I have watched \"The Woman in Red\" in 1984, I still didn't remember he was the eccentric owner of the chocolate factory). Then, around 20 years later in 1993, when David Tang of the world famous Shanghai Tang recommended this book for a local radio channel as one of the ten best books of that year, I suddenly recalled some scenes which matched his description. Everything then demystified.What was so powerful about this movie that I, who was only six or seven when I saw it for the first and only time, would keep those scenes in my mind? The success can be attributed to the luck Charlie Bucket got, the magic that his bedded grandparents suddenly could walk, the razzle-dazzle of the happy scenes with somersaults, delicious sweet chocolate and the happy young faces. No one can deny these elements attract not only young hearts but also the mature ones.I don't have any intention to see this old production again yet I am looking forward to the one which scheduled to be released in 2005 bearing exactly the same title of the book. Those were the kid days and it's gone, nostalgia is momentary, pressing forward is eternal.",

Oh, and some of the naffer musical numbers.\nBut, I realise that without this, they would never have got away with making the film. Look deeper, and you see the dark, satirical, hallucogenic fantasy world with no small amount of social commentary, a healthy dose of cynicism and - it has to be said - overtones of paedophilia, almost in the same vein as William Blake's Innocence/Experience poems.This will easily delight an audience of children or the elderly, and will hold their attention but the rest of us can see beyond the healthy family stuff, and watch this film for sheer escapsism value.Notice for example Gene Wilder's portrayal of the eccentric recluse - the beguiling stranger that kids are told never to talk to - and Julie Dawn Cole as spoiled brat verging on seductress. It's not just about interpretation either, I'm sure the film-makers knew exactly what they were doing.The morality tale that was at the core of Roald Dahl's novel is merely there to take the curse of an experimental and enjoyable film: take from it what you will.",

It's interesting how a movie where the kids are from the Post World War 2 Baby Boom Generation, can appeal to the kids of the next generations. Comparing this film to the 2005 version, I only saw the 2005 version once. While the 2005 version seems to add more to the book, I liked this one better. I liked the kids better in the 2005 version as they're kids from my generation. However, while watching the 2005 version I felt like it looked less realistic, the chocolate and scenery being from special effects, and the factory in the 2005 version looked so unrealistically huge. Watching this 1971 one, the way they show the factory looks more like a realistic Willy Wonka's factory than the 2005 one, even the scenery around the factory and gadgets. The 2005 one seemed more like entering a fictional virtual world from how I remember it. Also, I think Gene Wilder plays a more realistic version of Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp. The characters in this one also seem more realistic than the characters in the 2005 version. This movie often times frequently has references from it, like I frequently see pictures online of Willy Wonka during the Everlasting Gobstopper scene with some message. So, this movie has stood the test of time. While it's been awhile since I've seen it, I still think of it as an enjoyable movie to watch and I feel like everybody deserves to see Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory at least once.",

However, I was raised on Disney movies and the like, not the horror movies \"Willy Wonka\" has been compared to, and I still liked it, so I wouldn't say it's unsafe for all kids to see.

The scenes with the Wonka-obsessed adults I thought were presented in a way that was hard for children to understand. I felt like I was watching an adult movie. I have to say this for the book: it did a better job in that department. If anything, this movie wasn't a very good adaptation. Plus, I thought it was a little out-of-character when Wonka blew up at Charlie and his grandpa. That was another element I thought was too grown-up. However, this movie has its winning points. I'm glad that unlike the book, the kids brought one parent each instead of both of them. That makes for less crowding. I also like how they added in Slugworth and his everlasting gobstopper test. All in all, this is just an OK movie. Its atmosphere was just a little too bizarre for my taste. It's still better than the book and mildly enjoyable to watch.",

Even if I didn't read the original Roald Dahl book, it did not feel like the book this movie was based on.It's just a feature length commercial for Wonka candies. No wonder Roald Dahl hated the movie. It was such an insult to his hit book, it received poor reviews upon its release, and bombed at the box office for good reason. The writing is too play it safe. The acting (even with such talent) is dry. The sets are fake. The chocolate river isn't even real chocolate. Slugworth isn't needed. The fizzy lifting drinks are wasted and unnecessary. And while most of the songs are fine on their own, they don't fit the Roald Dahl tone of the story.The Oompah Loompah song got very annoying after four times. I'm sure it's not as bad as the version with Tom and Jerry, but I didn't laugh once at this movie. Not to mention that the characters in the movie are poorly written. I honestly prefer the Tim Burton version of the movie, because it's a lot closer to the original book than this.",

In this case, it's true: by providing more detailed anecdotes expressive of Willy Wonka's encyclopedic knowledge base and earth-shattering sense of humor, the book scores eleven whilst the movie scored only ten. We all know how talented Wilder is--particularly, when he writes, not only when he acts, witness the astonishing creativity of \"Young Frankenstein.\" This movie provided a vehicle for Wilder to sing, dance, jest, wisecrack, and even display the rare dramatic moment, typically centered around the emotion of love (even when seemingly busting on some child's self-imposed torment, e.g., blowing up like a blueberry or being micro-miniaturized during electromagnetic transport). Even Jack Albertson got a chance to sing and dance, but--as you may not have been aware--there was a time when a (young) Jack Albertson was nationally renowned as a soft-shoe dancer and vaudevillian. I frankly think that Charlie could have been better cast in a less humdrum figure than Peter Ostrum: certainly, he did not rise to the level of brilliant characterization that we discern in, say, Mike Teevee or Veruca Salt (BTW, quite apropos, as 'verruca' is Latin for 'wart'). This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Plus, the occasional quotes from classic English writers are immortal: \"We are the music-makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams,\" or perhaps, \"Where is fancy bred? // In the heart, or in the head?\" Bravo, Gene!",

            "content": "This film-along with the book, and the others also by Roald Dahl-was my obsession when I was in second grade. Dahl himself described his success as a children's storyteller by saying he \"sided with children against adults\", and perhaps that is why I loved it so much at an age when I was very angry at most of the adults in my life. (Though in retrospect, perhaps reading comprehension wasn't my strength-I embodied all the negative characteristics of the four \"bad\" kids in one package!).The film's story is directed and told with simplicity, which is how it should be. Even the ending that differs from the book suits the material in a way that is unique to cinema. Unlike modern-day films, the special effects necessary to create the illusions in the film are kept at a minimum, which leads us to view them not as special effects, but as \"real\" events, no matter how fantastic (compare the famous \"big blueberry\" scene in this film with its counterpart in the Tim Burton version, and you'll see what I mean).The protagonist, Charlie (Peter Ostrum) is not given a whole lot to do in any version of this story, especially when compared with Wonka himself (the late, great Gene Wilder in his best performance) and the other kids, but this allows us to project and imagine ourselves as Charlie, and thus the story is stronger for it. Among the kids, the standout character in both the book and the film is Veruca Salt, played by Julie Dawn Cole, and she is a certifiable scene thief indeed. Now, I have had this film memorized for close to twenty-five years, but every time she makes demands of her \"daddy\" (Roy Kinnear), I can't stop cracking up, just as I did when I was eight.The music is also wonderful, though not entirely true to the tone of Dahl's book-however, the film compensates for it. \"Pure Imagination\" in particular is beautiful, especially in how the scene is staged. In a more typical musical, the song would've been treated as a bravura show-stopper that would've detracted from whatever sense of reality the film would've conveyed up to that point. Instead, the scene is underplayed, allowing the melody to set the stage for the scene without overpowering it. The pauses between lines allow for some delicious character details for both Wonka and the kids, not interrupting the momentum at all as it might seem. The slow pace of the song floods us with the mood intended. (I understand Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, the authors of the music, were opposed to this interpretation of the song-ironic, given how this turned out to be one of the most memorable scenes in the film).Most films from my childhood, I can look back on with some distance and say \"Yeah, the film itself isn't that great, but the memories of watching it color it for me so that I can still kinda see it as I did then\". Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is an exception-when I reviewed it last night for the purpose of writing about it, it had the same power on me that it did when I first saw it in 1994.I'll end on an unusual sidenote of the dual nature of the screenplay. The first time I heard the opera \"The Marriage of Figaro\" by Mozart, the very first thing I noticed was that the opening notes of the overture were, in fact, the notes played by Wonka to open the \"musical lock\" on the Chocolate Room door in this film, and I couldn't help but giggle. \"Rachmaninoff,\" says Mrs. Teavee in the scene, incorrectly. The film assumes that we know she is wrong, thus assuming the best about the viewer-much more than it would've had a more familiar melody been used. And that, truly, is the most valuable thing about the film-it approaches the audience as if it is intelligent, perhaps more than it should...",

Charlie doesn't get away with stealing fizzy lifting drinks, as was suggested by another user, but rather makes up for it by returning the Everlasting Gobstopper, and that's why he gets the factory in the end. The Oompa-Loompa songs still get stuck in your head for days after, and the kids do a very good job of playing kids, who can be, to quote Hobbes, \"nasty, brutish, and short.\" Do yourself a favour and see this movie. I hear a remake is in the pipeline with Nicolas Cage as Wonka. Somebody'd better hurry up and correct this error before principal photography begins; it's not that I have anything against Cage, but he's totally wrong for the part. Better to do a remake that hews more closely to the book and cast someone like Rowan Atkinson as Wonka. He's supposed to be an odd little man, not a brooding action hero. The other frightening possibility is Will Smith, who again is totally wrong for almost the same reason. Unless you're going to do it right, don't bother.",

The music was nominated for an Oscar in 1972. Gene Wilder was nominated for Best Actor in the 1972 Golden Globes. Today, the movie is a cult classic. The special effects are odd, but fun for 1971. The stories about the spoiled kids holds to true even today. Brilliant. Inventive, bizarre, over-the-top and still original. The remake got a ton of publicity, but never had the same charm of this truly original film. A+ for heart and creativity.",

Depending on who you are, this version's ultra-clarity could ruin it for you. And on the other hand the clarity can add to its charm. Some of the props look very amateurish and aren't modified or transformed enough to hide what it originally was. It's like going back to a N64 game and realising how terrible those hold up and don't match up to your memories, but the game could still be very fun.As for the movie, it's great, it's dark, Wilder is amazing as this ambivalent god within his factory. The songs hold up well, It's one of the few movies I can watch over and over again. I'm also in the camp, after watching the special features, that the ultra-clarity and the fact that you can tell they spray-painted cardboard in some scenes adds to the charm. Also, could be my favorite Gene Wilder movie. Though, I'm admittedly not well versed on his body of work. Saw blazing saddles loved it, but not much else of his. Definitely holds up.",

Forgive me, but this is political correctness run riot. Is Augustus pushed into the river? Is the gum forced into Violet's mouth? Is Veruca picked up and thrown bodily into the furnace? Of course not! All the awful things that happen to characters in this film are brought on by their own hideous behavior. It's an eternal truth: for every action, there is a consequence. Eat too much? You'll get fat. Drink too much? Alcoholism looms. And if you over-indulge your children, they will torment you until they're 18, then torture the rest of the world for the rest of their lives. The warnings in this film are similar to the ones seen in Grimm's fairy tales, and just as valid. This movie is not Walt Disney; it's much darker, more textured and, frankly, more interesting. So if you're the type who believes 'there's a little bit of good in everyone', don't watch this film. As one of Oscar Wilde's characters says, \"The good ended happily and the bad unhappily. That is what 'fiction' means.\"",

This is based on the Roald Dahl novel \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\" I first read the book when I was a child and some time later I watched the movie at school and, since I happen to not be a Dahl purist, I liked it. I also liked Tim Burton's more recent version, but I like this one better.Out of either Johnny Depp or Gene Wilder, I have to admit that Gene Wilder did a better job on capturing the character of Willy Wonka. I know this movie is like a mediocre version of Dahl's novel and failed upon its original release, but does a movie have to be perfect to the novel it's based on to be great, no matter how beloved the novel is (anyone apart from purists)? Seems not. But time has become kind to it to make it a beloved cult family classic. While Tim Burton's movie may have done a better job on the book, it is no way as good as this movie (well almost).I think this movie is what one of the songs in this movie describes it: Pure Imagination. It's a shame Roald Dahl despised this movie (because of the liberties this movie took), but it is quite imaginative, sweet and (in terms of chocolate) scrumdidilyumptious. The songs also made an impression on me too, including the aforementioned \"Pure Imagination.\" Your family would want to experience this minor classic over and over again and I would recommend it for anyone. If you're a purist, however, stick with Tim Burton's more recent adaptation. My rating: 10 out of 10.",

The songs are memorable, almost like Disney songs. Just those songs that everybody knows. The remake took a stake and jabbed it into my childhood. The sets are dated, but that makes them even cooler. The film has a pretty good supporting cast and added to the film, unlike the Buton version. Burton did a good job with his sets, but it hails in comparison to the original Wonka.",

            "content": "As I say, the book is always superior to its film. In this case, my philosophy proves correct. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory was a brilliant book with great characters. Willy Wonka, was personally my favourite character. He had an evil, twisted side to him. Quite cynical at times, and a very sadistic individual. \"My chocolate! My chocolate! Look what this child has done to my chocolate!\" Wonka shouted, as one of his guests began to drown in a pool of chocolate sauce.In the film, he proves very similar. Gene Wilder is the best part of the film, and there's no doubt about it. And there's no doubt that Charlie deserves a candy cane through the head. The film has bad actors (overall), a decent array of script and effect and um-pa f*****g lump-as. The um-pa lump-as ruin many aspects of the film, and everything seems too childish all the way through. The glittery music and bright presentation didn't impress Roald Dahl, and it didn't impress me.If you were to class this as a kid's movie (As it is) you'd rate this well and give it to your children for their enjoyment. But, don't expect too much. Wait until Tim Burton's adaptation is shown in the cinemas, and then make up your mind what's better.For other alternatives, I'd recommend something like Toy Story or the Lion King for your kids.",

Since I never read the book, I have no idea where the story took place but the on location filming in Munich, Germany gives the movie a surreal feel.  Maybe it was intended that way but I get the feeling that it was done for cost purposes.  Even as a kid, I remember feeling that it was \"foreign\".  You can tell the extras aren't Americans.  They have that stiff look of people who were simply hired as background.  The songs are pretty lame and sung terribly too.  And the cinematography is washed out.  All in all, it's not a pretty thing to look at.  BUT...there's a lot of invention going on here that today's films lack and despite the casting of Johnny Depp and Director Tim Burton, the remake will lack as well.  Sure it's cheap looking, but the film makers give it all they've got.  The one clear thing the elevates the movie is the cast.  Yes, Gene Wilder is great but it's the inspired child casting that makes the movie memorable.  As Veruca Salt, Julie Dawn Cole never loses her brattiness.  There's no attempt to ever soften her attitude and she's great throughout.  As much as people would like to think of her character as a cartoon, anyone with children like me knows there are kids who act in this same way.  And, like the movie says, it's the parent's fault.  Not that the movie's \"lessons\" are important. They're simplistic blather.  It's just that the casting is so memorable. It's the element that makes the movie so watchable.  I never got scared as a kid watching the \"boat scene\".  The scene that always bothered me was the one where Augustus Gloop got sucked up the pipe.

Thank goodness that Mel Stuart, the film's director, set everyone straight with his recently published book, \"Pure Imagination: The Making of 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'.\" According to Mel, his then 12-year-old daughter, who had read the Roald Dahl book, was the person who first suggested the idea for the film, and that her father take the idea to his then boss, producer/presenter David L. Wolper. After Mel did exactly that, Wolper in turn took the idea to executives at the Quaker Oats Company.\"Quaker Oats? That's not a studio, that's a food company,\" Mel told Dave. But that, oddly, was exactly why Quaker wanted to get into the movies to begin with: to promote a candy bar to be made by its then confectionery division. The irony: even when the Wonka movie was completed, Quaker never got around to manufacturing its proposed candy bar, let alone promoting it.Yes, the film was released in its original theatrical run by Pararmount, but the initial deal called for that studio to hold onto the U.S. distribution rights for seven years, at the end of which time said rights would revert back to Wolper Pictures, Limited and the Quaker Oats Company, who, after all, were the joint copyright holders of the film. Paramount was anxious to relieve itself of that 7-year deal anyway, and was therefore not willing to renew the terms of the deal. In 1977, David L. Wolper sold his namesake Organization to Warner Bros., at which point he then joined WB's Board of Directors, ultimately selling to Warners his own and Quaker Oats' 50% shares in the Wonka movie.The Stuart book explores the terms of the deal in greater detail than can be shared here; suffice to say, the incident shows us just how unwilling we sometimes are to get all the behind-the-scenes facts straight. It seems to me, friends, that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory in its 1971 version was a film reeking of sweetness and magic, yet created specifically as an infomercial for a candy bar that in the end was neither manufactured, marketed or distributed. Today, any movie with a candy bar as its centerpiece would not be burdened with such problems; movie dealmaking today is more covering every base than skipping certain loopholes.Besides, I think the Burton remake represents a perfect opportunity to celebrate and re-examine the Wonka legacy.

Back when the movie came out, the set looked fine enough for kids to enjoy, but with today's technology some of it does look sort of cheesy and cheap.  Gene Wilder is perfectly cast as Willy Wonka, the holed up genius responsible for the factory's success.  Wonka has personality and charm, but also backbiting humor.  He is looking for an unselfish child to run his factory one day. He puts every winning ticket child to the test by inviting them to visit his factory so he can see their true character and motives.  He sees right through people's selfish motives and the accidents they cause in his factory are all the children's doings (or undoings).As a child, I didn't pay a lot of attention to the message of the oompa lumpahs and spoiled bratty kids.  I wasn't allowed to watch much TV and we didn't have much money so that's probably why I didn't think they were singing to me.  Adults will get the message and appreciate it.  A movie about good kids finishing first is always uplifting.  Many baby boomers and generation x-ers look fondly back on the movie and the effects the fantasy had on their childhood.  My boyfriend never saw the movie and I know he wouldn't enjoy it as an adult (he particularly loves car chase movies). It's a movie that's best seen for the first time as a child.",

I haven't read any other reviews, however if any say this movie is not top of the line material, discount them immediately.To appreciate this movie you need to appreciate so much more than simply mindlessly watching television. It is immensely deep, and anyone who says otherwise is a nitwit. (see what I did there?)Naturally one can appreciate the movie for the sheer brilliant performance given by Gene Wilder. He is horrifically and terrifyingly BRILLIANT! Whether it is his ability to pull at the heartstrings of the audience from his sweet and innocent eyes, or his ability to pierce the very bottom of the audience's soul in pure terror and fright, he is amazing. He is definitely one of my favorite actors of all time. Some people claim that this movie is just plain weird, so be it. It is weird, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I love every last bit of this movie. I also read in the trivia listed here that Leonardo Di Caprio once claimed it was one of his favorite movies, so tell that to those naysayers. My favorite scene is most likely the boat scene. I LOVE IT. Wilder is so terrifying. That he can captivate so much fear, just WOW. There are not words to describe my feelings about this movie. Further, I love the random quotes throughout the movie. The one liners that Wilder throws about on whim throughout the movie are actually references to brilliant works of literature and poetry. He quotes Shakespeare and Arthur O'Shaughnessy, just to name a few. From this movie I also gained on of my favorite poems of all times, it was an Ode written by the latter from above. \"We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea breakers and sitting by desolate streams, world-losers and world- foresakers on whom the pale moon gleams, yet we are the movers and shakers, of the world forever, it seems.\" AHHHH. Wondrous. I actually have that portion of the poem memorized because I love it THAT much. Also, fun fact, if you want to creep people out hard core, take a lesson from old Willy himself. Memorize random quotes and such and then at random times stop whatever it is that you are doing and peer deeply into the eyes of someone around you. Then begin reciting what you have memorized. The reactions are hilarious. Something to look for in the movie which methinks is an anachronism can be seen right about the time when Charlie gets the golden ticket. There are actually several if you look hard. First, if you see the ads behind him when he is wandering about the outside of the candy store they are clearly not the era they are going for in the film. But what is most out of place is the man standing in blue jeans and a black shirt reading a newspaper. I don't know if he was mistakenly on set, if he was supposed to be there, or what. But it is worth noting and observing. All in all it is a great film. Good for children in that they don't truly understand everything about it. Cool for adults because they can see it on a deeper level. One final remark, why did no one ever notice the man with the huge slash across his face talking to their children? For all they knew he could have been whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But at the same time I think it was done for humour reasons. I like to think of Gene Wilder and his crew sort of being like Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jason Segel, James Franco, and that lot. They just represent different time periods. Word.",

He lives with his mum and four grandparents (of which he favours grandpa Joe) who have been in bed for 20 years. He lives in the same town as Willy Wonka's chocolate factory which hasn't been open for years. One day it was announced that Wonka will let 5 people in if they found the gold tickets. The first 4 were found by naughty greedy brats first Ourgust Gloop a greedy German boy then Vereca Salt a spoilt brat whose rich father forced his factory workers to unwrap Wonka bars till they found one. then Violet Beeruagard a gum chewer with bad manners then Mike Teevee a TV lover and a pain in the neck.Then the miracle happens Charlie finds a golden ticket and his dream comes true he and his grandpa Joe go to the factory.Oh dear then we meet Wonka a Weired seemingly friendly chocolate factory owner. though he dosen' care that Orgustus nearly drowns in his chocolate river or that violet turns into a blue berry by his dangerous products, then he doesn't cared that Vereca falls down the eggdicater or that mike Teevee shrunk by sending himself be television though all their parents were worried sick. In the end Charlie gets the chocolate factory because he was the only one left, which i was very pleased about but a definitely hate Wonka. But i was very impressed by Gene Wilders performance he played a great Wonka",

This is the Broadway representation of my generation, the 70s hippies who came of age after the original 60s hippies. Gene Wilder's Wonka adds the perfect smirk for the period. With more than a little bitterness and social conflicts in our laps and without a clue to address the worst of the issues (war, draft, racism etc.), a Let It Be philosophy was embraced. Hence, the birth of the post-modern smirk. This musical semi-farce was a preamble to the comedy farce which I regard as the bible of our (early 70s) generation: Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles, also starring Wilder. When Gene cynically over-amplifies, with that far-away Wonka gleam in his eye, `He's so strict,' that pretty well sums up the tongue in cheek humor of the hyper-liberal early 70s.

If you  for some reason did not see this movie, I urge you to do so.  It is such a pleasure to watch.  It really is a great movie.  Children and adults alike will enjoy it.  The music is good, too; who can't help but sing along with the oompa-loompas!!!  I own the soundtrack, VHS tape, DVD, and probably will end up getting the special edition 30th anniversary DVD also. This movie airs plenty on the Fox Family Network so if you are a bit weary over a certain part of the movie (which other reviews have touched upon) you can catch it on there since they cut out that scene completely, which is a shame because it really is a good scene.  Creepy yes, but me as a child was not affected by it and believe me I am the worst when it comes to that kind of stuff.  In fact, I never even noticed it til I was much older, and saw it 100 times (no exaggeration). Children will most likely be so absorbed in Gene Wilder's singing and the effects of the scene than the actual stuff going on in the background, but if you haven't seen it yet you can always watch it first.

Make sure you have a good color set, as the factory scenes feature arresting and riotous color changes.  You go from the brilliant flora of the candy-making room and the journey of the \"Wonkatania\" boat (\"she's tres jolie\") to the starkness of the \"candybar TV\" studio.Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the movie scary or too intense for viewing with my youngsters.  You just have to keep things in context and play along with the joke, because, as Willy says at the end, nobody is harmed and they remain their same old selves, selfish or kind, according to their nature.  Besides, someone as gentle and kindhearted as WW would not allow ill to befall his guests.I also liked the musical numbers.  The Oompah-Loompahs reminded me of the Munchkins (without females, at least as far as we are shown, so how do they keep the line going?) and their memorable lyrics and midget-choreographed routines.  Fans will recognize the wonderfully distinctive singing voice of composer Anthony Newley on the opening number (Candy Man), lip-synched nicely by actor Aubrey Woods as Bill the candy store proprietor.  And a nod goes to Gene Wilder for his rendition of Pure Imagination, although he struggles to hold the concluding note.  But, that's no big deal considering its a comedy actor doing a song.The child actors are quite good, with \"Charlie\" being the good-hearted poor boy, whose relationship to \"Grandpa Joe\" is touching.  Julie Dawn Cole is perfect as the nasty and selfish spoiled rich kid, and the others delightfully annoying and over-the-top in their own ways (\"Mike Teevee\", and \"Augustus Gloop\", come on!).Its a fun film and a visual treat.

The shameful war was still on in the far east. There was still a peace movement happening. Woodstock was fresh in the mind & opposite of what PBS tries to make it look like now, that concert was about peace. Much of the humor in our society was dark. Lyrics from innumerable songs were protesting the war machine & the criminal powers that be. This movie with Wilder and what people like to call a low budget, was very well suited for that time period. For those who say that this movie was sick and evil, it was a FANTASY! Life was serious then, as it still is, and people escape in various ways. I loved the movie, in spite of its imperfections; as if life is perfect.?. Veruca Salt was my love, at least I wanted her to be. \"And by the way...\" the movie is funny in most of the scenes. I was rolling in laughter then & even now. People of now who can't find humor in characters like eccentric & possibly perverted rich old men take life too seriously. Obviously, Wonka's a freaky old self-centered corporate leader. It's good for kids to see this so they can know what to avoid. The book is great. The movie is great, but they're different. I know this movie doesn't lead people to do what these FANTASY CHARACTERS do. I'm not happy with the politics of factories, rich owners, workers struggling to survive (slaves).

The movie is to enjoy like a kid for its whole shameless tone but without the cinematographic rigour that could rise the movie to a real artistic value.Newest Roald Dahls book adaptation is much more incisive and technically professional respecting Tim Burton direction but also it is much less winsome than Stuarts movie.

We all know the children are mean and spoiled, but they're constantly put in mortal danger by this man. I don't like them either dude, but they don't deserve to die! Jeez . . .I'd also say the mother's song \"Cheer Up, Charlie\" probably should have been left on the cutting room floor and nothing of value would have been lost.Other than that this movie is alot of fun. The director's background in documentary filmmaking really shows in the best possible way here. The world feels authentic even beyond how cartoonish it all is on the surface. Every scene leading up to the factory is like a short documentary piece about each child as they're interviewed by a news crew. It's not overstylized. It feels very \"matter of fact\".Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka is the standout here. He tows a fine line between eccentric weirdo and charming inventor. From the outset it's unclear what to expect from him. He walks out to the crowds outside his factory with a very visible limp and slowly makes his way to the gate. Everyone is holding their breath in dismay and suspension. Once he makes it to the end it's revealed to have been an illusion all along. He somersaults the last few steps and the crowd goes wild. He's not quite a charlatan, but rather a showmen. And that scene sets the tone for the rest of the film.I can't write this review without talking about how amazing the boat scene is though. That whole sequence was trippy as hell. I felt like I was spinning and spinning with the whole group.There's loads more I can say, like how good the child actors are, how consistently clever and funny the dialogue is, how great the visual gags are. But chances are you know all about that stuff. This movie is a classic, and for good reason. It's like stepping into some weirdo's colorful and sweet imagination.",

Yeah, him trying to find the ticket might be a somewhat tedious process, but the changing of scenes here and there keep you going, wanting to see more.

Out comes another great song/scene.\nThen, the Chocolate Factory itself...\nLet you imagination run wild!  \"Surprises around every corner but nothing dangerous!\".  The cast, man.  A great cast if ever one has seen one.  They all fit their part perfectly.  Violet was the least believable one, but even she was TOTALLY believable.  Get my point?  The song, the very first song sung by Willy Wonka, has to be the greatest movie song ever, and be the greatest scene ever, esp. what he does at the end of it. It's so cool, and you never expect it.  Any of it, through out the whole movie.  The monologue/song in the boat, the umpa loompas, the many, MANY changing expressions of Willy Wonka.    Man.  Gene Wilder was so great in this movie, words cannot describe him.  Want to just forget about everything?  Forget about your worries, your doubts(were have I heard that before), your fears? Just let it all go?  Then watch this movie.  Imagination can be a one's greatest tool in this fight called life, and it comes in one form \"Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory\".Describing how great this movie is and why would take forever. Just rest assured that if you ever hear about this movie coming on the TV or see it at a video store, that you can watch it, and then want to watch it again...and again...and again...",

            "content": "I'm not the first to say it, but the song \"Cheer Up, Charlie\" is horrible. It's painful to listen to, and when this movie was shown on TV while I was growing up, I always left the room when Charlie's mother sang it. It doesn't help that the song adds nothing to the film; every other song in the production gives us exposition or mood. \"Cheer Up, Charlie\" just makes it drag and tells us what we already know: Charlie's sad that he hasn't won a golden ticket. Thanks, Mom.Thanks to the magic of VHS and DVD, however, I haven't had to put up with that awful song for years. Now I can see the rest of a beautiful, funny, scary, magical film that I first saw at age 6 in 1971 (!) It truly is watchable again and again. Compare this to, say, \"E.T.\", which seemed good the first time I saw it and awful every time since.Gene Wilder is brilliantly cast and does an excellent job of playing an eccentric just-this-side-of-loony Willy Wonka. Jack Albertson also turns in an excellent performance, as do most of the child actors and parents, not to mention Mr. Turkentine, Charlie's teacher. Peter Ostrum (Charlie) does a fair job; his role is the deepest and most difficult to play of all the children and I can't fault him for not being a ten-year-old Robert DeNiro.Was I scared, age 6, watching the decapitation of a chicken? Sure, but for.. what, 3 seconds? The movie (save for \"Cheer Up, Charlie\") moves fairly quickly. Who has time to think about chicken butchering when there is exploding candy to be seen?Roald Dahl is famous for bizarre stories involving children and cruel or incapable parents/caretakers (\"James and the Giant Peach\", \"Matilda\"),  but he always puts the blame where it belongs and the deserving are rewarded. \"Willy Wonka\" is a worthy, if slightly different, adaptation of Dahl's book.I give the film a 9/10. Without \"Cheer Up, Charlie\", make it a 10.",

            "content": "This winter I went into a wave of nostalgia, and Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was the biggest thing from my childhood that I remembered and loved. This is undoubtably my most favorite movie of all time, forever. Despite all of the shallow comments by some saying this movie is 'horrible' and 'disturbing' I grew up on this movie and loved it. So did my friends, and my family. To this day if I go out and wear my shirt that has the Wonka logo on it (yes, there is one ^_^) I get a barrage of comments on how that's their favorite childhood movie. It remains a treasured childhood memory to this day for me as well. As a child, I was captivated by it's colorfulness, the thought of so much candy, and by the humorous characters. Today, I'm captivated by it's true depth and moral meaning, and the depth of the characters. The kids are hilarious because we can all relate to their faults and hate brats. Charlie is wonderful because we always root for the underdog. The Oompa Loompas are a subltly humorous and wise touch, and my all-time favorite, Willy Wonka, is a mix of charming and eccentric, funny yet sarcastic, and gentle yet harshly wise. To this day he remains my favorite and most inspirational movie character. Gene Wilder did a completely fantastic job as the eccentric candyman- they couldn't have picked a better person to display Wonka's wonderful wackiness. (\"If the good Lord had intended us to walk, he wouldn't have invented roller skates!\")All in all, definitely give this movie a try. I wholeheartedly agree with someone who wrote not to listen to the people who say this movie is 'bad' or 'disturbing.' I'm not bashing those who don't like the movie, but those who make ridiculous assumptions about it. This movie, despite it's little bits of intenseness does teach an important lesson on where greed will get you and what a kind-heart will ultimately win you- you just can't be too shallow with it or you'll miss it. (And no, the children don't die when they fall into their own traps. At the end Wonka assures Charlie that they'll be perfectly restored to their old selves, but perhaps a bit 'wiser for the wear.') When you watch, don't think too hard or criticize, just sit back and enjoy a trip through Pure Imagination!",

            "content": "Just to let you all know, for those of you who havent seen it (YET!) there are some discrepancies in what some people are saying and insinuating, I would know, I used to watch the movie EVERY DAY after school during highschool like some would watch sitcoms. (and to note for those who are WW guru's: I ALWAYS fast fwd thru Cheer Up Charlie! I have too! It's like this odd obsession! Like if I hear the second line of the song I'll melt... odd I know but a bad song!) haha, anyway, in the oompah loompah song where it says the parents are to blame, it refers to the type of child that is \"spoiled\" not troublesome, it's all about being spoiled and you can't say anything else in the world is to blame for that but the parents, even parents who do spoil their kids would admit that. In any case, to clarify the boat scene, there's a clip of someone having a black earthworm inch across under their nose and a clip of a chicken's head getting cut off, which if you look closely is either an already dead chicken or a fake one, and that's the only part that bothers me, other than the fact that willy wonka in this day and age would never touch Mike TV's head! It is a great movie with scene after scene of \"moral of the story\"s. There are some things I still have not gotten to this day so if anyone knows please post! (hopefully I'll find my way back to this site!) here are some: What is Willy Wonka saying in German before they enter the Lickable Wallpaper room? The french/latin and other ones are easy enough to roughly figure out but I'm totally lost on that one. Also, what was the point of going \"up and out\"? at the end? for effect? I never got that. anyway! enjoy your movie, you will not be disappointed unless you are highly critical and observant! and even if you do find something wrong with the movie as far as content for children (which you wont!) I doubt they'd pick up on it anyway! Have a good one everyone! ~Missy ;) PS: I named my cat Veruca (b/c she's a brat!) oh yeah, and you gotta LOVE the teacher in the movie!!! LMAO!!!",

So rent this movie today because it will have you laughing. I think Willy Wonka is the best movie made to have ever been seen on a movie screen.Willie Wonka has a few funny scenes in it. The first funny scene was when Augustus Gloop fell in the chocolate river and got stuck in the tube. Another funny scene was when Peter Guff got shrunk into a microscopic boy. The last funny scene was when Violet ate a piece of candy and turned into a blueberry.The next part of the movie was an action-packed part. Charlie got the golden ticket and everybody tried to get it from him. Willy Wonka freaked out when Charlie and his grandpa were the last ones left to finish the trip. The elevator scene was action-packed because you didn't know if they were going to have enough speed to break through the glass ceiling and fly.The third part of Willy Wonka was the scary part. Charlie and the rest of the people were on a boat going through a tunnel. They saw all those pictures pop up in front of them. It was pretty scary! The last scary part was when Mr. Slugworth kept following Charlie everywhere.The last part of the movie was the suspense part. The first suspense part was if that man was going to kill Charlie. The second part was when Charlie opens up the candy bar and there was not a gold ticket inside of it. The last suspense part was when Willy Wonka himself gave Charlie the chocolate factory for him to operate. So now Charlie owns the chocolate factory in the new movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.",

It was passed over when it was released in 1971, but showing it on television and releasing it into the home video market transformed it into one of the greatest family classics of all time.Gene Wilder, in his prime, plays the delightfully eccentric Wonka, who invites five children to visit his whimsical candy factory. But the adventure seems to be more of a test of everyone's fundamental honesty, and one by one, the children are eliminated from the tour, due to their odious behavior, until only the truly honest one remains.The movie boasts some wonderfully whimsical sets, and is brought to life by a host of marvelous performers, including character actors Jack Albertson and Roy Kinnear, not to mention the marvelous child actors (Julie Dawn Cole, who plays the fuming Veruca Salt, is so convincing, it's scary). Even the bit parts are classic, namely David Battley as the hilariously nonsensical school teacher. And the songs, written partly by Anthony Newley, are beautiful and reflect the fanciful mood of the picture.This is a classic in its greatest form, where honesty is rewarded, bad behavior is punished, and a golden ticket makes a golden day!",

Mel Stuart did add some original songs, changed the title, and swapped the nut room for the room with the golden geese, but the integrity and heart is intact. (granted that Burton did add his own subplot about wonka's childhood) Roald Dahl's books are not simply dark fantasies or absurdist romps, but are moreover sensitive and warm in a rather odd way. Dahl's conception of Willy Wonka is more reflected by Gene Wilder, who grounds himself in both worlds of fantasy and reality and moreover is warm, caring and somewhat aloof. This is something that Depp couldn't channel in his interpretation, and actually helps to cause Burton's film a breakdown. There is a quality to the original that cannot be reproduced. It is a far simpler film that doesn't try to be high and mighty. The acting is superb, the effects are simple nearly seamless, and the screenplay is dead on. This film has attained the status of a classic without trying very hard, and will not be forgotten. It needs no on screen antecedents, and I feel that the remake was made more or less to cash in on Burton's swiftly declining originality, and the fruits of the box office. Simply put, the original is far more genuine.",

The set designs of the chocolate factory, in particular, are stunning, just like the sets of Munchkinland in \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Gene Wilder (famous in a lot of Mel Brooks movies) is perfect as Willy Wonka. In fact, to me, he IS Willy Wonka. I've heard some rumor that he's least proud of this movie than some of his others, and that's something of a shame, because this is the role I will always remember him for. He has a lot of funny lines of dialogue where he sings to Veruca Salt's father. My favorite characters are Willy Wonka and Charlie Bucket, one of the five golden ticket winners. My favorite scene is when Wonka, Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Mike Teevee and his mother are in the television room, WonkaVision. This long sequence is all in white, and makes for a wonderful psychedelic experience.

Kids love eating candy and here was an opportunity for them to spend all their hard-earned money to buy chocolate bars with the expectation of finding a gold coupon (one of about 10) that would allow them into Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. I loved it for I was a candy freak as a child and am a pastry and sugar freak now. But I hated it for two reasons. It is like a lottery where all the children spend all their money on candybars with the expectation of finding the very few gold coupons enclosed. Alas there can be only one winner and everyone else is disappointed. Willy made a lot of money on that deal. Charlie has his high hopes of getting that very last coupon that is available as there are public announcements as coupons are found. What I didn't like about the movie is this: It is a children's movie and I don't like smoking in any movie let alone children's movies. Charlie's bed-ridden Grandpa is always smoking. In fact Charlie buys the old man tobacco with his own money that he earned on his paper route. I can see tobacco company executives wringing their hands with glee over this. On top of that the lead character, Willy Wonka, played by Gene Wilder, is seen smoking in his office near the end of the movie. Nice role-model he is. This movie is a kid's delight. Kids love eating candy and here was an opportunity for them to spend all their hard-earned money to buy chocolate bars with the expectation of finding a gold coupon (one of about 10) that would allow them into Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. I loved it for I was a candy freak as a child and am a pastry and sugar freak now. But I hated it for two reasons. It is like a lottery where all the children spend all their money on candybars with the expectation of finding the very few gold coupons enclosed. Alas there can be only one winner and everyone else is disappointed. Willy made a lot of money on that deal. Charlie has his high hopes of getting that very last coupon that is available as there are public announcements as coupons are found.

To this day, the boat ride scene showcasing Gene Wilder's penchant for maniacal song and psychadelic freak-outs gives me the willies, so to speak.  I've never had a bad acid trip, or any acid trip for that matter, but I'm sure that that scene is the synthesis of such misfortune and has, as a side effect, kept me away from the use of hallucinogens.As far as the actual story goes, I think it has nothing to do with a handful of children learning life lessons at a very dear price.  Perhaps on the surface it teaches children to not gorge themselves on bratwurst and the flows of chocolate rivers, or to not chew gum and watch excessive amounts of tv.  Couched within these preachy morale narratives is a deeper message; one which puts on display the excesses of the modern world, more specifically the first world and it's exploitation of the third.  I'd like to expound on this further, but honestly, nobody cares and I'm at work, so I've already over extended myself as it is. I'm just doing this to hear myself type anyway, maybe I'll add more later.",

The performances are wonderful, the music is timeless, and it is quite a good rendition of the classic book by Roald Dahl, granted Mr. Dahl wrote the screenplay. Now a re-make of the classic film is slated to be shot. I find this hard to believe-- just like re-making Psycho-- what is the point? Re-making films in the era of video and DVD seems silly. In the earlier days of films, the older versions were not readily available for the public, so it seemed fine to re- introduce the world to the stories, but now I just don't understand the point in re- making films that are classics. The new one may be a fine rendition-- I have faith that Johnny Depp is fully capable of playing a wonderful Willy Wonka, but it's a role that I think was already extremely well portrayed by Gene Wilder. What a magical movie this is, what a wonderful story-- every child should see Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, the original, the classic...",

Certainly Johnny Depp is an \"odd enough\" and versatile actor to play the recluse of Wonka, but would have much preferred they left Charlie & The Chocolate Factory for Wilder and let Depp play Wonka on The Great Glass Elevator. Still, will go see the new movie and see how Burton has \"darkened\" the Wonka character. I'm hoping it will still be a lite enough movie for younger kids, but am guessing this will not be the case.

Had I been ten years younger I would've been really frightened by this movie, especially by the tunnel scene. And yes, it is somewhat dark. After seeing it a couple more times however, I came to like it more and more, and now it's one of my favorite movies. Why? Because it 'hits the spot' in every way a children's movie should.It's about a poor little boy who gets to live out the dream of every kid in the world. There's a choco-river, humor, music, fun props, candy, enough to make even an adult's imagination run wild. WWACF is an enjoyable escape from reality, and is actually very well made. Adults can also pick out the brilliant humor imbedded in the dialog.Apart from a few unnecessary songs and questionable scenes, Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory is a great classic.

As suitable for adults as children. I think the name change (to 'Willy Wonka and ...' from 'Charlie and ...') was because the story of the film had some radical differences from the book, particularly in Charlie's discovery of the golden ticket and the film's ending, and not least because the film was set in the U.S.A., while the book was in England. In my opinion the changes were an improvement, creating a snappier and more credible storyline.The music is infectious; from the days before computer assisted music, the film had to use an orchestra - all the better for it.

I also wonder what did Charlie's Grandparents do about using the restroom if they occording to Charlies Mom had not been out of the bed in twenty years. Wonka says to Charlie at the end of the movie that only an adult could take over the factory because an adult would want to do things his own way.

I thought I was the only one who noticed that and I still can't believe it every time I see it. What in hell possessed them to include that in the film? I heard there were some interesting scenes shot for this movie that were scrapped because I guess when they showed them to a test audience, the audience didn't laugh when they were supposed to laugh so they left out the scenes...I think one was something about a traveller going to see an old wise man guru and the punch line was, \"Life is a disappointment\"...anyway, even if these scenes did not work, I sure wish they would release them in a special edition of this movie with unseen footage-it would be facinating to see. Characters were great-I loved the school teacher, Veruca Salt, Violet, and Charlie's mother especially, and Gene Wilder was perfect for the role! I just think they shouldn't have included the chicken part.",

            "content": "The movie's plot is about the titular Willy Wonka who owns a mysterious chocolate factory that nobody can have access to. Soon, Wonka announces that there is a contest that involves people buying his chocolate bars and finding golden tickets hidden inside. The winner receives a tour of his strange factory, but since there are only 5 tickets in the entire world, it's way easier said than done. A modest boy named Charlie is the story's unlikely protagonist, he is humble enough to not let the temptation of finding a golden ticket control his life. He doesn't expect to find one, and his family is much more important to him than a bunch of candy. As time goes by, the golden tickets start getting discovered by lucky children from various locations around the world, but the kids who win are all spoiled and don't really deserve them. A gluttonous German kid named Augustus is the first winner, followed by Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, and Mike Teevee. Finally, Charlie manages by pure luck to find a ticket after the original fifth winner is proved to be a fake. Out of all the children who win, Charlie is the only decent one that doesn't have a snarky, in-your-face attitude, and it makes the audience sympathize with him. The rest of the movie involves Charlie being taken on a tour (along with the other children) of Wonka's factory while he is chaperoned by his formerly bedridden grandfather. Wonka shows them all kinds of strange candy related things, from waterfalls made of melted chocolate to drinks that allow the consumer to float. There's a shocking false ending where Charlie, as the only remaining member of the tour after all the other kids have been eliminated, asks Wonka about the promised lifetime supply of chocolate, and Wonka tells him he's not getting any as he \"broke the rules\" by stealing the lifting drinks. Charlie's grandfather suggests to Charlie he should get even with Wonka by giving the recipes for some of his secret Candy to his adversary Slugworth, but Charlie returns the gobstopper to Wonka instead. As it turns out, this whole part was just a test of morals that only Charlie was decent enough to pass, and Wonka tells Charlie that his family now has legal ownership over his factory. The performances in this movie are all amazing, especially Wilder's, and he was without a doubt the best Willy Wonka ever.",

            "content": "\"Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination\" as we are guided through the Wonka Factory by the unpredictable Willy Wonka showing that anything is possible with some imagination. A fantastic family musically film filled with inspiration and imagination that everyone would enjoy even with the dark tone. A wonderful adaptation from Roald Dahl (personally he despise the movie)a great cast, wonderful soundtrack good storyline makes a movie worth watching.Willy Wonka thought off a great marketing ploy by opening his factory to the winners of the 5 golden tickets and a lifetime supply of Wonka bars. Wonkamania begins everybody wanted one,as the golden tickets are found we see that the kids except Charlie won are brats. The second half is about Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory hence the title name.The fine-line of genius and insanity is blurred with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka and his only role Peter Ostrum as Charlie the innocent kid. The movie is directed by Mel Staurt and was release back in 1971 so it is a classic and filmed in Technicolor.The entire movie most of the color were muted except the color red a few other color but mostly bright red (Charlie sweater).Not only the characters and the wonderful props but the\u00a0original musical score brings another aspect to this magical movie. Composed by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley it was nominated for Best Original Score back in 1972.It is indeed a musical with catchy musical numbers and inspiring songs with a message behind it. Starting with the opening credit to the ending credit an instrumental of Pure Imagination sets the tone.\u00a0 There are some dark tone like the how world obsession with chocolate early on (Wonkamania)and the tunnel scene which Gene Wilder did a great performance that people on the set though he went crazy by being in the tunnel. It seems that Willy Wonka planned on getting rid of the kids throughout the film and what really happen to the kids when they disappeared? Overall a musical about imagination and inspiration with a little bit of insanity making it worth watching many times.Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory shows a possibility of joy for a poor boy. So what happen to the boy who suddenly got everything he alway wanted? He lived happily ever after. Take the main lyrics and apply it to life.\"We are the music maker and we are the dreamers of dream\".",

            "content": "This is an awesome movie. I recall seeing it in the theater as a kid and have loved it ever since. There is something disturbing that I have noticed lately and is what I call the Grandpa Joe Quandary. I dearly loved Grandpa Joe as a kid but now he seems less likeable and selfish. Lets look at the facts. He lay in bed for 20 years while Charlie's mom worked like a slave to keep them all in poverty. His only luxury was a bowl a week. I wish I had that much!! At one point he gives Charlie a Wonka bar and everyone is mystified as to where he got it. He said he quit smoking but if the young slave in training Charlie nor his Mother purchased it, who then?. Perhaps there is more to Grandpa Joe's sinister side. When Charlie finally does get the golden ticket, Grandpa Joe is not only the first to stake his claim to it but can mystically rise from the bed in which he has been imprisoned for the last 20 years. Within minutes he can sing, dance and run around. Perhaps greed is the driving factor. i.e. \"I've got a golden ticket\" not we have a golden ticket. Listen to this key evidence and you will realize that Grandpa Joe is seemingly only in it for himself. Not once does he offer to care for the elders while Charlie and his Mom go to the factory. Grandpa does have a need to indulge his perverse side when convincing Charlie to steal Fizzie Lifting Drinks as well, knowing the potential outcome of this crime. Perhaps this was his way of training Charlie for his future, whatever that may have been if it were not for Willy Wonka. Grandpa Joe is quick to foul mouth Mr. Wonka when confronted with his improprieties and eager to join Slugworths minions at the first sign of trouble.",

I would give the new one 2 out of 10 as it is a disgrace to the old version. Just because Roald Dahl didn't like this film it does not mean he would like that one. Gene Wilders performance is spectacular. This is the classic and it can't be beaten by any crappy performance by any actor no matter how famous.

            "content": "All the greatest children's stories are slightly dark and feature a maniacal hero that only kids can accept without applying cynicism. This Roald Dahl story is far less cruel and sadistic than the book, unfortunately, yet still transports you into a magical world of fantasy. Both a modern fairytale and trippy fable, this is a film that I watched on rotation as a child. It both speaks to, and awakens your imagination, and now as a young adult, it is still one of my favourite films, and it's moralistic approach always has me returning the metaphorical everlasting gob-stopper.Made in 1971, this film is definitely a product of its time. Colourful and highly kitsch, I can just imagine a flat of students,  sitting down to watch this as a fail-safe cosmic experience. The scene with the hallucinogenic tunnel is scary when you are little, the Ooompa Loompa's, amusing, yet when you get older, they both become equally terrifying and yet incredibly captivating and call out to a part of you that you thought had fallen asleep when you hit puberty.Gene Wilder excels as he plays a pure caricature of an eccentric magician with a sky-high intellect and equally vast plans for his golden ticket winners. This is not an easy task, but is executed with complete style - a totally classic performance. Veruca Salt's dreams of a bean feast are also a delight everytime. Julie Dawn Cole expertly plays the role of psychotic \u0091exorcist-style' brat from hell with a twinkle in her eye and a sardonic smile. This child of Satan also went on to provide a name for a rather average but fun band, as well as perhaps demonstrating the first signs of dangerous girl power to a generation of Spice Girl parents.\nEach stage of the film is memorable, playing with your mind and teasing the senses. That is the beauty of this film. Suspend all rationality and ignore the messy confines of logic. Instead, look into yourself and be reminded that the most important thing to be, is a good person. Or something like that. That, and it is always good to eat a lot of artificially coloured confectionery.",

We all have some aspect of each of these characters inside us.  Both the greedy kids and their equally greedy parents are unfortunately just like us.  However, there is hope for our world because inside each of us is a bit of the virtuous Charlie, struggling to succeed.But Willy Wonka is the truly magical character of this movie.  He has the creative mind and flamboyant nature that we all have, but rarely show.  He lives in a paradise of his own creation.  He lets his imagination and desires dictate what he does, without succumbing to the sin of greed.But this is all subtly delivered to you.  You don't have to analyze this movie to enjoy it.  You have so many fantastic characters that parallel the school teachers, news reporters, psychologists, and scientists of the world to laugh at again and again.It's a movie of two halves: The first is the outside world where five golden tickets are found.  The second is the fantasy world of the Chocolate Factory where imagination comes to life.  What this movie does so well is combine the two worlds, suggesting we add more fantasy and creativity to our repetitve and greedy everyday lives.

            "content": "Roald Dahl is an author many adults find unsettling. They hate the idea of their children reading books in which the grown-ups are so consistently portrayed as stupid, cruel, and out of touch with the really important things in life. His earlier work is a lot less harsh, but the attitude is basically the same: most people are cruel idiots, and the exceptional few who are not are justified in doing what they like to the many who are. Not a nice point of view, but it makes for interesting stories which -- crucially -- place the eccentric characters above the \"normal\" ones._Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_ was a favourite of mine as a child, chiefly for the factory itself, a creation which ranks with Wonderland as a magical realm in which reality is ever-so-slightly skewed. The film is different in many ways to the book -- what film adaptation is not? -- but it has a power all its own, derived from the hallucinogenic imagery and the witty songs as much as from Gene Wilder's absent-minded-professor performance as Wonka. The characters are slightly different, as is the plot, and Dahl reportedly hated the film, but so what? A book is not a film, and vice versa. The film's story and overall tone is faithful to the tone of Dahl's book (and, in some ways, the sequel _Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator_) and it has essentially the same moral: you can't get something for nothing, even by magic, and if you want to get you want it is sometimes necessary to think in spirals.On top of that, the film is never dull, always entertaining. I have watched it as a child and as an adult and enjoyed it more with each viewing.",

If you haven't read the book I can strongly recommend that you see this movie. A movie about dreams coming true, worlds that just exist in your imagination (and on film) and great humour.

Spellbinding, psychedelic, Strange(in a good way), uplifting, imaginative, witty, and guaranteed to induce munchies. Gene Wilder is outstanding as the eccentric confectioner, managing to be dry(His half hearted attempts of stopping the brats getting into trouble for instance) and compellingly odd. Peter Ostrum is also perfect as humble, shabbily handsome Charlie Bucket(Trivia: Peter Ostrum gave up acting shortly after making this film and became a Vet). The Chocolate Factory itself is a low tech miracle and although the sets were obviously made on a shoestring budget it just looks right(Even the spray-gold(tm) shopping cart doesn't look outta place with a bright orange, bright green haired person of limited stature pushing it). The films musical score is on the whole energetic uplifting and catchy, with the meloncoly \"Cheer up Charlie\" being the exception. The film has some sinister elements to it, the main one for me was the brilliantly cast Mr Slugworth(G\u00fcnter Meisner) but friends and family had their own opinions on which bits they found weird.WW&TCF has aged well and I personally feel a remake is an unnecessary step but hey what do I know it might be good but it would have to go some to be beat the original for me, but the youngungs will probably lap it up.

For a movie made in 1971, the set and effects are terrible - the Wizard of Oz is more believable and that was made in 1939! The chocolate river looked like brown colored water - they could have done better than that, thickened it up so it looked real melted chocolate. I mean, how hard could that have been? And Gene Wilder is absolutely creepy, and the singing is horrible! The boat scene, forget it - I had to turn it off this morning, it is so stupid, along with the dumb song he sings throughout it.

            "content": "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has long been one of my all time favorites when it comes to children movies. The more I think about it, though, the more clear it becomes to think that this movie isn't only for the youngsters, but adults and teenagers alike. The humor that melts off of every single action and event, the zaniness of the story, the setting for which the film takes place in... all of it adds up to a movie that the whole family can enjoy. The book that this movie was based off of, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is also a favorite of mine, if not because Roald Dahl wrote it. That brings me to one of my biggest reasons why this movie was such a hit success: the man truly behind the story was not necessarily the director, but Dahl, who made up from scratch every nook and cranny you see. He also wrote the screenplay, as a matter of fact. From the almost loony Willy Wonka - - played perfectly by none other than the legendary Gene Wilder - - to the chocolate factory itself, it's hard not to take notice and admit that Mr. Dahl played an important role in the movies glory.So let's get down to the meat of the movie, shall we? The lead character of our story is a young boy by the name of Charlie Bucket (played by the talented Peter Ostrum) who lives in a lower-class neighborhood alongside his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) and several other ailing family members. Sweeping into town comes an announcement from behind the doors of a mysterious chocolate factory: five lucky children will have a chance to get a tour of the also mystical Willy Wonka's factory! The chase is on, and all chocolate factories from one end of the street to another are jam-packed of kids wanting to find the lucky golden ticket that holds the \"key\" to the tour. Before anyone knows what's happened, four kids have got their tickets. Sadly, all of them are spoiled rotten brats. This pattern changes when Charlie finds the final ticket, and he's ecstatic. Bringing along Grandpa Joe, Charlie embarks on the tour with high hopes. What he gets is more than a little unexpected, I'm sure.I can't help but take notice of the amazingly beautiful background that this film is saturated in. Yes, perhaps they are dated, but for a movie that was filmed in the early 1970's, the producers and what not did a superb job of making the whole \"fantasy candy land\" a reality, and I applaud them sincerely. I actually think it's better that this movie is so old, as it gives it a very surreal aura. I also cannot forget the acting! Throughout the movie I found myself honestly intrigued with every character that was thrown my way. Every actor made their persona as believable as possible, especially Gene Wilder who I have to tip my hat to. I first saw the man in Young Frankenstein, and he never ceases to surprise me with his unbelievable top-botch portrayal of zany characters. His job as Willy Wonka is no exception.Willy Wonka is a part of pop culture, it would seem. It's hard not to notice the effect that it's had on the States. Whether it's constant references to people turning into blueberries, the constant jokes about Oompa Loompa's, the memorable Marilyn Manson video where he imitates one of my favorite scenes in the movie... it all gives more reason to check this movie out. As I said before, this is a total family movie. Not just confined to the age-old \"child\" or \"adult\" categories, Willy Wonka crosses the border and becomes a classic that no one will forget any time soon. Check this one out now for good laughs, an intriguingly eccentric story and character line-up, and extraordinary acting to boot.",

Doubtless there are some who would not enjoy this movie, as with any movie, but it is certainly among the best kids movies ever made, that is also enjoyable for adults. The film deals with a boys journey through the chocolate factory of the eccentric Mr Willy Wonka. It is an adaptation of a novel by acclaimed children's author Roald Dahl, and as such, the plot is whimsical and engrossing. I have no complaints with the plot, except for Charlie visiting his mother at the laundry, an intrusive device to allow the inclusion of a song that is boring at best. The song was supposed to give some emotional impact, and give us a look into the relationship between Charlie and his mother. The only thing this achieves, is to leave the viewer wondering why Charlie did not even consider asking his mother to accompany him to the chocolate factory, instead of his bedridden (and lazy) grandfather. Aside from this small complaint, I believe the plot is excellent.The casting of the film is superb, leading to some great acting. The obvious standout is Mr Gene Wilder, who gives the performance of his lifetime as Willy Wonka. He is charming, eccentric, dark and a little bit scary. Of course no small amount of this is due to a script that gives him some great lines. Still, we must take nothing away from Gene Wilder, who gives a performance that most actors would give their right arms to equal. Other characters are also memorable, such as; Charlie's teacher, Veruca, Veruca's father, Violet, Mr Slugworth and the candy store owner. All of the actors playing these parts give exceptional performances. In regards to the characters, the only real complaint is Charlie himself. He is noticeably the weakest link in the chain. This is not entirely the actors fault, though he must shoulder some of the blame. The character, as written, is weak. He is given nothing memorable to say or do. He seems to be your classic goody-two-shoes (despite the \"fizzy lifting drink\" episode, obviously added to try and combat this problem). Charlie is supposed to be the \"straight\" character, in that he is the normal one. This is to give the other characters someone to \"bounce off\" if you will. However this idea was carried much to far, to the detriment of the film. Such is the problem that every second Charlie is on screen, we wish for the camera to focus on a different character. Other than this, the characters, and acting, are great.It may seem that this review is rather critical given the rating (10/10). This rating was given in response to the amount of enjoyment that one can get from watching this film. The movie is flawed, yet it is a great movie nonetheless. No movie is perfect, despite what some fans might say. But a great movie is enjoyable in spite of its flaws. This is a must see movie. Please, before seeing the new Tim Burton version, watch Mel Stuart's version, as it is one of the great films.",

So many others are filled with perversion or violence it's difficult for one to simply sit back and enjoy the movie. The film features a small boy who lives in impoverished conditions and because of his deepest desires wins and opportunity to visit the famed `Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory'.  The movie points out very valuable lessons for children and adults alike.  Avoid the snares of greed and dishonesty. Avoid the mind rotting affects of watching too much television.

            "content": "Author of stories like 'The BFG', 'The Witches' and 'Matilda', Dahl's stories have given joy to children for a long time now. With so many of his stories being made into films, it's not difficult to see that Hollywood loves him too. In 1971, one of his finest stories was made into a musical starring Gene Wilder. Magnificantly 'odd', Wilder's Willy Wonka is a genuinely surreal performance. Twenty years on, and an inferior sequel later, and Wilder is still the way to go. The film might be dated, but with a Wonka like this, it's impossible not to fall in love with the film again.Charlie Bucket's (Peter Ostrum) family are incredibly poor. Living with his mum and four grandparents, Charlie dreams of better things. When the mysterious Willy Wonka (Wilder) announces that five lucky children will be allowed to tour his chocolate factory, Charlie has a dream. Receiving one chocolate bar on his birthday however, the odds are stacked against him. Still, this is a fairy tale, so you can imagine what's coming next.Filmed in Eastern Europe and with five children paid on the cheap, 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' is full of legends on screen and off. Colourful and beautiful throughout, it possesses many amazing scenes.As far as children performers go, the three kids do an alright job. Ostrum and Julie Dawn Cole (playing the greedy Veruca Salt) in particular are singled out for praise as they jump, run, sing and perform for the camera at every possibility. Ultimately though, the children will always be overshadowed by Gene Wilder.Wilder takes insanity to a new level. One moment seeming totally normal, and the next randomly talking and singing to himself, Wilder's Wonka is a man on the edge. You watch him and you just know that he could win your heart whilst simultaneously scare you senseless. You certainly have to wonder what Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) is thinking when Wonka hugs Charlie towards the end. Ultimately though, however nuts Wilder is in this film, it is him who makes it watchable so many years later.",

The songs are all brilliant(except maybe \"Cheer up Charlie\" which is OK in moderation but gets a little tiring after a while)I mean, come on, \"Pure Imagination\", \"I've got a golden ticket\" Verruca Salt singing \"I want it now\", and obviously, \"The Candyman\". And no matter what anyone says, I love the boat scene. i know the special effects are crap(none of them get splashed, their hair isn't even blown back!) but Gene Wilder's weird spur-of-the-moment song sends shivers down my spine.

This film comes about 90% of the way to the sparkle of the book.Roald Dahl's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" was one of those rare pieces of children's literature that didn't pander to its audience - no soft, safe goody-two-shoes story, but rather a rich, wry, giddy whirl, full of barbs and gleeful prankery.  The film (retitled for the main character) gets about as close to Dahl's manic irony as a children's movie has ever come or is ever likely to.  I can almost picture a young Tim Burton watching it over and over.  (For some examples of less-successful stabs at bringing Dahl's children's work to the screen, see \"Matilda\" and \"James and the Giant Peach.\")It's too bad they don't make them like this any more.  I enjoyed it as a child because it had wit and cunning, and managed to be moral without preaching (which seems to be beyond the capabilities of today's children's filmmakers).  I enjoy it even more as an adult just to revel in its delightful edginess and smile at the puns and wordplay.I have this to say to those worrywarts who wring their hands and natter about this film supposedly causing psychological damage to kids: get a life. Children are not fragile little soap bubbles that will burst at the touch of a sharp wit, unless you make them that way.  They're people too, and they can appreciate cleverness when they see it.

I love the three main characters - they all play their roles to perfection, particularly Gene Wilder who was just perfect casting. His Willy Wonka is, naturally, a reclusive oddball who, in the course of the factory tour, proves to be an intriguing combination of secretive, controlling, unpredictable grown-up and candid, excitable, mischievous, capricious child.

The viewer is carried away into a world where good is rewarded and evil is punished (or sent down a garbage chute!). In the end you walk away feeling that good begets good and all is right in the world...if only through the course of the film.Even though the film was made in 1971 it is not dated and the effects hold up. Gene Wilder plays a quirky chocolatier who randomly slips into the erratic but guides five children into a world of pure imagination. His performance is infallible and unfaltering. Along the way the viewer is able to see what behavior is unacceptable, thanks to the Oompa Loompa's musical morality. The film does leave some questions unanswered. The most glaring being where are Charlie's parents? If you as the viewer can dismiss reality and all logical explanation for just a few hours...you're in for a wild ride.The sign of a \"classic\" film is one that holds up through time.

It's a family film, but one of the most important aspects of a family film is that it has to be enjoyable for a variety of ages. This is what makes movies like Toy Story and Shrek such huge successes- the adults will love it just as much as the kids are sure to. Hence: 'family' film. On the other hand, this is also the downfall of such other movies that are strictly for a much younger audience, like Cats & Dogs. The makers of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory understood this very well, and you can see that just by the way that the cast is divided. Here are all of these kids (funny how it was only kids who found those golden tickets\u0085) who were at this candy factory, and they had each elected to bring one of their parents with them as the one admissible member of their family who was allowed by Wonka to accompany them to the factory.One of the best elements of this film is the excellently written script and, even more, the songs. These are some of the best songs in any movie ever made, rivaling even the best of the songs from Disney's films (hey, some of them are really good\u0085). There are, of course, some exceptions, such as 'Cheer up, Charlie,' which I have been fast-forwarding through for as long as I can remember, but for the most part, the songs are fun to listen to and they pertain to life outside the movie. They are not just songs about the candy-making genius of Willy Wonka or the excitement of being able to tour his mysterious factory, but they are about life in the real world. They're about believing in yourself and being motivated in life ('Anything you want to, do it. Want to change the world, there's nothing to it\u0085'), but there are also some that have to do mostly with the movie but are still just as enjoyable, such as the classic song that Wonka sings in the tunnel on board his boat (curiously named 'Wonkatania'), which was creepily covered by Marilyn Manson a couple of decades later.",

            "content": "When Gene Wilder died there was quiet grief that shook fans everywhere. Willy Wonka is one of those legendary roles and Gene Wilder brought the character to life. Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was released 52 years ago and hasn't aged a day. There's something primal about the story of Charlie Bucket going on the hero's journey. It's what Dan Harmon describes as \"an endlessly entertaining myth that's really just satisfying on the level of Jack and the Beanstalk or Ulysses fighting a cyclops.\" \n\nFor many of us kids, we loved Gene Wilder and his Wonka adventures since we were first able to love things. It's a fondness that runs deep. Wonka is a unique character. It's easy to relate to an underdog like Charlie but Wonka is who we want to be. Whatever his troubled past, Wonka made it to the other side. He's a self-made and successful business owner who runs a candy factory. \n\nHow does Wonka do it? Winkelmann says, \"How do fish swim? How do birds fly? They do it because they were born to do it. Just like Willy Wonka was born to be a candy man.\" That passion is contagious and admirable. Wonka is a big kid. He wears a purple coat, brown top hat, and large bow tie. He's often cynical and fights against his anger, but he's also optimistic, sentimental, and hopeful. He feels everything. He's broken but there's a humanity beneath the surface.\n\nWilly Wonka follows the Joseph Campbell myth. It's a traditional story that is well told and faithfully executed. Based on the 1964 book by Roald Dahl, Willy Wonka is thematically rich. Dahl is a legend for any anglophile. His work has been adapted by many filmmakers including Steven Spielberg. Dahl's life was plagued with joy and tragedy. Many of Dahl's characters are orphans and Charlie Bucket has no father or siblings. The character of Willy Wonka is based on Edward Cadbury of the Cadbury chocolate company. Cadbury produced everything from chocolate bars to the Turkish delight featured in The Chronicles of Narnia.\n\nWhen Dahl was a child in the 1920s, chocolate ceased to be a luxury product and became affordable to the working class. During the war, the British government encouraged chocolate production like the US government encouraged cheese. There was a lot available and everyone ate it. For Dahl, chocolate was escapism. Dahl's stories always had a combination of sorrow and joy, tragedy and triumph. But there was always a prevailing optimism and childlike wonder.\n\nWilly Wonka is about five kids who get a Golden Ticket and the chance to tour the chocolate factory. The tour is really a test as Wonka is looking for an apprentice to take over. All the kids have a fatal flaw or a bad habit. Augustus Gloop is a glutton, Veruca Salt is spoiled, Mike Teevee watches too much TV, and Violet Beauregarde chews gum. In addition, each kid is tempted by Slugworth to steal an Everlasting Gobstopper in exchange for money. But Charlie is pure of heart.\n\nWonka instructs, \"Now remember, no messing about. No touching, no tasting, no telling.\" If anyone disobeys the rules, he or she is disqualified from winning a lifetime supply of candy. These rules are impossible to keep and every kid falls short. No one deserves to win. But unlike the other kids who get eliminated by their own choices, it's Grandpa Joe who offers Charlie the Fizzy Lifting drink which causes him to break the rules. \n\nWonka sees this and lets it slide for the moment. Even the Tunnel of Terror is a test where the passengers are shown distributing images. Wonka wants to see who will crack first. Charlie and Grandpa Joe remain calm until Wonka starts his sadistic poem. Wonka makes every question a quiz, every choice a test. Charlie is judged in relation to the other kids and in the end, he is morally exceptional. \n\nUpset with Wonka's legalism, Grandpa Joe wants to give the gobstopper to Slugworth but Charlie refuses. There's a line Charlie won't cross. Charlie cares for Wonka like a child does a father. It seems to be destiny that the fatherless Charlie and the childless Wonka are brought together. Charlie has a Wonka size hole in his heart that can't be filled with money and moon pies. Wonka sees that Charlie was raised right and says that his entire family can move in with him. \n\nThe Oompa Loompas agree with the bad parent philosophy, \"Blaming the kids is a lie and a shame / You know exactly who's to blame? / The mother and the father.\" Charlie's surrogate family is made whole. Wonka is like Carnegie, Ford, and Gates. His factory is made possible through Capitalism. To paraphrase Wonka, \"If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it. Anything you want to do - do it.\" Wonka knows what he wants, goes after at, and lives are changed because of it. \n\nCharlie and his destitute family are pulled out of poverty by Wonka. And Charlie wasn't rewarded for free. He had to earn his place at the table or he wouldn't appreciate it. Early in the story, Charlie has a paper route. He's the only kid in the group that is seen working. He's also the most generous of the five kids. Charlie is anxious to share with others and kind to everyone.\n\nWilly Wonka rests of the very capable shoulders of Gene Wilder. He's a staple of childhood and an iconic performer. No one else could embody the zany, joyous, lunatic, but calculated energy like Wilder. The film just doesn't work without Gene. Director Mel Stuart is the cousin of Stan Lee so it's clear that Pure Imagination runs in the family. The collaboration of Wilder, Stuart, and Dahl is one for the books. \n\nThe music by Bricusse, Newley, and Scharf is some of best in film history. They are the music makers. They are the dreamers of dreams. Wonka the man has childhood hurts that need healing and his arrested development is relatable to a young audience. Nerdist writer Michael Walsh said it well, \"Willy Wonka didn't fail the world, it failed him. The world can seem dark and disappointing, but it isn't. There is always hope, a humanity that will overcome, and it was Gene Wilder who brought that to life.\"",

The film does have a number of merits, especially the flawless performance of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, a characterisation that is charming and funny at the same time. Another standout is Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, his scenes with Charlie were lovingly realised, but in his song, he was just hilarious, and his singing voice was remarkably good. However, whereas Peter Ostrum is perfectly agreeable in terms of acting as Charlie, he is let down by his lack of any real singing ability. Though the film does look beautiful with excellent cinematography and colourful sets, and the supporting characters like the Oompa Loompas, the odiously spoilt Veruca Salt, television addict Mike Tevee and the rather disgusting Violet Bueragarde, are very well done, and the actors are further advantaged by a wonderful sparkling script. The songs are lovely, especially Oompa Loompa, Imagination and I want it Now, though I will say I felt Cheer Up Charlie was rather tedious and slowed the film down quite considerably. Overall, a beautiful film, and I do think it is underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

I liked Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, his character looks like a psychopath version of The Cat in the Hat. Surprisingly, the only of the five children who I could feel empathy for was Mike Teevee. I loved his innocence. Charlie's background isn't enough to make me feel for him (I don't know why, we just didn't hit it off); Veruca Salt is someone who I would use Mike's toy pistol, but with real bullets; Augustus Gloop appears in a very short time, and Violet Beauregarde is just obnoxious. The factory itself was also not that attractive. I felt like I was going to Disney world as a grown-up man who never grew up or developed a passion for Disney, I was a mere spectator (I was not immersed). About the epilogue, at the same time I liked the plot twist, the form that the message is passed seems forced. Also, the visual effects didn't age well. Anyway, I think my next review will be a good complement to this one. Now, let's travel 34 years forward.",

I had so many laughs throughout.  So many things in the movie don't make sense, but with a movie like this, I reckon it's not supposed to lol.  I am not sure how I feel about casting little people as Oompa Loompa's, I admit, but the use of just one 1 character for the Oompa Loompa's in the remake did not impress me.

If you watch the documentary on this movie the creator and director says that they didn't actually make this movie for kids. They made this movie for adults knowing that the kids would still be enchanted by the beautiful sets and colors and candy. However they wanted to do a sort of kids movie for adults and when you watch it you will get it.",

With this movie being made in the early 70's, it still holds up for the most part, almost grasping that classic title. Stuart & Dahl put a lot of heart into this film, giving the audience a pure, heartfelt message. The narrative is very creative & unique, while having some strange & over the top moments that were hit or miss. The first act made for a solid one, introducing these odd but fun characters, but it could've been cut down maybe by ten minutes, allowing the second act to have just that much more time to shine.\n\nThe cast of the fim put on great performances across the board, but Gene Wilder absolutely stole the show! This was such a trademark casting, where even the best actors today couldn't recapture his character. Peter Ostrum as Charlie did a very good job! He put on a great performance, where you really cared for him and his struggles from the first minute. Jack Albertson was another enjoyable addition to the film, adding great mature nature to the film, with an enjoyable hint of playfulness. The golden ticket finders and their parents all stood out in their own way, and were all around a load of fun. They're not characters you can really invest into, but they're great additions nevertheless.\n\nThe screenplay was real charming, with a sweet & sour twist to it. The production design was real colorful a beautifully crafted, along with a FANTASTIC & catchy soundtrack to fit this fun movie.\n\nOverall, this movie had some room for improvement, maybe not holding up the best after almost a whopping 50 years, but this is definitely something you need to see before you die !",

Stuart's craftsmanship is undeniable with clever shots of candy, faces, and eyes that convey a sense of wonder and expression. \n\nWilly Wonka is a hilarious satire on the depravity society undergoes for social acceptance and financial freedom. This film takes on class struggle, British education, media coverage, shoddy journalism, excessive capitalism, corrupt business practices, and above all, bad parenting. You will laugh at something new every year you go back and watch Willy Wonka.\n\nThere is even a few horror elements as these children and their chosen immediate family members undergo a haunted house disguised as a candy themed fun house. The children are competing for a lifetime supply of chocolate, so they are whittled down to one as they disappear. The boat sequence with spliced in edits of gruesome or creepy imagery is meant to unnerve you and scarred an entire generation of kids that watched Willy Wonka. Facing disappointment and defeat is another interesting lesson Willy Wonka teaches young Charlie, but thankfully he is such a sympathetic and selfless character he wins by virtue of his decency. Charlie has only ever cared for others and desired something of his own, thus Wonka finds him worthy to inherit his magnificent chocolate factory.\n\nThe family drama is heartwarming as we follow the likable lead from a desolate environment of abject poverty into a sustainable future of happiness and success. Charlie Bucket is wonderfully played by Peter Ostrum, who is the most pathetic and destitute Charlie Bucket imaginable. His misfortune is all brought on him by his low birth, but the reason you empathize and sympathize with him is that he'e righteous good, selfless care, and random luck personified. Ostrum captures a childlike wonder of the impossible and magic that enthralls you to the end of his sweet story.\n\nLikewise, Gene Wilder steals the show as the eccentric and entertaining candy inventor Willy Wonka! Wilder carries himself with a confident, likable grandeur and a charming facade for Willy Wonka to hypnotize you with constant wonders, misdirection, and advice. Wilder's singing during Willy Wonka's signature song \"Pure Imagination\" is iconic and lovely. His character clearly loathes the bad kids and desperately wants to find a pearl among the swines. Wilder's sly smile and quirky persona make for an unforgettable Willy Wonka like no other could ever replicate. Wilder's dramatic performance in Wonka's half office is gripping, scary, heartwarming, and life changing as he goes through so many emotions in the span of a few seconds. Gene Wilder was a gifted actor able to captivate you with his cunning dramatic skill and delight you with rousing charismatic comedy. \n\nWilder is funny giving cruel commentary as children are taken away by his wondrous little workers the Oompa Loompas. These little people are delightful with their luminescent green hair, dyed orange skin, white overalls, and goofy dances. I adore their parable songs that teach each lesson to the audience after each bad egg among the cast's batch gets theirs. They teach excellent lessons warning against indulging greed, consuming gluttony, being rude, watching too much television, and spoiling your children. Jack Albertson is fantastic as the morally curious Grandpa Joe character, who wants the best for his grandson Charlie. I really like Charlie's sad mother Diana Sowle, who is just trying to give Charlie a decent life through her clothes washing job.\n\nFurthermore, I like how Wonka's mystique is established early, so that you are curious about this hidden candy man shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Especially as you realize quickly, Wonka just wants to punish the wicked children for their bad morals, while rewarding the innocent and kindly chosen child. A sweet kid could surely be the only winner of a candy factory for Willy Wonka.\n\nAs for the bad children, the child cast is filled with apt casting of the most reprehensible and annoying deviants adolescence has ever conceived of on film. Julie Dawn Cole is the monstrous spoiled rich girl Veruca Salt. Her screaming, whining, and complaining is hilarious and fits her character perfectly. She is a great singer during her number in the golden goose room. Denise Nickerson is excellent as the constantly chewing Violet Beauregarde. She is annoying in her overly confident persona, which is perfect for this insistent child horror. Paris Themmen is crazy obnoxious as the know-it-all Mike Teavee, who worships the entertainment box too much. Michael Bollner plays the rotund glutton Augustus Gloop with a dour hunger for all sweets.\n\nFor me, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory will always remain a timeless classic for the cinema world that enchants with a vision of the world that can progress and change for the better. Remember to be yourself, be kind, and use your imagination!",

Featuring a room with a river full of thick, warm, melted chocolate and about every single candy you could imagine. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is about the genius, Willy Wonka reopening his mysterious chocolate factory. Wonka puts out 5 golden tickets in his chocolate bars in search for 5 lucky people, each person can bring along one guest. The 5 chosen ones get a lifetime supply of chocolate and a tour of Wonka's factory. Charlie Bucket, an adolescent who comes from a poor family dreams of getting one of the 5 golden tickets. Luck strikes him and he gets the last and final golden ticket. He picks Grandpa Joe as his guest. Once the tour begins, every child except for Charlie gets into unfortunate accidents and is forced to leave the tour. Charlie and Grandpa Joe sneaks out of the tour and drinks forbidden products without permission. Once the tour was over, Wonka ignores Charlie and soon tells him why: he drank forbidden product. Grandpa Joe insists on telling Arthur Slugworth the formula to the everlasting gobstopper, but Charlie returns it instead. Willy Wonka sees the kindness in Charlie's heart and Charlie's family lived happily ever after.\n\tI rate this movie 9/10 stars. I still vividly remember my reaction to the first time I saw this classic movie. It made me dream for days about Wonka's amazing room of imagination. The characters are all unique in their own ways and the creativity and plot of this movie are fantastic! I've never seen any movie like it before! They did make an updated version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but in my opinion, the original movie is better, other opinions may vary. I mean who doesn't like a movie about candy? Overall, I love this movie and I believe you will too!",

His energetic performance is by no means different from Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins. He absolutely deserved ,at least, an Oscar nomination. The movie lost some of its sharpness and suffered from some monotony after some time from reaching the factory. But besides the gorgeous production design and cool visuals, there was Wilder's charisma that helped to elevate the movie. The first half of the movie has great emotional value, and established the characters very well. Also, it feature some of the most beautiful songs of the movie. But due to the fast pacing, there was an action in the first half that felt forced, if it was necessary to serve a turning point of the story.\n\nThere are many powerful and very important messages in the movie. But the greatest thing about them is not actually the messages themselves, as we witnessed them delivered in a lot of movies before, but it's how genuine these messages seem as they are delivered in this particular story. Peter Ostrum is great in his first and ,unfortunately, his last role. There are many dramatic scenes that required a very good actor and he is. Actually, I didn't feel for even a moment that this is his acting debut. Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is a total blast from start to finish.\nIt's Scrumdiddlyumptious! \n\n(8.5/10)",

Such a simple yet deep concept is so pleasingly intriguing that one finds itself falling into the world half-way through the feature without even blinking. The passion and enthusiasm for such an eerie project is why it works for the most part of it while the rest is left upon its dark humour which may not be hilarious but certainly offers a chuckle every now and then. A gripping screenplay by Roald Dahl, himself who wrote the original book from which it is adapted, and Mel Stuart with his brilliant execution skills ups the ante and easily allows it to enter into the major league. On performance objective, Gene Wilder is stunning and satisfactory as usual and is supported by talented young actors and their humorous guardians. The first act is hilarious and exhilarating and longer than usual (which it doesn't seem so) after which it goes into dark place in its rest of the act but even that tone is so certifiably pleasing that no one minds it despite of being a feature primarily for children. Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory is a golden ticket for the ultimate cinematic experience where it doesn't bother to worry about its diplomacy and rather lets itself sink into its self-created poetic world.",

Gene Wilder is great in the role of the titular character delivering a magical performance as a guy who murders asshole children in front of their parents. I've been checking out a lot of fan theories on Reddit lately. The songs are memorable with the Oompa Loompa songs and Wilder's \"Pure Imagination\" song being the best songs in the move IMO. Seeing all these fictional sweets being translated to a movie makes them look even more inviting and I think I'd go on the drug/hell boat tunnel ride because of my weakness which is anything similar to an amusement park. Thanks to its visuals that stand the test of time, great songs and Gene Wilder's captivating performance as the possible serial killer, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory remains a classic film adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved book.",

            "content": "I read the book (by Roald Dahl) to the kids and they were very taken by its wonders and its humour (and I hoped that its morality tale would sink in).  Therefore, I was curious to see how they felt about the movie version (the one from my childhood, not the later Johnny Depp remake) which I recalled fondly, despite some vivid early nightmares featuring Oompa Loompas.  I worried a bit that the movie's images might come to dominate what they saw with their own imaginations but it seems not to be the case -- the kids voted for the book over the movie.  But perhaps that is always what happens when you read a book first?  To recap, little Charlie Bucket longs for a golden ticket that will give him a tour of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and a lifetime's supply of sweets - but there are only five such tickets in the world, hidden underneath the wrappers of Wonka chocolate bars.  Of course, after suspense is built, Charlie does find a ticket and he and his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) are taken on a magical and sometimes scary tour of the factory by Mr. Willy Wonka himself, played with a serene sense of perfect ambivalence by Gene Wilder.  Wilder is easily the best thing about the movie, giving exquisite line readings (whether absurd or menacing or bemused), although the various rooms in the factory do have a candy-coated funhouse charm to them.  Surprisingly, the film didn't seem childish or particularly dated, although the haze of nostalgia might be clouding my judgment.  I had forgotten however that this was a musical (apart from the scary songs sung by the Oompa Loompas after the bad children are dispatched with) and the various songs (including \"Candy Man\") work to bring out the fantasy elements of the film.   Of course, the book didn't have the songs and some of the episodes are different (squirrels not golden geese, for example).  Most significantly, Charlie and Grandpa Joe don't break the rules in the book.  However, this twist does add more suspense to the film than the book and gives Wilder a chance to turn Charlie's grim disappointment into ecstatic amazement, something that every child (and adult) deserves to feel at least once.",

Charlie Bucket, our protagonist, lives with his mother and 4 grandparents. They're very poor, and rely on Charlie's paper route money to get by. Which is why Charlie wants, more than anything, to win this contest. \n\nAnyone who's ever known they wanted something more than anyone else in the world can relate to Charlie's childlike desire to win Wonka's contest. It may seem frivolous, but that only highlights Charlie's desperation. He can only imagine luxurious things. And that ingenuous mindset is what just may give him what he needs.\n\nThe film enraptures you within the first 35 minutes, before we even get inside the magical factory. And once we're in, the film ascends to a whole new level. So full of unique ideas and concepts. Set pieces that made people depressed about the movie's fictionality long before Avatar's ever did.\n\nAnd Willy Wonka, himself, portrayed by Gene Wilder, is a marvel. No other man could have given us such a brilliant performance. He's sweet, he's creepy, he's sincere, and he's mischievous. Roald Dahl's original 1964 novel could be adapted for film one thousand times over, yet Wilder will always remain exclusively synonymous with the role.\n\nOh yeah, and the music is phenomenally perfect.\n\nFor being a \"flop\" from 1971, this film holds up better than most, if not all, of its contemporaries.\n\nTwizard Rating: 100",

Wilder plays the mysterious and genius candy maker Willy Wonka, who has become a recluse from society and hides inside his chocolate factory. Although he has long banned workers from going into and out of his factory, his delicious and creative chocolates as well as other exotic candies keep on coming out. As such, he and his candies have become stuff of legend. In the film, he has finally decided to reopen and allow outsiders to enter and tour his factory. The catch is that only five people and an accompanying guest will be allowed the great honor. In a brilliant method to randomly select those individuals, he has placed five Golden Tickets in five random candy bars. The lucky people that find the tickets will be granted entry into the factory and receive a lifetime supply of chocolate. The story follows the young and selfless Charlie Bucket who hopelessly dreams of defying the odds and finding one of the tickets. Of course, he does it and we follow him, four other children, and their adult chaperones as they explore the fantastic and surreal yet dangerous factory of Willy Wonka. Interestingly, the movie was a flop when it was first released in 1971. However, its popularity increased in the mid-1980s due to television broadcasts and home video sales. Retrospectively, it has become one of the most beloved children's movies and is critically acclaimed. I remember it fondly as part of my childhood. It is one of the few stories I remember vividly despite not having watched it in a very long time [until I watched it again after Wilder's death]. As a comparison, I had watched the remake, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) starring Johnny Deep as Willy Wonka, much more recently; I barely remember anything about it. For me and many fans, the original film is the official film adaptation and the only one we recognize. Although the book is focused on Charlie as the main character, Wilder's Willy Wonka is clearly the dominant character in the original film adaptation. As Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory became a cult film, Wilder's Willy Wonka became an iconic role that defines his career. It is a great children's movie because it challenges the limits of imagination with the impossible wonders inside Wonka's factory, encourages good behavior while strongly discourages poor vices for kids, and features memorable musical numbers. On the other hand, the film and especially Wonka also display some very dark, sadistic undertones that I did not really understand when I was younger. Now that I am an adult, the incredible contrasts make a look back at the movie extremely interesting.\n\nFor my full review, please go to http://rookerville.com/2016/09/02/retrospective-review-willy-wonka-the-chocolate-factory/",

Another standout is Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, his scenes with Charlie were lovingly realised, but in his song, he was just hilarious, and his singing voice was remarkably good. However, whereas Peter Ostrum is perfectly agreeable in terms of acting as Charlie, he is let down by his lack of any real singing ability. Though the film does look beautiful with excellent cinematography and colourful sets, and the supporting characters like the Oompa Loompas, the odiously spoilt Veruca Salt, television addict Mike Tevee and the rather disgusting Violet Bueragarde, are very well done, and the actors are further advantaged by a wonderful sparkling script. The songs are lovely, especially Oompa Loompa, Imagination and I want it Now, though I will say I felt Cheer Up Charlie was rather tedious and slowed the film down quite considerably. Overall, a beautiful film, and I do think it is underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

His quotes throughout the film are deep and thought-provoking, and quite the reverse of their superficial intention.  The tunnel sequence is bizarre, out of place and not for children - I loved it!  It defines the film.  A childrens' anti-film.  Like any classic, I have watched this several times, and am sure I will watch it again in the future.

After recently watching it as an adult all I can say is this - my mind boggles at how so many people consider this to be not merely superior to Tim Burton's 2005 effort, but to be some sort of masterpiece.\nThe main thing I don't like about this 1971 movie is the underwhelming sets. The \"chocolate room\" just looks like somebody's slightly eccentric back garden, the \"golden goose room\" is just a pile of boxes and as for the \"inventing room\" it just looks like a total mess. I realize this movie is from 1971, but I love plenty of movies that have dated visuals.  Mel Stuart's \"Factory\" just looks plain uninspired - c'mon - a visit to this factory is supposed to be the experience of a lifetime, not a tour of someone's backyard shed.\nThen their is the sub-par child acting. This child acting is of the \"learn your lines well and recite enthusiastically!\" type rather than actually act variety. The kid who played Charlie quit trying to act and went on to become a successful  veterinarian: a smart career move since he can't hold a candle to Freddie Highmore. I will admit that Gene Wilder brought plenty of charisma to his role as Wonka which is what I'm giving one star for. Even so, I slightly prefer Johnny Depps's interpretation. I can actually buy Johnny as a person who's been shut away for 20 years with nobody but Oompa Loompas to talk to; Gene is just a bit too socially savvy. I also hate the bit where Gene randomly starts yelling at Charlie; so out of character.\nI understand that that a movie needs to change stuff from the book, but the changes the 2005 movie made at least had a logical point - giving Wonka a back story, for example helps to flesh out the character. But the changes this \"original\" movie makes add nothing to the storytelling and seem like just change for the sake of change. Making Charlie's dad dead, the Slugworth subplot, changing Charlie's personality into a poor version of Veruca Salt - WHY? This adds nothing.\n\nOverall I guess I'm just confused as to why this movie which is mediocre-poor in my opinion is so well loved. I guess nostalgia is a powerful drug for some.",

You would expect that mashing together a story from a children's book, a musical, a number of very dark (even scary) elements, and a comedy would result in a movie that no one could like. Yet somehow it defies expectations and is actually a triumph. There are a lot of reasons for that, and it starts with the magical casting of Gene Wilder. He, in his own natural talent, is able to blend together all those different styles within his characterization of Willy Wonka. He seems silly, insane, caring, and crazy all at the same time. It's hard to explain just how perfect he is for the role, but if you merely watch the boat scene and then the scene immediately following you'll get the idea of what I mean. Somehow he is able to be the most frightening and intimidating man for a minute and mere seconds later he transitions to laughing and joking without batting an eye. I can genuinely sense why Charlie is connecting with him, and also why the other kids are somewhat repulsed by him. Jack Albertson is also a nice choice as Charlie's grandpa, because he clearly loves Charlie to death, but he has a bit of crazy in him as well. As a result, Grandpa Joe is almost the connecting point to help us see how Charlie can like Willy Wonka. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, including an entire collection of surprisingly good child actors, but I think Willy Wonka and Grandpa Joe are the 2 linchpins that make this movie function.\n\nThe music is extremely catchy, and I often find myself humming the tunes for hours after watching Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. However what is most interesting to me is how dark and even disturbing this film can be. As a child I was always conflicted about Willy Wonka because I loved the fun parts, but it was kind of scary (and I've always been a wimp about scary movies.) However, this movie has just the right balance of creepy moments to almost make it an entry film for young kids into the horror genre. In many ways Willy Wonka comes off as a serial killer slowly picking off children one-by-one throughout his factory. Of course all my focus has been on the factory, and I've failed to mention one of the most interesting sections of the film, which is the opening act. It actually takes quite a while before we ever meet Willy Wonka, because the setup of the story is not short. It takes some time to explain about the Golden Tickets and to build up the anticipation of Charlie getting one. Ordinarily this might be a boring section of the film, but they blend in a bit of comedy that always makes me laugh a lot. My favorite moments come from David Battley as Charlie's goofy teacher, Mr. Turkentine. All in all, this strange brew of different genres defies all expectations and becomes something truly magical. It still holds up to this day, and I'm glad the movie-makers were daring enough to put something as unusual as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory into theaters.",

The characters are memorable in this, and for Charlie, he actually had his problems like every other kids which makes him more realistic and make it a bit more unpredictable unlike the remake which makes it more obvious. The songs are catchy and memorable, and it's really funny, especially from Willy Wonka. He can also be very strange which makes little kids scared, but also happy at the same time.

I know that sounds like a pretty deep interpretation, but I found it hard to not come to that conclusion. Besides, the story and characters are so entertaining and immersive that I can easily lose myself in the setting, and this I feel is what a great movie should do. The overall style very whimsical and enchanting, with some zany and colourful visuals, coupled with genuinely amazing special effects. All that is great, but what cements this movie is the performance of every character, and should also mention the musical numbers. Not only are they short and sweet, but unlike most musical numbers, they're actually entertaining. In fact, the musical numbers are some of the best parts of this movie.

If you think about it, Willy Wonka, masterfully played by Wilder, might just be the villain here.\nUltimately, even though the adventure of Charlie Bucket has a few plot holes, the magic of the film covers them with no reserves and no shame.

A fantastic family musically film filled with inspiration and imagination that everyone would enjoy even with the dark tone. A wonderful adaptation from Roald Dahl (personally he despise the movie)a great cast, wonderful soundtrack good storyline makes a movie worth watching.\n\u00c2\u00a0 Willy Wonka thought off a great marketing ploy by opening his factory to the winners of the 5 golden tickets and a lifetime supply of wonka bars. Wonkamania begins everybody wanted one, as the golden tickets are found we see that the kids except Charlie won are brats. The second half is about Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory hence the title name. The fineline of genius and insanity is blurred with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka and his only role Peter Ostrum as Charlie the innocent kid. The movie is directed by Mel Staurt and was release back in 1971 so it is a classic and filmed in Technicolor.The entire movie most of the color were muted except the color red a few other color but mostly bright red (Charlie's sweater).\nNot only the characters and the wonderful props but the\u00c2\u00a0original musical score brings another aspect to this magical movie. Composed by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley it was nominated for Best Orginal Score back in 1972. It is indeed a musical with catchy musical numbers and inspiring songs with a message behind it. Starting with the opening credit to the ending credit an instrumental of Pure Imagination sets the tone.\n\u00c2\u00a0 There are some dark tone like the how world obsession with chocolate early on (Wonkamania)and the tunnel scene which Gene Wilder did a great performance that people on the set though he went crazy by being in the tunnel. It seems that Willy Wonka planned on getting rid of the kids throughout the film\u00c2\u00a0 and what really happen to the kids when they disappeared? Overall a musical about imagination and inspiration with a little bit of insanity making it worth watching many times.Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory shows a possibility of joy for a poor boy.

This is an eccentric fantasy film, one that should be seen by anyone that enjoys a bizarre, story. For fans of the book, they should check this out, and with that being said, I think that Gene Wilder was the perfect choice to play Willy Wonka, and he delivers one of his strongest performances of his career.

The film has strong performances from everyone involved, and is a fun film to be enjoyed by anyone that loves this genre. Gene Wilder, like I said steals the show and he makes this film a truly memorable picture. Roald Dahl disowned the script that he wrote, but I think that it's still a strong picture, one that makes you want to read the book. The film boasts a strong sense of visuals, which are impressive for its time, and it also adds so much to the film's atmosphere. If you want a standout fantasy picture, then this is a perfect film to watch. The amount of musical numbers is fairly minimal, and it's a good thing because it permits to focus a lot on the story as well.

The visuals may be more inferior when you compare it to the remake, but it was made in the early 70's and had virtually little to work with at the time.

The film was surprisingly a box office dud, only making over $500,000'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' is a 1971 belated cult classic film. I say belated because this film didn't really gain a following until its VHS release. The film was surprisingly a box office dud, only making over $500,000 domestically. This news is shocking considering how beloved it is. There are so many great things about this movie. Now, I haven't read this book since I was little, but I know a lot of what was in the book was in the film as well. The book/film has a great story with great messages. You should be hopeful for things you would like to achieve, but you shouldn't let greed overcome you. And considering this is a book-to-film adaption, Roald Dahl, who also wrote the book, wrote an amazing script. Book-to-film adaptations are tough to watch because almost all of the time, the movies fail and are nowhere near as good as the book, but this is one case where the movie is exceptional. This script was actually very clever, not only telling the story well, but a lot of characters, particularly Willy Wonka, had some pretty funny, clever, memorable lines. I have too many favorites to even list.Speaking of the character of Willy Wonka, Gene Wilder did an outstanding job playing the titular character. What a lot of people might not know is that Gene Wilder decided to turn down the role unless his one exception could be met, and it was. That exception was in the film during the Willy Wonka introduction scene. When Wonka tricks the crowd into thinking he's crippled, he somersaults, clearly proving that he can walk just fine. Wilder wanted that scene in the film because if Wonka could trick everyone, nobody would know if he was telling the truth or not from that point on. It was a smart move on Wilder's part. With a semi-large cast like this, you have to break down the performances specifically in some cases. In this film's case, you can break down the performance by age groups: kids and adults. The child actors in this film are great. They clearly portray greedy, naughty children that only care about winning the grand prize. The obvious child star would be Charlie Bucket played by Peter Ostrum, his only film. You sympathize with Charlie not just because of his living conditions but because of how much he wants a Golden Ticket. While his character doesn't make the best decisions in this film, he's just a kid who finally gets to have some fun in his life. The adult actors are also great in this film as well. Excluding Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson portrayed a great Grandpa Joe who you could also sympathize with as well. Charlie's grandparents have been bedridden for 20 years, and it takes Charlie's Golden Ticket win to finally give Grandpa Joe the strength to finally get out of bed. The parents of the other children also have great roles, never overshadowing one another.The one Academy Award this film was nominated just so happened to be the one that made the most sense: Best Music/Score. This film has some of the most iconic songs ever put to film. 'Pure Imagination' is a classic that everyone knows. Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley did a great job composing the songs and score in this film. The soundtrack is easily recognizable and has truly stood the test of time nearly 50 years later.During this time period, there was no such thing as CGI or other VFX we're used to now. Because of this, watching the film in the present time, it's clear that this film severely lacks in visual effects. Obviously, there is more technology in today's world that helps us accomplish this, but considering that this film was released in 1971, the visual effects aren't terrible. There wasn't a whole lot of VFX, but I think the most noticeable would be the great glass elevator flying or maybe even the chocolate river or tunnel scene.Another important aspect of this film is costume design and makeup. Willy Wonka's costume fits his character well. An odd costume for an odd character. The Oompa Loompas have bright orange makeup all over their faces and bushy white eyebrows along with green over-styled hair. Again, for its time, the costumes and makeup are good as well.My main issue with this film is that there aren't enough scenes in the factory, and we don't get to see enough rooms of the factory, either, which is disappointing. The film, which stands at 100 minutes long, has too much build-up to the factory that when we finally see it, we don't see it for very long. Besides this, this is truly an exceptional film, and it's a shame that it wasn't recognized right away.",

The film does have a number of merits, especially the flawless performance of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, a characterisation that is charming and funny at the same time. Another standout is Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, his scenes with Charlie were lovingly realised, but in his song, he was just hilarious, and his singing voice was remarkably good. However, whereas Peter Ostrum is perfectly agreeable in terms of acting as Charlie, he is let down by his lack of any real singing ability. Though the film does look beautiful with excellent cinematography and colourful sets, and the supporting characters like the Oompa Loompas, the odiously spoilt Veruca Salt, television addict Mike Tevee and the rather disgusting Violet Bueragarde, are very well done, and the actors are further advantaged by a wonderful sparkling script. The songs are lovely, especially Oompa Loompa, Imagination and I want it Now, though I will say I felt Cheer Up Charlie was rather tedious and slowed the film down quite considerably. Overall, a beautiful film, and I do think it is underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

Such a simple yet deep concept is so pleasingly intriguing that one finds itself falling into the world half-way through the feature without even blinking. The passion and enthusiasm for such an eerie project is why it works for the most part of it while the rest is left upon its dark humour which may not be hilarious but certainly offers a chuckle every now and then. A gripping screenplay by Roald Dahl, himself who wrote the original book from which it is adapted, and Mel Stuart with his brilliant execution skills ups the ante and easily allows it to enter into the major league. On performance objective, Gene Wilder is stunning and satisfactory as usual and is supported by talented young actors and their humorous guardians. The first act is hilarious and exhilarating and longer than usual (which it doesn't seem so) after which it goes into dark place in its rest of the act but even that tone is so certifiably pleasing that no one minds it despite of being a feature primarily for children. Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory is a golden ticket for the ultimate cinematic experience where it doesn't bother to worry about its diplomacy and rather lets itself sink into its self-created poetic world.",

His energetic performance is by no means different from Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins. He absolutely deserved ,at least, an Oscar nomination. The movie lost some of its sharpness and suffered from some monotony after some time from reaching the factory. But besides the gorgeous production design and cool visuals, there was Wilder's charisma that helped to elevate the movie. The first half of the movie has great emotional value, and established the characters very well. Also, it feature some of the most beautiful songs of the movie. But due to the fast pacing, there was an action in the first half that felt forced, if it was necessary to serve a turning point of the story.There are many powerful and very important messages in the movie. But the greatest thing about them is not actually the messages themselves, as we witnessed them delivered in a lot of movies before, but it's how genuine these messages seem as they are delivered in this particular story.

With amazing acting from Gene Wilder, Peter Ostrum, Jack Albertson, and so many more amazing actors! It has an imaginative story, with a little darkness, and so many little things that after watching this movie so many times, I still see little Easter eggs to this day, And many kids films don\u2019t get any attention out into them and they are bad, this is truly a movie that had a lot of time put into it! This is a gem, and one of the best movies I have seen!",
