            "review_title": "A Sense Of Realism",
            "content": "This is a character study wherein the main character is a small West Texas town, circa 1951. In the U.S., the early 1950s symbolized a transition from nineteenth century agrarian values to twentieth century urbanism. In the film, various people who live in the town must confront the reality that time moves on. Things change. Assumptions of previous generations give way to the untested assumptions of the future. The film's theme is thus American cultural change, and the personal disillusionment that such change can bring. It is a powerful theme, and the film imparts that theme with logical clarity and emotional frankness.In the hands of lesser talents, the subject matter of unimportant people doing unimportant things might have yielded a tiresome soap opera. But the film's script is poetic, the direction is skillful, the B&W cinematography is artistic, the casting is perfect, and the performances are superlative.The story draws heavily from early American individualism. Life here is mostly physical, not mental. Human relationships are direct, immediate, one-on-one. Except for schools, which are given some prominence, cultural institutions exist in the film only vaguely or not at all. For entertainment, people listen to radio, which features the mournful country-western music of Hank Williams. Or, they go to the town's decrepit picture show, where an elderly Miss Mosey kindly returns money to the kids who got there too late to see the cartoons.If the film has a weakness it is in the presentation of a realism that is incomplete. We see mostly stifling bleakness, though that is ameliorated somewhat by humor. What we don't see are the uplifting influences and the optimism that sustained agrarian generations through hardships and rough times.Nevertheless, within the film's story parameters, the film does convey an accurate account of what life was like for ordinary folks in West Texas in the early 1950s. I doubt that this film could be made today. Contemporary audiences have been conditioned to expect non-stop action, loudness, glitz, and overblown special effects, all of which are absent, mercifully, from this film.Low-key, perceptive, bleak, and melancholy, \"The Last Picture Show\" easily makes my list of Top Ten favorite films of all time.",

            "content": "This is a really outstanding film. It is a director's movie, with every nuance strictly controlled by Bogdonavich. It's a sweaty, sad, depressing sort of film. The vitality of the town has been drained by decades of malaise. The kids feel hopeless. The adults go from person to person and have affairs and experience emptiness. There's some depressing football team that can't tackle. But mostly there is a street with dirt on it and a mentally challenged boy who likes to sweep. It is rife with symbols. This boy is trying to sweep away the dirt that is infesting the town, but he has no effect. As a matter of fact, he is victimized by the other boys in the town--part of their fun. We have the contrast of the rich family in town with the Ellen Burstyn character and, of course, her daughter played by Cybill Shepherd. The boys who are in a hopeless prison of the town's making are like a bunch of horny bulldogs. She is the queen in the town, but that's not much of an honor. These guys are going nowhere and she might just be there, like her mother, 20 years from now. The director builds a world that isn't pleasant, but it's certainly a total depiction of a place without a future. The movie theater represents a last connection with excitement and enjoyment. But nobody goes anymore.",

            "content": "A heartfelt, unbelievably frank film on teenage sexuality, it manages to capture the intensity and tumult of the feelings of its depicted young characters superbly well. The cast is excellent, playing each character out in a realistic and moving manner. Timothy Bottoms in particular displays one of the most earnest performances of all time, and the rest of the actors and actresses are so good in general that it is hard to single one particular one out. The film is superbly shot in black and white, which helps depict the entrapment of the characters' emotions, and to really purify the desire to express their feelings. Without doubt this is one of most honest character studies ever filmed, and it just gets better on a second viewing.",

            "review_title": "Somewhat Overlooked Character Study of the 1970s",
            "content": "\"The Last Picture Show\" is an excellent motion picture on all levels.  The film deals with the hopelessness of a small Texas town in the mid-1950s. All the people in the town are down for one reason or another.  The only thing that could bring the town together, the high school football team, is an utter disappointment to all who care.  And now the only shred of hope left in town, the old movie theater, is about to close its doors for good. Timothy Bottoms is a young man trying to decide what he wants in life.  He has an attraction to classmate Cybill Shepherd, but she's involved with his best friend Jeff Bridges (in an Oscar-nominated part).  However, Shepherd is not sure that she wants to spend her life with Bridges so she gets involved with Randy Quaid, a son of a rich landowner, and his friends.  Bridges has the same thoughts about Shepherd and also struggles with his place within the town's landscape.  Bottoms becomes involved with his basketball coach's wife (Cloris Leachman in her Oscar-winning role), hoping that she will fill the void he has.  This does not work and he still has fixations on Shepherd, who somewhat gives in to him during the film.  All in all, there is no real love in any of the characters and they all suffer due to this fact.  Ellen Burstyn (also Oscar-nominated) plays Shepherd's mother, a woman that Shepherd does not want to be like when she's her age.  Eileen Brennan is also on hand as the insightful waitress at the town diner.  Perhaps the greatest connection within the town is the old wise cowboy who owns the theater and the diner.  Ben Johnson (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) shines and when he passes away it seems that the last real glimmer of hope within the town died with him.  Everything in this film is almost perfect. It shows how the lives of people in a small community can overlap and intertwine.  The fact that leaving the town is not a legitimate option to any of the characters only makes the story-line more heartbreaking and realistic.  People who have lived in a small town should be able to relate to this film.  To me this film was very accurate because I have lived in small Texas towns that are eerily similar to the town in this movie.  Larry McMurtry's screenplay and Peter Bogdanovich's direction keep the film engrossing and intriguing throughout.  However, it is the actors that make the film the true American classic that it is.  5 out of 5 stars",

            "review_title": "There are few perfect movies and this is one",
            "content": "Here is a movie that perfectly captures a time and place. The time is the year between November, 1951 and November, 1952 and the place is Anarene, Texas, a small town in north central Texas. The screenplay was written by Larry McMurtry, in collaboration with director Bogdanovich, based on McMurtry's novel of the same name. Anarene is just south of Archer City, McMurtry's home town where the movie was filmed. McMurtry knows whereof he speaks, the movie has the feeling of total authenticity.The story centers around two best friends, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges), as they pass from being high school seniors into adult life. Given their backgrounds, coming from broken homes and living in boarding houses, there is little idea that they will go to college. The movie details how the two handle this pivotal and bewildering time from being on the high school football team one year to being on their own without much of a safety net the next. In a wider context the movie is about larger transitions: from youth to adulthood for the young people, from a frustrated and bored middle age to an even less promising future for the older folks, and from a town with some social cohesiveness to a town dealing with the isolating effects of a bankrupt economy and the advent of television. The rather bleak prospects that Sonny and Duane face parallel the prospects of the town. You are made to think about transitions in your own life.The movie is populated with many finely drawn characters, all acted with supreme skill. There is not a false note struck in the entire movie. By the end we know the characters so well that they seem real. Jeff Bridges was nominated for an Oscar, and I don't understand why Timothy Bottoms was not nominated as well, since his performance is of equal quality. Bottoms plays Sonny with such genuine good-natured charm and honest sincerity that it is hard to believe he is acting. And Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman both won well-deserved Oscars. Kudos all round to the entire cast. The movie is beautifully filmed in black and white befitting the stark settings and story, and the time period. It is filmed as if it were made in the period portrayed.If you have ever lived in a small town or if you grew up in the American heartland in the 1950s, this movie will evoke overwhelming nostalgia. But the story is so powerfully told that I think that for everyone it will evoke nostalgia for a time and place, even for that which they may never have known.The town, as well as the movie, is held together by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) who owns the movie theater, the caf\u00e9, and the pool hall. In fact he owns just about everything there is to do in Anarene, except for watching the hapless Anarene High football team ... and sex. It is no wonder then that sex, in its many faceted varieties, plays a big role in this town, and in this movie.There are so many wonderful and memorable scenes that it would simply require a small volume to recount them. One scene that grabbed me was when Sam and Sonny are at a lake outside of town, ostensibly fishing, and Sam reminiscences about old times, about when he came to the lake twenty years earlier with a lover. Sam makes the comment, \"You wouldn't believe how this land has changed.\" The camera pans the surroundings and it is hard to see how this area could have changed much in the last thousand years, but Sam is clearly attuned to the subtle changes, since memories were impressed on him in a time of strong emotion. We all have clear memories from when and where we have been happy, even if it is a small lake in a desolate flat land. And Sam's specific comment can be taken to apply more generally to the basic theme of the movie. This incredible scene ends with Sam's saying, \"Being a decrepit old bag of bones, that's what's ridiculous,\" and anyone who is not close to tears at that point will never truly appreciate the beauty of this movie.Seemingly this movie should be depressing, but the effect is more of a melancholic look into the lives of ordinary people who are just trying to play the hands they have been dealt in life.It wasn't until the movie was over and I was reading the credits that I realized how cleverly the music had been woven into the film. All of the music is from the time period and is a part of the action and not background music. It is played on home radios, car radios, truck radios, 45 rpm players, jukeboxes, and at a community Christmas dance. The Hank Williams song, heard on the radio in Sonny's old truck in the opening scene, \"Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used to Do?\" sets the tone for the music as well as the movie. There are great songs taken from over a dozen country and western classics from the era. Ruth (Cloris Leachman) is listening to Johnny Standley's quirky, \"It's in the Book,\" (a unique and strangely satirical offering to be popular at any time, let alone reach the pop charts and sell a million records in 1952) during the final scene between her and Sonny.Why is this movie so special? That's kind of like asking why one likes a certain piece of music or a painting. Everything comes together here in one of those magic moments - the acting, the filming, the story, the music, the editing - to create a simply-told and remarkably affecting work of art.",

            "content": "Peter Bogdonovich's great love of film, combined with Larry McMurtry's superior storytelling (he wrote the novel and both collaborated on the script), is in glorious evidence in this elegiac study of life in a small Texas town in the early Fifties. Bogdonovich pays a heartfelt tribute to the America of John Ford and Howard Hawks but the subject matter is contemporary, anguished, appropriate for the time in which it was made. Filmed by the great Robert Surtees in a flat black and white that perfectly evokes the bleakness of rural Texas life and peppered with a fine soundtrack of the popular country hits of the time, Bogdonovich creates a mise en scene understated and keenly observant of the details. It's also filled with McMurtry's trademark mix of humor and pathos. The cast (including Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd, Ellen Burstyn and Cloris Leachman) is letter-perfect but it's Ben Johnson as Sam the Lion who gives the film its center: in an overwhelming (yet masterfully restrained) performance, Johnson unforgettably absorbs the town's despair, loneliness and regret; his short monologue about lost love is delivered with such deceptive simplicity that its power sneaks up on you unawares. One of the great performances and one of the groundbreaking films of the Seventies.",

            "content": "Adapted with director Bogdanovich by Larry McMurtry from his own novel, this film remains true to its source.  A modern adaptation would no doubt have adopted the voice-over approach of narrative, but here each scene is played out from a more objective point of view. The book consists of a series of events played out over a protracted period of time, with McMurtry's sparse but effective prose acting as a bridging device between scenes. The translation to the screen loses these links, giving the film a slightly episodic feel which runs counter to modern Hollywood film making practice. This is no bad thing, and in every other aspect the film follows the book almost literally, but watching it now does highlight the difference between the formulaic approach we are now accustomed to, with mise en scene, plot turning points and climaxes crudely and obviously spelt out, as opposed to that of Hollywood's final golden age, where the director was given more of a free reign to stamp his own identity on the film, and audiences were more receptive to different styles. Here the spirit of the novel is captured perfectly; that of the desperation and claustrophobia of small town life, where generation after generation undergo the same rites of passage, living out the same lives of frustration and unrealised dreams. The films strength is that it never forces us to identify with any one character, evenly distributing the amount of screen time over the different generations and, almost like a fly on the wall documentary (though heavily stylised in its powerfully expressive monochrome cinematography). Coupled with some sturdy performances from all of the members of the cast, and some memorable images, \u0091The Last Picture' comes across as an enchanting, evocative and accessible portrayal of a lifestyle most of us have never and will never experience. Now surely this is what the art of cinema is all about?",

The film also has well-rounded characters that you care fully about, the nostalgic elements are lovingly realised and the re-creation of a long-lost sense of community makes the film so rewarding.

Her father is rich because of some prosperous oil leases. Her mother Ellen Burstyn is thinking she's discreet in her affair with oil worker Clu Gulager, but there ain't any secrets in that town. Shepherd is pretty, but spoiled. She flirts from Bridges to Bottoms, gets involved with Randy Quaid, Gulager and others. She breaks up the friendship with Bottoms and Bridges temporarily and causes all kinds of other havoc.Bottoms is also taken up with his high school coach's wife who also is unhappily married. Cloris Leachman delivers a strong performance there, possibly the best among the female cast members.However The Last Picture Show is known as the film that brought Ben Johnson an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Johnson drifted into acting, he was a rodeo performer who handled stock in several Hollywood films that John Ford took a liking to. He represented in his roles some of the best traditions of the American west as he does here.The tragedy is though he represents a way of life that has come and gone. And that it has passed is not for the better.Peter Bogdanovich as director got all kinds of deserved acclaim for this film that has become a classic. Sad to say Bogdanovich never quite did anything as good as The Last Picture Show.Almost 40 years later, The Last Picture Show still holds up well today and should not be missed.",

Me, well, I'm just glad to have finally watched the entire thing so now I can see what the big deal was about concerning story, tone, and creative output mainly on the director's part. The black-and-white photography is the perfect choice to present this particular story in and the actors chosen by Peter Bogdanovich are aces through and through: Cybill Shepard in her debut, Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Randy Quaid, Eileen Brennan, Ellen Burstyn, and especially, eventual Oscar winners Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman.

            "content": "One of my favorite films is The Last Picture Show.   It is a film that was directed by Peter Bogdanovitch in 1971, yet almost 30 years later it still seems fresh and alive to me. There is a desolate, spare quality to the 1950's small west Texas town we are invited into and its desolation is apparent to us from the opening scenes.  It was filmed in black and white, which enhances the dramatic quality of the town and takes us back to a simpler time.  Just as our lives are discontinuous, with jarring scene changes and ridiculous episodes of embarrassing events, so is life presented to us in this small town.  The film's purposely jarring editing is transformed in our minds, as we watch, from a disjointed amalgam to a stream of consciousness effect that is very lifelike. One knows, then, that you are entering an alternative world just as real in its way as your own.  This movie pulls you in.There is no musical score in this film in the normal sense.  The only time you hear music is when a radio is on or a phonograph is playing in the background.  This lack of a musical score dubbed over the film enhances the illusion of reality.  Another aspect of this sound editing is the choice of music that is being played by the different characters.  Bogdonavitch uses song and artist selection to subtly comment on the character of the person or people who are listening to it.  In the case of Sonny the music he selects is always Hank Williams and it alludes to the hardscrabble life and down to earth quality of his character.   In contrast at JC's home, the manipulative teenager played by Cybil Sheppard, you hear a cover of a Hank William's song that has all of the life sucked out of it, similar to a Pat Boone cover of an Elvis Presley song.  It is a direct comment on JC and her family; her family has grown wealthy by owning oil wells and they pretend they are still the same people as before.  It is obvious they are not just by this simple musical selection.  It is eloquent in its simplicity.\nThe center of the film and the major theme \u0096 should you listen to your heart or your libido if the two don't combine in the same person?  Perhaps the saddest comment in this film is that too often these two halves to a whole do not come together as a package and people are forced to chose.   None of the characters are particularly happy with their mates.  Everyone is on the prowl for that perfect person they know they will be happy with. Time and again they think that they've found the perfect person based on their sexual attraction but when they begin to show their authentic selves are then rejected.   Those in long term relationships with an emotionally compatible mate but with no sexual interest face an equal dilemma \u0096 a lack of excitement and joy \u0096 and are destined to be the ones that reject.   It exposes both sides of this human dilemma, a duality that can become split and non-integrated, and does it in a sophisticated and lyrical way.   Most people experience this split at some time and in this film, as in life, there are no easy answers.  That's why I love this film.And there is Billy, the boy who continually sweeps the street in a hopeless gesture to turn back the inevitable, representing that demented and futile longing for a past that was never quite as good as you remember it.  He represents that longing for an illusion that disappears just as we are about to grasp it and the sadness of that.  The broom that is never fast enough for the blowing dust of time.",

            "content": "In this nostalgic, atmospheric study of small town life in the fifties as seen a decade later, filmed on location in Wichita Falls and Archer City, Texas (from a novel by the incomparable Larry McMurtry), the force of slow, inevitable change is symbolized in the showing of the last picture at the local movie house. That last picture show, incidentally, is Howard Hawks' celebrated Western, Red River (1948) starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift.Well, the movie houses came back to life as multiplexes charging eight bucks a pop, but the Western movie died out, and the boys watching that movie went their separate ways into manhood.Peter Bogdanovich's direction is episodic and leisurely, naturalistic with just a hint of the maudlin. We get a sense of the North Texas prairie wind blowing through a cattle town where there is not a lot to do and a whole lot of time to do it. Hungry women and a sense of drift. Boredom, gray skies and a lot of dust. You could set 'Anarene, Texas' down any place in southwestern or midwestern America, circa 1951, and you wouldn't have to change much: a main drag, a Texaco gas station, a caf\u00e9, a feed store, flat lands all around, old pickup trucks and a pool hall, youngsters with a restless yearning to grow up, drinking beer out of brown bottles giggling and elbowing each other in the ribs, and the old boys playing dominoes and telling tales of bygone days.Robert Surtees's stark, yet romantic black and white cinematography, captures well that bygone era. The wide shot of the bus pulling out, taking Duane off to the Korean War with Sonny watching, standing by the Texaco station with the missing letter in the sign, was a tableau in motion, a moment stopped in our minds.Cybill Shepherd made her debut here as Jacy Farrow, a bored little rich girl playing at love and sexuality. Part of the restorations in the video not shown in theaters in the early seventies includes some footage of her in the buff after stripping on a diving board (!). She is as shallow as she is pretty, and one of the reasons for seeing this film, although in truth her performance, while engaging, was a little uneven.The rest of the cast was outstanding, in particular Timothy Bottoms whose Sonny Crawford is warm and forgiving, sweet and innocent. Jeff Bridges's Duane Jackson is two-faced, wild and careless, self-centered and probably going to die in Korea. Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman deservedly won Oscars as best supporting actors. Leachman was especially good as the lonely 40-year-old wife of the football coach who has an awkward affair with the 18-year-old Sonny, while Johnson played a lovable, crusty guy that the kids looked up to. Sam Bottoms played the retarded Billy with steady, tragic good humor. Ellen Burstyn as Jacy's terminally bored mother, and Eileen Brennan as the wise waitress with a hand on her hip were also very good.Memorable, but perhaps too obviously insertional, are the medley of country, pop, and rock and roll tunes from the late forties/early fifties jingling out of car radios and 45 record players throughout the film.Peter Bogdanovich followed this with some hits, including the comedy What's Up Doc (1972) with Barbra Streisand, Ryan O'Neal, and Madeline Kahn, and the excellent Paper Moon (1973) with Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, but then tailed off.I don't think he ever lived up to the promise of this film, an American classic not to be missed.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "Perhaps the greatest tragedy to befall any artist is to have their life become more compelling than their work; such is the sad case with Peter Bogdanovich whose meteoric rise to fame was matched only by a truly famous fall from favor and a bewildering journey through tabloid hell. (Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers mined the not inconsiderable drama of the first act of his life to sporadically great comic effect in 1984's Irreconcilable Differences. And his tragic love affair with Playboy model turned actress Dorothy Stratten is fictionalized in Bob Fosse's astonishing, horrifying Star 80 (1983). How many directors become characters in films?)Bogdanovich's love affair with film is undeniable, though it has, in the past three decades, yielded far more perplexing misfires (The Cat's Meow, At Long Last Love, Nickelodeon) than unqualified successes. That said, The Last Picture Show is an extraordinary accomplishment and worthy of its place in the list of great films of the 1970s.1971's other important films (Friedkin's The French Connection, Pakula's Klute, Kubrick's Clockwork Orange) are loud, angry, violent and contemporary \u0096 in-your-face reflections of a society in which rage and nihilism, engendered by Vietnam and the growing discontent over government corruption, is the currency of communication. The uncertainty coursing through the veins of American pop culture also begat in equal, if not equally graphic, measure a palpable sense of sorrow at the destruction of a simpler way of life (no matter how \"true\" that memory may be). Like Jewison's Fiddler on the Roof and Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller, The Last Picture Show is a powerful and poignant evocation of the death of a community and a way of life. Thematically rich and imbued with Bogdanovich's remarkable knowledge and passion for film, the movie works on a dazzling number of levels; and Bogdanovich's use of nostalgia and traditional, archetypal genre conventions both enriches the movie and compounds the heartbreaking loss at the heart of the story.His deft handling of a cast comprised of then (largely) unknowns (Bridges, Bottoms, Shepherd) is first-rate and he draws forth superb, often sublime performances from everyone (in particular, Johnson, Burstyn and Leachman). There isn't a false note or a misstep in the movie and there is a naturalness here that is not easily achieved or earned. The great production design (by Bogdanovich's then wife and partner Polly Platt whose contributions to his work and her subsequent involvement in the best works of James L. Brooks should not go underestimated) and the achingly beautiful cinematography by the late Robert Surtees are vital to the success (emotionally, intellectually, thematically) of the film.The Last Picture Show is a truly rare work of surprising depth and emotional resonance; and the heartache for a time and place forever gone and the desperate and quiet struggles of its very real, very human denizens is matched only by the sorrow found in contemplation of Bogdanovich's Icarus-like fall from such exalted heights.",

            "content": "It would have been impossible back in 1971 to predict which of the film's actors would have gone on to bigger and better things. As it was, this was my first look back then at folks like Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, and Cybil Shepherd. Tell me now, who didn't immediately fall head over heels for Shepherd after seeing this flick back in the day? As for Ben Johnson, his role here cemented my admiration of his work as an actor, having only seen him in various support and bit roles in Westerns prior. And for some odd reason, that bit of trivia about Cloris Leachman having been a Miss Chicago in 1946 somehow remained fixed in my mind for all these years. It was compelling to watch her character's appearance and demeanor change so dramatically throughout the picture, no doubt the basis for her Best Supporting Actress win for that year.I'm getting around to watching a whole host of pictures that I saw only once when they first came out, and I was somewhat surprised today to discover how bleak this picture actually is. Small town lives and ambitions crushed by mediocrity and boredom, punctuated by events that in some ways wind up defining the rest of their existence. Depressing realities for people like Lois Farrow (Ellen Burstyn), who marry for convenience and wind up living lives of quiet desperation; she sums it up herself - \"Everything is flat and empty here\". Sure there's a way out if you're someone on the outside looking in, but it's never that easy, is it? One's life becomes entangled and ensnared in relation to others, and the next thing you know, you wind up working till you're a hundred (Eilleen Brennan's Genevieve) to take care of your obligations.The other aspect of small town life touched on was observed by waitress Genevieve - \"A person can't sneeze in this town without somebody offering a handkerchief.\" I don't know if anyone growing up in a big city can relate to that, I myself grew up in a town twice as big as Anarene, that is to say, a village of twenty two hundred instead of half that. It's true, you have a pretty good idea of what's going on with just about everyone else, and the flip side is they know about you too. When Genevieve made the remark, it was Sonny's (Tim Bottoms) first inkling that he just might be in trouble. And the odd thing is, he's never really called on it in a big way, even though each revelation that he's having an affair with a married woman comes as a jolt. Even the coach, as subtle as a brick in a punch bowl - \"You know a man never ought to cheat, unless it's for a good cause\".The film is full of intriguing little nuances like that, masterfully directed by Peter Bogdanovich, who broke from conventional storytelling by filming in black and white, and replacing a traditional score with background music from juke box tunes of the era. The silence during Jacy's (Shepherd) diving board scene is particularly noticeable, until giggles break out as she subconsciously trips up to conceal her embarrassment. A well played scene that looked like it could have come from, well, real life.Aside from the story, I was intrigued by the selection of films playing at The Royal. An opening scene had Spencer Tracy's \"Father of the Bride\", and an assortment of posters offered \"Sands of Iwo Jima\", Cagney's \"White Heat\", \"Winchester 73\" and \"Wagon Master\". That last one was a cool choice, it was one of Ben Johnson's few starring roles. I haven't seen that one actually, I'll have to get my hands on it.\"The Last Picture Show\" won't appeal to everyone, it's a dismally bleak picture for a lot of it's run time. But it's a fascinating one as well, and one of the best examples of pure cinema from the 1970's I can think of. Highly recommended as a movie, and more so as an experience.",

            "content": "The title, \"The Last Picture Show\", refers to the final screening to take place at the only cinema in the small town of Anarene, Texas, before it closes. The significance of this event is that Anarene is a slowly declining settlement where there is little to do and little to keep the townspeople from drifting away; once the cinema is gone there will be even less. In Larry McMurtry's novel on which the film is based the town was called \"Thalia\", but director Peter Bogdanovich borrowed the name of a genuine Texan ghost town.The action takes place over about a year in 1951 and 1952 and tells a coming-of-age story about Sonny Crawford and Duane Jackson, two teenage boys in their final year at high school. Other important characters are Duane's girlfriend Jacy Farrow, Ruth Popper, the middle-aged wife of the school's football coach, with whom Sonny begins an affair, and \"Sam the Lion\", the proprietor not only of the cinema but also of Anarene's pool hall and caf\u00e9 which constitute the town's only other facilities for entertainment or social interaction.Bogdanovich described the film as homage to Howard Hawks' \"Red River\", which is the film shown in Anarene's \"last picture show\". It also struck me as an homage to Martin Ritt's \"Hud\", also set in a small Texas town and also based upon a McMurtry novel. The two films have a similar look, both dominated by shots of the wide-open Texas plains. Both films were shot in black-and-white, something still quite common when \"Hud\" was made in 1963 but which had become very unusual by 1971, only eight years later.The film might look like a movie from the fifties or early sixties, but it doesn't sound like one. Something else had changed in those eight years in that American society had become a lot more permissive, and with the end of the Production Code film-makers could be franker and more open about sex. As one might imagine from a film about teenagers, sex is the major preoccupation of Sonny, Duane, Jacy and their contemporaries and something much discussed. There are some scenes, including one in which a mentally handicapped boy loses his virginity to a prostitute and one in which a preacher's son reveals an unhealthy interest in young children, which could never have been included in films made only a few years earlier.It is sometimes said of Bogdanovich that his early career as a director was harmed by his insistence on casting his then girlfriend, Cybill Shepherd, in roles which were beyond her acting ability. I have not seen all his collaborations with Shepherd, but I must say that this theory is not borne out by \"The Last Picture Show\". Shepherd, in her film debut, gives a fine performance here. Jacy, who comes from a well-to-do family, is popular and described as \"the prettiest girl in Anarene\", but this makes her no more than the biggest fish in a particularly small pond. She knows that she is expected to marry a boy from an equally well-off family and settle down as a housewife and mother, but is looking for more than that, in terms of both love and of life in general. She knows that her mother Lois did just what was expected of her and yet has ended up unfulfilled and miserable, failing to find happiness in either her marriage to Jacy's father or in her frequent affairs with other men.Shepherd's is not the only fine performance here. The whole film is well acted, with too many good performances to single them all out, but mention must be made of Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges as Sonny and Duane, Ben Johnson as Sam, who becomes a sort of father-figure to the town's youth, and Cloris Leachman as Ruth and Ellen Burstyn as Lois, both in their ways lonely, frustrated women.Films, especially coming-of-age films, made in the seventies and eighties about the fifties and early sixties- \"American Graffiti\", \"Diner\", \"Grease\"- tended to take an affectionately nostalgic look back at the earlier period, seen as the time of a kinder, gentler America before the trauma of Vietnam and its accompanying loss of innocence. There is little affectionate or nostalgic about \"The Last Picture Show\". We are reminded that if the young men of the early fifties did not have Vietnam they had their own Asian war in the shape of Korea; in the course of the film Duane joins the army before going away to fight. Yet in a way the Army allows him his only chance of escape from Anarene; most of his contemporaries can see few appealing prospects for themselves in the town, which is in a state of both economic and social decline, yet lack the educational qualifications or the financial means to find work elsewhere.I would not rate the film as highly as \"Hud\", one of the great films of the sixties; the action can sometimes be difficult to follow because of Bogdanovich's fondness of a non-linear style of storytelling with scenes presented to us out of chronological order. Yet when we bear in mind that this was the work of an inexperienced director in his early thirties, \"The Last Picture Show\" can be seen as a considerable achievement. The teenage coming-of-age story can at its worst descend into sentimental clich\u00e9, but here the format is used to examine the American Dream, a dream which can all too often prove illusory for those living in little towns behind the van of time. 8/10",

Since it was the early 1970s instead of the '50s, a decade which saw a lot of \"soap opera\" films, the difference is the language and the nudity.This is a classic soap opera in which just about everyone in the movie is having some sexual encounter they shouldn't be having. This was Hollywood's updated version of a Peyton Place-type small town in Texas back in 1951. That said, there is excellent black-and-white photography and the movie is somewhat interesting despite its slowness, even for someone who doesn't care for melodramas, but the film overall is so-so and definitely overrated. I believe it was a critics' favorite because of all the the shock value it brought at the time. Part of the \"shock\" was seeing a full frontal nudity shot of Cybill Shepherd. Remember, just a handful of years prior to this film, there still was a morals code.Anyway, if you're a fan of melodramas and are not offended by profanity or gratuitous nudity, this is a movie you may want to check out, but don't let all the rave reviews fool you.",

            "content": "Set in a fictional town in Texas, this film is full of imagery of the dying west and the way of classic American life that people in the small town had become so accustomed to. It opens with the shot of a run down movie theatre, then spans the length of the whole run down town, and ends up focusing on a young kid in a run down truck. The situation appears very grim and rather hopeless.The film focuses on the life of Sonny, the kid in the run down truck that we are introduced to in the opening. Sonny is a poor boy, who has been somewhat abandoned by his parents. He's friends with the other poor kids in the town\u0097Dwayne, and Billy most notably. Billy is deaf, and a bit on the slow side\u0097he's Sam the Lion's son and Sonny has a real soft spot for him. Sam the Lion pretty much owns the town. We find Sam and Sonny to have a complex relationship, and one that will end up providing a circular theme for the film. Sam owns the town's pool hall, movie theatre, and caf\u00e9 and is well-known and loved by everyone. What Sam says, goes, and we get this image of Sam as the kind of old cowboy ruling over the land. The town has a kind of old glory day feel about it\u0097the teenagers go to the movies at night and kiss in the back rows, they make out in cars and all seem rather innocent in their naivet\u00e9. However, there are more secrets to the town than are made apparent at first and we realize that this town is far from the perfect image of the west that we have been accustomed to in films up to this point.For example, Sonny gets into a sexual relationship with his basketball coach's wife when she gets too sad for anything else to make her happy. Jacy, the town's classic blonde, ends up being very sexually confused and troubled due to the odd relationship between her and her drunken mother, who is having an affair. The town rich kids are all messed up, having naked pool parties and sleeping with one another. Basically, it's a town that is the result of a changing society with changing ideals. There are a number of times in the film, where the noise from a television is the only sound the audience hears. It seems as if television is part of the changing values of the town\u0097especially after Sam the Lion dies. Once Sam dies, everything seems to take a turn for the worse. He leaves Sonny the pool hall and leaves the theatre in the hands of the old lady who had basically been running it before. Eventually, she needs to shut down the theatre, and even blames television as the reason why people don't want to go to the theatre anymore. Dwayne goes away to the army, he and Sonny get in a fight, and the preacher's son is even arrested for attempting to molest a little girl. It appears that with the death of the cowboy figure of the town, the whole town goes downhill, and at the same time, Sonny seems to be taking his place. He starts rolling cigarettes like Sam had, has his wild days with Jacy (coincidentally the daughter of Sam's old lover), runs the pool hall, and seems destined to simply follow in Sam's footsteps. The last scene, where Sonny returns to the house of his 40 year old lover, there is a loud laughter coming from the television. The conversation is serious, Mrs. Leachman is on the brink of nervous breakdown, Sonny has just witnessed the death of his friend Billy, Dwayne had just left for Korea, and Jacy was off at college. Sonny is the only one left, the last one standing. And the only sound of laughter coming from the sad house where Sonny is destined to spend the rest of his days with a married woman is coming from the television. The wild, wild west has been reduced to people in their houses wishing to be as happy as the people on the television. Instead, they have been doomed to live unfulfilling lives that will never live up to the standard of life in the old time western films in the closed down Royale theatre.",

It follows three high school teenagers--Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms), Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) and Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd)--from their senior year to a few years after.Some people said this is like a soap opera. That is true, but it's a GOOD realistic soap opera. The script is just wonderful (Larry McMurty adapted from his book along with director Peter Bogdanovich) and the characters are like real people. It deals with all three of them coming of age, their first sexual encounters (all of which are played awkwardly--as they should) and dealing with a dying town. It's (appropriately) filmed in beautiful black and white--the cinematography by Robert Surtees is exceptional--it brings the whole film to life. This would never have worked in color.The acting varies. Bottoms, Bridges and Shepherd are just OK--but that's understandable. It was one of Bridges' first films, it was Bottoms' second and Shepherds' first! They were all still learning. Everyone else though is great. Ben Johnson as Sam the Lion is just wonderful and won a Best Supporting Actor for this. Cloris Leachman is heart-breaking in her role and won Best Supporting Actress. Ellen Burstyn has the best lines and is also very good (and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress also) as Cybill's mother. And Timothy Bottoms' brother (Sam Bottoms) has a small part as Billy. It works in the films favor--Sonny and Billy are supposed to be best friends and the affection the two brothers had for each other comes through on the screen. I'm giving this a 10. It's just great--I didn't want it to end. But it is VERY depressing. You probably won't notice until the film is over. A must-see.Avoid the commercial TV print--it's cut to ribbons.",

            "content": "It's sort of hard for me to say it, because I so greatly enjoyed both \"Targets\" and \"Paper Moon\", but I thought \"The Last Picture show\" was a somewhat fascinating but overly self-indulgent film. Its main positive, as far as I'm concerned, is the stunning photography. But for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty (and a kind of hidden beauty, at that). The characters were very hard to relate to or to care about. Basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting, but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story, complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama -- everything from the boy cheating with his teacher's wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on. It was like \"American Graffiti\" without the joy of life.Some might say this film is more realistic -- nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess. But for me the film was simply oppressive, and I want to see it again about as badly as I'd like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in.Maybe this film really just belongs to its time -- perhaps if I'd seen it in 1971 I would have been impressed by its novelty, just by seeing something different on the screen. But that would basically assume that I had never seen anything like, say, Godard's \"Breathless\". Maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film's weaknesses. But in the post-Tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either.It is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth. We see 3 films as I recall in the picture show. First we see Vincente Minnelli's \"Father of the Bride\" -- Liz Taylor's exquisite looks provide a contrast to Sonny's girlfriend and Minnelli's studied upper-middle class milieu contrasts to the character's \"real life\" surroundings in a similar way. Later, clips from Howard Hawks' \"Red River\" emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. It really just reminds me that Bogdanovich is kissing his own mentor's butt, much as he did if I remember correctly by selecting a Hawks film as part of his own on-screen reverie with Boris Karloff in \"Targets\". I guess in 1971 this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems self-indulgent, like so much of the rest of this film.Ultimately, I'd rather see another film by Hawks, Ford or Minnelli than to have Bogdanovich's film remind us of why they were so striking in such a less-than-subtle way. Maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed -- all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation.",

Actually, it was fun hearing songs of my youth once more, especially long forgotten novelty tunes like The Thing and It's in the Book. I'd forgotten about grandma's Lysol that cures about anything when applied behind the ears.All in all, the movie's a beautifully observed elegy on a dying Texas town bypassed by post-war America. The town itself is a dusty husk, almost like an abandoned movie set, except it's not. Worse, there's no sense of future for the youth of the town. In fact there's very little to do except make-out and go to the movies. Of course, the girls won't \"go all the way\" without a wedding ring, which accounts for the many hasty marriages that don't appear to work out well. So that leaves the guys basically two choices\u2014 rush hormonally into married life or join the military. On the other hand, the girls have no choice at all. Hardly, it appears, is this a valentine to 1950's small town America.The screenplay spreads the dynamic over two or three intersecting stories. In the hands of lesser filmmakers the material could easily have descended into teary or titillating soap opera. However, Bogdanovich and McMurtry manage to capture an odd visual and emotional poetry from the damaged lives, thanks in part to exceptionally sensitive performances from Bottoms, Johnson, and Leachman. As things turn out, it's their three characters who are deepened emotionally despite the many dispiriting influences surrounding them. I suspect it's no accident that the most superficial of the lead characters Jacy (Shepherd) migrates to the city instead of reaching out for real relationships. There's a feeling that no matter where she goes, she'll end up like her mom, unhappy. I guess if there's a moral to the stories, it's something about emotional hurt being the necessary price for personal growth.Anyway, in my book, the movie's richly deserving of its many awards. Despite the 2- hour run-time and a general lack of action, I was never bored. Also, kudos to the filmmakers who filmed in gritty b&w and refused to prettify anything, while at the same time, capturing a level of rural life that Hollywood seldom bothers with. Meanwhile, I'm off to buy a box of Lysol to see if it still works.",

A host of other sad characters populate this glum story: Cloris Leachman's wall flower coach's wife, who begins a tentative affair with Bottoms when the coach is looking the other way; Ben Johnson's world-weary cowboy, who serves as a kind of sage to the young boys; Clu Galager's stud, who takes Cybil Shepherd on a pool table (or is that scene in the book only?); Eileen Brennan's salty diner waitress, who I wish was in the movie more; and, best of all, Ellen Burstyn, as Shepherd's reckless mom, who makes us see exactly from whom her daughter inherited her wayward tendencies.Filmed in stark black and white, the film has a brooding atmosphere, and Bogdanovich's no-frills direction perfectly captures the feeling of a forgotten place in which nothing ever happens and nothing ever will. Children and parents alike waste their days away in bored ennui, and both turn to the same things to fill their time: sex, booze and brawling. The children have two choices: turn into their parents, or run away and never come back.It's a shame that Bogdanovich never directed anything else as accomplished as this, because he proves himself to be a director in complete mastery of his medium.Grade: A",

Life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's is pretty dull - which means that a movie about life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's will be pretty dull too! What is it that so many people see in this? Once the last picture show in Anarene closes there really won't be anything to do in town. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that point at the end of the movie. But even before it closes there isn't much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town. You see, there's not much for them to do either - except to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers) or to whine about the local high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing really happens because of that, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) elope, but nothing really happens because of that, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a little girl, but nothing really happens because of that. The only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms) which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town, as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfast.Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, which is intended I suppose to point out how grey this town is, but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors like Bottoms, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (As an aside it was terrifying to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character of Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation movies.) Classic? I don't think so! 3/10",

As is to be expected in this kind of film we get to witness the usual pitfalls and disagreements that are to be expected with a bunch of youngsters approaching adulthood, but I'm sorry to say that I just didn't care all that much for it.The Last Picture show has a metascore of 93 out of 100, but this average metascore should really be taken in context now that we are in the year 2021. For a start, those high scores and reviews would have been penned in the early 70's when a film like The Last Picture Show may have perhaps been seen as being unique and different. However, watching it today I got very little out of it; Jacy is the prom-queen type of girl who can have any guy she wants and gets bored very easily; the type of character Jacy portrays in this film has become tenapenny over the years, but even taking that factor out of the equation Jacy is hardly an interesting character. The same can be said for much of the supporting cast who either seem to play shallow/one-dimensional people or the stereotypical dumb hick types that a person may envisage lives in the southern US states. The only character of some interest in this film is Sonny, but even his story arc is rather weak and almost feels incomplete by the film's end.Slight plus points with the film lie with some of the acting (particularly from the ever reliable Jeff Bridges). The black and white cinematography is good and Bogdanovich captures the era well. Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends as far as I'm concerned; I found the pacing of the film to be appalling, nearly all of the characters were either unlikeable or uninteresting and despite its 2 hour running time the film seemed to have very little to say for itself.Like I say, back in 71 this film may have been unique and different enough to cut the mustard, but nowadays the glacial pacing, mostly one-dimensional uninteresting characters and the somewhat messy storytelling make the film feel like a relic of its time. Judging by the way the critics have gushed over it and its rather respectable current IMDB score of 8.0 out of 10 there is clearly still an audience for this type of film, but it's not for me I'm afraid.",

            "content": "A tale of emotional desolation in a one horse Texas town, The Last Picture Show is extremely well made but did nothing for me. I don't know if it's my age, the age I live in or that I grew up in a small town, but my reaction to this story and filmmaking is \"That's all?\" While I can admire the well drawn themes and characters here, I need more structure than this to really get involved in a movie. Not everything has to be Die Hard or Memento. I just prefer something more than people desultorily floating through an amorphous, narrative cloud.In the early 1950s, Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) is a teenager in a small town so barren, many of the residents seem more like ghosts than living human beings. His life is dominated by his oil rig roughneck friend Dwayne (Jeff Bridges), the imposing local pool hall owner Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), Sam's slow witted son Billy (Sam Bottoms) and Genevieve (Eileen Brennan), the quietly defiant waitress at the local diner. The story basically follows Sonny as he drifts along through Dwayne's troubles with his country club girlfriend, the flighty drama queen Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), and into a relationship with Ruth (Cloris Leachman), the wife of Sonny's high school football and basketball coach. There's also Lois (Ellen Burstyn), Jacy's frustrated mother who hopes her daughter can avoid following in her empty footsteps.It's hard to get too much more than that into The Last Picture Show because this is one of those films when time passes and stuff sorta happens. Sometimes you can't tell if days, weeks or months have elapsed between scenes. This is also one of those films where you wait, wait, wait, wait around for one of the characters to have a big emotional explosion. I only managed to wait and wait before losing my interest in seeing that happen. The acting is very good, especially Jeff Bridges, Ellen Burstyn and Cloris Leachman, and I could appreciate the depiction of people trapped in lives of regret. After about 45 minutes of that, though, I was in the mood for something more. While legitimately artistic, this motion picture isn't all that entertaining.Compounding matters is the passive nature of both the character of Sonny and the performance of Timothy Bottoms. It's easy to see why Bridges and Cybill Shepherd emerged from this as stars and Bottoms didn't, but he wasn't done any favors by being given a role that mostly asked him to cycle through a series of expressions that went from mournful to plaintive and back again with little else involved. You can see the problems with the role clearly in how Sonny engages in a month's long affair with the coach's wife, yet the physical and emotional intimacy with her has no discernible effect on anything about Sonny. If nothing else, the sexual experience should meant something when things turn to Jacy enticing Sonny into a furtive relationship.If you've enjoyed other work by Bogdanovich, you'll probably love The Last Picture Show. If you're just young enough to identify with the kids but still old enough to be intrigued with the humanity shown by their elders, you also might get more out of this than me. I'm not sure there's enough here to elevate it over more recent work with a similar style and temperament. And yes, that includes Shepherd's nude scene.",

The film will never leave my memory because of the brilliance of the script as well as the brilliance of the actors. That brilliance was in no small part as a result of Peter Bogdanovich and the remarkable casting that he did for the entire collection of roles in the film. I am sitting here thinking about what would have happened to the film if even one of those roles failed to jell. But they didn't fail! It was a remarkable feat to, first of all, assemble the cast and then to get such tremendous acting out of them. And for the most part the actors were so young. All of these comments are the product of an older man-I wonder what my thoughts were 34 years ago? The morose feeling of the film; the palpable sense of decay and death were feelings I had in '72 and last night they were simply condensed into admiration for the movie totality that Bogdanovich assembled. The choice of black and white; the choice of locations and the superb screen production-all made for an unforgettable cinematic experience.Juxtaposing the extraordinary decrepitude of the setting with the youth of the actors made for a truly harrowing story. The nature of small town America as well as small town Australia is something that must be experienced to understand properly. I only found out that Larry McMurtry was responsible for the novel from which this script was taken as well as the contemporary screen play for this year's academy award nominated film, Brokeback Mountain, after watching the DVD last evening.

All the while, time is ticking away on their adolescence, and turning their community into a shadow of its former self. \"The Last Picture Show\" was only Peter Bogdanovich's second directorial achievement, which won critical raves so filled with exaltation that it immediately put the noses of his competitors and counterparts out of joint (Bogdanovich was nominated for a Best Director Oscar, but lost). This adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel, by McMurtry and Bogdanovich, is an unblushing look at randy, impatient young people and their elders, most of whom are living in the past. It has a somewhat cynical eye (often for a comedic affect), but also an intimate spirit and a dazzle that sweeps the audience up. You can't help but be moved by it, with those rich, warm echoes of Hank Williams songs on the radio and screen-doors squawking in the dusty wind. It's a touchstone movie, and has stood the test of time. Superlative performances by an amazing cast; Cloris Leachman and Ben Johnson won well-deserved Supporting Oscars. Bogdanovich revisited these lives in 1990 with \"Texasville\". ***1/2 from ****",

Only among them, can you start to sort out which of them are worth using to invent yourselves. To even reach the third level is rare, and if by a youngster, usually generates a hullaballo.I think for the very brief period of this film, Bogdonovich raised himself to the third level. He clearly taps the actors' natural tendencies to project and in a few cases to interact. But that is all we have: emotionally committed performances to no end. There's no underlying intelligence here, even in (actually, especially in) the source book.Many of the filmmakers he says he admires eschew `meaning' but that notion is not only deliberate, but reflected in what they do instead. There's no `instead' here -- and I have to report that this simply is not worth your time unless you study actors.I had the remarkable good luck to see this and `Elephant Man' in the same day. They are both exuberant, actor-centric, back and white films that evoke a sense of place and specific mores. They are both by young talents that were for the the first time being `sponsored' and working to find how to work within the system. `Elephant' employed professional actors who, while relatively unknown were highly, highly accomplished. `Picture' uses amateurs and newcomers for the boys and relatively ordinary actresses for the women.I walked away from `Elephant' with images, some of which are worth keeping (as if I had any choice). `Picture' leaves me with recall of a few tightly crafted situations, but this will fade -- flowers versus trees.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

The story incorporates the adults of the town as the high school graduates are forced to finally coexist with them on more than a student/teacher relationship. It usually ends in disparity. Found this at the school library. I liked this film a lot. I thought of this film as what George Lucas was trying to achieve through the kids in American Graffiti but without all the 60's pop music and muscle cars.

In this final scene, she completely is this woman in the dingy bathrobe, with the uncombed hair and unkempt house. But the appearance is only the icing.  The true strength of the performance comes from the words.  Her voice is at first passive and compliant, but after a moment of awkward politeness, the coffee cup shakes in her hand, and She unleashes this woman's anger, hurt, frustration, and sadness not only for her failed affair with the young Timothy Bottoms, but for all the years of whatever disappointments she has known in this dying Texas town.  The anger passes to calm and a resolution of sorts between herself and Bottoms develops, and she gently takes his hand.  Just moments after unleashing her pent-up fury, she has again become a sort of surrogate mother to this messed up boy.  Leachman seamlessly careens through a scale of emotions, culminating in one of the most deserved Oscar wins of all time.  Yes folks, \"Phyllis\" really is a hell of an actress.",

TCM host Ben Mankewitz is an obvious fan of producer/director Peter Bogdinovich and Peter's movie, \"The Last Picture Show\" (TLPS). Mankewitz aired a comment made to Bogdinovich by Orson Welles...Orson said, \"dont make this movie.\" Bogdinovich should have listened to Orson (Paper Moon aired before TLPS and is definitely a better Bogdonovich choice).Maybe this movie was considered awe-inspiring in the 70's, but I found that Hollywood's depiction (superficial, sterotypical sexual-driven hicks with no redeeming values) of of a small town in Texas to be typical and frustrating.1. What compels Cybill Shepherd's character Jacy to jump off a diving board nude? Why try to sleep with everyone in town including her mother's boyfried?2. The scene with Cybill and Jeff Bridges in the motel room was cringe-worthy (unfortunately Cybill throughout the movie is semi-wooden with no depth...also bad choice to cast your current squeeze - sorry Peter).3. Jeff Bridge's hair drives me nuts. Maybe Jeff was resistant to cutting it ultra short...his hair hanging out of his graduation, and later military cap is downright laughable.4. Movie jumps from one person to the next without having one strong lead to intertwine the (boring) characters. The premise would have been better as a daily soap opera.I could say much more, but I will refrain.

            "content": "The Last Picture Show is an outstanding and overlooked masterpiece that continues to impress to this day. Peter Bogdonovich directed this incredible adaptation of Larry McMurtry's daring novel. It tells the story of a small town in the oil country of west Texas, and the lonely; desperate people who live there. The brilliant b&w photography of Robert Surtees along with the Hank Williams-rich soundtrack capture the early 1950's about as well as you could imagine. We are told the stories of some average folks having difficulty coping with the hands they've been dealt, as well as the emotional damage they do to one another. The film is moody, and it requires an attention span. But if you open yourself to it, you will find it a rewarding experience.Most of the action revolves around a high school senior named Sonny. He's played very well by Timothy Bottoms. He's a quiet and easy-going sort. His best friend Duane (Jeff Bridges) is a rambunctious alpha-male. Duane's girlfriend Jacy (Cybil Shepherd) is the town beauty who loves to tease the guys. These are three confused kids who get along great one moment, then are at each other's throats the next. Like so many young people, these kids are really at the mercy of their emotions and desires. They make foolish decisions at every turn and at times cause a great deal of hurt to those around them.The adults in town are an interesting bunch, themselves. The town's centerpiece is a man known as Sam The Lion. He's played by veteran actor Ben Johnson who won an Oscar for the role. A little speech he gives along the shore of a pond basically won it for him. In the DVD commentary, Bogdonovich notes that it was an overcast day, then miraculously the sun came out right as he was getting into the speech. They almost got the scene in one take, but Bottoms forgot his line about marriage and they had to include a cut. Too bad! Ellen Burstyn, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, plays Jacy's bored mother. She spends her spare time romancing one of her husband's employees and dreaming of a more interesting life. Cloris Leachman, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, plays Ruth Popper. She's the neglected wife of the local high school football coach. She has an affair with Sonny who can't seem to find the right gal his age to date. Both of these women give amazingly real performances.We follow the lives of these individuals for the span of about a year. We share their secrets, we feel their emotions, and we understand their desires. Things come to a head in a shattering final sequence of events. Duane, still distraught over being dumped by Jacy several months earlier, boards a bus with a tear in his eye. The bus will be taking him away to the army, and certain combat in Korea. How about the shot of the bus driving out of town leaving Sonny all alone in the street? Next, a mentally challenged boy (played by Timothy's little brother Sam) is hit by a truck and killed moments later. Sonny and the boy were very close, and nobody else seems to give a damn. Sonny carries the boy's body off the street as a group of indignant adults simply watch. That scene was filmed in one take, and Bogdonovich himself was brought to tears after it was finished. Sonny then attempts to drive out of town, then realizes he has nowhere to go but back home to Ruth who he'd blown off months ago. He sheepishly shows up at her home and Cloris Leachman proceeds to win her Oscar with a tirade about his abandoning her. Notice how it merely takes one sideways glance from Sonny to melt her anger away....We get one last shot of the movie theater, now forced to close. Times they were a changin', but nothing has changed about this film. This is an American classic! 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

This time was already far away from the year \"The Last Picture Show' was released. Now, it seems gone, forever ... Yet there is something incredibly modern and universal in Peter Bogdanovich's masterpiece. It works like a kaleidoscope of all the emotions guided by sex ... The movie follows a group of teen-agers, at a time where the \"notion\" of teen-agers was new. In the old times, you were either a man, either a kid. In between? you went to the war, you started to work ... no studies, no spring-breaks, no disco parties, no fast-foods, no easy sex and all that bullshit. Sex was just marital routine.Those were the old times. The young generation in \"The Last Picture Show\" is luckier. Not young enough to be treated as kids, not adult enough to think of another thing than kissing, hugging each other, and more. This \"more\", Sonny's (Timotthy Bottoms) girlfriend wouldn't allow it, ending a pathetic amateurish relationship where she's being kissed in the theater by a boy who looks at Liz Taylor on the screen or Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) the beautiful girlfriend of his best buddy Duane (Jeff Bridges). Whores and sluts were still owning the monopoly in the sex business. Sex was mystery.In this black and white film, sex is the shadow. It hides, and feelings are hidden inside. When Sonny looks at Genevieve, the good-hearted waitress, you know what he might think of, the looks exchanged between the same Sonny and Ruth Popper is of a mysterious body-devouring appetite ... even Jacy's eyes playfully shine like a little girl with her doll. Boys are her doll. Sex is mystery for her, as she needs to 'know' then to be known as a girl 'who knows'. Sex is publicity. This desire of publicity serves a selfish goal : to be seduced by the right guy, Jacy use sex like a cop uses handcuffs. Jacy is beautiful, and beauty is the least likely quality to inspire humility. And this is what sex is all about : control, pride, for the guy who's done it and for the girl who ... forgive the phrasing, who had been done. And when it's done, it's done. The mystery's gone. And the girl too. Jacy followed her mother's advice, to have sex with Duane, to realize it's not that \"magic\". Jacy's mother, Lois (Ellen Burstyn) is perfectly aware of the delusional aspect of sex ... and for one thing, she was wrong. Sex is magic for a girl like Jacy. So magic she makes it the second time with Lois's boyfriend in a less conventional place than a bed. The irony, a pool table, the very game, her poor dumped Duane was good at. Jacy indeed learns how to play with men. Sex is power.Meanwhile, Sonny, the main protagonist, lives after his break-up an extraordinary hidden romance with the most touching and heart-breaking character of the film, Ruth Popper, the gym coach's wife, brilliantly played by Cloris Leachman. He drives her to the doctor, she comes back shaken, desperately needing an arm to grab, a heart to feel. We get the point, Sonny doesn't, what makes him even more touching in Ruth's eyes. The relationship that grows between them is so sincere, so powerful. He doesn't just fill a gap, he provides Ruth what she needed the most, trust in her ability to be loved. Not as a friend, not as a mother-like figure. True love expressed through these shy movements on a squeaky bed, in a dark room. Sex as its purest, most fragile form. Sex as the expression of tenderness, of desire, of this mysterious sensation that transcends generations. The tears in Ruth's eyes say it all. Sex is catharsis.Yet, this sweet, tender relationship is almost destroyed by Jacy who turns Sonny's head. Jacy is too pretty not to be loved, even though Sonny doesn't love her as he loves Ruth. Ruth gave him her heart, but Jacy caricatured himself by becoming the quintessential trophy girl since she lost her innocence during that nudist party. But it's nothing compared to the pastor's son who showed another extreme: how the lack of sex can lead to more immorality. Sex is perversity. Those are the risks due to too much or not enough sex. Like Ruth and Sonny who'll finally get back together, the movie swings between two generations. And the characters of Lois Farrow and the charismatic pool and cinema owner Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), are the soul of the film. A man and a woman who knew what sex is about. Lois shouts to her daughter \"Oh, don't be so mealymouthed\". Sex is as eloquent for her, as a finger gesture while Sam, who lived a passionate romance with Lois, is nostalgic. He had his time, now it's gone. Sex is disillusion. Yeah, this era is gone. Hearts are as deserted as this little Texan town. Sam the Lion embodies this era with his old cinema where youth kisses in the dark, watching \"Red River\" ... TV is conquering America, there's no time for innocence anymore ... even the dim-witted, good-hearted Billy can't survive this world. Indeed, it's the \"Last Picture Show\". The black and white combined with Hank William's folk songs paint this old classic feeling, the poignant scene between Sam and sonny even has this 'bad' quality that makes the film look older than real 50's movies. Beautiful cinematography incarnating the lost innocence ... which makes \"The Last Picture Show\" so modern, without being cynical, so sincere without being sappy.So, what is sex eventually all about? Well, as would say Sam the Lion, maybe sex is like fish, something we like to eat even if we must spent half our time picking out bone ...",

So basically all the characters have in the movie is each other. Which makes it all the more difficult for the outcasts and those who don't like each other in the very small town. Especially the youth is the victim of this boring place. They are torn between several issues, which all have to do with the transition between puberty and adulthood and they come to the point at which they have to make some life-changing decisions.\"The Last Picture Show\" is a real character movie that is driven by its actors and subtle directing from Peter Bogdanovich. There isn't a real plot in terms of having a beginning, middle and ending. It more is a character observation of several different persons who are all forced to make several decisions and all have in common that they all live in the same small Texan town, in which they can basically only fall back on the run-down pool hall and cinema. By the time the pool hall is closed and at the cinema the last picture is shown (hench the title), all the characters have to make the choices what to do with the rest of their lives.The movie is shot entirely in black & white and made in the same style as movies from the 40's/early '50's. It's quite risqu\u00e9 to make a movie in a totally different style and 'old' style of movie-making but in this particular case it suits the story and movie well. It perfectly captures the mood of the depressing, boring '50's. There are some awkward unusual moments in the movie because of this style (especially in its editing) but I just took those moments for granted, since the style suited the story and the movie so well. Also the cinematography from Robert Surtees, who perhaps in my opinion was the best cinematographer of the '40's/50's and early '60's, is quite perfect.The movie is however a bit too slow at times, even for my taste. Perhaps not really slow in terms of pace but more slow in terms of story-flow and consistency. Not everything that happens in the movie seems to serve a purpose for the movie but then again, life is filled with moments that don't seem to serve a purpose. So you can say that the movie is realistic, just not always interesting.This movie really launched the career of several actors, such as the still very young Jeff Bridges and Randy Quaid. Also Ellen Burstyn is present as well as many other well known and respected actors of that time period.It's a clich\u00e9 but they don't make them like this anymore. This movie is a monumental one that is realistic and powerful but unfortunately not always totally interesting to follow, which regretfully prevents me from rating this movie any higher, even though this multiple Oscar nominated movie certainly deserves to be seen.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "It's like watching an old photograph come to life. Not just a great 70s Western and range-noir, but one of our great films, period.Though it wouldn't go over well today as audiences are much less sentimental, less searching than days past, Peter knew in 71 what Billy knew in 59 and convinced Marilyn of in Hot, that some scripts must be shot in B&W for full desired effect. That effect was an armload of Oscar nods, receipts and critical acclaim for both. The tale of a year in the lives of a small, fading Texas town that centers on two classmates and the knowing adults who shape their lives. Think of a dustier, more interesting Peyton Place.More best parts than the big bucket at Kentucky Fried Chicken. Scenes like Sonny standing in the deserted doorway of the pool hall, wind whipping through the emptiness; every shot Ruth is in; Sam's water-tank testament while Crawford listens like it's a voice from above, knowing he's in presence of greatness with no Super-Bowl rings in sight; the speechless cafe patron (Brown) standing over the boys in plumb digust after their football fiasco; the little girl rescued who almost gets left behind as they haul off the twisted teen and the old guys just keep jawing; Gen letting Sonny back into the cafe and Sam happily signing on and Peter's use of Howard Hawks' Red-River for the Royal finale as a nice closing touch. There are not enough digits on my hands and feet to recount all of the moments, human, humorous and heart-warming.Picture Show is peerless, with Oscar-caliber acts all around, including 1946 Miss America hopeful Cloris Leachman as Ruth-the-Wildcat (BSA-Oscar), Tim Bottoms starring as Sonny (Johnny-Got-His-Gun), Jeff Bridges his best friend (Fat-City Lebowski), Clu Gulager the town Don Juan (The-Tall-Man), Cybill Shepherd (Taxi-Driver) is the good girl with \"a cold cold heart,\" Ellen Burstyn is Jacy's \"smell good\" mom and Mr Farrow's bored wife, Lois (The-Exorcist Alice), Eileen Brennan is the femme swell caf\u00e9 sage, Genevieve (The-Sting), Texas-native John Hillerman is the teach (Paper-Moon Chinatown), Jessie Fulton as Miss Mosey who does her best to keep the lights on (Royal) and real cowboy Ben Johnson as Sam-the-Lion (Shane The-Getaway Mighty-Joe-Young) who reminisces at the water-tank like he exhales rolled smokes, nice 'n easy (BSA-Oscar). The teens get top billing and perform like pros, but it's the grown-ups who bring this one home, their stories, their dreams turned to dust that'll strum your heart-cords.So, thank you Bogdanovich & Company, including author Larry McMurtry (book), Sal Mineo for pitching the paperback to Peter and his then wife, Polly Platt (The-Bad-News-Bears), Orson Welles who recommended black-&-white print, Columbia Cufflinks (Steve Friedman), BBS, Archer City (\"Anarene\"), the federal District Court which ruled the film not obscene (pool scene) and the grand State of Texas (4/4).",

            "content": "In 1971, I was 14 years old until mid December, in the ninth and tenth grade. I certainly recall this film spoken of in high terms by those wealthy enough to see all the new films.And I always thought I would enjoy it. I just recently got a chance to watch it.I knew it would be about small town life, and be a drama. The photograph of the swimming scene where some beautiful nude people are supposed to tease a plain but young girl into stripping. That was the only image most of us ever saw. Later on, this plain young girl would develop as a very sexy mature actress. And even then, she had a good body.So I found it in the library, and checked it out.I probably expected too much. Still, it was very disappointing.It was full of all the clich\u00e9s and stereotypes of the early seventies.Kids grown up in a small Texas town near the start of the Korean War.The performances and production are top notch. It reminds me very much of what was very common, and still is. Poor script with lots of money spent on it, because directors like to prove a point.The biggest trouble with the story is that everyone seems to be the same person, and the person doesn't ring true. It's more like a narrator saying every person is him (or her), unless the person is not to be trusted.A huge trouble with this movie, which will ultimately put it in the waste cans in an hundred years, when the self righteous ones who push this movie down other people's throats are finally gone, is that it doesn't even come cloe to a realistic depiction of small town life. I wasn't around in the early 1940s, but did live a town of about 3000 in the late sixties and early seventies, fifth through twelfth grade, and this was nothing like real life, especially with the characters. The characters in the movie all come across as very civil to each other, like a happy family, and that's a pipe dream. Not a single believable scene in the entire movie. Very disappointing.The movie is very predictable, even for 1971. It also lacks coherence for the first half. We don't know who is who, or what they are doing. It is confusing and looks botched.Sometimes confusion is good, or okay, but since this is a drama, a story, it comes across as poor directing and/or writing, which it is.The story is just a poor story. The only ones who seem to have any soul at all are the ones who are called \"slow\" or \"retarded\". The others all come across as people who think they are in a seventies movie, which looks goofy since they live in the early fifties.The movie is made with a lot of hatred, and makes great pains to contrive things to look like nothing abnormal happens, almost like a writer is contriving a story to show there is no god, but in doing so makes it so barren that only a divine spirit could possibly make it so barren. Like a pair of dice that are rolled a thousand times and never come up \"7\".It looks like an atheist preaching a sermon, which of course means it will be loved by the American public, but it is lame.I give \"3\" to movies that aren't bad, but just bore me to sleep. This one came close, but not quite, so it rated a \"4\".Too bad, because a film about nostalgic eras, about small town life, should have been much better. We're given the huge \"quantity\" here of a big budget, mostly good acting, small details paid attention to, but no \"quality\" of writing or directing. Typical seventies preaching.Mildly disappointing. Perhaps, if you expect the worst, you may be a bit more pleasantly surprised. Mediocre, by any standard.",

            "content": "Here's a quick summation of the movie--American GRAFFITI stretched out over a one year period, set in the middle of nowhere and filled with liberal doses of sex.This is a very good movie in most ways. The acting and writing are superb and the direction is great--no complaints about any of this. However, despite being technically well-done, the film isn't all that pleasant to watch and isn't really appropriate for kids so you might want to think twice before you watch it.First, as for the unpleasantness, most of this was intended by the writer and director. It's all about life in a small god-forsaken town in Texas circa 1951-2. And, while a dead-on look in most ways, it also exposes how dull and awful it would be to live in such a place--at least for modern audiences. To top it off, the film has an omnipresent country music soundtrack that is appropriate to the time and place BUT which will also irritate most modern viewers. Listening to old fashioned country music, to me, is much worse than a film packed with opera or even bluegrass--it's just NOT what my rock-n-roll ears like to hear!! But, there is nothing wrong about this per se--it just doesn't play so well with 21st century audiences.Now as far as the sex goes, the film's themes all seem to revolve around it and EVERYBODY talks about \"getting laid\" or you get to see them in the act (and, by the way, it is incredibly brief and poor sex to boot). In addition, there is some full-frontal nudity and so this isn't a film to show granny or the kids.Despite these comments, I did at least admire the film even if I didn't particularly enjoy watching it. When not having sex or running around naked, the characters were exceptionally compelling and well-written. The acting was universally stellar as well--with Timothy Bottoms a particular standout. As far as sets, cinematography and direction go, you can also tell this was a labor of love--they really tried so hard to re-create the era and create a strong sense of nostalgia.",

            "content": "Last Picture Show, The (1971) **** (out of 4) Peter Bogdanovich's classic is without question one of the best movies of the decade and it's a movie that keeps getting better with age. Set in Texas during the 1950s, the film takes a look at a small dying town and the lives that make up the boring lives there. You have Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) who gets mixed up with a married woman (Oscar-winner Cloris Leachman) and Duane (Jeff Bridges) who keeps trying for the woman (Cybill Shepherd) he loves but instead just finds one heartache after another. As the town slowly dies these two men start to realize that there might really not be too much to their lives. It's said that Bogdanovich decided to make this film in B&W due to the suggestion by his friend Orson Welles and when watching the film you can't help but see the young director showing what he had learned from those masters who came before him. This includes Welles and of course John Ford. These two men have their footprints throughout this incredibly well-written and superbly acted drama that ranks as one of the best of its kind. The beautiful B&W cinematography really becomes an additional character because it perfectly sets the mood and atmosphere in the picture. It's as if you really can feel this town dying as well as the people who live in it. This certainly isn't a very pleasant movie to watch but what makes it so effective is how raw and powerful it is. Bogdanovich's screenplay is perfect as the characters are all given some wonderful development and you can't help but feel as if you know each one of them by the time the movie is over. Each one of the characters are so fully written that you almost feel as if each character is the \"star\" of the picture. You have the terrific Bottoms character who gets in over his head not knowing how to deal with emotions. You have Oscar-winner Ben Johnson as the wise old man trying to old onto the past. The Leachman character is perhaps the most depressing because she's trying to recapture something she's lost. Even the Shepherd character and her mother (Ellen Burstyn) are quite remarkable. All of the actors give superb performances and you can't help but applaud the entire cast. You also have to give the director and producers credit for perfectly matching up all the roles as they certainly got one of the most impressive young casts out there. The mix of new faces and veterans really paid off in the end. Add in the terrific soundtrack full of Hank Williams songs and you've really got something special. THE LAST PICTURE SHOW was daring when it was first released and that raw and fresh appeal is still on display all these years later.",

The performances of Ellen Burstyn, Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman, Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges are just flawless. Even Cybill Shepherd is very good. This is only Peter Bogdabovic second feature and he already knew how to stimulate his actors to get the best out of them - and then catch it on beautiful black & white film. Every shot is wonderfully composed and sometimes, I have to cry just by looking at it. When Miss Mosey announces to the boys that nobody wants to go the movies anymore, I normally can't stop it and cry until the end - for no particular reason actually: It's not just the sad things that happen towards the end, it's more the tone of the movie, its melancholy.That said, \"The Last Picture Show\" is one of the best American movies of the early 70's and definitely Bogdanovic's best. A must see.Rating: 9/10",

            "content": "Peter Bogdanovich's signature film, The Last Picture Show, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for directing, encompasses many different themes prevalent in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The film touches on many different subjects, such as the youth counterculture and friendship. The film follows the residents in the fictional small town of Anarene, Texas in the early 1950s. The main action revolves around Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and his best friend, Duane (Jeff Bridges). Right from the beginning of the film we realize that the town is small and there is no a lot to do. The kids hang out at the local pool hall ran by an enigmatic man called Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) and the local theater, which is also owned by Sam. We find out that Sonny, Duane, and their classmates are getting ready to graduate soon and each kid is having trouble deciding what they want to do after school.Duane goes out with the most popular girl in school, Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd), who enjoys the popularity she receives considerably. Things begin to change in the town for all the kids in town. The coach of the basketball team asks Sonny if he could drive his wife to the doctor's office. We see Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman) as a very unhappy woman. Sonny notices this also and the two begin an affair. Meanwhile, Jacy tries to find a man to whom she can lose her virginity. It is apparent that she really does not want to be with Duane anymore after she ditches him on Christmas in order to go to a skinny-dipping party at another guy's house.All the characters, one way or another, want something more than what they have. Sonny wants a relationship, which he gets with Mrs. Popper, Duane wants his relationship with Jacy to last, and Jacy wants always to be the center of attention. The older characters in the story, Sam, the waitress at the local diner, Genevieve (Eileen Brennan), and Jacy's mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn), reminisce about how things used to be when they were younger and how much things have changed since then. Sonny's world is turned upside down when he learns that Sam has died. The boys always thought Sam to be a kind of mentor. Sam leaves his pool hall to Sonny, who continues to run it. After Duane leaves town, Sonny decides to break off his relationship with Mrs. Popper for a relationship with Jacy. Sonny even gets in a fight over Jacy with Duane when Duane returns. This results in Sonny being injured. Sonny even marries Jacy when she asks him. The marriage does not last long though and we soon find out that Jacy only married Sonny to get attention.In the end, Jacy leaves to go to college, Duane decides to go into the service to fight in Korea, and the last local business, the movie theater, shuts down. Duane, Sonny, and their friend Billy (Sam Bottoms) watch the very last showing of the very last movie shown at the theater, Red River (1948), a John Wayne Western. At the end of the film, Billy is killed when a truck hits him. Billy was a deaf mute, which is why he never heard the truck coming. Sonny is very distraught because everyone around him has either left, like Duane and Jacy, or died, like Sam and Billy. Sonny gets in his truck and drives away from town. It seems as though he might leave but then he turns around and drives back to town. He goes to see Mrs. Popper, who seems to be the only constant in Sonny's life. First, she rejects him, but eventually decides to forgive him and comfort him.This film seems to have all the themes of the movies of the time. It has the rebellious counterculture theme that was so prevalent in films such as Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Easy Rider (1969). It also contains the affair theme also found in The Graduate (1967) by showing Sonny's affair with Mrs. Popper. It has the theme of friendship also found in Easy Rider and Midnight Cowboy (1969). The film also contains the theme of alienation, which pertains to all the aforementioned films. In the end, Sonny is left alone. The only person he has left is Mrs. Popper and his relationship with her is not stable nor is it moral.The Last Picture Show is a film about changes and how people react to those changes. The town changes so much throughout the movie as do the characters. Sonny does not react to change well at all. He seems very devastated when Sam dies, and he is even more devastated when Billy dies. He does not want Duane to leave and he even marries Jacy in order to keep something constant in his life. The only thing that seems constant to Sonny is his relationship with Mrs. Popper. When things get bad, he goes to her. The film is also about the death of the old west. The last film at the theater shown is a John Wayne western, which signals the end of that fictitious and glorified way of life. The film also deals a lot with nostalgia. Most of the characters have feelings of nostalgia. Duane wanted to keep Jacy and marry her, Jacy wanted to stay the center of attention, and Sam wanted to be young again. All of these characters come to terms with the changes occurring in their life while Sonny does not. When he gets scared, he runs to Mrs. Popper for comfort. The film is very interesting and well worth watching. It has interesting and unique characters, which the actors portray well. Just as the Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, \"There is nothing permanent except change.\" This quote seems to describe the central issues in The Last Picture Show to a tee.",

            "content": "Peter Bogdanovich obviously loves the old Hollywood films, Hawks, Ford, Sturges, Hitchcock to a degree, but has also claimed that \"there's Renoir, and there's everybody else.\" This can be seen, in a sense, in how he treats the material of Larry McMurtry's source. The Last Picture Show deals frankly with sexuality, but more impressively, and with more of a lasting impact, on how not being able to deal with emotions leads to a kind of nakedness and vulnerability that is shielded away, particularly in a small Texas town such as Anarene. Not much goes on- sometimes the only thing to do is to split town and see if it'll be possible to take an aimless trip to Mexico in the middle of the night- though that is just on the surface of a tiny town such as this. There's a sense of sexual paranoia, of loneliness, that gets tapped into very well by Bogdanovich on his two main plot-lines: one involving teens (i.e. Cybil Shepherd as Jacey, Jeff Bridges as Duane Jackson, the Bottoms brothers), and their escapism into movies, sports, and sex, and a middle-aged woman (Cloris Leachman) and her lack of companionship, mirrored in her sort of loneliness by the barren side to the town itself, as people move out in droves.From the opening shot- one of the best of any film of the 70s- to the final scene with the screening of Red River, this is a near classic of the period, where there was an overlap between the past films with more of an emphasis on the proud and beautiful side of Americana, and the not exactly darker side but the one people usually wouldn't put on film. It's sometimes very funny (how could finally 'making it' with Jacey go wrong?), and a little surprising in how it gets explicit (pool scene is actually very steamy for a black and white movie), but there's an undercurrent that Bogdanovich doesn't play up too much into the last act, which has been building steadily through the film. Featuring other good supporting work from Burstyn and Ben Johnson, alongside the outstanding Leachman and promising Bridges (Shepherd works best in the role when she has to quietly subvert, as Bogdanovich does more often, with the material), and a true sense for period as well as reality, the Last Picture Show has been fresh in my mind for years now, and I look forward to seeing it again like few other American films of 1971.",

            "content": "This is your only spoiler warning.  What a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered \"Oscar worthy\".I divide material into three levels.  The first is the stage theatre.  Here the viewer is stagnant and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and, most importantly, in the power of the writer.  A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better.  The best playwrights know how to create imagery that the barren stage cannot show.The second level is film.  In this medium, a weaker writer can be used, but the viewer is not sitting in one spot the entire time.  With film, the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing.  Furthermore, film can manipulate everday elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal.The final level is literature.  In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated onto paper, and then re-imagined by the reader.  Far more detail can go into a novel than is conceivable for a film studio.This is why adaptations can go up, but never down.  Novelizations are never better than the base film (see the dime-per-dozen ones at your local book store), whereas the film cannot convey the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR).  Movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies.As for 'The Last Picture Show', it fails.  It is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right.  The characters talk the same and act the same, it's pure futility.  Add to that an obnoxious soundtrack and you have an entirely unwatchable film.I saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians.  The instructor raved about how sad the movie was.  What is sad is how such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious.  Had this been in color the scenes of impotence, the pool party, and the old hooker would be considered great comedy.  Look what Lucas did with 'American Graffiti' a few years later.The American secondary education system needs to start teaching ABOUT film rather than trying to teach WITH film.  Two visually powerful downbeat films: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon.  Rely on them, not this.  It's the 'Last' I want to see of it.  1 out of 5.",

            "content": "\"The Last Picture Show\" is Peter Bogdanovich's greatest work. What does that say about him? Well, he is a master of drama and a director that doesn't shy away from showing the whole picture, no matter how painful it can be. Thats what he does here. A period piece about loneliness and being trapped in a small desert town, it is at the same time a true picture of the 50's and what life was like back then. Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges play Sonny and Duane, two boys on the verge of manhood who are stuck in a tiny Texas town of Anarene, dreaming about life outside of the dusty desert town while watching the picture shows. Sybill Shepherd in her big screen debut plays Jacey, the beautiful girlfriend of Duane who likes to play hard to get. Ben Johnson is their friend and mentor, an aging cowboy who talks about his only true love to Sonny and Duane and explains to them that even though it could be difficult to love her, she was still worth it.It is a strong candidate for the saddest, most depressing movie ever and the ending only strengthens that. Timothy Bottoms, practically unknown to me, gives a strong performance as a young boy/man who is left alone in a practically-deserted town after Duane, played equally well by Bridges, leaves for Korea and Jacey is taken away by her parents. Chloris Leachmann gives another strong performance as Sonny's unwanted but ultimately needed partner. The last scene was beyond words, I've never seen something so strong and poignant before. The cinematography adds a lot to the film despite it being in black and white. It all leaves a feeling of emptiness and despair, a feeling that was not uncommon in small towns in the 50's.",

            "content": "I came back to this movie by way of film historian and journalist Karina Longworth's excellent podcast series \"You Must Remember This\" which recently featured a ten-part profile of Polly Platt, who although credited only for Design on the film, was, according to Longworth and many of her interviewees, in reality more like an uncredited co-director / writer / producer given that she was also Mrs Peter Bogdanovich at the time of the shoot. The Longworth series by the way is entitled \"The Invisible Woman\" which reflects not only Hollywood's attitude at the time to aspirant women in film-making but also her own deference to her then husband allowing him to be seen as the main driving force behind the film, the auteur theory and all that...To be fair, if she actually had just been responsible for design, she'd still be worthy of high praise, as the dramatic monochrome and location work make plain. The movie is set in that austere, grey, post-war era, just before America changed presidents, came out of a \"crazy Asian war\", to quote Kenny Rogers' song and finally saw the back of Senator Joe McCarthy, plunging full tilt into a consumer boom, with the rise of TV and movies having to become much larger and more colourful on the screen with CinemaScope and VistaVision. Set in what almost looks like a frontier town literally DeepintheheartofTexas, there appear to be only three outlets for young folk to have fun, a cafe, a pool hall and a small cinema, all run by Ben Johnson's Sam The Lion, who besides this, seems to impact on the sensibilities of many in the town, especially some of the women and young folk.The main focus of the film is indeed on three teenagers, Timothy Bottoms's sad-eyed Sonny, Jeff Bridges' boisterous Duane and the girl who comes between them, Cybill Shepherd's haughty Jacy, the prettiest girl in town. On the sidelines, literally, is Clovis Leachman's neglected middle-aged housewife Ruth Pepper, who seeks solace with Sonny but who in the end can't compete with Jacy's youth and good looks, despite being a more sympathetic person.The film well captures the slow, empty existence of the townsfolk, all of them trapped but in some way trying to escape the drudgery of their everyday lives. However the only ways out appear to be either death, if you're a boy, signing up to the army (which probably means death again) or if you're a girl, marrying some rich kid in the next town. Bogdanovich's favourite directors were John Ford and Orson Welles and the influence of their stellar cameraman Greg Toland is clear in the deep-focus, monochrome cinematography employed. There are fine naturalistic performances by the large ensemble cast, both young and old, the latter, besides Johnson and Leachman, including Ellen Burstyn as Jacy's faded Southern belle mother and Eileen Brennan's worldly waitress.It's a beautifully shot and played movie, with a near constant stream of country and western music, especially featuring Hank Williams, in the background, only adding to the languorous atmosphere of the place as its citizens go about their mundane daily existences. For its young folk, already struggling with their hormones, the symbolic closure of the cinema shuts one more escape door in their empty lives. They will inevitably turn into the cynical, world-weary, dissatisfied older people around them and doubtless share their regrets at missing out on the bigger picture in life.A deserved multiple nominee at the Oscars, where Johnson and Leachman won for their supporting roles, \"The Last Picture Show\" is a memorable evocation of a way of life I actually suspect is still played out in several similar small towns in Southern America even today.",

            "content": "By 1971, the image of a \"wholesome, small-town America\" was dying out (if not already completely defunct). Probably no movie captures that better than \"The Last Picture Show\". Set in the fictional Anarene, Texas, in the early '50s, the movie tells the story of several young people, their relationships with each other, and their understanding that the America which they know is slowly but surely disappearing; being filmed in black and white gives the flick a real sense of the past. The differences between the children and adults is most likely an allusion to the growing generation gap at the time of the movie's release. Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd, Randy Quaid, Cloris Leachman, Ben Johnson, Ellen Burstyn, Eileen Brennan, and the rest of the cast play their roles perfectly, and this is a perfect movie in every way. Combined with movies like \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\", \"A Clockwork Orange\", \"The French Connection\", \"Shaft\", \"Willard\", \"The Devils\", \"Bananas\" and \"La noche de Walpurgis\", \"The Last Picture Show\" may make 1971 the best movie year ever.",

            "content": "It's 2020 now. Peter Bogdanovich's film 'The Last Picture Show' was made in 1971. The action of the film takes place in 1951 and 1952. It was, therefore, a historical re-enactment of a period from which almost two decades had passed. During this time not only America had changed radically, but also the art of cinema. The sentimental or heroic productions of the 1950s left place to directors' movies in the second half of the 1960s, and a generation of formidable young film directors had emerged, a generation that would dominate the American dream industry for the next half century. Peter Bogdanovich was one of them, and 'The Last Picture Show' was the second feature film after a promising debut with 'Targets', or the third if we count the oddity called 'Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women'. The achievement is impressive. Bogdanovich not only makes a film about the early '50s but also directs the film in the style of the early' 50s. We could say that it is a radical homage brought by the young director to the classic genres and style in American cinema.The story takes place in Anarene, a tiny town in Texas, probably founded during the oil boom, which begins to experience, in the early '50s the decline caused by the passing of the peak of this economy of exploitation of finite natural resources. Winds and dust dominate the landscape. The main institutions of Anarene are a restaurant, a billiard room and the cinema hall, all owned by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), who is also a kind of model and mentor for the local youth. The three main heroes, two boys and a girl, students in the last class of high school live their coming of age with the first loves and first sexual experiences, and especially with many questions about their future that include escaping the atmosphere of the dying city. We accompany them for a year, a year in which their destinies are decided, a year in which the town's institutions disappear, the last being, symbolically, the cinema where the heroes embodied by Jimmy Stewart or John Wayne appeared on the screens and where the first kisses were stolen.The use of black and white film was an aesthetic choice in 1971, but for director Peter Bogdanovich specifically it was an aspect of his decision to use the cinematic tools of the era in which the story in the film took place. The universe of the Texan town, a whole universe with its landscapes, houses, objects are reconstructed with meticulousness, respect and attention to essential details. Each character is credible and many of the performances are exceptional. The youth trio consists of Timothy Bottoms as Sonny, probably one of the best roles of his career, Jeff Bridges as Duane, the first consistent role of a brilliant career, and Cybill Shepherd at her debut, who as the girl which all the boys in his promotion dream of is unforgettable. Ben Johnson plays the key role of Sam the Lion, and Cloris Leachman the role of a mature woman, who compensates for her limited and failed life with a hopeless relationship with one of the young boys. Both received well-deserved Academy Awards for supporting roles. The remarkable soundtrack of the film is composed of tunes of the period, played by prom orchestras, by jukeboxes in the billiard room or in the restaurant, by car radios. On this occasion I found out that the song 'Blue Velvet' did not appear for the first time in David Lynch's 1986 film! Viewed from the perspective of 2020, 'The Last Picture Show' is a snippet of history in history, the history of America and the history of its cinema. For today's spectators it is a trip in time with two stations. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "Released in 1971, \"The Last Picture Show\" is a B&W drama of several teens and adults in a dying Texas town on the windy plains in 1951. Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd play the main high shoolers while Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman and Ellen Burstyn appear as the adults. Randy Quaid and Clu Gulager have peripheral roles.Sam the Lion (Johnson) is the minor mogul of the town, the father figure of several of the boys, who are fatherless in practice, if not reality. Despite wallowing in a dreary pall (which ties-in to the theme), the movie conveys many insights about real life and has some genuine warmth. A couple good examples are when Sam looks at Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Bridges) before they leave for a wild weekend in Mexico or the final scene between Sonny and the coach's wife (Leachman); Sam's reflections at \"the tank\" is another. Furthermore, I respect a movie that has the confidence to take its time without feeling the need to rush to the thrills and titillations.\"The Last Picture Show\" is slightly infamous for its sleaze quotient, but it's interesting what little sex actually goes on in the story; and the quality of some of that sex is dubious, e.g. Duane (Bridges) and Jacy (Cybill). As far as the nude pool party in Wichita Falls goes, it seems that these kids were older than Jacy, except for the little brother swimming in the pool and Lester (Quaid). I'm assuming they were college age; in other words, about 1-4 years older. Regardless, they were the offspring of rich libertines from the Big Oil business in Wichita Falls. Jacy was a rich girl from backwater Nowheresville and wanted to fit in with these bigger city kids.Regarding the realism of the nude swimming, the story takes place in 1951; a mere 18 years later teens were publicly skinny dipping in Woodstock, NY, which is documented in the film of the same name. Do we seriously think a few teens weren't doing the same thing a mere 18 years earlier? For comparison, it's 2018 as of this writing. Do we really think teens today are all that different than teens 18 years ago in 2000? Besides, teens on the wild side were skinny dipping in the 1800s, 1700s, 1600s, etc.At the end of the day, this is a decent adult-oriented drama about the kinetic experimentations & aspirations of youths in the early 50s juxtaposed with the sometimes sad reflections & practices of the adults.The film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes and was shot in Archer City, Texas, as well as nearby Olney, Holliday and Wichita Falls.GRADE: B",

            "content": "THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is a low budget, black and white character piece exploring the situation faced by youths coming of age in a dead-end Texas town in 1951. It's notable for helping a number of fresh-faced actors break into Hollywood; many of the cast here have gone on to great fame and fortune, and yet the film itself is a little disappointing, as is so often the way with these pictures that receive endless praise over the years.This film features more like a television production in terms of scale and I found it quite unaffecting, especially given the fact that many of the characters are self-centred and unlikeable. The exception is Cybill Shepherd, whose breathless beauty and carefully poised character is a highlight; she would later go on to greater things, not least TAXI DRIVER, but she's perfect here, capturing a sense of innocence mixed with desperation.The male characters fare less better, although the acting remains strong. Jeff Bridges plays a brash youth with some heart hidden away inside; Timothy Bottoms does the kind of kookiness that would later serve him well in the disaster flick Roller-coaster. Watch out for Randy Quaid in a small cameo, with the likes of Ellen Burstyn and Clu Gulager prop up the adult cast. THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is a film in which nothing much really happens, but it is realistic even if the effect is ultimately depressing. I thought Lucas's American GRAFFITI explored similar themes in a much more entertaining way.",

            "content": "Here we have a nostalgic capture of times in a small corner of Texas with its ramshackle poolhall, dusty roads and Texaco gas station. This is primarily centered on kids who prodded by youth and sexuality find themselves pushing against the limits of their world, finding it small and flat. It's in the French vein of episodic vignettes that hope to capture playful winds as they blow through life. The town entertainer who owns the movie house is the moral voice and fatherly figure, what you'd expect from a movie by that generation who grew up in them and venerated them as a sort of ideal. Earlier this was an Italian mode of filmmaking, with the playing among ruins of war. This is set roughly in that era, we do have ruins: but they are ruins of time and abandonment seen in the tarpaper roofs and dirty walls, tied to the remembrance of an old West.I suppose at the time, Nixon's time, a big argument against the film would be that it shies from political confrontation, opening up a romantic window to an older time instead of showing the streets now. The Czech were making films of this sort, French inspired, with a more or less covert bite against the regime, this is even softer. There is a war that eventually comes to loom over the prairie and steals one of the boys, Korea. There is adult meddling about love as the cop turns them back on the state line, adult indifference about the simpleton kid lying on the street in the end, pinning the fault on him. It may not have altogether satisfied a pressing need then, but it's all there.The two boys swap fates, he gets married to the other's girl, it's the other who joins the army as a way out of there. The first dream doesn't pan out, what says the second will?The film is most poignantly revealed in this kid who sweeps dusty streets in the midst of dust storms; the street is never going to be clean, but there's something beautiful and right about the perseverance.Yet there is something quaint about the whole thing that hasn't mellowed much by time. We're meant to see that the movies playing in the cinema are a window looking out at a broader world, and yet it's Hollywood's remembrance of one; the last picture shown is Red River, a last hurrah to this prairie. And it's all adapted from a book, the writing is fine but it does feel like something written in advance.The film itself is caught between worlds, trying to avoid actors and clear story but it's always pulled back to them. Cassavetes initialized this struggle in American film, escaping only one of the two, story. What holds this back is the nostalgia itself. Isn't this what manifests when Sonny turns back on the road? A sense of not being able to outrun that place of childhood. We have in the closing scenes a marvelous metaphor about the space of memory, empty walls with particles flying through.",

Having made that bow to pedantry, let me say something else. Rarely has any American director created a film as moving and as unforgettable as The Last Picture Show. Let me go even further and say that this is, in fact the film that The Magnificent Ambersons  COULD have been if RKO had not butchered it. Just as Ambersons is, in large part, a meditation on the changes wrought by the advent of the automobile, The Last Picture Show is a meditation on the changes wrought by the advent of  Television. In addition, it reflects on the death of the old, heroic west, symbolized by Sam the Lion, and the triumph of mediocrity and conformity. It is also one of the most moving accounts of adolescence ever put on the screen, surpassing almost any American film other than Rebel Without a Cause. Let me also commend the lustrous, black and white cinematography, the perfectly chosen score of classic pop and country songs, and the exquisitely  modulated acting. It goes beyond its dusty rural West Texas setting, and succeeds in reflecting the universal human condition. In short, it is more than a great film; it is a supremely moving work of art.

Why bother?Has there ever been a more overrated director than Peter Bogdanovich? The above pictures are his acknowledged classics, films that swept both box office and Oscars in the early seventies, making Bogdanovich's name, and all three are tedious. Last Picture Show may be the most tedious all.Take away the wide-screen and Robert Surtees's competent but inexpressive b&w photography and Last Picture Show exhibits all the style of an ABC Movie of the Week, circa 1968. John Ford, Howard Hawks, or Orson Welles this is not. Bogdanovich has no sense of camera placement, blocking, or spacial dynamics within a shot, and his cutting wouldn't pass muster in a Hal Roach short circa 1921. Horrible \"big head of Pola\" reaction shots are cut into every scene for no apparent reason, other than to get Bogdanovich out of the master. Cybill Shepard's big strip scene at the pool party is a prime example of directorial ineptitude: Bogdanovich seems to have had one or two shots of Shepard, a couple of badly posed reaction shots of the nude skinny-dippers watching her remove her clothing, and a medium-close shot of Shepard fumbling with her bra clasp. This paltry footage is then cut together with no sense of drama, suspense, anticipation, eroticism, or any thing else for that matter, and goes on forever. I ended up laughing far harder at this sequence than at anything in What's Up Doc?. Hitch and Ford could get away with shooting cleanly, simply, and with little coverage because they knew what they were doing, and how to get maximum expressiveness out of minimal footage; Bogdanovich, clearly, does not.Most of the acting is good, and some of it is terrific: the Bottoms brothers, Ben Johnson, just about all of the women. Johnson, giving an excellent performance is, unfortunately, not helped by Bogdanovich and writer Larry McMurtry's penchant for hanging a figurative \"vote for me\" sign around his neck during his big dramatic \"scenes\", which had the effect of taking me right out of the movie.Cybill Shepard is, of course, a stump.There is lots of nudity and sex, but no eroticism; all the sex is bad sex, and bad bad sex at that. The sex scenes play like a virgin's idea of what bad teen sex would be like, if you understand my meaning. Typically, once he found success, Bogdanovich dumped his incredibly talented wife, Polly Platt, who later worked successfully with Robert Altman, James Brooks, Louis Malle and others, for the sublimely untalented Shepard. Fittingly, his career then nosedived after a string of cinematic atrocities such as Daisy Miller and At Long Last Love. It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.The Last Picture Show is proof that there never was much talent there to begin with.",

A film shot in black and white and a soundtrack consisting of songs played on the radio, phonograph and the jukebox.It is about a dying town in the early 1950s Texas at the beginning of the Korean war and television become the increased focus for the viewing habits of the family at home.Bogdanovich inspired by his heroes John Ford and Orson Welles opens the film with the the desert wind blowing through the empty streets of the town of Anarene. A blue collar town in decline where his young have little hope and prospects. All it has to offer is a diner, pool hall and a picture house all owned by Sam the Lion.Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd and Timothy Bottoms are the high school students who ride around in cars, mess about and have inept fumbling in order to have sex. Shepherd is the flirty tease Jacy who leads the guys on but has her eyes set on the rich kid at the next big town. Her ticket to get her out of Anarene.Jeff Bridges as the more cock sure Duane goes out with Jacy, the prettiest girl in town but even he stumbles when he tries to have sex with Jacy who then moves on to Timothy Bottom's Sonny knowing he has been seeing and having a tender relationship with the older and married Ruth Popper the wife of the High School coach.The film despite the stark black and white photography and a cast of veterans that includes Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman, Clu Gulager, Ellen Burstyn, Eileen Brennan is a lot more about the comic misadventures of the young students trying to get laid, a kind of thing we would see a later in the 1970s in movies like Animal House and American Graffiti . Jacy eventually gets satisfaction from an older man on a pool table, the same man who also has a casual dalliance with Jacy's mother.At the end of the movie the picture house does close down, an emblem of the dying town. Jacy has left town to go to college. Duane goes to fight in Korea and Sonny has the pool hall bequeathed to him by Sam the Lion. He also returns to Ruth Popper, a woman he has been mean to as he dropped her like a stone for Jacy. It also gives the film its most tender moment.Despite the harking back to film history this is a daring film made in an era of the counterculture and the abolition of the Hays Code as the film features full frontal nudity and frank exchanges about sex. Just observe the exchanges between Jacy and her mother, who encourages Jacy to be sexually experienced just so she does not get married to someone like Duane for sex and get stuck in a dead end town.",

Basically, set in 1951, the time at the end of World War II and toward the beginning of the Korean War, in the tiny town of Anarene, Texas, we follow a group of young men on the cusp of adulthood. They spend their time mostly going to the picture/movie house (cinema), playing football and hanging with girls, the main characters being senior year high school students Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms), who has and dumps unpleasant girlfriend Charlene Duggs (Sharon Ullrick/Taggart) to have an affair with middle-aged Ruth Popper (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Cloris Leachman), and Duane Jackson (Oscar nominated Jeff Bridges), who is dating pretty and wealthy Jacy Farrow (Golden Globe nominated Cybill Shepherd), daughter of Lois (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ellen Burstyn). As they try continue with their routines and whatever existence they have, Anarene is actually dying a slow death as many of the residents move away to the big cities to get jobs and raise families, and the boys are not sure whether to follow suit. Duane and Sonny have the choice of staying in the town where the most they can earn is the inheritance of the movie house from their legend and mentor Sam the Lion (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Ben Johnson), or of course move away as well to better their lives more significantly, and their graduation approaching makes these decisions more critical. The big blow comes when many of the remaining residents are not attending the second film in double feature showings at the movie house, meaning that it is forced to be closed down, so in the end it seems like the boys have to move on after all, leaving Anarene pretty much completely deserted. Also starring BAFTA nominated Eileen Brennan as Genevieve, Clu Gulager as Abilene, Sam Bottoms as Billy, Randy Quaid as Lester Marlow, Joe Heathcock as The Sheriff, Bill Thurman as Coach Popper and Barc Doyle as Joe Bob Blanton. Young Bridges gives a good performance, as far as I remember Johnson and Leachman are very good in their award winning performances, and the direction by Bogdanovich is pretty good, I will admit that I didn't really see any plot, in my opinion almost nothing happened, but most of it was interesting enough, a fine classic drama.

Sexual behaviour, violent differences between friends and the morality that tries to interject itself in the midst of all this chaos has been around since the beginning of man's existence.  'The Last Picture Show' is set in (very) small town Texas around 1950 and shows a group of people who sleep with each other (with strenuous results that follow) and how daily life can be a challenge among the tumbleweeds, wind, and dust that seems to kick up every time you open the door.  Depression, drinking, drug use and cold hard feelings for their fellow man is as rampant here as in any of the big cities.  Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd, Ellen Burstyn, Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman all shine in a film by director Peter Bogdanovich. Bogdanovich has always been an interesting director.  I view him as someone who was shaken by the Hollywood system and the pressure it puts on its major players and rising stars.  Bogdanovich never really succeeded in displaying true greatness, much like directors William Friedkin and George Roy Hill who peaked for a moment or two but then faded into the background.'The Last Picture Show' has a slow pace but is one great film that has to be viewed to the very end in order to appreciate it as its absorbing qualities will test the boundaries of your attention span and mature audiences will appreciate this, especially those who view and appreciate all kinds of films frequently.",

Still, it has a quality that is beyond a specific period. The coming of age story of two young boys and the small dying town they live in has a universal quality. Intuitively, one knows there are many Sonnys, Duanes, Jacys and Ruth Poppers out there right now.Larry McMurtry adapted his own novel with Bogdanovich. A semi-autobiographical tale set in Texas, weaves a portrait of a group of characters who seem trapped in a place with little hope. Bogdanovich's partner and wife at the time, Polly Platt, was integral in helping create the look and feel of the film, strikingly shot in Black & White by Robert Surtees.The cast is exceptional from the young leads, Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepard, to the older characters including Ellen Burstyn, Eileen Brennan and Ben Johnson. Bridges and Burstyn were Oscar nominated and Johnson won for Supporting Actor. Still, it's Cloris Leachman (also an Oscar winner) as a despondent middle-aged wife who truly tears at the soul here. Here misery and desperation reveals so much about not just the characters, but the weariness of small time life. Leachman showed her brilliant skills as a comedienne on The Mary Tyler Moore Show and in Mel Brooks' films - she was a truly exceptional actress. In the decades since it's release, America has seen many towns just like Anarene, Texas wither and fade away. And, not just tiny places, big cities as well.The reception the film had hugely impacted Bogdanovich. Hailed as the greatest young Directing talent since Orson Welles (with whom Bogdanovich had a complicated relationship), he seemed hell-bent on repeating Welles fall from grace. That's a story for historians to dissect. THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is one of the great films of the 1970s, and it echoes today.",

            "content": "Much like the black and white movies of the 40s and 50s that the characters of \"The Last Picture Show\" attend, the film itself is one of shadows and the ever-present contrast between light and dark. In this film about adolescent sexual awakening, it is only appropriate that the first sexual encounter in the film take place in a darkened movie theatre. It is a sad piece of irony that the teenagers of this dead-end town, seem not to care, or are oblivious to, the escapism movies can provide. Instead, they utilize the cinema as merely another alternative to the backseat. The characters here are so confined to their homes, they seem unaware of the bigger world out there, even in the context of motion pictures. One of them, Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd in her film debut), will escape off to college, so we later understand why she is the quickest to embrace more worldly pastimes, such as the film's now-notorious salacious pool party. If the film gets off to a slow start, we forgive it. Surely it is less tedious for the viewers than it is for the residents of the town, who have been forced to endure its monotony for the better part of most of their lives. Particularly saddening is Jacy's mother (Ellen Burstyn), a woman who allows herself to remain trapped by a failed romance and uses alcohol as her escape. It is Cloris Leachman, however, who gives the film's best performance as Ruth Popper, wife of the high school football coach. The resurgence of her sexuality, in the context of an illicit affair with high school athlete Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms), is in a way purer than any of the couplings of the film's adolescent characters. The most heart wrenching moment occurs in a quiet shot of Ruth alone on her bed, all dressed up, but sitting in the knowledge that her lover has abandoned her to become the latest conquest of high school vixen, Jacy. \"The Last Picture Show\" is one of those films where we care less about what happens, as opposed to how it happens. Very, very honestly is the manner in which events transpire here. Director Peter Bogdanovich skillfully avoids melodramatic elements that would have resulted in a Texas-set \"Peyton Place.\" When the film ended, I felt at though not a great deal had really happened. Perhaps that's the point. In one sequence near the end of the film, while Sonny Crawford is watching an athletic practice at his former high school, an old man approaches and remarks on how much better the team has become since Sonny graduated. Sonny remarks that he graduated one year ago. He too, like us, knows that not much has changed in that year. Anarene is a town that time just happens to. It will always have its Sonny's and Jacy's. Only now, it won't have a picture show for them to go to on Friday nights. Does this really matter? They never seemed to watch it anyway.",

Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be endured in its entirety. This fact alone places the movie high up above and all the way up to the top of his lame filmography.2. Bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some lucky boyfriends can be, by sharing Cybill Shepherd's (his then-gal) fabulous body and breasts with his male audience - and not just on one but on two occasions. Brava! The unquestionable highlights of this cinematic festa del siesta.3. TLPS has barely a scene without stereotypical country music doodling in the background. (Peter tried to make the obvious point that the movie is set in America's Deep South (as if it weren't bleedin' obvious) so he hammered that point on and on and on...) How is this an advantage, you might ask? Well, when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally ceases massaging your tired ear-drums, you start experiencing a strange exhilaration: \"The movie's finally over!\" It's pure joy.4. The movie gives all women who look like Cloris Leachman hope. Hope that they, too, may one day snatch a much younger and maybe even good-looking boyfriend.5. Cloris Leachman's biography (which I realize isn't technically a part of TLPS) gives hope to all women that look like that, that they too may one day win a Miss Chicago beauty pageant. (Provided they have enough money to bribe the jury with.)(You think I'm joking abut Cloris having won a beauty pageant, huh? Well, check out her bio and then we'll see who laughs last...) 6. The movie was shot in black and white which spared us the sight of Cloris Leachman's face in its original, natural non-glory.",

The place itself is like a character in this movie - it is a dying, dusty little town with no hope. And then there are people, living in it, or should i say surviving in there, as there isn't really much of a hope to look forward to in that place. And still they want to love, have sex, to cared about, no matter the age or social difference.I loved the performances in \"The Last Picture Show\". There are some many great performances here: Ben Johnson as \"Sam the Lion\", who won Oscar for his performance. One of my all time favorite Ellen Burstyn gave a great performance as well, much more complex then it appears at the beginning. Then there is Cloris Leachman who also won Academy award. The national treasure Jeff Bridges - great performance as well. I also loved Eileen Brennan (Genevieve) acting, every time she appeared on a screen i could take my eyes of her. And Randy Quaid should have stayed on the screen longer. Timothy Bottoms and well, everyone - this is a one terrifically acted movie. Script was also good as well as solid directing.Overall, \"The Last Picture Show\" is a terrifically acted coming of age story in a goods forgotten place.

            "content": "The Last Picture Show is a very poignant coming-of-age story set amidst a dying Texas town, culturally and economically. That adds a sadness to the story. A sadness about changing times and the new way of life replacing the old way of life. That is a recurring theme in the film. I loved the use of black and white photography, which helps those themes. The film explores many things all teens go through such as exploring their sexuality, keeping friendships intact, graduating high school, and moving on to the next stage of life. The film explores all of those very well. The film is set in a town where everyone knows each other, which in turn enables the viewers to get to know the characters better.Peter Bogdanovich's film has a plot that is hard to describe, other than to say it is about growing up in a town that weeps of the past. Sonny Crawford is the main character here. He was a co-captain of his football team along with his best friend Duane. Sonny just broke up with his rather tasteless girl, while Duane dates the hottest girl in town. Sonny enters an affair with the middle-aged wife of the football coach, thus showing how far this town can get you.The film has many fine actors in it. Timothy Bottoms does an underrated job as Sonny. I really loved Jeff Bridge's performance as Duane, the guy who seems to have it all. Other performances to keep an eye on are Ben Johnson as the fatherly figure and most important man in town, Sam the Lion. And Cloris Leachman as Ruth, the wife Sonny has an affair with. She has quite a few powerful scenes.Overall, The Last Picture Show is a better film than I expected. A beautiful, poignant film about the pains of growing up. The tone is often bitter and sad. We don't often see happiness in the picture, from beginning to end. But we see our characters make most of their lives and that is what matters. All of the sad moments or in other words, the realism influence just how powerful this movie is, set against the 1950's Texas background. There are many great scenes, but I loved the funny scene involving running away from Texas just to head to Kansas. If you want a movie about growing up, this should be your first film to watch.My Grade: A",

            "content": "Bogdanovich used the dusty, whistle stop nowheresville location of Archer City, Texas as the backdrop of this movie. The film opens with shots of the gas pedal and the cracked windshield of Sonny's truck. These imperfections seem to foreshadow the tragedies that occur in the course of this film in that they symbolize the tough lives of the characters. This is one of my favorite films for its poignancy and socially aware theme. \"The Last Picture Show\" employs a host of psychological themes, as exemplified in each character. The roles of the characters are played by Jeff Bridges, Cybil Sheppard, Ellen Burstyn, Clorish Leachman, and Timothy Bottoms. There are also a myriad of symbols that define the action and the dramatic effect of this film. Though we see quite a few of the characters go through their trials and tribulations in everyday life, we don't fully get a sense of who they are. The film takes place in the 1950s, at a time when going to the movies was an industry in itself, but was dwindling by the middle of the decade, what with the advent of television. The closing of the theater in this town symbolizes the social change and psychological impact on a town whose only real pastime was going to the picture show. What does one do in this nowhere town? Going to the movies in the local, broken down theater seems to be one of the only few pastimes that one can engage in in this town.The film examines the rites of passage of the youth that call the town home. We see Duane Jackson, played by Jeff Bridges try to hold onto his girl Jacy Farrow, played by the town beauty queen (she's not really a beauty queen), the sweet and pretty Jacy, played by a very young Cybil Sheppard who bares all in two key scenes in the film. Jacy is pretty, but she's a hollow and shallow girl who is the daughter of a formerly beautiful, but still attractive mother, Ellen Burstyn. The Farrows are the well to do people in town and it seems every man in the town is chasing Jacy's innocent, yet seductive beauty, including Jacy's mother's boyfriend who tries to have an assignation with her in a pool hall.The acting by all the major actors in this film are outstanding, the characters may be one or two dimensional, but it is just such shallowness that defines the genius and talent of the respective actors in this film. Bogdanovich's masterful directing in this film, helped to make him famous. Cloris Leachman plays the lonely, love sick wife of the local football coach. She has a brief love affair with the much younger Duane. Each of the characters is a sort of stock character and cluster of people one might find in such a real life setting.Bodies of water seem to also take on a symbolic role in this film, one being the famous swimming pool scene and the other at the pond which precedes the pool scene. Both of these bodies of water seem to characterize or add to the personas of the characters who play in the scenes containing them. For example, when Jacy strips at the pool party with everyone watching, she then jumps off the diving board after throwing her under garment over the boy in the water's head, this suggests that she has a not so innocent streak in her and that she is just aching to get out of her shell. Later, Jacy loses her virginity in the Cactus Motel with her boyfriend, Duane. Most of the action involves subtle sexuality which to me, has tinges of Freudian symbolism.All in all, the acting is excellent and very convincing and the characters are pretty likable. This is one of the great, underrated films of all time and if you are a Hank Williams fan, the musical scores will delight you, their lyrics suggest the action that is taking place.",

            "content": "\"Disparate souls\" is such a perfect way to describe the multitude of characters in this film. They are people with the most genuine of human qualities and frailties, filled with frustrated ambition and world beaten regret. The town and way of life is dying around them and they are going down with it. Escape can come only through fighting and dying in Korea or through the luxury of inherited wealth.The central protagonist is Sonny (Timothy Bottom's), an awkward, sensitive adolescent who, resigned to life in this small town, embarks in an affair with an older woman (Cloris Leachman) in order to fulfil his sexual yearnings. In his spare time he hangs out with his reckless, roughneck best friend, Duane (Jeff Bridges) and a mute child (Sam Bottoms) at the local pool hall, burger bar and two bit picture show - all run by the grizzled heartbeat of the local community, Sam The Lion.As Sam, Ben Johnson puts in a magnificent performance. Wily and weather-beaten, he brings an over bearing physical and moral strength to the character. His monologue at the fishing tank as he talks of his past and of having no regrets is one of the most perfect moments of cinema. Beautifully framed, he evokes the great cowboys of the past. He is the eulogy of a dying age. It is Sam who is the spine of the film and the man who really binds all the other characters together.Coming between the two friends is Duane's spoilt girlfriend Jacy (Cybil Shepherd) who longs for sexual experience yet is at the same time frightened by her own sexuality. She turns to other men to fulfil her needs, including a wealthy dullard (Randy Quaid) and an older man. As frustrating as her character is, it is impossible not to feel sympathy for her as we realise that she is nothing more than a confused adolescent in the middle of a sexual awakening. Her mother (the magnificent Ellen Burstyn) see's much of herself in her daughter and tries to help her, yet she too is rendered powerless by her own boredom and regret.Bogdanovich's direction is faultless, being at once claustrophobic yet at the same time giving the characters time and space to develop their nuances. The stark black and white cinematography adds a beautiful elegiac atmosphere (not unlike The Misfits ten years previously) whilst picking up the dusty, decaying surroundings in which these decaying lives are being played out. His use of early 50's country music standards only adds to the sense of longing.A bleak and honest look at the underbelly of Americana and the dying American dream, the films foreboding outlook is tempered only by its wonderfully sympathetic characterisation, sexual eroticism and wit. The final scene of the film sums up the previous two hours perfectly... An emotional train wreck dulled by the soft hand of reconciliation, comfort and humanity. Beautiful.",

The town is about to lose its movie theater. Time is moving on and this place is being left behind.The human element that Timothy Bottoms, the main character, brings to the film is the counterpoint to the melancholy of the film. More than another kid in a forgotten town, he rises above the others. His affair with his coach's wife, Cloris Leachman, gives her a new joy in life, albeit temporary. There is the bond with his buddy and rival, played by Jeff Bridges. Finally, there is his anger for another friend who lies dead on the street as the townsfolk stand around his dead body, making idle talk.This is a very sad film but one of the most human and touching of the films to come out of the 1970's.",

It doesn't matter that now, four decades later, we can see so many things out of place, such grand ambitions materialized in such small practical achievements. What matters is that the generation of theorists turned filmmakers made its point get through. And the world followed them. Hollywood spent the decade recycling their own worn out models, and by 1970 they were in dire straits. The new generation embraced the french.Bogdanovich is also primarily a theorist. He thought cinema from the point of view of an outsider, not a practical guy, before he got in. So naturally, among the generation of young American filmmakers, he'd be one of those more eager to transplant the \"french method\" more unchanged. Their kind of deliberately empty writing, characters as part of a certain style, images as supporters of a certain quite yet desperate mood, and only very indirectly of an actual story. Map that into a certain idea of the end of a certain kind of rural, puritan way of life that America was going through at this time. This is something one can feel today, but probably will only connect with the people who know the context. Add to it the sexual passion that Bogdanovich shows for his than lover, Cybil Sheperd. He undresses her on-screen, he puts male characters fighting for her. But behind that we know he's the one caressing her. Their relation in real life affects deeply how the film and her character are presented to us.The trouble here is that Bogdanovich is someone who knows a lot about what he's making, but seems incapable of mastering it properly. He really engaged this crew, the acting is profoundly committed as it is rare to see. But the end result leads no where. I don't mean this in the traditional sense of a story not having a classic conclusion or a clear climax. I mean that the film is supposed to be \"like\" some films, instead of having an autonomous life, even if linked to a number of predecessors. It was no easy matter to be successful in a film like this, and i feel Bogdanovich was really close to succeeding. But he doesn't. At least not in the long run, not 40 years after the film was made.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",

The world is changing, and the winds of changes are not limited to dust squalls only down Main Street, especially for two young high school students in their final year: Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges).Like other small towns across the west, Anarene is dying \u2013 financially, culturally, socially and emotionally. Nothing much happens each day. Traffic is virtually non-existent; heck, there's not even a traffic light. Those who can, leave; those who can't \u2013 like Sonny, Duane and their school friends \u2013 must make do with whatever game in town there is...Which means they spend a lot of time in the pool hall and picture theater owned by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) and the diner across Main Street run by Genevieve (Eileen Brennan). If not there, they're off sparking around town and maybe getting into trouble with the local prostitutes; or testing their mettle, so to speak, with their own girl friends, Duane's Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) and Sonny's Charlene Duggs (Sharon Taggart).While Duane's difficulties center upon keeping all other males away from Jacy \u2013 she being the prettiest girl in town \u2013 Sonny and Charlene break up, thus allowing Sonny to innocently fall into a situation with a much older married woman, Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman), and with the inevitable complications of such a lopsided affair. Hovering around them are Jacy's mother, Lois Farrow (Ellen Burstyn) and father, Gene Farrow (Robert Glenn); a local stud and serious womanizer, Abilene (Clu Gulager); Billy (Sam Bottoms), a mentally-challenged helper in Sam's pool hall; and Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid), who introduces Jacy to skinny-dipping at some rich dude's place, much to Duane's displeasure. How they all interact to resolve their emotional troubles forms the basis of the second and third acts.But the focal point is Sam, Sam the Lion, and you'll find out how he got that name when you see this movie. Everybody comes to the pool hall at some time, and all the kids go to the movies at The Royal, where Sam shows great movies from the 1930s and 1940s. Ben Johnson, better known for his many roles in westerns, deservedly won Best Supporting Actor as the serious, sage and sentimental ol' timer. Equally, Cloris Leachman won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work as Ruth Popper.When I first saw this movie in 1972, I knew I had seen an American classic: picture perfect mise-en-scene, heart-breaking script, beautiful black and white photography that virtually puts you in that time and place, and a group of mostly young actors who acted and melded flawlessly under the direction of Peter Bogdanovich. Wisely, Bogdanovich avoided canned, moody music, allowing instead local radios, juke boxes etc to provide the perfect pitch of Hank Williams and other greats to keep this timeless illusion alive.Forty years after I saw it for the first time, I still think that TLPS is one of the finest American movies ever made.And just like the old saw says, they just don't make 'em like this any more. More's the pity.Highest recommendation for all lovers of great cinema.February 13, 2012.",

The sex in the film pointedly lacks eroticism, and the only couple that finds warmth and connection is Sonny(Timothy Bottoms) and Ruth(Cloris Leachman). Bottoms and Leachman are persuasive and moving, and the film belongs to them. Ellen Burstyn, Eileen Brennan, and Ben Johnson are fine but their characters are too often made to spout life's lessons. Shepherd in her first role looks right as Jacy, and Jeff Bridges is likable and convincing as Duane. Though I find the film a bit too drab, the film has integrity in its refusal to romanticize, and rightly avoids the glossiness of Peyton Place(57). However, not all of the characters or situations here are particularly interesting or adequately explored, and many of the townspeople seem to exist only when the principles are around. Jacy's father is barely glimpsed,and ditto Duane's mother and Sonny's father. Though many of the situations and types portrayed here are familiar from TV and film, The Last Picture Show is admirable in that its portrayal is without judgment or glamorization. Worthwhile film with some memorable scenes. Texasville, released 20 years later, is a pointless and unnecessary sequel.",

            "content": "Produced by Hollywood iconoclast BBS Productions, film critic-turned-director Peter Bogdanovich's 1971 film pays homage to Hollywood's classical age as it chronicles generational rites of passage in Anarene, a fictional one-horse Texas town. In 1951, high school seniors Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges) play football, go to the movies at the Royal Theater, hang out at the pool hall owned by local elder statesman Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), and lust after rich tease Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd in her film debut). As the year passes, Sonny learns about the pitfalls and compromises of adulthood through an affair with his coach's wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman) and a thwarted elopement with Jacy after she dumps Duane. Following two tragic deaths, and with Duane gone to Korea and Jacy packed off to college in Dallas, Sonny is left behind in Anarene, wise enough to absorb the life lessons of Sam the Lion and Jacy's mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn). He is determined to honor Sam's legacy as the town's conscience, despite a telling sign of incipient communal disintegration: the closing of the Royal Theater after a final showing of Howard Hawks's Red River. Paying tribute to classical Hollywood directors like Hawks and John Ford, Bogdanovich used old-time cinematographer Robert Surtees and shot The Last Picture Show in crisp black-and-white, with a restrained style devoid of the kind of \"new wave\" techniques (jump cuts, zooms, and jittery hand-held camerawork) used by such contemporaries as Arthur Penn, Robert Altman, Mike Nichols, and Martin Scorsese. As in such Ford films as The Grapes of Wrath (1940), Bogdanovich relies on careful visual composition in deep focus to help communicate the regret over the passing of an era. Hailed as one of the best films by a young director since Citizen Kane (1941), The Last Picture Show premiered at the New York Film Festival and went on to become a hit. It was also nominated for eight Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay for Larry McMurtry's and Bogdanovich's adaptation of McMurtry's novel. John Ford stalwart Johnson won Supporting Actor and Leachman won Supporting Actress, beating out their cohorts Bridges and Burstyn. For an audience steeped in movie history and caught up in the chaotic 1971 present, The Last Picture Show presented a nostalgic look backward that was not so much an escape from the present as a coming to terms with what the present had lost. Its 1990 sequel Texasville, in which Bridges and Shepherd played later incarnations of their original characters, was not as successful.",

THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is set in a small intersection on the highway Archer City Texas. A look at coming of age, disllusionment and the beginning of the end of innocence. There is the hangout owned by Sam the Lion(Ben Johnson). And there is the rugged carefree Duane Jackson(Jeff Bridges)and pretty and spoiled Jacy(Cybill Shepard). There is the lonely pensive Sonny(Timothy Bottoms)who has an affair with the ignored coach's wife(Cloris Leachman). Filmed in brilliant black and white to take you back to the naive early 50's.Great character development and a slew of memorable supporting performances from: Ellen Burstyn, Clu Gulager, Randy Quaid and Sam Bottoms. Plus vacillating the story is an almost vintage soundtrack featuring: Frankie Laine, Jo Stafford, Tony Bennett, Lefty Frizzell and Pee Wee King.

            "content": "If there ever was one movie capturing a certain place at a certain time, then it might very well be Peter Bogdanovic's \"The Last Picture Show\". It fulfills the function of a time capsule into times long gone like no other film. Where are we heading? To the fall of 1951, the date is the eve of the Korean war, and the place we plan to stay for a year is the small American town in Western Texas called Anarene. One might call \"The Last Picture Show\" a coming of age film, but this is true not only for the teens who are becoming men and women, but also for the adults who feel the weight of their past lives, their hopes and dreams and passed opportunities on them. It is the dawn of a new area. Times are achanging for everyone, economically, culturally, socially, in every respect. Things won't stay the way they have been, and it's inevitable.One of Bogdanovic's very first and best films, \"The Last Picture Show\" has become an iconic depiction of American small town life rarely achieved again in such perfection. Even the director's very own continuation of the story made twenty years later cannot even be compared to this cinematic highlight. The film's forte aside from the strong cast (Ben Johnson, Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd and others), lies in its melancholy, in sketching the shadows that linger below the surface, in the tragedies buried there, in lives they shape and form, along with the aspirations the characters have. All these things are shown without going over the top and thus turning the picture into a melodramatic, overly nostalgic or sentimental elegy. These elements are all there of course, but the emphasis is different - on the realism of it, which makes us sympathize with the people involved, lets us feel at home for a while. Until the moment arrives when the very last picture is shown in Anarene's local cinema, a moment where we might be overwhelmed by a feeling of loss we cannot quite explain. Time then to head back in our capsule, endowed with the indisputable knowledge that things will never be the same again. Fortunately - thanks to this film - you can always come back to pay a visit.",

            "review_title": "Sad, But Incredibly Powerful Movie!",
            "content": "I really loved Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show. This was a film that was never on my radar, but then when I heard about the talent behind the film, I knew that I should check it out. Everything about the film is nearly perfect from the spot-on performances to the masterful direction to the technical side of the film. I very much enjoyed how the movie was filmed in black-and-white. It added to the surprising realism the film showed us. The film is about life and how people try to figure out the meaning of their lives in the rather desolate town of Anarene, Texas.There is no denying how depressing the film can be. It's certainly moody and there is no happiness to be found. The lives of everyone is like living in an empty void. People move on from one thing to the next with nothing to look forward too. This is one of the factors that make this movie so powerful. Also adding to the depression of this dying town is the changing times. The town resembles an old Western town way past it's due date. You understand the reasons the tumbleweed rolling through town. The film points out rapidly-evolving urban centers nearby as people flock to these towns to start new lives. But for the people remaining in town, the old-timers fondly remember the happy days while the young people wonder what to do without being so bored. After all, downtown only consists of a diner, the pool hall, and an old-fashioned movie theater all owned by one man known as Sam the Lion.Something that really surprised me is how much of a factor sex plays in the film. Of course, sex is necessary in everyone's lives. But this film really pulls the strings with that sentence. People have sex with each other in the film because there is nothing else to do. They use sex as a way to get through their rather meaningless day. Except for a few cases, there is no sense of eroticism in the sexual activities. There is this one girl named Jacy who uses her looks to seduce every man in town and there is the relationship between our main character Sonny and the older wife of the local gym teacher, Ruth. After Sonny cheats on Ruth with Jacy, there is a very powerful scene between Ruth and Sonny (that involved chucking a coffee pot at Sonny's head) that shows the deep, real feelings that people did have. The feeling that love actually existed inside of these people.It's 1951 in this small, hapless town of Anarene, Texas. The only person who seems to enjoy life is Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), a father figure of almost everyone in town. Life does not hold much of a future in this town for the younger generation. Two kids the film keeps an eye on are the co-captains of their terrible high school football team; Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges). Sonny is more of the sensitive kind of person while Duane is a brash, outgoing man-but they happen to be best friends. Duane also happens to be dating the best-looking girl in town, Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), the daughter of an oil baron. Meanwhile, Sonny just broke up with his long-time girlfriend who only were together for the lack of anything to do. Jacy begins a pursuit on her mother's Lois (Ellen Burstyn) to find other men that could give her a future. Meanwhile, Sonny begins an affair with the older Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman). These events show exactly how much of a future is left for the younger generation in Anarene.The film has a very strong cast, whom many would go on to have strong careers. There really is not a single standout because everyone gives an incredible performance each depicting their own sense of sadness. If I had to choose the best performance in the film, I would pick Cloris Leachman as the unhappy wife who begins an affair. That fore-mentioned scene in the argument with Sonny is very powerful. Ben Johnson would be a very close second as Sam the Lion. He's a stern man content with life in the town, but he understands the plight of the young ones. His scene where he takes Sonny out fishing and reminisces on his younger life concerning love actually brought a few tears to my eyes. There is Jeff Bridges, who gave a very steady performance and despite his young age, he already held a commanding presence on screen. Cybill Shepherd was an unrecognizable name at the time, but her sexual turn as Jacy opened up some eyes. Ellen Burstyn likewise as her mother.Also, I have to mention the cinematography, which was used in black-and-white. That gave to the overall realism of the movie. But it is the little things on camera that showed the emptiness of the town. Whether its the tumbleweed, the dust blowing the air, the sad faces of everyone, the broken-down cars, etc. Everything that was shot, in some shape or form, showed what life was in this town.Overall, The Last Picture Show is a bleak, sad movie that is nonetheless a very powerful feature that is masterfully directed by Peter Bogdanovich and brilliantly adapted to the screen by Bogdanovich as well. He gets powerful performances from everyone in the film, and that is a rare feat for a young director. It goes to show that growing up is not all golden and wonderful as some people struggle to live because of the area they reside in. This is surprisingly a very powerful film and one of my favorites from 1971.My Grade: A",

            "content": "*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy It Used ****-Worthy of a Blind BuyThe Last Picture Show has been somewhat unattainable to me in the past year. I had heard about it through IMDB and was interested in seeing it. However, due to the fact that my local Family Video did not carry the film it drifted into the back of my mind. I joined Netflix last week and seized the opportunity to see this film. The Last Picture Show is a film about a small town in Texas in the 1950's. Anarene, Texas is desolate and on the verge of becoming a ghost town. The teenagers in the town only have movies to keep them entertained. However, since the theatre is closing there seems to be a lot less to do. Timothy Bottoms is Sonny Crawford, the innocent teenager who is given the town's poolhall and finds himself becoming a lifelong citizen of Anarene. Jeff Bridges is Duane Jackson, captain of the football team and dating the prettiest girl in town. Duane and Sonny are best friends and are both sick of the small town. Cybill Shepard makes her career debut as the beautiful Jacy Farrow. Jacy is the popular homecoming queen who is changing into the woman her mother has become. All the performances are great and really get the point across. This is a very character driven film and the lives of the characters are handled with care. As the story progresses through football and basketball seasons and then towards graduation the characters change. They make choices that effect their futures. Sonny is the main focus of the film as he goes through losing a mentor, having an affair with his coach's wife, and nearly distroying his friendship with Duane. You feel sorrow for Sonny as he ends one chapter of his life to begin another in the same place he was before. He is trapped in the town with no clear way of escaping. The script was adapted by Larry McMurtry and Peter Bogdanovich from a novel by the former. Bogdanovich also directed it. The direction in this film is as engrossing and interesting to watch as the story being told. All the shots, save for one, were filmed at eye-level which I think makes the film more personal and small.\nOverall, I enjoyed the film. It was a well made character study that portrays the loneliness and boredom that surround the characters as they are confined to the small town. I rate it *** because it feels real in it's portrayal of small town life in the 50's.",

            "review_title": "An excellent film which explores the sad lives of people in a town that has lost all reason to exist",
            "content": "Based on the 1966 novel of the same name by Larry McMurtry, this is an excellent, often moving and occasionally depressing coming of age film. Taking place from November 1951 to October 1952, it concerns the bleak, desolate little town of Anarene, Texas which has been slowly dying for years and its inhabitants' sad, unfulfilled lives of wasted potential. What a great feel good film for the Christmas season! The film has an extremely strong script by McMurtry and Peter Bogdanovich while Bogdanovich's direction hits all of the right notes. The beautiful black-and-white cinematography of Robert Surtees captures the look and feel of an early 1950s film very effectively but the same could hardly be said of the content as even its milder aspects would have fallen foul of the Hays Code. The film is permeated by a heavy sense of regret. In some respects, it reminded me of \"The Third Man\" in that its grim setting reflected the damaged lives of its characters. The film is basically an elegy to a dying town.The film stars Timothy Bottoms in a great performance as Sonny Crawford, a high school senior and one of the better adjusted, comparatively speaking, characters. In the beginning, Sonny is listless and is simply going through the motions with his girlfriend of a year Charlene Duggs so he breaks up with her. Like many of the townspeople, he feels as if there is something missing from his life and that he has no reason to live in Anarene other than that he is already there. After his high school coach Coach Popper asks him to drive her to the hospital, he begins an affair with his wife Ruth, played in a wonderful performance by Cloris Leachman. Ruth is severely depressed because of her poor and unsatisfying relationship with her husband - who is hinted to be gay - and finds solace in the arms of the much younger Sonny. As Anarene is a town where everyone knows everyone else and, more to the point, everyone else's business, their affair becomes an open secret but it is left ambiguous whether Coach Popper knows or even cares. After six months, Sonny abandons Ruth for a girl his own age named Jacy Farrow, which leads to Ruth becomes even more depressed. At the end of the film, however, he returns to her. He does so because he is upset and has nowhere else to go but he does seem truly remorseful. Sonny makes some serious mistakes but I do think that he is a good person. In a rather upsetting scene, his friends hire a prostitute for a younger boy named Billy who suffers from intellectual disabilities, ostensibly so he can lose his virginity but really for their own amusement. Sonny initially goes along with the plan, which does not go well. However, he is the only one to take sympathy on Billy afterwards and to apologise as he is very fond and protective of him. Appropriately enough, Billy was played by Bottoms' younger brother Sam.For his ten minute role as the local institution Sam the Lion, Ben Johnson won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar and it is easy to see why. In one of the film's best scenes which won him the Oscar, Sam recalls his failed relationship with his one true love in a beautifully written and performed speech which is imbued with loss and regret. He comments that about 80% of marriages are miserable which would be very depressing but, by Anarene standards, he is probably being a little optimistic. Ellen Burstyn gives one of the best performances as Jacy's mother Lois Farrow, a rich but unhappy housewife who has numerous affairs, most notably with her husband's employee Abilene. She deserved the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. As her daughter, Cybill Shepherd is very good. Jacy is an interesting character as she is very manipulative. When a rich boy named Bobby Sheen refuses to have sex with her because she is a virgin, she finally agrees to have sex with her longtime boyfriend Duane Jackson, only to dump him almost immediately afterwards. Things do not go according to plan, however, as Bobby has gotten married in the meantime. Out of sheer boredom, she follows in her mother's footsteps and has sex with Abilene herself but that does not work out either. She then pursues a relationship with Sonny and, after a while, proposes that they get married. While Sonny certainly has feelings for her, he does not love her but nevertheless agrees. However, it turns out after she left a note to her parents telling them of their elopement and the marriage is not even consummated. She apparently only married Sonny for the thrill of disobeying her parents. Even her mother tells Sonny that he was better off with Ruth. Jeff Bridges is very good as Duane but I am surprised that he was likewise nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as I don't think that his performance was on that level. The film also features nice appearances from Clu Glulager as Abilene, Eileen Brennan as the world weary waitress Genevieve and Randy Quaid as the rather creepy rich boy Lester Marlow.Overall, this is an excellent film which explores the sad lives of people in a town that has lost all reason to exist. It was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and deservedly so. One thing that I found very interesting about the numerous sex scenes is that they are all humiliating, either during the event or afterwards. In this sense, the characters' sex lives reflect every other aspect of their lives in Anarene. Towards the end of the film, the cinema shuts down and this marks the end of the town's cultural life. When Sam the Lion died, he took the town with him. It just took a few extra months to die.",

The film does not have any particular plot, but rather tries to present the grayness of everyday life of people in a hopeless environment. This atmosphere is largely contributed by the black and white technique and the absence of a music background. Music in the film only occurs when the characters listen to it on the radio, jukebox and the like. In the seventies, it caused controversy because of, for its time, explicit nudity and teenage sex as one of the main motives, but the movie is so depressing that even a sex desire is cut off at the root.The film won two Oscars, out of eight nominations, as well as many other awards, and is considered one of the best American achievements of the seventies, but, although intellectually I realize its greatness, it did not leave a particularly strong impression on me.

Mind-numbing small town malaise I suppose is what it's called.I'm not going to go through the entire movie as most everyone here has done that. But one character that I think of more often as I get old is Ben Johnson's portrayal of Sam The Lion.Honestly, I can't think of many other characters in American film history who have had more of an impact on me than Sam. Wise, low-key, and noticing everything and saying not much about it, he is an amazing character. You can see The Lion in him even at this late date in his life when we meet him, when he's swigging cough syrup to fight a hack though still rolling his own cigarettes. Still not a man you'd want to tussle with at all.The scene at the water hole when he takes Billy, the mute young boy he takes care of tho it's never explained why, and Sonny fishing is a scene that comes to my mind often. He expels enough of life's wisdom in that scene to last you a lifetime.Johnson was the perfect choice as he was a real cowboy in Oklahoma before lucking into a horse wrangling on a Howard Hughes movie and found that it paid a whole lot better than the real cowboying he'd been doing.

            "content": "This is a great picture based upon a great book.The title of both gets immediately to the heart of things.The book establishes the probability that after Sam the lion & Lois Farrow, Sonny Crawford, of the following generation, is the most intelligent person in Anarene, the fictional Texas small town.For me, the premise of author Larry McMurtry's novel is the source of the greatness of this coming-of-age story. As everyone knows, the title refers to the closing of The Royal, the movie house in downtown Anarene. The location is becoming a ghost town as Mrs. Mosey, the theater's operator, reveals to best buddies Sonny & Duane her intention to shutter the place after one last unspooling of \"Red River.\" It's the night before Duane goes off to fight in Korea.The deeper, subtler meaning of the title refers to the process of growing up mentally, which means seeing beyond Hollywood-fueled fantasies about what life is supposed to be in favor of clear-eyed visions of what is your own real life in actuality.At the center of the story is the trio of Sonny, Duane & Jacy, the girl. There's a late-blooming triangle of competition between the two boys seeking the love of Jacy, their (and everyone else's) dream girl in the flesh. Duane gives everything he's got to the winning of Jacy, whereas Sonny, who never expected to get his chance with her, finally does, but only after falling in love with Ruth Popper, the forty-year-old abandoned wife of the macho but gay high school physical education teacher.Jacy is the villain of the story because she's a very smart schemer who tries, almost diabolically, to realize in the flesh the dreamy scenarios that fill her head in the wake of countless trips to the matin\u00e9e. Her real life is her enemy because it keeps refusing to conform itself to her Hollywood-laced mental picture of how things are supposed to be. She's the most beautiful girl in town and she's a seductress and yet, actually, she doesn't even like sex, that is, not real sex as sharply distinguished from what she's seen in the movies.Duane, a mostly good-natured guy with strength & athletic prowess, in accordance with the standard movie scenario, figures to be the best match for Jacy. Throughout most of the story, he's got a white-knuckle grip on this dream & his insane jealousy where Jacy's concerned turns him into a violent loose cannon who almost wrecks his bff connection to Sonny.Sonny cherishes the same sort of dreams that animate Jacy & Duane, except that his sharp mind makes him too observant of what's in front of him to be as completely enchanted (and distracted) as the other two. This openness to immediate reality over celluloid dreams delivers him into a real life love relationship with Ruth Popper, a good & vital woman who outperforms Jacy in every important category of womanhood.Picture Jacy & Duane facing the prospect of an unfashionable lover more than twenty years their senior. Neither would consider saying yes because the reality is too far removed from what they've seen on screen.

Everyone walks around in a bit of a stupor, emotionally stunted and not really connecting with each other. It is slow and boring, and I never developed any emotional connection with any of the characters. I simply did not care what happened to them. Everyone gets their moment when they speechify to a (usually younger) character about life, love and the meaning of the universe. I really hate that kind of \"set-speech\" moment. It's like a glaring spotlight on the character, that is unnatural and annoying. Then again, I didn't like \"Diner\" either. The cinematography is nice, but beyond that I find the laudatory praise for this film baffling.",

The cast are excellent, especially Timothy Bottoms as the sad eyed Sonny and Cloris Leachman as the coach's wife. The cinematography is also amazing and the black and white images really add to the tone, becoming almost a character in themselves. Bogdanovich was on a roll here and what a shame that after What's up Doc and Paper Moon he entered a slow decline.My favorite scene is when Ben Johnson takes the boys out and reminisces about his past with Ellen Burstyn's character. In some ways this scene is one of the finest in American cinema and is heartbreaking. I envy those who haven't seen it as you have a treat in store.",

            "content": "I have read several of the blogs on this site knocking THE LAST PICTURE SHOW for various reasons, acting, plotting etc., and it is, as all movies, with flaws, but having been born 18 miles south of Archer City in Olney, Young County,where some of the scenes from the movie were filmed, and having grown up in the county seat of Young County, Graham, I have an appreciation for the movie that other people, especially non-Texans might not have. There have been hundreds of movies made about Texas and Texans and some of them have been filmed in Texas with Texas actors and none of them have captured the true feeling and soul of Texas as TLPS was able to do. The story first was based on an excellent book by Larry McMurtry and brought to the screen through the insight of Peter Bogdanovich. McMurtry's book, LONESOME DOVE, is in my opinion, the Great American Novel, but it's transition to the screen is nothing more than a three-star oat-burner. However, TLPS rises above all that, again in my mind, because having come of age just 10 years after the time of this story I knew all the people and incidents played in the movie. Not literally, but figuratively because the country, ranching and oil field people of rural Texas had not changed whether they were in Archer City or Olney or Graham or most anywhere in Texas save the foreign cities of say, Houston, El Paso, Dallas or San Antonio which are basically Third-World mini-countries plopped unfortunately down on Texas soil.I digress, my connection with the story begins with my childhood best friend, Charles Graham, who's grandfather, Charlie Graham, founded the now ghost town of Anarene, just south of Archer City, and according to Charles and his father, Hap Graham, old Charlie Graham named the town after his wife, Anna, and his favorite horse, Reno. The town boomed in the early days of the 20th Century with a train station, hotel, post office and oil refinery. The Grahams owned a large ranch in the vicinity of Anarene that was also established by old Charlie Graham. In the summertime and on spring and fall breaks and when ever we were needed, we cowboyed all over that country.Being teenagers who drank, and with spirits available in Archer County, that is where Charlie and I chased girls. When the movie came out, I could almost see Charles and myself as Duane and Sonny. The scene where they arrive back in town and the night watchman's car is parked in front of the courthouse with the night watchman asleep in the front seat with his feet sticking out the driver's window is authentic. I have seen that myself.Sam the Lion's Poolhall, I played pool in there, and the old men sitting around the corner gas station, I knew them. That is where we had flats on the pickups and horse trailers fixed.The tank where Ben Johnson as Sam the Lion gave his Oscar winning speech was a place where we swam on hot days. I could go on, but it would fill a book. One other mention I would like to make is had I not missed a telephone call, I would have been one of the nude swimmers in the Jacy pool stripping scene and I might have had a more enriching movie career than the middling non-career I had. I have learned in my life that country people be they in Texas, Iowa, Ohio or where ever are real people and not the hicks and rubes as they are so often portrayed in the movies. I will always be proud that TLPS portrayed Texans as people and not as cretins who are nothing but fodder for ridicule.",

Timothy Bottoms's performance was great, even though he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. I found his character always redeeming himself, truly a panorama of human emotion-much like the movie itself. Duane was also like-able, but much more small town than Sonny.Cloris Leachman's performance was beautiful, just tragic, and credible.

There's very little in the way of plot in this slice-of-life drama about the desperate people in a desolate north Texas town, but Bogdanovich managed to create vivid character sketches through painfully attuned dialogue (co-written with the book's author, Larry McMurtry) and superb casting. Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd, both impossibly young here, made vivid first impressions, though the story revolves mostly around Timothy Bottoms's morally vacant character.

If you read the novel, almost every piece of dialogue and direction is included. There are only two noticeable additions or deletions. Of course, some will say that any film based upon a novel will owe much to the writer, but, in this case, it is so much. I am not knocking Bogdanovitch, although his very modest record since making T.L.P.S. might lead one to think that he got lucky with it. He was lucky but didn't seem to know it and this led to an inflated belief in his own genius and a string of flops. The film is a classic and it is somewhat irrelevant who is chiefly responsible for its success. Film making is a collaborative art form and sometimes it simply catches lightning in a bottle - \"Picture Show\" certainly does that. But you can't work magic from nothing. In my opinion, McMurtry provided Bogdanovitch with as much as any director might need in creating an American cinema classic.",

            "content": "The Last Picture Show (1971)This is a miracle of a little big film. It's small in the details, it plays hard with nuance to the point of losing any sense of plot, and ends up creating better than almost any film of this type, a place and time, the whole mise-en-scene. Director Peter Bogdanovich, often now seen as a film commentator on DVD extras, is a real film devotee, a scholar but also an insider with a feel for \"the movies.\" And he has made several remarkable films, some of which do nothing for me, like \"At Long Last Love,\" and at least one other masterpiece, also in black and white, \"Paper Moon.\" At his best his films are both penetrating and oddly weightless, in the sense that they keep you floating through an imagined world without apparent effort. They are virtuosic without seeming virtuosic.You'll never doubt anyone here, their motives, their inner viability. And you won't question that this place exists, this small, wide street town with almost no one left, a true ghost town in the making. The cast is made of known but not famous actors, and as you watch you appreciate how beautifully, and with what fluidity, they are pulled together. The cameraman is Robert Surtees, a veteran from the 1940s and 50s, and who had recently pulled off the astonishing photography in \"The Graduate.\" You can feel the influence of all of Bogdanovich's film-loving, film-going days, and his deep friendship with Orson Welles. Most of all, \"The Last Picture Show\" feels relevant. It's a metaphor about finding meaning amidst futility, about the escape from troubles and confronting them, about superficial beauty and the real thing, about sex in a way that seems appropriate for the period (the early 1950s), and about community in the that Spoon River Anthology kind of interwoven way. Remarkable on every score.Does all this make for a compelling experience? Do we normally want to sit and watch life go by and a parade of different characters, none of them heroic, none of them criminal, none of them especially singular in a cinematic way? Maybe. It depends if you're the type to take the window seat in a diner, or a bench in the park, or the corner of a busy room, and people watch. You can't participate, but you can pay attention.

Larry McMurtry is a genius at taking stuff that would be unspeakably horrible if it weren't so funny, and then making it really funny. Peter Bogdanovich focuses more on the sadness than the laughter, but he also gets a glowing sensuality from Cybill Shepherd (as Jacy) and a warmth and humanity from Ben Johnson (as Sam the Lion) that are only hinted at in the book. One obvious issue no one else has mentioned is the irony that this book (and film) appeared long before the LONESOME DOVE mini-series, yet it deals with the Texas that rangers Call and McRae sacrificed so much to create. One of the themes of LONESEOME DOVE is Gus asking plaintively, \"was it worth it?\"And of course, the answer is contained in this film. Because these characters are living such stunted, joyless lives that it seems very hard to believe that the buffalo, the Comanche, and the Mexicans all had to be sacrificed to make way for the town of Thalia. And more than that, you feel that somewhere Buffalo Hump and Kicking Wolf are actually laughing at these people. And that if a war party of ghost Comanche could come back and destroy the whole town it would be more of a mercy killing than anything else. And none of that makes the book itself any less poignant. Just the opposite, in fact.",

Featuring the entangled lives and loves of a bunch of teenagers as they come of age, it was one of the first American films to examine the complexity of life in a small town without painting it in shades of a Norman Rockwell white picket fence utopia. The town, once a part of the stable old west is slowly slipping into a new age, and the last picture show of the title represents the end of an era when the town's picture theatre closes down and its former patrons venture off into a life of uncertainty.The film is slow but evenly paced, featuring a strong cast of unknowns, fledglings and established veterans. Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges are Sonny and Dwayne, two boys who enjoy an elevated status in the town due to their positions on the high school football team. Cybil Shepherd plays a manipulative female who strives for amusement by playing all the boys in the town off each other. Cloris Leachman \u0096 who won an Oscar \u0096 gives a sterling performance as the neglected middle aged house wife of the basketball coach, who indulges in an affair with Sonny out of boredom and frustration. The character of Sam the Lion played by Ben Johnson (who also won an Oscar) represents the spirit of traditional western values. His death in the film symbolises the end of an era and the passing of a way of life.\nIn the true spirit of 70s film making, this film was mature, truthful and innovative, while at the same time it harboured a deep respect for the tradition of American cinema that preceded it. This film is a eulogy to the American Western that pays homage to John Ford's similarly styled \u0091The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence'. It examines a world that is caught in turmoil, where the defining values that once guided the people are disappearing and a lost generation is emerging. Bogdanovich and many of the cast members struck career peaks in this film, but sadly many of them were never to recapture that form again.",

Its influence on more recent movies, such as American Beauty and Ghost World, is quite obvious. It's ahead off its time, because it is brave enough to criticize society and to show us the lives of a group of people, just as they are, without sugar-coating them and not being afraid of making them sometimes unlikeable, just the way people are. The screenplay is very good. The characters are realistic and well written, and their attitudes and actions are always where they should be. The pace is just right; it's a slow movie, but always entertaining and thought provoking. The dialogs are great, and they always have double meaning, so you really have to be focused on them to get to the core of their meaning. The fact that the characters go to the movies and that's really important makes this beautiful for any movie buff. Besides, the end of the picture show, is, too, the end of an era, the death of a town.The acting is truly amazing, by just everyone. A look, a movement, the accents, the timing and delivery are just brilliant. all the actors were perfectly cast. Timothy Bottoms underplays a sensitive, shy character, but it works and makes the movie and his character not over the top. You can feel his pain, but in a subtle, still intense, way. Jeff Bridges makes an unlikeable character have a certain grace and you can root for him. He has a good timing and his feelings are real. Cybbil Shepherd has the most amazing body language you can get. She's seductive, sweet, mean, and most of all confused, and you can see all this just by looking at her. It's a complex character, and Shepherd has just the right look and freshness for the part. You can understand her character, even if you don't particularly like her. Cloris Leachman is incredibly expressive; her character is depressed and unhappy, and she's the nicest person. She's just so eager to be loved, and her movements show it all. Ellen Burstyn is very good, her character's in a point of her life in which she's stuck, without knowing how. Ben Johnson has some good delivery and you root for his character, but it's not that great.The direction is simple, focusing on the actors, but still brilliant. The ending, so full of meaning, Cybill Shepherd shots, the large shots, languid and beautiful, the close shots, emotional and touching and the use of light and dark. The black and white makes this nostalgic and beautiful. Overall, really impressive; ahead of its time, tackling important issues and technically impressive. It's a true classic.",

From the screen time we are supposed to be more interested in the young rather than the old - which is the first of its flaws.It effects more than most by being ringing true and featuring a cast of likable - but as history has proved - dramatically limited newcomers. In this small world sex seems to play an extended role and is too much of a feature. Indeed I found myself asking \"what do these people really want besides sex?\"Shepherd plays the town high school talent with a reasonable amount of gusto, but her part relies on her looks rather than her acting. While not an actress (characters are beyond her), she is always a pleasing personality on screen. An ex beauty queen that doesn't take herself too seriously.There is no real need for the nudity and besides, it cuts across the values of the times. Have you ever met a teenage girl who would take their clothes off in front of children (the staring boy doesn't even have pubic hair!) on a diving board? This is the 1950's for Christ sake!(One of the lesser support actresses is shown fully in the buff (point for period pubes!) and the lingering camera shows the Peter Bogdanovich could have directed Porky's in another life!)Hard to knock director, writer and performers for a success story and a film rightly getting over 8 on the IMDb ratings; but we are living in the land of small talents getting lucky. PB went on to make Paper Moon which builds on from what he learns here - but to call his career patching would be generous. Even returning to today's characters in the sequel Texasville - a really wretched film that tries to cover its piffling nature by claiming to be a comedy!There isn't enough lines or character development to know anyone all that well; especially the older cast member. Randy Quaid is hardly given any lines at all - presumably his hangdog face tells us all we need to know about him. Timmy Bottom (what a show biz name!) seems to be acting the role of the visiting poet and I have no idea what his intelligence level is. However he does set the downbeat tone.(I don't think the author does either - in the film sequel (set in 1985) he reappears as a wide-eyed cloud staring moron!)This film deserves its place in the IMDb all-time charts and I doubt time will drag it down.

            "content": "\"The Last Picture Show\" is a coming of age story set in Texas in the early 50's. It deals with sexuality in a frank manner with much of the plot revolving around the romantic entanglements of the main characters.The acting is excellent, with four cast members receiving Oscar nominations in supporting roles (Jeff Bridges, Ellen Burstyn, Ben Johnson & Cloris Leachman). Johnson & Leachman both won and in my opinion Leachman's performance in particular was nothing short of awe-inspiring. I also feel that Timothy Bottoms was worthy of a nomination.Peter Bogdanovich's direction is well-handled throughout but it's the subtle touches that impress me the most. For instance, shooting in black & white was an inspired choice. Also, several times I was struck by the way that he focused on body language rather than dialogue to convey a character's emotions. Additionally, the authentic country & pop soundtrack (rather than a score) really adds to the atmosphere.In the end, what we have is an admirably directed, impressively acted film with a story that will captivate you for two hours and haunt your thoughts long after the screen has faded to black. Do not miss this film.",

            "content": "Scott Greenan New American Cinema February 24, 2006 The Last Picture ShowSet in a more traditional black and white coloring, The Last Picture Show became representative of the death of youth. It represented the end of Hollywood and thus imagination and youth itself. The setting takes place in a town where everything is dead. The streets are empty and the sound of wind permeates everything. The teenagers of this town are a nostalgic representation of the 1950's, as if Leave it to Beaver met the Great Depression. From drive-thrus to diners, Chuck Taylor high tops to Dr. Pepper, this film touched upon some of the key elements of being young in this time. These elements can be fully encompassed by the Royal Cinema. With its demise, the youth culture of the town was chased away.Similar to movies in the 60's, The Last Picture Show has an element of escapism. This is evident in almost all of the young characters. Jacey goes off to college, Duane joins the army, and Sonny attempts to leave, only to turn around once again. His earlier attempts at eloping were foiled as well, bringing him back to his home town. These characters were not like the youth in the 60's in different ways. First and foremost, the film was set back in the 50's. Secondly, the movie was made in '71; these children seemed to be too young to be fully engrossed in the counterculture of the previous decade, which was now dying out as evidenced in other films such as Easy Rider. These characters also seemed to have a work ethic; from oil machinists to the mentally handicapped sweeper, these boys knew hard labor even though their town was in the slums. What was most interesting was the representation of adults in this film. With the exception of Sam, the adults seemed to act like children themselves, cheating on one another's spouses as if it meant nothing. What was worse was that everyone knew of these affairs, even their own children. Such was the case with Jacey and her mother. The blatant denial of responsibilities led to the sexual rebellion of the children. Not once in the movie was there a positive sexual experience that didn't involve anger, tears, or the occasional erectile dysfunction. What was most impressive about the movie was that it all stemmed back to the cinema. The cinema was last form of entertainment in the town and it, too, was going out of business. It was the popular spot for young lovers, a theme that is generated throughout history. The last picture show, itself, was a western classic with John Wayne, a truly American symbol. It brought two warring friends together in the end. The effect of Hollywood was the ultimate form of visual escapism that real Americans experienced. The Last Picture Show represented the changing climate in the youth culture of the day and issued in a new decade of cinema.",

He would go on to make only two other films of any note, Paper Moon in '73 and Mask in '85. Veteran cinematographer Robert Surtees brought a lot of experience and talent to Picture Show. He had done cinematography for many big films in his career including The Graduate, The Summer of 42, Ben Hur, Quo Vadis, Oklahoma, Doctor Doolittle, King Soloman's Mines and many more. Bogdanovich uses his cinematography wisely in this production and he also did a fine job directing this large ensemble cast including veterans and newcomers in Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, Clu Gulagar, Eileen Brennan, Jeff Bridge, Cybil shepherd, Timothy Bottoms and Randy Quaid. An astounding four actors from this film received Academy Award Nominations in Ben Johnson and Jeff Bridges for Best Supporting Actor and Cloris Leachman and Ellen Burstyn for Best Supporting Actress. Johnson and Leachman both won in their only nominations and wins in their careers of an Oscar. This film also received nominations for Picture, Director, Cinematography, and Screenplay. Based on the novel by Larry McMurty and adapted for screen by McMurty and Bogdanovich this is a great coming of age story while paying tribute to small town Americana of days gone by. Great music from the late 40's early 50's era and a great look to this film with fine acting and an interesting story shot in black and white I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 and recommend it.",

Yes, it is a well written, well acted and a beautifully shot film, but I still don't know why this film found such a deep niche in my mind? I wasn't from a small Texas town, in fact I have only lived in big cities. I wasn't born in the 1940s or 1950s, but in the 1970s. And I sure as heck never went through what Tim Bottoms or Jeff Bridges characters did. Yet this movie has struck a cord in my heart and I think it is one that any fan of \"New Hollywood\" should see because it works as almost a precurser to the fall of that group of directors.The film itself looks so wonderful in an airy black and white feel that sweeps over you like a gust of wind in the dry Texas heat. The young characters (Bottoms, Bridges, Sheppard, Quaid) are so wide-eyed and dopey, that it's like they aren't acting. And the older characters (Johnson, Leachman, Burstyn) are so bitter and jaded that you resent them for getting old and letting the world beat them. There isn't a false moment in the film. The last few moments of the film are so gut wrenching and pained that it was a wonder that the sequel (\"Texasville\") was so light-hearted and weak.There isn't much fanfare for this film outside of movie buffs and Bogdanovich fans, which really amazes me because I think it was the high water maker of the decade (peaked too soon, I suppose) and of Bogdanovich's career. It wasn't even released on video until a few months ago. But that shouldn't stop anyone from renting it because it is a wonderful film.",

The timeless isolation of the American West has rarely been more vivid: that sense of lonely, desperate lives caught in a limbo of suspended decay, victims of terminal boredom and frustrated libidos. Sometimes it seems as if the only action in town is motivated by raging hormones, but the more each character yearns after gratification the more they find only heartache and pain.The screenplay (co-written by Larry McMurtry from his own novel) is relentlessly downbeat, and made to seem even darker by director Peter Bogdanovich's inspired decision to shoot the film in black and white (something almost unheard of in American movies at the time). The often stark photography by ace cinematographer Bruce Surtees removes all the joy and artifice from the setting, leaving only a bittersweet feeling of alienation and loss.",

            "content": "Is this really the best film ever made?  In an artistic sense, does it advance the language of cinema?  Well, perhaps not as much as some other films have, but it did have a style of its own.  Some of the shots are simply marvelous, truly expressive without resorting to hammer and tongs. And the cinematography matches the subject beautifully.  While it's not Citizen Kane or Breathless, it certainly makes a contribution far above and beyond the call.What makes this movie great is its story--rarely has narrative film achieved such grandeur on a scale that is so small.  The Bicycle Thief is an apt comparison as far as squeezing so much story out of so little material. What could be so interesting about a bunch of hicks in a dusty, backwards Texas dot-on-the-map?  And yet the story is immense.  Comedy, tragedy, romance, desperation, treachery, love, death, infidelity, ennui, abandonment--it's all there, and portrayed with the loving caress absent in so much narrative film.Now, the power of the narrative certainly exists in the novel, but the actors and the director take the story to heart and lift it above mere words and into the sublime.  Everyone is note-for-note perfect in their acting. Everyone!  But Cloris Leachman--I don't know that I've ever been more blown away by a performance than by what Cloris Leachman achieves here.  I have no words that would do her justice--it's not even worth trying.  I guess all I can say is that repeated viewings have not dimmed the power of what she creates.  She still rocks me back on my heels.The art, the story, the apex standard of performance--it all comes together in this film.  Other movies may outclass The Last Picture Show in one area or another, but I haven't seen one that combines these elements with such gentle, overwhelming power.  I'm not absolutely convinced, but until I'm show otherwise, I have to consider The Last Picture Show as the best of what cinema has to offer.",

Peter Bogdanovich's character study of the different citizens of a small red-neck town in Texas is still a cinematic delight with solid writing and amazing performances. Timothy Bottoms gives his very best performance as the film's main character, while Ellen Burstyn, Jeff Bridges, Eileen Brennen, and a very young Randy Quaid are spectacular.

I'd scarcely even heard of it, so I enthusiastically looked forward to seeing this alleged masterpiece.I was only four years old when this movie was released, and I suspect 1971 America found it to be completely shocking, provocative, artistic, and groundbreaking upon its release. Fifty years later, however, it merits a resounding \"meh.\"It is a very dark tale, conveying the ennui and misery of small-town (very small town) Texas in the early 1950s. Everything is sex, sex, sex, and none of it good. The lead character has a sordid affair with a coach's forty-year-old mentally ill wife. An intellectually disabled teenager is forced into a pitiful encounter with an obese prostitute. A ravishing Cybil Sheppard seems to devour everything and everyone, and none of it is appealing. A minor character, for no apparent reason, tries to kidnap and molest a toddler. How's that for entertainment?But in the end, because it's so dark and lurid, this is one of those Hollywood sacred cows that will be worshipped for all eternity. It's worth viewing just to see these remarkable actors (Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cloris Leachman, and the stunning Cybil Sheppard among others) as they were 50 years ago, but don't buy into the hype. I'm sure this made heads explode in 1971, but unfortunately, there is nothing special about this movie.",

            "content": "The drama The Last Picture Show is directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starred by Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, and Cybill Shepherd. The film takes place the small town of Anarene, Texas during the 1950s.Sonny Crawford (Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Bridges) live in the small Texas town of Anarene and are typical teenage boys. The film starts during their senior year of high school and both have girlfriends. The boys spend time at the local pool hall or going to the picture show with their girlfriends until Sonny loses his after the two basically got bored with each other. Duane's girlfriend Jacy (Shepherd) is the prettiest girl in town and at the start of the film she is a good girl but her mother (Burstyn) really wants her to break loose of Duane and explore the other men of the town. The film revolves around Sonny, Duane, and Jacy and how they experience sexuality in many ways from many suitors.Larry McMurtry and Peter Bogdanovich wrote one of the most spectacular screenplays of all time for this film. Never have I seen a film flow so brilliantly throughout and it does not have an ordinary structure of a film, it just continues through the characters' experiences. I find that the majority of great screenplays throughout history are character driven rather than plot driven because if you don't know and care about the character why should you care about the plot? The three lead roles in the film were so comprehensively built it was absolutely wonderful. I loved seeing when Sonny and his father had about a ten second conversation, in those ten seconds I was able to understand Sonny's entire family life. The theme of loss of innocence in this film was also absolutely wonderful, the screenplay was just terrific.Peter Bogdanovich's direction matched the brilliance of the screenplay that he co-wrote. There were hundreds of shots in this film that were so simply beautiful and were able to get me inside the characters mind and into a deeper level of the film. The scene with Jacy going to the naked pool party was wonderfully shot and will ironically be remembered. It just showed the curiosity of a young person trying to become an adult. Also I really loved the final scene of the film, but I will go into no detail in order to not spoil it for those who have not seen it. Sadly Bogdanovich has not directed another film as wonderful as this one.Not only did Bogdanovich write and direct a great film, he got two Oscar winning performances from his actors. One is not from Timothy Bottoms, but I thought he gave an amazing performance as an innocent young boy trying to become a man. Some of this best acting would have to be with Cloris Leachman when they are having an affair. His simple expressions are just magnificent in showing his confusion about the world that surrounds him. Jeff Bridges was nominated for an Oscar for playing a simple teenager on the outside but a boy longing for love on the inside. Definitely one of the best performances of his very successful career. Cybill Shepherd's character Jacy was definitely one of the most interesting characters in this film in how she wanted to experience pure lovemaking and bliss, and not end up like her mother. She was absolutely stunning, like the rest of the cast. Ben Johnson won the Oscar for his role as Sam the Lion. The scene in which he showed why he deserved to win was when his son came home with a bloody nose and he told the other boys to leave him alone as a tired old man who was done fighting. That was one of the most effective scenes in the film and will also always remain in my memory. Cloris Leachman won an Oscar as well for her performance as a woman who is depressed with her marriage and has an affair with the young Sonny Crawford. The weakness in her face while performing was just enchanting, everything about her was so real. This film definitely has one of the greatest ensemble performances of all time.The editing by Donn Cambern was spectacularly done, I really liked how the film was in black and white making the simple town even simpler. If this was in color I could not really see myself liking it as much and that is why this decision was extremely well executed. The film flowed seamlessly going from character to character. I was completely engaged the whole entire film and never was the rhythm broken. Many films with multiple stories don't work out well because the editing makes it like a break in the film and that takes you out of the film experience.I really loved the country music that was used throughout the film. It added another layer of simplicity to small town and the black and white appearance. Music is key to making a film flow like the editing and this film did it wonderfully letting the songs express the language of the film.Overall I give this film a 10/10. It is one of the greatest films of all time and is wonderful in every aspect of it. There is nothing I could say that is wrong with this film, I absolutely loved it. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys extremely powerful dramas about the loss of innocence because this is one of the greatest ever. Ever. Go see it right now.",

            "content": "Timothy Bottoms kicked off a successful movie career playing the gifted everyman (Paper Chase, Other Side of the Mountain 2, East of Eden) and it all started with this one. In a small dusty town, where the old movie house is the cornerstone in a town with not much to do, three high schoolers come of age. His affair with coach's lonely, bored wife Cloris Leachman brings back memories of The Graduate, except she doesn't hide her loneliness and sadness the way Mrs. Robinson so deftly pulled off. Once Bottoms throws her over for a cute young thing, the repercussions are devastating. Cybill Shepherd, as the insecure sexpot Jacy, radiates the freshness, excitement and emotions that I detected from Kate Hudson in the recent Almost Famous. Ellen Barkin steals all her scenes as Jacy's mom, and Ben Johnson as Sam the Lion is unforgettable. Jeff Bridges also is excellent as football hero Duane. The dusty, destitute Texas scenery filmed entirely in black and white mirrors the destitution and barrenness in the lives of the townsfolk. A true classic, except for the scene where Randy Quaid strips (don't ask). A must-see!",

            "content": "Just after watching \"The Last Picture Show\" I must say I'm clearly impressed it's now a top classic on my film list, as just not one of the best of the 70's but one of the best of all time. The film is really a winner for it's realism and truthfulness that has occurred with so many small towns in America I for one know because being from a small town saw the changes of how things drift from people moving away to the old timers passing away and seeing how love relationships come and go. Many may say this film is not their style as they feel put off for it being set in a small town, and many feel the film is controversial as they think it in ways was a sexual exploration film. And true in many ways for 1971 director Peter Bogdanovich did push the envelope with many of the scenes by showing frontal skin nudity. Still so much more can be taken and learned from this acclaimed social drama that's direct and outspoken.The time and place is 1951 in the small town of Anarene, Texas and this film was adapted from a screenplay by author Larry McMurtry(who's the king of Texas literary stories that get made into hit films, ex:\"Brokeback Mountain\" and \"Terms of Endearment\"). As in many ways aside from this being a film of social change it's a good film of character study as the film focuses mainly on the towns youth. And as you see in many of the scenes from the old country store, to high school athletic games, and parties this reminds anyone who grew up in a small town just what it was like as they see so clearly in the scenes. The most bittersweet themes touched upon in the film are the times we most remember of peer pressure the way it related to love. As the films take on sex from having sex the first time to one night stands and having an affair with an older woman was displayed in such a blunt frank manner. As all of us dealt with those issues growing up being in a small town as most of it was discovered for escapism. Most important this social classic teaches us that nothing last forever in a small town still memories will last forever.The cast is star struck and talented with good turns from Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms and veterans Cloris Leachman, Ben Johnson, and Ellen Burstyn give good supporting performances. The most notable standout was the introduction of the stunning and smooth beauty Cybill Shepherd as her scenes of skin are very memorable and her character as the all American girl can have any viewer think back to a girl of that kind that they knew in high school. Overall the \"Last Picture Show\" in my opinion is a film that's a treasured classic for it's realism that in ways was ahead of it's time as anyone knows being from a small town the drifting changes that takes place among people and the community and escapism is many times the only hope. Mainly the escape is found thru memories and love with friendship yet this film took the theme of sex and used it as an escape tool for small town America which really pushed the envelope the way it showed it in 1971 still that was one element that made this an unforgettable classic gem.",

People move on and people die of course, but maybe saddest of all, people selfishly use each other, and we see that in so many ways here. Even the moments of connecting in sex are far from what we imagine in fantasies; instead there's a lot of bungling and fumbling. It's all very forlorn and sad, even with the strain of friendship running through it.

            "content": "***SPOILERS*** \"The Last Picture Show\" is Peter Bogdanovich's black & white bittersweet classic of life in the little town of Anarene Texas circa 1951. The film involves a number of people in Anarene who's lives are intermingled with each other centering around the only movie theater run by the big man in town Sam the Lion or better yet Lion hearted, Ben Johnson.At first sight Ben doesn't look like nothing much in his ah shucks folksy and almost country bumpkin like demeanor but don't let his looks confuse or fool you. As we soon find out Ol' Sam the Man is the kind of guy whom women just can't get enough of with him having had affairs with almost every female, young old blond tall dark & small, in town! Now in his twilight years Sam's still going as strong as ever even though he's almost out of gas and in danger of breaking down if he keeps on pushing his luck. It may well have been Sam's extra curricular activities, in and out of the bedroom, that leads to his sudden death of a massive stroke & heart-attack halfway through the movie. There's also the hot as a firecracker Lois Farrow, Ellen Burstyn, who's or was, until he found someone better, one of Sam's many lovers from way back when she was barley out of her teens. Now middle age but still very attractive Lois has been cheating on her husband the richest man in Anarene Gene Farrow, Robert Glenn, in getting it on with one of his employees on his oil rig the town stud, that's after Sam the Lion, Abilane, Clu Guager. The hottest member of the cast is the blond pretty and still a virgin, but not for long, Jacy Farrow played by Cybill Shephard in her debut film role. Jacy who unlike her free living and swinging mom Lois tries to keep her virginity intact until her wedding night but with the horny crowd of males in town that's, as it soon turned out, almost next to impossible. It's the handsomest and most popular guy in town Duane Jackson, Jeff Bridges, who first catches Jacy's eye but when the two got down to business in a local motel room Daune in coming up short,by not quite measuring up for the task at hand, proved that he wasn't the stud that Jacy thought he at first was. Feeling both hurt and disappointed,you can just imagine how Duane felt, Jacy dumped Duane like a sack of horse manure over a Nebraskan cornfield. Duane did in fact redeemed himself later when he got a second chance with Jacy but by then she now having experienced sex was looking for someone better and more on the ball. In no time at all, in her wanting to make up lost time, Jacy cast her eyes on Duane's good friend the very introverted, with girls, Sonny Crawford, Timothy Bottoms. Sonny's a man of few words and even fewer sexual experiences; All this sex going on around in town just bored the living hell out of him . That all lead to a fireworks display or explosion with Sonny getting his head based in with a beer bottle when Duane found out that his best friend who always liked to keep to himself was in fact fooling around with his girl Jacy.There's also in the film middle age lonely and ignored, by her high school macho football coach husband Bill Truman, Ruth Popper, Cloris Leachman, who gets the very confused, in what he's supposed to be doing in the movie, Sonny Crawford to start up a hot and heavy affair with her that builds up Sonny's confidence in making it with the opposite sex. But the on and off affair soon turns out to be a total disaster for Ruth in Sonny treating her like a sex toy instead as an equal partner in and out of bed.The film goes on and on with everyones hang ups in town brought out in the open until Duane in him trying to get away from it all, the craziness going on in Anarene, joins or is drafted into the US Army and then slated to be shipped off to fight the dirty rotten Commies in Korea. ***SPOILERS**** In a touching farewell scene between Duane and Sonny,now back as the best of friends, with Duane handing Sonny over the keys to his band new Mercury tragedy strikes again with Sonny's kid brother the mute and mentally challenged Billy, Sam Bottom's, getting hit and killed by a cattle truck as he was sweeping up the town's garbage! The movie ends more or less like it began minus Ben, who's dead, Jacy, who went to collage in Kansas, and Duane, who shipped off to Korea to fight the Commies, with only Sonny left to pick up the ball and keep the show going. But by then there's almost no one left in town for him to play with.",

            "content": "A film that came out in the early 1970's, Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show is a far different movie than the other films we have studied in this course. It is a film set in a different time period, but instead of being a time of excitement, it is a time of confusion between the Second World War and the Korean War. Bogdanovich shows us the small town of Anarene in Texas, and in particular the fragile lives of some of the younger people who live there. It is true that this movie contains no big car chases, no murders, and no truly exciting scenes. However, through the realistic portrayal of these mundane lives by the director and cast, the viewer can see how awkward things can be in a small American town during a time in history that has been disregarded.The film mainly focuses on the character of Sonny, and his interactions with the characters of Duane, Jacy, Sam the Lion and Ruth. All of these characters help us to realize what life is like in a small town, and what it is like to be unsure of one's future. Right away we can get a glimpse of a typical night for these teenagers, as Sonny meets his girlfriend at the picture show, where most people his age go on weekend nights. Sonny, who has been \"going steady\" with this girl for a year, forgets their anniversary, and then, after getting rejected in the front seat of his car, breaks up with her. This is our first sign that Sonny is tired of the typical life he leads and is interested in a change.Then, Sonny is given a new opportunity for change, as the wife of his football coach, Ruth, throws herself at him. They begin to have an affair that lasts for some time, and it appears as if Sonny has realized that the future he wants is with Ruth in Anarene. As their affair continues, Sonny's best friend Duane gets dumped by his long time girlfriend Jacy. His world is turned upside down by this, as he believed that Jacy was his future. Jacy is changed as she begins to look for a new future husband, and considering the possibility of going to college to get away from her small town life.As all this is going on, Sonny's mentor and friend Sam the Lion passes away while he and Duane are in Mexico for the weekend. Sam leaves Sonny his old pool hall in his will, and suddenly, Sonny's future seems totally mapped out. He'll stay in town, work at the pool hall, continue his affair with Ruth, and look after Sam's son Billy. However, Jacy, still looking for her future husband, moves Sonny's interests away from Ruth toward her.In the end, Sonny and Duane have a fight over Jacy, and ultimately make up before Duane is shipped out to Korea. Jacy goes off to college in Dallas, and Sonny goes back to Ruth, realizing that he is going to be living in Anarene the rest of his life, and he has to get to used to his mundane life. The film ends in confusion.In general, the Last Picture Show is a film that is difficult to look at in sections. The best way to understand and realize the greatness of this film is to take it as a whole, and look at the film for what it shows. Despite being set in a small town, during a forgotten time, the people who live there are real people, with real emotions and real hearts, and their lives, although not as exciting as others, can still be moving and empowering.",

Nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, the film is a gritty character study focusing on seven or so lead characters trying to find their true selves amongst the rigidity of the pretend idealism that ran rampant in the 1950s. Filmed in grainy back-and-white, with intentionally harsh contrast, Bogdanovitch never romanticizes nor judges his subjects. He simply allows views to enter their world, and share the pain, enjoyment, and frustration that they experience.The entire ensemble is terrific, especially supporting actor Oscar winners Cloris Leachman as the lonely wife of the homosexual high school basketball coach and Ben Johnson as the town patriarch known as \"Sam the lion.\" Academy Award nominations were also deservedly handed out to Jeff Bridges and Ellen Burstyn (both of turn in some of the best work of their highly-acclaimed careers), and the non-nominated actors Cybill Shepherd, Eileen Brennan, and especially the heart-breaking Timothy Bottoms are also no less than brilliant. The entire cast, both major and minor players, weave their craft flawlessly in this searing motion picture that deftly exposes the tangle of hypocrisies, fear, and bitterness that often underlie extreme conservatism.

Larry McMurtry's original book with the same title was destined to become this film. And it makes sense it would be shot in black and white to provide the depth of the characters and town, coupled with Bogdanovich's close ties to John Ford and Orson Wells, masters of black and white film.\nThe isolated charm of Archer City is shattered by the main characters' desires you feel in your gut. Dwayne's desire to go steady with Jaycee is overshadowed by Jaycee's path to explore her sexuality with a variety of partners and not just Dwayne, who either has no clue or will not admit the truth. As a result, Dwayne's loneliness is as desolate as the town. In a moment of frustration, Dwayne and Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) escape to Texas for the weekend and tell Sam the Lion with no shame (played by Ben Johnson, who said \"I can't do this picture Peter, there's too many damn lines\" and won the Oscar for his performance in this film). Here there is a pivotal moment of silence between these three characters, which portends Dwayne and Sonny's return to the silent deserted town that will now never be the same and mirrors the new hole in their lives. Sam the Lion has a big heart and protects those who need extra care. I fell in love with Johnson and his character, and as a screenwriter, strive to write characters as complex Sam.\nJeff Bridges plays Dwayne and Cybill Shepherd is Jaycee. Shepherd has a few nude-scenes she does alone with the extras edited in later, according to Bogdanovich and TCM's Ben Mankiewicz in The Plot Thickens podcast. The pool scene serves to bring a cast of characters together to escape the monotony of their deserted lives and life in the desert. Another character worth mentioning is Ruth Popper, played by Cloris Leachman who also won the Oscar for this film. Ruth has a guilt-free love affair with Sonny, who is a generation younger than her when her coach \"significant other\" pays little to no attention to her. The relationship between Ruth and her husband is as bleak as the town and the squeaky door to the pool hall, with an underlying reason subtly suggested, literally left in the dust when movie producers and audiences were forbidden to accept or explore (according to Bogdanovich interviews).\nOther important characters include the lovable baseball-capped Billy (Sam Bottoms, Tim's brother in real life), Jaycee's mother (Ellen Burstyn), and Genevieve the waitress (Eileen Brennan). The main characters, like the desert, have no shame - the zeitgeist of the 1960s. I will not give away the ending but I will say, the desert wins.\n~ by Martha J. Rogus\nJune 27, 2020",

            "content": "I fell in love with this film, like I thought I wouldn't, as having seen Texasville earlier. To put it bluntly, The Last Picture Show is a cinematic, flawless masterpiece, steered by a ensemble of great actors, who come together like one big family as working so well off each other. Even a young Bridges, already showed so much great talent here, as a rebel town kid, Duane, best friends with Bottoms, who is a lighter natured boy. Duane is going out with the hottest girl in this small out of way Texas town (Shepherd) who's never looked hotter as the virginal sweetheart. Her timidity in the skinning dipping scene with a young randy, Randy Quaid, another acting asset as Lester, the town clown, is so cute. Set at the start of the good 'ol seventies, we follow the lives of these late teens, going through the normal changes in their life and passing into manhood, where they're a lot of moments we familiarize with reality. Times are getting tougher, the picture theatre closing down for one thing, where Duane ends going in the army, and an older Cloris Leachman becomes a sort of Mrs Robinson to a young Bottoms, after her husband Sam The Lion (Ben Johnson) passes, which I must say was a turning point. The last goodbye Duane and Sonny gave Sam, before heading down to Mexico before death took hold, made that memory more affecting Johnson's is the most memorable performance, an Oscar richly deserved, where Bridges was still getting started as an actor, as many others. Every actors great, every character leaving a visual impression on ya. The black and white choice for this film, couldn't of cut it more perfectly. The dry arid landscapes, the dusty shots of the town, the cold lake shots, are visually beautiful and memorable, reminding me of my own Northbound towns in the dry Summer heat. None was a more affecting moment than the hit and run of the young dumb sweeper kid, (Sam Bottoms). The friendship between Sonny and him, I really liked. In a mature screenplay, TLPS is just one of those unforgettable films, with unforgettable moments, some amusing, where really what I loved about it, was the characters, steered by such heavyweight performances, which was the real strength that drove this movie.

From the salty small town bartender to the guy who brings his own pool cue to the bar to the men placing bets on the outcome of the high school football game. It presents a great snapshot of a '50's town with one main drag and characters who are on a treadmill to nowhere.A majority of the \"moral decay\" referenced in the film's synopsis deals with people getting naked and particularly with a May-December relationship between a high school boy and his gym teacher's comely wife. The main plot centers on a love triangle between a youthful Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms and the lovely Cybill Shepherd, whose beauty is only slightly diminished by the rottenness of her character.The movie definitely has one of the top 5 deflowering scenes I have ever witnessed. It happens on a pool table with close shots of Shepherd lacing her fingers through two leather latticed pool pockets and kneading at them in the manner of a cat.The soundtrack ladles up a ton of Hank Williams, which is really pleasing, and the final 15 minutes feature some outrageously literary moments that are very fun to watch.",

            "content": "\"The Last Picture Show\" is Peter Bogdonovich's masterpiece about a fictional small and dusty little town of Anarane, Texas centering on the High School graduating class of 1951-52. Filmed in glorious Black and White (at the suggestion of no less than Orson Welles), it chronicles the lives of various townsfolk and their interrelationships with each other.Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) are best friends and members of the school football team that apparently didn't know how to tackle. Duane is dating hottie and town rich girl Jacy Farrow (Cybil Shepherd) the daughter of Lois (Ellen Burstyn) and Gene (Robert Glenn) Farrow, oil rich citizens. Sonny is in envy of his pal. Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) owns the local picture show, pool room and diner. He looks after the simple minded Billy (Sam Bottoms).One day, the football coach (Bill Thurmon) asks sonny to drive his wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman) to an appointment. Unexpectedly, Sonny falls into the arms of the bored housewife and an affair ensues. Jacy meanwhile, accepts an offer from the nerdy Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid) to attend a swimming party where everyone skinny dips. Duane is visibly upset.Later, the 'boys\" including Sonny and Duane decide it's time for young Billy to have his first \"experience\". They set him up with the local \"pillow\" which doesn't work out. When they take him back home, Sam is infuriated and bans the gang from his establishments. Duane, who hid in the back seat of the car is not among the blamed.In a very poignant scene at the local swimming hole, Sam reflects to Sonny on his youth describing his affair 20 years ago with a fair lady who was married. We later learn that that lady was Lois Farrow who chose money over love instead of him. We also learn that Sam once owned the large tract of land around the pond but had lost it over the years.Duane becoming bored with life goes off to work in the oil fields On returning one weekend, he and Sonny go off to Mexico for the weekend. On returning they learn that Sam had died the previous day leaving his pool room to Sonny and the caf\u00e9 to waitress Genevieve (Eileen Brennan). Sonny takes on the task of looking out for Billy. Jacy meanwhile is seduced by local oil rigger Alelene (Clu Gulager) on a pool table. Ashamed , Jacy having lost her rich boyfriend begins to play up to Sonny. Sonny stops seeing Ruth and she becomes despondent.Duane goes off to join the army. On his last night home, he and Sonny go to the last picture show before the little theater closes down for good. Then one day, young Billy is killed in a traffic accident. (\"He was just sweeping\") Sonny having lost Jacy to college goes back to reconcile with Ruth and.........................Excellent performances from the largely unknown juvenile cast particularly Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges. . Cybil Shepherd, who was having an affair with Peter Bogdonovich off screen, makes an impressionable debut. Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman both won best supporting Oscars for their roles. There were several other nominations as well. Ellen Burstyn conveys a sense unhappiness and boredom with her life and Eilenn Brennan the hopeless future of a caf\u00e9 waitress with mounting hospital bills for her husband. Watch for John Hillerman as the high school teacher and future producer Frank Marshall as Tommy Luggan the new quarterback for the new season.Followed by an inferior sequel \"Texasville\" in 1990.",

Peter Bogdanovich created a dramatic masterpiece with this the first of his two (and only two) screen classics; the second was Paper Moon. This multi-Oscar honored picture had characters and interactions which spellbound the audience, and you could hear a pin drop at the capacity Fine Arts theater while this picture played. No talking, no rest room breaks, no way you'd miss a minute of it. Look it up on eBay or at Hollywood Video on VHS, cuz they just do not make pictures of this quality anymore. Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman took the supporting actor Oscars, and nobody ever deserved them more. 10 stars are inadequate to evaluate this movie. Columbia Pictures was the second line studio that set records grabbing off the top Oscars such as Best Picture from the major studios, time and again for decades --- until purchased by Coca Cola and resold to Sony. Both new owners remain clueless on making quality pictures; and eventually made Spiderman, the greatest negative force in movies in 20 years. Sure, I enjoyed Spidy; but in the aftermath the coke sniffers of Hollywood dumbed-down their movies into a steady output of stupid and pointless comic book films. As of 10-26-05 Hollywood has yet to recover and there are no films made for adults. Adults defined as ticket-buyers aged 14 or older.",

It does so with excellent black and white photography (Robert Surtees) and the music of Hank Williams.It is not just average America we see, but a one horse town somewhere in Texas. Nothing special happens in \"The last picture show\" and according to Time magazine the film succeeds in making ennui interesting.Only one person (Sam the Lion played by Ben Johnson) is still trying to organize some kind of social / public life. In this respect he is comparable with George Bailey (James Stewart) in \"It's a wonderful life\" (1946, Frank Capra).After his death boredom supremely reigns. This is indicated among other things by the fact that the question \"Who is doing it with whom?\" is occupying the adult population as much as it is the teenagers (for whom this is a normal phase in their development).Apart from grown up with grown up - and teenager with teenager relations there is also an affair between a grown up and a teenager. This affair plays a remarkable role in the movie. We are accustomed to view the younger person as the victim of such a type of relationship. Not in this film! When the teenager is tempted by the beauty queen of the village, he promptly forgets his grown up lover. In a heartbreaking scene we are witnesses of her desperation. This scene is really top class acting of Cloris Leachman.",

            "content": "There was a boom of up-and-coming directors in 1970s America which included Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Woody Allen trying to make names for themselves. The first to make this impact was Robert Altman in 1970 with his ant-war film, 'M*A*S*H'. But the first masterpiece to be released in the decade was Peter Bogdanovich's second feature film, 'The Last Picture Show'--the film said to be the finest work by a young director since Orson Welles and 'Citizen Kane' thirty years prior.'The Last Picture Show' is a multi-person character study about residents in a dying town from 1951 to 1952. Shot on location, Peter Bogdanovich chose to make the film in black and white (a move he was surprised the production company allowed him to do) because shooting it in colour made many shots look nice and beautiful. The town is decaying and has no reason to exist. A nice look would have taken away from the whole idea of this town being blank. (Despite the drab look, it also succeeds in making it look like a movie from the 1950s since it is in black and white.) Bogdanovich succeeds in making this Texas town seem as blah as can be.The first two characters we are introduced to are Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges)--the co-captains of the high school football team. Duane wants to marry Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) and Sonny's girlfriend dumps him. Sonny then starts to have an affair with the coach's beautiful wife (Cloris Leachman). Getting to know Jacy a bit more, she's a virgin that wants to get sex out of the way as fast as possible. There's even a scene where she accompanies a very young Randy Quaid to a nude pool party. Her mother is played by Ellen Burstyn, who has fallen out of love with her husband and is unfaithful to him. The last of the major character we get to know is the wise Sam \"The Lion\" (Ben Johnson). Sam owns most of the businesses in the town including the movie theatre (called \"The Picture Show\"). Upon his death, he leaves many things to each of the characters we get to know, including the pool hall to Sonny. Each of these characters are in search of bigger and better things in life. They just don't know what these things are or how to achieve them.The two films that I would compare this to are Spike Lee's 'Do The Right Thing' and 'American Pie'. It is like 'American Pie' because of the abundance of sexual content that drives the characters. And it is like Spike Lee's breakout hit because of its ambiguity in its message. 'Do The Right Thing' is obviously about racism, but 'The Last Picture Show' gets people wondering even more. (Peter Bogdanovich agreed to direct this film because he had no idea how he would make it, which is an odd paradoxical approach.) We get that the film is trying to tell us something, but what? My guess is the pursuit of happiness. Each character strives for something greater in the residents of a dead-end town. Regardless of what the overall message is, each character is deeply and honestly fleshed out. Because of this, the movie is fascinating. Why not show simple honesty in people? Character-driven films are always great.None of the characters are perfect. The town is dead. The message is muddled. But what Peter Bogdanovich captures is the essence of emerging adulthood in its finest form.4/4.",

Jacy eventually chooses Duane and Sonny then actually drifts into an affair with the lonely wife of his football coach (Cloris Leachman).Filmed in beautiful black and white, this movie evokes a period feeling and teenage sexual awakenings better than just about any film that came out of the 70's. Bogdanovich pulled rich performances from his cast with Bottoms giving a star-making performance as Sonny, Ben Johnson won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Sam the Lion, the local businessman who pretty much runs the town and Leachman won supporting actress, though, personally, I think that award should have gone to Ellen Burstyn, who is just luminous as Jacy's mother.A beautiful and lovely drama that will entertain and haunt.",

As the people of the town move on to bigger cities or better opportunities, Bogdanovich shows what was left behind: a gas station with missing letters on its sign, people yearning for something more than the town can offer them, an old pool hall, a caf\u00e9 with the \"regulars\" and a movie theatre forced into showing its last picture show as it declines in popularity with the population.Based on the novel, The Last Picture Show imagines life as it must have been at the Royal theatre. While the Western genre was alive, a small town in Texas could thrive, but as soon as that way of life dies out, the town goes with it. Bogdanovich displays this by matching the color schemes with the attitude of the place. The black and white cinematography captures the bleak atmosphere of the film. In the scene of Billy's death, a moment is caught in your mind as Sonny looks over to see tumbleweed floating by in the wind while a crowd of ignorant adults argue over the dead body. However, the true passing away of the Western comes with Sam's death. He was the thread of hope that this town offers something for rising generations, the diner and theatre. His entertainment drew in the teens, and kept them out of trouble. Without him around, the youths are forced to find amusement outside of the town.The slow movement within The Last Picture Show is presented in a true to life manner. Our lives are full of embarrassing, discontinuous episodes. Bogdanovich merely does what Andy Warhol once experimented with, the direction of life as it really appears to us. So while it may be slow moving, it expresses the same concerns that we face daily. How do we know if we will ever find that one person for us? Jacey offers a stereotypical high school girl caught up in the affairs of live and sexuality with confusion as the basis for her thoughts. She does not know what she wants in life, which is similar to the fact that we do not know for sure what we want in life until after we have found it. The affair that Leachman engages in as a 40-year-old further demonstrates the desperation that the people feel who are trapped within their lives with no way out. Ellen Burstyn dejectedly abandons all hope for love when she gave up Sam years ago, and we see the air let out of her life.The cast was outstanding in their performances, but especially Timothy Bottoms who played Sonny. His portrayal of a warm and fun loving adolescent on the verge of adulthood is endearing to his audience. His innocence, even in his guilt of an affair, is forgivable. There is a connection between him and the viewer that allows them to accept whatever he throws at them. All-in all the cast presents a memorable film to be enjoyed from all generations.",

Anyway, it makes a better story if this was a young director's first movie that he knocked out of the park. Even from an initial glance its apparent as to what this film is about, but Bogdanovich doesn't just leave it with a theme in mind, he uses every moment of the film to pursue it and by doing so constantly seems to reveal yet another layer to the film. However, I don't think Bogdanovich's vision would ever have been brought to fruition without the cast. The story lies in the heart of its characters, making them the heart of the story. The picture received two nominations in both the Supporting Actor and Actress categories, prevailing in both. Though snubbed in terms of awards, the finest performance may have come from the film's lead, Timothy Bottoms.If you're willing to commit to The Last Picture Show you'll find that its not seeking to entertain you in the conventional sense(not to say that it's boring which I dont believe it is)but expects you to appreciate it as art.",

(R)Sharply-observed mosaic of individuals living (trapped) in a small North Texas town in the early 50s, some eager to come of age and either get out or cling to tradition, others well past that youthful prime and stung by a paralytic desolation. Director Bogdonavich, who also wrote the brilliant script with Larry McMurtry (author of the novel on which the film is based), correctly chooses black & white for his canvas, not just because it feels so appropriate considering the era and starkness of the location, but because of the Orson Welles/\"Citizen Kane\" influence, where deep focus is much more easily achieved. Not much of a plot, per se (which is kind of the point for these aimless souls); has as much a sense of place as nearly any film before or since, its setting becoming the dominant character in a film full of memorable, deftly-realized figures.

            "content": "Sex in a small town. And more sex. And more sex...In 1951 Anarene, Texas, there's not much to do except be an angst-ridden teen and feel up chicks in the dark of the old movie theater. But small town life is crawling to a close, and the teens in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, like the town of Anarene itself, are thrown into the world with their na\u00efvet\u00e9 on stun and their hormones on kill.The bad economy (isn't it always?) has forced the movie theater to close. Soon there will be a last picture show. And the dull meaningless void beckons. The teens are antsy, drunk, irresponsible; the adults, worn out, cynical, devoid of dreams.From a novel by Larry McMurtry, Peter Bogdanovich co-writes and directs this frank, forward tale of a small community fragmenting as the old guard is replaced with teen beat. With the death of the town's tacit head, Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), the townsfolk and teens who regarded him a stabilizing force are suddenly rudderless.Duane (volatile Jeff Bridges) and Sonny (soulful Timothy Bottoms) are best friends, high school graduates gawping at the threshold of life without a clue. Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) is the teen tease every boy lusts after - she's Duane's girl, but has no qualms in cozying up to a rich college boy to further her prospects.Shepherd plays Jacy with a callousness that prompted the invention of the c-word; using sex academically, as a weapon. She accepts an invitation by Randy Quaid (so young he looks like little brother Dennis) to a pool party only to get closer to the rich boy; on this same night, Duane gives her a watch bought with six months savings, which she callously takes off - along with her clothes - and dives naked into the pool for the rich boy. Rich boy tells her \"Come see me when you're not a virgin,\" so she deflowers herself dutifully with Duane (who adopts the studly strut - until he realizes she was only prepping herself for the richie).Meanwhile, MILF Ruth (Cloris Leachman) cozies up to teen Sonny while her husband Coach Popper is at school coaching Sonny's basketball team. Back when Cloris Leachman was only in her 40s, she was surprisingly svelte and sexy, yet it wasn't from her cardboard emotionlessness or pointy bra - it was her sexual forthrightness, openly seducing Sonny with a frankness that we don't see in modern American cinema.When Jacy eventually elopes with Sonny she doesn't allow him to touch her in the car on the way to their honeymoon; as with all her relations it is purely academic, simply so she wouldn't be an old maid in a small town. When they are caught and she is forced away from him, it is not the usual tearful rending of two lovers; she gives him an ambivalent look, gets into another car and doesn't look back as it drives off.Then - Clu Gulager, renowned C-actor and bane of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000, boyfriend to Jacy's mother (Ellen Burstyn, also looking young and MILF-y), seduces Jacy on a pool table, who acquiesces with nary a movement.No such thing as foreplay in this town, which is a refreshing change from all those mid-Americana teen movies where kids spend endless hours necking necking necking. Yet there is also dearth of emotion. Bogdanovich is intent on showing us how clinical, uncomfortable and embarrassing sex is, almost an unnatural act with its participants autonomously going through motions without knowing why.And on the opposite side of the life-creating act, there is death. Tragedy must necessarily dog a town on the threshold of change. Or does this much shtupping. And Bogdanovich pours out the tragedy in equal amounts.THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is the reality that happens after the cameras stop rolling on any given episode of HAPPY DAYS.",

            "content": "If you have ever lived in a small town or if you grew up in the American heartland in the 1950s, this movie will evoke overwhelming nostalgia. But the story is so powerfully told that I think that for everyone it will evoke nostalgia for a time and place, even for that which they may never have known.The town, as well as the movie, is held together by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) who owns the movie theater, the caf\u00e9, and the pool hall. In fact he owns just about everything there is to do in Anarene, except for watching the hapless Anarene High football team ... and sex. It is no wonder then that sex, in its many faceted varieties, plays a big role in this town, and in this movie.There are so many wonderful and memorable scenes that it would simply require a small volume to recount them. One scene that grabbed me was when Sam and Sonny are at a lake outside of town, ostensibly fishing, and Sam reminiscences about old times, about when he came to the lake twenty years earlier with a lover. Sam makes the comment, \"You wouldn't believe how this land has changed.\" The camera pans the surroundings and it is hard to see how this area could have changed much in the last thousand years, but Sam is clearly attuned to the subtle changes, since memories were impressed on him in a time of strong emotion. We all have clear memories from when and where we have been happy, even if it is a small lake in a desolate flat land. And Sam's specific comment can be taken to apply more generally to the basic theme of the movie. This incredible scene ends with Sam's saying, \"Being a decrepit old bag of bones, that's what's ridiculous,\" and anyone who is not close to tears at that point will never truly appreciate the beauty of this movie.",

            "content": "Peter Bogdanovich's career as a movie-maker has had the misfortune to start brilliantly at a level there was no way he could possibly maintain. The only way was down &, unfortunately, it nose-dived spectacularly. The Last Picture Show & Paper Moon were two of the very best movies of the 70's, especially TLPS. Shot in black & white for dramatic effect it also enables the viewer to really believe it was filmed when it is set, circa 1950, in the small mid-west town of Anarene,Texas. It is a really brilliant character study of a dying community & their interaction. The two principal characters Sonny & Duane (Timothy Bottoms & Jeff Bridges) are on the edge of manhood & do what all late teenage boys do, play football, drink & chase girls.The only other recreations open to them are the local caf\u00e9, pool hall & cinema all owned by Sam (Ben Johnson) a somewhat dour but down-to- earth, honest, & decent man. When he dies & the picture house has to close it is a metaphor for the death of the community. The towns characters are often delineated by the use of Hank Williams country & western music which was contemporary with the films time setting. The local young, treacherous & selfish beauty Jacy (Cybil Shepherd) is dating Duane. \"Cold,Cold Heart\" is played in the background to her introduction. Another Hank Williams song, \"Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used To Do?\", is also used to imply a situation. Jacy's mother Lois is played by Ellen Burstyn. We learn later on in the film after Sam's death that as a young woman she had an affair with Sam & like him she is also a very down-to-earth type. She doesn't think much of the future prospects for the young man Duane her daughter Jacy has in tow & asks her bluntly, \"Have you slept with him\". Jacy tells her mother, \"Oh! Momma it's a sin before marriage isn't it\". Lois tells her, \"Don't be so mealy-mouthed. If you slept with him a couple of times you might find there isn't anything magical about him\". She ends the advice to her daughter by telling her, \"Remember beautiful everything gets tired If you do it often enough & if want to find out about monotony real quick, marry Duane\". Another of the movie's more interesting female characters is Geneveive (Eileen Brennan) who waitresses & runs the cafe owned by Sam. She too is a very down-to-earth, truthful, middle-aged lady with a somewhat world-weary manner. Sonny has an affair with a lonely older married woman Ruth Popper played by Chloris Leachman. Her husband is the local high school football coach but he has little time for his wife & their marriage has gone stale & loveless. Ruth Popper is also basically a good sort & when Sonny, inevitably, fails to show up one day you really do feel for her. Jacy (for her own selfish reasons) wants to lose her virginity & when Duane fails to do the business for her she decides to dump him. She then has a brief dalliance with Duane's best mate Sonny which causes an argument between them leading to Duane punching Sonny & breaking his jaw. Genevieve knows of Duane's violent streak & tells Sonny that he would be best off joining the army, which just before the movie's end he does. Sonny returns to Ruth Popper's house & in a very moving scene she vents her anger & frustration on him but takes him back because her life is so lonely & empty. To fully appreciate TLPS it simply must be seen.",

What makes \"The Last Picture Show\" so memorable is the stellar cast and Bugdanovich's skilled direction. In addition to the stars, Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges, the cast includes Cybill Shepherd (in her first movie), Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn and Eileen Brennan. All the major characters in the film are finely etched, people you really get to know and understand. Shepherd was 21 when \"The Last Picture Show\" was made, as beautiful as the sexy heart-breaker she portrays. She was a star from the first moment she appeared on the screen. Leachman, Burstyn and Brennan were at the height of their powers which were considerable. Bottoms and Bridges, high school buddies and townies, handled their roles convincingly. A lesser known actor, Ben Johnson, played Sam the Lion, owner of the local pool hall, the movie house and the burger joint -- and a very important figure in the film.Forty years later, it is still worth seeing.",

Also, an excellent job was done with the nostalgia effects, and since I entered the first grade in 1952-the year Jo Stafford's song \"You Belong to Me\" was one of the number one hits of the year-I did receive an adequate idea of what the early '50's was like in many ways, so I do think this was a great film from that standpoint.It was appropriate that the movie was filmed in black and white, for it indicated a basic fact about movies of that era: most movies were filmed in black and white, and thus there was a scarcity of movies filmed in color at that time. The story line was simple: a small Texas town is dying, and toward the end two boys go to the last picture playing in the local movie theatre.But where was the plot? There basically was none. Concomitantly, where was the substance? Young people go skinny-dipping and have their big fling at sex. The movie was something of a collage, since too many pieces (brief scenes representing different types of persons, different ideas being represented) were simply thrown together. There was no plot present. Therefore, for the Best Picture of the Year award it hardly qualified.",

            "content": "In The Last Picture Show there is a striking resemblance between Sonny and Sam the Lion. Sonny is headed down the same path of life that Sam lived. When Sam dies and Sonny inherits the pool hall from Sam, he basically turns into Sam. Sam lead a pretty dull and lonesome life mostly because he was trapped in the town, and by giving Sonny the pool hall it causes Sonny to get trapped in the town too because he can't leave the pool hall. He tries to leave after Billy dies, but he can't he is trapped.When Sonny, Sam, and Billy go fishing Sam tells Sonny the story about his affair with Lois Farrow many years ago. He tells Sonny they were wild and they loved each other and it was his true love but it ended because she grew up. He also said that they used to come out to the 'tank' where they were fishing and swim (naked) and be crazy together. Sonny then lives this story out with Lois's daughter Jacy. He has a fling with her and they go out to the 'tank' and get a little crazy and then they decide they are going to get married, but Jacy changes her mind. She purposely leaves her parents a note so that they will find them and stop the marriage. She does this because she has grown up and doesn't want to have the fling anymore so now the affair between Sonny and Jacy is over the same way that Sam and Lois's affair ended. And much like Sam Sonny will probably never find another girl to really be with because the one he really wants got away. The movie begins with the empty town and the wind blowing through to show how really empty it is and then we see Sonny going to the pool hall and Sam is there. Sam has no one except for the kids that come visit him and play pool. He was wild in his day like Sonny because of the story he tells and because when Sonny and Duane go to Mexico you can tell Sam wants to go, but he has grown up and matured. When Sam dies Sonny starts to take his place and live his life. He inherits the pool hall, he takes care of Billy, he has the same affair, but most of all he matures and becomes lonely. Duane goes to Korea to fight and maybe never return, Billy dies, Jacy goes to college, and his affair with Ruth Popper ends. In the end when he goes and visits Ruth she tells him he has finally grown up so that shows he has matured and his wild days are over. He is going to live the same dull lonely life as Sam did. Then the film fades out the same as it started. The camera pans back out of the empty town and this shows that the story is repeating itself because Sonny has taken over Sam's life. Sonny will live to tell the same story that Sam did to a young man someday and he will live the same life as Sam did. The story could start over with Sonny as Sam's part and another young man as Sonny because of the fact that Sonny is living Sam's life. The ending is the same as the beginning.",

            "content": "The Last Picture Show is the treasure chest of breakthrough cinematic style that so many top rank film makers would shamelessly loot in their personal quests for identity. Its sparse, barren ambiance and coincidentally occurring simultaneous story lines can be found nearly equaled in the lighter, frothier George Lucas classic \"American Graffiti\" just two years later in 1973. The setting of a restrictive, if not dying home town is unmistakable. The ingenious technique of incidental music was lifted intact and Lucas, bizarrely, is often credited as its originator. I was amused at the similarities I found in David Lynch's stunningly disturbing first feature, \"Eraserhead.\" Its odd rhythms and anachronistic use of black and white are direct quotes of Bogdanovich's offbeat western. And more recently, speaking of offbeat westerns, PT Anderson's remarkable \"There Will be Blood\" owes more than a casual thanks to Peter. The curiously intimate yet somehow startlingly remote feel of all the relationships in both can not be mere coincidence. And, at the risk of sounding paranoid, or delusional, I even attribute much of Scorsese's towering triumph,\"Raging Bull,\" directly to \"The Last Picture Show's\" gritty realism, natural character speak, and intentionally voyeuristic perspective. Marty merely substitutes extreme violence for Peter's awkward sexuality.And going the other way, TLPS bares its pedigree fairly openly, giving a big nod to such genre defining picts as 1963's \"Hud\", with its bitter disillusioned inhabitants, or 1956's John Wayne revenge classic \"The Searchers.\" That one might be a stretch for some, but I found the iconic desolate imagery of Monument Valley echoed in the feeble but equally iconic profile of ancient, desiccated 1951's Anarene, Texas. It's a man made monument to slim chances and existential futility. This attribution is made sensible when you remember that TLPS's writer, Larry McMurtry, was a huge fan of John Ford, and \"The Searchers\" stands out as a particularly bleak example of his sublime talent.So, if you're fond of tracking lineages and progeny, \"The Last Picture Show\" is a rich vein that can be mined for a couple more generations. It's open, vague narrative style and coolly detached demeanor can serve as worthwhile instructions for so many of today's overly earnest, hyperactive, exceedingly self involved, absurdly myopic movie makers. There's always been a shortage of truly original vision in Hollywood - it gets immediately diluted and corrupted - so paying your respects to the few genuinely fine examples we have is no crime. More people should steal from this extraordinary film, if that's what it takes to achieve anything worth my time.",

            "content": "Based on the novel by Larry McMurtry, The Last Picture Show tells the story of a small mythical town in Texas. Sonny and Duane are two boys that are trying to survive the best they can with what they have been given in life as their world crumbles around them. For them the world is this small town, Anarene, which is trying to adjust to the changing times. There are many images of decay and destruction in this film, as well as a theme of longing for the past.When the movie first opens we see a deserted street with empty storefronts. The wind is howling and dirt is flying everywhere. The buildings appear to be rundown and abandoned but later we learn that this is not entirely the case. There is life behind the walls, struggling to survive. Part of the decay and destruction in this film comes from the colliding of the generations. It seems as though there are two main age groups dealt with, the young adult and the middle aged adult. Sonny seems to have a Mrs. Robinson like complex and sleeps with his basketball coaches wife. An interesting scene that displays this is the first time they have sex. They show both of them in the frame undressing. Sonny is stumbling and pulling of his boots as he throws his jacket carelessly on the nearby chair. Simultaneously Ruth is undressing and hanging up her jackets and shirts. It isn't until she is almost completely undressed that she begins to falter and gets stuck in her slip. She is tearing away layers of her past and giving in to Sonny's youth. Nick is an older man that is a force in the small town. He seems to own and control everything that goes on in the tow. He is the epitome of longing. Nick looks at Sonny and Duane as if he wishes he could be young again and swimming with Lois. He talks about how the town was completely different when he was young and how there were mosquito trees back then. The generations collide as Sonny and Duane head off to Mexico. They are carefree and just want to escape and have a good time. As they pull away they say to Nick, \"Think the town can get along without us till Monday?\" Upon returning they see that the pool hall is closed, and the town is abandoned. Nick has died while they were away and nothing is the same after that moment. Sonny realizes that he can't waste his life anymore.Several times throughout the film we see Billy sweeping. There is also a scene where Nick is using a brush to clean off the pool table. They are both trying to restore things to the way they used to be. Billy's muteness may be the result of many factors, but he is the only neutral character in the movie. He symbolizes both the past and the future. When he dies they seem to collide. The second to last scene also struck me as I was watching it. Sonny has returned to Ruth, seemingly for comfort and out of guilt more then anything else. They are sitting at the table clutching hands, and as the camera fades away there is a gun on the wall pointing towards Sonny's head. It seemed like a very foreboding image as I was watching it, and made me unsure of Sonny's future. He seems to have a good head on his shoulders, unlike many people in the town though. Then the scene fades into an image very much like how it began. The town is desolate once again and the wind is howling through it.",

Yet we sympathize with these bad role models because their misdeeds only result from their missed opportunities. It is a very depressing movie, yet every scene is painfully honest.

Slightly sentimental, slightly \"European,\" this movie about life in small-town Texas in the 1950s has excellent performances. Ellen Burstyn, Jeff Bridges, Cloris Leachman, Ben Johnson are all fine.Unfortunately, the story of Genevieve (an equally fine Eileen Brennan) the waitress, is not tied up. Why doesn't Sonny turn to her after the demise of his friend? And the sequence of the discovery of the body and the moving of the body is somehow awkward. The subsequent sequence of Sonny's attempt to leave town is made to be awkward as well.I don't really think of these criticisms as spoilers, since I have read them elsewhere.In spite of these flaws, the movie is very engaging and mournful. It ends on a hopeful note, which is a relief.The thing that jumped out at me the last time I saw this movie (on DVD) is Cloris Leachman's very vague suggestion that her husband might be homosexual.

I'd seen bits of Picture show, but never watched from the opening shot of the abandoned movie theater to the closing shot of that selfsame theater - I think I avoided mainly just because I find Bogdanovich an insufferable filmmaker other than his first hurrah, Targets (in which he co-starred with Boris Karloff), another film framed by a movie theater (in that case a drive-in).Must admit Picture Show is a fairly brilliant work, and I didn't realize he did it in black and white at a time when 95 percent of new movies were in color. Nice way to pay homage to the fading world it depicted! Having all the music be heard via on screen players (radio, turntable, etc) was a nice touch, as well as a cool way to personalize a sound to fit each character's personality.Bogdanovich may be the most irritating twit in Hollywood (no small feat!), what with the stupid ascot and indoor shades, not to mention getting Playboy Playmate Dorothy Stratton killed by her husband by moving her into the bedroom of his Bogdanomansion, but I must confess he made at least two fantastic films: Targets and this one.",

You had sexual assault of minors, sexual assault of the mentally disabled, sex outside marriage, nudity, and vulgarity.

            "content": "Unusually takes the route of filming its early 50's period piece by using black and white and indeed filming in a style more akin to the 50's.\nThe movie focuses on a dying town in the dust bowl of Texas. Our high school leads therein have nothing to do and little to keep them in this coming of age drama.\nThe film, because of its feel, kinda shocks with its overt sexuality. We are not used to seeing the seedier side of 50's life writ large across our screen. However, it is the sexually frustrated characters of the next generation up that prove most intriguing. There's more depth to Burstyns use of her sexuality as a desirable (albeit married) 40 year old or Leachmans repressed and feared urges of an unhappy and more staid housewife than the bumbling around of horny teenagers. Only Ben Johnson the owner of the local diner, picture house and pool bar can match the female characters depth, as he reminisces about how America has changed and how he has gotten older.\nCybill Shepard radiates any time she's on screen, as manipulative as she is beautiful, she's learned a trick or two from her mother (Burstyn) although still a work in progress.\nJeff Bridges doesn't really convince of the outstanding actor he will become and is outshone by Timothy Bottoms who's more thoughtful character and garners more of my attention.\nThe mundanity is well represented here so much so at times the movie labours. It could have found a better balance between it and the kitchen sink of deaths and affairs. I felt the 50's style of shooting held the movie back and while there was realism, it affected the impact of the events.\nStill the characters themselves are compelling and you will be fascinated by this raw glimpse at anecdotally modern themes in a rarely visited and more vintage world.

But I always felt it could've been accomplished in a more subtle way. The black and white was cool. The editing & pacing for me were the biggest problems here as they felt like they were more short stories being chained together without any continuity. I can appreciate that the message all of these stories were trying to convey was feelings of hopelessness and defeat but it came across as more pretentious and abstract. This made the pacing really suffer as I felt every scene was just trying to drive home the same point and message and it got repetitive by the second half of the film. These short stories never came across as part of a bigger story for me. It was interesting to watch the characters stories at times as some scenes were more interesting than others. I felt sometimes some scenes had no point for the actual plot though and was just confused and frustrated at times.

Anarene itself is a bleak take on the human experience (or almost a purgatory; the town really has little justification for its existence, just persisting despite its seemingly meager nature), where little of substance ever changes apart from death and sex, the focus of most of the characters. Self-reflection only invites a sense of emptiness or longing for what is perceived as lost. It could also be construed as a commentary on the flimsy nature of society and personal relationships; the individuals are impulsive, driven by instinct and passion, and almost animalistic, and there isn't an objectively healthy romance in the script. The lack of color might be an immediate write-off as an artistic try-hard move, but the visual elements absolutely fit with the themes. Performances are fitting and strong across the cast list, including a young Jeff Bridges. (4.5/5)",

Granted, there's more at work here beyond that, it's still impossible to deny that all other elements take a back seat to the overall subtext at work. With this in mind, no single component takes more of a hit than the pacing.

            "content": "This may be one of my favorite films because it focuses on all of the elements I love, a close-knit community with many secrets, teenagers coming of age, older woman-younger man love affairs and disgruntled housewives. Ensemble dramas can be great when done well and this is a prime example as a great cast assembles to portray flawed, complex characters with detailed histories as various conflicts arise in their small town. The cinematography is gorgeous and the direction is subtle but able to capture all of the nuances necessary to make the emotional releases of various characters devastating. I believe that this one of the best films of the 1970s and definitely a film that everybody should watch.\n\nSonny, Timothy Bottoms, and Duane, Jeff Bridges, are high school best friends living in the small town of Anarene, Texas in 1951. They are both in love with the shallow and manipulative Jacy Farrow, Cybill Shepherd, whose mother Lois, Ellen Burstyn, is having an affair with her husband's employee Abilene, Clu Gulager. After the boys treat the autistic Billy, Sam Bottoms, cruelly they are punished by Sam \"the Lion\", Ben Johnson, who plays a large role in the town's affairs and has a tendency to wistfully remember the old days. Sonny begins an affair with Ruth Popper, Cloris Leachman, the wife of the high school football coach. The two boys come of age in this environment and when tragedy befalls the town many shocking secrets come out.\n\nFilms about teenagers have a tendency to be dismissed as immature and lacking in substance but the problems of teenagers as they become adults can serve as a rich source of material for an interesting story. The problems of teenagers, and their parents, are treated seriously here while it is also acknowledged that the decisions the youths make probably won't matter as the war looms. Jacy feels like the most immature of the friends as she throws herself at any man who will have her and uses her sexuality to manipulate the men around her, echoing her mother's actions. She seems unaware of what the future holds for her and makes potentially life changing decisions like getting married on a whim. Of course the male teenagers are also immature but they are less performative in their actions and can be seen to be more emotionally mature than the adults that have raised them.\n\nThe screenplay is good at revealing backstories without feeling strictly expository as the adult characters' pasts are revealed through the subtle hints and implications instead of being told to a character who would already be aware. It also allows for emotional and dramatic moments like Lois' breakdown at Sam's funeral but for the most part these responses feel natural and the dialogue always seems to fit the character it has been assigned to. A significant part of the film is the youths understanding that the adults were also once young and made their own mistakes and had their own problems. I appreciated the recognition of the difficult relationships that adults have with their past selves and the pains that come with watching your children make the same mistakes you once made. All of these unique touches make the film great and although in the hands of wrong actors this film could be terrible the screenplay elevates the quality of the production significantly.\n\nAll of the acting is great in this film, even Cybill Shepherd does good work, however Cloris Leachman deserves singular praise for her stunning performance as Ruth Popper. It would have been so easy for her relationship with Sonny to veer into feeling inappropriate or for Ruth to be seen as a pedophile but Leachman makes Ruth so disarmingly sweet and sympathetic that we can't help but support her in the decisions she makes. The moment at which she finally snaps, the final scene of the film, is earned because Leachman had given such a quiet, restrained performance up until that point and her character's emotional breakdown felt real. \n\nThis would be on my top 100 films if I were ever to compile a list and beyond admiring or respecting it I love it and always enjoy watching it. This is one of those films that I can't understand people not liking.",

            "content": "Produced by Hollywood iconoclast BBS Productions, film critic-turned-director Peter Bogdanovich's 1971 film pays homage to Hollywood's classical age as it chronicles generational rites of passage in Anarene, a fictional one-horse Texas town. In 1951, high school seniors Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges) play football, go to the movies at the Royal Theater, hang out at the pool hall owned by local elder statesman Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), and lust after rich tease Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd in her film debut). As the year passes, Sonny learns about the pitfalls and compromises of adulthood through an affair with his coach's wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman) and a thwarted elopement with Jacy after she dumps Duane. Following two tragic deaths, and with Duane gone to Korea and Jacy packed off to college in Dallas, Sonny is left behind in Anarene, wise enough to absorb the life lessons of Sam the Lion and Jacy's mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn). He is determined to honor Sam's legacy as the town's conscience, despite a telling sign of incipient communal disintegration: the closing of the Royal Theater after a final showing of Howard Hawks's Red River. Paying tribute to classical Hollywood directors like Hawks and John Ford, Bogdanovich used old-time cinematographer Robert Surtees and shot The Last Picture Show in crisp black-and-white, with a restrained style devoid of the kind of \"new wave\" techniques (jump cuts, zooms, and jittery hand-held camerawork) used by such contemporaries as Arthur Penn, Robert Altman, Mike Nichols, and Martin Scorsese. As in such Ford films as The Grapes of Wrath (1940), Bogdanovich relies on careful visual composition in deep focus to help communicate the regret over the passing of an era. Hailed as one of the best films by a young director since Citizen Kane (1941), The Last Picture Show premiered at the New York Film Festival and went on to become a hit. It was also nominated for eight Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay for Larry McMurtry's and Bogdanovich's adaptation of McMurtry's novel. John Ford stalwart Johnson won Supporting Actor and Leachman won Supporting Actress, beating out their cohorts Bridges and Burstyn. For an audience steeped in movie history and caught up in the chaotic 1971 present, The Last Picture Show presented a nostalgic look backward that was not so much an escape from the present as a coming to terms with what the present had lost. Its 1990 sequel Texasville, in which Bridges and Shepherd played later incarnations of their original characters, was not as successful.",

            "content": "I had some high hopes for The Last Picture Show when I saw that it was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, because I\u2019ve never disliked any of his movies yet. The cast was also promising, as it featured a number of stars that I love including Jeff Bridges, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, and Eileen Brennan. However, this was not my style of film. I\u2019ll admit the acting was superb from most of the cast. All those stars that I love delivered amazing performances, and sold the heavy emotions of their scenes. In fact, there were a few of the older women who I wish were center stage more, because their stories were much more interesting to me than these teenagers. The only sub-par acting came from Cybill Shepherd. She is not terrible, but I couldn\u2019t follow her emotional journey, so the conniving and vile manipulation didn\u2019t feel motivated by anything. The movie looked great, and for once I actually understood the artistic purpose of black-and-white in a color era, and it didn\u2019t seem like a pretentious choice. My big problem is that I seldom enjoy coming of age films, so The Last Picture Show had an uphill battle to win me over. And this particular coming of age film is all about people that I find unpleasant. Also, it is primarily focused on the sexual aspect of their maturation, which doesn\u2019t interest me either. I\u2019m not drawn in by teens who seem solely motivated by their hormones, and who make zero logical choices. I recognize these aren\u2019t crazy or unrealistic characters, but they are the kind of people I spent my youth trying to avoid. I struggle to make myself care about the horny kid who will sleep with the coach\u2019s wife one minute and his best friend\u2019s girl the next. I am utterly turned off by the girl who wants to force her boyfriend to have sex just so she can sleep with another random dude. The Last Picture Show is loaded with well-told stories that feel like they are fairly timeless, even though they are clearly set in a particular time and place. I can see why this movie is critically-acclaimed and loved by others, despite the fact that it\u2019s unappealing to me.",

A supposed coming of age tale, where everybody acts like idiots and we're supposed to sympathise them because they're 'young and wild'. It's hard to tell what's worse here. The story, which is virtually non-existent; the acting, which is awful; or the pacing, which is sluggish to the point that it never feels like it's moving at all. Ben Johnson & Cloris Leachman, both of whom won acting Oscars, are barely in the film at all, and honestly don't deserve the awards for what they contribute to the film. The lead actor, Sam Bottoms, a man with one facial expression: Suffering from mild toothache, is a bad lead, and neither he nor any of the other principle characters ever become engaging, and in a movie which is over 2 hours long that makes for seriously dull viewing. It feels like it actually tries to be boring, as if wasting the audiences time is its sole reason for existing. There's so much dead air in the movie, with so little sound being used, even in scenes where there should at least be environmental noise like wind or the lapping of water against the shore. I often thought that the sound guy kept forgetting to come to work and score the film. Having watched a couple of scenes he probably decided it would be better to stay away from it all together, advice I sincerely wish I had followed.",

It is a pessimistic point of view whereas it centers on a couple of teenagers coming back from war doing what regular teenagers do.  The only purpose for the town to exist is so that truckers using it as a passersby upon carrying goods to another town- for none of the truckers stop for coffee.  We're then introduced to some teenage characters as they're going to the one theatre to watch movies and eating in the one diner, much of the original residents had already left.  No mention of policing or hospitals nearby we're not given the whole picture which limits viewers to this kind of format leaving us with nothing except the atmosphere, and that can sometimes not efficient to hold the movie.  Winner of two acting Oscars for Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman out of 8 nominations. \r\n\r\n2.5 out of 4 stars",

            "content": "Aesthetically, this adaptation of Larry McMurtry's story about disaffected, sex-crazed teens could hardly have been less designed to appeal to that demographic when it came out in 1971.  Set in a shriveled-up Texas town in the early 1950s, filmed in black and white with a soundtrack of Hank Williams songs, and featuring homages to old John Wayne and Spencer Tracy movies, there were few hints that the movie contained some of the raciest content possible in a mainstream release.  Which is not to say that its content was entirely new or cutting-edge; the bleaker and more mature \"Hud\" (1963, also based on a McMurtry novel) had shown a boy's coming-of-age in a dysfunctional, dying Texas town, and the more fashionable \"The Graduate\" (1967) had depicted a multi-generational love affair involving a younger man and an older woman.  What \"The Last Picture Show\" brings to its treatment of these themes is a larger, more diverse cast of characters who each embody a different facet of the community.  Some are unsatisfying archetypes and ciphers, like Ben Johnson's \"Sam the Lion,\" and \"Billy,\" a mentally-disabled child.  Most, though, are sufficiently complicated and believable, particularly the women played by Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, and Cybill Shepherd.  Shepherd had no previous acting experience, but carries much of the movie on her shoulders and nails all of the big and little things about her character.",

It has everything: lost love, false love, death of a father figure, loss of friendship, loss of innocence, and loss of dreams. The story takes place in a town that doesn't exist, and probably never should exist, because everyone in town is unfulfilled, unhappy, and lost all ambition. But the film is absolutely perfect in its portrayal of a lost time, a time where everything looked up, but then everything went down and so did everyone's happiness. The narrative plays out like a good old fashioned picture, but it adds in the depth of 1970's filmmaking, and the result, is one of my favorite films of all time. Bogdanovich creates the perfect desolate tone with ever shot, which only contributes more to the feeling of lifelessness in this small town. But he also stays true to the notion that this is a fictitious town by conveying a sense that this town exists only in itself, that this town is not real, but is a representation of what all towns and people feel at this point in time and modern times for that matter. The Last Picture Show is truly a masterpiece that ever teenager should watch.",

Granted, there's more at work here beyond that, it's still impossible to deny that all other elements take a back seat to the overall subtext at work. With this in mind, no single component takes more of a hit than the pacing. Combined with the fact that this is already a relatively quiet and subtle experience for most of its running time anyway, \"The Last Picture Show's\" deliberate cadence will be sure to try the patience of at least some viewers. When all is said and done, though, I'm also sure there'll be some sort of ethical/psychological/sociological kernel of knowledge that everyone will take away from the experience.",
