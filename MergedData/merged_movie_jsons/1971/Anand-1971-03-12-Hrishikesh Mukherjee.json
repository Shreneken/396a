            "content": "What an outstanding movie!! I have heard all the prior generation people rave about this movie, so, I decided to check this movie out myself. I only have faint memories of having watched parts of this movie from my mom's lap when she and dad were watching this in the theater. The other reason why I decided to check this out was a Super-bowl half-time debate on whether Amitabh was better than Rajesh Khanna. I could not participate in this debate for two reasons: first, I was eagerly awaiting another \"wardrobe malfunction\" for one of the cheerleaders and secondly, I only had memories of one Rajesh Khanna movie, Haathi Mere Saathi. I remember having enjoyed it very much as a child. But that alone was not enough to quantify anything. The more recent performances of AB were fresh in my mind, but after having seen this movie, I decided that Rajesh had a class of his own. His chirpy performance in this movie is really unparalleled! What an amazing performance! Amitabh, being more junior, has not equaled Rajesh, but has done his share very well. Thus, even after watching this movie, the debate will continue.What's New? What can possibly be new in an old movie? Guess what? there is plenty for the younger generation to take away! There is no education in the movies these days, whatsoever, except perhaps bedroom or bar sequences. The inadequacies in the field of medicine are so nicely brought forward by this movie, which is certainly over 30 years old! Now, I can understand why Munnabhai MBBS was such a hit. It had so beautifully adapted from this movie to match the present generation. Kudos to Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Sanjay Dutt (& Kamal Hassan too) for carrying this forward.Noticeable: \"BaaabuMushaai\", the nick name for Amitabh, as heard from Rajesh throughout the movie, will ring in your ears even hours after you have seen the six letters \"The End\" on the screen. There really is no end to such people! Some sequences were simply amazing. Those that stood apart in my mind were the last scene, with a tape that had a significant pause in between; the moun-vrath guru, who so symbolically said that there is so much more than the decaying body to Anand's soul; then of course the Munirbhai sequences and the eventual backfiring of this strategy and so many more! The songs were so gentle and heart warming! The comic timing of Rajesh Khanna was simply amazing! Verdict Present day filmmakers really need to rework their brains and start thinking much much better! There is much more to Hindi cinema than just skin-show and catchy item number songs. This is a MUST-WATCH movie! I did not think so when others told me, but having experienced it myself, I believe them! I am gonna check out the other MUST-WATCH movies prescribed by the previous generation.",

            "content": "Rajesh Khanna had always won acclaim and registered his credits in the box office hits, whenever he portrayed a sentimental, morally strong and emotionally focused role. He also did a great job in SAFAR, wherein he portrayed a similar role of a cancer stricken patient.Nevertheless, he is not well at portraying the roles of \"an angry man\", \"a fighting sequence\", \"an overly volatile role\" and \"clownish comedy roles\" that can all be performed in a masterly manner by his arch rival, Amitabh Bachan.However, Rajesh Khanna's personification of a lively, vivacious, death defying and winsome portrayal of a cancer stricken man was stupendously performed. His person consummately excels in mimicking soft, romantic, sad, morose and boisterously exuberant roles.Many people contend that Amitabh would had done a better characterization if he had been offered an author backed role instead of Rajesh Khanna in ANAND. Here it may be kept in mind that Amitabh could not match a stunning performance in MILLI, where his real life spouse Jaya Bahaduri outperformed him. The bullock cart scene immediately followed by the song \"Kaheen door jab din dhal Jaye\" in ANAND speaks volumes of the excellently crafted direction of Hirsihkish Mukherjee and has enlisted his name among all time great directors. This song and the one \"Zindagi Kaisi he Paheli\" touch the latent strings of sublime imagination with poignant originality, which cannot even remotely be identified anywhere, among the fast, untamed, crazy and meaningless songs of this age of Indian Cinema ......which seems to be overly swamped by the temporal, vulgar and money minting mentality of the producers, directors and actors.That is to say, there is nothing worthwhile in contemporary cinema, which happens to be laden with tawdry vulgarity and incompetent intellectual standing, vis-a-vis the cerebral and in-depth creativity of movie makers of erstwhile days.",

            "content": "It is very rare for guys to shed tears after watching a movie, this movie does make you shed tears for Anand, the main protagonist played by the superstar of the 70's Rajesh Khanna.The movie has everything going for it. Acting, direction, story, music, dialogues etc... everything is fabulous. It has drama, humor, emotions in dollops. It is a story a dying man who looks at life with a positive attitude and enjoys his time knowing  fully well his disease is incurable and that he is going to die soon.Rajesh Khanna as Anand is absolutely brilliant, this is his career-best performance , notwithstanding movies like Kati Patang, Roti, Aradhana, Amar Prem etc. You cannot think of any other actor in this role and to think Rajesh Khanna was not the original choice(Shashi Kapoor was). He makes you laugh and cry. He causes anxiety and goose bumps. Simply superb.Amitabh Bachchan is fantastic as babumoshai( a name with which Raj Kapoor used to address the film's director Hrishikesh Mukherjee). He showed the world that the next superstar was coming, though he really \"arrived\" a couple of years later. The rest of the supporting cast is also brilliant be it Johhny Walker(stands out) or Ramesh Deo or Seema or Sumitra. Everyone is wonderful.Music is the hallmark of all great hindi movies and this one has music ranking right up there, on the top. Be it \"Kahin door jab din dhal jaye\" or \" Maine tere liye hi saath rang\" or \"Zindagi kaisi hai paheli\".\nMaverick composer Salil Chowdury comes up with an absolutely fantastic score and singers Mukhesh and Manna Dey do complete justice to his tunes.About the director Hrishikesh Mukherjee, what can one say, he is one of the best directors ever in the Indian film history. A guy with a complete repertoire,a complete entertainer (though people consider other  directors to be more entertaining, but real movie buffs will agree with me). All his movies, he has been directing movies since 1957 are worth a watch. Some are brilliant and others watchable. None of his movies can be rated as unwatchable(except maybe Jooth bole Kauwa kaate and Jhooti).Simply put, this is one of the best Hindi movies ever made.",

            "content": "Hrishikesh Mukherjee has enriched Hindi cinema with such masterpieces as Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Mili, Abhimaan, Bawarchi, Khubsoorat. All of them relatively low on budget and high in quality. To think of it that he was directing at the breakneck speed of more than two movies a year. Mukherjee's movies were light hearted comic dramas, Anand too is comical at times. His other movies featured people struggling to keep a job, or fancying a marriage to film star, or struggling to keep up with a practical joke, Anand on the other hand is about struggling to live the short life you have.Anand is without doubt the best (and most popular) of Mukherjee's works. Rajesh Khanna's role as Anand, a patient with 'Lymphosarcoma (cancer) of the intestine' is probably his best acting ever. How Anand fights cancer brings tears to your eyes, even if you see this movie for the umpteenth. You laugh with Anand, you cry with him, you sing with him, you live the life he lives. Amitabh Bachchan's (Dr Banerjee) role of his square faced Bengali doctor, in a role so different from the roles that made him a superstar, (Bachchan was voted the greatest actor ever in the online BBC pole, though he played it down saying - this proves Indians do not have much to do on Internet) Amitabh does a wonderful job. Being a Bollywood movie that it is, there are some beautiful songs. I wonder - a Hollywood movie with songs is called a musical and all Bollywood movies are characterised as song and dance sequences. This is a stereotype that a lot of Hindi Movies won't fit into (then there are a lot that will). Anand for one has no dance sequence. Lot of beautiful songs though, that help the narrative and in character development like acting can't.For example you never see Anand unhappy for a second. You think he has no sorrows. Even the name of his illness is something to enjoy. Lymphosarcoma of the intestine is quite a name to have for a disease, Anand says in his ever cheerful voice (the word Anand means pleasure btw). Deep inside Anand knows he has limited time in the world and he wants to fill every life that he touches with happiness. In the process he starts growing closer to you. He talks to a complete stranger on the street like he knew him forever. He shares the sorrows of people he meets, gives them reason to smile. But never will let you into his own sad past. It is only through a song (a sort of soliloquy) he sings that you get a bit of information about his sad past - he himself wont share it with you.The movie won the 1972 Filmfare Award. One of the best works to come out of Bollywood.",

            "content": "In 1970, Rajesh Khanna was the biggest star and was shooting for multiple movies along with Anand. But it seems he would take some time out from his other schedules would come to Hrishi da and ask him if he could shoot the next scene from Anand. That's how eager and dedicated he was to Anand. Probably he knew that this was the movie that he would be remembered for.The movie narrates like the pages of a diary of one Dr. Bhaskar Bannerjee and his relationship with Anand Sehgal who he treated for cancer. Despite of such a heavy theme the movie is high spirited just like Anand Sehgal who likes to laugh in the face of death. Special mention should be made for attention given to each character in the movie. All the characters are well etched and everyone has given a truly inspired performance.The last sequence must be the most dramatic sequence that I have seen in any movie. Music by Salil Chaudhary and lyrics by Yogesh and Gulzar are apt and wonderful. Definitely one of the best movies made in India.",

            "content": "I saw this movie at the tender age of 13, the era, when Shammi Kapoor was rollicking on the slopes of Kashmir screaming yahoo! Yes, this word was invented by Shammi Kapoor! who I hear is a computer buff, I wonder if he has Yahoo email..yahoo@yahoo.com! When you can remember when and where you saw a movie it says something about the impact it made on you. A haunting melody, an exuberant performance, or a damsel actress that you had a secret crush on (I should confess that it was Asha Parekh!) So the scene that was struck in my young mind was, Rajesh Khanna, singing \"Kahin Door Jab Din Dhal Jaaye\"...a haunting melody by any standards. So, when I wanted to watch a movie in solitude, one of my few choices was \"Anand\". I wanted the nostalgia that only a good movie can bring. Yes, the movie not only brought nostalgia, but also brought tears, melancholy and sadness, at which time, I realized, that a great director has worked me over. No one could have done justice to portraying a cancer stricken patient as Rajesh Khanna did in this classic. Khanna, was an upcoming actor at that time, and somehow the films he starred had some enchanting melodies and hummable tunes. \"Anand\", is one of the rare movies you enjoy watching because there is this silence afterwords, where words spoken would be a nuisance. The performance is subtle as compared to some of the garish over acting that we see by the imbecile Khans in the latter year movies so much so you hope there is never be a remake of this. This is one of the best performance by an actor, wherever this profession is practiced. Like any good movie, this was an amalgamation of talent, like the direction of Hrishikesh Mukherjee, music of Salil Chaudhry and a fine supporting cast that included Amitab Bachchan, who, incidentally, is subdued. That leaves me wondering if he was watching and learning from a great fellow actor at work. All said and done, this movie is etched in my memory, so much so, this is one of the Top Ten Indian Movies on my short list. Yes, a sheer Poetry in Motion.",

Anand is a movie which speaks more than it scripts. It tells us more than its characters narrates the story. The impressive character no doubt is of Rajesh Khannna, but Amitabh is too much impressive. The \"Anand\" tells us how a man decided and then spent rest of his short life. A Man who had short time, but he wanted to live too much. for him, not the quantity but quality of life does matter. I recommend to see this movies more than once. And every time u see this movie, u'll end up with more brighter definition of film and life. The movie is too simple to narrate here, and tooo deep to express what i actually think about it.",

Ultimately Rajesh khanna leaves not before leaving a message of love and happiness. Amitabh Bachchan was at his best. This was the first movie when he was seriously noticed by Bollywood. He exceed expectations. A versatile actor this is one of his many movies where he plays a role of serious, angry young man who hardly smiles.

            "content": "a masterpiece, though is better appreciated if you've had an Indian upbringing, especially in the kind of life we used to live in the last century. but that should not stop anybody's heart from being moistened by Anand - its that kind of a film which makes you feel that cloudy ball in your throat, a feeling we hardly have today.i never saw Anand on big screen, i.e. a theater, didn't get a chance to. but seen it countless number of times i have, each leaving me haunted by that epic last scene, and each letting me discover another gleam in its brilliance.A great story, in fact that storyness of it struck me first, its difficult to come across a character like Anand's (Rajesh Khanna)in real life, laughing his way to the end. it is for souring such larger-than-lifeness one sees cinemas at times. Amitabh as Dr. Bhaskar with wells of life just under his brooding exterior, was a giveaway at such an early stage of his career that he was destined for a place much beyond the ordinary.Hrishikesh Mukherjee crafted it to perfection. Salil chowdhury excelled with some of the most melodious tunes ever and the co actors could reach the lofty heights the film dared them to.but finally it was Rajesh Khanna. yes a shade melodramatic, a touch idiosyncratic may be but you can't deny the vivacity with which he demands your attention, slowly takes over your heart and you don't want him to die and when he does your tears tell you that you just been watching a film.yeah some films can make you do that. not a tear jerker, but a weller-up of them. its not good in a way though, 'cause it makes you search for such standards ever since, and the disappointment is bitter. but then there's always the DVD and the remote!",

Similarly, a nurse D'souza created a similar affection for him in just a few meetings. All characters are too emotional to be called humans.Rajesh Khanna knew how to play two or three characters. And in his whole career, he just kept working on such roles, that made him the biggest superstar ever. His acting, like always, is nothing short of convincing, but nothing exceptional either.Music is heart of the film. The person who wrote the lyrics, sorry, I forgot his name, never worked again. That's really surprising as this is easily among the top 30 -40 music albums I know.Anand wants to live a happy life, of which a little is remaining and so always keeps smiling.

            "content": "\"Babu Moshai, Zindagi Aur Maut ke Khel Mein Hum Sab Katputhli Hain\" An immortal piece of dialog from an immortal movie Anand. Many a Hindi movie starts of well,but falters pretty badly in the climax. Anand was one of the few movies which grips you from start to end. Its one of the few movies which has an unforgettable climax.Consider this the eponymous character Anand(Rajesh Khanna) lies on the bed dying. Babu Moshai(Amitabh Bachan) enters the room. He cannot bear to see his friend lying still on death bed. He holds him and shakes him up weeping uncomfortably\"Tum Mujhe Aisa Chod Ke Nahin Ja Saakte\"\"20 mahine se mein tera bak bak sun raha hoon\"\"Baate Karo Mujhshe\" And then as if on cue, the tape recorder plays \"Babu Moshai, Babu Moshai, Zindagi aur Maut Ki Khel Mein Hum Sab Katputhli Hain, Yahan kya hote hai, na tum jaane na main Sab Upar Wale ki Haath Meiin\" The ghostly way in which the voice appears and the equally eerie laughter, creates such a haunting impact, that a shiver runs down my spine every time i watch this scene. It's as if Anand is speaking through his spirit, and even after death he still continues to live.Anand is a masterpiece of the first order by Hrishida and one of my all time fav movies. Now an interesting thing regarding the dedication of Anand. It wad dedicated to Raj Kapoor and the city of Mumbai.The Raj Kapoor connection was easy to make out, as he was Hrishida's best buddy in real life. Hrishida got his first commercial success with Raj Kapoor's Anari and Raj Kapoor got the best actor award for the movie. They were as different as chalk and cheese. While Raj Kapoor was the typical loud Punjabi extrovert,,Hrishida was the very epitome of the Bengali Babu with his sober intellectual demeanour. Also Hrishida's movies were aimed at the common man, and pretty sober and minimalist in nature, while RK was a showman par excellence with his penchant for larger than life canvas and huge settings. Hrishida himself admitted that Anand's character was based on RK's and he didn't cast RK as he couldn't bear to see his friend die on screen also. For his part Anand was a movie always close to RK's heart.Regarding the Mumbai connection, i feel the story of Anand is somewhat linked to that of Mumbai. One could be that Hrishida made his career in Mumbai and i guess this was his way of saying thank you to the city which made him. Most of Hrishida's best movies have been Mumbai centric \"Anand\", \"Mili\",\"Abhimaan\",\"Gol Maal\" to name a few. Also like Anand, Mumbai is a city which though beset with innumerable problems like slums, crime, pollution, overcrowding still manages to survive and live every day. Life is not easy for an average Mumbaikar, what with all those overcrowded trains, high prices, crime rate but he/she still has a zeal for life, which is rarely found anywhere else. Its a city which gets back to normal life even after a couple of bomb blasts have destroyed large chunks. Its a city where dreams are made and realized. Its a city where people face a daily struggle and yet have an inexhaustible zest for life,much like Anand, who knows he will die but takes death head on as he says \"Babu Moshai, zindag Badi Hone chahiye, Lambi nahin\". Mumbai is a city that dies a thousand deaths daily, but never loses its love for life. Anand is a man who knows he is to die, but makes the best of his limited life.",

            "content": "overrated, yes, but this is still a good film... maybe even a great film... but one cannot escape the fact that a MUCH greater film could have been made. 'anand' is clearly based on legendary Japanese director akira kurosawa's classic 'ikiru', which is simply one of the greatest films ever made. it tells a real story, without singing, dancing and jokes, and confronts death directly, rather than dancing around the issue until the last 20 minutes.'anand' simply misses the point. the first two-thirds of the film serve to introduce YET ANOTHER fast-talking, happy-go-lucky, smiling young man (a horribly clich\u00e9d and overused character, who must appear in just about every bollywood film) who is so annoying that you can't wait to see him die. this is the primary weakness of this film - you cannot stand the main character! at least in 'ikiru', we witness the transformation of a quiet, morose soul into a great man. but in this film, no such change occurs and no point is made. it's just about a guy who dies.if you're going to make a movie about death, there should be at least a SOME discussion about it, not covering it up with songs and jokes. this is cheating the audience, who are watching to see a story about a certain theme and are instead tricked into yet another tearjerking bollywood melodrama. what was the point of trying to get bhaskar married? what was the point of anand joining a theatre group? these were wasted moments that could have been used to explore death, but of course, a mainstream Indian film will NEVER be so serious, so we're given what Indian audiences REALLY want: weddings, songs, cheap sentimentality and silly jokes.however, the performances are quite good and the storyline, although a wasted opportunity, is still far away from the formula of most mainstream Hindi films. if you enjoyed the themes of this film, but want a deeper exploration, drop what you're doing right now and watch akira kurosawa's 'ikiru'.... no weddings, no jokes, no happy-go-lucky annoying guys running around, and only one unforgettable song....",

The only reason I would reccomend this is to get the experience of Bollywood movies of early 70's.",

Anand's behaviour soon rubs off on the doctor.A well-meaning film: its themes of dealing with death, living life to the fullest, staying positive and lifting other up have great merit and are well worth exploring.However, the film never really makes the most of these foundations and meanders along. The character of Anand is often more annoying than uplifting. There are some good comedic moments but those would be the rare highlights.Also, in terms of profoundness and poignancy, the humour and levity (or attempts at them) detract from these, making for a film that's neither fish nor fowl: too light-hearted to be taken seriously and too sombre a subject to laugh at.",

            "content": "\"Anand\" is an Indian film that stars two of the very biggest Indian stars of all time, Rajesh Khanna (who plays the title character) and Amitabh Bachchan (Dr. Bannerjee). It's considered a classic and I appreciate how the film deals with death, as few films really address this in any meaningful way.The movie begins with Dr. Bannerjee receiving an award for his book. However, while folks think the story is fiction, he addresses them about the story of his friend and patient, Anand. It seems that Anand was diagnosed with terminal cancer and he has no family nor friends*. Instead of being miserable, he is very vivacious and takes a very positive attitude. He's not in denial--he just wants to make the most of his time left. He also wants to leave something positive for those around him--and he decides, in particular, to help his new friend, Dr. Bannerjee.What makes this film interesting is that through the course of the film, you notice that Anand is okay with death. After all, he can't avoid it. It's everyone around him (particularly Dr. Bannerjee) who cannot accept it. Plus, how many films REALLY address death and dying in a meaningful way? Certainly not many. This alone makes the film well worth seeing. However, a minor quibble I have is about the DVD producer. They didn't bother captioning ANY of the songs--so you really have no idea what Anand is singing about throughout the film! Jerks!*First, it's interesting that a year ago, Khanna actually DID die from cancer. Second, the one problem I saw with the film was the notion of Anand coming to the big city because he had no family. However, he is SO likable and wonderful, you can't really expect that he wouldn't have TONS of friends where he lived--so why come to a new city?",

Not being of Indian background, and watching the movie without subtitles, I was astonished to hear the only two words I understood in the movie as 'lymphosarcoma intestine'. Though I'm sure I missed a lot of the nuance in the story, it's more than evident that the title character, portrayed by Rajesh Khanna, had a zest for life and imparted that attitude to everyone he came in contact with. While those who get to know him lament and cry over his condition, Anand imparts an attitude that's inspiring and life affirming in the face of his impending mortality. Not only that, but he helps Dr. Bhaskar K. Bannerjee (Amitabh Bachchan) learn about what's important in life as well, helping him to see beyond the day to day drudgery of attending patients who are sick or dying of illness due to poverty. Even with such a serious subject at the center of the story, the film manages to include four singing numbers and an interrupted dance sequence that appears to be a staple of Hindi films, including one performance by the title character himself. In Hindi, the word 'anand' means happiness, and the film stands as a testament to the virtue of maintaining a positive attitude in the face of adversity with a resolve to bring joy to others.",

The film starts off with the present day with the introduction of Big B and then the flashback of Anand Amitji is shown as an angry young man, a frustrated doctor who is honest unlike his friend yet he seems very distressed about the turn of events. RK comes a whiff in fresh air, He seems full of life despite knowing that he is about to die and slowly changes the way of living of Big B. Hrishikesh's MILI(1975) depicted a similar story where Jaya played the cancer patient and Big B played a similar role. There are several superb scenes like the relationship between Rajesh and the matron Lalita Pawar. The Amit- RK scenes, The film has several emotional and funny scenes all well balanced. The film does have some forced scenes like the pehelwan fight by Dara Singh and some more scenes but otherwise the film is superb The climax scene is still remembered as one of the best death scenesDirection by HM is superb, this film made him a director to reckon with Music is superb, Zindagi Kaisi hai Paheli by Manna Dey is classic, Maine Tere Liye too is superb, Kahin door also stands out Kishore Kumar doesn't sing any song strangely for RK.Rajesh Khanna lives the role of ANAND and does a splendid job, balancing emotions with comedy superbly, His chemistry with Bachchan is superb and they acted together for last time till date in HM's NAMAK HARAAM(1973) Amitabh Bachchan played second fiddle to RK but did a great job, looking unlike his AYM days forthcoming, He does a superb job and got the filmfare award for best supporting role. Sumita Sanyal is alright Johny Walker is superb in his short role Ramesh Deo as Dr Kulkarni and Seema Deo as Mrs.Kulkarni are likable Asit Sen is funny The film won several awards like Best actor, best story",

Yet, he chooses to live the last days by being happy, meeting people and being friends and he befriends Bhaskar.Mukherjee shows us a wonderful contrast between Bhaskar's and Anand's personalities. We see Bhaskar as a frustrated workaholic and Anand as the happy-go-lucky, cheerful and playful teaser who's also an artist. Once Anand enters Bhaskar's life, Bhaskar learns how to live.Rajesh Khanna plays the title role and is wonderful. I tend to avoid his movies but I'm glad I didn't miss this one. I've never been a fan of Amitabh Bachchan and really disliked everything he did since the 80's. In 'Anand' he is brilliant. Comparatively, his screen time is more limited but he makes the best of it. Lalita Pawar and Johnny Walker leave a mark with their brief roles.The songs are beautiful and they add to the narrative. Salil Chowdhury's score is memorable.If you haven't seen Anand, go and watch it otherwise you'll not know what you missed.",

They dread the day he will die as it nears, yet he remains steadfast. He changes the lives of those around him. Great Story.Perhaps the most moving scene is when Anand dies, he cannot bear the pain of his death, not for himself, but for his best friend Bamushai. A shocking selflessness at a moment where he is at his most true(his death bed) In the end there is a real sense of transcendence, you real feel a triumph over the concept of death. The best example is the voice recording. Anand has died, but the recording plays on, so in memory Anand will live on, eternally. It should really be a tragic story, but this is an uplifting story about a damned man. Well worth watching more than once.",

The film is about state of mind broadly.I have seen this film may be more than a hundred times and if you ask me to watch it 5 times back to back right now I will do it. There cannot be a film as divine and at the same time as entertaining as Anand. This movie has been like 'Ramayan' for me eversince I watched it on doordarshan as may be a 6 years old. Dialogs by Gulzar is genius work, characterization is wonderful, music is excellent, acting is fantastic, editing is crisp, direction is definite, cinematography is minimal and message is divine. Last scene of the film is the best scene ever written and enacted in the history of Cinema. \"Batein karo mujhse\" still makes my hair stand at its end even when I think about it. All my friends agree that if we were to chose one performance , out of all the films Bachchan's, we would chose Dr Bhaskar Banerjee. Still the interesting fact is that its not a Bachchan film and is a Rajesh Khanna film. May be we are all wrong. Its simply Hrishi da and Gulzar sahib film. Anand cannot be made again. 10/10",

Probably he knew that this was the movie that he would be remembered for.The movie narrates like the pages of a diary of one Dr. Bhaskar Bannerjee and his relationship with Anand Sehgal who he treated for cancer. Despite of such a heavy theme the movie is high spirited just like Anand Sehgal who likes to laugh in the face of death. Special mention should be made for attention given to each character in the movie. All the characters are well etched and everyone has given a truly inspired performance.The last sequence must be the most dramatic sequence that I have seen in any movie.

Damn, life is so very cruel, it takes even the best for a ride and ends abruptly.Anand knew his destiny and he wanted to live every moment of it, so did I as saw each scene of the movie. However disconnected the other person his, Anand makes a connection in every which way and all the characters along with myself as an audience hoped for a different ending which was not to be.I saw this movie innumerable times (which means just too many) and each time, I had tears in my eyes, the climax is simply unbearable for me but I just watch it all through each time. There is no fast forward or rewind button in life and that applies to this movie. Each time I start this, i just complete it.Rare to see movies as good as this. How much ever I appreciate I very deeply feel that is too very less.Dialogues by Gulzar are impeccable, editing, screenplay and direction by Hirshikesh Mukherjee and all alive and they are characters no more, those are alive beings and Anand is a prime example of a willing to live protagonist. The sotry and characters are simply heart touching and deeply moving. But Rajesh Khanna brought life to Anand is his very own way and his charm, there is that subtle warmth that you always want to meet him and see him in full life. Amitabh brought his very own dignity to Dr. Banerjee. All other characters played their roles very well. Can't say much with moist throat and eyes. It's undoubtedly 5/5 and one of the best Indian films ever. It will definitely move every Indian who watches it. I am pretty happy to see this time and over again.",

A man who is already aware of his death time and who covers all this thing under the darkness of smile and laugh. All the time throughout the movie Anand utters that he can't even think about living in silence. That's his gasoline to push his car in the journey of life.

Before he meets, he is informed by his friend, Dr. Kulkarni, that Anand is terminally ill and suffers from cancer of the intestine and that he has only six months to live. During this time, Anand brings happiness and joy to everyone around him, when he, himself is hiding his own sorrows and pain. The movie also goes on to depict the relationship between a doctor and a patient.The playback is superbly given by the late Mukesh, the ever classical Manna Dey and the nightingale of India, Lata Mangeshkar. The songs that I still remember, after over thirty years, are: \"Zindagi Kaisi Hai Pehli\" by Manna Dey and, \"Sanj Ki Dulhan,\" by the late Mukesh. The ending is perhaps the most memorable even today and a lot of current Bollywood directors have gone on to comment that the scene where the tape is shown running and Dr. Bannerjee walking up to Anand as he lies on his death bed, is the best scene. It still manages to bring tears in me.Anand is a worthwhile to watch with family members. Amitabh Bachchan was struggling as an actor at the time and it was this movie that brought him recognition as an actor. Today! He is Bollywoods's superstar. Incidentally, the part of Anand was first offered to the late Kishore Kumar, who rejected it and was then offered to the then superstar, Rajesh Khanna and was dedicated to Hrishikesh Mukerjee's friend and an actor, Raj Kapoor.",

His life was changed first by his illness and after by the advice of a friend of his but he will also change the lives of other people too.I liked this movie because it is a life lesson for many people since it presents very well a difficult subject and how people face it from a different perspective. The interpretations of both Amitabh Bachchan who played as Dr. Bhaskar K. Bannerjee / Babu Moshai and Rajesh Khanna who played as Anand Saigal were simply outstanding. The direction which was made by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, it was very good and I believe that he did an excellent job on it because he succeeded on making us not only understand the feelings of his main characters but also to relate with them. Lastly, I have to say that \"Anand\" is a beautiful movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.",

I have no problem with any one moment or interaction in the film, but as a whole it is the same thing over and over.",

This is the rarest of cinema; this is the reason why a motion picture is such an important medium of art, maybe the most important medium of art.I'm at a loss of words to describe it. I cannot explain in simple words how such an economic work can be so breathtakingly beautiful and powerful at the same time. That was Hrishikesh Mukherjee's magic. He was the Rebel filmmaker of his time. When all other Directors made mindless larger than life films where The Hero & the Heroin ran around tress and wept like babies, Hrishikesh Mukherjee made films that had simple themes, characters we could relate to and the whole movie had a Middle Class set up, something thats extinct in today's movies.It is a work of great intelligence and subtle intensity, every frame greatly observant of the varying moods. I'm at a loss of words at describing how affected I was by this movie at the moment, but all I can say is this is one of the finest motion pictures I have seen. ANAND represents cinema at its finest, at its peak- accessible to the lowest commonest denominator yet compromising nowhere on quality. I just cannot stress enough how wonderfully gentle and beautiful this movie was, and such a wonderful character study.Rajesh Khanna so effectively captures the easy going personality of the protagonist Anand Saigal. Part of it owes to his previous effort at playing the same man in the film SAFAR but we would know him more from movies like Aradhana and Amar Prem. This film also marks the arrival of Amitabh Bachchan, and he's fantastic as Dr. Bhaskar Banerjee. Dara Singh is also excellent in a sweet cameo as a Pahalwaan.I strongly Pooh-Pooh Karan Johar & Nikhil Adavani for stealing Anand's plot and making a Trashy & Crappy Kal Ho Na Ho which was not even 0.0000000000000001% close to Anand.",

There's real heart to what unfolds, even if by modern standards it may be too sentimental for some. Personally, I think the earnestness of it all mostly worked.Acting is strong, it's nicely shot, and I really liked the music, too.

Rajesh khanna was great in the title role.He expressed the emotions and expressions of a terminally ill man so beautifully.It was one of the best performances of his career.Amitabh bachhan was also outstanding.He expressed the subjugation of a helpless doctor so nicely.Supporting cast was also very good. Musical score of the movie was outstanding.Every song of the movie was so deep and powerful.Every song contained a metaphor about life. Direction of the movie is another strong point.Hrishikesh da never faultered and gave us another masterpiece.Editing is also very nice as the film was so short.The dialogues of the movie were so deep and meaningful.It is a must watch for everyone.If you are in a mood to watch something great then this is definitely for you. 9.3 out of 10 from my side.",

Anand is a movie which refuses to grow old with time, in fact gets better with time. Initially i didn't get the pathos of the movie as i was kid when i watched it which was good because this movie offers something to everyone, funny moments, philosophy, pathos, love , romance, songs, thrill and everything. Two legendary actors, Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan where first and if i am right for the only time Rajesh Khanna over shadowed Amitabh in the movie, not only Amitabh he over shadowed everyone but still all the characters stand with their own gumption. Johny Walker was good, not a surprise and his character was one of the best written. Ramesh Deo too stands good as he was regular in the films back there and in his rare appearances of a good man. Hrishikesh Mukherjee was not a human being, he was a phenomena that cannot be explained. People today are doing research on his movies and this is true. The movie is rumored to be based on the life of Mukherjee's close friend Raj Kapoor, another great Indian actor and director whom he used to call 'Babu Moshay' with love, which incidentally what Amitabh was referred in the movie by Rajesh Khanna.Must watch and it is one of the movie you don't want to die without seeing.

It was a film where I could live together in different emotions. Life is really short and we can't know when death will come. We should always laugh. Instead of sadness, grief, humiliation or unhappiness, we should be able to make people laugh. I hope people with inner peace come to the world and rule the world. We can see a world where peace and happiness reigns and wars end. We can have a positive mindset. It is possible to live a quiet life instead of anger and hatred.

The first half of the movie had nothing special but the second half is when they kept piling melodrama on top of melodrama.

            "review_title": "A different sea of joy!",
            "content": "Anand means joy. The central character Anand, the protagonist of a noble philosophy of life is a cheerful urban loner who has been suffering from cancer. Bhaskar, who comes of a different linguistic region, is highly affectionate and respectful to his ever-restless friend Anand due to his enthusiasm, indomitable philanthropic passion and optimism about life. In recognition of his feelings to his friend, Anand is fond of calling Bhaskar with a different nickname \"Babumasai\", which means \"great gentleman\". Bhaskar in spite of being a good and serious physician fails to delay the death of Anand and mourns a lot commemorating the precious moments with the great man, whom he could not cure. An urban Indian setting beside a sea provides the narrative with a meaningful physical backdrop.The directorial experiment of idealizing an ever-lively individual Anand in keeping with the mannerism of the star actor Rajesh Khanna is proved to be unforgettable professional success in Indian cinema. Another historical contribution of the film is the invaluable exposure and success of a great Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan in characterizing Bhaskar at the earliest phase of Bachchan's career. For the spectators today the speed of the narrative is sometimes unnecessarily slow, but the criticism should not count wonderful editing. Hrishikesh Mukherjee in extension of his previous reputed editing experience offered a simple and compact narrative of popularizing a serious urban theme with tragic end. An acceptable script, which is full of good humor and touch of humanist emotion, supports the overall indifference to death and urban loneliness. Salil Chowdhury presents several wonderful songs, which have remained exceptional in their lyrics and melody. Perhaps, Hrishikesh Mukherjee is one of the pioneers in framing and editing musical shots in Indian movie.Another significant aspect of the film is the organic network of the characters in representing a humanitarian tragic narrative. The four major character positions are Anand, Bhaskar who is Annad's Babumasai, a few less prominent females and the less known supportive urban identities. Almost none of them are negatively featured. The central and most interesting dyad is Anand-Babumasai relationship. The ideal construct of a traditionally steady, professionally successful, introvert, married Indian male character of Bhaskar is contrast to boyishly insistent, restless, talkative and softhearted Anand, who is very sociable and also decisively withdrawn from any love relation, but highly committed to friendship. Both of them have positive attitude towards femininity, but in practice they differ. After the death of Anand while Bhaskar cries his heart out in acknowledging his overwhelming greatness, two contrary characters finally become complementary to each other with respect to the orientation of the narrative. A viewer gets four major positions in order to identify their emotion. One may identify with Anand, who might appear greater than ideal male identity of Bhaskar. One may find out a Bhaskar in himself. One may like to appreciate and respect the relationship. One may feel himself/herself less responsive to the height of the local construct of emotion, a union of joy and sadness. The last position is unlikely to be the focus of the film. Any positive response to the film indicates the success of a different representation of urban Indian ideals and optimism.",

Our TV was on the blink and I happened to be there. Sundays were movie nights on TV and we had, but one channel in those days that we could tune to. It was Doordarshan - controlled by the govt. and only had broadcasts for a few hours every evening. I saw the movie and by the end of it, I was inconsolable and cried all the way back to my home (a small walk taking me 4-5 apartment buildings away) and was depressed for a few hours thereafter. Fantastic! I would STRONGLY recommend that people see this movie and see a movie that is classy in its treatment of the subject as well as the characterisations of the principal actors. The plot is not particularly rich - and it is mostly emotional - a (very slight) hint of romance, good songs and a brilliant ending (which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling it).",

From technical and cinematic points of view it hasn't aged as good, but every Indian cinema or Bollywood interested person will get a lot of joy out this movie.Rajesh Khanna is the star of the movie and \"sells\" the titular character from the beginning.The film is over before you realize it with just over 2 hours runtime. And not everything is perfect: The story is sometimes a bit over the place which some very short scenes and some characters and interactions that definitely could have done with more development. It purely speak to the fact that you want to see more of everyone. Another point is blurry screens en editing where the screen flicks in a distracting way. It is an older movie, but most of it contemporaries had a bit more flow in it. It might make you wonder if this is one of the few Hindi golden era movies where a reimagining would do it well. (who would fill those shoes of Rajesh). Having so many icons together will make many people happy. Ramesh Deo does a very good job as Dr Prakash. And although Amitabh doesn't shine as much as Rajesh does: it's still warming to have them in a movie together. Knowing the actors, Mumbai cinema and understanding the songs will add to experience. For western audiences it might be a big dramatic and unrealistic, but for people who get the culture there will be more dept. this is one of the few movie that moved people regardless of gender.The songs by Mukesh and Manna Dey are outstanding and are blended in with the film nicely. No jumping around in Switzerland from trees or in the snow.Overall as a first time watched be prepared to laugh out loud and to have a beautiful story and part of our cinema touch you.Small background about myself: Dutch/Indian 80s kid here, watched this film first time just before reviewing in January 2021.",

A movie with deep Emotion and Learning.A movie witch has best acting, script, screenplay, dialogues..... even I am searching words to describe this Bollywood Gem - \"Anand\".Rajesh Khanna the Dream Man of Girls stole everyone's heart. Amitabh Bachchan looks so decent and played a role of qualified doctor who wrote book about the a truly living charterer- Anand (Rajesh Khanna). Every star cast was selected so according to their role. Even if you change a single actor movie would loose its glory. Sumita Sanyal & Seema Rao the two Indian beauties were awesome in this movie. Johnny Walker, Dara Singh, Lalita Kumari played very important role.This movie shows how to live life even if things are not favorable. Anand sets example by his way of living. Relation between a Doctor and a Patient was perfectly described i this movie. A very simple movie. When I child I first saw this movie, and every character left impression on my mind forever. Even after watching Seema Rao as Mrs. Suman Kulkarni, I had a dream to get same kind of life partner, she was way awesome in this movie. The struggle of a doctor for his patient, that untold love, those undefined but yet the strongest relations, those dialogues every thing was Best.One Must See this Movie, if he/she wants to understand Indian Cinema and Life.",

I've heard this iconic line many times, but to actually listen to it, in the context of it's movie's storyline, was a different experience altogether.Anand (1971) is truly a cult classic movie. It has every element you'd expect from a cinematic masterpiece. From the dialogues to the acting, cinematography, music, direction and writing, everything was top notch. Amitabh Bachchan and especially, Rajesh Khanna nailed their respective roles. Tbh, i hadn't watched a single movie of Rajesh Khanna before this, so i didn't knew what to expect. Yeah i've heard people calling him a 'superstar'. But now, i kinda understand why. He perfectly knows how to carry a film on his own shoulders. His character was written very well, along with his dialogues. They were truly funny, hilarious and way ahead of their time imo.Other than that, there's something different you'd feel while watching this movie. It has a unique vibe. It's definitely not one of those typical bollywood movies of the 60s/70s. Finally, the ending was actually emotional, and the reason being that the character development is so good that you'll eventually develop a sort of attachment/bond with the protagonist (Anand, in this case), and therefore, start to feel for him. My eyes were legit in tears during his death scene.Overall, it's a must watch. It's an excellent movie in the drama genre, and is easily comparable to the hollywood movies of the 60s and 70s.",

If all of us sincerely agree to this point, life will be different and the world will see a resurgence of exhilaration.Excellent depiction of laughter which hurts your heart and of sadness which doesn't allow you to grieve is what makes this movie special.

(there is another story about how Kishore Kumar's security guard accidentally threw Mukherjee out of the gate mistaking him for another person that Kumar has asked him to stop from entering into the house.)\nResult was the ultimate combination of Amitabh Bachchan and Rajesh Khanna with later in the titular role.\nPeople love Rajesh Khanna in this film and some say it is his best performance. I don't agree to it. I think this is one of the great performance of any actor anywhere.\nBut solely Rajesh Khanna cannot be given the credit to this great film which several other great actors.\nThe contrast between the characters of Amitabh and Khanna was the highlight of the film while the Character of Ramesh Deo as middleman between the two gives you a sense of peace that at least there is one character that matches the real life character.\nThe screenplay by Gulzar is just terrific. There is not a single redundant scene and there is not a single character. Every character, even minor ones, who once appears on screen leaves his mark on the screen and has a significant importance int he pace of the story.\nThe songs by Salil Chaowdhary are the heart of the film and most of the songs are sung by Mukesh in his melodious voice.\nEverything in this film is timeless and it is a very rare combination when everything in the film works to its best.\nThis is faultless cinema.",

I wont reveal much since its a spoiler free review for those who havent seen the film i recommend this film strongly. Also i personally have huge soft corner for emotional cinema and everything from family to friends is blended pretty well in Anand. The scenes between Amitabh and Rajesh Khanna are wonderful. Rajesh Khanna brings us so close to Anand that we could'nt resist when in the climax Bacchan realises that he's no more. Rajesh Khanna is brilliant and brings us back to the chore of humane making us realise that basic approach of life towards the world is to be happy and make other people happy irrespective of the situation. He just nailed that role. Amitabh too as a no-nonsense doctor is brilliant act. Also other actors from big to smaller parts even johny walker leaves a lasting impression. The songs add to glory of Anand. The music, the dialogues, the drama and yes even comedy everything is blended beautifully in this wonderful movie that has a strong human message that connects everyone with the great dose of entertaiment. Anand is pacy and never feels manupulative and has a big and strong heart with great central performance. Watch it, that's what you call entertainment.",

He wants to live life to its full extent even when it is cut short by an ailment. He never blames anyone, instead he takes this time to teach others how to live life. He behaves in a manner that nothing has happened to him. He amazes his Doctor \"Babu mosai\" every time he talks to him and makes him spell bound that how anyone can be so live in the days that most of us would take as dark.

So he felt sad when alone in home and sings \"Kahin dur jab din dhal jaye\" imagining a dream that had never become a reality.

            "content": "I always wonder why we Indians keep raving about Hollywood movies being more superlative or transcendent than Indian ones, when we have given many timeless movies in the past 100 years. One such evergreen movie is Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Anand (1971) which upon its release stole millions of hearts and holds its legacy and class even today, after 40 years of its release.The movie is a classic story of a terminally ill man Anand Saigal, played by legendary actor Rajesh Khanaa who wishes to live his life to the fullest before the inevitable occurs, as prophesied by his best friend Dr. Bhaskar Banerjee, played by another legend Amitabh Bachchan and famously remembered as BabuMoshai. Anand's charisma and living each second to the fullest attitude leaves you in tears towards the film's climax.Anand raised the bar of Indian cinema with its brilliant story, screenplay, direction, dialogues and music.People who have knowledge of Indian cinema are very well aware of Hrishikesh Mukherjee who has his own panache of film-making. Anand was his masterpiece both in terms of technical domain of film-making (background music, screenplay) as well as in subsuming viewer's emotions. In Anand, he kept the story simple and focused more on potent dialogues and human's psyche of contemplating death. The movie, with its realistic sets and novel screenplay changed the face of Bollywood industry in 70s, when pure melancholy and melodrama were the ruling cards!Anand is one movie which should not be missed by a movie buff. If you haven't watched it yet, put all your works aside and witness this great cinema, which is far-far better than mindless commercial movies releasing in current times.",

Amitabh Bachchan played the perfect supporting actor role. The story, screenplay and direction by Hrishikesh Mukherjee for me, was undoubtedly the best by any Indian film director ever! What I liked about the film the most was the fact of how a terminally ill patient (Anand), knowing that the days in his life are limited, still enjoys every bit of it, and makes everyone surrounding him happy! The diversity shown by few supporting characters, like by the late Johnny Walker, who played the character of \"Muralilal\" was impressive! The songs were very deep in meaning and soothing. The best scene from the movie would be the death scene of Anand, played by Rajesh Khanna! 10 out of 10 stars, no doubt!",

Anand knows he will die. But still he lives life to fullest.The movie also shows no one can deny the inevitable things.At last, movie concludes with saying that a body may die, but soul never dies, maybe hishis deeds and activities will be missed forever but he will live in loved ones always forever. As babumoshai says \" Anand mujhe pata hai, ab tum mera hissa ban chuke ho, ab tum mere ander bhi jeevit ho, bas tumhari ye bak bak yaad aayegi \"\nAnd also \" Anand nahi marte \" Meaning his memories and learnings are here with us, always.The music and lyrics are so apt & perfect.Outstanding stuff, I must say.",

The brilliant Direction by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, the friendship between Anand(Rajesh Khanna) and Bhasker(Amitabh Bachan) is surely the attractive part of the movie.\nBut the most important that makes this movie the greatest is, the brilliantly written screenplay of the movie. Never have I come across a movie which has depicted the topic of dreaded Cancer Illness as the movie Anand. Without spoiling this movie. I just want to convey to any Cinephile belonging to any country in the world to just go watch it on Youtube. This movie is not a stereotypical Bollywood musical , this is a movie about Life !!!",

Amitabh with his splendid performance as a very serious doctor(writer), who is a cancer specialist and tries his best to save Anand but all in vain.The music of the movie is its another strongest part, Mukesh with his magical voice leaves a strong impact.

And when he has the support of a great actor by name Rajesh Khanna, one can look for wonders. Here the wonder element was provided Amitabh Bachchan, a 30-year old unsuccessful actor until then, suddenly realising his potential which was to transform itself later into 'the actor of the century'. The seeds for such bloom were sown in this beautifully made human story of a terminally ill cancer patient and his relationship with his doctor and other friends.

Finally, I gave it a trial.It does not have any action, any sci-fi miracle or any larger than life character. But if you will see Anand, you will realize that you do not often need a superpower to save other's life or to teach others to live life. Sometimes, the way you live your own teaches others everything.And those who believe in living life up to their fullest shall watch this.\ud83c\udf3bThis story revolves around a doctor turned into a writer(starring Amitabh Bachchan) whose story wins a Saraswati puraskaar. After being told to do so on stage, he narrates a story -ANAND.IMDb rating: 8.7\nAnand Sehgal(starring Rajesh Khanna), has been diagnosed with a disease in it's a terminal stage and is sent to Bombay by one of his doctor friends where he meets Dr. Bhaskar Bannerjee (starring Amitabh Bachchan) who is though an altruistic person but is hopelessly disinterested in life having witnessed malpractice of medical practitioners and poverty all across the nation. The first day itself when Anand meets Bhaskar, the latter is surprised by the former's will to live life. Even though, Anand is well aware of his disease-\"lymphosarcoma of intestine\", the terminal stage of cancer his desire to live the remaining days of his life does not vanishes. He also cracks jokes on his health condition while he says an iconic dialogue, which embarks huge respect for a person like him-\n\"Babumoshaai, Zindagi Badi Nahi, lambi honi chahiye!\"\n(meaning: Sir, life shouldn't be just long, but big enough.)\nThe way, the charm and the optimism with which this dialogue by Rajesh Khanna has been said, could make anyone believe in the existence of life and make anyone' vent to live life up to it's fullest.\nHe also further continues the same dialogue astonishing everyone in the room including Dr. Prakash Kulkarni(Ramesh Deo):\n\"Jab tak Zinda hun tab tak mara nahi, aur jab mar Gaya, saala mai hi Nahi!\"The movie, later on, revolves around various other scenes between Bhaskar and Anand where Anand teaches him about the way life should be lived. He not only makes that unemotional and hopeless person confess his love for the girl he has already been in love with but also makes a small space in the heart of every character in a movie.Anand's open-heartedness affects everyone. Even a matron in hospital(Lalita Pawar), who is very strict ends up liking Anand after she hears about his disease and yet him being so much alive, full of innocence and carefree.His carefreeness and naughtiness is illustrated when he innocently asks Sister Matron D'sa-\" Kya kabhi kabhi kayde kanoon tode nahi jaa sakte?\".Lalita Pawar has successfully prevailed in playing a role of caring matron who makes rule and strictly obliges everyone to follow hospital rules for the sake of good health and maintaining discipline.But the hospital's gloomy ambiance makes Anand run to Bhaskar's house.And when Bhaskar asks him the reason behind, hsays-\"Agar zinda rehna zaroori hai aadmi jahan hanske rahey, wahinAfter that when he meets Lalita Again where he builds an emotional bond with the strict matron.\nThere is a scene when Anand playfully says-\"Aapko sablog sister Kyun bullate hai, mother bulana chahhiye-mai mother matron bulaaunga.\" which melts the heart of every audience. Having heard, \"Ab dekhna kaise baandh ke rakhti hun.\" by the matron, Anand replies gracefully-\"Baandh k mujhe koi nahi rakh sakta mummy..theek nikal jaungaa!\"This scene really shows the way Anand is a free spirit who ought to live life on his own conditions even though his own life is betraying himself.Song: \"Kahin Door jab din dhal jaaye!\" is an emotional song shows that how you some time start appreciating the routine things overlooking the materialistic desires-which is overheard by Bhaskar and he realizes that even though Anand is playful and shares his happiness with the whole world, he never really makes anyone part of his sorrow.When Bhaskar asks him to share him the part of sorrow he abruptly stops in between of a dialogue-\"Toh kya har hasi k peeche bas khushi rehti h Babumoshaai, gum bhi toh...!\" which shows how cleverly he has been keeping all his secrets and pains away from the world and maintaining his smile teaching unconsciously to live and love their life as well.Anand is fond of making friends and wanted everyone to be his friend which introduces us to one of his weird though funny habit of patting any random person he meets on-road addressing him as Murarilal.After a number of pranks he meets Isa Bhai, one of the Murarilal's(starring Johny Walker)who ends up pranking with Anand too. Soon after they become friends Anand shows the zest to learn something new (acting) even when he is counting his last days. He later on also tends to make friendship with a girl who speaks only Gujarati with help of Isa Bhai.There is famous dialogue from here when Isa bhai shows him his acting skills.The movie touches all aspects of Indian society and beautifully encompasses both visibly and lyrically the emotional roller coaster that Anand went through all the while.Not only the scenes but songs like-\"Maine tere liye hi saat rang ke sapne chuney\" where Anand wishes good luck to his friend Dr. Kulkarni and his wife(Seema Deo) who later on becomes sister to Anand and also takes him to Moni baba(starring Brahm Bharadwaj)where Anand mesmerizes that monk too by his attitude and alive authenticity.\nAnand slowly makes the space in everyone's life, everyone including Ramu Kaka Bhaskar's maid who also wishes for the long life of Anand.Climax:\nAs the movie moves to it's ending, Anand's health deteriorates and finally he falls ill struggling for his life when well accomplished doctor like Bhaskar runs out frantically to a Homeopathy medicine hoping it will treat his cancer. Yes, Homeopathy medicine for treating terminal cancer. That's how much emotionally connected he got to Anand that he was willing to do anything. Bhaskar returns to find his friend dead. He starts shaking him to talk to him. And perhaps eerily, the room resonates with a dialogue which once Anand learnt from Isabhai and merrily imitated before Bhaskar-\"Zindagi aur maut toh uparwaley ke haath mein hai jahanpanah, jisey naa aap badal sakte hai naa main, hum sab toh rangmanch ki kathputliyaan hai, jiski dor upar wale ki unglion me bandhi hai-kaun, kab, kaise uthegaa..koi nahi btaa saktaa!\"And finally the movie ends with an emotional but legendary monologue- \"Anand marta nahi, anand maraa nahi karte!\"",
