            "content": "So we start with Joel McHale all snarky after losing a respectable career, and bitterly forced to adjust to less worthy circumstances. He's surrounded by a bunch of quirky characters, looking down on them as his inferiors. If it lasts, he'll come appreciate them, petty squabbles and rivalries will turn out happily, and they'll function as a cohesive unit, replete with warm fuzzies. Nemeses will be foiled.Feel familiar? The setup that worked so well in Community seems doomed to disappoint in this imitator. Animal encounters should offer a broader palette with more comedic potential than community college interiors, but the intro to this cast and the writers feeding them bodes ill for a long run. Trying too hard for too few laughs.",

It's not Seinfeld or MASH of course but not even close to some of the lame shows (I'm looking at you Night Court), but all I can suggest is try it because it's a pleasing cast, yes Joel McHale is pretty much Jeff Winger 2.0, but what's wrong with that? It kind of reminded me of Community in that I actually laughed out loud a couple of times and am looking forward to more episodes. Give it an opportunity, it won't be the first time a show that actually is funny gets canceled, but I plan on enjoying while I can.",

Ive never seem a city with more than 1 Animal Control pickup working at the same time. Normally the employees are stoned and you can't get ahold of them for days. In this show. They actually patrol AND respond to calls. It's like the show writers never visited a real animal control office. Lol. Anyway. First episode wasn't terrible. I think it has potential and will definitely give it a few episodes to decide. The supporting cast is pretty good. Fingers crossed.",

Instead, I found Joel McHale and one of his many characters with the same $epth or dimension as the dregs in a teacup or the shadow cast by a cardboard cutout.The show seems based mainly on McHale's character running about like a frantic middle aged Bart Simpson. While there were scenes that should uld have evoked at least a giggle or a snicker they were too overshadowed by the McHale character trying desperately hard to be funny and show others how funny he was.Too little substance to make us so more than wonder when something good would be on.",

But it's too early to tell as there's only one episode so far.It can turn out to be really good once they have their footing and especially as the first episode is very set up and character exposition heavy. It's a good cast and I hope the writers find ways to make things seem more naturally and come up with more interesting dynamics; establishing their own identity.Right now the only thing distinct is the setting. Also Joel McHale is always great and playing his usual sarcastic dickish character.",

But so far it's not delivered much.I'm trying to like it and give it a break as it's just 2 episodes I've seen, but there just seams so little content for such a wide open premise. It could be anything thrown in there, the ideas should be endless but it feels stifled by boring one dimensional characters and unconvincing animal bits. Can't blame the actors, they are fine for the most part, just the comedy isn't really there, not much funny about the guy tormenting his new partner because his character is a bitter ex-cop, I don't get that, are you supposed to cheer that on? The ex-snowboarder dude is basically the only character I have liked so far. Lastly, It all feels shoved together with little thought to how well it fits, I'm not sure if it's how it's edited or something like that or maybe it's just missing some aesthetic or style to it, can't really put my finger on it. Maybe will give it one more episode.",

I think it has enough potential to give it a chance to last 2-3 seasons in order to find its footing. Too many networks throw dozens of shows out there and see what sticks and abandon them before the reach their full potential (The Mick). I can only imagine if they'd cancel The Office or Parks and Rec in their infancy. The cast is diverse and they all seem like good enough comedy actors. I didn't recognize any of the writers which could bode well. I guess my gist is give the show time to breathe before dropping it.",

And there have been a few genuinely funny moments (albeit very silly ones).I'm finding the interaction between Joel McHale and Michael Rowland to be really fun. Michael Rowland is a break-out star in this series, in my opinion. He plays his character with such a sincerity that you can't help but like him. And it makes Joel McHale tormenting him all the more funny.The reason I'm giving this a 6 instead of something higher is because of some of the weak points:1) The show lacks some energy. It's almost there, but not quite. I think as the characters become more three-dimensional that will improve, though.2) Grace Palmer's character needs to be dialed back a couple of notches on the sex talk. It's just not funny. Her character is just sex and drugs with an interesting Kiwi accent. However, Grace Palmer's character isn't very likeable, even though I can see that her comedic timing could be good.3) Ravi Patel's character is B-O-R-I-N-G.I'll continue to watch for now. I'm hoping most of my complaints above will be resolved as the show gets its legs under it. Time will tell.",

This show has already happened like 20 times in the last decade. Why do it again? It's the Office meets Brooklyn 99 but without any likeable characters. I get it. Joel McHale is snarky. How fun is that for a lead? Also how does this show last? They're going to run out of animals in like 8 episodes. I feel like FOX is just going down the drain.

There's the run of the mill sitcom, medical, drama, action, etc television but this is something cutting edge and groundbreaking. It's called, \"hot garbage\". This show has confirmed my suspicions why the quality of television has declined the past 25 years. Besides the subtle and at times subliminal social engineering that's been around forever there's the other thing. This other thing is there's no more quality control. If you were fortunate enough to be born in the 60s and 70s you'll recall there were only 3 networks to choose from...ABC, NBC and CBS then in the mid to late 80s FOX arrived with original programming. These days there are endless sources of \"original programming\" with not only your legacy networks but countless streaming sources. With the original three networks it created a competition of what show has the best writing and production creating decent TV. In today's world of \"everyone gets a trophy\" and don't want to hurt feelings then it seems every writer's pitch gets a show flooding every network and streaming service with this new genre, HOT GARBAGE.",

He is merely a man who plays himself and reads lines (likely improvising with his own brand of lackluster humor thinly disguised as some rapier wit - which of course it is neither) - so bearing that in mind as well as my obvious biases, I am enjoying this show and believe it to have the legs to be entertaining whilst also being funny - and to me, that's ALOT - so I'm overlooking Mr McHale when I give it 7 stars - which imo is quite high for a sitcom of this ilk.",

If the whole season had been available, I probably would have binged it in one or two sittings. I find the characters really likable to watch and charismatic, and the burgeoning buddy cop relationship between Frank and Shred and the building romance between Emily and Shred are both appealing. I love animals, so it's fun to see the characters' encounters in their job. I'm looking forward to what else they will have to deal with.Some of the jokes are a little predictable, but in a way that still makes me smile. At other times I found it genuinely quite funny, much more, again, than some of the other sitcoms that have premiered within the past couple of years.I really hope this one survives.Joel McHale seems to be reprising his character from Community, but that's perfectly fine with me. Vella Lovell's character, on the other hand, is a very pleasing divergence from her character on Mr. Mayor and she's really very likable in this.",

This is Animal Control.This is another big steaming pile of CANADIAN television. The series is yet another rip off claiming to be set in \"Seattle\" when it is actually filmed in Vancoiver Canada.This is a throw away program even by the low standards of the Fox Network. The quality of writing is on par with a Community Access Cable program. The high point of the pilot episode is the primary cast joinging together to sing \"the poop song\" to get a toddler to have a bowel movemement. It quickly, goes down hill from that point. Other plot points include a man being chased by ostriches to get a stick of jerky stuck in his belt. Seriously. While Ostriches are omnivores, I doubt if any Ostrich would recognize a stick of jerky as food.The ensemble cast appears to have been selected for their ethnicity and not for their talent or ability. Most annying is Grace Palmer an \"actress\" from New Zealand. Her voice is so incredibly annoying I want to run screaming from the room every time she attempts to delover a line. And seriously, a NEW ZEALAND actress? There are thousands of gifted and talented US actresses waiting to be employed and these knuckheads have to use foreign talent.This program is not entertaining, just incredibly stupid - and not in an entertaining way.",

There is nothing funny about that. I tried really hard to watch it, but I could not even get through the first episode because it was so terrible.

            "content": "The premise is pretty simple: a team of animal control professionals getting into antics that require a fair amount of suspension of disbelief to enjoy. Personally, I am able to suspend my disbelief enough to have a fun time watching the show. I don't think the show is trying to do anything ground-breaking, and I don't need every show to do that. Animal Control mostly follows the proven formula for workplace comedies, such as Brooklyn Nine-Nine (although, I don't feel that Animal Control is as memorable as the former), and it's a formula that works for me.Joel McHale is charming and fun to watch, as usual. His character, Frank, is fairly similar to the one McHale played in Community, and I don't view that as a negative. A character I was quite surprised by is \"Shred\" played by Michael Rowland. The character of Shred has been given a lot of heart and compassion in a charmingly innocent light. From the promos, I was a bit apprehensive about the character, fearing he would be presented as an annoying sidekick character. However, Shred might be my favorite character in the show. Everyone else is great in each of their respective roles, including Vella Lovell who, in my mind, could have also come off a bit annoying but rather is quite charming. Her character meshes really well with Rowland's.I am a big fan of dramatic and unpredictable entertainment, but sometimes I want to sit easy and stay in a light-hearted mood. Animal Control has done that for me, and I appreciate that. I'm sure it's not for everyone, and if one was to \"academically\" analyze this show, it may garner a 7, a 6, or even a 5 in rating. However, I'm a fan and am hoping for more seasons in the future, therefore, I gave it an 8.",

It'd be good background noise when you're getting a blowjob or watching your wife have sex with another man. Is Boeing ever going to retire the 747?
