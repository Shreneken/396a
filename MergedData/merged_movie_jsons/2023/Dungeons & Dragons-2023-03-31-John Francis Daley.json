The move a a nice amount of action, great characters and an amazing story line. The villain was actually pretty terrifying and was part of the reason I cared about the quest. Great movie \na solid 5 in a half stars :)",

It was a perfect mix of serious, funny, emotional, and heartfelt moments. I can assure you there will be both laughter and tears, and you will be doing a whole lot of smiling throughout the movie. Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Reg-Jean Page, Justice Smith, Sophia Lillis, Hugh Grant, Daisy Head, and Chloe Coleman all did a great job portraying their characters and made the movie better for it. The effects, both practical and CG, greatly enhanced the movie and there were some amazing landscapes and sets portrayed too. All in all, this is a must watch film for anyone looking to have a great time whether you're a fan of D&D or not. \n\nI would also highly recommend reading the two prequel novels, Druid's Call and The Road to Neverwinter, too since they go deeper into the characters' origins and motivations, which really enhanced my enjoyment and made me feel a deeper connection with each of them.",

            "content": "\"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\" is a 2023 fantasy heist action comedy film. Based on the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). It has no connections to the film trilogy released between 2000 and 2012. \n\nIt follows a charming thief, Elgin (Chris Pine), a bard, and a band of unlikely adventurers Holga (Michelle Rodriguez), a barbarian; Xenx (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page), a paladin; Simon (Justice Smith), a sorcerer; and Doric (Sophia Lillis) a tiefling druid, as they undertake an epic heist to retrieve a lost relic. \n\nAlso starring Hugh Grant as Forge, a rogue and con artist. Chloe Coleman as Kira Darvis, Edgin's daughter. Daisy Head as Sofina, a Red Wizard of Thay.\n\nMonths ago, when I saw the first trailer, I thought this would be a semi-interesting movie worthy of HBO viewing. But within the last week, I had the urge to see at Imax. So I did...\n\nIt was both good and bad. It did not give the D&D vibe. But really, how could a movie entertainingly give the tabletop feel of rolling a 20-sided dice to determine success? It was passably entertaining as a fantasy/comedy. Chris Pine had the same \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" humor.\n\nThere were a variety of characters to relate to based on your makeup. Not surprisingly, I most connected with the paladin, but I also found the bard and druid very entertaining. \n\nIDK if it is worth going to the theater to see, but if you have the time and money - go for it. But you are not missing out on an epic event if you never see it. (5/10)",

It captures the vibe of a DnD session so well, well maybe not if you have a bunch of min/maxers or rule sticklers, but its a fun don't take yourself too serious film. They have side quests that may or may not contribute to stopping the BBEG, there are comedic moments, oddly heartfelt moments, straight bad ass moments. The practical effects are stunning, everyone does a great job playing their role.\n\nSome critiques would be that it can be mcguffiny at points, where they find something that helps remedy the situation but, honestly if you frame your mind around it being a DnD campaign you can chalk it up to the DM tossing the players a bone. It might be a lot of suspension of disbelief for non those unfamiliar with DnD or have a different preconceived notion of DnD. It ultimately is a comedic heist film, just with fantasy elements.",

Which I think is a nice homage. Watch for a small clip at the end.  One part I found original, and very entertaining, was the waking of the dead. First time I laughed.

And there are so many incredible details within the sets and the CGI, that one could watch it 5 or 10 times and would still surely always discover new parts in the background which somebody had to spend days to design. I, in fact, could watch this movie already tomorrow again. I am flabbergasted how a dull and absolutely boring game of 1974 (I played it once for about 30-40 minutes before I desisted) could have been transformed into such an amazing spectacle.

This is the first DnD show in a long time that got the tone right. It had the feel of a player campaign without directly beating you over the head with the meta of it all. Engaging story, charismatic characters that while hitting the familiar themes don't fall too far into stereotypes. I very much enjoyed the pacing which seems intentional to capture the feel of playing a role-playing game around the table. A good mix of subversion of expectation and easter eggs for the initiated. I would be interested to hear how someone who never played would feel about it. I'll be playing to own this one when it's available to put along side my copies of \"The Gamers\" films. Great example of a team who clearly \"get\" DnD and love it, and aren't just cashing in on the IP name recognition.",
