            "review_title": "Ozu's Quietly Brilliant Masterpiece Deserves Your Attention",
            "content": "I think this movie is amazing for reasons I was not expecting. I had heard of Yasujiro Ozu's \"Tokyo Story\" for several years but never had an opportunity to see it until Criterion resuscitated it as part of their DVD collection. Over fifty years old, this wondrous 1953 film resonates just as deeply today. Those outside Japan rarely get to see a Japanese film classic that doesn't involve samurai warriors in medieval battles. This one, however, is a subtly observed family drama set in post-WWII Japan, and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of Ozu's film-making style that makes this among the most moving of films.The plot centers on Shukishi and Tomi, an elderly couple, who traverse the country from their southern fishing village of Onomichi to visit their adult children, daughter Shige and son Koichi, in Tokyo. Leading their own busy lives, the children realize their obligation to entertain them and pack them off to Atami, a nearby resort targeted to weekend revelers. Returning to Tokyo unexpectedly, Tomi visits their kindly daughter-in-law, Noriko, the widow of second son Shoji, while Shukishi gets drunk with some old companions. The old couple realizes they have become a burden to their children and decide to return to Onomichi. They also have a younger daughter Kyoko, a schoolteacher who lives with them, and younger son Keizo works for the train company in Osaka. By now the children, except for Kyoko and the dutiful Noriko, have given up on their parents, even when Tomi takes ill in Osaka on the way back home. From this seemingly convoluted, trivial-sounding storyline, fraught with soap opera possibilities, Ozu has fashioned a heartfelt and ultimately ironic film that focuses on the details in people's lives rather than a single dramatic situation.What fascinates me about Ozu's idiosyncratic style is how he relies on insinuation to carry his story forward. In fact, some of the more critical events happen off-camera because Ozu's simple, penetrating observations of these characters' lives remain powerfully insightful without being contrived. Ozu scholar David Desser, who provides insightful commentary on the alternate audio track, explains this concept as \"narrative ellipses\", Ozu's singularly effective means of providing emotional continuity to a story without providing all the predictable detail in between. Ozu also positions his camera low throughout his film to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. It adds significantly to the humanity he evokes. There are no melodramatic confrontations among the characters, no masochistic showboating, and the dialogue is deceptively casual, as even the most off-hand remark bears weight into the story. The film condemns no one and its sense of inevitability carries with it only certain resigned sadness. What amazes me most is how the ending is so cathartic because the characters feel so real to me, not because there are manipulative plot developments, even death, which force me to feel for them.I just love the performances, as they have a neo-realism that makes them all the more affecting. Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama are wonderfully authentic as Shukishi and Tomi, perfectly conveying the resignation they feel about their lives and their children without slipping into cheap sentimentality. Higashiyama effortlessly displays the sunny demeanor of a grandmother, so when sadness does take over in her life, it becomes all the more haunting. In particular, she has a beautiful scene where Tomi looks forlornly at her grandchild wondering what he will be when he grows up and whether she will live to see what happens. Even more heartbreaking is the scene where Shukishi and Tomi sit in Ueno Park realizing their children have no time for them and are resigned to the fact that they need to find a place to sleep for the night. The closest the film has to a villain is Shige, portrayed fearlessly by Haruko Sugimura, who is able to show respect, pettiness and conniving in a realistically mercurial fashion. Watch her as she complains about the expensive cakes her husband bought for her parents (as she selfishly eats them herself) or how she finagles Koichi to co-finance the trip to Atami or how she shows her frustration when her parents come home early from the spa. So Yamamura (familiar to later Western audiences as Admiral Yamamoto in \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\") displays the right amount of indifference as Koichi, and Kyoko Kagawa has a few sharp lines toward the end of the film as the disappointed Kyoko.But the best performance comes from the legendary Setsuko Hara, a luminous actress whose beauty and sensitivity remind me of Olivia de Havilland during the same era. As Noriko, she is breathtaking in showing her character's modesty, her unforced generosity in spite of her downscale status and her constant smile as a mask for her pain. She has a number of deeply affecting moments, for instance, when Noriko explains to Shukishi and Tomi how she misses her husband, even though it is implied he was a brutalizing alcoholic; or the touching goodbye to Kyoko; or her pained embarrassment over the high esteem that Shukishi holds for her kindness. Don't expect fireworks or any shocking moments, just a powerfully emotional film in spite of its seemingly modest approach. The two-disc DVD set has the commentary from Desser on the first disc, as well as the trailer. On the second disc, there are two excellent documentaries. One is a comprehensive 1983, two-hour feature focused on Ozu's life and career, and the second is a 40-minute tribute from several international movie directors.",

            "review_title": "Universal appeal of Tokyo Story",
            "content": "As with every great work, the film has its own unique perfection in style, rhythm, details, and artist's vision - but Tokyo Story is very universal in its appeal - it is for every parent, every son or daughter - for everyone. It was made 50 years ago in Japan, about people who lived far away, but it is also about all of us, our families, our problems, our guilt and our search for love and meaning.Ozu's film does not require one to be a movie buff or to try to solve complex symbolism to appreciate and love it. It brings smiles because it is a comedy (for at least the first 2/3) and sadness with a high drama of the last 1/3 of the film.Yasujiro Ozu's quiet and deceptively simple film tells a story of an elderly couple who travel to Tokyo to see their grown up children and their families - son, daughter and daughter-in-law who is a widow of their middle son that was killed during the World War II. Their children love them, of course but they are too busy with their own lives and jobs to spend much time with them. Their young grandchildren don't know them and not too eager to try to know their grandparents better. Only the widowed daughter-in-law is the one who is really happy with their arrival and tries to make their visit pleasurable. After parents return home, children receive a telegram with the sad news that the mother became critically ill. Now it is their turn to make a journey.Ozu does not judge anybody, but beneath the quiet politeness, smiles, and soft voices there is a sad, inevitable, and powerful alienation of generations in the modern world of big cities. The simple family melodrama has been told with intensity, humanity, and honesty of character.P.S. The first thing I wanted to do after I finished watching this film was to pick up the phone and call my mom. Just to hear her voice.",

            "content": "I can vividly remember the first time i saw this movie - it was during a festival of Japanese movies in an art house cinema here in Dublin. I must admit to never having heard of Ozu before, i went out of boredom and casual curiosity. I was embarrassed at the end to find myself in tears. I quickly wiped them away in that subtle way guys do when they don't want anyone to know, and got out to leave. What struck me was that even as the credits were finishing, I was one of the first to go. As i walked up the aisle I realized that most of the nearly full cinema was still sitting quietly, without the usual post movie chatter - and more than half of the audience had tears pouring down their faces. I have never, ever witnessed that in a cinema.Since then, i've watched it on DVD, and had to think a lot about why such a simple movie is so powerful, and so many people rate it as one of the greatest ever. And why i find myself agreeing with that rating, i truly think it is in the top 10 ever made - certainly the top 5 of any I've seen. But its hard at first to know why. It doesn't have the greatest script of any movie, there are few things in it that are truly original. The acting is great, but not the greatest ever seen, and the technical qualities are just average. I've come to the conclusion that the reason for its greatness is that it comes closest to pure art in cinema. By pure art, i mean art that in its simplicity but technical genius still reveals deep truths about our lives. When i think about Tokyo Story I don't find myself comparing it to other movies, instead I think of a Rembrandt self portrait, a Vermeer painting, or my favourite short story, 'The Dead' by James Joyce. It is simple, unadorned, and deeply wise. I realise in writing this I'm rapidly approaching pseuds corner, but this is my genuine conclusion (writing as someone who is shamefully uneducated in most of the arts).Of course there have been many great movies about families, about growing old, about the nature of life.... but I think somehow Ozu achieved a sort of perfection with Tokyo Story. Thats why its the only movie I would give a '10' to.",

I loved the performances in this movie by simply everyone involved, as well as great directing and amazing writing. Although the movie is 2 h 15 min long and its a black and white \"old\" movie don't be fooled - this is a great movie that makes you think about your life and especially the people you love and that you have to love them while their are still here with you, because life is very short and better make most of it with the people you love.

            "review_title": "Things are the way that they are and it is perfect",
            "content": "Ozu's Tokyo Story is a serene and contemplative look at the breakdown in the relationship between grown children and their elderly parents shortly after World War II. The film concerns itself with problems many of us must face: the struggle to maintain a self-fulfilling life independent of parental expectations, the changes in relationships wrought by time, and the inevitability of separation and loss. Ozu does not point the finger at either parents or children but, like many of his films, offers a thoughtful meditation on the transitory nature of life.As the film opens, we see an empty street, empty train tracks and an empty pier, perhaps an early indicator of the sense of loss that pervades the film. An elderly father, Shukishi Hirayama (Chishu Ryu) and his wife Tomi (Chieko Higashiyama) are preparing to travel by train to visit their children in Tokyo. When they arrive, they are met with indifference by daughter Shige (Haruko Sugimura), their grandchildren Minoru (Zen Murase) and Isamu (Mitsuhiro Mori), and son Koichi (So Yamamura), a Tokyo pediatrician. When Koichi is called to visit a patient and Shige cannot leave her beauty salon, the Harayamas postpone a sightseeing trip and start to complain that they expected the children would be living in more comfortable circumstances. Their widowed daughter-in-law Noriko (Setsuko Hara), however, welcomes them warmly and gives them the experience of being appreciated.To give themselves some breathing room, the children pool their resources and send their parents to Atami, a health spa. Their visit, however, is cut short when the noise and crowds make going home seem like a better alternative. When they get back to Tokyo, Shige tells them she has a meeting scheduled at her house and Tomi decides to spend the night with Noriko. Shukishi, in a very humorous scene, goes out drinking with old friends and shows up late at night at Shige's house completely drunk. When the elderly parents return to Onomichi, the mother suddenly becomes very ill and the entire family, including youngest son Keizo from Osaka, must come and visit them. The moment of epiphany comes when the youngest daughter Kyoko (Kyoko Kagawa) asks Noriko whether or not life is disappointing. Her answer mirrors Ozu's concept of mono no aware, that we cannot avoid the sadness of life, but her beaming face tells us that things are just the way that they are and that it is perfect.",

            "content": "An appreciation of this movie may demand some understanding of Japanese culture. The Japanese are rather reserved, and were even more reserved back in the early 1950's, when this film is set. No embracing, even of parents, children, siblings; no dramatic histrionics; even a death scene in this movie is much quieter than a Westerner might expect.Consequently I can't really blame several reviewers here for calling this movie boring and slow-paced. But it is not at all slow-paced from a different cultural perspective. It just depends on what you're used to.If you do take the time to watch and try to understand it, you'll find an engrossing analysis of the dynamic of a middle-class family, the rift that grows up between generations, and of the many excuses we find ourselves making to justify our neglect for others, even those dearest to us. These themes are universal, but are couched in a postwar Japanese idiom, and so probably less accessible to the average Western viewer.I have wondered awhile about a speech at the end by Noriko, the widowed daughter-in-law, in which she denies that she's such a good person (though her actions in the movie indicate otherwise). I'm still not sure I understand her motives in saying this. For the most part, however, this movie will not leave you puzzled, but it may leave you a bit wiser, and a bit more reluctant to make those excuses.",

I don't know why that is, other than being behind with my movie watching due to studying, and I am still kicking myself because Tokyo Story was one of the best films I've seen in quite some time. I haven't seen enough of Yasujiro Ozu's work to judge him as an overall director, but seeing Tokyo Story it is very easy to see why anybody would consider it one of his finest achievements or him as a master film-maker. Tokyo Story is beautifully shot, everything looks homely and evocative and the shots, frame and cinematography are done to perfection. And Ozu directs very sensitively and assuredly, it is said that he specialised in middle-class family melodramas and I have no trouble believing that. The story is quiet and meditatively paced but never bored me, because every bit of writing, family scene and character was dealt with in such a poignant and intelligent manner. Tokyo Story is also helped by some truly wonderful acting. Setsuko Hara just epitomises gentle kindness, making us warm to Noriko easily, while Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama play their roles with nuanced and affecting dignity. In conclusion, a beautiful and deeply moving film in all respects. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

His use of cinematic space is incredible.  He breaks all sorts of conventions with his cinematography such as violating the axis of action. This gives the viewer the sense of a large, open, unrestricted world.Going with this realism, the characters seem real; not for a moment did I see the people on the screen as actors.

The movie tells the viewer so much about Japanese middle class life in the 1950s: eating and sleeping; mourning the war dead; clothes and home furnishings; spoiled kids; a doctor's office; a schoolroom; life in Tokyo and small towns; how family members talk to each other; old men's drinking habits; a resort hotel. But while we see all these details of a real time and place, we are constantly drawn into reflection on the meaning of human life and relationships. The reflection emerges effortlessly from the simple narrative and the specifics. The director never annoyingly tells us how to feel, he is not preaching and not drawing attention to himself. (There is none of that \"hey, I'm making a moving movie\" crud that you get in Hollywood treatment of these topics). He just lets the story unfold in a quiet, natural way. It's not for folks who only like \"action\" movies. I put \"action\" in quotes because this movie is about the real action in life--enjoying life, sharing it with others, facing the end of it.",

The younger generation (and by extension the \"new\" Japan) turns its back on the family from which it arose- because of selfishness, because of necessity, or because it's simply the way of the world. The movie provides no easy answers- its melancholy ambiguity is part of its charm. Whatever the case, Ozu delights in portraying the details of everyday life. The emotional resonances of this movie are extraordinary, and some shots (a child picking flowers, an old couple framed by the sea, a woman sitting forlornly at her work desk) are enough to give a sensitive film-goer the shivers. Despite the testimony of some critics, the film is not totally devoid of melodramatic elements (some stock characters and cloying musical motifs spring readily to mind), but the film is founded upon such an obvious love and respect for the importance of real-world interactions that it's hard not to be anything other than enthralled by it.",

            "content": "This film is commonly called one of the masterpieces of international film. Indeed, a well-known \"intro to film\" textbook uses it as a case study in notable film-making. But, as more than one reviewer so far has pointed out, 'Tokyo Story' is slow, obscure, and sometimes seemingly sterile. Understanding how a great classic could be seemingly soulless requires some study - of Japanese culture, as others have pointed out, of film technique, and of ourselves. Fortunately, that understanding more than fully repays itself, as is true of any great piece of art.I should begin by warning the first time viewer that the film is not in any familiar style. Other reviewers have mentioned the camera, the angles, the acting, the elision - I hardly need dwell on these. Those used to Hollywood films of almost any era will find 'Tokyo Story' odd and unsettling, just because the style is so different. And of course the culture is radically different. In this forum one can hardly even begin to discuss the way that Japanese fathers discuss their children amongst themselves, or the marriage culture of 1950s Japan. But I think the film is great even if one has no understanding of continuity editing, or post-war Japan, or a dozen other obscure topics. This is, after all, the central feature of great art: Even those of us who do not fully understand still realize, in some unspeakable way, that we are in the presence of something great.The most common accusations leveled against this film, oddly, assert alternatively that it is a cold, soulless exercise in technique or, on the other hand, that it is a soap opera, with no real substance. I think neither of those is true. There can be no question that it is easily seen as cold. Nothing really happens, by modern standards. It is merely a family that comes and goes and lives and dies. Of course, to those who accuse it of being a soap opera, that death is the foremost evidence of its manipulative guilt. But, for those who have seen it, recall the mother's stroke, or where Keizo is told to look one last time - would a soap opera elide such a supremely emotional scenes?No, 'Tokyo Story' is neither cold nor manipulative. Rather, it slowly brings you into a family that, while perhaps totally unlike your own, is at its base just the same. Then it allows those things to happen that must someday happen to all of us - growing up, moving away, and that unspeakable, inescapable end. It is not easy; it is not obvious; but it is not obscure, either. After it all, I can only tell you this: If you have lived long enough to know how it feels to leave your parents and only realize far too late, as it seems we all do, the value of what you have left behind, then 'Tokyo Story' will reward you perfectly. And these things - we all do these very things, so 'Tokyo Story' is universal, is Art.",

            "content": "SPOILERSUnfortunately, I'm from the If-It-Doesn't-Move,-Poke-It-With-A-Stick school of film criticism. No, I'm just kidding. I like a lot of slow-moving movies. No, Tokyo Story has problems up the wazoo. It's not that it's a bad movie, either. I actually liked it, marginally. 7/10, for sure. I do feel that it's vastly overrated - about as overrated as movies come. It's very often considered one of the ten best films ever made. Personally, I don't think Yasujiro Ozu gives human existence enough credit. Life is never this uninteresting, nor are people. I have lost family recently, and I could relate stories about funerals that have such enormous depth that they would blow this thing away.I've heard so much about the amazing restraint of Ozu's style that I really just have to question it. I have seen one other Ozu film - Bakushu is its Japanese name; I can't remember whether it's Late or Early Spring. It was boring, too, but interesting culturally. It really was stale, with almost no movement whatsoever. Tokyo Story is clearly Ozu's most famous film, and, I have to say, the style here is not restrained at all. There are only two tracking shots in the whole film - that's what people usually point to when they're looking for stylistic techniques to point out. One person I've talked to said: \"In Tokyo Story, there's only one tracking shot [sic], and it cuts like a knife.\" I'd say that the one he's talking about does add to the poignancy a little, and so does the one he forgot. It didn't, however, affect me greatly. In fact, only a couple of individual shots touched me at all. As for the rest of Ozu, he does position his camera lower to the ground than probably any other director - a technique that isn't really very noticeable. Otherwise, it's not too much different from Hollywood. In fact, most Hollywood films of the era have limited or no tracking shots just based on their budgets. The editing patterns are almost identical to anything you'd find anywhere else, except for this odd and annoying type of cross-cutting that pops up whenever two people converse. I don't get that; it's really choppy, rather jarring for a movie that seems to want to be so realistic.And that's where I think this film's critical prominence lies, in its realism. I don't understand it, but whenever any film tries to be realistic or naturalistic, critics and most film buffs develop a raging erection. I know what real life is like, and I'd much rather see it exaggerated. To tell you the truth, as I said above, I don't think Ozu is presenting real life in Tokyo Story (or Bakushu). Real life has much more drama than this film. This is doing the opposite of hyperbolizing; it's minimizing real life. In real life, when a family meets around the dinner table, as the family does at the end of this film, there're a million circumstances effecting the outcome of that meal. Not so in this film. Ozu reduces them to types: the nice old couple, the too-busy adults, the selfish wife, the compassionate widow, etc. They do have character. I wouldn't want to undermine that too much. But in real life, they'd be so much more complex and interesting. I suggest that you attend a relative stranger's Christmas dinner, as a ghost, if necessary. It would be infinitely more complex.I do have to give the film credit for the complex issues that it raises. Its main themes have to deal with the callousness of the adult generation, and the disappointment in the elderly generation. It deals with these themes well whenever it gets around to dealing with them. A more brilliant writer would have had more with the grandchildren, but Ozu is content to have just a bit of it at the beginning. But, really, what does he bring out in the film that you didn't know already? I have a feeling that the same people who love this movie are right at the moment as I write this (12/19/2001) apprehensive about their parents or in-laws showing up for Christmas, and will breathe a sigh of relief when they leave. And I bet those same people will watch this movie when they're older and say, \"Hey, my kids are just like those a**holes!\"There are better movies about aging out there. Check out the Icelandic film Children of Nature, about an old man whose family is so annoyed at his presence in their home that they quickly move him to a nursing home, where he meets his high school sweetheart. They had been forced out of their homes in a more inhospitable part of the island years before, and together they conspire to go back there and die. Tokyo Story fans will certainly hate it, for the mere fact that it is, well, entertaining and fantastical. Another one I like a lot is by the Ozu-enthusiast's greatest enemy - the dreaded Akira Kurosawa, who often delivered amusing quips against Ozu when he was interviewed by the press; he thought Ozu was a bore, too. The film is Rhapsody in August, and I can hear the laughter already from the Ozu sector. I promise you all that that film will become more beloved and important as the years go on. Right now, it is in critical limbo for the silliest reason: Richard Gere is in the movie for about 15 minute. And it's actually one of his best performances, if you'd just give him a chance. That film is much better in dealing with the paradoxes of the three generations's relationships.",

Yes, everything is minimalist, with the shots straight on into the rooms the scenes are set in, everything is filmed without any camera movement and at knee height and between scenes director Ozu films scenery and inanimate objects to reveal heaven knows what.Putting all this genius to one side and despite the difficulty in squaring up to the very Japanese notions of behaviour and culture that seem perhaps slightly alien - everyone talks like robots, I found all this getting very much under my skin. The script seems to hit the difficulties of parents and children growing sadly but inevitably apart very accurately and the last 30 minutes or so are really quite touching particularly when the father thanks his daughter in law for her help. I'm sure this is a genuine masterpiece for many, but for me it was just a sweet, well told tale of parents and children. Forget it's greatness and just enjoy.",

The story shows how the children, preoccupied with their daily lives, do not show enough care for their parents, as opposed to the former daughter-whose husband died in the war. At first glance, everything in this film seems simple and clear, but on the other hand is a sensitive topic and family discord, somewhat generational conflict with fairly deep emotions without excessive melodrama.Staff are interesting, a little strange, however, show sincere emotion without many words. Of course, you need to understand Japanese culture, which I somehow fascinated. The story can be identified three generations of which is the oldest in a harmonious relationship. Although it can be concluded that it is not always the case. The younger do not have time for yourself and not for others.Most people do not live. Survive. Understanding and tranquility in fact represent the fund in relation to the sentiment and satire. People consciously or unconsciously influence the lives of others. People woven in one's life are there, even when they are not physically present.Setsuko Hara as Noriko Hirayama really is a beauty.

            "content": "I was shown Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story- my first Ozu film- in an Art-film class some years ago, and I watched it again a couple of months ago. This has to be a truly indelible Japanese film, even to those who might dismiss it dimly as 'slow' or one where nothing happens. Actually, if you're going by traditional plot, not a lot does happen. But then again, not a lot happens on Seinfeld, either. In fact, maybe on repeat viewings, this could become the serene, Japanese tragic-comic equivalent of Seinfeld. After two viewings I get the 'jist' of the characters, their simple objectives and how they live their lives, but there's still much that can be taken in, it's hard to describe. While I'm not sure I've seen one of the ten best films ever made, as it has been for some critics and audiences, I do think it's a very unique film, one that moves in a way akin to an Italian neo-realist film, but filmed with a very particular eye that sets it apart from them.In terms of how its characters go about in the story, it is really closer to a work of De Sica or other, as it is centrally about the importance of family, and how a family and its members through the petty parts and especially through the tragic times has to stick together. The family unit here involves a couple of grandparents (Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama, who have those funny, dependent, though truthful ways about them as elders of the common ilk) who come to visit the rest of their family, and aside from (more than any other) daughter-in-law Noriko (played in such a wonderfully every-day, compassionate way by the great Setsuko Hara), they're dealt with the 'it's the old folks again'. This is particular by their own real daughter, who seems most ungrateful for their arrival. They send them to a resort, but then something un-expected happens, which turns the situation around and ground the henpecking to an immediate halt.Some scenes still stick in my head even when I least expect them going about my days, much as the aforementioned Seinfeld episodes seem to do. I loved the gentleness in one scene where Noriko is offered a gift by the grandmother, it rings perfectly true to the everyday, but it's handled in such a way that could not have been done as well in another film. There's also a great deal of humility, with moments of amusement, when two male characters (one of them the grandfather I believe) get drunk. And throughout the film, Ozu creates impressionable compositions, setting him apart with just this film alone for me as a remarkable artist; I still remember certain shots of the houses and scapes (his specific way of shooting characters in the interiors is really neat too). In the class our teacher told us this was part of what were called 'handkerchief films' or something close to that in Japan, where audiences would bring hander-chiefs with them from crying so much during the film. I can see why; probably the best that can be said of Tokyo Story is how he pulls so much out of so little, and the interest that is always constant, even through little domestic squabble scenes, quiet moments with the elders (the old man has a look that's perfect throughout), and the more intense ones later on. In short, it's definitely at least one of the very best Japanese films of the 1950s, in the same rank as Kurosawa's best films.",

            "review_title": "Honor thy father and thy mother",
            "content": "\"Tradition is the illusion of permanence.\" - Woody AllenYasujiro Ozu's \"Tokyo Story\" finds an elderly Japanese couple visiting their adult children in Tokyo city. They intend to spend time with their offspring, but the kids are too engulfed in their own lives to make much time for their mother and father.Having seemingly lost the ability to relate to their parents, the self-absorbed kids thus shuttle the couple off to a luxury spa and hotel, all the while resenting their parents for the expense. Even the couple's grandchildren treat them with a great deal of scorn. The eldest grandson grows angry when he learns that he has to share his study with his grandparents and later throws a tantrum when the family cancels plans to visit a restaurant.Ignored by their family, the elderly couple wander about Tokyo city, visiting friends and soaking up the scenery. They receive more affection from strangers, old friends and the wife of one of their dead sons, than they do from blood relatives. The film ends with the family's frail mother predictably dying. Though her children take a few moments to mourn her loss, stating that they regret not treating their mother better whilst she lived, they promptly return to their old selves, their dead mother quickly forgotten.So what we have here is a simple morality tale. Ozu is a traditionalist, and the majority of his films view with bittersweet sadness how the traditional family unit has disintegrated in an increasingly urbanized post-war Japan. And yet, while Ozu waxes nostalgically for some ideal familial bond, his films are also about the \"inevitability of change\". One need only look at the titles of Ozu's better known films (Early Spring, Late Spring, Early Autumn and Late Autumn) to see that he's attached to a very specific form of Japanese seasonality. In \"Tokyo Story\" he makes this point quite literally when he has one character state that all families unavoidably drift apart, pulled in their own individual directions. The result is that \"Tokyo Story\" has an oddly counterproductive tone, Ozu both acknowledging the inevitability of change and mourning the loss of some idealized good old days. Typical of Ozu, the director's camera is always distant, austere and motionless. He doesn't sledge hammer his points and maintains a very remote tone throughout. This has led to critics and fans applying buzzwords like \"un-sentimental\" and \"restrained\" to \"Tokyo Story\". But is the film really \"restrained\", or is Ozu's emotionally inert quietness fooling us into thinking we're watching something of depth and complexity?Consider, for example, a scene in which the daughter pokes fun at her mother's weight, only for the mother to die at the end of the film. Instead of delving into the couple's relationship, Ozu opts for simple button pushing, forcing us into the easy position of hating the daughter and pitying the mother. Ozu's aloof style therefore disguises the shallowness of his material, whilst also denying us the satisfaction of what is really shameless domestic melodrama.Like Dreyer, Ozu thus has a tendency of packaging very sentimental and simplistic morality lessons in what can at times be a very challenging aesthetic. In other words, \"Tokyo Story\" is more challenging stylistically, than it is intellectually, morally, or emotionally. It is neither complex nor nuanced, its solemn style completely at odds with what is really a very easy and agreeable lesson.Still, it's not all black and white. If the sons and daughters don't have time for their parents its only because they are genuinely busy. Ozu even makes one son a hectic doctor in an attempt to absolve the boy of all guilt. Afterall, how can we hate a kid for cancelling a diner date with his parents when he's absent only because he's out saving lives?The waters are muddied further when late in the film the father reveals that he is disappointed that his children are not more successful. It gradually becomes clear that he has relied on the success of his children to validate his own life. Throw in the fact that the mother is a bit of an airhead, the father was once a drunk and that both parent's constantly put on a ridiculous facade of kindness, and it's hard not to empathise with their offspring. The kid's may be dismissive of their parents, but the parents, we learn, are equally dismissive of them.7.9/10 \u2013 An influential film, viewed as a masterpiece by many. Still, peel back its uptight stoicism and \"Tokyo Story\" reveals itself to be a pretty condescending message movie. Much of Ozu's filmography is like this, hiding sentimentality behind an austere aesthetic. Consider all the pavlovian heart attacks and wistfulness in \"End of Summer\", his sentimentalizing of the unemployed in \"Tokyo Chorus\", his fondness for abandoned, kindly old parents (Tokyo Story, Late Spring), the way he scorns (and celebrates!) modernisation (Good Morning) and mourns the way time rips all children away from the elderly (Late Autumn).

            "review_title": "A few observations",
            "content": "(some spoilers)Why would anyone want to write anything about a film released half a century ago? There are two most obvious reasons: (a) the author has only recently seen it and (b) the film is timeless, just as relevant today as when it was first released. In this case, it is both.Over the last half-century, Tokyo Story has found its way into the top ten list of numerous film critics. Much have been said about the reason why. What I'm trying to do here is just to make several observations, about things in this film that particularly strike me.One is on the scene at the Tokyo train terminal, when the old couple returns home after their visit in Tokyo. Most of us in today's world would have plenty of experience is saying farewell. Less of us would have experience in saying farewell to people whom we just may not see again. Still less of us (only those who have been around long enough) would have experience in saying farewell to people who expect that they may not see us again. Those of us in this last category would probably sense what I am referring to about the scene. The old women, in a completely matter-of-course manner, said to her children that now that they have had this reunion, if anything happens afterwards, they need not come (to the small town where the old couple lives). So plainly delivered, this line is one of the things that make Tokyo Story stand above other films with similar situations and similar dialogues.Another is a very haunting static image. Leading towards it is the part when the old couple's son, a very busy medical doctor, scraps the plan of a family outing. While the somewhat rebellious older grandson sulks, the grandmother successfully coaxes the younger son to go outside to play in a somewhat desolate industrial area. The grandmother, somewhat predictably, asks the little guy what he wants to do when he grows up, and equally predictably, the question is beyond his grasp, as he continues to pluck at the tall grasses. Then comes this last shot of the sequence, a distant shot of old on the right side of the screen and the young on the left. Regardless of what message you get out of this shot, the image is haunting.",

            "content": "This was my introduction to Ozu, and I have to say that I thought it was at times unbearably sad, and all the more so because of its misleading simplicity.In \"Tokyo Story,\" a mother and father make a trip to Tokyo to visit their three children and their children's families. Time, distance, and the children's busy lives have caused them to drift away from their parents; the mother and father learn that their children have become different people from those they used to know, and must face the uneasy conclusion that they may not like the people they have become.Ozu has created a prototype for cinematic minimalism. The camera hardly ever moves; static shots are edited together to give the movie whatever momentum it has. This style can become admittedly frustrating; I found myself fidgeting more than once. However, it also helps give images a more profound impact than they might otherwise have, because there are few distractions. As a result, a simple shot from behind of two old people sitting on the edge of a wall watching the sea in silence becomes achingly beautiful. Ozu is able to communicate their feelings of loneliness, regret and obsoleteness without a word or strain of music. He takes the exact opposite approach from that of a filmmaker like Steven Spielberg, and it works beautifully.And the movie is not as simple as it appears. For underneath the story about this one family and its dynamics, there is a larger story about the changes taking place in a post-war Tokyo, and the increasing divide between generations. Shot after shot of factory chimneys, power lines, and construction sites serve to both highlight the progress of a city about to take off and the inevitability of certain traditions being left behind.You will have to have patience with this movie, I won't lie to you about that. But I found that its subtle and haunting effects stayed with me for days after I had seen it.Grade: A",

            "content": "The omission of Ozu's oeuvre is definitely an unerring embarrassment for any movie aficionado, thankfully TOKYO STORY comes to my rescue, presumably Ozu's most renowned work, tellingly it merits all kudos it gets, gracefully scrutinizing the post-WWII mental disposition of Japanese people, and quietly tear-jerking in eliciting recollections and rumination between parents and their children. Parenthood is not for everyone, but we all have parents, we forever hold a sense of regret towards them, especially in the oriental culture, filial piety is the foremost virtue to measure an individual's worth, at least viewed by other family members.Ozu's camera stands or stays in a perpetual static angle, aka. the now famous \"tatami-mat\" shot, collectedly watches the motions of its objects, the Hirayama family, Shukichi (Ry\u00fb) and Tomi (Higashiyama) is an elderly couple living in Onomichi, taken care by their youngest unwed daughter Ky\u00f6ko (Kagawa), as the film starts, they set about visiting Tokyo for the very first time, to stay with their grown-up children there, it is a big deal for them, nevertheless, when sojourning in with their eldest son K\u00f6ichi (Yamamura) and eldest daughter Shige (Sugimura), the couple find themselves become a nuisance towards their families and their busy business, only Noriko (Hara), the wife of their deceased second son (who died in the war 8 years ago), treats them sincerely, brings them to sightseeing, hosts them in her small single apartment. After being sent to Atami for a hot spring spa which turns out to be too rowdy for the elderly, they decide to cut their trip short and return home. However Tomi falls ill on the train, so they have a layover in Osaka, where they meet their youngest son Keiz\u00f6 (\u00d4saka), when they reach home, Tomi's illness deteriorates, all the children head back and Tomi passes away shortly. The story can be derived from every ordinary family, the common dilemma is when we grow up, parents are slowly slipping from our priority list, for the successful ones, K\u00f6ichi is a neighborhood doctor, Shige opens a beauty salon, they are both married and the former has two young children, but they could not spare one day to spend with their parents, either swamped by urgent appointments or find it hard to close her business even for one day. It is a quotidian trepidation can happen in the much-urbanized city, but Shukichi and Tomi take it lightly, in their simple-minded, you can sense their disappointment, but all they do is enduring it calmly, claim that it is a natural course when children grow up, parents should not be in the way of their lives, beyond all the offhand pleasantries and formal proprieties, the bond of blood relations is sharply lopsided, one cannot help but interpreting it as a faddish mindset of Japanese at that time, but, over 60 years has passed, the film is still distressing to watch as our world barely changes into a better one. Ozu never married in his entire life, so overtly he had been defying this detrimental malady all his life, in the film, Noriko is a sheer opposite of Hirayama's self-seeking offspring (bar Ky\u00f6ko), it testifies that blood doesn't mean anything at all, which is a lightning bolt to those who deems bloodline as their purest and ultimate legacy in this world.Performances are uniformly high-end, Ry\u00fb radiates with utter aplomb and understanding although it is against his own age to act as a sexagenarian (he was in his early 40s then); Higashiyama calls forth great compassion in audience for her simple and unadorned charisma, Yammer and Sugimura superbly represents two very different kinds of self- obsession, the former is more depicted in a way of thoughtlessness whereas the latter parades her self-pleasing philosophy reeking with a whiff of opportunistic shallowness, but if one observes carefully, the more spiteful one is the former, more than often he awaits the latter to broach on some ill-considered remarks or ideas and then echoes with a genial smile.The most emotive of all comes from Hara, she is the exemplar of a golden-hearted soul, through her Noriko, Ozu consummately sheds light on the true, the good and the beautiful essence of human nature, Hara has a magnetic affinity on screen, which facilitates herself as one of the most indelible and iconic goddess in the Japanese cinema, now at the age of 95 and let us truly hope she will always stay with us with good health and longevity.",

            "content": "I first watched Tokyo Story in a classroom some time ago and witnessed something curious. I have never seen a group of people so choked up over a film, ever. The most curious thing about it though is that most could not place what exactly made them so emotional. There are moments in Tokyo Story in which you are hit with a wall of emotions, surprised and overwhelmed that this simple little film could evoke such feelings. It's something about the characters, the honesty, the way everything hits home despite the cultural and time-period barriers.Tokyo Story takes a deep look at familial relations in postwar Japan. Simply, it boils down to this: two aging parents (played by Ryu Chishu and Higashiyama Chieko) live far away from their children, who are in a quickly modernizing Tokyo. The children in Tokyo are quite selfish and focused on their own busy lives in the hustle-and-bustle of the city. The key character in this film, though, is Noriko (Hara Setsuko), the widow of one of the parents' sons who died in the war. Noriko turns out to be more active with her husband's parents than their own children are.The parents decide to make their first, and possibly final, trip to Tokyo in order to see their children and view the spectacle of the city. The only person that can make significant time for them, however, is Noriko; the children are busy with work and even send their parents away to a spa! In one heartfelt scene, the mother, Tomi, spends the night at Noriko's in which she begs her to re-marry and apologizes for the burden that her son has caused. During this time, the father, Shukichi, is out drinking with old friends and admits to them that he is disappointed with his children, agreeing with his friends who feel the same way.Ozu Yasujiro is considered to be one of the world's greatest filmmakers and Tokyo Story is considered his masterpiece. There is no reason to deny this. Ozu's camera is often a topic of discussion\u2013it usually sets itself at the level of people sitting on the floor (tatami), which allows the viewer to feel like they are sitting right with the characters. It is usually always a calm camera, and very rarely pans. His films are also often slowly paced and meditative, choosing to avoid showing important events which later are revealed through dialogue. Ozu's direction of children has always been brilliant, they are never a weak point in his films and he often bases his stories on child characters (though not here).Tokyo Story contains all of the elements that make Ozu's films popular with film students and cinephiles today. His calm, observant camera; his real-life, non-embellished characters; his attention to detail and the emotional emphasis on certain objects; his perfectly timed music; among other things, contribute ultimately to the warmth and effectiveness of the film. Ozu's passion for filmmaking knew no bounds.Tokyo Story will not appeal to everybody, especially today. The typical moviegoer will either dismiss the film because it is \"old\" or \"black and white,\" or find it boring. To the cautious and attentive viewers who allow themselves to connect with the characters and feel the story, Tokyo Story is a rewarding experience. Tokyo Story, along with Ozu's other films, is a good example of film as an art. Aimed at telling a story and depicting true life on camera, it is much less of the \"entertainment\" experience that people have come to expect from the movies today. There are no explosions, violence, chase scenes, or over- the-top characters here. This is Ozu. This is one of the greatest films ever made.",

This dynamic plays out at a glacial pace. About a third of the way through the movie I came to believe it would be entirely plot less, and while it's not quite that, it is definitely got a lot more \"Tokyo\" in it than \"Story.\"While the old people are very genial and pleasant, I didn't find their \"story\" that interesting. The movie did become more engrossing and affecting in its final third, but not enough to make up for the tedium of the first two thirds.The main reason I watched this movie was to see the brilliant Setsuko Hara, whose mesmerizing performance in Late Spring (also directed by Ozu) was most of the reason to watch it. She's very good here, but she's also got a pretty small part, which was very disappointing to me.Having seen two Ozu \"classics\" I'm thinking he's one of these highly admired film directors, like Godard or Jarmusch, whose appeal I find puzzling.Tokyo Story has been ranked by some as the greatest film ever made, but in a world of films like Rashomon, The Third Man, Citizen Kane, and Spirited Away, it's a label I cannot understand being placed on this particular movie.",

Far from being in the pantheon of greatest films, I found it to be a ploddingly dull movie that made some fairly obvious points about the weakening of the parent/child relationship as the parents settle into old age.The movie is definitely not without its fine points. The acting is generally excellent and the last half hour becomes increasingly interesting after the first brutally slow-paced opening hour and forty-five minutes. It's entirely possible that if Site & Sound hadn't placed this film on such a high pedestal, I might have enjoyed it more than I did. But then again, if they hadn't have rated it so highly, I might have never seen it at all.In the final analysis, \"Tokyo Story\" is worth a look but if you're expecting to see one of the greatest films ever made, be ready to be disappointed.",

            "content": "Labelling something 'the best ever' or even a more moderated 'one of the best...' is surely asking for trouble? But in the case of TOKYO STORY it would be difficult to imagine the film causing any kind of trouble at all as this very measured, courteous movie is such an inoffensive and charming offering. However it's not, in my view, anything remotely like 'the best ever'. It's a nice little film, in it's way, but I do wonder why on earth it has developed such a huge reputation? It's sad, it's endearing, it's sometimes rather beautiful and it's melancholic almost throughout, but it's also very predictable;nothing remotely unexpected happens, one can see things being flagged up well in advance. It's very slow and made in a very tightly confined way which hasn't really influenced subsequent movies half as much as some people would like to think.So what makes it considered \"one of the best\"? It's not the story which is spare and not very entertaining in itself,although the character development is good. We do get to know the people involved even if many a motive seems to remain mysterious at the end. It's not the camera work which is rigidly static, creating the impression of interlinked paintings through which the protagonists wander, rather carefully. The familiar Ozu stylisations; the low set camera, the unfamiliar looks almost straight-to-camera when speaking, make it a slightly unsettling film to watch initially, although one soon becomes used to them. Perhaps it's the location work, which is appealing,in a reserved and understated way? Japan in the mid 50s seems far more exotic and unfamiliar than it would today , but that's true of almost any developed country. Twenty first century England no longer resembles the country depicted in Ealing Comedies of the same era. And the acting is a conundrum. Cultural differences in speech patterns and body language make it hard to compare what we see here with what we are familiar with in the western world. Certainly the father-figure seems to move and speak in such a painfully slow and deliberate way (except when drunk!) that one really begins to wonder how naturalistic his acting is. Are we seeing something comparable to Brando's 'method' or to Olivier's Shakespearian style? I think one needs to be very familiar with Japanese language and culture to fully understand and appreciate that aspect. He's a nice old boy but he might well be a terrible actor. It's certainly not the music that makes this film special as it's neither evocative nor memorable, so I'm at a loss. CITIZEN KANE, which often shares this most elevated of critical pedestals with TOKYO STORY, clearly has cast a muchlonger shadow over the development of cinema and while it's chock-full of innovative moments and methods TOKYO STORY seems rather a stylistic cul- de-sac from which one can find very little in subsequent movies. It's not a bad movie, but it is one which I'd fine it hard to sit through a second time.",

The images he produces and the very minimalist camera work creates a rhythm that sucks the viewer in and slowly opens him/her up for the sad but essential ending of this movie.Ozu never tries to impose his story to the viewer. It looks like he follows his actors very disciplined and calm. This very structured and clear camera-work will alienate many modern moviegoers who are used to much more dynamic images.

A distinctive camera style is used, in which the camera height is low and almost never moves; film critic Roger Ebert notes that the camera moves once in the film, which is \"more than usual\" for an Ozu film.This is a very beautiful film, and the title is perfect, as it captures the city of Tokyo in all its 1950s beauty. From the point of view of Americans, this is especially fascinating, as it is less than a decade after Japan was our primary target. Look at all the beauty we could have destroyed.",

If Ozu had been a mathematician, I suspect he would have understood this idea. I have seen five Ozu movies and they all seem to be variations on a theme, that theme being an examination of the family dynamics of a particular Japanese family, frequently highlighting the frictions between generations and concerns about parents marrying off their daughters.\"Tokyo Story\" is my favorite of the Ozu movies I have seen and it is prototypical. All the techniques are here: meticulously framing each shot, shooting from a low level, using only direct cuts, minimizing camera movement, jumping ahead in time. The story has an aging Japanese couple traveling from Onomichi to Tokyo to visit their children, after a lapse of eighteen years. When in Tokyo the parents find that their children are busy with their own lives and are not terribly excited about the visit. The only person to receive them with much affection is the widow of a son lost in the war. This movie could easily be updated to the current time.The story is simply told, but it did require my attention. It took me a while to sort out the relationships between the son and daughter in Tokyo and their spouses and the single daughter-in-law. And sometimes the jumps in time were a little disorienting. For example, when the parents arrive in Tokyo a visit to a son in Osaka along the way is referenced, but scenes from that visit were not shown.I would have thought that the movie's having been made only eight years after the war, and only a year or two after the allied occupation of Japan, that there would have been more references to the war, but clearly Ozu was not out to provide much direct post-war analysis in this movie. He did treat the audience to a brief bus trip through Tokyo. The city then seemed already well on its way to becoming the modern city it is today.This movie is so skillfully shot in black and white that I was surprised to see in some of the later Ozu movies that he has an artist's eye for color.Some of the scenes in \"Tokyo Story\" will stay with me, like the scene of the parents sitting on the sea wall and discussing their decision to go home, basically admitting that the trip had been somewhat of a failure.Know that if you like this movie, there are a lot more Ozus like it.",

If you are into that sort of thing, you will love it. + The grandparents are very cute and nice people. You just want them to be your grandparents. + Unique cinematography. The camera is always at a low height, and almost never moves. It feels like you are there with the characters, sitting in the next room on a tatami.Weaknesses:This is not a great drama...there is not enough conflict, character development, dialogues, and even less turns in the story. I didn't find the characters layered. What you see from them in the first 20-30 minutes of the movie is pretty much what will get form them later on. It becomes kinda predictable. The cinematography is unique, and interesting at first (just ask any film snob), but its not enough to carry a movie. This is not 2001: A Space Odyssey.Conclusion: Ask any snob, they will tell you, this is one of the best films ever. Its not only touching, deep and well made, but its also Japanese, more than 50 years old, black-n-white, sloooow, and not popular with the masses, because apparently, these things count as positive. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with Japanese (Kurosawa), slow (Stalker, 2001) movies, or movies that are confined to a few interior places (12 Angry Men). And I think this is a very good movie. It just doesn't have enough content other than its mood, to hold up as well as some other old classics.Still, I say, give it a watch.

            "content": "The usual write-ups about Ozu focus on aesthetics and thematizing, let's try here to find the transcendent flow where these things, themes and aesthetics, are unified in the transitory experience of watching.Ozu sets an unmoving eye, this has been a frequent trope since his time, elaborated in many directions. With Ozu however the idea is simple in its original Buddhist context, capture life without passions, not letting us stray in whirls but creating instead, in the canvas, duration and time. He had already mastered this, more so in other films than here. The mastery is not that the camera occupies a certain position or frames a certain geometry, it is not an aesthetic quality. The most evocative Ozu shots for me are shots of a bar sign against the sky or blinds against a window, the shots are kept just long enough for the blinds to flutter once or the trees in the back of the sign to ripple by a wind. It's a transcendent quality that aims to introduce a span of time. Hollywood was the opposite of this, crisp shots that only allow time and room for narrative motion, never stillness.So he unspools time as a way of creating a canvas for the larger project to play out. In previous films of his mature period this was threaded around marriage, but made to register in a more cosmic way, a farewell from one existence to the next, the larger project being transitions in life. Here he pursues the natural conclusion, mortality.The story is about aging parents who visit their grown kids and grandkids in Tokyo, only to find no one really has time to spare, they're all busy in their narratives, one a neighborhood doctor, the daughter a hairdresser. Ozu tries to maintain an ambivalent stance: the kids are not unhappy to see them, nor very excited at the prospect of having to change their schedules, there is a weariness that hovers around that is not strictly unkindness. The film is set-up so that we live through the transition, so that we're going to finally travel from Tokyo to the village home of childhood for the last night together. Time is unspooled as a tool for realization. This is a simple one, loved ones should not be taken for granted, which has led some people to dismiss the film as empty. Not so. The parents' narrative is one between soulmates who have chiseled out all the emotional excess, the whys and why nots, assured in mutual presence, and there's no better happiness to ask for, no deeper art to cultivate than a shared life.The issue for me is that we're called to live through a transition means we have to shed story as we travel, it's an early appearance of the Cassavetes effect. It's so the aimlessness will be understood in retrospect as pregnant meaning. (this is were themes and aesthetics disappear into one fabric again that is our own transitory watching, if either sticks out you don't inhabit a life)Ozu's idea for shedding story is unconnected asides, here for instance the father's drinking spree with old buddies. It must have been tremendously inspiring at the time, I can't imagine Cassavetes conceiving his cinema without studying this, but I do miss here his visual concentration, his lack of pointing out the understanding. Ozu is once again held back by the need to clarify, to separate the ambiguities.So, quaint now, but you should have this in your life at some point, not because it's on a list of greats or for any moral. It's all in the worldview that is not above suffering nor bogged down by it, melancholy that is not without joy, time without the burden, bonding without attachment.When necessity parts them for one night in Tokyo, there's only the anxiety of not being able to find each other again.

It's easily understandable, yet every viewing yields something new. It stands in the past and looks at the future. Or maybe, it stands in the future and looks towards the past. It is the most Japanese of all the great Japanese films. It is a film that is still remembered after sixty-three years. It is a film that will still be remembered after sixty-three more.It is, in my opinion, the greatest non-English language live action film of all time.This is Tokyo Story.I recommend that everyone watch this movie. But there are some things you should do first. Watch some Kurosawa films. Watch some Ghibli films. Read up on the culture of Japan. Learn what a pillow shot is. Then come back and pop in this flick.There are stories that translate across cultures and generations. This is where the Hero's Journey and the Monomyth come from. But there are also stories that are specifically tied to one culture or another, that are engrained in that culture for all they are worth. One can watch them without knowing anything about their culture of origin, but the experience is... lessened.This is one of those stories.The plot is basic. An elderly couple comes to visit their kids in Tokyo, but their kids are too busy, and send their parents to a bathhouse. At its basis, this could be construed as your basic 'take care of your elders' story. But that is not doing the story justice. That is like calling LotR a basic 'kill the evil guys trying to take over the world' story.These characters are so complex, but their complexities do not get in the way of emotional power. At the end of the movie, after a potent climax, the characters gather together, and you feel for every single one of them. That is impressive.And that is just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many little intricacies to be loved about this movie. This is cinematic poetry in every meaning of that term. There are movies- movies I like and respect- where I say to myself, \"I could do better than that.\" I never once thought that when watching this movie. The dichotomy between simplicity and complexity is shown even in the title of the movie. Tokyo Story is about the simplest possible title anyone could think of for this movie. It is like naming a song ___ Song. But it is also deep. Tokyo is one of the most storied cities of all time, and at the time of this movie's release, it was just starting to recover from the massive firebombing campaign the United States waged on it in the closing days of World War II.I think of this title like a fancy door. On the surface, it is simple and functional. And if that is all someone wants to take out of it, so be it. But if one looks deeper, they can see a whole new level of symbolism and detail.Remember when I said to look up what a 'pillow shot' is. There's a reason for that. Ozu uses these to great effect, giving the audience a chance to breath and compose themselves. It is a very Japanese way of doing things. I'd love to see what would happen if pillow shots were included in their next mainstream blockbuster. But I doubt that anyone who is interested in this movie in the first place would be put off by its Japan-ness.Typically, I don't talk about the use of restraint in film- it is important, integral even but no one comes to see a film because of its effective use of restraint- but I must make an exception for this film. This is a film requiring perfect balance in every respect. If one side or viewpoint became too overpowering, the movie would no longer be one of the greatest movies of all time. It would be simply great. Vast oceans of restraint are needed at every turn. Good thing the director is Ozu.But even with all its perfections, I would not love this film nearly as much as I do if not for how much I love who the characters become and what they have to say. They do not just feel alive. They feel importantly alive. The best example of this comes when three aging businessmen sit at a bar and talk about their children. In some movies, this would be a cheap throwaway joke. In others, it would a cheap attempt at melodrama. But in this movie, it results in one of the most profound discussions I've ever heard in a movie. I was awestruck.That is the second-best scene in the movie, at least in my opinion. The best comes at the very end of the movie. I won't spoil it, but no one who watches this movie closely is unaffected by it. It captures the tone of this movie as perfectly as any scene can capture the tone of any movie.Melancholy without being depressing, insightful without being preachy, fascinating without needing to be flashy, this is one of the greatest pieces of mature, adult, thoughtful art that has ever been produced.",

I ended up blind-buying the Criterion Tokyo Story from my work because it had just been sold back used and with my employee discount it came to $15 (Le Cercle Rouge was also sold back, also $15). I didn't know if I'd like it but if I didn't I knew a LOT of people who would be willing to pay me the fifteen dollars I spent to get their hands on it, so it was all good.However, that will be unnecessary. I ended up loving just about every minute of it. I don't know quite what was different about Ozu's style this time around as opposed to Story of Floating Weeds, but I think it has something to do with it being sound-era and not having all those intertitles disrupting everything. Story of Floating Weeds was rather dialog-heavy for a silent era film, and it seems that Ozu's particular style is pretty much dialog heavy anyway, so he just works better in the sound era. That said, half the time I forgot the dialog seconds after reading it but never felt like I needed it. Even though this movie is basically people sitting around talking for two hours and fifteen minutes (with a death put in for good effect), it was a very pleasant visual experience.The whole low-angle static camera approach worked better than I ever thought possible, being a Western film student and all. I was sitting on the floor eating while I was watching it, and the angle with the television was spot on with the angles in the film, so I felt like I was either sitting around watching all of this unfold or was a little kid again watching it unfold. The best part was that I've already read all that stuff about Ozu and family, and he gets it spot on. I felt like I was at another one of my family's reunions, where everyone's happy to see each other and all but different levels of business and energy just eventually tire everyone out.Also, Ozu's quiet, methodical approach to building a quiet, almost listless world is very peaceful and alluring. With only two shots in the entire film with a moving camera, everything felt wonderfully zen (though I wouldn't label Ozu a Buddhist. His importance of family motif is a bit too worldly for Buddhists). A definite \"beingness\" pronounced the film and helped it be more than just a slide show of a family reunion.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "My wonderful introduction into the work of Ozu tells from an elder couple, Shukishi and Tomi (Chishu Ryu, Chieko Higashiyama) who make a trip to Tokyo to visit their grown-up, busy, egoistic children. Only Noriko (Setsuko Hara), the widow of their dead son, cares about them with an open heart. Soon after the parents returned to their home in a small, rural town, the mother gets sick and is about to die. The family members come together for a last visit.\"Tokyo Story\" deals with the break-up of a family and Ozu treats it in a way which is totally opposed to Hollywood manners. This gets especially obvious with the staging of the mother's death. We see the bed of the dawning woman at which the family members are gathered around. Then, Ozu cuts to a sequence of long shots showing the small provincial place: a deserted street, abandoned wharves, a boat on a river, boats in the harbor, orphaned tracks. When the camera comes back to the deathbed, the mother already has passed away. Here, Ozu does not do anything to force the dramatic art of the scene. On the contrary, he leaves out the moment of death and the instant reactions of the relatives and consequently keeps the film's balance. It is this controlled interaction of distance and balance which continuously shapes the superb production.This is shown equally well in the narrative structure and in the cautious performances of the actors, but most of all in the carefully composed simplicity of the pictures. Apart from a few exceptions, Ozu abstained from camera movements, and only in rare moments the lenses approach to the characters. The camera captures the actions from a low point of view and remains in half long shots most of the time. It is the perspective of an observer, sitting on a Tatami mat himself, like a guest who follows the course of events with contemplative calm and a due humbleness.Ozu intriguingly encounters the social course of time in the life of a family with a certain wistfulness and gentle melancholy. At the same time, he points out the necessity of such changes in the Japanese society as a whole. And perhaps that is why there lies some sort of comfort in the beauty of the pictures, because it divines that the certitude of the persistent process of time can be also a source for inner quietude.",

            "content": "There are many roads to greatness. This is a notion that I have always held to be true. No greater example of this could be given than by comparing the films of two of the greatest filmmakers from Japan. Of course, most people have heard of Akira Kurosawa and his classics like Seven Samurai, Rashomon, and Ikiru. But there is also Yasujiro Ozu (1903-1963), whose canon of films is set in modern times far more often than Kurosawa's. Where Kurosawa was grand, Ozu is small. Where Kurosawa was kinetic, Ozu was static. Where Kurosawa celebrated the epic, Ozu celebrated the ordinary. Yet, despite their differences, their greatest films are indisputable masterpieces of cinema, even if they achieve their ends in seemingly contradictory ways.Perhaps the greatest of all Ozu films is his 1953 black and white classic Tokyo Story (Tokyo monogatari), which follows a simple story outline, unfolds very slowly \u0096 the film is two hours and fifteen minutes long, builds its power through the slow accumulation of facts, and the deft, but subtle revelation of character. In short, it's everything that Hollywood films are not, and it would never have been produced there, then or now. It has been derided as being stale, dull, and plodding, even as it has alternately been chided as melodramatic and a third rate soap opera. Such definitions only go to show how little the claimants know of the words they wield.It is true, that nothing much of 'excitement' happens in the film- no murders, car chases, explosions, steamy sex scenes. It follows an old couple, from the small town of Onomichi, on a long train trip to Tokyo to visit their grown children. Some have seen the film as a remake of Leo McCarey's 1937 Hollywood sudser, Make Way For Tomorrow, but Tokyo Story is to that film what Long Day's Journey Into Night is to The Bold & The Beautiful. There, the old couple see the town, are shunted aside, then return home. The mother dies, the children come to visit, and there are some revelations, but most of the living family members just return to their own patterns of life. Yet, having watched soap operas for many years, I can tell you this film soars well beyond soap operas, which rely on archetypes and stereotypes, and the most silly plot contrivances. Everything in this film happens as it would in reality. Plus, Ozu does not milk scenes for their overwrought emotions. In fact, he wields his edits like a rapier, and excises scenes that soap operas and more standard films would include. Tokyo Story is no shameless tearjerker.Ozu is the master of narrative ellipses. As example, we do not see an early emotional farewell scene between the parents and their youngest daughter Kyoko. We do not see the parents' first stay with their youngest son Keizo (Shiro Osaka), in Osaka, as they head toward Tokyo. Another technique he mastered is that of developing subplots, such as that of the widowed daughter-in-law, Noriko, who treats the old couple far better than all but one of their children. Yet, she is not hagiographized at the expense of the other children, even as they are not demonized for their lack of care for their parents. They are simply caring and selfish, as most people are to a certain degree.Tokyo Story is a great film, all the way around, but it was ignored for many years until it was re-released in New York in 1972, with the publication of Paul Schrader's Transcendental Style In Film. Twenty years later, in the 1992 Sight And Sound film critics poll, Tokyo Story was ranked as one of the ten greatest films ever made. In 2002 it repeated that feat. It is not a film that provides easy answers, and it lacks all the phony sentimentality and contrivances Hollywood films wallow in. It is not melodramatic in the least. When Shige, as example, bursts out in tears, when Koichi says their mother has not long to live, it is not Ozu's melodrama, but the character's own, and there is a huge difference in recognizing that. That the film so perfectly captured all the Japanese conventions of the era, yet still resonates with worldwide audiences, is the mark of a great work of art, and a testament to the great circularly narrative screenplay by Ozu and K\u00f4go Noda, which deftly interweaves symbolism, such as train tracks and laundry, while capturing the way real people talk and react. Never is there a forced moment nor false reaction. The character building is superb, and the very relaxed and slow pace of the film shows what such a style can do. The film's score, by Kojun Saito is a tad over the top, at times, but understated far more often than not.If only Criterion had done their usual good job with this film the experience would have been perfect. But, don't let that deter any lover of great cinema from basking in one of the great films of all time. Tokyo Story makes its own leisurely way, but where it heads to is where all art desires to be.",

            "content": "I only got to watch this film for the first time ever about a month ago, as it is being rescreened at the OTHER CINEMA in London. I was told by my ex-Japanese teacher about 5 years ago back in secondary school that it was one of the most beautiful films ever made. I was only just getting into foreign cinema (i.e. anything not from Hollywood really) and wasn't sure what to expect and I wasn't willing to take the risk of being possibly bored to death with \"old classics\". I read many reviews written by the random public from websites such as IMDB, and I found too many unfavourable comments about it, so I thought I'd give it a miss... how wrong was I to conform to other peoples' opinions!I'm going to contradict myself now immediately after implying that one shouldn't conform to other people, because I am now going to say that it is a wonderful film and you should take my recommendation and watch it whenever you have a chance. Because of people like me, there will always be people that harshly criticise this masterpiece of a film, but because of these harsh words there will always be people like me who will praise it just a bit too much.Although in those last two paragraphs there was virtually nothing with regards to the theme and plot and acting of Tokyo Monogatari, there isn't really a need to express the overall beauty of the film, since it is a near perfect work of art from Yasujiro Ozu. His camera technique is so unique that one can immediately spot an Ozu film from a mile away. Tokyo Monogatari is that deals with family issues (Ozu's theme in all of his films), and how society messes things up so much that there is nothing that can be done to solve the problems. It leaves the viewer with a strange feeling of desperation to do something good for your parents. It may not be the most emotional and dramatic of films, but it certainly provokes a flood of emotions for the viewer to dream about in his/her sleep.I would give this a definite 10/10, and I would rate Ozu as one of the greatest directors of all time. Another two films I recommend by Ozu are FLOATING WEEDS and OHAYO.",

            "content": "Yasujir\u00f4 Ozu's 'Tokyo Story' was made in 1953, the year of my birth. 67 years have passed since then, the film is the same age as me. It addresses a recurring theme of Ozu's creation - the disintegration of the family structure under the pressure of the evolution of modern society (some call it progress). It is a film about the relationships between parents and children, about caring for the elderly and caring for those who come after us, about the time we dedicate to the family, about love and loneliness. Today, when I also have in care my 90-year-old mother, when I am a father and a grandfather, this film is perfectly actual for me and talks about situations that I experienced and feelings and emotions I went through in my life, which started in the year the movie was made. At the same time, it is a film that describes more eloquently than a library of historical books the situation of Japan eight years after the end of the war that changed the course of history and reshaped the character of the nation. The characterization of \"Tokyo Story' as one of the best films ever made is not exaggerated.The story. Shukici and Tomi Hirayama live in a remotevillage located a day train ride away from Tokyo. They are old, they have raised five children, three boys (one of whom died in the war) and two girls. Only the youngest girl remained with them, life and careers took the other away to Tokyo and Osaka. We are in 1953, people were still writing letters and sending them by mail, long distance telephone calls or telegrams were the means of rapid communication used only in emergencies. The elderly couple go on a trip to the great metropolis to visit their children and meet their grandchildren. They are received with apparent respect and Japanese ceremonial, but in reality the children (the physician son, the beautician daughter) don't have much time for them and they don't even know how and what to communicate. The differences of generations, of lifestyles and environments have their say. Shared traditions and memories are not enough to create true cohesion. Feelings exist, but the priorities of the active and busy life of the townspeople take precedence, at least until the mother's health proves to be fragile and the children will be the ones to make their way back to the village where they started their lives.Ozu's style is perfectly polished in this film. The frames are fixed most of the time (only once I think, the camera moves) and the world is seen from the height of the eyes, like in paintings representing mostly indoors. Each scene becomes a refined visual composition, a setting with geometric frames in which each object adds functionality, balance, beauty. Within these frames the characters move and live, communicating with each other but also with the spectators represented by the camera. The acting interpretations are magnificent, I think I could write a whole story about each character, that much I got to know them at the end of the two hours of watching. I will mention two actors who I think are making top creations here: Chish\u00fb Ry\u00fb, the actor who accompanied Ozu throughout his career and who featured in 52 of his 54 films in the role of the father, and Setsuko Hara, the muse and Ozu's favorite actress in the final part of his career, who plays the luminous role of Noriko, the elders' daughter-in-law, and the widow of their fallen son, who turns out to be closer and more devoted to them than their true children. When the camera is taken outside (maybe about 10% of the film's duration) we get a glimpse of a Japan in transformation, a Japan after the storm, with obvious social and landscape changes, a world where family, tradition, and human feelings struggle to survive. 'Tokyo Story' is a film that is very Japanese and very universal at the same time, one of those cinematographic works that is destined for eternity both as a document and as a perennial human message.",

Cinematography is absolutely still like a careful observant in the room while editing progresses the story gradually & effectively. Music makes its entrance at key moments, adding more emotional punch and the performances by the entire cast is very honest & carried out with much politeness.On an overall scale, Tokyo Story is mainly about the growing distance between parents & children that subtly portrays the indifference, selfishness & ingratitude of the younger generation who consider the very people who sacrificed so much to nourish them into responsible human beings as a burden, and over the years with every passing generation, its universal theme keeps getting more n more resonant & will continue to do so for a very long time.",

My wife dozed fitfully throughout but I was cursed with a bout of insomnia. This is a very dull film by any standards and the static cinematography does not do justice to what could well be ravishingly beautiful shots of post-war Japan. The acting is extremely mannered. The dialogue (though this could be the fault of the translation) is some of the most clich\u00e9d I have ever seen in a movie. Worst of all though, I believe Tokyo Story suffers from a problem that many modern American blockbusters exhibit. As a viewer I got the message loud and clear by the time the old couple leave Tokyo and everything after that was superfluous. I couldn't believe how many extra scenes followed. Apart from the daughter-in-law, all the children are ungrateful brats. Yes, thank you. It's obvious how badly they are all going to act when the mother dies and showing it is just an insult to our intelligence. \"Stop the film\" I wanted to cry out time and time again. A good example of the redundancy is right at the end: shot of old man looking lonely; shot of river; shot of old man; shot or river; closer shot of river. I can only think that you need a much closer affinity with Japanese culture to understand the subtleties. Either that or be a pretentious film critic. I would also add that I do not consider myself to a philistine or addicted to modern action films. I am in my fifties and have a very wide taste in film. Kurusawa's film Ikuru is one of my all time favourites and it has a lot in common with Tokyo Story but IMHO it is superior in every aspect to this over-rated and stupendously dull movie.",

They decide to visit their two eldest children, who live in Tokyo: Koichi (S\u00f4 Yamamura), whom Shukichi and Tomi believed to be a prominent city doctor, but is actually a harried local practitioner and Shige (Haruko Shugimura), who is a beautician. Neither of them has too much time for their parents. Koichi is too busy with work, and his young, rowdy children openly disdain their grandparents, whom they have never met before. Shige, the eldest daughter, is considerably worse, as she continually voices her disapproval with her parents and scolds her husband for attempting to treat them with nice gestures (Shugimura plays her character's meanness with relish). The elderly couple has also a younger daughter, Kyoko (Kyoko Kagawa) who still lives with them and works as a schoolteacher in their hometown. Kyoko resents their elder siblings' aloofness towards their parents. A fourth son, Keizo, appears only towards the end of the movie, seemingly also indifferent to the fate of his parents.At the end, their children's indifference prompts the elderly couple to return early to their hometown, but in their trip back Tomi gets ill and dies soon after reaching home.Clearly the elder children had some unresolved resentment towards their parents: we don't know exactly the reason for it, though Shukichi's alcoholism when he was younger is mentioned several times in the movie.Only their daughter in law Noriko (the wonderful Setsuko Hara, a regular in many Ozu movies), the widow of their fallen son during World War II, treats them with kindness and attention while they are in Tokyo. In the movie's climatic, tear inducing scene, Noriko initially protests to Shukichi that she is not such a nice person, and that she is really selfish. And we come to understand what she means by this: as sweet and humane as she is, Noriko is also seeking closure to her husband's death in the war, and with her attention and niceties she is desperately looking for her parents in-laws approval: when he is happy to give her that in the final scene, encouraging her to forget his son and find a new husband, she breaks down with tears in one of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema.",

This is, in my opinion, one of his most accessible efforts, although you have to be at least used to Japanese or classic cinema in order to fully appreciate it, otherwise it is more likely that you'll find yourself not caring much about what's happening, on account of Ozu's pacing style. Without any doubt, this film has to be one of Ozu's most complete works, it contains every single technique and theme he's widely recognized for. I also find the music sounding throughout some parts of the film really beautiful and catchy, which doesn't mean I'm giving less praise to other tunes in many of his other films (they are individually amazing), but this has just been the one I find more fitting concerning the story, and definitely the one I've most liked as well. The acting is at its finest, everyone fits their roll perfectly (it was hilarious watching Chishu Ryu impersonating a drunk and somewhat disappointed father). To conclude this review, I know I might probably not be adding anything relevant or new to this film (I'm aware there are more extensive and better explained reviews here), but I just wanted to make one for such a riveting and fascinating movie that's deserving of all the praise it gets.

What takes place in the film is just life itself. It's about the not uncommon difficulties of generations that have to deal with each other, where natural gaps arise after the children have moved away from their parents and each family member is living a different life now - all things we might have experienced ourselves in a similar fashion from the one or the other side, or even from both. Everybody tries his/her best in their own kind of way when it comes to a visit. One means well, stays polite, but the lives the family members lead are their own now. While the parents don't want to impose on their children, the children are fine when their parents are on their way again so that things take their regular course to which they are used to. But in between many things are left unsaid. \"Tokyo Story\" shows us in its realistic depiction of a Japanese family that only when something major happens which stirs the daily routines and challenges our outlook we become aware of what's important and where our allegiances really lie.Ozu's unobtrusive direction is what makes this film so touching and powerful. He stays true to life and just shows us what's happening, doesn't judge, and typical of Ozu decides to refrain from camera movements altogether throughout the film which strengthens the impression that this is just how things happen out there. \"Tokyo Story\" is a quiet and contemplative work and the actors seem to be taken right from reality. That's why this simple story has such an impact and ranks as one of the greatest - it hits close to home, where it resonates deeply.",

(What we have nowadays doesn't come from a master negative but from dupes)If you've seen your share of Ozu, you know the modus operandi: the stories recur from one movie to the other, similar shots, same actors, even the same names for characters. And predominantly, the same radical way of seeing the world: the multi-layered, meditative, agile (despite being stationary!) and deeply dimensional eye that pierces simultaneously through multiple rooms; characters are positioned to the frame just like any other object, conversing with each other and also with the surrounding space. Much of this sense of space comes from Ozu shooting low, close to the tatami, meaning that the ceilings are often visible.The story is never extraneous, nor is it melodramatic. The undertow of loss is ever as poignant here, a complete antipode to the light family banter in its two predecessors in the \"Noriko\" trilogy. We've waded warm and pleasant waters so far, even when considering there's been departure. The word \"you'll get better\" will break your heart, as will \"I'd have been kinder to her\" delivered with apparent fake cheer by the surviving widow. This will make one think of one's own parents, and if you're married, your own wife and children. What a gift we've been given in them!It will always remain a mystery why Hara's character in all the three films is named Noriko \u2014 not the same Noriko, but still obviously a central element and a link between the three. There are other curiosities: the young children in \"Bakush\u00fb\" (1951) are named Minoru and Isamu, just as they are in this film. Minoru is actually played by the same boy, Murase Zen.The music is brilliant, and the main theme is one of the greatest in film history.",

            "content": "It's films like Yasujir\u014d Ozu's 'Tokyo Story' that transcend the idea of a movie and enter the realm of art in its most pure and provoking form. Often considered the greatest achievement by a directed who constantly challenged his audience with pensive and realistic material, 'Tokyo Story' is a heartbreaking look at the passage of time and the gradual estrangement that unfolds between two parents and their absentee children. The realism of the film is undeniable, much of which stems from Ozu's long series of pillow shots seen throughout the film. These shots are cutaways, for no obvious narrative reason, that serve to add that extra depth and sentiment by letting the natural landscape and surrounding themes sink in that much more. Many of Ozu's pillow shots convey darkness or the transience of family memories and, by letting these shots linger on for several seconds, his narrative is quietly telling us that the flow of the world around them continues to truck along. These shots are as enigmatic as the feelings of the characters we come to know in the film, saying one thing but doing so with faces that would suggest a hidden subtext. At the film's most heartbreaking moments, we struggle to understand exactly HOW they feel though it's clear to us that their suffering exists - but to what end? Truly one of the most beautifully crafted creations to come out of Japanese cinema and even cinema in general. This film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.",

            "content": "I don't know if it has to do with some of the translation into English, but some of the dialog in this film seems to me to be plainly offensive. For example, when the old woman Tomi Hirayama (Chieko Higashiyama) speaks to her daughter-in-law Noriko (Setsuko Hara), who's husband, the older woman's son, had died, she makes the remark \"What a treat to sleep in my dead son's bed\". What??!! I thought that was terribly insensitive.Or when the family members discuss the mother's passing, Shige (Haruko Sugimura) states that she wishes the old man had died first. She qualified her statement with a logical reason, but gee, that just sounded so awful bad, but in her case, Shige had already established that she wasn't very politically correct among her family members.And then there's the old man himself, Shukichi (Chish\u00fb Ry\u00fb), who attempts to convince his daughter-in-law Noriko to remarry. With seeming indifference to the death of his own son a year earlier, he says \"Forget about Shoji, he's dead.\" Do you think Noriko had to be reminded of that depressing fact? I know this, a movie is getting to me when I have to get up and pace around the room in order to force myself to stay with it. I pretty much understand what the director was trying to achieve here by showing the indifference siblings can show toward their elderly parents. How they'd rather not be bothered unless there's something in it for them. And obviously I'm at a disadvantage by not knowing the Japanese culture and it's approach to the concept of dying. But this just didn't strike me as being the noteworthy film it's hailed to be with it's position in the IMDb rating system. Sometimes I find a second viewing of a film to help with my appreciation of the effort, but this one I'll be giving a pass.One final observation - what's the obsession with fanning one's self throughout the picture?",

            "review_title": "Ozu's greatest soap opera.",
            "content": "Yasujiro Ozu has been called  \"the most Japanese of Japanese directors\". That's doubtless correct, insofar as the director is insistent upon an adherence to a rigid form in his directing style.  One doesn't have to be a cultural anthropologist to glean the Japanese concern with traditional motifs and the patient perfecting of a given aesthetic.But I'm guessing that this is not so true of today's Japan, and I'm also guessing that, deep-down, many critics and audiences over there right now probably find Ozu insufferably old-fashioned.  One wonders if the exulting of Ozu is a dig from cultural snobs toward Akira Kurosawa, who dared to base his movies on pulpy American detective novels and John Ford Westerns.  In any case, it's important to point out that Ozu's directing style is rather his own style, not some sort of  \"traditional\"  Japanese style.  This is what should be celebrated about Ozu.  He's an original artist, over and above being a  \"Japanese artist\".  And his greatest film, *Tokyo Story*, is only  \"Japanese\"  in its particulars.  After all, elderly parents being ignored by their busy grown-up children are not exclusive to Japan.That famous style consists of no panning with the camera, and keeping the camera at just above floor level.  The static mise-en-scene is broken up with cuts of close-ups in which the actors speak directly to the camera, as if the camera has taken the POV of the listener.  Occasionally, in the case of  *Tokyo Story*, there are exterior shots of Tokyo itself, jackhammering busily away under the Marshall Plan.  (The movie is set several years after World War II.)  Ozu's martinet control of both composition and the actors -- all of whom are tightly reined in by stylized performances -- is actually a benefit to the story, which is really nothing more than a weepy soap opera, let's face it.  The manner in which the carefully written dialogue and the overall formal restraint of the piece overcomes the melodramatic tendencies of the script is really quite astonishing -- it's art of the most difficult kind.  Put it this way:  imagining this movie redone in America will give one a sense of deep appreciation for both Ozu's microscopic control and for the foreign setting itself.The movie is generous to its characters, despite all the outward restraints. We're not meant to hate the adult children, who are only too willing to shuttle off their aging parents to a  \"spa\"  that turns out to be little better than a bordello for decadent young hipsters.  Ozu ruefully shows us how the War had turned a whole generation of young Japanese into calloused survivors so consumed with rebuilding and then maintaining a semblance of normal life that there's no time or room for traditional family values anymore -- indeed, no time or room for extended family, period.  We're meant to sympathize with these characters, as they struggle under the new realities of post-War Japan.  And even deeper than this, Ozu has something to say about the heartlessness of Time:  Life Goes On, and whole generations come and go and are promptly forgotten.  \"Life is disappointing,\"  one character exclaims.It can be argued that if you've seen one Ozu film, then you've seen them all.  (Well, I can argue that, at least.  Sorry, but I prefer the variety of Kurosawa.)  In that case, *Tokyo Story*  is the Ozu film you must see.  I grant that the director's platitudinizing may make you feel that you should give your mother a call . . . but is that such a bad thing?",

            "content": "\"Tokyo Story\" is an incredibly poignant film by Yasujiro Ozu about grandparents tonwards the end of their lives that visit their children.The children, however, while trying to be respectful, simply don't have time for them (or don't want to have time for them) and therefore the grandparents seem to be a burden to them. Shige even seems to dislike them, and insults them on certain occasions, but not in an over the top way, but rather a pretend playful way. Many of the shots are in frames within frames and I think this is to emphasize the different worlds that each generation inhabits, and how they are separated by age. It is also composed of mostly low angle shots and seemingly 2 dimensional compositions. There are many poignant moments in the film regarding time and age, all ending with a sadly realistic but silent ending. The first is when the grandmother, Tomi, is with the youngest grandchild outside. The child has his back to the grandmother while she asks him what he wants to be when he grows up. He doesn't respond, but she thinks about it anyway. Then she states that she might be dead when he is grown up, and she follows him as if to try and reach back into her youth.The grandparents are sent to a spa at one point by their children, but the spa ends up being too lively for them. This shows that maybe they are getting too old for the world, and their time has passed. This is the first time they are visiting Tokyo, but at this point they may be too old. When Shukishi, the grandfather, gets back together with his friends that he used to drink with (apparently too much), we get the feeling that it isn't like it used to be. It's a much more depressing time. One of his friends expresses his disappointment towards his sons low position in work, and his regret for raising him the way he did. He also mentions that losing a child is hard, but now living with them can be just as hard. Shukishi feels similarly toward his son who is simply a neighborhood doctor, but he says that times change, and you can't expect too much for your children. His other friend has lost all of his children. He doesn't say a word throughout the whole conversation other than mumbling drunkenly. Tomi stays with Noriko, her daughter in law who was married to the son that died. Tomi isn't related through blood, but does more for them than any of their real children. Tomi is desperate for her to get remarried, since at this point she knows how lonely she will feel without a husband on her older age.When Shukishi and Tomi reunite, Tomi gets sick on the train, and before they know it, she is in critical condition. She dies soon after, but it's important to remember the fact that Ozu never gives in to the usual sentimentality films usually resort to in order to make you feel something. It has an ear for the usual happenings of life and the silence in between the dialogue, as well as the small talk we resort to so we don't have to open up about our doubts and fears and hopes and regrets.They visited one of their grandchildren, Keizo, before she went into critical condition, and it shows him joking that he must be a good grandchild to them because you can't be a good grandchild to them while they are in the grave. But despite him first considering the encounter as a nuisance, once he finds out Tomi is dead, he can't bear the idea that she will just be lost in the sea of graves that he sees before him. He admits he wished he spent more time with her. He simply didn't realize how fragile her life was. Shukishi stays away from his children when he hears about the death of his wife, but doesn't cry. He is simply empty. He gives Noriko his wife's watch as she was their only true child through all of this. She thinks she doesn't deserve it because sometimes she \"goes for days on end not thinking about him (her ex wife and their dead son)\", but this isn't about him. It's about her, and her kindness. For the first time since her husband she feels loved, and she ends up with the happiest of the endings. Shukishi then goes home and sits. Alone. Probably for the rest of his life. Sadly, it's also implied that they didn't get along for much of their marriage, so it wasn't that loving to begin with. And if we don't end up at that point eventually in our lives, then we will probably be dead. That's the sad truth of life and probably the true ending after Norikos happy ending. Children grow away form their parents, and parents grow old.\"Isn't life disappointing?\" Kyoko asks. \"Yes, it is\" Noriko responds, smilingly.",

            "content": "1954 was one hell of a year for the Japanese film industry. Other than the fact that they're poor after WW2 ended, 1954 was probably the best Japanese film year to date. The 3 greatest directors of Japan, Kenji Mizoguchi, Akira Kurosawa, and Yasujiro Ozu, release by far their greatest creations. (Although Ugetsu was 1953, Sansho the Baliff was also great) Oh and I forgot that GODZILLA was also 1954 too. There's no denying Japanese Cinema was at their peak in 1954. There was Seven Samurai, Sansho the Baliff, Godzilla, and then there's Tokyo Story which is the film we're going to focus on today.Tokyo Story tells the most simple and boring tale of family about grandparents visiting their son's place for a while and see how everyone is doing. It is hard to describe the power of this film without spoiling the ending. The ending makes up the emotions. The power of boredom is that it is normal, silent, and yet when something happens, we would end up reacting to it for no reason. Boredom is the weapon that Ozu always chose to tell his story.Each one of his stories have special messages on life that are worth learning about. His stories might be the same, but they each hold power that many people don't see.\nThe camera never moves a single inch. It is one foot above the ground. Moving the camera would mean you would break the power of boredom and you would expect action out of a character. That's why Kurosawa is so moving with his action. Tokyo Story is the perfect and most Japanese film that you'll ever get. Japanese drinking sake, having nice dinners, and overall living their lives to the best. Keep in mind that this film was after WW2 so the film is like an escapist film. The film is like the only source back then that can get Japanese people happy with their lives and help them forget about the war.",

But examining the character developments of the film and subtle and brilliant acting by the entire cast makes it very worthwhile. The cinematography is striking, with immersive shots of characters marked by confrontation and symmetry.What I found to be perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the film was the sophisticated directional style by Ozu, who relies on indirect storytelling and insinuation rather than obvious behavioral messages exemplified throughout the film. This is truly impressive, as the attentive viewer may notice.Highly recommended!",

He takes us to an emotional sanctuary where we can observe without averting our eyes. Ozu does not try to jerk our feelings around or deliberately set out to make us cry. He does not try to dazzle us intellectually or do anything creative or new. Rather he simply shows us an idealized transformation through stages of life where we can arrive at a state of peace through acceptance of \"normal\" events. There are no bad guys or good guys here, but simple declarations about life in the most monumentally unadorned style possible. A great, great work of art. My all-time favorite.",

            "content": "The film tells the story of aged parents visiting their children in Tokyo and depicts the treatment they receive from them on the visit. The beauty of the movie lies in its simplicity, be it the story itself or the storytelling style of the legendary Ozu, or the acting by the cast members who all draws a very thin line between acting/ reality and most of the time their performance are on the side of reality. It is very easy here to see the treatment of the children as they grow old towards their aging parents, yet barring few scenes we don't see children as villains but rather persons with their own family, work, and life in big city and very less time to take care of their parents. Few scenes towards the end actually clears all the air of confusion in our mind in taking children as villain and we all get to know their traits and there's nothing but hate left in us for them. Throughout the movie we also see the fine daughter-in law of these old couple and what a Good Samaritan she is treating her in laws as her own parents even after the death of her husband. Direction by Ozu is brilliant and I instantly became fan and just waiting for the opportunity to explore some other movies of this master of cinema. Overall, I would say this is one of the simplest yet powerful and best pictures of all time. The movie though more than half century old still owns significance in present time. A must see.",

The oldest living son has a full family with a wife and two sons of his own and a demanding career, so he's very busy. He seems to be in his early 40s. The second daughter seems to be in her 30s and working feverishly to develop her career. The middle son is in his 20s, brimming with life and professional devotion, and the youngest daughter is still very much attached to her parents .The older children are busy and heavily involved in their professional lives. They're not exactly evil, but they do neglect their parents a bit when they come to visit them in Tokyo and try to shuffle them around with different people.The widow is the only one who treats them decently, taking time off of work to be with them and patiently letting them stay in her home despite not being a blood relation to them. It would appear that she, having come to an early understanding of life because of her husband's premature death, is outside of the rat race and cherishes the fleeting nature of life and social connections more than the others.One interesting aspect is the limited range of emotions shown by most of the characters, which is probably a Japanese thing. Most of the women are always smiling even when faced with annoyances, disappointments, and unfairness. The daughter in law, especially, never stops smiling except in those moments when the emotional burden of memories or worries momentarily becomes too much to bear. Perhaps the most powerful moment in the film is when she, with a full broad smile, unceremoniously admits to the youngest daughter that life is, indeed, just one big disappointment.What is to be done, eh?It's a slow-paced movie and most of the shots look very similar - a door or part of a building framing the action with the camera seeming to be slightly facing upward. Also, for all the deep scenes, there are twice as many mundane scenes just meant to build the sensation of realism.Nevertheless, this is a meaningful and thoughtful film that provokes reflection on ageing, death, and family.Honourable Mentions: No les Llores en La Tumba - a powerful corrido about how people should appreciate their loved ones while they are alive, sung by Los Originales de San Juan. Surprisingly not a major theme of this film - there doesn't seem to be much regret about anything at the end. Nevertheless, it's thematically related.",

            "content": "This is a beautiful film, meticulously and lovingly directed by Yasujiro Ozu, with a very basic story that conveys very profound messages about our relatively brief time on this earth. On a different but related level, this is one of the most fascinating depictions of life in post-World War II Japan that I have ever seen. The war, with enormously traumatic and devastating consequences to the people of Japan, had ended only eight years earlier.Although I am not an expert at the \"tatami-mat\" camera shot, which is taken from the floor to the ceiling of the several interior rooms, almost every scene seems like a framed painting to me with the central characters deliberately placed in specific positions that convey a statement about their cultural, social or emotional status. To the director, Ozu, the placement of objects or people in a frame is of great importance.By focusing on relatively insignificant cultural differences, such as mannerisms and intonation of speech, many reviewers regrettably miss the most important messages of the film which include, among other themes, the precious value of life itself, which can be taken from us on very short notice, and how challenging the quest for happiness may be while we live, regardless of our physical age.Other reviews have sufficiently described the simple story, so I won't repeat what has already been written. The segment of the elderly couple being shipped to the inappropriately \"lively\" Atami spa/resort demonstrates how disconnected the couple's children are from their own parents during the closing stage of their lives to the point that their selfish neglect actually causes the mother serious, physical harm.Beyond the film's very important theme concerning the universal, human condition of being insensitively discarded by society and family as we advance in age, another significant aspect of the film is the very subtle but compelling message of the human cost of war to Japan. We witness this in the pathetic reunion of the elderly drinking buddies as they discuss the loss of their sons to the war, and, even more dramatically, we feel it from the sad loss experienced by Noriko, the kind, devoted daughter-in-law, as if we are living her deep sorrow firsthand. Accolades to the beautiful Setsuko Hara, who portrays a profoundly conflicted woman so impeccably. While Noriko feels obligated to present a smiling face to the world, Hara's wonderful acting ability allows us to realize the deep sadness that exists beneath her happy, outward appearance. Behind the beautiful exterior smile lies immense suffering. I can't help from thinking that Noriko symbolizes Japan, itself, as the nation struggles through a very difficult and complicated period in its history.",

Although it has probably been commented on already, Setsuko Hara's portrayal of Noriko is amazing. She plays the daughter in law role perfectly. She has the perfect mixture of sweetness and awkwardness. You want to see her be happy, as she seems to be the only person who has time for the parents.

They even try to stop spending time with them by trying to send them the inexpensive Atami Hot Springs resort, only daughter-in-law Noriko Hirayama (Setsuko Hara), who was made a widow when her husband Shoji killed eight years ago in the war, is making any effort and treating them nicely during their trip. As Shukishi and Tomi realise that their grown up children are not very fond of having them around, each of their offspring are realising the effects of their actions, and it may be too late to make up for their general behaviour both from the past and during the trip time, especially when Tomi dies, and Shukishi has to try to connect with them after the loss. Also starring Kuniko Miyake as Fumiko Hirayama \u2013 Koichi's wife. The performances are all fine, especially by the older two leading stars and by the actress playing the sweet daughter-in-law, it is a simple story about family who do not connect as well as they should, I will confess it was a little hard to follow what was going while having the read the subtitles as well, but what I gathered made a watchable drama. Very good!",

            "content": "\"Tokyo Story\" tells a tale as simple and universal as life itself. It is about a few ordinary days in the lives of some ordinary people, and then about the unanticipated death of one of them. What it tells us about the nature of life or death is not new or original \u2014 what could be? \u2014 but it is true.It doesn't want to force our emotions, but to share its understanding. It does this so well that I am near tears in the last 30 minutes. It ennobles the cinema. It says, yes, a movie can help us make small steps against our imperfections.It was made 60 years ago in Japan, and it is about our families, our natures, our flaws and our clumsy search for love and meaning. It isn't that our lives keep us too busy for our families. It's that we have arranged them to protect us from having to deal with big questions of love, work and death. We escape into truisms, small talk and distractions. Given the opportunity at a family gathering to share our hopes and disappointments, we talk about the weather and watch TV.The film's director Ozu is not only a great director but a great teacher, and after you know his films, a friend. With no other director do I feel affection for every single shot. Every single shot is intended to have a perfect composition of its own, even if that means there are continuity errors. All the shots are framed in some way. In the foreground of the interior shots, perhaps tucked in a corner.If there is movement in an Ozu film, it comes from nature or people, not from the camera. He often shows a room before people enter, and lingers a second after they leave. If characters go upstairs, they are absent precisely long enough to actually do that. If a character is speaking, he shows the entire speech. No cutaways, no listening shots, no overlapping dialogue. He is comfortable with silences.There are scenes that will be hard to forget: The mother and father separately thanking the daughter-in-law for her kindness; the father's laborious drunken odyssey through a night of barroom nostalgia; and his reaction when he learns that his wife will probably die.\"Tokyo Story\" moves quite slowly by our Western standards, and requires more patience at first than some moviegoers may be willing to supply. Its effect is cumulative, however; the pace comes to seem perfectly suited to the material.",

It takes place, for the most part, in \"real time,\" moving (as does Life itself, from moment to moment) with a gradual inexorability toward The End. Death humbles us all. We're left only with reflections and regrets. Ozu's unflinching manner of movie-making can cause us to squirm uncomfortably in our seats. The old man, left alone in the end, gazing out at the world as it continues on despite his most profound loss, sums it up best when a neighbor stops to look in at him: \"Living alone, a day lasts too long.\" The neighbor moves on, but the look on the old man's face, the trembling of his Adam's apple as he fights back the tears, speaks volumes.

His films are as anti-Hollywood as you can go.Instead of telling \"Greatest Story Ever Told\", Ozu tells the \"Simplest Story Ever Told\". Background score is scarcely used and the camera is barely moved but the resultant product is still beyond comparison.Ozu's movies revolve around families, their interactions, their habits, their manners and their quirks. This movie centers around an old couple who in their twilight decide to visit their brood. Though their grown up children who are themselves very busy are not able to give them much attention, the parent don't make any dramatic statements. They just praise the daughter-in-law who did spend some time with them and is most affectionate. Part of the reason is that they are too polite ,another part it that they are subconsciously convincing themselves that things are not that bad and also they understand that the children have their own busy lives to lead.I know it sounds like more of a soap opera than a movie, but this is more touching and realistic than the best of Hollywood movies and without employing any sappy music or sappy dialog.I really loved all the performances, but Setsuko Hara has done an amazing job. I look forward to watching all her movies with Ozu.",

            "content": "Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story is one of the all time favorites chosen by fellow directors, and it is easy to see why. It does not have a spectacular story, and instead it focuses on being relatable in a way that can literally be compared to average people from everywhere. The most important aspect i think that Ozu has done to create this emotional piece of art that lives and breathes is the fact that he creates such an immersion to the story that you feel like you are an actual part of it. He seemingly creates this immersion by using a lot of extremely low camera angles which are apparantly called 'tatami-shots', in which it seems as though the viewer is sitting on a mat right next to our characters ( Or, shall we say, in the next room as Ozu also has a habit of having these kind of shots positioned in another room so that we can still have a clear overview of our characters. ). Furthermore, we notice a lot of shot reverse-shot techniques in which it looks as though the characters are speaking to the camera, which also increases immersion as this is a beautiful way by Ozu of making clear they are speaking to the audience too. These pure filmmaking techniques by Ozu is a perfect way to increase the immersion in his world, and it works perfectly.The acting performances are all very good, but especially Noriko ( Setsuko Hara ) gives off an exceptional performance as the outwardly cheerful yet innerly quite troubled widow of the elderly couple's son. All of the other characters are quite selfish and after a certain tragic event later in the film their indifference is such a powerful statement from Ozu to the audience to subtly point out the flaws in the average human being. It is, in a way, also a story about old people in a young city that seemingly does not have a place for them ( Similar to the way released long time convicts are portrayed in The Shawshank Redemption, who feel as though they have no place in this world ) which brings up the inability of modern society to care about our elders.It is also further enhanced by fantastic cinematography and great shots of the scenery of Tokyo, Osaka & Onomichi which shows us that we are but little people in such a big place, and that life has to go on. The before stated low camera angles and beautiful japanese cultural indoor scenery also take part in creating a visually beautiful experience. The music by Takanobu Saito also uses fantastic violins to enhance the emotional attachment to the film.In the end this is a simple story that could happen to every average person, which is also primarily what makes it so relatable. Yet also visually impressive with great acting, a great soundtrack and all the while observing an ages long moral human dilemma about connecting with our elders, it is a film that transcends its 'simple' story bounds by a long shot.",

People grow old, people get sick, children drift away, times change and eventually we no longer keep up, war and other calamities upend our lives and bring heartbreak and loss. Disappointing? Of course.But then there is Noriko, the daughter in law--sweet and lovely and kind. There is the great heart and gentle nature of the mother. There is the ultimately strong feeling of the father for his wife (conveyed in a beautifully restrained performance). There are children--some of them downright unlikeable--who populate the background of this film and serve as a reminder of life continuing. They too will have their disappointment, but still.... Hope simply won't go away.Ozu shows it all without moralizing, without flourishes or crescendos, without attempting to make some \"point\" that helps us to make sense of it all. He presents his characters non-judgmentally, with real characteristics that make them understandable.It is Ozu's rich humanism that makes the film so sad. It is a story that for all of its quietness, has the power of great tragedy.",

Exemples are \"Make way for tomorrow\" (1937, Leo McCarey) and (as a subplot) \"All that heaven allows\" (1955, Douglas Sirk).There are films in which the parents are disappointed by their children. An example is \"Everybody is fine\" (1990, Giuseppe Tornatore).\"Tokyo story\" has both these themes, and combines them in a marvelous fashion. The story is told by little gestures. How estranged the eldest son has become from his parents turns out when he has to introduce his son (which is not a baby anymore) to his grandparents. In another scene the disappointment of the father with his children becomes explicit after some sake during a night out with old friends. When he comes home drunk, the reaction of his wife gives the impression that drinking is a bad habit of him she knows from the past.So \"Tokyo story\" is therefore not a film about \"good guys\" (the parents) and \"bad guys\" (the children. It is much more nuanced. The scene described above hints at the fact that the parents may not always have been cute oldies, and not all children are selfish. The daughter in law (the wife of their son who has fallen in the Second World War) is more than willing to spend time with her parents in law and show them Tokyo.This daughter in law is called Noriko and is played by Setsuko Hara. Setsuko Hara had played the character of Noriko before in \"Banshun\" (1949) and \"Early summer\" (1951). Togehther these three films are called the \"Noriko trilogy\" of Ozu and are considered by many as the zenith of his oeuvre.",

The director broke the 180 degree rule, the camera just about never moves, and it is always either at eye level or on the ground. I personally don't care about the technology that went into this creation. Not because it was an easy task, but because the story and actors are the prime focus which leaves the camera work a secondary thought.Yasujiro Ozu is known for creating simple tales with huge results. His 1953 loose remake of Leo McCarey's \"Make Way For Tomorrow\" is his hottest film as well as the one with the biggest emotional impact. Fun fact about the original: Orson Welles once told Peter Bogdanovich that \"Make Way For Tomorrow\" could make a rock cry. Believe it or not, the Japanese remake is way more emotional.The basic premise of \"Tokyo Story\" is pretty simple: an elderly couple travel to suburban Tokyo to spend time with their successful kids and grandchildren, but their kids had very little time for them. Now this is the story in a nutshell. Things do happen, but people like to say the story in its simplest form to reflect the simplicity of its creation. I mentioned how easy the camera work was, but the development of the characters are anything but.The couple have been married for years and they have five children, four of who are still living. Their youngest is a teacher who still lives with them and the rest are in Tokyo. Their oldest son is a doctor who gets called a lot. There's a scene where they plan on going site-seeing but they must be scrapped when he is called for a patient. This is the first indicator of the little time to be spent and it already is heartbreaking. They don't want to be an inconvenience and they are proud that their kids are so successful. But we can tell they are disappointed in being second fiddle.A little while later, his wife falls ill. The kids need to know how selfish they were being, even if they couldn't help it. The movie is often divided into two parts with the visit and the illness. Both are sad and both build so perfectly.The main reason I don't want to dive deep into the story and really dissect it all is not because of the difficulties of the names, I just think the best thing to do is to watch the movie for yourself and experience an all time great.Unlike \"Hereditary,\" \"Roma,\" or \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire,\" this is a slow-burner that is actually good and isn't slow just because. The story keeps moving and we keep getting to know the characters better. The movie is 136 minutes, but I was loving this so much I wanted it to go even longer. The gradual builds really immerse the viewer. And it is next to impossible to not feel throughout the film. Only the strongest of emotions are elicited.4/4",

I'm also sure many who attempt to watch this film won't even get past the first 15-20mins. And, it will be these folk who will die without ever allowing themselves to fully experience the real-life family emotions that motivate this fine work. So, it's with great pleasure I find this curiously simple (yet complex) movie being so highly regarded between differing cultures. In some ways, it made me think of the Michael Powell/Emeric Pressburger British classic \"A Canterbury Tale\". While it's true there may be little to compare between the two, they each brought a rich reward to the thoughtful viewer who stayed to the end. Sensitivity is a gift many lack. The remastered (Criterion) DVD releases are to be commended for quality; the one I screened was the Madman release.

Somebody did find the scene of the three old men getting drunk to be humorous, but I'm confounded if I see it that part as anything but maudlin and pathetic.My family and I lived for four years in Japan, and learned to speak some and read enough to follow street signs, at least. Some of the most striking things about this movie for me were the views of Tokyo and the infrastructure. How did they manage to rebuild their factories to rebuild their train system, only eight years after the end of the war?I gather that the Japanese of the 1950's were not a great deal like the Japanese I knew in the 80's, although the connections across three decades were visible. The Japanese women of my neighborhood were a lot more like Noriko than Shige. The older men I knew reminded me of the father -- self absorbed and uninterested in the women around them. Did you notice the way the father behaves at Atami? When he and the mother sit on the causeway and decide to go back home to Onomichi, she stands up but feels dizzy. He basically tells her to shake it off and walks on, not even looking back to see how she is. Again, after the funeral, a neighbor asks how he's doing and he talks a bit about his days will seem long without the mother's company. It's all about him, right?Reviewers notice how Noriko, the widow of a son killed in the war, is the only one who shows any compassion and interest in the parents, her in-laws. This is matched by the fact that none of the rest of the family, all of whom seem relatively successful, have any real interest in her. They have reasonably decent houses while she lives in a crappy apartment building with shared kitchen and bath facilities.Overall, I found the Japanese I knew in the 1980's to be easy to like, hard to love. With that I experience, I watched Tokyo Story and found it hard to like, hard to maintain any interest, and hard to care about. All the commentaries above that go on about how universal this film is are deluding themselves. Likewise, all the commentary about how this is one of the greatest films of all time are not comparing it to Kurosawa's best work, which totally blow this boring soap opera away.Anyway, I rate it a three -- not totally awful -- but would never spend another 2 hours and 15 minutes of my life watching it again.",

It takes 122 minutes until a family member uses the word 'selfish'.Noriko, however, is a doting daughter-in-law; they share a gentle bond over their lost husband and son.

It appears larger than it is, and its story takes on a wider scope than is literally presented on screen. It's a film about family in the context of a rapidly changing society, the relationship between generations, and the bonds forged over lifetimes that hold people together. The story takes place in post-war Japan as an aging married couple decide to leave their small town to visit their adult children in Tokyo. Once they get there, their kids barely have time for them and struggle to keep them occupied as they juggle their professional lives, daily routines, and their own children. It's a film about the cycle of life and changing perspectives. It's about the future and the past, hope and regret. And it's ultimately a film about our mortality as human beings and the importance of the time we have. Tokyo Story is a beautiful film, shot using Ozu's signature low, motionless camera angles that lull the audience into the slow rhythm of the film. This is the definition of a timeless classic, as the themes presented in this masterpiece will remain relevant generation after generation.",

The director's genius is in how he uses the media of film to narrate life, without diluting or manipulating it. Life is depicted as is. The movie has a slow start and the first half an hour goes by without really making much of an impression. It shows daily life \u2013 chop wood, fetch water \u2013 an old couple visiting their children in big city. Everyone has busy lives, though of course, busy is how one chooses to be. Time goes where one wants it go. At the surface, the grown-up children are concerned, but it remains at the surface. There's contrasting dialog where one person says \"you can serve your parents only till the grave\" and another says \"children have their own needs\". There's really no wrong or right. Its what is. For the mother, getting the chance to sleep in the bed of her long assumed-dead son was bigger than being shown around Tokyo city. Priorities are different and keep changing. Life has a unique way of tying different threads together. Sometime, they are left untied. There's comment on how clothes take centerstage instead of the lived/shared experience. Sense of consumption and objectifying life takes away from the deeper connection and being with the experience of living life. The daughter-in-law inherits the goodwill, while the daughter takes the goods. The movie reflects on the isolation and increasing loneliness of ageing. It ends with a sense of loss, stillness and depth \u2013 all signifying old age.",

Keeping the camera static and often not following the rules Ozu focuses on the emotions and wisdom without any gimmicks. Even when the characters do selfish things Ozu never judges them, they got enough reasons to behave as they do. Each character is brimming with life that it is impossible to come out of the film without being moved and even changed.

            "content": "This film is a simple basic story, but what the film delivers to us is so much more than that. Director, Yasujir\u00f4 Ozu, uses many interesting shooting techniques for this film and this film is notable for its use of the \"tatami-mat\" shot, in which the camera height is low at floor height or eye level and remains largely static throughout. Ozu also breaks the fourth wall a lot by having the actors look straight at the camera during conversations, making this much more personal for the audience than really what the characters are feeling.Almost every shot is framed by lines, squares and angles and in almost every scene, there are fans being waived by the characters to help explain the temperature and mood of the characters. It is a basic story about an elderly couple that comes to Tokyo to catch up with their children and grandchildren, but unfortunately the family has no time to deal with the aging parents. It is a conundrum that ends up being a bad decision by the film's end.What this film delivers is a whole lot more. It reminds us about how precious our family is and how important it is to spend time with them before time runs out. It also is an amazing commentary on how important understanding history is. One of the main plot lines throughout the film, is the ever missing void that is eminent throughout, due to a son who was lost during World War II. This film was released only eight years after the war ended and that impression is felt all through the film. It is fresh on the characters minds, the filmmakers minds and eventually grips you too..If you try to put your mind into 1953 Japan you can feel the pain of the characters even though they express the pain with honor. From the looks on their faces, it feels like it is almost a second thought. It is an interesting perspective trying to put yourself in 1953, instead of looking at it from a 21st century perspective. This film is hailed as a classic. It appears on numerous top 100 lists. It is a movie that gives a great lesson on filmmaking, as well as, a history lesson and a reminder of how important family is.8.8 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

IMO Ozu made much better films. My personal favorite is THE ONLY SON with THERE WAS A FATHER a close second. Those films had two-dimensional characters. Those films had a plot. Those films had a theme. I mean, that scene in THE ONLY SON where the mother told her son that she had to sell her house to pay for his education was incredible. That whole scene was incredible with the son explaining to his mother how hard it was to find a decent job in Tokyo. So, yes, Ozu made some great films but IMO TOKYO STORY is not one of them.

            "content": "Viewed on DVD. This is a plain (shomin-geki) film ostensibly about plain (and not especially attractive) folks using a plain (impoverished) script with: plain (for the most part) acting; plain (often obscured or obscuring) sets; a plain (and often \"wandering-about\") film score; and plain (and very simple) camera work. To call this static, soporific, house-bound film a \"movie\" would be a stretch. Nothing much seems to move, and the attributes that render the motion picture a unique art form are pretty much ignored. A \"filmed pseudo stage play\" might be a more apt description. That said, the director seems to effectively reflect aspects of the contemporary trauma faced by a country whose long-standing (ancient) traditions are in the midst of serious migration in the aftermath of losing a disastrous war. Issues explored include: the ramifications of children no longer traditionally carrying for their aging parents (or wanting to); dealing with the loss of loved ones in the military service; facing rebellious (rather than obedient) children/grandchildren; living in cramped city apartments with dirty hallway; and the emergence of home-based businesses to just get by financially. The character actors who play the aging grandparents are principal weak spots. The actress playing the grandmother over wears a stoic mask; her face rarely reflects the different emotional lines she delivers. The actor who plays the grandfather is seriously miscast. He usually exhibits a goofy expression; lines reduced to continuously repeating \"pause words\" (like \"aahh\") and variations of SO DESU KA (\"really?\", \"is that so?\", etc.) don't help matters (due to an impoverished script) . Often characters are seen looking out at things which are never shown to the audience (like in a stage play). The director seems to have a fetish for clothes (including under garments) drying on laundry lines. Some scenes show only laundry drying and many scenes have laundry lines in the foreground or the background (surprisingly, there are no scenes of clothes being washed!). Subtitles and video/audio restorations are fine. Bottom line: Unless you are interested in 20th Century Japanese cultural chaos, best to skip this one. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",

I don't know if it's valid to mention some other films made on same topic in Bollywood or not because Tokyo Story came much before any other industry would think of it. It is original but still very different from other flicks based on pain of old age life because more than drama it focused on real life. Tokyo Story proved that you don't have to make it over dramatic and highly emotional to give justice to this wide appealing story. While others failed to catch the realism, Tokyo Story caught it way before and at first place. It tells the story of an aging couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their grown children. The film contrasts the behavior of their children, who are too busy to pay them much attention, with that of their widowed daughter-in-law, who treats them with kindness. At last it's all about Solitude and that's what we actually see in real life. I got confused many times while recognising the characters because their appearances were kind of quick and go but by the time it came to conclusion i was all clear about them. Acting by all the actors looked good and as i was too busy reading Subtitles i couldn't pay attention to thier expressions. Screenplay was slow till the half of the runtime but it worked like a slow poison which left impact at the end. Some Dialogues were Amazingly written which tells about how parents look at their grown childrens and what comes from the other side. Director Yasujiro Ozu kept the moral and essence alive throughout the narrative and he didn't fall lose to seek any tear-jerker sequence. Japanese Cinema was ahead of other film industries in 50s decade and Tokyo Story is just another instance for it. Overall, Tokyo Story is cinematically brilliant and stirring portrayal of old age circle which hasn't been achieved by others over the years.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "Of course that is just my opinion. Tokyo Monogatari is a marvel of the dailiness of life and the disappointment parents face. It raises relevant issues on children growing apart from their parents and a departure of values to modern times. The film is featured in many a top 10 list, its the number one film on the latest Halliwells top 1000 list. Its hard to fault.The story is about two parents who go to visit their children in Tokyo. Though things aren't as sweet as they had imagined and the trip basically ends up being a big disappointment. The story is told in an interesting manner, often eclipsing certain events and moving on. To keep the story moving I suppose. An example of this being that the old couple are meeting their son, Keizo, before they go to see their daughter. The film goes straight to arriving at the daughters house. We do not see their visiting of their son Keizo, only hear the characters talking about it and know that it has happened.One of the daughters, Shige is quite cold towards her parents. She doesn't pay much attention to them and is frequently cruel. Small things like her not giving them nice cake and saying the crackers are good enough for them. The parents slowly realise that their children aren't as successful as they had thought. Just another subtle way of indicating that they have not seen their children for some time. Also their daughters children not being familiar with their grandparents, another indicator.Eventually the old folks are shipped out to a health spa. At first they feel guilty that they are inconveniencing their children further, they don't realise that they aren't very wanted. The person most kind to the couple is Noriko, the wife of one of their sons who died in the war. It is ironic how she is the kindest, yet is no blood relation.The characters in Tokyo story are very well developed. Different assumptions can be made towards the children's indifference. Maybe times have simply changed. This is displayed well in the film through shots of modernity, trains and boats. Mod cons if you will. The camera movement in this film is also intriguing. Ozu often explores the space within a room. Maybe by following somebody around. The compositions are interesting. A lot of the camera decisions have meaning. Such as a couple sitting side by side so as not to appear confrontational. Pattern is also kept up well, people are fanning themselves in linked shots, constantly reminding the viewer that it is a hot day (common for an Ozu film) Another interesting point about the camera movement is that Ozu breaks the continuity by changing the side from which scenes are shot. A unique thing.Overall I definitely recommend you see Tokyo story, it is a very impressive, at times heartrending piece of cinema. It shows the coldness that comes with modern times and how life may not have place for elderly people. Technically, it is at a high level. The story is told in a neat way and the whole experience is generally engaging. My only complaint is that the film at time becomes a little slow and may not always be enjoyable. But overall, its an important one. Do see it if you have a big interest in film.",

The father apparently used to have quite the drinking problem, which one of the daughters had pointed out. It's not easy growing up with an alcoholic parent, and maybe there is past trauma? But because they're old(er), the parents are supposed to be saintly and revered? For all the time this movie had to explore family dynamics and dysfunction, it sure did meander where I felt burdened by the time commitment.Why do movies like this end up on \"the greatest of all time\" lists?

Shukichi Hirayama plays Ry\u00fb's wife. (Hirayama was an important Japanese actor, but she isn't linked to Ozu the way Chish\u00fb Ry\u00fb and Setsuko Hara were.)Tokyo Story is the last film of what has been called the \"Noriko Trilogy.\" It was preceded by Late Spring (1949) and Early Summer (1951). The movies are all independent, but each film features a woman named Noriko, played by Ozu's muse, Setsuko Hara.All three films deal with family dynamics. These dynamics exist within the changing world of post-war Japan. Characters adapt--or don't adapt--to the new bustling business-oriented Japan of the late 1940's and the 1950's.The story is basic. An aging couple, who live in a rural area, travel to Tokyo to visit their family members. The plot consists of the ways in which they are welcomed, and their reaction to their welcome.This movie is over 65 years old, and it has stood the test of time well.

The drama centers on the relationships of parents and adult children in a way that is both touching and still relevant. How does one go about aging gracefully? And how do children respond to aging parents? Certainly the way it is handled here is leaning on the malicious and greedy side. There's a sense of yearning for this alien presence (the parents) to be gone and to not be dealt with. It seems like such a burden and a chore to care for elders. And yet there's the silver lining of a widowed daughter-in-law (daughter-in-law!) to save the trip from complete disaster. The ending of a mother passing lingers with you. Even then there's bickering over trifling possessions that the deceased had owned. I felt angry, but also know people in my life who hold no respect for even the dead. The movie ends with Shukishi meditating. I was left to ponder how he must feel knowing that he will be left all alone and also be treated in the same way.

There stay in the houses of their children and widowed daughter-in-law, getting treated with veiled courtesy and arrogant exasperation for the burden of their presence.

And yet it feels so real. We all have those relatives that we're not so close to who nevertheless visit sometimes and the rules of society demand a certain amount of politeness. The great tragedy in this film is simply the fact that in this case these unwanted relatives are the parents of these grownup children.

It's a slow film, certainly, but it always nevertheless feels like it's moving somewhere, and then it suddenly lurches forward when something unexpected happens between scenes. The camerawork is also very stilted, but in this particular film that works wonders, detaching you from the experience of watching a movie and allowing you to focus your entire attention on the scene itself playing out.If I had to name a flaw in the film, I'd say the character of Kyoko (Kyoko Kagawa) is almost completely sidelined in favour of Noriko (Setsuko Hara), the aforementioned daughter-in-law. Kyoko is the couple's youngest daughter, who still lives in the village with them and takes care of them. Yet her kindness is barely mentioned whereas Noriko is given almost a saint-like treatment.Still, it's a good film. It requires patience from its viewers but sometimes the most captivating stories do just that.",

            "content": "This likable film has a simple story of a nice elderly couple who go to visit their daughter and son-in-law in Tokyo, but are made to feel somewhat unwelcome.This cold-shouldering is somewhat laid on with a trowel throughout, as for example when the daughter tells an enquirer that her parents are just some visiting 'friends from the country'. It was also left strangely unclear (to me at least) just why the daughter was so unwelcoming to her parents - strange since this appeared to be the central theme of the film.Nonetheless this was generally a pretty good film, and well-acted, particularly by the charming grandparents.I am however baffled as to why this has gained the reputation of being one of the greatest films ever made, frequently appearing in critics' top 10 favourite movies. After much thought, though, I have a tentative explanation:Firstly, it's a foreign language film, hence clearly an example of High Art.Secondly, it's black-and-white and somewhat flickery - this means it must be vintage, a veritable Classic in fact.And lastly, unlike most flickery black-and-white films, it's reasonably watchable. Hence this must be something quite out of the ordinary - not merely a High Art Classic, but surely a genuine Masterpiece. One of the Greatest Films Ever Made, no less. Yup, that sounds about right.",

The family seem to be tight with their money which is slowly noticed by their parents as they try to find inexpensive ways to entertain them. Plus they are too busy to spend time with them as they work during the day. The story slowly shifts to the parents reflecting upon their children and while being overly polite to the point of being evasive, they keep mentioning how they live much too far apart. Eventually, the parents decide to no longer burden their child and daughter in-law and travel home. Then children receive a somber telegram. Was there a reason the parents came to visit now? Aside from the honest drama, the camera perspective was noticeable as most of the film was shot from waist level which gives the characters a prominence and focus within the frame; as family is the focus of the film. I'd say the message this film is communicating is not to be so distant, emotionally, from your family. What should the relationship between parent and child be as they become adults?",

Yet, this picture still managed to bring truly delightful experience and gratification to me, as a person who mostly views a film as an art of very expressive sculpting of events/statement/story.First off, it perfectly emphasizes the Japanese culture of film story-telling for that era. Bringing the issue of human complexity by telling the story in a simple and delicate way is a truly exceptional way of story-telling that has been practised in Japanese filmography for a while. Development of the story is quite slow-paced and steady, that draws attention to the right aspects of the film and intensifies its main subjects.Moreover, the whole picture perfectly portrays Japanese culture, people behaviours, their understandings and way of life. It can't be unnoticed how reserved and respectful (even formal) people are among their families. Cultural side underlines and enhances the dynamic of the film, that was mentioned above. This aspect probably brings some requirements of having background knowledge and understanding of Japanese culture to have a stronger appreciation for the story development.The picture is set in post-WW2 Japan, that centres on two elderly couple, who are visiting their grown-up children in a busy city Tokyo. The plot moves around the relationship between parents and children. It figures how some simple, but rather important, behaviours, can go unseen and unnoticed. Little background stories of characters, that we are slowly getting to know, personalize them stronger and amplify how these people make in our every-day lives as well. Some aspects articulate generational conflicts as well, as we dive in some conversations among characters that focus on family discord.In General, Tokyo Story simultaneously combining all these aspects in such a wonderful way, that it has to be truly appreciated and recognized as one of the masterpieces of Japanese classics.",

The performances are, however, worth mentioning to modern viewers. I personally enjoyed it, but there is a \"stagey-ness\" to some of the acting. It can't be ignored.

The perspective of the film shots is remarkable, as we can see the actors sitting or lying on the floor most of the time - this approach allows the viewer greater access to the more intimate spheres of a Japanese house while the dialogs reveal strong emotions.

It looks like some people were bothered by the acting, but I thought it was fantastic and also natural IMO. The characters were amazing, and I just wanted to knock some sense into the adult children (whose names I've forgotten), because here we have a couple who're going to visit their children who they haven't seen for a long time, but the children don't have much time for them, so their daughter in-law has to be the kind one. One of the themes in the film, that I really loved were selfishness and also ingratitude. There was one scene that made me realize how very thankful I am to have fantastic parents and made me love them even more, and I hope I won't make the same mistake as the children, because we don't have our parents forever.There are many forms for art.

I can't say much about acting because Japanese acting and voices were new to me and couldn't understand their colloquial styles which were somehow important to display the right amount of emotions.Message: \"Anything can change overtime.\" Verdict: \"A must watch for film buffs.\"",

            "content": "Yasujiro Ozu's TOKYO STORY, while unappreciated by Western viewers during the time of its birth, is today viewed as an influential masterpiece. Taking from the gendai-geki, or \"modern story\" tradition in Japanese film, Ozu aims to emphasize the mini-actions of daily life, absent from drama, emotional complexity, and spectacle, conventions most intrinsic to Hollywood. With deceiving simplicity and genius technicality, TOKYO STORY is a timelessly important film, especially within the realm of cinematic style.Most interesting is Ozu's treatment of narrative time in TOKYO STORY. The display of several dramatic events are withheld from the viewer and replaced with mundane, everyday activity. David Desser refers to this elision in \"The Space of Ambivalence\"* as a sort of \"dailiness\" that serves as the preeminent force in moving the film. Desser notes that Ozu systematically elides everything except dailiness, forcing the viewer to fill in the gaps, or the drama, taking place between what is seen, a process calling for an active part on the audience versus the spoon-fed phenomenon seen all to often in classic Hollywood cinema. Ozu's simple approach to cinematic storytelling has cut deeply, clearing the way for the implementation of new possibilities on the global film scene. Today, many filmmakers use dailiness to emphasize importance, bridge moments in the narrative, or, simply, to give a sense of authenticity.Ozu couples his elision of dramatic narrative action with his usage of 360-degree space by ignoring the looming 180-degree rule that forces the camera to remain on one hemisphere of an imaginary circle dictated by the placement of the actors -- if the camera ventured to the other hemisphere the characters would appear to \"flip\" (and, to the horror of Hollywood, confuse the audience!). By ignoring this rule, Ozu continues in his rejection of traditional cinematic practices. He strives to move away from the Hollywood aesthetic and give viewers something fresh and interesting to look at. Desser, regarding Ozu's 360-degree space in TOKYO STORY, writes: \"Space, then, is not reducible to narrative needs, but exists as a playful and attention-grabbing component.\" Ozu wants these flips to stand out and does so with seamless blatancy unencumbered by a need for spatial continuity.TOKYO STORY is an important addition to the kaleidoscopic understanding cinematic style. Ozu's far-reaching resonance has touched the creativity of many contemporary filmmakers and is a fundamental piece of film history.*Desser, David. \"The Space of Ambivalence.\" Geiger, Jeffery and Rutsky, R.L.

It follows a couple in their late 60s traveling from a small city to Tokyo to visit two of their children and a daughter-in-law and ends with the immediate aftermath of their return to Onomichi.Shukichi (Chishu Ryu) and Tomi Hirayama (Chieko Higashiyama) had five children; the middle son died during World War II. They live with their youngest daughter, Kyoko (Kyoko Kagawa), an elementary school teacher. Their oldest son, Koichi (So Yamamura), is a doctor in Tokyo, married to the outspoken Fumiko (Kuniko Miyake). Their older daughter, Shige (Haruko Sugimura), is a busy hairdresser. The widowed daughter-in-law, Noriko (Setsuko Hara), works in a busy commercial office. Their middle son, Keizo (Shiro Osaka), seems to work for a railroad company in Osaka, halfway between Onomichi and Tokyo.The film follows the interaction Shukichi and Tomi have with their Tokyo family. Noriko, by far the movie's most empathetic character, is the only one to make much time for them. They decide to return home sooner than planned, and Tomi begins to experience health issues on the way. A final crisis brings everyone to Onomichi.This film is an understated examination of family relationships in postwar Japan. Increasing Western influences are evident in the younger women's dress and incidents like Keizo wanting to return to Osaka for a baseball match. It provides a very engaging insight into early 1950s Japanese care for critically ill persons and rituals for death. The simple camera style has similarities to the film, \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles\"",

But when things start clicking, when I finally start to understand what's being conveyed and contrast here, I'm just hooked in on the modernized and Westernized city, the kind and forgiving, as well as the selfish, and the distances between characters, between family generations. I start to see my family in it, and like Kyoko, vow to never be like that. The use of non-Hollywood style and techniques is worth highlighting too, representing what's called the transcendental style. The non-melodramatic - characters always smiling, major plot points happening behind the camera - truly makes the style unique, not forcing but sharing emotions with the audience. The slow pacing and gives time for me to contemplate, and ultimately brings a sense of zen to the film. All in all, a masterpiece.",

Filial piety cannot reach beyond the grave.\" The story of this film is simple, much like the other Ozu film I've seen Good Morning, an old couple come to the city to visit their children and grandchildren. Their children are busy, and the old people upset their routines. As the old man remarks near the end of the film, the person who treats them best, their widowed daughter-in-law (portrayed by the mesmerizing Setsuko Hara in surely one of the greatest performances of all time) isn't even related to them by blood. Their grandchildren barely pay them any attention. There's a beautiful scene when the Grandmother and her youngest Grandchild, whom she has never met go for a walk. The child ignores his Grandmother's questions and runs around. In a quiet way, without anyone admitting it, the visit goes badly. There isn't much else to say, but the film is like an emotional atom bomb. The scene at the end where the old couple release all they have kept under the surface throughout the whole journey is magnificent. They express their disappointment in their children. They think their daughter isn't nice and are also surprised by their son's lowly job. In the end, they agree that their children are simply \"better than average\". The heartbreaking thing about this film is how well it expresses the disappointment of life and how life goes on, illustrated by the final shot of the rooftops of the town and a boat passing by on the water. Just brilliant, brilliant stuff.",

Namely because not all dull things can be described as artistic.\nThe movie reflects on a rather universal topic - kids drifting apart from their parents, which become quite a nuisance to them. It's a story told many times, due to its universality, since everybody can find themselves in any side of the story - whether as kids or the parents. It's also nice to reflect upon yourself, comparing to the characters and the story line, drawing comparisons to your respective everyday lives and people.\nHowever, this movie gives opportunity for neither of those.\nThe thing that struck me the most is lack of emotion throughout the movie, and even where reflected, it is so indescribably fake and hard-to-believe.\nOf course, I don't mean to be disrespectful, especially acknowledging the difference in emotion expression in western and eastern Asian culture. However, this is not the case, especially comparing to other Japanese movies from this era.\nTo sum up, a complete waste of time, you can invest in some other movie, which would not make you think that you should not even watch black-and-white movies any more.",

This may seem to be the body of the film, but in fact, it's merely exposition for the stunning final half hour.Tokyo Story is about life itself and it comments on the human condition with an eloquence that will keep any willing viewer enthralled. Ozu may not share Kurosawa's flowing mise-en-scene or Mizoguchi's objective portrayal of human suffering, but he is, to my mind, the greatest of Japanese directors.

While all are well meaning and polite, the years and the miles between them have taken them all on different paths and they struggle to come to terms with their memories and their expectations.CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER: Intimacy and how things change. A character study of the the differences between generations, their expectations (both young and old) and how the modern world has fractured the extended family.PROS AND CONS: This is a slice of life / contemplation film as opposed to the fantasy / escapism film genre that is marketed to the youth of today. While many newer films have choreographed violence and action as the mainstay of their cinema experience, this film is the opposite. While film is a 'visual' medium, it can be a subtle medium as well, without all the 'eye-candy' and special effects that are so prominent today.This film is long, over 2 hours, and it took me a while to get all the way through it. By the end of the film, I felt as though I was a part of this family and could sense their pain and grief . This film may not appeal to younger generations, but as we age, this type of cinema becomes more and more endearing to those of us that have experienced more than we allow ourselves to remember.There are some interesting oddities in the film that stem from the culture in which it was made. All the camera angles are very low, usually less than 3 feet from the floor. Since there were few chairs in 1950s Japan, most of the characters sit on the floor. This is their living space, hence the lower camera angle. Almost everyone in the film has a hand fan, which they are constantly fanning themselves with. In a time before air-conditioning, this was the only way to keep cool in the summer. There is almost no panning on scanning with the camera. Most of the scenes are done with a static camera location with minimal scene editing. Finally, there are a lot of 'lingering' scenes, in which actors leave the frame or exit a room, but the camera keeps rolling for up to 10 seconds before fading to the next scene or editing to a different location. This appears intentional, as though the director wants to let us linger on what has just transpired.In the end this is a film that makes you think. I love films that do that.",

            "content": "I saw \"Tokyo Story\" for the first time back in the 1970's.  I recently saw the film again and became interested in the life of its director Yasujiro Ozu.  According to my brief research, Ozu is considered to be one of the greatest Japanese filmmaker of the 20th century.  During the 1930's, he fought as a front-line soldier of the Japanese Imperial Army in China. After a discharge from the Army, he was re-conscripted in the 1940's by the Japanese Army to make propaganda films.  He was a life-long bachelor who was apparently a hard-drinking but functioning alcoholic.  Toward the end of his life, he had to drink several pints of sake just to start the day.  Even though he was a hard working filmmaker, he was also a life-long party animal who partied really, really hard.  He could be rather bad-tempered.  When he was young, he got into trouble after punching a waiter at his studio's commissary.  In spite of his drinking and bad-temper, Ozu was worshipped by many Japanese actors and actresses.  He made many masterpieces, including \"Tokyo Story,\" `Equinox Flower,' and \"Floating Weeds,\" before his untimely death from cancer in 1963.  Even though Ozu admired the works of his more internationally known younger colleague Akira Kurosawa, in terms of filmmaking Ozu and Kurosawa were diametric opposites.  While Kurosawa's style was considered to be very different from a typical Japanese filmmaking style, Ozu was considered to be the most Japanese of all Japanese movie directors.  In spite his very Japanese filmmaking style, Ozu in many ways was similar to the Swedish genius Ingmar Bergman.  Just like Bergman, Ozu rarely relied on overt violence in his movies and cherished scripts with greater delicacy and subtlety than Kurosawa.  While Kurosawa made different kinds of movies (i.e. samurai movies, detective stories, war movies, social statement movies), Ozu was very limited in the kind of movies he made.  Towards the end of his life, Ozu only made movies about the everyday lives of typical Japanese middle-class families.  This is due to the difference in the way the two masters tried to depict humankind.  While Kurosawa tried to study humankind by portraying different kinds of human being (i.e. samurais, criminals, police detectives, soldiers, paupers, corrupted politicians, semi-senile old men), Ozu in his artistic maturity confined himself to making films about average middle-class Japanese.  In doing so, Ozu tried to find something universal to all human beings of different races and cultures in the lives of typical middle-class Japanese families.   \"Tokyo Story\" is a prime example of Ozu's mature style. To be honest, I was worried before I checked the comments about \"Tokyo Story\" on the IMDb site. I thought the modern movie audience, who grew up with Arnold Schwarznegger, Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris shoot-them-up movies, cannot appreciate or even comprehend this subtle work of art.  To my pleasant surprise, numerous people saw this movie, and many of them had positive opinions about this sine qua non by the Japanese master Ozu.   SLIGHT SPOILER HERE.  IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ, JUMP TO ***.  In this movie, Ozu portrayed the life of a typical middle-class Japanese family consisting of aging parents and their adult children.  The adult children act selfishly and callously toward their own parents while the daughter-in-law shows heart-warming tenderness.  The complexity of parents-children relationship, a theme applicable to all races and cultures, is depicted with great mastery and subtlety. *** As one IMDb commentator stated, this movie might be too quiet and slow for the MTV generation; however, this movie has a deep insight and masterful depiction of human nature which are often lacking in modern American movies. As a front line soldier during the Sino-Japanese conflict of the 1930's, Ozu must have seen first hand numerous carnage far worse than anything depicted in modern American action films.  However, Ozu did not need Chuck Norris' Uzi or Schwarznegger's grenades to express what he wanted to say. With his famed minimalist camera technique, which is reminiscent of Japanese haiku poems, he fully stated what he wanted to say quietly and masterfully. `Tokyo Story' is indeed a timeless masterpiece.",

My wife says it fairly often. \"Shikata-ganai\" seem to be more like \"life sux and then you die\". My wife doesn't say that and nobody says that in Tokyo Story. This movie is a dilemma, sort of like the dilemma discussed while they're drinking ... how it is tough to live with your kid but tough for them to be gone. This movie? As oka-san says about her kids \"certainly better than average\". And in Lake IMDBgone, average is about a 6.5, so I give this an 8. The problem? Tokyo Story is both literally and figuratively BLACK & WHITE. It is a simple movie. Even the dialogue is simple. How simple? I speak Japanese worse than kindergarten level, but I could understand most of what the older generation said. They talked slowly. They used simple grammar, polite forms, and simple words. So, I empathize with the commentator who panned it. Yeah, I also knew everything that would happen after 20 minutes of viewing. If I hadn't spent a lot of time in Japan and have Japanese in-laws, i.e. if I had little to no interest in Japan, I might feel similar and not even have watched the whole thing. (In this way, it is almost like Lost in Translation.) I mean, if you have little to no interest in Japan, it is neither very entertaining nor very revealing. Come on, you have to be pretty baka to not understand generational gaps and the damage done to family life by modern society. Well, duh! Having said all that, the message is well-done, it is universal, and who knows, maybe seeing it in a different time and place will add something for you even if all you know about Japan is Sony and Toyota.

Still, the movie is highly rated in Japan as well so that at least gives some support to idea that it's not just this otherness that's making people like this movie, unlike many other Japanese movies that are liked in the west but not in Japan itself. That said, I did enjoy seeing Tokyo in the 50s pre air conditioning and everyone is sweating like crazy.The style of having each actor look directly into the camera and speak their lines makes the entire thing feel very unnatural and staged. This same problem plagues other movies by the same director. Instead of filming people having a conversation each person was filmed delivering their lines separately and then the results were spliced together resulting in a extremely stiff and unnatural style.As much as I didn't find the movie amazing the basic story did stick with me more than most. It all comes down to the last lines which is that people have their own lives and people outside of the immediate family often don't really have time for anyone else. In other words, mom and dad might have time for their kids and each other but they have no time for grandpa and grandma. They've got jobs and/or other obligations. There is no judgement in that.

When I come \"home\" with my own family to visit my parents (it happens every 3 years or so) I recognize the situations in TM. \u0085We are just as close as family, but in some cases as far as acquaintances, too\u0085 Other universal things like egocentricity, discussions about money, how to organize things without hurting someone's feeling, match our own needs with customs, etc.. are the tools Ozu used to reach us, so simple but so effective.I don't agree with the notion that Ozu had not made a moralized, stereotypical message with TM: it is obvious that Ozu let us seen what he considered the greatest value in human quality, namely the will and the skill to take care of others, much more than ourself. Watch Kyoko and Noriko, the 2 Cinderella's, do their little \"things\" almost invisible in order to keep the family happening going smoothly. Although Ozu didn't \"speak\" directly for himself, I can feel his strong hidden message through the words of Tomi and Shukishi Hirayama. This is what I call the art of passing a value through a story.The most melodramatic and meditative moment come in at the end of the film when Noriko and Kyoko communicated the characteristics of life at such deep, simple and short manner (typical Japanese way). There is a kind of psychological climax despite of the most hearing comment about Ozu's \"monochrome\" way of telling stories by avoiding dramatic high and low ends, that is: trying to leave the audience creates their own drama's by providing the chances to do so.The film ended with a hopeful open end: Noriko and Kyoko will meet again in Tokyo (soon). Life goes on \u0085 like the train which brings Noriko back to her own life in Tokyo, leaving Noriko spotting the train from her classroom window. The beautiful smile in Noriko's face is overwhelming and paradoxical at the same time, especially when she profoundly mentioned that life is full of disappointments.The only thing I still want to ask Ozu: why using a Western-looked actress to portray Noriko, which I consider to be the leading role ? Having said so, I realize that TM has no one leading role.",

There are older films with better visual quality(technically speaking), but the shots are imbued with imagination and restraint.I found my concentration wavering during the first half hour. Nothing seemed to be happening, and I was mentally scribbling a '5' for Tokyo story. But then my curiosity was piqued. I wanted to know what was going to happen to the main two characters. By the time the plot became evident I was hooked. The minutes passed quickly by, and at the end I was surprised that the film exceeded two hours.I was very satisfied with the way this film reveals itself without being too blatant. There is a certain honest subtlety about Tokyo Story that compels me to show respect for Ozu's effort. I am now eager to try more of his filmography.

            "content": "Tokyo Story is a beautiful, emotionally devastating film that really shows a side of society that immensely disappoints me. I guess you can say that I developed an instant personal connection to this film, since I've witnessed similar situations. Having to go through the immense lost of my grandfather (who was not only my grandfather, but someone who I can call my dad and my best friend) and knowing for a fact I will be missing him for the rest of my life until I die, I felt greatly disgusted by how a lot of the children in the film treated their parents. I come from a culture where we would NEVER put our parents or grandparents in an old person's home, and we would be more than willing to take care of the people who raised us just the same way they took care of us. If I have to make sacrifices in my job and my me time, then I would make no hesitation, because I LOVE, as well as RESPECT my grandparents/parents. Whatever differences we may have wouldn't even matter and in the end it never did. Not to trying to tell anyone how to live, but I think that showing some compassion and respect towards the people who did a lot for you shows a lot of character. My grandfather may not be with me now, but to know that I did the best that I could to make him happy and not feel alone gives me a sense of comfort in knowing that he was happy.We unfortunately live in a society where we all are too busy and have places to be, and it sometimes cannot be avoided, but once we deliberately start to distance ourselves from people, then it becomes a problem, especially for the people we should give more time and attention to. This is the me generation, and we are flooded by technology and corporations trying to exploit many aspects of our lives, which dilutes so many of the basic, yet most important aspects of our humanity. A film like this just goes to show that our so called leaders in society don't put much of an effort in influencing us to stay connected or in at least trying to create outlets that will bring us closer as humans. Instead we live in a system that brings out selfishness. While life can be at times unrestrained in its cruelty, at least we have movies like 'Tokyo Story' that shows a sense of humanity in its most raw and purest form. I like to watch films to escape, but especially ones that show an utmost honesty about our society and what 'Tokyo Story' says to me from watching it is that while life is beautiful and still worth living, it can still be immensely disappointing. What makes Tokyo Story such a strong film is that it brings out the harsh reality that exists in our society, in that many people don't put in any effort to maintain the strength of a bond towards their family. What's the point of being part of a family if that person doesn't even have the heart to set things aside to spend time with their parents? The fact that this film can tug at many people's heart strings goes to show just how much this film is an emotional punch to the gut, in that it shows aspects of human nature that is far reaching and universal. While Japan is one of the many diverse cultures in our world, we still share many of the same issues that can exist in any family relationship. Any film that make me feel this much empathy for its characters is something special and 'Tokyo Story' is that special film.",

The weighted themes on death and the separation of children from parents, and the clearly fractured relationships between characters, are ripe for the screens of your next soap opera; yet it is handled so delicately, so subtly, that for a large portion many may complain there isn't drama enough.Parents take a long train journey to visit their adult children in Tokyo. Their children are for the most part polite and accommodating, yet so busy with employment they are unable to spend any quality time together, and privately view their parents presence as a burden. The pace is unhurried, and to the detriment of entertainment, conversations are carried out with a realistic mundane-ness. As the selfishness behind the facade of mannered conversation is slowly revealed, this approach becomes a powerful tool to reflect on the sadder aspects of family relations. And where typical melodramas may rush to have characters verbalise their upset, and make a mockery of it in the process, Tokyo Story manages to reveal that upset in a manner largely unspoken, and far more evocative because of it. With the films title, and many location cutaways, the younger generations busyness and neglect of their elders in a large city may also be seen as a metaphor for modern life's alienation and neglect of values. They do not mean harm, but Tokyo Story shows its heart by being a melancholy display on what is lost.All things considered, Tokyo Story is an ode to cherish human relationships, and a critique on human frailty and modern life. It is a sad and touching film, but meanders very slowly, particularly at the beginning.",

We have a backward view of change and progress not necessarilly being soOzu shot the film from a waist height viewpoint, which to the traditional Japanese viewer respresents the view of someone below eye level sitting on a mat. This was the pose of the onlooker, and this constantly reminds us that the film is under the gaze, and we should take note. Like traditional Japanese cinema the camera does not move.

You're expecting to simply be a foreign witness to something exotic from a time past you cannot really understand (unless I guess you're a Japanese national from that era) but the parents provide surprising feedback and emotion, and this is beautiful nuanced top notch acting. Going into this a long time ago I though this was a feudal era piece so I was expecting the traditional clothing etc loll. It's all old but modern and those people got style. Sometimes you have to go very very far away (in my case) in order to find something very close. A movie which discusses age and family and makes you think about the quality of our interactions with people from different generations. It is a universal masterpiece because I'm not Japanese and none of the setting applies to what I am or what I live, but I can connect with the humanity that drives this amazing production.

The movie was essentially anti-American propaganda depicting the woes of Western civilization.  Furthermore, this movie was about an hour too long.  It had an overwhelming number of screen-shots of either smokestacks or nature scenes (west vs. east), and the smokestacks seemed inherently evil and very ominousing.

This 1953 masterpiece depicts an older couple living in country side Japan visiting their children in Tokyo. As they visit their family they receive colder welcomes than expected with the exception of an exceptional, widowed daughter in law. Yasujiro Ozu manages to paint a rather unsettling portrait of post-war life in Tokyo with a strong disconnect from family and a hopeless feeling of loneliness as the couple drifts in the overwhelming landscape of Tokyo. It's obvious great care was taken into the script by the authentic dialogue and humanistic tone of the scenes. The film beautifully explores themes like younger vs older generation gaps, meaning of life in contrast of war, loneliness, and the roles of children and parents.It's not easy examining a clear cut story structure but the story seems to be the daughter in law's story as she fills the slot of the audience as an observer watching the family treat each other. Yet, enough character payoff happens to allow some catharsis. While the structure is hard to examine, Tokyo Story feels as complete and thorough as any film can be. Anyone looking for a deeper and methodical character piece, Tokyo Story is not only highly recommended, it's an incredible study that gets better as each viewing passes and more time passes to mentally digest the film's depth. While it may not appeal to everyone, it most certainly is study reference material for any would be filmmaker on several narrative levels.",

I've enjoyed silent films and \"art\" films, but this 2+ hour long examination of an elderly couple visiting the big city of Tokyo to visit many of their children and in-laws was painful to watch. I clicked on the \"spoiler alert\" box but there is really nothing that can be spoiled: the plot is so \"everyday life of ordinary people\" that there is no suspense at any point in the movie. The parents are very simple people and speak simply, often only affirming or negating a question by saying \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"is that right?\" So there is nothing resembling sterling dialogue. No, it is a character study of relationships among the family that carries on interminably.What was odd to me was how unconcerned their children were about the visit and how little they were willing to sacrifice in time for their parents even as the trip must have been long-prepared. Perhaps the cognitive dissonance of my associating Asian cultures with respecting the elderly (if not their parents!) was surprising to me. Most people would have treated elderly strangers with more consideration. Their indifference was almost painful to watch. It was almost as if the director wanted to make the children as selfish and negligent as possible and exaggerated their flaws.The cinematography was excellent but it, too, seemed odd as if beautiful scenic shots were interspersed among the tight interior shots where the sparse dialogue was taking place. It did break up the monotony of the first-grade level vocabulary and dialogue.Give me the weakest Kurosawa any day over this.

            "content": "There are different reasons films become classics. Some because their imagery is burned into the memory's eye indelibly, others because the characters are unforgettable, still others because they blazed a new trail in the art form. Tokyo Story claims its distinction among lovers of world cinema largely due to its quietly revolutionary social material, as well as some indelible images: the view of the hill with the little figures of the grandmother and her grandson playing for example, like an animated version of one of those classic tiny bamboo sculptures encased in glass. To name only one beautifully framed shot. At the time it was made, 1953, to depict wilful and disrespectful behaviour by the grandchildren as shown here would have been shocking to traditional viewers. Likewise, the indifference bordering on disrespect shown by the old couple's children. Ever so gradually the carefully cultivated mask of social ritual is stripped away to reveal that even the dutiful daughter-in-law admits to being more selfish than she appears. The intense difficulty of family members having any real connection at all with each other is deeply driven home. And the irony that a non-blood relative is actually the one who cares most for the old folks. This, combined with the choice of a storyline that deliberately avoided heroic or mythic overtones as might have been expected in Japanese cinema at the time, accounts for the social impact this film would have made in 1953. (Keep in mind that Kirosawa's early masterpiece The Seven Samurai was released just the next year, sustaining the mythic-heroic tradition of Japanese literature on film.) The breakneck speed at which films are now made provides a glaring contrast to this nearly 60-year-old film, whose rhythm is placidly riverine. Yet even to someone like myself with an appreciation for foreign films, the pace occasionally drags. If anything, Tokyo Story is an anti- heroic film. Still, it's a reminder that current film entertainment\u2014with the exception of films like Terence Malick's Tree of Life\u2014allows the viewer no time whatsoever to meditate on deeper themes. Tokyo Story reminds us that films can be long prayers rather than a constant concussion of thunderclaps. It confronts the most basic issues that confront us all: family and mortality.",

For instance, while the elderly parents were treated rather shabbily by their children in Tokyo, how can we find them (the children) at fault when the parents were so dull and malleable? Am I supposed to feel sympathy for them or merely observe? Even when they went away to the spa, they seemed like strangers to each other. Not knowing Japanese customs it was, of course, odd to see so little affection between family members. Also, is there a gay theme here? Was the widowed daughter-in-law still unremarried because she didn't want a man. The closest thing to affection was when the kindly daughter-in-law left the old man's home and bid goodbye to the young female schoolteacher, his caretaker. Before the movie ends the teacher wanders to her classroom window to watch the girl's train pass by. There seems to be a romantic melancholy in this scene out of keeping with any other segment of this wonderful film. Am I seeing something that was never there?",

While parents fear dying alone, children fear having the burden of aging parents. TOKYO STORY never lets you forget this.Ozu's style is interesting, avoiding scenes that an American director would have milked for maximum dramatic effect, and preferring to focus on the aftermath instead. The tone is so even, and the film so long, many are likely to find it a tad exasperating. Patient viewers will be rewarded, as the layers of this family are uncovered (the reunited fathers, all in a saki buzz, revealing their disappointments with their children, remains my personal favorite scene).

By this I mean that instead of the usual Hollywood/Western 180\u00ba Ozu utilizes a spherical space. When the old mother tells her widowed daughter-in-law how much she enjoys her visit the daughter-in-law is initially screen right. Noriko massages Tomi's shoulders and then she stands to cross the room. In a typical Western film this would be a cut on action, the action 'disguising' the cut. Ozu cuts on her motion too but at the same time shifts the camera across the 180\u00ba line. Thus, when the cut on Noriko's motion is completed she is now screen left.Penelope Gilliatt has written that Ozu is obsessed with film's possibility of \"reporting the poetic truth of the actual\" and I cannot think of a better way to express his desire and success to extract beauty from the mundane, the very day, the quotidian, with love and humanity..",

            "content": "Minimalism is a prominent technique employed by director Yasujiro Ozu throughout his 1953 film: Tokyo Story. By not using optical devices such as swipes, fades, or dissolves Ozu created a very passionate and believable film by following a strict and effective realist formula. Tokyo Story deals with the feelings of family estrangement while Shukichi and Tomi struggle to adapt the change of culture and the disaffection of their children they were so eager to see. The characters feelings reflected in the film are so convincing it's obvious that Ozu had a clear understanding of human behavior and the tribulations that occur inside family life.One of the most important aspects of Tokyo Story is Ozu's camera work. Nearly all indoor shots were taken from the same angle. Since the camera would be placed three to four feet off of the ground the film had a very realistic feel, because of this the audience in a way was on the same level as the characters in frame. The low angles also accentuate the feeling of being in an enclosed house, so when the outdoor shots make their appearances (the long shots of the city and landscapes) they seemed so much more vast and beautiful in contrast to the low angle filming of the previous scenes.The placement of the camera during the characters conversations is simplistic and yet at the same time different from most other jump-cut filming techniques employed by other directors. It gives the viewer an outside feeling, the audience in a way become observers of the characters dialogue and feelings. In a lot of scenes the people in frame also talk directly into the camera, this is normally not a prominent technique in films but in Tokyo Story it gives the scene a more noticeable and expansive feel. Had the scenes been filmed in a more conventional style (both characters conversing in the same frame) the dialogue and emotions would be less noticeable to the viewer. Tokyo Story is a very subtle and bittersweet film, it was important for Ozu to employ interesting camera techniques because the exchanges and expressions amongst the characters are a key element to the plot development.Ozu's minimalist techniques make Tokyo Story a very realistic and sometimes emotionally profound film. While not using any moving camera Ozu captures some very attention getting images, one in particular is when Mrs. Hirayama is watching her estranged grandson pick blades of grass outside of her son's house. This scene has a very somber aura surrounding it and it is conveyed in a very subtle way. Another memorable part is when Mr. Hirayama is sitting on the ledge in front of the ocean after a restless night in the noisy spa his kids thoughtlessly send them too. The feelings of abandonment are clearly expressed without any real expletives incorporated in the scene. This approach works perfectly well when telling the story of an elderly couple's sense of detachment from their children. The feelings of sadness and abandon are prominent throughout the film but they are never imposed on the viewer, the encompassing ambiance of emotion is a quiet and affectionate way to tell a story. All the emotions are underlying within the characters as well. When Koichi has to go on call to visit a patient before they go out for the day its not as if his father stands up and says, \"I am upset that we cant go out\", he quietly accepts the situation. Unlike the intrusive style of modern films Yasujiro gives credit to the audience to reach their own conclusions about the films elements. Instead of having one dimensional characters who pout and fuss at every altercation Ozu inserted believable people who react realistically to a problem. Had this film been made to meet the standards of the dumbed down culture of modern day there would probably be a mindless scene were Mr. and Mrs. Hirayama sit down in a room and discuss how they feel as if they've grown apart from their kids, (as if the series of events in the film weren't clear enough already). There is a genuine awareness of audience credibility Yasujiro Ozu had while making Tokyo Story.The social statement is not only told in the film but it is also evident in the style of it as well. A big part of Tokyo Story's message is that life is not supposed to be some on going hustle. The two most admirable characters are clearly Mr. and Mrs. Hirayama and they were the only ones who seemed to understand that. They just could not adapt to the \"quick fix\" lifestyle that their children ended up living in. Their fast paced career is, in a way what ended up being the break down of their family unit. Even when Shukichi and Tomi tried to embrace city life it brought out their less desirable qualities. For example the father goes out and gets drunk with some of his old friends.This message is also evident in the film itself by it's slowed down pace, granted one has to be patient at first to get used to Ozu's style but in order to appreciate certain things one shouldn't always be in a hurry to get to the end of something. When someone falls into the standards of modern society they overlook what is important in life, and that is to take some time aside and appreciate what's around you. When Shukichi dies it's as if everyone masks their self resentment by scuttling back to their busy lives in Tokyo. The only character who seems to be content is Tomi. That is because he had led a fulfilled life with his spouse and seemed to have little to no regret.",

Ozu great grip on the drama in his film is remarkably great here in Tokyo Story. Few directors have had the genius of do it as Ozu. The family drama form of Tokyo Story is great, but not only because of great direction, but also because of great acting and a great script. Tokyo Story deals with something that was not familiyar with the 1950's cinema, and certainly not Hollywood at that time. But Japanese cinema was very different.

His interest lies in some other place. This is further shown as there is a train framed right behind him, which is a metaphor for the change in society over generations.Notice also how the factory chimneys first emit white smoke to show that everyone is happy and later black smoke to foreshadow grandmas death. What is even more heartbreaking is that the entire family sits around the table happily together after grandma's death, something that didn't happen before - and that is only staged.And this film goes much deeper than just purely illustrating the message that in life you should be grateful and kind to your loved ones - it also touches on other themes, such as fear of being a burden to others, disappointment, guilt and selfishness. The selfish think that other people are selfish, and those who aren't selfish think that they are.I believe this is one of the best movies of all time and therefore can highly recommend it.",

To really appreciate this movie one must put into perspective the value of family, especially one's elders, in eastern cultures. Even today it is so different from our Western views and approaches in dealing with our elders.The basic principle there is respect for elders, or even reverence for one's parents as they get on with age. Many families continue to live with their parents and care for them through their old age. These are the choices they make in their life and value. And, not to forget, many of these people are professionals and skilled laborers who continue to work full-time and still care for their extended families. Rarely will you find a retirement village ;) there.Remember these simple concepts next time you watch this movie and you might get a poignant view of the pain that is conveyed in this fantastic film.Enjoy.....",

            "content": "I often wonder how recent films struggle to get there themes across to an audience in a believable and natural way, when films in the past have done it so successfully. Which lead me Tokyo Story, the film's moral message is quite easy to point out and easy to follow but it's the subtleties of die dialogue, direction and acting that really make it significant in the way that it communicates the theme to the audience. Let me explain.When watching the first view scenes of the film the acting really through me off. The characters would smile at each other in every shot without missing a beat. It creates an almost unsettling feeling in the viewer, making the characters feel like their hiding something sinister, masked by the smile. I first thought that this was the actors overacting and that it was unintentional from a directorial stand point. But as the film carries on and you pay closer attention to subtle changes in their face and smile, you notice the characters processing various different emotions, which they hide behind this mask. The Parents are particularly well versed in hiding their true emotions. But it's when they talk to Noriko (the daughter in law) about her late husband, when you start to see Noriko's mask crumble away. This makes the characters more complex, causing the viewers to relate and sympathize with them even more.Which is one off the many reasons Tokyo Story does such a spectacular job at communicating it's theme, anyone can relate to wanting to see your family and spend time with them, but it takes a master director and amazing actors to perfectly simulate the way we hide our true emotions from our family members, in order to avoid starting a fight in the limited time you have with them.I would highly recommend this film to anyone, and regard it as an essential piece of cinema to anyone film scholar. It's also worth noting that there are various techniques I didn't discuss in the review that add to the film's overall experience and theme that are worth discussing.",

The film expresses that with showing an old couple visit their children, and you could think that it's not enough to base a film around but somehow Tokyo Story make it look so simple and deliver it so perfectly. That's one of the reasons that make this film so special. Another thing is how its made, the film is of course very old and the way of filming was sourly very different back then. The film is so casual and something other films don't tend to include or think about to include is well built-in in this film, and it's those little things which make it so special. I also think this film could not be made again the same way nor some other way then it did, it just so perfect with the time period, the culture, the characters, the atmosphere, etc. But the film still has so much reflection of the reality and maybe more than ever.",
