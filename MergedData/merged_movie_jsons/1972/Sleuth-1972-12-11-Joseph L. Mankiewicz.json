            "content": "In England, the Italian English hairdresser Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) is invited by the successful writer of detective stories Andrew Wyke (Laurence Olivier) to visit his isolated house. The lower class Milo is the lover of Andrew's wife, who is used to have a comfortable life, and he intends to marry her. Andrew proposes Milo to steal his jewelry simulating a burglary. Milo would make a fortune selling the jewels to an intermediary; and Andrew would be reimbursed by the insurance company and would not pay alimony. However, the whole situation was part of an evil game. When Milo vanishes, a detective visits Andrew to investigate what really happened that night, when deadly games are disclosed.\"Sleuth\" proves that a great screenplay, an outstanding director, two top-notch actors and four scenarios suffice to make an excellent movie with four nominations to the Oscar. The intelligent and wit theatrical story has amazing lines and twists in a duel of cat and mouse between two icons, and has not aged. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Trama Diab\u00f3lica\" (\"Diabolic Plot\")",

A filmed version of Anthony Shaffer's own wonderful stage play, the brilliance needed to sustain 138 minutes attention between just two people in three or four rooms of a single house - should not be underestimated. Olivier is in his element as the upper crust land-owner who invites Alfie-esque hairdresser Caine to his mansion, simply to acknowledge his wife's infidelity with him and to inform Caine that he is messing with the wrong guy. The dialog driven plot is probably beyond the grasp of most younger viewers, but is a veritable revelation for those seeking to be entertained on a grand scale. As important a player as anyone else, the house itself and its many wondrous artifacts are simply stunning. How the tables are turned and the roles reversed? Without doubt, one of the greatest films ever made.As for Alex Cawthorne's stunning performance as Inspector Doppler, what can I say?  Its almost as is he wasn't there!",

            "content": "Sleuth is based on an outstanding stage play by Anthony Shaffer. Sometimes, a work which succeeded on the stage doesn't transfer well to the big screen. Movies like Equus and Dangerous Corner - which were a delight in theatres - lose their power under the close scrutiny of a film camera. Sleuth is not a failure. It retains its stagebound plot, characters and dialogue, but somehow manages to be totally engrossing as well. Part of the joy is due to Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. The two giants of Britsh acting don't chew the scenery in an attempt to out-shine each other; they complement each other quite brilliantly and turn in two of the finest screen performances you could ever aspire to see. Olivier plays elderly author Andrew Wyke, an obscenely wealthy, well-educated and devious man. Caine is Milo Tindle, a charming, ever-polite young hairdresser. Milo visits Andrew to ask for his blessing in marrying his estranged wife. Although Andrew seems fairly open to the idea of giving away his wife (after all, they despise each other) he still feels stung by her exit, so he engineers a cruel game to humiliate Milo. But who is playing a trick on who? The dialogue is terrific, but it needed terrific actors to get the best out of it. Caine and Oloivier do a fine job. Ken Adams' set design turns Olivier's gorgeous palatial house into a dazzling mansion of madness. The tinkly music by John Addison creates a playful yet ever-so-slightly uncomfortable mood. Joseph L. Mankiewicz directs perfectly, getting maximum suspense from his staging of scenes and thoughtful choice of camera angles. The twists are superbly disguised, especially the awesome \"shock\" climax which will blow you away. See Sleuth - it's one of the best!",

            "content": "Sleuth is, without doubt, one of the finest thrillers ever made. It continually keeps you on the edge of your seat and you never truly know where you are. This is an excellent thing for a thriller to do as it ensures that you will keep watching for that all important next plot development. The plot itself follows a man named Andrew (played by Lawrence Olivier) who is a big fan of playing games. He invites the man that has run off with his wife; Milo (Michael Caine) to his house, and while there, he entices him into a plot to steal his wife's jewels so that he can avoid the taxman, and so that Caine can accommodate his new found girlfriend's overly expensive tastes. To give anything else of the plot away would be running the risk of spoiling what is a fascinating piece of cinema, so I will leave the plot details at that. The plot meanders in a way that is hard to pin down; the film remains ambiguous all the way through; nothing is ever what it seems, and that is what makes Sleuth a cut above many detective mysteries.This movie stars two super-heavyweights of the British movie industry; Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine. The film requires the two to be on screen for nearly the full duration of the movie, so it is obviously essential that they perform to a high standard; and I can confirm they most certainly do just that. The chemistry between the two is outstanding. The way that the sublime dialogue bounds back and fourth between the two is simply a pleasure to watch; and is more entertaining than a lot of movies that are made simply for entertainment purposes. The two do have a tendency to get a bit dramatic at times, there's is a particular sequence in the cellar that springs to mind immediately on that front; but the over-dramatics add to the atmosphere of the film. The film is very different and over the top in it's style anyway; it plays out almost like a moving detective novel, and the fact that both actors have a tendency to camp it up gives the movie something that it would not have had otherwise. The film is based on a stage play by Anthony Shaffer, and this is evident throughout the movie as it plays out just like a stage play on the big screen. The only film that I can think of that is similar to Sleuth in this way is Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rope'. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who also made the classic All About Eve, very astutely directs this film. I would even go as far as to say that the direction here is better than it was in All About Eve; Joseph L. Mankiewicz's use of the camera is amazing and you can tell throughout the film that this is an auteur at the absolute top of his game. Overall, Sleuth is one of the best films ever made. It is amazing just how brilliant a film can be with a miniscule cast and a brilliant script, and if only for that fact alone; Sleuth is a film that you need to see.",

            "content": "My parents saw \"Sleuth\" on Broadway, during its original run, just a year or so before this film was released.  Watching the movie I can see how it would make a good play, but by the same token, it is not a translation that feels slow, or wordy, or unsuited to the screen.  The adaptation is excellent, without \"opening up\" the play too much.  If you're a fan of mysteries, you'll be intrigued by the performances and the script.  Joseph Mankiewicz's direction isn't terribly flashy, but subtle and well-done.Laurence Olivier stars as Andrew Wyke, a famous mystery novel writer.  Milo Tindle (Michael Cane), comes to visit him one weekend; asking for Andrew's wife's hand in marriage.  But things aren't as simple as they first appear. Andrew wants something in return from Milo.  And then again, maybe he doesn't.The film unfolds slowly and patiently; you almost feel like the film's sentient and realizes how juicy its secrets are, holding on to them for as long as possible.  There are numerous twists and surprises in the film; and even if you see one or two coming (as I did), don't expect to get it all right until it's over.  It's best not to know at all what is going to happen, so I'll leave you with no more clues.I enjoyed nearly every moment after the initial meeting between Milo and Andrew.  Once Cane and Olivier really get going in their scenes, the film never looks back.  They are exceptional in their performances, and deservedly earned nominations for Best Actor Oscars.So who wins?  Does anyone win?  Is it a game with a winner at all?  Oh just go rent it already!",

Brilliantly played out by two of the all time great actors, Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier, Sleuth tells the twisted story of two men constantly trying to one-up the other with games and wit which could lead to deadly outcomes. It's 2 hours and 18 minutes and not a single second lost my attention. Even more impressive that it all takes place in one house, over the course of just a night or two, and yet the film doesn't drag nor hold up on thrills. It's not a film that can necessarily be duplicated ever again, considering the social media age we live in now, but considering this film still holds up, we never need another rendition.8.3/10",

Laurence Olivier is truly magnificent here, as he almost always was. Michael Caine, only 39 at the time, holds his own and that is far from an easy thing to do in a production like this. Joseph L.

Instead of being angry, he seems to be delighted and proposes an ingenious robbery scheme that will benefit both men. Soon, the two men find themselves locked in an ingenious and devious duel, but who gets the last laugh on whom?With the right ingredients film-making can seem so easy. The cast consists of just two actors, Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, but with these heavyweights, it's hard to go wrong. Playwright Anthony Shaffer (FRENZY, THE WICKER MAN) wrote a brilliantly ingenious script with crackling dialog, and veteran director Joseph L. Mankiewicz (A LETTER TO THREE WIVES, ALL ABOUT EVE), who knows all the cinematic tricks and has an uncanny aye for detail, manages to avoid this \"play\" from becoming static in any way. It was to be his last film, and what a grand way to say goodbye to cinema. A real treat from start to finish. Highly recommended!Camera Obscura --- 10/10",

An ultimate game is being played on its audience .This lighthearted suspense/mystery based on a hit play from Anthony Shaffer and being well adapted ; dealing with games-playing mystery novelist played by Olivier leading his spouse's lover performed by Caine into diabolical trap . The original stage production of \"Sleuth\" by Anthony Shaffer opened on Broadway on 12 November 1970. It originally starred Anthony Quayle as Andrew and Keith Baxter as Milo, ran for 1222 performances and won the 1971 Tony Award for the Best Play . This is a deliciously sardonic and witty movie and excellently starred by a magnificent protagonist duo ; both are the peak of their game in this dazzling film . This interesting movie is plenty of twists and turns and stunning surprises . Splendid and fascinating performances , a real Tour De force for two stars . Michael Caine was so very much beside himself to be working with Laurence Olivier, that he didn't even know how to address him . However , Michael Caine was the third choice for the part of Milo Tindle after Albert Finney , who was deemed too plump, and Alan Bates , who turned down the role . The film only had two stars - the rest of the cast were made-up names . In addition to Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) and Give 'em Hell, Harry! (1975), only one of three films in which entire on-screen billed cast received acting Oscar nominations . Packs a jolly and adequate soundtrack , including a haunting, remarkable musical leitmotif by John Addison , who was nominated for an Oscar for his music score. Colorful cinematography by Oswald Morris as well as appropriate production design by Ken Adam . Remade many years later as \u00a8Sleuth\u00a8(2007) by Kenneth Branagh starred by Jude Law and again Michael Caine as Wyke ; including modern production design and set on a stark house , monitored with high tech . However, it is inferior the first version that was a directed by Joseph L Mankiewicz, in his last film . In the similar style was subsequently filmed 'Deathtrap' by Sidney Lumet with Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and also Michael Caine. Rating : Good, delicious from start to finish.

It involves a plot to get rid of a extravagant woman through manipulation. The kicker is that the two principles are both masters at solving problems, using creative solutions. They are equals and that's where the fun comes in. I have always loved it when a mystery film has enough complexity to have me fooled.

            "content": "Sleuth is about playing games on one another- sinister, bizarre, but ruthlessly witty and almost charming games- and it's maybe more-so about the depths to which masculinity may be displayed in the most conniving but mannered manners. The premise is simple, sort of: Milo (Caine) is invited by Andrew (Olivier) to his sprawling estate, and the detective-fiction writer questions Milo about having an affair/planning to marry his wife. But there's a twist: Milo will steal his wife's jewels, sell them, and both reap the rewards via insurance payoff for Andrew and clean get away for Milo. At least, this is what is first thought of, crazily enough. This is just the beginning of a back-and-forth display of gamesmanship by two evenly matched men who can't leave un-humiliated for long.Schaffer's play, and subsequent screenplay, play on the idea of these two generations of men- Andrew's refined, regal, seemingly upstanding if definitely eccentric old-timer, and Milo's new-wave, half-immigrant youngun- coming together over a battle of wills in the guise of mind-f***ing. What's even cleverer, and which the director Mankiewicz (his final great feature) latches onto, is the mood of the setting, the various figures and puppets and animatronics like some kind of creepy 1950s Disneyland attraction, and how they almost work into the thick of things as their 'audience', cutting back to them every minute or so. And every line of dialog, every little nuance and trifle and rise and fall of the game at hand, is brilliantly charged for actors to latch onto and make it their own times 100.And it goes without saying one can't get better, if you want pure gold movie performance from Britain, via Olivier and Caine. If anything, though some might disagree, Caine may possibly win out as giving the better overall performance (which is saying something), but this doesn't mean Olivier is off his game; on the contrary he relishes Andrew in the first half- when he's dealing the wicked game at Milo- and the second when the tables are turned. If you're idea of two character playing psychological and plot-driven cat-and-mouse isn't your idea of a good time, don't go near it. But if you're looking for something that's pure black comedy done with a delight that few films can muster, and even leans towards the lighthearted here and there, this is your movie. It also features the a truly creepy closing.",

            "content": "One man is a famed mystery novelist, Andrew Wyke, the other is a braggadocios young businessman named Milo Tindle. One day, they meet in the writer's automaton and game filled manor house (that assuredly directly inspired the mansion in 'Knives Out'). They have nothing in common- except for the writer's wife, that is. Tindle is her lover, and both men want her for themselves. The writer has a cunning plan as Machiavellian as some of his plots to ensure the businessman winds up with nothing before the day is out. Tindle, though, has a plan of his own; and a fiendish battle of wits and wills ensues.Based on Anthony Schaffer's Tony-winning play that originally starred Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter as novelist and businessman respectively, this adaptation features Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine in their places, and is a highlight in the careers of both men. Schaffer's screenplay is full of vicious verbal barbs as Wyke and Tindle have a sparring match full of twists, turns and double-crosses. Their battle of wits becomes a battle of class, and the story is as unpredictable as it is clever.Olivier's mixed feelings towards his place in cinema is well documented, and often his on-screen performances seem very mannered and actorly- over the top even. As the pompous, old- fashioned Wyke, however, the overly theatrical streak doesn't seem out of place. He is a classist, racist good ol' boy of the English aristocracy, and Olivier plays him brilliantly. In the latter half of his career, he took film roles for the money and was quite open about it. Here, however, you can see he relishes playing Wyke and is having a ball speaking Schaffer's fantastic lines.Caine- one of the most natural filmic actors the business has ever seen- is terrific as the cocky businessman Tindle. His performance is one of much depth, he plays Tindle like a working-class tinderbox ready to ignite the moment anyone mentions his accent. His disrespect for Wyke clouds his judgement, and he can't see when he's being played by the old man. Whereas Olivier is formal and exact, Caine is like a jazz musician, going this way and that with the rhythm; and his is arguably the better performance.(As an aside, in 2007, Caine starred as Wyke in Kenneth Branagh's remake, written by Harold Pinter. While the film isn't as good, its interesting to see him play both characters; and in both he overshadows his screen partner).This could very well be one of- if not the- best adaptations of a play ever put to film. It is beautifully photographed by Oswald Morris, who also shot the screen versions of 'Oliver' and 'Fiddler on the Roof'- he clearly understood how to film theatrical adaptations.The stirring, John Addison score signifies mystery and intrigue like few other scores have done before or since, and the set design is remarkably detailed and rich. Wyke's manor is so full of memorabilia, knick knacks and automata it makes the Thrombey mansion from the overrated 'Knives Out' look positively sparse.Terrific performances from two fine actors, crisp cinematography, tight direction from Joseph L Mankiewicz, incredible set design and a brilliant, complex Anthony Schaffer screenplay- what more could you ask for? This two-hander whodunnit is fiendishly good.",

With a very small cast, of which Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine are the main protagonists, perfectly directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, using a screenplay by Anthony Shaffer (and how wasn't he nominated for an Oscar too?), and with a humorous main theme provided by John Addison, Sleuth succeeds in becoming one of the most perfect thrillers in cinema's history.Milo Tindle (Caine) travels to Andrew Wyke's mansion to discuss the affair he's having with Wyke's wife. Wyke (Olivier) is a famous author of detective novels and he lives a fantasy life in a fantasy house populated by mechanical toys (or automata, as he calls them), puzzles, parlor games, his awards (an Edgar Allan Poe Award no less!), and other jovial objects that show what an eccentric and inventive person Wyke is.The art direction in this movie is one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. If the purpose of art direction is to fill the movie with those objects that give depth and authenticity to the movie even if they're not part of the story, to recreate worlds that suit the characters, to express themes, then the art direction in this movie is spot on. One look at Wyke's living room and all one needs to know about him comes instantly. Furthermore, this is one of the rare movies where the art direction plays a very large role, as the objects around them are used, abused, referred to - they pretty much become another character, and I'm sure the people in charge of it had a lot of fun during the movie.So Milo wants to marry Wyke's wife. Wyke isn't much too bothered but he wonders how Milo, a humble hairdresser, expects to support a woman used to luxuries. Wyke proposes a plan that'll suit both: Milo steals the jewels in the mansion's safe, sells them and gets rich; Wyke, who's insured the jewels, merely has to collect the insurance money. It's perfect and harmless. Wyke has everything planned and instructs Milo in every step of the plan. It all seems perfect until Wyke does something unexpected and the movie reaches the first of its many twists. From here on the movie becomes unpredictable, but never loses its wit and humor.In the end, the movie uses the thriller to explore questions about class difference, as Milo and Wyke represent two different worlds: Milo, descendant of Italian immigrants and a working-class man, and the aristocratic Wyke. Their confrontation goes beyond women, for Wyke it's an attack on his persona and all he represents as a member of a dying breed of people who can't stand people like Milo rising above their humble conditions.The confrontation between Olivier and Caine is unforgettable. Watching these two giants of cinema trying to upstage each other on screen is one of those experiences we seldom see in cinema. It may have to do with the fact that the movie is based on a play, making it quite theatrical. The dialogue is intelligent and verbose - I'm constantly surprised by Wyke's wide vocabulary.The movie is also quite artificial, in the best sense. Sleuth, for me, represents the purpose of cinema as an art form: not as a dull representation of reality (like those pseudo-documentaries that pass off as movies these days - The Hurt Locker, for instance - which by being so impartial and documentary have nothing to say about anything at all), but as a space to extrapolate, to let imagination run wild, to create situations that wouldn't happen in real life but nevertheless shed insight into human existence. Watching Sleuth today, one sees how insignificant and monotonous cinema has become, which only makes jewels like Sleuth the more important.",

            "content": "To me, \"Sleuth\" is a demonstration of the problem with the Oscars (certainly a problem in 1972, and perhaps now also). The problem was that, even before the casting was done for the film of Mario Puzo's \"The Godfather,\" everyone knew that whoever played the leading role was going to receive the Best Actor Oscar, irrespective of the performance. To rate Brando's performance above the performances of Caine and Olivier that year is nothing short of ludicrous. All I can say is thank God that at least Joel Grey received the best support Oscar for \"Cabaret\" that year.I first saw Anthony Schaffer's play on the London stage about two years prior to the release of the movie. The leading roles were taken by Paul Rogers and Donal Donnelly, two fine English actors who were superb in these parts. I remember thinking what a difficult thing it would be to make a film of this, but I was sure that someone would try it and make a mess of it. How wrong I was!I note that \"Sleuth\" comes up as #250 in the IMDB top 250. I recently selected my top 100 and it comes up at #55. This is a magnificent movie that keeps one on the edge of the seat for its entire length. The performances of the two leads as they play the same game a number of times is stunning. Here is the man acknowledged as perhaps the greatest actor of the 20th century, and here is the Cockney up-start Caine (famous for his \"kitchen-sink\" roles such as in \"Alfie\") matching him at every turn and often soaring above him.But in saying all this, I need to put in a plug for perhaps the finest supporting performances ever delivered. Alec Cawthorne, a man few have heard of outside \"Sleuth,\" is mesmerising as Doppler, while John Matthews and Eve Channing, although having very minor parts, imbue every nuance of their performances with ethereal splendour.",

From the cinematographer's point of view Sleuth can be best compared to that classic film of Eugene O'Neill's play. The souls of the dysfunctional Tyrone family are laid bare there. In Sleuth upper class mystery writer Laurence Olivier and hair salon owner Michael Caine are also laid bare. The difference is that these two are hardly related, in fact are antagonists in every way possible.That's because Caine has been bedding Olivier's wife. Not that it is of any real concern to Olivier as he has a mistress of his own. But there is a certain patrician pride involved.So he gets Caine over to his estate on a pretext and the two of them start playing mind games. Olivier is far more experienced at this then Caine, his set do it for sport. He beats Caine, but Caine comes back in a week for rematch and Caine who has a surname anglicized from Italian and had a humble station in life plays quite for real. He's also a fast learner.Dialog is almost all in this battle of wit and the repartee from Anthony Shaffer's pen is superb for both characters. Sleuth got four Oscar nominations and two of those went to both Olivier and Caine for Best Actor. But even with them splitting the Sleuth vote I doubt that either would have beaten Marlon Brando that year for the Oscar.I have not yet seen it, but I look forward to the remake of Sleuth with Caine now aged into the mystery writer's part. But this version is more than adequate, in fact superb.",

            "content": "Andrew Wyke is an author of detective mystery novels who has done very well from his career. His passion in life is mysteries and games and he hates to lose \u0096 even when he doesn't care about the stakes. As a result he summons cocky hairdresser Milo Tindle to his country estate to confront him about the affair with his wife and let him know that he knows of Milo's plans to steal her away from him. Not that he cares of course \u0096 because actually he has a proposal for Milo: steal Wyke's jewellery and fence it for cash, while Wyke himself releases the value from the insurance company. Thus both men move forward with their lives with money and happiness. Or at least, that's how it seems but in this house of games what is really real?I was going to watch the remake recently but instead I took advantage of a recent TV showing of the original to remind myself of it first. You see it had been almost twenty years since I last saw this film and, despite making me feel old, it also meant I had forgotten the detail of the many twists (although of course the main ones were still known to me). This relative freshness helped a lot because the film is most enjoyable when you are caught up in the moment and not able to think (or remember) too far ahead. The reason for this is that the whole film is a game and, as with many games, it is all in the playing. In film terms the \"playing\" is the \"delivering\" and here the delivery is great. Director Mankiewicz does really well with the action all confined within a couple of rooms for the majority. The camera moves around (and up) to good effect but the more impressive balancing act is how he keeps a handle on the constantly shifting tone \u0096 it swaps around constantly but never jars or seems clumsy.The key part is of course the performances, because here we have a film that is asking a handful of actors to hold the attention with constant dialogue for a film that is perhaps a shade too long for the material (in my opinion it could have lost twenty minutes across the whole thing and been better for it). The cast rise to the challenge whether they are old masters or, as in the case of Cawthorne, actors making their film debut. Olivier has a tougher role that it looks because, while he has to ham it up in a playful way, he also needs to keep it real for the viewer; he pulls it off really well and constructs an utterly believable character. Caine works very well with him and again manages to make the viewer forget how naive his character is being in act 1. Together these two carry the guts of the film and nail the material. Cawthorne has a smaller role than these two but a very important one with a great twist that he delivers really well.Sleuth is perhaps a shade overlong and may annoy modern viewers with the hammy nature of at least one of the characters but for the vast majority of viewers what we have here is a really engaging and enjoyable game that is well delivered by a handful of very good performances and a director who can use the space while also letting the cast fill it.",

The performances of Olivier and Caine were good of course, but the story itself defies credibility. I had the same reaction when I saw the 2007 remake with the Michael Caine role reversed, with Caine portraying Andrew against Jude Law's Milo Tindle. In some cases, this story is even more outlandish, the clown costume Milo was expected to wear a case in point. Why go through all the machinations to simulate a jewel robbery when it could have been over and done with, without all the nonsense?But the one thing I think eludes most viewers is that whole business about the third shot being a blank. In both pictures, Milo reacts as if he'd really been shot dead. But why? And even if one argues that he collapsed from the fright of potentially being murdered, how does one come to grips with the fact that at some point he would wake up? At that point, would Milo have meekly left the Wyke estate without further confrontation with the scheming novelist? The whole scenario as presented doesn't ring true for this viewer.I've given this picture a one point higher rating than the remake primarily because of Olivier and Caine, and the oddball set up with all the toys throughout the Wyke mansion. For a while this one didn't look like it was headed for the same type of finale as the later picture, but Olivier's character managed to turn things around to it's inevitable conclusion. Though the outcome remained the same for Milo Tindle in both movies, I'd have to say that in the remake, Milo's death scene made a bigger splash.",

Very clever, original and powerful.Not perfect - the first half felt a bit clumsy at times and not entirely watertight, plot-wise in spells. The clown outfit was a tad silly and unrealistic.

            "content": "I was lucky enough to catch the stage version of \"Sleuth\" in London as a teenager in 1974. It was - and still is - the most involving and entertaining mystery play I've ever seen (kudos 30 years later to the two actors whose names I no longer recall). So when I saw a video version of this play in 1990 or so, I was anxious to see if the snap and pop of the stage play would carry over to film. Boy, did it ever. In spite of the enormous bite of my budget, I gladly spent the $20+ to have it, and watched it several more times in the intervening years on a slow weekend late at night. What prompted this review in 2007 was that the Mystery channel revived it a few nights back, and even though I already have a VHS copy, I stayed up to watch it. (That's how much of a fan I am). The best part was that Paramount supplied the \"closed caption\" feature, and so I was finally able to catch the full meaning of a few phrases that had escaped me over the years (especially when Wyke calls Tindall a \"jumped up pantry boy who doesn't know his place.\" I had thought Wyke called him a \"pansy boy\", but \"pantry boy\" makes much more sense now that I understand the landed English gentry's attitude towards the immigrant class.) Jesus, this is a great movie - IF you like plots involving psychological tension and a battle of wits. Yes, there are a couple of lapses in the film version that might weaken the story a bit more (the reviewer who mentions that you can't help but notice*****SPOILER********* that Inspector Doppler is just Tindal with makeup *****SPOILER ENDS*****is dead on. But it doesn't really matter after you've seen the story for the first time, anyway, and I've watched it at least six times now in the past 15 years. I just like the hell out of this production. The younger version of me was horrified and appalled by the denouement, but the older me -who understands disappointment and fatalism and Pyrrhic victory - now finds it perfectly appropriate and satisfying. Watching young Michael Caine hold his own with superstar Laurence Olivier also provides a special kind of satisfaction - knowing how long and storied a career Caine has enjoyed, it's a lot of fun seeing the raw talent and \"juice\" in the actor as he starts out. If you haven't seen \"Sleuth\" and you like psychological drama (like \"Deathtrap\", which is the only similar movie that even comes close to being this good), you owe it to yourself to set aside some time to see \"Sleuth\".",

I realized that there was a remake of this film with one of its original stars and Jude Law, but I chose not to see it because like with every film that has to suffer through a remake, I wanted to see the original (the fact that I had heard it hadn't made it to DVD hadn't eased my stubbornness). So there I was at Blockbuster, and what did I see? THE ORIGINAL \"SLEUTH\" ON DVD! Needless to say I snatched it right up, and I couldn't wait to watch it. While it's a good film, and succeeds at being unpredictable (a rarity), it left me with something to be desired.Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) is invited over to the house of Andrew Wyke (Laurence Olivier) to discuss the divorce of Andrew's wife Margurite, who is also Milo's lover (a fact known by Andrew). But since both of them know that Milo can't afford Margurite's spending habits, Andrew offers Milo a solution that will leave both he and Milo very happy. And so begins a series of twisted games where the stakes grow increasingly higher.There are two problems with \"Sleuth:\" pacing and Caine. \"Sleuth\" is at times very talky, and it causes the film to drag. Caine and Olivier take advantage of the material the best they can, but they can't help the film from being slowed down by the excess dialogue.When I say that there is a problem with Caine's performance, I must tread lightly and be very vague, because it's only in one scene, and to describe it would give away one of the film's biggest surprises. But apart from that scene, Caine is terrific with Olivier.Olivier clearly has a lot of fun with this role. At times he is an eccentric old man, but at others he is a force to be reckoned with, and Olivier switches from one side of the coin to the other flawlessly.It would be unfair to blame director Joseph L. Mankiewicz for the pacing, since there is so much padded dialogue that Mankiewicz can't do much to rectify the situation. While one could argue that a lot of dialogue can be a drawing point, playwright/screenwriter Anthony Shaffer is no Quentin Tarantino (in fact, he's closer to David Mamet's \"Glengarry Glen Ross\"-not a good thing). And Tarantino was never this wordy anyway.But Mankiewicz does solid work with \"Sleuth.\" He adapts the play so that while it is never a filmed version of a stage play, it stays true to its stage roots. I liked how he used the toys and dolls that are all over Wyke's house to enhance the creepiness of the play, but again, the dialogue is so wordy that it counteracts everything Makiewicz tries to do to ratchet up the tension, so the film seems longer than it should be.Normally a film is inferior to its source material. It's a wonder to find a film that is hampered by it.",

With Sleuth, the play is converted 'cinematically' very effectively; the direction is fine, the production design and the acting, in particular, are superb. But for all this, the film still doesn't work as well as it should and this, surprisingly, is in the actual writing of the screenplay rather than the shooting of it. Before going any further, this does contain spoilers of a kind, you have been warned... As soon as the character of Inspector Doppler appears, despite efforts to disguise this in the opening credits, it is blatantly obvious that he is Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) in disguise and you would HAVE to be short-sighted not to notice. What can be easily achieved on stage where the audience is at a distance from the performers simply cannot be done on screen where the actors are under much closer scrutiny. This completely ruins the key moment of trickery in the entire play and we sit there waiting to see if Andrew Wyke (Laurence Olivier) will notice what we noticed straight away. Then we are supposed to be surprised when 'Doppler' reveals his true identity. What is even more dismaying is that the solution to this problem is so straightforward. If a third actor had been used to play Inspector Doppler then no one would suspect a thing and then when the moment of truth emerges, the film can cut to Michael Caine disguised as the third actor just as he removes the mask. It may not be 100% convincing but at least it will fool the audience for as long as was originally intended.\n This would have made a decent film much more effective and enjoyable and justice would have been done to a great play.",

It's also really best if you watch the original before the remake, if you do decide to torture yourself with the remake. And most of all, it's best if you see Anthony Shaffer's play onstage before either of the films. My mom saw the play in San Francisco, and I'll never forget her story of how exciting it was. Seeing Sleuth onstage was an experience, she always said. The film just isn't the same.Both Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine were nominated for Best Actor at the 1973 Oscars, and while both are tour-de-force parts, they were beaten out by Marlon Brando in The Godfather, which was pretty ridiculous. I had a Sleuth marathon and watched both versions on back-to-back evenings, and it wasn't until I watched the 2007 version that I truly appreciated Laurence Olivier's performance. You really don't have to watch the remake, though; you can just appreciate all Larry does the first time around. He truly embodies the role as Anthony Shaffer wrote it. You can actually see the wheels turning in his head as he and others play out his games, and the more the games are played, the more he feels alive and virile. He's excited, and always in control, and more than perhaps any other of his performances I've seen, you can imagine that he actually lives in the mental state of his character even when the cameras are turned off. Without revealing any more of the plot, I'll move on to the other main performance.Michael Caine is the dumb to Larry's smarts, the youth to his age, and the emotion to his cunning. He does a very good job, and I guarantee there will be certain scenes of his that will stick with you decades after you watch them. I happen to like Michael Caine more than Laurence Olivier, but in my reviews I try not to let personal feelings interfere with objective talent. However, Michael Caine is the infinitely more likable character in the story, and if you're as partial to him as I am, you'll probably be very rattled by this version. As anxious as you'll be to watch the remake and see him in the larger role, once you do, you'll realize his place was best in the 1972 version. He's much more convincing as the low-class \"Alfie\" type than as the blue-blood who thinks quicker than he breathes.Joe Mankiewicz's direction was very odd, splicing in close-ups of objects around the house in the middle of long shots that were meant to immerse audiences in the tense dialogue. It was jarring and added nothing to the story. John Addison obviously got his wires crossed and believed he was scoring music for Murder by Death, Without a Clue, or some other spoof. His music had no place in an intense drama, and if I'm being kind, I'll say it was distracting.Fans of either of the main leads will probably want to rent this classic, and since you didn't grow up hearing my mom's story, you won't be nearly as disappointed in it as I was. At the very least you'll get to watch some good acting, but be forewarned: I had nightmares after I watched it! Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence and some frightening images, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",

            "content": "Like 3:10 to Yuma, Sleuth has also been remade this year, and I'm watching the original as part of homework prior to the local release, hopefully, sometime soon. Based on a play by Anthony Shaffer, Sleuth is arguably one of the pioneers of the sleight of hand, and because it originally started off for the stage, the number of sets are limited, but that provides focus for the story, dialogue and characters, which most films of today tend to disregard and disguise their shortcomings with snazzy special effects. You'll be hard pressed to identify those which provide an equally intriguing story, and having pedigree thespians like Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine in its cast certainly is a bonus. In the remake, Michael Caine's Milo Tindle gets played by Jude Law, and I won't be surprised if along the way more of Caine's movies, if they do get remade, will get played by Law (the first being Alfie), given Law's charmingly good looks and demeanour almost resembling Caine's on screen persona in his younger days as the quintessential Englishman.Sleuth tells the story of a wealthy renowned author of detective stories, Andrew Wyke (Olivier) inviting Milo to his ostentatious home, at first to partake in a few drinks, trivial chit chat, and plenty of game playing (his home is rigged with so many tricks and toys), before something more sinister is revealed. Milo happens to be the secret lover of Andrew's wife Marguerite, and what transpires after that, is a psychological battle of wits to see who in actual fact, has the upper hand.What I liked about the story is its theme of humiliation. When you put someone down, and in the process strip him of all his humanity, fueling him with nothing but despair, making him beg for the right to live, what happens then? Can everything be is all and end all with a simple apology, or to allow some getting back at, if so, where do you draw the line, and would you cross it?And with a runtime of close to 2.5 hours, you can bet your last dollar that everything is more than meets the eye, and that's where Shaffer's story shines. It yanks the carpet under your feet again and again, without resorting to much trickery or too pretentious a premise that it becomes unbelievable. And despite it being made about 35 years ago, it has definitely withstood the test of time, which is a hallmark of all great stories. Having the acting chops of both Olivier and Caine also proved that you don't need ensemble casts, so long as you have great actors who deliver every time.",

            "content": "This is the type of film I really like: twisted tales of mystery and deceit featuring great actors who like to slice the ham thick. I wanted to like SLEUTH. No, I wanted to love SLEUTH. Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, squaring off in a murderous battle of wits: What's not to love?SPOILERS.....But, I was very disappointed the first time I saw SLEUTH, and subsequently have seen it four or five more times to no avail. The film is clumsy and hokey and as smart as it thinks it is, it is really pretty dumb.To succeed the story relies on characters who are alternately brilliantly diabolical and just plain dumb. For a film of this sort to work, the audience can't be in on the scam. We have to believe the film is going one way, when it is actually going another. Sleight of hand, as it were. Any storyteller can make one character fool another; it takes skill for someone to honestly fool his audience.I even know exactly when the film started going astray. When one character suggests that another disguise himself as a burglar by dressing up as a circus clown. That's dumb. Worse, is when the other character does so. That's just plain stupid. It becomes apparent that the robbery scheme being discussed is bogus. One character is lying to the other, and we know it -- and we know he should know it as well. We see through the gambits, the disguises and the lies, but the characters who are supposed to be smarter than us, don't. Worse, the film keeps announcing that it is being clever and pulling scams. See how smart I am! See what a fool you are for being fooled! Now shut up while I fool you some more. SLEUTH is too obvious; it wears its cleverness like a neon sign.And it is a small point, but what was with director Joseph Mankiewicz's repeated cutaway shots to laughing clowns and smiling puppets? Once or twice it is stylish; but repeatedly it seem like a desperate attempt to jazz up the story or, worse, an attempt to cover up sloppy editing. Whatever, it was a constant annoyance.  This film has a companion piece called DEATHTRAP. They have similar themes and gimmicky plots and both star Michael Caine. DEATHTRAP is considered the poor cousin of SLEUTH. I disagree; DEATHTRAP may lack the over-the-top theatrics of SLEUTH (which, in itself, is not a bad thing) but it is more than just clever, it is tight, sly and truly surprising. Everything SLEUTH isn't.",

            "content": "Yes it goes without saying that a project as ambitious as this was bound to have flaws, and Sleuth (1972) does have a few, mostly niggling, but one quite major. But as others have pointed out already, any sort of made up disguise under the bright glare of studio lights and the close scrutiny of cine-cameras is nigh on impossible to pull off, even today, 35 yrs later - just look at all the TV shows that disguise their presenters to fool the public and you will very rarely be fooled as a viewer. The plot demanded that this disguise scene was essential, and so they just got on with it and did the best they could with making it look believable. I thought they did a reasonable job with it, myself, and no it wasn't undetectable, but it was good enough not to look embarrassingly abysmal. Don't forget though, that essentially this was a piece of theatre still, filmed or not, and there were many other clear pointers to this being a stage mystery and not a flat out naturalistic, trying to be real thriller - none more so than the casting of Mr. Olivier, and the wordy script, so the unlikely disguise factor was not alone in pricking viewers' bubbles. When you watch filmed theatre you have to do a certain amount of belief suspending, or at least re-aligning your priorities as to what you want out of the piece. Too many people it seems, who have said it doesn't work, either are not making this necessary allowance for it on credibility terms, or much more sadly really, just do not know that there is a difference between filmed theatre and pure cinema.That this movie has engrossed so many over the years surely speaks of its overall success, despite the little flaws. And despite a lack of visual credibility being too much for some (seemlingly weened on nothing but Hollywood and TV for visual entertainment), this movie is an outstandingly successful and popular piece of entertainment, unlike many, many realistic thrillers and mysteries. It shows that theatrical writing, theatrical sets, and probably most of all, damned fine theatrical acting can still be as good as anything the grittiest and most worldly, realistic film makers can produce. I believe this is a masterpiece of old fashioned civilised entertainment and I love the OTT acting. Olivier shows off his very best high camp style of acting and proves yet again that it can be very cinematic, and Caine puts in one of his best 'I'll show them I can act' performances to give acting lovers a rare treat here. Lovers of detective novels are also very well catered for in this ever fabulous movie. A rightly acclaimed classic.",

            "content": "Andrew Wyke is a rather vain author of detective fiction who discovers his wife is having an affair with Milo Tindle, a younger man. Andrew invites Milo to his country retreat and proposes a mutually beneficial solution, but can Milo trust him ?Sleuth is a real treat. It's ingenious, it's very funny and it features two pretty unforgettable performances from the inimitable leads. It's based on a play by Anthony Schaffer (who also wrote Frenzy and The Wicker Man) and it's just a peach of an idea - a simple revenge story dressed up as an elaborate prank which then cleverly transmutates into a treatise on class struggle. It has a big midway twist which the jaded may criticise as either unfair or obvious without really appreciating how much fun the subsequent mayhem is. Caine and Olivier both milk the intrigue and the drama for all they're worth, one-upping each other with rustic accents and pratfalls, and sparring like two prizefighters over the soliloquies. Both are outstanding although for me Caine pips it, not least because their casting bears no small resemblance to their characters; Olivier was near-gentry (an uncle was a Baron) and lauded with every acting accolade and exclusive status possible, whilst Caine grew up in the East End and earned everything he got the hard way. Olivier is a good sport to play an ageing prima donna with empty boasts of his sexual prowess and he is very funny at times, but Caine's performance is much more natural, richer and thoughtful. It's also a revelation in that just two actors can play a whole movie and it never gets dull or needs any other storytelling devices - Robert Altman and Richard Attenborough take note. The story is so deliciously twisted that there are plenty of opportunities for mugging, but both stars reign it in a bit, with lots of sly little moments like the scene where Milo waits in vain to get a turn in the game of snooker. The other great aspect of the movie is Ken Adam's nutty production design; Andrew's house is a spooky old Victorian folly with a dungeon of a cellar, a hedge maze in the garden and a cavernous living room crammed full of creepy automata whose jerky movements reflect their owner's self-deluded illusion of puppet master. Mankiewicz was an interesting guy who began as a writer in the thirties then moved into production and is best known for directing All About Eve and Cleopatra. This was his final movie, and I think his best. Remade (with substantial changes) by Kenneth Branagh in 2007, with Caine playing Wyke and Jude Law playing Tindle.",

            "content": "Based on the play by Anthony Shaffer (writer of The Wicker Man), and from Oscar nominated director Joseph L. Mankiewicz (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, All About Eve, Guys and Dolls), I couldn't wait to see this positively rated film. Basically hairdresser Milo Tindle (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sir Michael Caine) has been invited to the house of successful detective stories writer Andrew Wyke (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Lord Sir Laurence Olivier), he is currently the lover of Wyke's wife Marguerite. Milo is hoping Andrew will divorce his wife so that he can marry her, but Andrew doesn't like the idea of having to give her half his money in the divorce process. So Andrew suggests that Milo should commit a realistic looking burglary of jewellery, in disguise as a clown as well, trashing the place and all, to claim the insurance for the damage. Milo agrees, and treats everything Andrew tells him to do as sort of fun, but by the time he finishes the \"crime\", Andrew points the gun he used to his head and says it was all part of a game, and he fires. Two days later, Andrew gets a knock on the door from Inspector Doppler who is looking for Milo, and investigating events that may have taken place in the house. The detective searches the house for clues that may lead to a murder charge, Andrew tries to convince him of the truth about the night in question, and explains that the gun fire heard was a blank. The detective however is convinced there was a murder seeing not only gun shot holes, but a newly dug grave, screwed up clothes and a blood stain, and he places Andrew under arrest. However, it is when Andrew has the handcuffs on that the detective reveals his true identity, it is Milo in a very convincing disguise playing a devious game to get back at Andrew, who tries to make it out like he knew all along. Milo then says he has one more game to play, but this time it is real, he says he has murdered Thea, the girl who agreed to play murder victim, strangling her, and he has phoned the police who will arrive at a certain time, and Andrew has until then to find the evidence that will make him guilty. Milo gives Andrew very little help, only some riddle style clues as to what the objects are and where to find them, and Andrew is panicking going all over the place to find these things. Eventually Andrew does find all four items in time before the police were apparently meant to arrive, but once again Milo reveals he was playing a fake game, he has not murdered anyone. Andrew has had enough of panicking for no reason and doesn't want to play anymore games, but Milo tells him he really did phone the police who will take him away for the first ever game played. Andrew is sure that this is another game, and he shoots Milo in cold blood with real bullets, but to his devastation he was this time telling the truth, Milo dies, the police car arrives and Andrew is trapped with all the evidence to prove him guilty. Also starring (apparently) Alec Cawthorne as Inspector Doppler, John Matthews as Detective Sergeant Tarrant, Eve Channing as Marguerite Wyke and Teddy Martin as Police Constable Higgs. Olivier being the antiques and puzzle fan, and Caine being the posh guy driven to be just as devious (and adding a great little humour disguised as the Irish detective), both create the most charismatic characters to counteract with each other, and you can tell they had fun making this film. I can sort of see what the critics mean by a stage play being better than a film, but with the most witty dialogue, a terrific cat-and-mouse style premise running strong, and a corkscrew plot, it is a brilliant mystery. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for John Addison, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Sir Michael Caine was number 44 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Lord Sir Laurence Olivier was number 21, and Caine number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Olivier was number 3 on Britain's Finest Actors, Olivier was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 4 on The World's Greatest Actor.

I'd long heard it was one of the best mystery thrillers ever made, and its near unavailability on DVD made it especially tantalizing. So when I finally stumbled across a copy today, I was thrilled. I had studiously avoided reading anything about the plot, so I had no preconceptions about the movie, beyond that it was supposed to be good.What a disappointment!! Now, I'm not saying it was a total waste of a movie (note the 6/10 rating I give it), I just can't remember the last time a movie so let me down. The plot was, at turns, ridiculous and predictable. The jewelry thief plot was absurd: how could Caine's character have been roped into that mess so easily? Wouldn't he have wondered why Olivier's character was not going to go out somewhere so he'd have an alibi during the \"robbery\"? Why was Caine's character so inconsistent during this scene -- one minute he's cynical and suspicious about the whole thing, an instant later he's gleefully dressing up as a circus clown and doing pratfalls off a ladder? And how about the next section of the movie -- the moment I saw Inspector Doppel, it was clear that this was a person in make-up. I was not immediately sure that it was who it turned out to be, but I thought of the possibility right off the bat. The whole movie proceeded this way. I guess people in the '70s were a bit more trusting of their movies; today, after \"The Sixth Sense\" and its innumerable imitators, it takes a bit more than a bad make-up job to pull the wool over an audiences' eyes.The look and feel of the film were dated and stage-bound. Manckiewicz made some great movies, but I found little of his customary skill here. The incessant cutaways to the ugly dummies and automatons were very grating.As for the acting, well...I'm not going to be popular for saying this (though I imagine my whole review up to this point won't be very well received), but I don't see what the big deal is with Olivier and Caine here. Well, Caine does pretty well (excepting his mugging for the camera while in the clown suit), but Olivier comes across as a bit shrill. And his horrible accents..! I've pretty much trashed the film to this point, but it does have redeeming qualities. In spite of the above, it's a mildly entertaining movie, and the dialogue is well-written: I can imagine that it's a pretty quotable movie.Anyways, I would say it's a take-it-or-leave-it movie. Entertaining enough, but vastly overrated, and not something you should go out of your way to see.",

This appears to be the first film directed by Mankiewicz that I watch, and I certainly don't intend to allow it to be the last. The author of the play and the script alike, however, I have taken in one other work by(Frenzy), and I am quite interested in adding more. You can tell that this was based on something for the stage; apart from how theatrical it is, the set is elaborate and gorgeously done, the amount of locations used is minimal, and the focus lies entirely on the amazing and incredibly well-delivered dialog(with some wordplay), the impeccably written, extremely thoroughly developed and credible characters, and the flawless, impossibly strong acting performances that bring them to life. The framing and cinematography are excellent. This has an absolutely brilliant plot, with astonishing and completely convincing twists(you can't figure out exactly what will happen). I refuse to give away what this is about; personally, I(intentionally) came into it blind, and I implore you, for the sake of your full enjoyment of the piece, do what you can to do the same. This is unbelievably suspenseful and exciting, and the subtlety is effective. Nothing is excessive, with perhaps one exception; the music is dramatic, and at times, arguably too much so. The pacing is best described as deliberate; this doesn't move slowly, but it doesn't feel the need to constantly pummel the audience, and it is all the better for it. This has a running time of two hours and ten minutes, and there isn't a boring moment to be found, or one that isn't important, or even one that isn't loaded with the underlying thick tension. The humor is marvelous. This does require you to know a bit about the British, and there is slang in the movie. There are a couple of mature themes, a little mild language and brief disturbing content in this. In general, it's not made for children. I recommend this to every fan of psychological thrillers, and would say that this is one of the greatest within said sub-genre. 10/10",

Well, yes, of course Olivier and Caine lord it up royally and work at times as if they're projecting to the back seats, but this is still an enjoyable entertainment, all the more so when you realise your attention has been held throughout by just two actors.The film does seem to fall into three acts a la the original play, but the great director Mankiewicz does just about enough to open out the action by introducing us to the characters in Olivier's garden (at the end of a tortuous maze) and then making his house seem larger than life, with a massive living area, cellar and upstairs rooms, linked moreover by the imposing (and significant to the plot) staircase.I won't attempt to pr\u00e9cis the plot, the whole thing is preposterous and could only occur in a thriller novel or play, which of course playwright Schaffer is well aware of. Underlying the complicated plotting is a critique of class snobbery, manners and eccentricity, but the whole is mainly a splendid homage to the old-fashioned ingenious mystery novels of the likes of Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh, GK Chesterton and others from that particular Golden Era of British upper-middle class society novelists.Although only two living characters are actually engaged here, the director time and again inserts images of the almost-lifelike automata with which Olivier weirdly populates his country pile to add to the strangeness and unreality of the unusual drama played out here. The house itself evokes a cross between some massive Gothic dolls-house and the house used in the popular \"Cluedo\" game, the overall effect being to highlight the artificiality and dehumanisation of the events depicted.The acting is, of necessity, played at a very high pitch and can seem camp at times, although this, certainly on Olivier's side, may have been deliberate. Caine is at least the equal of the celebrated Lord, but then again, cinema is the former's forte, so perhaps the main kudos should go to Olivier, much more a theatrical than cinematic performer (although a more theatrical piece you could hardly witness).There's just enough exposition delivered on the way to the conclusion by the characters to bind all the loose ends together before the curtain falls at the denouement and no-one will feel short-changed by that time. By the way, Caine was to later take on a similar two-hander on an almost identical theme, only with him in the \"Olivier\" part in \"Deathtrap\" (the late Christopher Reeve played the junior role in that movie), which I have it in mind to re-watch again very soon.",

            "content": "I didn't have the opportunity to watch Joseph L. Mankiewicz' infamous \"Cleopatra\" but it's enough to know the film's reputation. Starring Liz Taylor and Richard Burton's, the film is notorious for being Hollywood's most spectacular exercise in cinematic grandeur that almost caused the bankrupt of the 20th Century Fox and that best exemplified what needed to be destroyed to pave the way to a new generation of auteur-oriented and European-realism driven film-makers.My intend is not to prove that Mankiewicz carries a personal responsibility in the demise of the Old Hollywood system, but my guess is that after such a big-budgeted orgy, he must have woken up with one hell of a cinematic hangover, that might explain the diet-like minimalism of a movie like \"Sleuth\", his last movie, and a marvelous gem of genre-bending comedy/thriller/mystery of a film, proving if a proof was ever needed, that creativity and inventiveness can transcend any limited budget and casting, provided you trust your material, you respectfully regards your audience's intelligence and cast Sir Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine in the lead roles. With this mindset and actors of such caliber, \"Sleuth\" couldn't go wrong, except in not winning an Oscar for Best Actor but Marlon Brando created such an icon through his portrayal of Don Corleone, that if one actor should have won instead of him, it should have been Al Pacino.Look at them in the poster, holding their magnifying glasses: Sir Laurence Olivier is the sophisticated detective fiction novelist Andrew Wyke and Michael Caine is Milo Tindle, a half-British, half-Italian hairdresser, a detestable go-getter in the eyes of Wyke, an opinion probably biased by the fact that Tindle happens to be the lover of Marguerite, his wife. Anyway, from the basic characteristics of the two men, whether it's a love rivalry, a class-conflict, a generation gap or a first-sight physical difference (the tall and handsome Tindle towering the old and bald Wyke), we have the ingredients of an inevitable antagonism, and what's more fitting, more gentleman-like field to express this antagonism, than a game, a game with as many rounds as twists in the plot. What's more natural than a game in a movie based on a play, magnificently written by Anthony Schaffer? The movie opens with Tindle visiting Wyke's manor to find him in a garden hedge maze, the man is fond of crime stories, and can be seen as a fictional 'Agatha Christie'-like character. The maze is the first clue that connects the viewer to his fondness for games, until we penetrate his house and find a billiard, musical playing dolls, laughing automatons, darts and cardboard, many elements betraying the spirit of a man who can't speak a straight-forward language and go to a point without using codes or games. Wyke is a cold upper-class sophisticated gentleman, but there's something buffoonish in his attitude, a child-like enthusiasm that confines to comedy, in which Tindle appears as the perfect straight-man. The most interesting aspect of the interactions between Wyke and Tindle is that it invites us to question our own involvement with Wyke, if we were in Tindle's shoes. Would we be tempted to 'play the game'? The game starts rather simply anyways, Wyke, the criminology expert suggests Tindle steals Marguerite's jewelery and leave many robbery's clues such as a broken window or footprints. Tindle can sell the jewels and then gets enough money to accommodate a woman more accustomed with a wealthy lifestyle and Wyke can satisfy his new love, Thea, with the insurance money. In Nash's theory of games, it's called a win-win situation. Not only Tindle accepts but he plays the game with a puerile enthusiasm, he wears all kind of disguises, follow all the instructions until it became clear in the house that a burglar entered. At that point of the film, we're far from imagining where this entire situation would lead, until Wyke reveals his darkest side. As a Detective stories writer, he basically created a perfect crime, with the perfect set-up; he can kill Tindle and pretend it was self-defense. The film is such a challenge for anticipation that even with these elements in mind, be sure you'll be surprised.The greatest merit of the film relies on its script, inexplicably not Oscar-nominated, \"Sleuth\" manages to keep this touch of surrealism while portraying real-life situations with an intense and magnetic force. The game remains the core of the Wyke/Tindle opposition and more than a way to expose a winner and loser at the end, it's a device to determine the value of a man through the way he faces the most frightening threats. It's not all about 'playing the game' by taking part of it, but it's about humiliating the other and still keeping it as a game. The film evolves from twists to twists until the two leads transcend the previous roots of their antagonism and engage in a battle of wits with an unpredictable ending.The directing by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, rightfully Oscar-nominated, is one of the highlights of the film as the veteran director displays an admirable capability to turn a big place with two men into a claustrophobic and suffocating atmosphere, and increase its maddening effect by automaton's mechanical laughs and musical dolls. The atmosphere is so nervous, so intensely paranoid that we can't wait for the game to conclude in a way or another. As viewers, we're part of the games too, and we're invited to follow the clues or questions them and to witness this crazy pair until the ultimate showdown. \"Sleuth\" is not just about a game, it's a game within itself, where nothing, no sign, no clue, no name, can be left for granted, where cheating is as valuable as playing and where the expectation of the outcome conveys the most heart-pounding sensations, until the final thrill \u0085 and one hell of a final line, and final shot. Basically, until the game is over",

            "content": "This movie gets it all wrong. After seeing too many switcheroo movies, author Anthony Shaffer has come to believe that if one reversal is good than a new reversal every ten minutes for over two hours must be genius. He has no insight or understanding of why a twist is satisfying. This movie is little more than an insipid, endless series of ruses and reversals. It doesn't build (except a viewers annoyance) and when the final twist arrives, the movie finally offers viewers some mercy and arbitrarily ends it there; but calling it quits forty minutes earlier would have been just dandy. It is a poorly adapted play, in that the characters never shut up and the film never does anything filmic. In another massive blunder, Shaffer was allowed to turn his own play into a script. He does so with a deeply impressed self-reverence.Spoiler ahead:If you think that even the stupidest viewer can't figure out that this piece of dreck only has two actors in it the whole time, you are a nerd. I was never surprised that the new character (serially introduced... duh!) was just Caine again. Each new gambit is a no-brainer. That the the two actors think the material is deep or well-suited for this hideous master-thespian treatment only makes the whole train wreck that much more unbearable. If they had filmed Olivier and Caine masturbating for two hours the results would have been a lot like this movie. I can only imagine that people who rave about this are frustrated actors who relish the idea of playing a part this self-indulgent. Every copy of this movie should be tracked down and pitched into a live volcano. I despise this movie. It is NOT a thoughtful movie. It's an assinine, dumb movie.Caine also appears in the second most grating thriller mystery ever filmed: DeathTrap. For the record, the third is The Last of Sheila, a grating foray into the mystery genre from Stephen Sondheim.",

I know it's a popular classic but it just doesn't work for me. It starts off well but it's not long before Olivier starts hamming it up outrageously, and his incessant shouting and gesticulating wears very thin very quickly. By the time he conducts a frantic search of the house (for reasons I won't go into) I'd had just about enough of his frankly terrible performance.Michael Caine fares much, much better - watch his posh accent slip even before things get hairy - and gets the tone of every scene just right. What's also one of the film's few saving graces is that he doesn't downplay his performance to compensate for Olivier's screaming - he bravely stands his ground and plays it exactly as it should be.I also won't go into the details of the film's central flaw - no, not the omnipresent gaping plot holes and unbelievable coincidences - but you'll know what I mean when you see it, and it'll kill the entire second act for you.Admittedly it offers a few good moments and deliciously nasty surprises, but it looks like a TV movie or a late-era Carry On. . . film, goes on for far too long, and my interest had waned long before the ridiculous, logic-defying final moments.",

            "content": "It takes a rather talented filmmaker to engineer a major plot twist in any film, subtly leaving various hints for the viewer and only revealing their significance when the story requires it. In less-masterly hands, the twist becomes completely obvious from the outset, the director's intentions as invisible as an elephant tramping through the city. However, those with a thorough understanding of the filmic medium can pull the wool straight over our eyes. Once the twist has been revealed and we understand our oversight, we do feel a little foolish, but there's little resentment at having been led astray: we accept that we have been fooled by an expert. Now imagine a film that manages to accomplish this feat \u0096 not one, not two \u0096 but three times! {come to think of it, there's probably more twists that I don't remember}. 'Sleuth (1972)' is an astoundingly-entertaining piece of film-making, a gripping cat-and-mouse game between two masters of deception, Andrew Wyke (Laurence Olivier) and Milo Tindle (Michael Caine).'Sleuth' was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz {his last directorial effort} and adapted by British playwright Anthony Shaffer from his own successful 1970 play. The plot centres on a wealthy author of detective novels, Andrew Wyke, who invites his wife's lover, Milo Tindle, to his mansion in a twisted bid to test and humiliate him. An enthusiastic player of games, Wyke delights in coercing Tindle into a position of trust, before threatening him with a loaded gun and forcing him to face his imminent death. This, of course, is not the end of the story, and a thoroughly-shaken Tindle, despite his contempt for Wyke's childish and dangerous pastimes, cooks up an unforgettable plan of revenge that'll leaving his adversary forever regretting the day he targeted a half-Italian hairdresser. The story is an enigma that even the great St. John Lord Merrydew would have loved: murder, betrayal, robbery, jewels, explosives, guns, clues and even a clown costume play a pivotal role in the plot, and the film crams so much mystery and intrigue into 140 minutes that you'll be yearning for even more.The film remains extremely true to its stage roots, with most of the film unfolding within the walls of Wyke's home, and the two main players being the only people we glimpse on screen {despite an abundance of fictional cast members thrown in to deceive even the sharpest minds}. Both actors perform brilliantly in their roles, the personalities of their respective characters fluctuating violently as the tables are turned again and again. Both were deservedly nominated for an Academy Award, making it the first of only two occasions in which a film's entire cast has received nominations {the second was for the 1975 film 'Give 'em Hell, Harry!,' starring only James Whitmore}. In 2007, Kenneth Branagh directed a much-awaited remake, starring Michael Caine as Wyke and Jude Law as Tindle. I don't know if I can expect anything as brilliant as Mankiewicz's version, but I certainly am interested in seeing it.Anthony Shaffer truly does pile one twist on top of another, and I stupefied at his ability to fool me time after time. The most memorable revelation in the film is undoubtedly the identity of Inspector Doppler. Though the credits would have us believe that he is played by Alec Cawthorne, he is, in fact, Milo Tindle in disguise, much to Wyke's surprise. I'd like to say that I had this plot-point pegged from the moment of Doppler's arrival, but that wouldn't be entirely true, since I certainly had my great doubts. At first I was certain that the Inspector's voice belonged to Michael Caine (whose accent is quite distinctive), but then I felt completely baffled as to how this was even possible, since we had just witnessed his character's murder. How was the writer going to worm himself out of this one? After a few minutes, I had completely abandoned any notions of this man being Milo Tindle, though I still could have sworn that I discerned Caine underneath that make-up. Could he simply have been playing a different character, making the film a sort of two-person stage-show? Better yet, when the revelation finally did come, I found Shaffer's solution to be brilliant, flawless, completely watertight. Bravo!",

That said, I must put a strong stress on the expression \"extraordinary\", because that's the only way one can describe the acting of the 2 actors. Only two, for all the plot, which is pretty long. Too long, possibly, and I have in my opinion (not being a cinema and even less a theater man) that the third part could have been cut away with a big gain for the story in itself and for the audience. But the way in which L. Olivier and M. Caine perform their (several\u0085) parts is simply admirable. Highly admirable. Funny but, having seen only now the movie (which is 40 years old!), I feel the strong sensation that it was there that Mr Irvine Welsh found inspiration for the main character (a pulp writer, albeit a woman) of his \"Lorraine Goes To Livingston\" (a part of \"Ecstasy\").",

            "content": "Sleuth is a screen writing master class. Rich writer Andrew (Olivier, rarely better) invites Milo (Caine, a worthy sparring partner) to his country mansion with an offer. What starts as a heist movie becomes a psychological thriller about vengeful men trying to outplay each other.Now, how do you keep a story about few characters stuck in a single location interesting? First, conflict. The movie is drenched in it. Milo - young, handsome - is the lover of Andrew's wife. Andrew claims not to care but, from the way he glances at her portrait or casually trashes her stuff, we know better. Class antagonism sizzles. To Andrew, Milo is an upstart, a social climber - and a son of immigrants, to boot. To Milo, Andrew is a pathetic relic, obsessed with games and murder mystery novels. Two men who dislike each other and yet have to interact and cooperate - this is inherently compelling to watch.Second, variety. Sleuth continuously challenges the viewer's allegiance. We are never sure whom we are rooting for - both characters are, at their core, unpleasant, reptilian sickos, but they are smart and unpredictable. Situation is fluid, always evolving; they're constantly turning the tables on each other.Third, dialogue. Each of the two leads has his own peculiar voice. Erudite Andrew asks Milo to trash the room, as to create believable signs of struggle, and adds: \"Convincing, not Carthaginian\". A bitter undertone of class resentment often slips into Milo's words: \"We come from different worlds, you and me... the only game we played was to survive... if you didn't win, you just didn't finish. Loser, lose all. You probably don't understand that\".As the plot unfolds, games become the main theme of the movie. Sex as a game (\"And marriage is the penalty!\", comments Andrew); a criminal plan temporarily becoming a playful bonding moment for the two; class-conflict as a zero-sum game; the constant attempt to show one's superiority over the other. Then games take a darker turn - somewhere between Darwin and Freud. The sadistic pleasure of knowing you've got the best hand against a hated adversary becomes the whole purpose of the game itself.9/10",

The give-and-take of this two-hander isn't as engrossing as one might hope, and red herrings abound, yet it is a meticulously designed, smoothly assured film. The sound quality does vary at times, which is important to note in a talky puzzler, but it's certainly great fun to watch Olivier at work, sniffing prudishly before digging into his next bowl of Caviar. **1/2 from ****",

The main character of the film is a middle aged British crime novelist named Andrew Wyke (Laurence Olivier) who invites a young hairdresser to his huge mansion named Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) who happens to be in love with Wyke's wife and both men try to get revenge on each other by playing dangerous games on each other throughout the rest of the movie. The film was the second of four movies that Olivier and Caine made together and in this movie they give very impressive performances which are so good it surprises me that those two actually weren't the original actors for the original Broadway production, and as a result they both got well deserved best actor Oscar nominations for their profound work. Shaffer's script along with John Addison's Oscar nominated score and especially Mankiewicz's Oscar nominated direction kept me on the edge of my seat throughout most of the entire film. I wrote in my review of \"Death on the Nile\" that I felt like I was watching a clue game in the form of a movie, but with this movie I felt the same way but the only difference being that this movie only has a 2 person cast. It is very unfortunate to me that these days Hollywood is remaking a lot of the great masterpieces of the last century but this movie was remade in 2007, and this is a movie that should never have been remade. In an interview a few months before his death Paul Newman was looking back on his career as an actor and in that very same interview he said \"No one should ever remake \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" This movie is a pure example of what mystery movies should be like and how they should be made, and is arguably one of the best mysteries I've seen that wasn't directed by Alfred Hitchcock.

I've never been too impressed by Olivier as an actor--in the Shakespeare films and \"Wuthering Heights\" he seems unable to change expression. However he was good here. He chews the scenery and goes roaring through his role. But, as I said before, he's constantly going off the subject and getting into these little speeches that quickly got annoying.

On the stage, you see the whole setting and all the characters in a scene simultaneously, and you can see actions and hear intonations that cannot be transmitted on any recording. On video, there are various cuts and scene changes, you see one person talking while not the other's simultaneous reaction to the dialog, etc.So how is the movie itself? The story is about an elder, wealthy, eccentric British man who is the author of a very successful detective character series and a mansion full of antiques and toys, and he invites a man of Italian descent who has risen from poverty to become a moderately successful hairdresser. But this isn't a social visit; the hairdresser is the author's wife's lover, and the author says at the beginning that he knows about it. Not that the author could be morally outraged; he himself has a Finnish porn star lover of his own. So what is the author's intention? The hairdresser is supposed to fake a robbery of breaking into the mansion and stealing jewels from a safe, the idea being that the hairdresser could fence the jewels for money, while the author collects the insurance. The hairdresser follows the other's instructions, but is clearly annoyed by the author's way of doing things, such as being forced to wear a clown suit.In the process, though, the author suddenly pulls a pistol on the hairdresser to reveal his true plan-to kill the hairdresser because he caught him breaking into and robbing his mansion. Not merely for the affair, but for the fact that the author despises a jumped-up poor person of Italian extraction. The hairdresser weeps with terror, and we hear the gunshot.Several days later, a policeman arrives about the disappearance of the hairdresser. He points to several bits of evidence that suggest that the author had killed him and tried to hide the body. The author gets unnerved, and finally the policeman takes off a rubber mask-he was the hairdresser is disguise. The author is initially amused, but the hairdresser wasn't-he endured the trauma of thinking he would actually be killed (the author used a blank, the hairdresser had fainted, and after awakening had wandered away). The hairdresser then humiliates the author by mocking his fictional detective, and saying that his Finnish lover told him that the author was sexually impotent. He then makes the author look for clues that could incriminate him again before the real police arrive-except they don't. The hairdresser has truly provoked the author-what will be the reaction?The big problem with the whole story is that everything is pretty predictable. We knew the \"policeman\" was really the hairdresser a mile away, for example. Also, the ending was unconvincing. Surely the hairdresser wasn't going to destroy himself just to get back at the author?There are better tension dramas to watch.",

Michael Caine is the subtle one and Laurence Olivier is deliciously over the top, having the time of his life at the prime of his life, playing a mature character with a zest for living out to destroy the man who is apparently out to destroy his marriage. Knowing that Caine and his wife (whom Olivier claims to despise) are apparently having an affair, Olivier makes an offer he knows that Caine will not be able to refuse. He gives the visiting rival the opportunity to make a lot of money by breaking into the castle where they reside and steal the unseen wife's jewelry. But to do so, Olivier must pretend to truly be interested in helping him commit this crime and gives him all of the instructions he'll need to get away with it.It's hysterically funny to watch Caine in a clown's outfit make his way across the large lawn with a ladder, tripping over everything and as he goes up the ladder, witnessing it sink into the dirt below. In a sense, this is very similar to an Ealing comedy minus the talents of Alec Guennis and Peter Sellers, and in one key scene, Olivier destroys his wife's bedroom including the breaking of a mirror as if he was trying to summon up the ghost of Maxim de winter while destroying the ghost of Rebecca. Then when Olivier reveals what he's really plotting, more delicious intrigue ensues. For Caine, it must have been difficult not to break into laughter at Olivier's antics, because Olivier is truly giving one of the best comical performances ever seen on the screen.Under the direction of Joseph L. Mankowitz (his last film, and what a way to end a fabulous career!), this film is a testimony to great editing (where he had started 30+ years before this), the use of great music (who better than Cole Porter to drive this outrageous plot aling?), and most impressively, a wonderful audacious use of art direction where you want to watch the film over and over to make sure you capture everything. The basically two-man film (with only a few other brief appearances by minor characters) shows that when done right, a play can become a great movie and still retain its artistic integrity while being extremely entertaining. No way does this feel close to two and a half hours long. In fact, Not only would I love to see this on the big screen, but I can definitely see it being revived at some point on Broadway, and I definitely revisit it live on stage.

            "content": "\"It was all a bloody game.\" That's the final line of Joseph L. Mankiewicz's Sleuth, adapted by Anthony Shaffer from his own play, and after the grueling power games that ensue for over two hours on screen it resonates in a powerful fashion. This is a tale of two polar opposite men whose collision with each other provides for a whirlwind of laughs, tears and emotional and physical catastrophe. Andrew Wyke (Laurence Olivier) is a highly intelligent writer of detective stories, and when he invites Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) to his home, he has more on his mind than just a simple discussion of Tindle's plans to steal Wyke's wife away from him. No, he wants to play a game and this game is an elaborate design to determine whether or not he deems Tindle appropriate for the task of taking this woman away from him.What follows, of course, is not something that either man was capable of imagining and the two of them put each other through the ringer of distress, competing in games of power and intelligence over and over again. Wyke's superiority complex places himself high above Tindle, immediately talking down to the man as if he has something to prove and Tindle responds in turn, his arrogance and working-class pride giving him a need to do just that, to prove that he can handle Wyke's games and participate in kind. It's a sharp, poignant dissection of man and the kind of twisted battles they'll go through in order to gain respect, from themselves and others.They employ strategies to humiliate the other, promoting their own superiority even though there is no one else in the room.Their pride and arrogance force them to demonstrate their masculinity, their virility, but the irony of it all is that they are only doing it for one another. It seems as though it's set up as a competition for one woman, but instead the focus of these men is only to defeat the other in their treacherous game, hardly even mentioning the woman that has brought them together. They become so enraptured in their game with each other that they don't even have a concern for her, or for anyone else at all. The game takes some very wicked and twisted turns, all while exploring themes of impotence, pride and many other things.The theme that I found the most fascinating personally was Shaffer's focus on class warfare. Wyke is of the upper crust, the rich writer holed up in his mansion secluded from the world, and Tindle from the working-class, coming from nothing and now running his own hair salon. The dialogue is sharp and precise and many times the two attack one another in regards to their social status, Tindle mocking Wyke's inability to understand regular human beings and Wyke regarding Tindle as \"a jumped-up pantry boy who doesn't know his place\". The constant tug of war between them is consistently fascinating, taking the rare route of becoming even more engaging the further it goes on.I'm always intrigued by intimate studies of this nature that confine themselves to a very small group of characters and one primary location, but so often they are brought to their own folly by the restrictions of that very set up. They start off strong but lose focus and my interest wanes. Here however things only become more and more intriguing as these two continue their game, thanks in no small part to the revelatory performances from Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Caine fills his Tindle with so much resentment and rage towards Wyke, and watching that anger creep to the surface is wickedly compelling. He goes through a wide range of emotions, from utter hopelessness to seething arrogance and Caine is able to capture this all with a fluidity that never once allows the character to stop being believable.Olivier, in turn, is much more calm and cerebral, always considering himself one step ahead even when he knows that he is behind. His work is an internal one to match Caine's outward approach and the primary reason the film succeeds is due to their skills as actors here. Shaffer takes them through moments of bizarre comedy, intellectual class warfare and brutal clashes of masculinity and each actor constantly ups the other, just as the characters themselves do. In the end, the game is just as compelling for the audience as it is for the characters, a wickedly smart and twisted endeavor with a stunner of a finale.",

            "content": "You can tell this movie was based on a play because it's all set in one place and there's a clear turning point in the middle. The performances are theatrical, not over-the-top but with wide ranges of emotions. There are so many swings of power between the main characters. They are cocky and childishly gleeful when they're in control and miserable or desperate when they're being taken advantage of. It's impressive that Sleuth consistently maintains our interest with so few actors and only one location.I'm not sure there's much depth to the story. It's more psychological, about the way we manipulate each-other or try to get the upper hand. It reminds me of The Prestige where two magicians try to outsmart each- other, weaving traps for each-other, hopelessly falling into them and growing ever more spiteful. The ironic thing with so many of these endless, spiraling conflicts is how similar the two parties are. Palestine and Israel, Serbia and Croatia, Borden and Angier, Andrew Wyke and Milo Tindle. Why must they be antagonistic when they have so many common interests and could help each-other immensely?The mansion has a personality of its own. The dolls, toys and collectibles are given screen-time of their own. It would be a mistake to read too much into those close-ups. It works simply in creating mood and giving us time to think. Plus, it adds a bit of creepiness. As if all the events are being watched. There are certainly some aspects of horror to this movie. The music is nice as well although I don't think there was much. The cinematography is simple but effective. It feels non-intrusive but makes the scenes more dynamic somehow.This movie plays out a bit like a mystery thriller, a whodunnit. An investigator comes regarding a possible murder but indeed, the plot thickens. It's hard not to give anything away. But movies shouldn't lean too heavily on twists lest they are predicted and that was an issue here. The movie is perhaps too clever for itself. It becomes a pattern and loses meaning and realism to the point that I didn't believe anything the characters said or did. For all I knew, it was just another part of their game.I actually expected more twists than there were. So I felt a bit let down. It seems to go 3/4 of the way and then back down. There's no clear message, it's just entertainment, but then why not bring down the house with a great surprise ending? Nevertheless, Sleuth manages to keep things tense and interesting all the way through. The directions it takes you are certainly creative and unexpected. It gradually evolves through many different atmospheres. Laughter gives way to shouting or crying or relief. The actors do a very good job. But it's all merely an exercise, albeit a fun and unique one.",

Just as you thought you were following what is happening, Wyke (Olivier) and Milo (Caine) are pulling up a new dirty trick. On that ground, and on the ground of the leading actors' great performances and wits, the movie is exemplary. Although it is a minimal-cast, minimal-scenery, theater-type-of-film, it manages to get you through without getting you bored; on the contrary, the constant surprises popping up are keeping you alert all the time.However, after more than 30 years since it was filmed, \"Sleuth\" definitely shows its age. It is not the typical signs of the late 60's-early 70's that seem dated now (dressing styles, background music, etc.), although they, too, play a role: What seems out of context today is the whole concept of the snobbish British noble, who despises and shows contempt for the young Italian hairdresser who has the hots for his wife. In today's egalitarian society, with the EU blurring differences between Englishmen and Italians, and with nobility being on a decaying path, these cliches seem totally dated.Still, one cannot deny that this is a classic which is very enjoyable to be watched. In brief, 8/10.",

            "content": "A wealthy detective novelist invites his wife's lover in his mansion and traps him in his clever mind games as a part of revenge. Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, both two legendary British actors, put prominent piece of performance in their puzzle-plays. Olivier remains exquisite to toy Caine with his intellect and gamesmanship. His superiority complex and snobbery represent the pitch- perfect image of the then British upper class society. Grandiose Olivier can not accept such defeat from a middle class hairdresser who has snatched his wife. Therefore, he plots Caine to participate in a battle of games to humiliate him utterly. Olivier is flawless to portray his pompousness and obsession to his predominance. It was actually poor luck for him to miss Oscar that year as he got Marlon Brando, The Godfather (1972), as his contender. However, Caine also comes ravishing in his ways of treatment in the intellectual warfare. Caine is magnetic to reply to all mockeries and humiliation, made by Olivier, though his acting can not surpass Olivier's superb appearance at length.Anthony Shaffer, one of the mightiest 20th century English playwrights, creates an intriguing screenplay, full of wits and aggressive humors. Both Olivier and Caine seem natural in darting each other with those witty dialogues. The setting provides a perfect theatrical tide throughout the film. Above all, there is no other option valid to admire Joseph Leo Mankiewicz for this mind-blowing charade. He is always grand at his place as a director. Additional hype arouses for Sleuth as it is Mankiewicz's last film. To conclude, this one is an obvious recommendation for all classic mystery fans.",

            "content": "People who think games of cat-and-mouse were popularized by modern series like frickin' Death Note need to take a good hard look at not only themselves, but films like Sleuth. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz (All About Eve) and written by Anthony Schaffer (Frenzy, The Wicker Man), this film is classic game of cat and mouse jam-packed with memorable scenes and dialogue.The game/film starts with hairdresser Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) visiting mystery writer Andrew Wyke (Laurence Olivier) at his large country house. Milo is dating Andrew's wife Marguerite, you see, so already we've got a conflict of interest. Andrew, however, has no qualms about divorcing her, but doesn't want to drown in alimony in the process. Marguerite has expensive tastes, you see. After getting to know (and dislike) each other a bit, Andrew proposes a plan: Milo will rob some valuable jewels in his house which he can then pawn off in Amsterdam while Andrew collects the insurance money. All goes well, until\u0085 Honestly, I could describe what happens then, but that plot twist occurs around the one hour mark, so that would ruin a bit too much of the fun.Being a game of cat and mouse, the film has lots of fun with familiar tropes in this genre. I always sensibly chuckle whenever collecting insurance money is a major plot element. The fact that Andrew is himself a mystery writer only makes it better. The film's ending is also a wonderfully literal visualization of that good old mystery trope, the last laugh. Thankfully, however, the self-awareness doesn't ruin the suspense. Quite the opposite. There's a lot of tension hidden under the veritable mountain of witty lines.I will say that I didn't love Sleuth after first seeing it many years ago. It's mostly to do with something involving a disguise. At the time, I immediately identified him for who he really was so the eventual reveal was disappointing. I always assumed it was supposed to be this big twist for the audience, but since it failed miserably, I felt disappointed with the film. Having watched it again recently, I figure the joke is supposed to be on the other character and not the audience. The audience, rather than being surprised, can anticipate the other guy's reaction when he discovers he's been deceived. At least, I hope that's the case.Now, the acting. It's easily half the film. The film is roughly 2 hours and 15 minutes long and it all mostly takes place in Andrew's house, but it never gets boring and it's precisely due to the acting and the witty screenplay. The entire film is predicated upon Milo and Andrew verbally sparring and it doesn't disappoint. Both Caine and Olivier don't miss a single beat and the script's supply of morbidly delightful lines is virtually limitless. Mankiewicz's direction also helps. He makes up for the lack of variety in locales by occasionally cutting to quick shots of the house's bizarre decorations, which include an array of dolls, to reinforce the sense of dread underlying the proceedings.As to why the film is still impressive, I assume it's to do with a combination of witty dialogue, acting and\u0085its brand of cruelty. It's not so much in what they force each other to do, but what they force each other to feel. It's why Sleuth is such a funny, but also cruel film even by today's standards. Today, cruelty is primarily exemplified by physical pain as seen in the Saw films, etc. Sleuth is the exact opposite. It's about humiliation and inflicting as much psychological pain on each other.But make no mistake, Sleuth is also very funny. You have to ignore your expectations of typical dramas and go into Sleuth expecting a game, albeit a morbid one. The film is at its core quite ridiculous, but that's part of the deal\u0085and the fun.",

Well, it was worth the wait.Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier feed off each other in these visceral performances, it was hard to judge who was better! It made me think of 'The Deer Hunter' where Chris Walken and Robert De Niro are so brilliantly cast against each other, or even Glengarry Glen Ross where the ensemble cast is truly peerless.Caine's performance as Tindle is seminal, you can feel his hunger for a victory, to pull one over Olivier's snobby gentry. Similarly, the film is crackling with tension, down to Olivier's portrayal of Andrew Wyke - seething with arrogance, classism and as a symbol of the ever-declining bourgeoisie. What really impressed, however, was how funny the script managed to be without losing the drama, something that isn't easy to achieve.The two performances, however, are not enough - it is Anthony Shaffer's subliminal screenplay, from his stage play, that is the glue that binds this together. The dialogue is fantastic throughout and doesn't falter, whilst Caine and Olivier deliver their lines and interactions completely naturally.Cinematographically the film is excellently shot, with the insinuation of Wyke's plainly freaky marionettes and clutter as watching over the charade between Caine and Olivier. There is also a great score to accompany, adding to the thriller aspect of this piece.I won't go over the plot because the only way to enjoy this film is to see it, all you need to know is it is a tale of jealous, competitiveness and revenge.'Sleuth' is a master piece, it is witty and sharp and makes the viewer think, whilst Olivier and Caine chuck out performances that easily rank along the best they have done, before or after. So, to reiterate, it was completely worth the wait.",

It dazzles with its grandeur, it is believed no rival, and lives on a pedestal constructed mentally, failing to recognize that among the \"small\" only he looks up and down, there is always an individual surprise, one day, know put in place. Because the law is precise existential: what goes up, down, and always in that way - or those - that one day you will bring down... just when you feel higher. Because when it climbs a mountain, at some point reaches a peak, and as life is movement, then on what follows is the descent. This man understands the humble and wise, but the arrogant, but I see in others, always argue that he is the exception.Andrew Wyke is like one of these gentlemen.Writer of detective stories in which fatigue has been underestimated until the work of the officers, being invariably a researcher amateur - his alter ego - who solves every case, lives alone in a huge house where there are many more sophisticated games and where he revels challenging themselves and, from time to time, challenging anyone who believes it's worthy rival.Their games are sophisticated, eccentric and, arguably with a pinch of Satan and evil, because the plot resembles reality cruelly. The last guest has just arrived, is called Milo Tindle, the lover of his wife, and has the look of an Italian air of perfect guinea pig.

In fact I posit that the interview with Anthony Shaffer on the DVD is more entertaining than the whole film. Mankiewicz was a talented man and so was Shaffer, and so were the actors, but this is dated. It's talky, easy to figure out, and mostly something for fans of theater, Mank, and Olivier and Caine. The editing is particularly jarring, with quick cuts of inanimate objects inserted rapidly, something David Lynch does much more poetically in his work, most notably, Twin Peaks. This would never be filmed today, unless it was for Lifetime, with the leads changed for women and the script tightened, and reworked. It's a rambling old dinosaur of a play/script - it thunders along kicking up dust and then heaves its last breath and lays there wheezing on the ground, leaving this viewer wondering if it ever should have been translated to film. I'm sure it worked quite well as a stage play but in the cinematic day and age of Fight Club, The Sixth Sense, and The Others, it's old and musty and easy to figure out, (does anyone not know that's Michael Caine as the Inspector Doppler in the second act???) and if it does fool you, it's only for a second and not to very great effect. Deathtrap, also with Caine is a subtle retelling of this tale, only tighter, and with a woman character added. And both Deathtrap and Sleuth borrow Heavily from Diabolique. Heavily.If you do purchase or rent the DVD, watch the extra feature with Shaffer. It's Magic, which is what I expected from the film - but its time has come and gone. It has wrinkles and liver spots and will do little more than bore most viewers under 60. I know I'll get reamed for this, but it had its time and even then, in my humble opinion, it was over rated.If you like Olivier, there's a lot of better choices out there, as well as Caine. If you want a more lively 1970's work from Shaffer, try Frenzy or The Wicker Man. As for J. Mank, All About Eve was made 56 Years Ago (!!) and still holds up quite nicely as a savage black comedy of words, forever a monument to the man as a writer and director.

It is now open for public visits.An internet \"virtual tour\" is possible by visiting WWW.Athelhampton.Co.Uk/ Sir William Martyn had the current Great Hall built in about 1493. A West Wing and Gatehouse were added in 1550, but in 1862 the Gatehouse was demolished.Sir Robert Long bought Athelhampton House in 1665 from Sir Ralph Bankes. In 1684 an attempt was made by the court to sequester the estate from the then owner, James Long Esquire (son of Sir James Long, 2nd Baronet), to recover a debt, but this seems to have been unsuccessful. The estate passed down through the Long family to William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley (Viscount Wellesley, later 5th Earl of Mornington), who sold it in 1848 to George Wood.In 1891, the house was acquired by the antiquarian Alfred de Lafontaine, who carried out restoration to the interior and added the North Wing in 1920-21.At the same time de Lafontaine engaged Inigo Thomas to create one of England's great gardens as a series of \"outdoor rooms\" inspired by the Renaissance. 20 acres (8.1 ha) of formal gardens are encircled by the River Piddle, and consist of eight walled gardens with numerous fountains and pavilions, plus a balustraded terrace, statues, obelisks and vistas through gate piers. Great Court contains 12 giant yew pyramids set around the pool by the great terrace.The lawn to the west has an early 16th-century circular dovecote, and the south terrace features a vast Magnolia grandiflora and a Banksian rose. Pear trees cover the old walls and support roses and Clematis.Athelhampton has been owned by three generations of the Cooke family, the present owners. It was the setting for the 1972 film \"Sleuth\".--------------------------- The movie lasts almost 2 1/2 hours and is hard to watch and get enthusiastic about in spite of the very good actor work of the two movie stars who are the only actors seen in the movie.The lovely \"Athelhampton Hall\" setting is sort of the \"third actor\" in the show, and is one of the reasons the movie's pacing is slowed down (a small part of the movie was shot in London movie studios, but I would guess less than 10% was).Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine are always worth seeing....they are two of England's best movie actors, and the problem parts of the movie are greatly forgivable simply because of the good work the two stars provide.That said, there are indeed many \"problem parts\" of \"Sleuth\" (1972), and the characters presented by the writer are not interesting or sufficiently endearing to justify the long time the viewer is asked to spend with them.It is important to like the stars of any movie, and that includes villains, and people who engage in villainy.Neither of the 2 main (only) characters in \"Sleuth\" (1972) is sufficiently likable to keep viewers interested, regardless of the superb job Olivier and Caine do with what they are given.Laurence Olivier probably owned a large percentage of the movie....Michael Caine was just beginning to act in movies he also owned (\"Get Carter\" [1971] was the first movie Caine produced and owned, partly).\"Sleuth\" (1972) shows off Olivier's actor talent, which Olivier was no doubt happy with....and since he was the boss of the production, questions about the movie being a big \"ego trip\" for Olivier were probably not raised, neither, likely, were objections to the movie's shortcomings....too long, too slow, too obvious, not well written in many ways.What the viewer and movie historian are left with is the fact that \"Sleuth\" (1972) is a very important and famous movie starring two of the most important movie actors of the 20th century, and at the same time, it is a mediocre movie in many ways.It is technically and historically interesting, and not more.For people (I am one) interested in \"stage plays made into movies which remain interesting historical examples of well done stage plays,\" this movie is worth knowing about and seeing at least once.BTW, stage plays like \"Sleuth\" (1972)....a play made into a movie..is arguably an art form which many people agree probably died around 1980....see the excellent documentary titled \"Broadway: The Golden Age\" [2004] which presents this view.Any movie which stars Laurence Olivier is important (also true of any movie starring Michael Caine), and therefore, \"Sleuth\" (1972) is important......but this doesn't mean it's a good movie.\"Sleuth\" (1972) is a bad movie with good qualities and excellent actors.....not the same thing as a good movie, sadly.--------------- Tex (David) Allen is a SAG-AFTRA accredited movie actor.Email him at TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com",

This is not a detriment to the film, which is a delight from start to finish. The film's sets are excellent, and the little trinkets and games scattered in the sets in the English country home add to the film.This film does not follow the traditional mystery mold of Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle, but rather the rivalry and \"battle of wits\" between Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Olivier plays Andrew Wyke, an eccentric detective fiction author who does wonderfully amusing impressions of stock characters from mystery novels. Caine is excellent as the \"young upstart\" Milo Tindle, who seeks the hand of Wyke's wife.Ultimately the fun of \"Sleuth\" is in trying to anticipate where the story will turn and how far Wyke and Tindle will go. If you are a fan of mysteries, \"Sleuth\" is essential viewing because of its engaging plot and performances.",

Andrew wants his revenge and begins a cat-and-mouse game that sees Milo put through an emotional wringer before the weekend is over.Andrew, a man who likes both practical jokes and challenging people with his brilliant mind, uses every trick in the book he can to get Milo to suffer, but Milo has a few tricks of his own and uses them to great advantage to make Andrew suffer as well. It's a game of mental chess and we're always kept guessing from minute to minute as to what will happen next.The director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, keeps the film moving at a brisk pace, and with only two characters on screen at all time, he has chosen two of the best actors to do the job.Sir Laurence Olivier, as Andrew, and Michael Caine, as Milo, act each other off the screen, without either of them over-acting. Both men thoroughly deserved their Best Actor Oscar nominations, and Michael Caine in particular is so good I think perhaps he should have won the award itself (unfortunately, Michael lost out to Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER).SLEUTH is filled with witty dialogue, clever plot twists and plenty of \"in\" jokes. And John Addison's amusingly apt music score is an added bonus as well.A brilliant film version of a brilliant play!",

It is visually horrendous, set in an English country house filled with automatons and games of all kinds - the continuous close-up shots of these games between plot twists are extremely boring and show poor film-making. But then visual beauty was never an aim of Mankiewicz's, vide THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN's ugliness. It is also quite hard to believe the underlying 'social' antagonism between Andrew and Milo: the film would have been better off, for me, as a pure trick, without a somewhat artificial reference to class and race divides. They are not really necessary as the principles of humiliation, rather than the reasons for it, are brilliantly exposed.Still, if you like mind games and huis clos this film is for you.

            "content": "I have vivid memories of Anthony Shaffer's \"Sleuth\" as it was the first play (as opposed to pantomime or variety show) that I ever saw in London's West End; my class were taken to see it by our teacher as an end-of-term treat. The film adaptation sticks closely to the play. The plot centres on Andrew Wyke, a writer of detective novels in the style of Agatha Christie. Wyke's marriage has broken down, and his wife, Marguerite, has left him for Milo Tindle, a half-Italian London hairdresser Wyke invites Tindle to his country manor house, where he makes an extraordinary proposition. He suggests that Tindle should steal some valuable jewelry and sell it in order to live happily with Marguerite, while Wyke will claim the insurance in order to live happily with his new mistress Thea. Tindle, whose business is in financial difficulties, readily agrees, and the two men act out a scenario whereby Tindle, disguised as a clown, breaks into the house, blows open the safe and obtains the jewels. Then Wyke drops his bombshell. The whole scheme has been an elaborate ruse; his purpose has been to lure Tindle into a position where he can legally shoot him as an intruder. I don't want to reveal much more of the plot, as the effectiveness of the story, whether on stage or on the screen, depends very much upon the audience being surprised. I can, however, say that the rest of the film can be seen as a power-struggle between Wyke and Tindle with first one and then the other gaining the upper hand. The two antagonists are very different, both in character and in social background. Although Wyke's literary career has been highly successful, it is clear from Laurence Olivier's patrician manner that he is from the moneyed upper classes and that writing is not his sole source of wealth. His Wiltshire mansion may well have been inherited, not purchased with the royalties from his books. It is notable that his fictional detective, St. John Lord Merridew, is himself an aristocratic amateur, with the ability to solve cases that leave the police baffled. Wyke seems to have a deep contempt for the police, possibly because most British policemen are drawn from working-class or lower-middle-class backgrounds. Another facet of Wyke's character is his delight in games of all kinds. The living room of his house contains, as well as a collection of antique automata, a snooker table, a dart board, a chess set and even a set for the ancient Egyptian game of Senet. His power-struggle with Tindle is disguised as a series of elaborate games. Tindle is similar to a number of Michael Caine characters from this period. He can be seen as an Alfie who has risen in the world or as a more socially respectable version of Charlie Croker from \"The Italian Job\", although the alacrity with which he accepts Wyke's suggestion that they should commit fraud suggests that \"more respectable\" does not equate to \"more honest\". Like Alfie, he dresses smartly but conservatively in a blazer and slacks. Whereas Wyke represents the traditional upper class, Tindle represents the new, rising meritocracy of the \"swinging London\" of the late sixties and early seventies. One of Shaffer's themes is the conflict between these two classes. Wyke's dislike of Tindle is not rooted in sexual jealousy; he freely admits that he no longer loves Marguerite and will be quite happy to divorce her. Rather, Wyke resents Tindle for his lowly social origins and foreign ancestry; he would not mind losing his wife to another member of the upper classes, but cannot stand losing her to \"a jumped-up pantry boy who doesn't know his place\". The acting is very good, as one might expect from a film which stars two of Britain's most distinguished actors, and both Olivier and Caine were nominated for \"Best Actor\" Oscars. (Neither won, which is perhaps not surprising seeing as they were up against Marlon Brando in \"The Godfather\"). Rather surprisingly, neither would have been Shaffer's first choice for their roles; he would have preferred Anthony Quayle and Alan Bates, but director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, whose last film this was to be, went with Olivier and Caine. Despite the quality of the acting, I was rather surprised to see this film in the IMDb top 250. One of Shaffer's points is that the traditional country house detective story, as practised by Wyke and his real-life equivalents, is outdated, snobbish and artificial. I would not disagree with that assessment, but it has always seemed to me that the charge of artificiality could equally well be made against Shaffer's own highly stylised play. This is not the sort of play which lends itself to opening-up; nearly all the action takes place in the interior of Wyke's house, although one or two scenes are set in its grounds. (Athelhampton near Dorchester was used for the exteriors). Shaffer's theatrical tricks tend to work better in the theatre than they do in the more naturalistic medium of the cinema. I haven't seen Kenneth Branagh's recent remake, but the original film, despite two fine acting contributions, strikes me as a rather dated, artificial curiosity. 6/10",

Originally a stage play, it comes across brilliantly, nevertheless, as a film with those two consummate pros, Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine.The gripping plot chronicles an elaborate game of cat and mouse played over a weekend by two men...Andrew Wyke, an upper class author, and Milo Tindle, a working class hair salon chain owner. Their common interest is Wyke's wife, Marguerite, with whom Tindle has been having an affair. Wyke is quite happy to divorce his wife, but feels slighted by the affair and wants his revenge. The drama begins with his alleged plans to pull off an insurance scam by setting up a mock burglary of jewelry. The plot twists and turns then unfold as the rival pair, with ever increasing momentum and tension, each endeavor to outwit the other...potentially with deadly consequences. This clever cat and mouse game certainly outwitted me. Some reviewers claim they could figure out exactly what was afoot all the time, but all the trickery and deception generally managed to trick and deceive me. I must say no more.The movie's success depends mainly on the brilliance of its two actors, both Oscar nominees for their roles. Lawrence Olivier is masterful (as usual) as the educated, cunning older squire, Wyke, with Michael Caine equally stellar here as the charming young lover, Tindle. The pair reveal both their true character traits, as well as the ones they wish to convey to their opponent, as they spar during this game. The dialogue is brilliant, and the chemistry between the lead actors dynamic.An extremely clever and entertaining film. Truly, they don't make them like this anymore; such witty dialogue is unknown in today's cinema. I'd like to see Sleuth in its original form on stage as well.",

Suffice it to say the rest of the plot involves some of the most original, wittiest writing to support a series of games between these two very different yet so very similar men. Anthony Shaffer's play is outstanding and has perhaps some of the best dialog for a play of this type. The wit rolls off of Olivier's and Caine's tongues with gusto and humorous vitriol. Director Joe Mankiewicz does a super job directing these two giant talents and the sets and props are first-rate. In fact Wyke's entire house is really a character in and of itself. But make no mistake here, this is Olivier's and Caine's show. They are the hands that make the clock move. Each is excellent in his own way. Caine shows a very convincing range of feelings and shows his great versatility. Olivier is mesmerizing and utters each line with absolute conviction and full of pith, charm, and innuendo. Olivier's character would not or could not be effective had Olivier played it any other way. He should have won the Oscar that year for Best Actor!

            "content": "How much of the average American population would be entertained by watching two dull, lifeless middle-aged men play a chess game for 2 hours and 18 minutes? I can pretty much assure that number is pretty small. I personally love to play chess, but if you were to force me to sit and watch people do it, I'd feel like committing suicide after the first thirty minutes. That's about how I felt watching Sleuth. The entire movie is absolutely nothing but two men playing a dull game from the opening to the closing. There camera never leaves the house for the entire runtime. The most diversity in the entire movie is some minor clothing changes and some facial expressions. The entire movie is straight-up dialogue and nothing else. The entire movie is two long, dull scenes, with one scene change near the middle. If you have less of an attention span than the average person with Down syndrome, you'll be bored to the point of nausea long before the 30-minute mark. There is about as much entertainment value in Sleuth as there is in watching a tree stump rot, and that may even be an overstatement, because at least doing that you can use your own imagination. Here, the most imagination you get is two men, four walls, and an insane amount of bland conversation. If that describes what you consider an entertaining movie, Sleuth will keep you on the edge of your seat for sure.People would argue that the conversation scenes I reference carry the \"clever plotting\". In other words, the conversation scenes carry a cute, predictably plot-twisted story revolving around all the clich\u00e9s that we've seen since the camera was invented. There is nothing clever about the plot. Sure it has a couple twists that will make you shed an \"Awe, that was cute!\" smile, but they're the same plot twists you've seen countless times. This is a clich\u00e9d murder story, folks. It's not some hyper-original idea. If you saw a single Sherlock Holmes episode as a kid, you've seen everything this movie has to offer. If the plot were truly clever or creative, it would do something new or different.The other problem with the plot\u0097if you even call it a plot; I don't\u0097is that it's so predictable. No, you may not have any lead-ons as to who-killed-who or who's-dead-who's-not, but does it really matter? The outcome is always the same. You're always told the answer, and there's always only two options. It's the most basic immature plot line known to man. I've seen cartoons that put this plot to thumb-sucking shame. Who really cares anymore? I overuse the metaphor in my reviews, but a movie this unoriginal is like a joke you heard in kindergarten and then someone tries to make you laugh at that joke when you're 80-years-old. It's ineffective. It's pointless. Even if you force a laugh, you still feel annoyed.I understand this movie was made in the 70s. People will defend it by saying, \"There was nothing like it when it came out!\" and they're dead wrong. All their doing is defending their deep sense of nostalgia. In reality, this movie was just as unoriginal in 1972 as it is in 2009. And do you know what's sadder? Movies just like it are still being made, and they're still getting acclaim. It makes me sick. We don't need another paper-thing whodunit murder mystery with the same predictable results. What the mystery genre needs is maturity. Instead of pumping out more kindergarten level plot line movies like this, why not actually think of an, you know, actual STORY to support the mystery. That's something directors/writers obviously didn't get back in the 70s, and it's something they still don't get today. Instead of focusing on plots, why not focus on STORY? Overall, Sleuth is a complete waste of time. It has a couple of intelligent high-brow lines, but I could get those from my dying grandfather. Why do I have to watch a pointless movie to hear them? And, similarly, I could get the same predictable level of mystery of watching this movie from playing the Clue board game\u0097alone. Why do I have to watch a pointless movie to do so? The more I think about it, I cannot find a single redeeming value in Sleuth whatsoever. It's long, boring, dull, pointless, lame, slow, uninteresting, paper-thin, predictable, annoying, pathetic . . .And most of all, Sleuth is exactly the same story you've seen hundreds of times, yet it expects you to be enthralled. Now THAT is a clever joke.0/10",

Needless to say considering the sort of very intricate dialog required for this film's atmosphere, the closer attention to cinematography, and just overall the very highly ambitious construction around such a basic plot...there is an enormous amount of work on display in this piece, and about half the film relies on both lead actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier who produce masterful performances, and whether too theatrical for the tastes of some, there's no denying the excellence manifested throughout this eerie comedy. So there's no questioning the cumulative quality of all those elements, from the acting to the cinematography, the fine structure, and the very well done job for such a limited setting. But the problem here is the film is arguably 30 minutes too long, not that the film even stretches its scenes but rather adds just too much in the end. There's just too much \"Sleuth\" in 'Sleuth'. The film feels like it's about a couple of mystery-thrillers in one, there are just too many elements in the story, too many full acts put together, it's just too heavy for one single motion picture and the whole point of it could've been delivered without some of its extra weight. As we're through a good 1hr30, there comes another full act to the play with its own tensions, events... it's a little bit of overkill really. But this doesn't take away the great cinema work besides that aspect. It's just that when past that point of smooth rhythm and a few good twists already, the viewer is left with the ending as a final impression as the conclusion of the whole piece; and one could very well feel the last chapter here is on the side of excess spoiling an otherwise grand coup of cinema.",

It's a piece of p, he is supposed to have told Anthony Quayle, while railing at him for appearing in the original stage performance. I can't help feeling that Larry eventually leapt at the opportunity of taking the p out of Shaffer by performing in it himself. He gives the hammiest ever act as the pass\u00e9 whodunnit writer, capturing every nuance of clich\u00e9, in wild exaggeration.

Two of the best actors that movie and stage business has ever brought, each from his own generation; the new vs the old one. A clash of talent. And not a smash.",

In the close intimacy of live theatre the audience are pulled into the story; sucked this way and that by the twisting eddies of the plot and sent reeling on a rollercoaster of emotions for whom you should have sympathy with.Therefore I faced the film with much trepidation and scepticism.  How could they possibly transpose a theatre piece which has only a cast of 2 (3) set in maybe 2 scenes on to the silver screen.  How will they get away with film close-ups of disguises and impersonations which worked so well on stage due to the distance of the actors to the audience (It could be. . . but you just can't tell).Well, they did it - that's all I can say.  Olivier and Caine are supreme in this movie, the sets are beautifully lavish and show what couldn't be shown on the stage.  The problems of impersonation are dealt with fantastically (yes, you think you know it's Caine, but what is he up to and why?)  I was just bowled over.I would still class this film in my top ten all time favourites and if anyone is considering a modern remake (as seems the rage at the moment) just forget it.  The vision, acting and set design of this film are an inspired combination which we shall not see the like of ever again.",

            "content": "I believe the title of Sleuth may be misleading. When I first approached it I wasn't aware of the stage play it was based on and thought the film was going to be a standard \"whodunit?\" and thus wasn't expecting much from it. I couldn't have been more wrong. Watching it I soon discovered it to be a different film entirely, a giant mind game, a battle of wits and a tale of revenge. I've never seen a film quite like Sleuth before. The exploits between Michael Caine and Laurence Oliver trying to outwit each other with the plot's many twists, surprises and under the direction of Joseph L. Mankiewicz' (a master at handling dialogue) makes for a film that's hard to forget.Watching this film I quickly came to realize that Caine and Olivier may be the only two cast members throughout, which had me thinking if they could carry the film to the very end by themselves it will be nothing short of an acting marvel, so I was disappointed when the movie introduced what appeared to be a third cast member, Alec Cawthrone as Inspector Doppler; I felt the movie was making a mistake by doing so. That was until it turned out that Inspector Doppler was Michael Caine in disguise the whole time, yes, there's no such actor as Alec Cawthrone, he was simply created for the film's credits. I'm not sure how many people will be as perceptible as I was but the movie successfully fooled this viewer. On second viewing I can clearly see Caine through the disguise but I'll always have the memory to cherish of being spellbound the first time round from seeing Caine taking off all that makeup, which itself makes up appreciate the art form. Sleuth actually has a fake cast list in the opening credits in an attempt to fool the audience; this includes three other nonexistent actors, one of which is named after the character Eve Channing from Joseph L. Mankiewicz' earlier film All About Eve. Up until the film's very last scene in which police sirens and knocking on the door can be heard, I was on the edge of my seat hoping the movie would not introduce another cast member.I've always liked Michael Caine but Sleuth greatly increased my respect for him, while also making me a fan Laurence Olivier; their ability to carry this film is nothing short of phenomenal. Milo Tindle is one of Caine's more effeminate roles, a hairdresser who even takes joy in wearing a piece of women's clothing at one point. Olivier, on the other hand, is the given the opportunity to have tons of fun with his role of Andrew Wyke, doing impressions and playing dress up with another grown man and with all those gadgets, gizmos and games everywhere, it's always a pleasure to look into the background of Andrew Wyke's manor. Likewise, the humor that comes from seeing a man being convinced that dressing as a clown is the way to go when doing a staged crime, has me laughing nonstop through the entire charade.",

I didn't really like this film. I blame it on the director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz. The blocking of the action and the sets are brilliant, the actors give 100 percent (but no more, mind you), and the drive-by dialogue is explosive, but it's the effort by Mankiewicz to make the film just a bit cuter, artsier (enough with the reaction shots of Olivier's toys, already!) that blunted the brilliance.I know I'm nit-picking, but the artsy-fartsy really did stunt the fun of watching two magicians tell their tale.",

Okay, so Olivier is as mannered as always and Caine still a tad green, these things are easy to overlook because of the quality of the writing, the 'feel' of a house given over to game-playing and the several twists in the plot.

            "content": "I'm just going to come right out and say it - this movie was ridiculous. That's a simple fact of the matter. Originally a play written by Anthony Shaffer in 1970, it's a major suspension of belief. Here's a brief synopsis: an eccentric crime fiction writer, Andrew Wyke (Laurence Oliver) invites British-Italian hairdresser, Milo Tindle, to his country manor house (played by Michael Caine, who couldn't pass for half Italian even by fictional standards, but I guess he was cast for the role because this film wasn't meant to be taken seriously). Andrew knows Milo was having an affair with his wife. What ensues is a series of mind games and crazy antics. By all means, I do understand why some people think this movie is boring. Nothing much happens besides the two of them talking. Not to mention, the silliness might make some viewers lose interest. It starts out with Andrew telling Milo he wants to stage a jewel robbery at his home. He has Milo wear a clown costume and climb up a ladder to one of the windows. I usually can't stand movies that lack realism to the tenth degree, but the acting from Laurence Oliver and Michael Caine was absolutely brilliant, and that makes it easy to look past the absence of logic. You can tell they started out on the stage. It's common for UK actors to give performances in a theater environment before they do films, and I feel like that's why they're able to portray such a wide range of emotions. Andrew drove Milo so insane to the point that he started crying, and then he shouted at Andrew. When that happened I was like whoa... For one moment I forgot they were playing characters and thought they were actually two men arguing over a woman. Just as a warning - it is two hours long, which to be honest, I found to be kind of annoying. It was soooo hard not to fast forward, but I couldn't help it. One of the scenes I basically knew what was going to happen, so I skipped over that. There's no way I was going to sit through the whole 2 hours. Overall, I found it enjoyable. The story was absurd, but there wasn't any potty humor or shock value crap, unlike movies nowadays. It was funny how they turned the tables on each other. That was my first time watching a film with Laurence Oliver in it. Even from one film, it's evident he was the type of actor who really made his characters come alive. This is a must watch, especially if you're a Michael Caine fan. With the exception of Second Hand Lions, after the mid 1970s his movies started going downhill. For example, Hannah and Her Sisters and Blame It On Rio. I've never watched either one, just read about them, but that was enough for me. He plays highly unlikable characters: a man who cheats on his wife with her sister, and a father who has relations with his teenage daughter's friend. How gross and disturbing! He's a talented actor, but I think later in his career he became desperate for money. Sleuth is the most clever film he's ever done. Trust me, it's worth setting aside 2 hours.",

Larry greets his play-nemesis, uncomfortably offering vodka and tonic, of which there is none, obliging the men to retreat to the house where the game is afoot.In the first act, it is Wyke who is control: he manipulates Milo with his absurd automata, demeaning him with a plot to solve his financial woes and finally destroying him in a puff of smoke and a bang. The audience is reeling.It is in the second act that we see the range of acting that made Lord Olivier a legend. Have you seen Wuthering Heights? The Prince and the Showgirl? Marathon Man?

Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine are both excellent in the roles of Andrew Wyke and Milo Tindle respectively and, in his final film, Joseph L.

It is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is. Some of the twists are good but one of them is so obvious from the word go that it is incredibly distracting.Considering that it stars Olivier (one of my absolute favourite actors) and was written by Shaffer (who also wrote \"The Wicker Man\", my 14th favourite film of all time), I was really looking forward to it but it did not even remotely live up to my expectations, I'm afraid. It is not very well structured and it is far too long at 2 hours and 18 minutes. The first half an hour is certainly the strongest. After that, it loses most of its momentum. The ending is great though. The supporting cast - Alec Cawthorne as Inspector Doppler, John Matthews as Detective Sgt. Tarrant, Eve Channing as Andrew's wife Marguerite Wyke and Teddy Martin as Police Constable Higgs - are all entirely forgettable. In mean, they might as well not have even been in the film.",

Needless to say (so why am I saying it then?), the limited setting would have never worked with less interesting actors; Caine may be a little dubious a choice for a half-Italian, but his charisma does help.

It's also full of clever twists that manage to completely change the direction of the film without breaking its flow, and never disregarding a believable logic. Yet, what truly sells this is the cast.Laurence Olivier (Andrew) and Michael Caine (Milo) are superb, both doing one of their best performances, and easily take charge of the movie.

That aside, this movie was quite enjoyable, even if it's plot twists are a bit easy to see coming.The story of a cuckolded husband, who is also an elite member of society and a game-crazed mystery writer, confronting the nouveau riche immigrant's son who is having an affair with his wife, \"Sleuth\" certainly has something to say on many levels.

In the director's chair is Joseph L. Mankiewicz, not a name often associated with thrillers, but a professional and adaptable craftsman nonetheless. One of Mankiewicz's prime focuses was on backgrounds, and with the limited scope of Sleuth he uses d\u00e9cor to broaden out the film experience. The various toys and automata of the house are shown in numerous timely inserts to the point at which they almost become characters in their own right, a kind of sly commentary on the antics of their living counterparts \u2013 Jolly Jack Tar in particular despite being a dummy always seems to have the right pose and expression for every occasion.Of course, this is largely the brainwork of the editor (Richard Marden) and Production design team (Ken Adam, Peter Lamont and John Jarvis). But Mankiewicz himself is responsible for selecting some canny angles and arrangements. The paraphernalia of the rooms is sometimes a subliminal reminder of some characteristic, for example the coats of arms on the window panes behind Michael Caine while Laurence Olivier puts him down over the latter's financial superiority. At other times it is a marker of atmosphere, the dead eyes or gaudy face of an automaton adding a touch of unease. Mankiewicz never normally moved the camera much unless to follow an actor, but here he breaks his own rule and gives the lens a life of its own, which not only draws attention to various props, but also gives the impression of a third entity on the set \u2013 a distraction in a wider drama but a boon in a confined and decidedly disturbing one such as this.A small cast can ill afford a weak link, but luckily the two leads here are monumental, arguably the two best British actors of their generations. Just like their characters, the two of them appear at first glance to be complete opposites in acting styles and traditions but really both achieve the same thing \u2013 a convincing mix of inhabited personae and dramatic intensity. Olivier seems to really relish taking on various comical and theatrical clich\u00e9s, while the \"real\" side to his character is incredibly subtle and nuanced, and so for me he is the better player by a tiny margin, but Caine's turn is certainly not to be sniffed at.So, on all accounts a perfectly made work as intricate and elaborate as one of Wyke's games. But perhaps this is its only problem \u2013 it is just too well-constructed as a thriller. When one thinks back over Shaffer's plot, too many of its twists play towards expertly misleading and surprising the audience, rather than being a logical sequence of events taken by real characters. As such, like many such suspense pictures it expends all its story value on a first viewing, and if worth repeated viewings it is only for the craftiness of the production and the majesty of the performances.",

So, that another \"game\" was afoot was clear -- the only question being \"exactly who WAS killed,\" because it clearly wasn't Milo.

The convoluted games that these two participate in would never be duplicated in reality. It was too big of a leap for me to make. I suppose the refined responses were part of the running theme of British civility, but I found myself unable to suspend my disbelief.I also thought the movie didn't stray enough from its roots as a play.

Laurence Olivier, as the very intelligent writer, seems to have the upperhand at first, but the trivial hairdresser (Caine) very soon shows to be a worthy opponent in this battle of games. The plot has no dull moment, with very many turns and twists, so the film keeps your full attention from beginning to end. And.. it's not just a play on film.

            "content": "SLEUTH is an adaptation of the stage play by the same name, written by Anthony Shaffer. It plays out as though it were a filmed play, mostly taking place not just at a single location, but mostly in one room at that.The plot is as follows - an eccentric millionaire invites his wife's lover to his house. The former proposes that the latter steal his wife's jewels from his safe and then claim the insurance. I won't give away any more of the plot, suffice to say that all is not what it seems and the two characters become engaged in a game of cat-and-mouse.Both Olivier and Caine invest a great deal of energy in their performances and no one could argue to the contrary. Olivier overacts at times, which I didn't expect. But both actors are enjoyable to watch in their roles... until all the endless talking without action becomes too boring that is.The problem with this film is that the plot simply doesn't deliver enough twists and turns. The plan to steal the jewels is talked about to an interminable degree. One would assume that Shaffer would have trimmed down the excessive dialogue for the big screen version. But he doesn't appear to have taken out even one line, judging by the film's length, which is simply too long for the story being told here.I really can't understand how this film can be held in such high regard. From reading some of the other reviews, I discovered that it was once listed in IMDb's top 250 films. There's no way that this film is one of the 250 best films of all time. I wouldn't even place it anywhere near the top 250 of my own personal list of films that I've seen. It's technically well-made and nice to see the performances of the two great actors but the film itself is boring and I was frequently looking at the elapsed time when watching it. I was hoping for a surprise denouement at the end of the film. But there wasn't one. The few twists and turns there are became easier to predict after the first one, which admittedly surprised me a little.Overall, SLEUTH is a disappointing thriller. It's labelled as a mystery but the only real mysteries are how this film attained such a high rating and why Shaffer thought it was a good idea to transfer his play to the big screen without making any apparent changes. Stage and film are two different mediums and Shaffer seems to forget this as he made this film.",

Caine, delightful as usual with light-fingered material, is able to keep up with his fellow player with minimalist playing. In fact, Caine is less believable when he emotes too much. As he does at the end of Act I.Act I is wonderful as the two thespian play like children through the author's Ken Adam designed house.Act II no doubt worked better on the stage as it requires a trick that's not so easily hidden in a movie. In fact, it's the weakest part of the movie.Still, the play's twists and turns are surprising to anyone unfamiliar with the story. And you won't get any enlightenment from me.Olivier is best known for his stage work and early in his career, like other famous stage actors, he disdained film work. His performance is good but at times in Act I he seems more like Peter Sellers' Quilty.The whole thing is more than faintly ridiculous. Frankly, I like ridiculous. And I like to see a good \"ping pong\" match between good actors of the English persuasion. But this goes on far too long.Ultimately, the best part of \"Sleuth,\" especially on repeated viewings, is Ken Adams' craftily-designed playhouse.Too, the author, a very famous playwright, is too much in love with his own words.

But when the only actors are Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine who else do you need ?In most of his films Caine plays a similar character to this one,sauve and cool but still with a rough edge to him. No matter how similar his performances are they're usually very good and the one in this film is no exception. But the real scene stealer in the picture is Larry Olivier.\nThe role in the film is a little closer to his real life self (an older,dignified Englishman as opposed to a Roman general or Nazi doctor) but he still creates a unique character that takes a life of it's own. Olivier is adept at what he does that even if you try to just observe his talent you are unconsciously pulled into seeing the character he plays. His performance is very nuanced though he sometimes relies on exaggerated body gestures perhaps due to his old,stage background but he doesn't need them the way some hams do;he simply utilizes them at certain times. I'd also like to take a minute to mention his ability to change his voice. Constantly in the film he alternates his voice drastically and if you didn't see him you'd never guess who it was(for instance he provided the laugh for Jack) voice was something he found to be essential to a role and something he honed throughout his career. Not to put him down in any way,but take a look at Michael Caine as Doppler-which justs sounds like Michael Caine trying to talk in a gruff voice. Both give terrific performances and were nominated for the Best Actor Oscar however Brando gave a performance the Acedmy couldn't refuse...but he could.The film was the last Joseph Mankewicz directed and a good note to end on. Besides the plot,actors and score there's a little something extra to the films tone,such as the perpetual shots of the dolls. Mankewicz generates the perfect feel and tension for the picture and was deservedly nominated for a Best Director Academy Award.Sleuth is one of the craftiest films ever,continually coming up with a suprising(or not) twist that will keep you on your feet. You might wonder how much can happen between just two men in a house for 138mins but things get tangled in a duel of wits..\nwith deadly results.",

            "content": "(spoilers herein)Sirs Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier make great foils in this most entertaining movie.  Olivier is in his self-effacing, natural-acting mode in this one, thank heaven, and Caine gets to use his superior skills in moments of both daffy comedy and high drama.Sleuth is intricately plotted, yes, but not confusingly, so, and is therefore a joy to follow.  It is a constant case of cat-and-mouse, who-done-what and why/how and one-upmanship that never gets boring, even after many viewings.  Each time I see the film, there is something `new' to enjoy about it \u0096 something I didn't notice or fully appreciate before.CORKING DIALOG!  The Brits prove that they do it best.  Here are just a few choice adjectives to describe the dialog and script (which is, in turn): clever, mature, offensive, hilarious, scintillating, pejorative, lyrical, depressing, surprising and original.  It is not \u0096 even once \u0096 common.  All this, and it includes lines from the great Cole Porter song `Anything Goes!'ACTORS BEST SCENES: Laurence Olivier (mystery writer Andrew Wyke) \u0096 has a very funny speech about killing Caine (Wyke's wife's lover) with the `traditional blunt instrument \u0096 the mashie niblick,' which must be heard and seen to be believed.  At the end of his fantastic, fiendish fantasy, he tosses the golf club aside, claiming that the whole thing is `too bloody elaborate,' and that he must think of another way to do it.  Also, the line about hiding the knife behind the bell pull like they do in all the old movies is great. This is his best scene in the film, in my estimation.  A true laugh-out-loud moment!Michael Caine (Milo Tindle) \u0096 his best scene is very different in tone  -- one of drama and terror, as his life is threatened by Olivier, whom he calls a maniac and a `bloody madman.'  He is forced to beg and plead for his life to be spared, and the audience can strongly identify with his predicament. Here Caine never lets his vanity overcome his craft for a second.  I know of few actors that would have agreed to play the scene in this startlingly realistic way, and there are few who could have pulled off this difficult scenario with the same aplomb.  Simply magnificent.A minor plot quibble:  Why Wyke is taken in so easily by Inspector Doppler I will never know.  This aspect of the film rings false, and compromises the character's believability as a supposed mystery writer.Other than that, the plot is great and makes excellent use of the house, its surroundings and furnishings.  Very clever is the use of the various gadgets (puzzle jar, turnstiles to the bedrooms, wheel of fortune) and the many toys and games scattered throughout the house.The ending with Olivier finding the clues is quite suspenseful.  I always end up sitting on the edge of my seat \u0096 and new viewers will most likely be surprised by the denouement.Performing the play version must have been exhausting for the actors, as the pace and action are both so quick.Interestingly enough, the wacky cast credits do NOT include the house itself, which I think is an oversight, seeing as how it played such an integral part in the film.  Go figure.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",

            "content": "I use the term \"baffling\" not to describe a sense of confusion with the would-be labyrinthine plot, but bafflement at what the film was actually trying to achieve.Elsewhere it's described as a picture for \"thinking people\", as if this is some cerebral showcase that only a niche audience would be able to comprehend. Yet it contains \"twists\" so heavily signposted and telegraphed that the (mis)assumption is that the characters are aware of this, and are playing some elaborate game with assumed identities, where pretending to be fooled is part of the set up.The first twist with Caine's \"death\" is fine, a nice mix of straight intrigue and perverse theatricality... the unhinged, left-field acting choices of Caine, and, particularly, Olivier, something of a delight. But then it begins to all get a little strange. Caine comes back, disguised as a policeman, and Oliver is terrified of the prospect.Now, Michael Caine is a fine actor, but a chameleon he is not - most notably in, say, 1997's Mandela and De Klerk - so only the truly incredulous would see the bald cap and cod accent of \"Inspector Doppler\" and NOT immediately realise it's Michael Caine dressed up. Yet somehow Oliver goes along with this transparent, obvious charade - and a later one where Caine \"talks to two policemen at the door\" - to the extent that the camp shenanigans seem like a game both men are playing. And not a \"game\" as in the game of masculine pride that is really going on, but some kind of game where two lovers are assuming roles, and going along with each others' incredibly transparent \"tricks\" in order to continue the fun.When you realise that not only are they supposed to be genuinely fooled, but that also people see this bit of frivolous nonsense as an intellectual exercise, you realise that this is an \"intelligent\" film for people who don't actually know what an intelligent film actually is.It's not, I would argue, one for a \"thinking person\", it's one where you have to switch your mind off, and just go along with an incredibly unlikely journey of two fine actors elevating shaky material. It's good stuff, as indicated by my (slightly too generous) rating, but ultimately hollow.One last point of trivia, which had no bearing on my overall mark, but does bear mentioning - there are a great number of continuity clashes and errors in the film, with various hand placements/objects differing from shot to shot. Many of them have already been captured in the IMDb's \"goofs\" section, though I was planning to add more, before I realised what an exhausting prospect this would be, as there are so many. However, of special note is Caine - as Inspector Doppler, his back to the camera, with his hand raised with a pen in it to take notes - talking to Oliver on the stairs. It cuts to a shot with the side view of Caine, where his arms are at his side, and then raise to begin to take said notes... just one of many clashes of continuity that pepper an enticing, yet slight, two-hander. Or, as you may have it, a movie for \"thinking people\"... like many of the \"twists\" in the film, it's all a matter of perception.",

He finds out about the affair and from that point we have a film full of twists & clever little turns.Neither actor is particularly stretched by their respective characters, but they are both seem to revel in them, especially Olivier, who seems to enjoy this stage adaption to the full.The very ending is possibly a little cliched & melodramatic. BUT, don't let this put you off. Its a very clever piece of character engineering, with few distractions, only pure acting & admiration for the lead roles.Encore!****/*****",

            "content": "I've just read through all the comments about this movie then before I attempted to write about something relating to the movie myself I did a google search for \"Sleuth Sondheim\". The reason I included Sondheim in the search is because of something I learned back in 1985 about the Tony Award Winning Play version. I'm not any kind of a writer so please bare with me. I'm an actor. I was in a production of SLEUTH. I originally was cast as \"Andrew Wyke\" and also understudied the role of \"Milo Tindle\". A couple of weeks into rehearsal the actor playing Milo had to leave the production. The director made a decision to have MY understudy play Andrew and I would switch to playing Milo. This happened right after I learned all of Andrew's lines. So, as a result I knew the entire play. I in fact could rehearse the whole show myself. Anyway, it turned out to be a great production. Now we go to 1984. I'm appearing in my Broadway debut of Stephen Sondheim's \"Sunday In The Park With George\" with Bernadette Peters and Mandy Patinkin. The show ran for about a year and a half. I can't remember exactly when but Mr. Sondheim had a party at his home and the cast was invited. When I stepped inside his home and after being given a tour of the place. I was in awe. I approached Stephen and shyly told him about the play Sleuth that I had done years ago. I told him how his entire home reminded me of the set. Complete with gallery of antique games and the like. He said, \"So, it's all kind of falling into place then, eh?\" As it turns out he tells me that the playwright Anthony Shaffer is a friend of his and had spent a weekend with him playing murder games. That's where he got the idea for the original play and in fact based the games-playing aspect of the character of \"Andrew Wyke\" on Stephen Sondheim. Evidently, the character so evoked Sondheim that the play's producer, Morton Gottlieb, suggested calling the thriller Who's Afraid of Stephen Sondheim? Years later when the DVD came out it has a fantastic interview with the author and he tells about it. Along with stories of Sondheim's first meeting Lord Laurence Olivier that are quite amusing.What I can say first hand is the film follows very closely to the stage script. Wonderfully witty writing. One of my favorite lines has to be \"...You never know. A dallying couple, a passing sheep-rapist.\" The sort of witty dialogue most performers dream about. I did however, read somewhere the Olivier had a problem with learning the lines and that the set was closed because of it.\"Shaffer was also reluctant to sell the film rights to the play, fearing it would undercut its success of the stage. When he finally did relent,he hoped the film version would retain the services of Anthony Quayle, who essayed the role of Wyke in London. Alan Bates was Shaffer's pick for the part of Milo Tindle. In the end, director Mankiewicz opted for Olivier and Caine, though the former had once denounced the play as a \"piece of p_ss.\"",

            "content": "Laurence Olivier is cast as a filthy rich man whose passions are games and mysteries. Into his lavish mansion wanders lowly actor Michael Caine, who is having an affair with Olivier's ostensibly neglected wife and wants Olivier to divorce her and clear his way. Olivier is indifferent to the infidelity, but indulges Caine in a potentially deadly game of one-upmanship.Although this film has largely been forgotten in the sands of time, it was highly regarded at the time and there are people who still act as though it is a worthwhile endeavor. For me, it misses the mark by a wide mile. It is a stage to screen adaptation and it feels exactly like a badly filmed stage play. There has been no attempt to open it up for cinema or make it cinematic in any meaningful way.Despite the attempts at hoodwinking the audience by including a fictitious supporting cast in the opening credits, this is solely a two-man show. Both Olivier and Caine are in scenery chomping mode, so with no other distractions there is literally no break from them. Neither of these men become the characters they are supposed to be or disappear effectively into their roles. Instead, we are not allowed to forget for one instant that these are GREAT ACTORS ACTING!!! There were times when I felt I was trapped in an acting class where a couple of the teachers decided to show us how it was done before turning to the audience and saying \"Now you try it\". The performances end up being loud, hammy or unconvincing, and seem to be presented only to wow us with their \"technique\". Olivier fares slightly better as there are times when it becomes apparent that Caine is miscast. Olivier gets an almost laughable rant berating Caine at one point. Laughable less because of Olivier's over-the-top delivery, but because when he accuses Caine of turning his wife's head with his hunky young body, deeply tanned skin and amazing good looks, we have literally no idea who the heck Olivier is referring to. Caine in this film is pale as the winter snow, droopy faced, slight, and scrawny to the point of emaciation. He resembles nothing of the description that Olivier insists upon. Olivier seems to be describing Charles Atlas and we are looking at Marty Milquetoast.The direction is fairly unimpressive. Worse, the film seems to be deluding itself that it is much cleverer and more fun than it is. It operates like it honestly believes that its twists and turns are so surprising and astounding that viewers will be enrapt. Unfortunately, the film fails to surprise at any point. At the mid-way point, the film blacks out with Olivier threatening a begging Caine with death. Ostensibly this is to leave us with the notion that Olivier has potentially offed Caine. However, in the very next scene, Olivier is visited by an inquisitive detective purportedly investigating the missing actor. It is obvious from the moment that the \"detective\" arrives that it is Caine dressed in unconvincing padding and mustache. The detective looks like Caine, acts like Caine and sounds like Caine. The fact that Olivier cannot immediately see through the obvious deception makes his character now seem like a moron. Actors convincingly hoodwinking the audience in dual roles are indeed possible (see Witness for the Prosecution for one example). The problem is that is does not happen at all here, which makes the unfolding plot impossible to take at face value. Even withdrawing oneself a bit to try to appreciate the mechanics of the plot do not work as the twists and turns are compromised by the weaknesses and end up never being as compelling or surprising as anyone wants to pretend they are.If you are angling to see British acting greats Olivier and Caine in a film, then this is the opportunity for you. Anyone else looking for a clever mystery, intriguing characters or thrills, are encouraged to seek their pleasures elsewhere.",

I assume anyone who was taken in by it must be a moron, but here it is. After Michael Caine appears to have been murdered by Olivier, a \"police inspector\" shows up to investigate, and he is obviously Michael Caine. He acts like Caine, he walks like Caine, he talks like Caine -- he is Caine. It is absolutely unbelievable to me that the Olivier character would not have recognized the \"inspector\" instantly as Caine (and, of course, that goes for the audience as well). To me, this rendered the entire movie stupid and absurd. But most of the movie was stupid. Olivier may have been a \"great actor,\" but he way over-acted in this one, to the point that I just wanted to shout at him to shut up. Caine, as well, did quite a lot of hamming it up. All told, I hated this movie, and the only reason I gave it two stars was because I reserve one star for movies I couldn't watch to the end. P.S., other reviewers mentioned \"Deathtrap,\" and I'd just like to add that, as annoying as \"Deathtrap\" was in places, it was at least interesting and entertaining with unexpected twists. I saw \"Deathtrap\" on stage in New York City and thought it was better than the movie, but the movie was infinitely better than \"Sleuth.\"",

With the exception of The Wicker Man, I don't see much to warrant his esteem, especially not the repulsive Frenzy. Sleuth however does have much to be admired, but all the same it's an oddity: a miserable comedy... a guessing game that's very predictable.... an actor's showcase which is strangely miscast...Stage plays being turned into films is rarely a good idea, and in Sleutch's case, it was specifically a play that was about theatre, about illusion, about charade and performance, and crucially it was designed as a theatrical sleight-of-hand, it's great coup de theatre being something that can only work on stage, and only then if done by precisely the right actor.Thanks to it' tasty script full of colourful dialogue, accents, lampooning and bitchiness, its always a joy to watch, but there are some very odd wrong notes in the movie that one has to wonder about. Olivier is absolutely bang on as Wyke, a man you'd hate to be friends with but can't get enough of on screen. But Caine, despite giving his best shot at Milo, is all at sea. He is not the bronzed Lothario nouveau rich playboy who threatens Wyke's Olde England. And he fails completely to fool us with his Inspector Doppler. How would Wyke, who is such a master of games playing, be so fooled? Caine never gives a bad performance, but Milo is a part for a character actor: Finney or Bates would indeed have been perfect. His accent and manor are not easily camouflaged. He's not a chameleon actor.Also there are some very odd cuts in the film. What's with the red jacket Milo moves near the end? There are some very odd cutaways to inanimate objects that don't really do anything for the movie. And the house itself isn't quite the puzzle palace it out to be. The film just doesn';t quite capture the \"fun\" of it all.The relationship between the two men is also a bit inconsistent. After Doppler is disposed of, Milo is getting changed, chatting away, having a drink. Five minutes later is is seething about Wyke's earlier treatment of him.It also has one twist too many at the end, and stops being believable. And lets fact it, the burglary plot and clown's disguise....huh? That's all the moaning about it over, but it's still riveting entertainment!",

However, it seems that the original had a high rating and so it incited me to watch the original 1972 Sleuth. The plot of remake generally retains the original storyline and changes casting, historical background and dialog. Those who have already seen the original would hope there to be nothing except for better dialog than in the original, but when I watched the original film I found it was not as exciting as I had expected. This may be a similar feeling to one when people watch the remake after they have watched the original. Because the plot device is essential to this film and so it seems like the audiences is watching the same performance twice if they know the storyline.In the remake, Jude Law plays as Milo and Michael Caine plays Wyck, and In the original, Michael Caine takes a role as Wyck and Lawrence Oliver acts the role of Milo. Milo was a hairdresser in the original whilst he is an actor in the remake. What is interesting in the 72' original is that several dolls in Wyck's house are watching the interaction between the two British gentlemen as if the dolls watch their mind games in a sneering manner from beginning to end. The witty jokes between the two are also interesting.I would personally like the remake in that the 2007 version has more stylish in the setting and the storyline of a 86 minutes cut waste to the minimum. However, I have to admit that the ending of the third round cannot transcend the original. I would recommend watching the remake from 2007 for those who have not watched both of them. It is also good to try out the remake for those who have watched the original. You may find it funny that in the remake Jude Law says things like \"I am not a hairdresser\" several times in the film.",

Not much can be said about the story without giving away some of those twists.

While \"Sleuth\" is not an \"intellectual\" film, it actually does make you think about some serious issues of class and of what concepts like gamesmanship, honor, and payback mean to people of different social status.",

I think it does.Finally if Caines character is not dead, who is and who did it. this is why I think the film is brilliant it is a true whodunit and you are left to solve the crime after the movie is over, it stays on your mind for quite some time.",

A wickedly fun and devilish two-hander that's as sharp and stylish as it is overlong and tiring, resting on the shoulders of two very capable Oscar-nominated leads embroiled in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse. Sparing no corner of the lavish manor set as they swallow entire sequences whole, Sir Laurence Olivier and his young (!) dance partner delight in outwitting each other with acting acrobatics and highly intellectual jabs that are sure to leave a lasting impression on viewers, even if their mileage may vary as the picture runs short on steam heading into its third act. One would be remiss to forget the debuting efforts of Alec Cawthorne and John Matthews, their names appearing in the opening credits as another sly wink to the audience from American director and screen legend Joseph L.

His words are 'executed'. Every shoulder twist, every smirk, every wince: a perfect exercise in fluidity and precision. If any young actor wishes to see an example of \"how it should be done\", then \"Sleuth\" should be required viewing.Then there is Michael Caine: probably the only British actor capable of successfully defending Wyeck's (Olivier's) contemptuous opinion of anyone who is \"Not like ME\", (Is this so far apart from the way many feel today?

When Milo comes back as Doppler, it is obvious within seconds of him entering the house that he is Milo. We all know it as viewers and it is very na\u00efve to assume that Andrew as an experienced games player and prankster would not see through his disguise within seconds. Even if his disguise was even better, the voice is a dead give away.Many people have said that another actor should have played Doppler and then the big reveal would have been such a surprise. The problem I have is that Milo had to have a disguise that could realistically be done by one of his make up artist friends. I have to be fair to the writer and director here and just be prepared to let this flaw be overlooked. It's a no win situation for the viewer.In all other respects, it's a great piece of entertainment that has two fine actors fighting for top billing.",

There is such an edgy tension to it that never relents. I first came across Sleuth on television while channel surfing, and although I missed the first 20 minutes, I was still captured instantly. Later, I made a trip to the local video store, viewed the minutes I had missed, and then bought my own copy. It pushed all my buttons. I have a background in law enforcement, and I love a good mystery. To quote the song: \"it's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory...jealousy and hate.\" How could you not be fascinated? Sleuth has everything: drama, humor, surprise, witty dialog, great music (I hum the theme song a LOT!). I purchased a copy of the screenplay, and have huge chunks of it memorized. As the plot unfolds, the roller-coaster-tension accelerates, and just when you think you have it figured out, a new twist ratchets the tension up from 'danger' to 'forget-to-breathe-scary', then lulls you with periods of calm and humor before returning instantly, without warning to the previous level of panic. Like watching a train wreck, you cannot take your eyes off of the two protagonists: Olivier is considered by many the greatest actor of the 20th century. Michael Caine is also a great actor, and, although he told reporters later that he was intimidated by Olivier, he goes toe to toe with the veteran Shakespearean actor in every scene. From the trailer and the reviews I have read the Kenneth Branagh remake due out this year has been so modernized as to be unrecognizable. See the original.

The pendulum of power swings between the characters so frequently with mild mannered Milo swept up in the moment as his host Wyke seemingly enjoys the farce he has single handedly created. The plot is so filled with twists and turns you'll not be able to leave the room for one minute. It's consuming, it's addictive and it's wonderfully melodramatic!The Lord Olivier is absolutely flawless in his portrayal of Wyke; you sense his excitement and devilment. You feel the personal power he regains at select points throughout the film with a few chosen words. The performance here of wealth and status (make no mistake, it's not idlery, because he's a self-made man who works very hard), but certainly snobbery and pompousness is just sublime. He enjoys the fine things in life and his obsessiveness and his house is the strangest cross between a museum and a sumptuous residence. It's clean, ordered and luxurious, but it's cold; there's no soul left and all the parties have ended - and crucially, in his icy heart Wyke knows it.Michael Caine is completely believable in his role too...for a while. Tindle is descended from hard working Italian stock and wants for more Englishness and leisure...But as good as Caine is (and he is good) he is sadly, completely outclassed here by Olivier for most, if not all of the film.Which of the characters retains their dignity to the end and deserves to be hailed a gentleman remains to be seen...
