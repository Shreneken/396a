            "content": "A timeless classic! The musical numbers alone are superlative, even the 30-years-younger CHICAGO (2002, 8/10) pales in comparison. My very first Bob Fosse's film, certainly the film gained its classic fame as the biggest winner of the Oscar in 1973, with 8 wins (including BEST DIRECTOR, LEADING ACTRESS and SUPPORTING ACTOR) and nearly usurped the BEST PICTURE trophy from THE GODFATHER (1972, 9/10), if it had been so, it would be inflicted with much notorious backfire in the film history, but the film itself is an unerring gem among the undying musical genre, my first viewing is a thoroughly exultant experience, and cut and dried, it's on my guilty-pleasure list. It is my first Liza Minnelli's film as well, the cabaret's \"international sensation\" Sally Bowles, an innocuous vamp, Liza grants her role a disarming vitality and quaintly resembles a bobbed Anne Hathaway doppelg\u00e4nger, not only radiates her grandeur in rendering her doughty-yet-alluring show tunes (she is born to do it), her portrayal of Sally personal life is equally (if not more) affecting, her doe-eyed naivety and unrestrained zest for life, for love, for fame elevate her character as the master of her own fate, her sacrifice may not gain concurrence from motley views of life, but a full obeisance to her independence and pluck is duly earned. Michael York, behind his gawky effeminacy, plunges himself into a more contentious venture, Brian Roberts, his character's bookish bi-sexual temperament is a provocative taboo on big screen (like since ever) and the implicit m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois temptation (with Sally and the suave Helmut Griem, whose gentrified debonair is utterly irresistible) has been simmering to the perfect temperature, under-girds a manifestation of initiating a sex-liberation wave (germane to the 70s era while against the Nazi-rising milieu in the film). There is a subplot dealing with a bromide of a down-and-out German guy's infatuation with a rich but prude Jewish girl, there is an ironic twist near the end, however never quite manages to steal the limelight from Sally and Bri, but Marisa Berenson's placid performance is still worthy of backslapping (the dichotomy of women's images is a trifle stale though). Joel Grey, as the so called \"Master of Ceremonies\" and won an Oscar (against three fellows from THE GODFATHER), serves only as the performer in the film, no clear attachment with the plot, his musical set pieces are burlesque, risqu\u00e9 but entertaining to the bone, with a strenuous mimicry of German accent, it is a hard-earned honor, although I don't understand how Al Pacino could lose at any rate. The film drops its curtain right before the prevalence of Nazi's atrocity, the ending with the vague reflections of Third Reich audience occupying the place has sublimated the materialistic razzle-dazzle onto an eerily ominous scope which the film has no interest to tamper but the audiences will intuit what will happen next. A great windup, neat and potent!",

            "content": "Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome! Fremde, etranger, stranger. This movie is phenomenal, one of the best of all time musicals ever. Directed by Bob Fosse, what a marvelous performances by Joel Grey and Liza Minnelli in this picture. Cabaret is a lot of fun to watch. The film is loosely based off the 1939's book written by Christopher Isherwood call 'Berlin Stories: Goodbye to Berlin\" and John Van Druten's 1951's play, 'I am a Camera'. Cabaret was made into a Broadway musical in 1966 with music by John Kander, and lyrics by Fred Ebb. When it became a hit, a movie was produce in 1972, to capitalize on this fame. The film is set in Berlin during the Weimar Republic in 1931, under the ominous presence of the growing Nazi Party where a small night club call Kit Kat Klub is struggling to survive during the coming months of the harsh new regime. Since the musical kept on rewriting the script, as years passed by. A lot of the source material has change over time. In this version, young American Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) performs at the Kit Kat Klub, while running a boarding house. A new English teacher arrival in the city, Brian Roberts (Michael York), and moves in with her. At first, they kept each other at reservations, trying not to fall in love with each other. As time go on, the two find themselves madly in love with each other, while the world is finding new ways to keep them apart. The acting is pretty good. I really can't picture anybody else in the role of Sally Bowles. Indeed, Liza singing is way too talent than her character is supposed to be, but it didn't really hurt the film. Sally Bowles was based on Jean Ross, an aspiring actress, singer and writer, who lived a colorful life. Jean Ross was offended by the character portrayal by Liza, call it apolitical. After all, Jean Ross is kinda right. Sally Bowles might not be the most likable character as she does a lot of pretty awful stuff, but the way, Liza Minnelli sink you in, with her charm. You can't help, feeling for her. She always had that frantic, nervous, almost desperate disposition in everything Liza's in. It really does explain why she didn't had much of a film career after this. Normally I find this off-putting, but here, it works perfectly in this role. Sally always looks and sounds like she's in deep, desperate denial about her life and the state of Berlin, and constantly seems on the edge of a nervous breakdown. I really fell pity for Michael York's character to having to deal with her. I never understood why, they change the character name from Cliff Bradshaw to Brian Roberts. It seem a bit odd. I found York acting alright, but he never stood out, much. I did find his big reveal to Sally about what happen to Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem), midway through the movie to be a great twist. That wasn't in the stage versions. The movie also dealt with sub-plots, dealing with other characters like Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper), a German Jew passing as a Christian who fall in love with Natalia Landauer (Marisa Berenson), a wealthy German Jewish heiress. This part of the film, always felt like a different movie. It never mixed, well. The sub-plot from the novel, involves the doomed romance between German boarding house owner Fr\u00e4ulein Schneider and her elderly suitor, Herr Schultz, a Jewish fruit vendor never got anywhere, as it was cut from the film. I also glad, they cut the dead dog scene. That was pretty awful. In the traditional manner of musical theater, every significant character in the stage version of Cabaret sings to express emotion and advance the plot, foreshadowing every song with Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey). Fosse cut a lot of songs like 'Don't tell momma', 'So What?\", \"Telephone Song\", \"Perfectly Marvelous\", \"Why Should I Wake Up?\", \"The Money Song\", \"It Couldn't Please Me More\", \"Meeskite\" and \"What Would You Do?\" He replace them with new songs like 'Mein Herr' and 'Money, Money\". There were a lot better than those other songs. The song 'Willkommen' and 'Cabaret' were after all the best pieces in the musical. The club serves as a metaphor for the threatening state of late Weimar Germany that is clear. While this might be long stretch, the film could also be a metaphor of American Ku Klux Klan movement that was gaining ground in the 1960s. After all, the club had the same initials of the Klan. Indeed, the KKK didn't embrace Nazism, because they believes in an entirely different form of government and freedoms. But like the film, the culture of the KKK embracing Nazism into their lives. It might be something to think about. Honestly, the only song that wasn't play at the club was 'Tomorrow belongs to me' in the beer garden by the German youth was powerful. What a really great haunting song by two great Jewish songwriters. Great use of the elderly man in the background of that scene. Director Bob Fosse knew how to film this movie, and that's one of his greatest shots in the film. For a movie rated PG. It's has strong adult themes. The ending to the film is hard to swallow. Unlike other musicals at the time, this one doesn't end with a positive note. Still, the movie was indeed a success, and won many Academy Awards with 8. It would had won Best Picture in that year if the Godfather film wasn't so damn awesome. The movie is easy to find, despite not being available in high-def or digital presentation, due to a really bad scratch on the original film. Overall: it's was a great commentary on the \"mask of normalcy\" people are wearing during the rise of Fascism in Germany. A must watch for any musical lover.",

            "review_title": "Divine decadence",
            "content": "Director Bob Fosse hasn't achieved an immense degree of recognition, but his movies have a distinctive flavour. He seems to have an obsession with the world of music-hall, which is felt in other movies like \"Sweet Charity\" and \"All that Jazz\". In his other movies though, musical performances tend to steal the show almost entirely. \"Cabaret\" is an exception because it has an interesting background and storyline, and the music-hall performances are cleverly used here to illustrate and emphasize the plot. They play about the same role as the Chorus in ancient Greek play.Of course, the depiction of Cabaret's \"Kit Kat Club\" deserves attention all by itself. It is not surprising that a cabaret buff such as Bob Fosse took interest in the Weimar Republic period in Germany, when \"divine decadence \" was the name of the game. Only Bob Fosse could recreate with such consumed application the grotesque sleaze of Berlin's lowlife during the rise of Nazism, a context which served as inspiration for expressionist painters, and for Brecht's \"Threepenny Opera\". During the credits, check out a woman in the public with short hair and glasses smoking a cigarette (something quite dodgy in 1931!). It is the exact reproduction of a famous painting by Otto Dix.An outrageously grinning clown (Joel Grey) introduces every cabaret number. The girls appear in all possible contorted postures keeping deadpan faces. The Kit Kat club reminds of a roman arena, where the public is out for anything insane (even women fights in the mud...). To give an idea of what sort of den the club is, Michael York finds himself at one point standing next to a transvestite in a men's urinal...The cabaret performances get all the more provocative as the plot gets tense. The club is an essentially immoral place where anything is for sale, and it adapts shamelessly to the radical political changes coming up.Liza Minelli's character is totally at home in such surroundings. Her persona is perfectly sketched in her song \"Bye Bye Mein Herr\". She is the incarnation of the vamp, both heartless and ingenuous, the sort of lethal woman who drives men crazy and then gives them up like toys. Indeed, a very typical stereotype of the interwar period, think of Marlene Dietrich in \"the Blue Angel\"...Minelli's performance onstage with garter belts and a bowler hat still looks elegantly naughty today.Though, the real nature of her character is well studied as soon as she gets offstage. While Minelli can't help being extravagant all the time, she turns out to be a fragile woman neglected by her father, and in demand of constant and renewed attention. As predicted in her song, she proves basically unable to engage in any serious relationship, despite her involvement with Michael York ( \"And though I used to care, I need the open air, you'd every cause to doubt me Mein Herr\").The script was based a story by British writer Christopher Isherwood, called \"A Goodbye to Berlin\", based on his own personal memories. He is allegedly the character played by Michael York. A serious upper class young man, he meets Liza Minelli out of blind chance, while looking for an apartment to share. She introduces him to all sorts of people, from riff-raff to aristocracy, including a gigolo, a Jewish heiress, and an ambiguous baron who dismisses them both after having \"played\" with the two of them. Michael York's sober performance looks a bit pale as opposed to histrionic Liza Minelli, but of course, that was necessary in order to stress the essential difference between those two strangers. The movie ends as they part on a railway platform, but one can guess their experience together will have changed them both, as as far as he is concerned, was a definite coming of age.One of the scenes, in the middle of the movie, is quite disturbing. At a countryside inn, a young S.A man sings a song called \"Tomorrow belongs to me\", which starts out nostalgic but gradually turns into an infectious Nazi march as the whole crowd joins him. This unexpected number seems to have embarrassed many viewers. If Nazism had presented itself as pure evil, would it have met any success? This daring scene makes evident that it was for many Germans of the time the symbol of positive values : beauty, tradition, order, pride, future. If you didn't know how things turned out, would you not have been tempted to sing along this powerful hymn to the fatherland as you watch this? Good question to ask oneself even, or especially, nowadays...",

            "review_title": "Brilliantly successful combination of musical with dark drama",
            "content": "The scene is Berlin just before the completion of Adolf Hitler's rise to power. Two apolitical people go about their lives while impending doom surrounds them. Cabaret is a ground-breaking combination of social drama and musical entertainment. It's one of the best examples of films from the New Hollywood. This was a short time in American cinema where the studios were producing challenging and director-led personal films.What Cabaret does which is so unique is to reinvent what the musical could be. It's a film that is essentially a drama that uses musical numbers to comment on its story. The songs all fit into a realistic narrative. Most of them are sung within the confines of the Kit Kat Klub, the cabaret of the title. In taking this approach the movie is more able to incorporate a disturbing subject such as the Germany's progression to Nazism into this most fantastical and joyous of film genres. All of the songs comment on the social situation in Germany at the time and because they are all performed in the cabaret they can be explained in a real context, cleverly allowing those who do not even like musicals to enjoy them as they do not break the illusion of reality. The one song that is performed outside the club is perhaps the most memorable however. 'Tomorrow Belongs to Me' is sung by a young fresh-faced boy with an angelic voice. It starts out quite beautifully but as it progresses the camera pans down and we see the emblem of the swastika on a band around his arm and realise he is a Hitler Youth. The words suddenly take on an altogether more sinister meaning. It's a moment that really encapsulates the way that fascism seemed like a progressive way ahead for the majority of people at the time. With the benefit of hindsight we, of course, see the horror of what it represents but for many Germans at the time, the ideals of Hitlerism had an attraction, and 'Tomorrow Belongs to Me' brilliantly illustrates both these points.Another way in which the film differentiates itself from most others that deal with this time and place is that there is barely a mention of the Nazis at all. All the Nazis characters exist in the periphery of the story, they barely interact with the characters in any way. Their significance is in no need of emphasis; their presence is ominously felt throughout. Cabaret reflects the changes in Germany from the point of view of people living in their own little world but the true horror is never far from the surface. The strange insular world of the Kit Kat Klub encapsulates this perfectly. Hosted by the enigmatic, almost supernatural, Master of Ceremonies, it's a decadent place that exists apart from the realities of Hitlerism, a place that we all know must be ultimately doomed when the Nazis fully rise to power.Performances are universally great with Michael York and Liza Minnelli both putting in very fine work. Minnelli especially has to be credited for combining both dramatic acting and musical performances of both the highest calibre. The songs themselves are memorable and work in the clever double way of providing entertainment while commenting on dark issues below the surface. In a sense, that is the genius of Cabaret overall.",

            "review_title": "An eerie, glowing tinderbox full of grinning souls and desperate laughter...",
            "content": "Pre-Nazi Germany is a hotbed of escalating tensions, but decadent nightclub performer Sally Bowles is oblivious to the encroaching horrors. If you know a little about Liza Minnelli and you're curious, \"Cabaret\" should make you a fan; if you're not interested or just don't like her, \"Cabaret\" probably isn't the movie for you. Liza is the heart, soul, and centerpiece of the picture; when she's on-screen, everybody else is irrelevant. Movie-fans still discuss whether Liza was actually acting the role of Sally Bowles or just being herself (her Oscar-win still draws debates--Diana Ross in \"Lady Sings The Blues\" is oft-times described as 'robbed' for the Best Actress statue). Indeed, time has proved that Minnelli had a whole lot in common with Sally, the parallels are even echoed in much of the dialogue, but this part utilizes her entire range (sarcastic sass, vulnerable imp, high-powered musical presence) and she's fabulous. She doesn't do anything small, even her quiet moments are extraordinary. Her final speech to Michael York (\"How soon would it be before we started hating each other?\") is a knockout, as good as any of her musical numbers, and when he lashes out in anger, she sighs, \"If you wanna hit me, why don't'cha just hit me?\" She can be fragile and wounded, but it's in her spirit to get right back up and perform. The film is a burlesque nightmare, amazingly directed by Oscar winner Bob Fosse, who also choreographed the musical numbers, and photographed by Geoffrey Unsworth, another Oscar recipient. ***1/2 from ****",

None of the sweetness of Rodgers and Hammerstein, none of the joyous celebration of life of 'The Sound of Music.''Cabaret' is an exciting place for music...'Cabaret' is the first musical to exploit the notion that life is fascinating because it is ambiguous... 'Cabaret' uses music in an exciting new way... His characters do not disintegrate into song to express their emotions... Rather, a sleazy night club becomes a place where satirical comment on the lives and problems of these characters is made in striking, entertaining, and often in ferocious dances and songs...'Cabaret' is only one of three major elements that remains separate in the film and then gradually and inexorably become melted into one... These elements are the music of the cabaret, the lives of the principal characters, and the world outside of their narrow domain... Director Bob Fosse captures the atmosphere and turmoil of the time and place, just before Hitler's rise to power, presenting a multifaceted portrait of a hedonistic, increasingly dangerous society, in which every brushstroke is significant and influential...The cast, headed by Liza Minnelli as an American cabaret star and Michael York as the shy Englishman suffering with the fact that he \"doesn't like girls,\" perfectly embodied the characters caught up in the currents of the tale...The film begins with an amorphous view of Berlin's Kit Kat Club in 1930s Germany, and as the view becomes clearer, we meet the nightclub's depraved customers and its host, the charming painted emcee, who sings 'Willkommen' as the cabaret's girls play their musical instruments... At this moment, the Kit Kat Club shows a world unconcerned with events... Sally is a citizen of this world, deliberately shocking, cheerfully promiscuous, a lost child masquerading as a seductive woman...Away from the nightclub, Sally plays the leading role in a fantasy of her own imagination... Speaking almost entirely in emotional hyperbole, she regards herself as 'a strange and extraordinary person'... She takes Brian under her wing and one day introduces him to Helmut Griem, a rich, suave, divinely sexy baron with whom they both have affairs... Everyone becomes part of her free world: an unseen father who is indifferent to her; and Marisa Berenson, a young serious Jewish department-store heiress who is feverishly courted by an opportunistic, a fortune hunter, called Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper)..At first Sally's insulated life bears little relation to the events propelling Germany toward its bleak destiny... Gradually, however, the cabaret becomes more threatening; the Master of Ceremonies provides the historical and social themes throughout his songs.. (he and Sally sing 'Money makes the world go 'round').. Later he sings a stimulating 'Two Ladies' about the joys of a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois.. He even dances with a girl in a gorilla costume, singing 'If You Could See Her' adding in a confidential whisper, 'If you could see her through my eyes, she wouldn't look Jewish at all!\"Only once does the film leave the nightclub for a musical number in an outdoor caf\u00e9, and then it is for one of the film's most haunting scenes, where a young boy begins to sing 'Tomorrow Belongs To Me'.. While Fosse's camera pans down to reveal his sinister insignia... started to sing along with patriotic passion... It is a sequence of frightening beauty, made even more memorable by several quick shots of an elderly man, silently sitting on a table.. disapproving the song...When the pathetic Master of Ceremonies tells us once again that 'life is beautiful' and the Kit Kat Girls break into a reprise of 'Willkommen,' the irony is devastating... The final shot of the growing of Nazis in the audience reinforces the menace of the political horrors, and turns the cabaret into a daring place of diverting escapism...As Sally, Liza Minnelli is entirely a creature of cabaret... She sings the title song in a number of stunning effectiveness... The song sums up the film's sardonic view... Minnelli is required to go from a girl of easy virtue proclaiming that 'certain cigarettes make her go wildly sensual' to a helpless person sobbing 'Maybe I am.. just nothing!' --- but she manages to control the connections of mood with style and sensitivity... In one song, 'Maybe This Time', she is too close to her mother Judy Garland.. as the two possess a similar intensity, warm vibrato, the blend of pathos and humor, and an over-eagerness to communicate with their audiences... 'Cabaret' is not unforgettable... It is great entertainment, a daring piece of diverting escapism that hopefully will revitalize a tired form...",

It is an unforgettable film, made by the master, the screen version of his own stage masterwork. It is dark, prophetic capture of \"divine decadence\" that paved the road to the most horrifying hell of unspeakable catastrophe that the world had not seen before. Bob Fosse proved in his only second directed film how talented he was in everything he was doing. Shot entirely on the location in Berlin with the Kit Kat Club cabaret of the title as a real centerpiece of the movie, \"Cabaret\" is a marvel of directing, editing, color settings, that in combination with brilliantly clever and catchy songs, creates the doomed ambiguous atmosphere of uncertainty, hanging onto the present moment, and not daring to imagine to whom tomorrow belongs and what tomorrow will bring. It is impossible to talk about Cabaret and not to mention the international cast of the young talented actors who played the characters of their own nationality. Two definite stars of the film are without doubt Liza Minnelli as Sally Bowles and Joel Grey as creepy devilish MC. For me, the film belongs to Liza Minnelli who gave performance of such energy, charisma, and exuberance, that it has become Liza's calling card and, her claim to cinematic immortality. Under her rather intimidating makeup - her eyes that took up the good half of her face, the eyelashes so long that they can reach the opposite wall of the room, the impossible garish colors of her eyelids that probably glow in darkness unmistakably announcing her presence and colored in dark green finger nails that can be considered the dangerous weapon, Sally is vulgar but vulnerable, corrupted but lovable, oblivious but lonely, talented but stuck in the cabaret Kit Kat Club where the music never stops and life is always beautiful ...In 1973, Cabaret competed for the Best Picture of the Year award with number one of 250 Best Movies as per IMDb users, Francis Coppola's Godfather. Not only it was the equal contender, it won 8 of ten Oscars it was nominated for, including Best Director for Bob Fosse, Best Actress for Liza Minnelli, Best Supporting Actor for Joel Grey (who was against three heavy weights from Godfather - Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall), and Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Cinematography. With all my love for Godfather, I believe Cabaret deserved all its awards, and as time goes it proves to be one of the best screen musicals ever made.",

Beautifully filmed, with a brilliant use of intercuts between the musical songs and scenes of sickening violence in the Berlin of the early 1930s, the film provides an object-lesson in how a musical in film should work, with the songs commenting on as well as advancing the plot. Liza Minnelli is quite simply the definitive Sally Bowles, combining boundless self-confidence with an innate vulnerability. She shows a mastery of tone and shade in her rendition of some of the tunes - in the title song, for instance, she recalls her mother at her best, whereas in the song \"Maybe This Time,\" she reveals the character's inner yearning for a better life. Likewise Joel Grey is definitive as the Emcee - a vicious parodist who knows precisely what the songs mean in terms of satirizing Germany at the beginning of Nazi rule. Michael York's \"Brian Roberts\" (actually Christopher Isherwood) is both bemused yet appalled at what happens around him; he can never become actively involved either in the anti-Nazi movement or the decadent world of the Kit-Kat Club due to his respectable upbringing. He can escape from Nazi Germany; sadly neither Sally nor the Emcee have that privilege. This is the film's principal tragedy.",

            "content": "1973 was a very good year for legendary director/choreographer Bob Fosse. He won an Emmy for directing and choreographing the television special LIZA WITH A Z, he won a Tony for directing the Broadway musical PIPPIN, and blindsided Francis Ford Copolla by winning an Oscar for Best Director for CABARET, the dazzling 1972 film version, which is Fosse's re-thinking of the 1966 Broadway musical. The stage and screen versions are quite different and as independent works, they stand on their own as outstanding achievements and it is not necessary to have seen the play to appreciate the movie. The main focal point of Fosse's re-thinking of the musical is that he wanted it to be a more \"realistic\" musical and therefore made sure that all of the musical numbers (with the exception of \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\")all took place within the walls of the Kit Kat Club. He cut several numbers from the original score, but if you listen, some of them can be heard as background music in several scenes. He also shifted the focus of the way the story is told...the play tells the story from the leading man's point of view, but Fosse switches the focus to the character of Sally Bowles, the brassy, sassy party girl who believes in \"divine decadence' and wears bright green fingernail polish. Fosse also takes two secondary characters from the play, who are older, and makes them young and attractive in order to make their story more youth-friendly, I imagine. Liza Minnelli turns in a dazzling Oscar-winning performance as Sally, a gutsy, self-absorbed party girl who shows signs of vulnerability and a desperate need to be loved. Minnelli makes the most of her musical and non-musical moments in the film...her climactic confrontation with Brian (Michael York)is brilliantly performed. York is charming and sexy as Brian and Joel Grey's Oscar winning turn as the Master of Ceremonies is a delight. The musical numbers are all brilliantly staged and performed, from the opening number \"Willkomenn\" to the new \"Money\" song performed by Minnelli and Grey, to \"Maybe this Time\", the ballad belted out by Minnelli onstage in the empty club. Fosse cleverly counterparts the musical numbers with the realities of what is going on in Nazi Occupied 1931 Berlin with sometimes startling effect. \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" still gives me goosebumps every time I watch the film. This film ruled at the '73 Oscars, winning eight awards in all (it lost Best Picture to THE GODFATHER)and deserved every accolade it received. A sparkling, eye-popping, thought-provoking, haunting film experience that should be savored over and over again.",

            "content": "It's a strongest film I know. Every time I watch it, it bewilders me so I can't turn my eyes away from the screen, even though I remember all what happens by heart. It fills me with a strange mixed feeling of interest-sympathy-admiration-disgust-and-horror. One of the reviewers here called this film depressing, and I inclined to agree. Any picture of Berlin in 1931 must be depressing and frightening. But, on the other hand, there is an atmosphere of desperate reckless joy in the movie. When the entire world goes mad and speeds to a catastrophe, life is a cabaret! Do what you can, come hear the music play, don't permit some prophet of doom wipe every smile away, and end as the happiest corpse! It's one idea. There is also another, more humanistic: live and let live. Brian fails to understand Sally, so they fall apart. Fritz for the sake of his love faces the danger of admitting that he is Jew in Germany. There is no hope for him and Natalia in this country in this time. But he couldn't do otherwise. There are plenty of other ideas too: about money, politics, corruption, perverseness, decadence, stupidity of middle classes, talent, success, etc. The story is very simple and incredibly complicated in the same time. No use retelling it. It must be seen. It's life as it was in 1931 and in many ways as it is nowadays. I suppose that Cabaret would be a great film even without any musical numbers, but with them it is a masterpiece. They say that history repeats itself, for the first time as a tragedy, for the second time as a farce. Well, I would say that in Cabaret every event repeats itself for the first time as a human drama in life and for the second time as a farce on the stage, but it would not be exactly true. Life and farce are shown synchronically or farce even go in advance. But every staged number in divinely decadency Kit Kat Klub ruthlessly shows the naked truth of life. (Only Mein Herr and Maybe This Time have more to do with the character of Sally Bowles.) And of course, Tomorrow Belongs To Me must be mentioned separately. The way of German people towards fascism is presented in one startling scene. And in finale too. That distorted reflection of the audience full of Nazi, accompanied by a tense silence after Master's of Ceremonies \u0091Aufwiedershen' is horrible. The movie due half of its unforgettable effect to the masterful camera shots. Actors' works are absolutely fantastical. Surely, Master Of Ceremonies is Joel Grey star role. He is amazing as that demonic shameless figure that seems to know everything, understand everything and deride everything. Liza Minnelli shines in every scene, acting, speaking, singing and dancing. I know few performances equally true, strong, brilliant and stylish as hers as Sally Bowles. Michael York is excellent as well, though he is often underestimated. It's only his character who is reserved, intelligent and avoids show-off. And he is perfectly British. I really admire York's acting in the movie. There are also beautiful Marisa Berenson as noble Natalia, Fritz Wepper very believable as tormented Fritz, repulsively attractive Helmut Griem as the rich scoundrel Maximilian and picturesque supporting cast. John's Kander's music is wonderful and haunting. Shortly, Cabaret is a work of a genius, or it would be better to say of geniuses: Bob Fosse and the crew and the cast. And it's flawless.",

            "content": "Bob Fosse's most accomplished film is one of the most accomplished films ever made, period.Fosse understood that the days of the old-fashioned Hollywood musical were over, at least as of 1972, so he gave audiences a musical that doesn't feel like a musical. Based on Christopher Isherwood's fine collection of novellas, \"Goodbye Berlin,\" and the subsequent stage musical based on them, \"Cabaret\" takes elements of both sources to create something completely unique. It tells the story of Brian Roberts (Michael York), a British professor who travels to 1931 Berlin to give English lessons to a wealthy heiress of a German Jewish family. He meets the irrepressible Sally Bowles (Liza Minelli, in a dynamite performance), an American and fellow lodger in his boarding house, and the two begin a madcap friendship and sort-of romance, eventually falling in with a wealthy German baron until they all fall out with one another. Meanwhile, revellers come to the Kit Kat Klub, the cabaret where Sally performs, to join the sinister Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey, recreating his Broadway performance) in laughing away the dark cloud of Nazism building on the German horizon.Fosse sharpened his directorial teeth on \"Sweet Charity\" three years earlier, and while I greatly admire that film, I can admit how uneven it is as a movie. \"Cabaret\" proves Fosse to be a master behind the camera, with a directorial style as unique and instantly recognizable as his choreography. The Kit Kat Klub and its devilish M.C. provide stylized commentary on the world rotting away outside the cabaret's decadent interior; the musical numbers don't advance the plot as much as comment on it. Fosse's way of filming musical numbers is fascinating, using quick edits to capture movement from multiple angles almost simultaneously. But what gives \"Cabaret\" its shattering power is the way it depicts the Nazi movement's insidious rise to power even as people were dismissing it as a joke. For all of the film's stylized panache, it provides one of the most realistic documents I've ever seen of just how the Nazis positioned themselves to dominate Germany. It's no coincidence that the film's most disturbing moment comes not in the nightmare, feverish world of the cabaret's stage, but rather in the realistically depicted world of a German beer garden, where the angelic voice of a Nazi youth raised in song becomes a rallying cry and call to arms for the German people. The acting is phenomenal. Liza Minelli gives easily the best performance of her career and one of the best performances in the history of cinema. Joel Grey creates a character who manages to be no one and everyone at the same time. One can't imagine this vampirish imp of a man existing outside of the dark, lurid walls of the cabaret. And Michael York does terrific work as well, even if his role isn't as showy.I think \"Cabaret\" has been underrated because people have labeled it as a musical, and musicals never get taken as seriously as other genres. But I would caution anyone against dismissing this film on those grounds. Yes, there is music in it, but what \"Cabaret\" is more than anything else is a haunting warning about the dangers in any time and place of ignoring the unpleasantness of the present and near future for the hedonistic pleasures of the moment.Grade: A+",

As relevant now as it was then, carrying a tune and warning of creeping fascism, it's staying power is not only in its message but the bite of the music and two of the most memorable musical performances in film history with Liza Minelli as Sally Bowles and Joel Grey as the \"Emcee.\"University student Brian Roberts ( Michael York) freshly arrived in Berlin (Weimar Germany 1931) to complete his studies makes the acquaintance of Kit Kat Club performer Sally Bowles who shows him the ropes. Taken back by her brash personality at first he eventually warms to Sally and they become involved, he more serious than her. Together they encounter and share new friends but Brian comes to the realization that Sally is not about to give up a life of \"divine decadence.\" Meanwhile in the streets, the parks, the clubs the Nazi Party and its brand of thuggery is becoming more prevalent.Outside of a pace slowing subplot regarding two older students Robert is tutoring Cabaret is flawless film making in nearly every area with Minelli excelling in three (acting, singing, dancing) requirements and Grey's mischievously haunting master of ceremonies delivering a character for the ages. Director Bob Fosse working in a confined space smaller than a broadway stage for his musical numbers, the color muted by club smoke, delivers one excellently edited solid number after the next without betraying the mood with slick, flashy choreography on a stage the size of an aircraft carrier that lesser musicals depend on. Instead it maintains the funk of people dancing on a volcano in search of distraction from the impending doom they face. Musicals by nature are usually optimistic and upbeat. Sober Cabaret goes against the grain and succeeds beyond expectation as one of the finest musicals in film history.",

In the 1930s, Europe, the U.S., and the rest of the world were in a horrible economic melt-down. The stage was set for a man like Hitler to use his charisma to take power by giving people - especially young people - an ideal to fight for.I think one of the most effective scenes in this superb, dark film is the way they do the song \"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\". A great song, but to me the way it is done is very effective. It opens with a tight close-up of a young man who starts singing. All you can see is his face. He begins to sing and the camera slowly backs out to reveal that he is a Nazi. Very well done. The young people in the audience are shown in close-ups, rising and singing this song, but, like the lead vocalist, not joyously. To me, it was almost like they're \"programmed\" to rise and sign along with it. The faces are of hate and determination, not joy about a more beautiful tomorrow. It's as if the movie wants to show that they have been brainwashed. They are willing to fight and die if needed for their ideals and one is either for or against them.Also effective is the comment by Michael York at the end of the scene, where he asks \"Do you still think you can control them?\" and then, in a haunting way, we see Joel Gray as the M.C. in his pancake makeup with an eerie \"See, I told you so. There is much more to come\" smile. Powerful stuff. To me, that scene sums up the whole movie.A powerful, tour-De-force show for Liza Minelli and a fascinating commentary on the Germany of the Great Depression.

The scene is Berlin, Germany, only two years before Hitler would come to total power. It is the Berlin that Christopher Isherwood lived in and wrote about: poverty, drug and alcohol escapism, criminals, sleazebags, fighting in the streets,  venereal disease, the prostitution of both sexes, the desperation to escape through the film industry, the temporary escape from the harshness of life in \"naughty\" nightclubs like The Kit Kat Club, which encapsulates it all. It's a bad scene, and a good example of, perhaps, why so many Germans felt in need of a Hitler. There's not a single verbal reference to Hitler, and yet the presence of the growing Nazi movement all around these decadent misfits is ever present in this film. But you can't blame any of these apolitical people for that. Liza Minelli and Michael York's characters are so needy, so desperate just to find some personal happiness in life. They can't be bothered with what's going on in the bigger picture.      Except for the Master Of Ceremonies at the Club: Joel Grey's character is a semi-supernatural all-seeing character, mocking, seeming to somehow know EXACTLY the further destruction Germany's headed for. His scary all-knowing grinning face pops in regularly to remind us. The musical number \"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\" is so effective an illustration of the appeal this new Nazi hope held for impoverished suffering Germans, and yet we have The Master Of Ceremonies' evil nodding grin to remind us, in retrospect, what it really led to.Just as every musical number (aside from being so beautifully choreographed and presented) reminds us of the desperation in Sally Bowles' life and in most of Germany. \"Money Makes The World Go Around\" is a perfect musical number, and so illustrative of the horrendous financial state of Germany at the time. Joel Grey's raunchy \"Two Ladies\" on the Kit Kat stage to the hysterical delight of the decadent crowd reminds us that all sexual propriety has broken down (including in the lives of the main characters, now involved in a threeway with one of the few Germans who still has some wealth intact).

Well, this weekend curiosity got the better of me and I finally broke down and saw it. I was pleased to find a very tightly constructed piece of musical drama, in which the drama and the musical elements are separate yet interconnected.A story ostensibly about the end of decadence in Germany and the simultaneous rise of the Nazi party, \"Cabaret\" winds up being much more. Unlike \"Titanic\"(1997), which also intermingled historical events with a love story, \"Cabaret\" uses the cabaret as a device to comment on the goings-on in the story surrounding it, yet doesn't feel tacked on or phony like the former film. Part of this is because of the wonderful performances all around, and part is the sheer craftsmanship involved in putting the film together. Liza Minnelli and Michael York make us actually care about their characters, and Joel Grey brings a creepy verisimilitude to the Master of Ceremonies. Marisa Berenson, Fritz Wepper, and Helmut Griem put in fine supporting performances, lending dimension to what could have easily been cardboard characters.The craftsmanship of Geoffrey Unsworth and Bob Fosse is no less impressive. I was familiar with Unsworth's work from \"Superman: The Movie\" and was amazed with his ability to make Liza look so breathtaking here. Fosse's direction and staging of the dance numbers is classic Fosse, even if the film had to be tightened up by the studio prior to release. This is great entertainment, with food for thought, and the Kander & Ebb songs stay with you long after the film ends.Come to think of it, so does the film itself.

Of course what could Maria Von Trapp and Sally Bowles possibly have in common, other than the times they live in and how they dealt with them.Cabaret takes place at the tail end of the Weimar Republic era as Sally and her crowd party on while Germany is surrendering its freedom to an authoritarian minded party and its leader. Liza Minnelli is Sally Bowles in what is her career screen role. With the fading away of the musical genre, we don't get to see Liza Minnelli too often as a singer so be grateful that Cabaret is recorded and popularly available. Her role also calls for a great actress as well, so small wonder she won an Oscar in 1972 as Best Actress. Her award was one of eight that Cabaret received. Cabaret ran for 1165 performances from 1966 to 1969 on Broadway and it was reversed there in terms of casting. On stage it was an English woman and an American man expatriate it Weimar Berlin and starred Jill Haworth and Bert Convy. Michael York took the role of the rather naive young man who while renting a room, falls in with Liza Minnelli and her hedonistic lifestyle.Repeating his role as the Cabaret emcee is Joel Grey who was the Best Supporting Actor for 1972. I think it would have almost been impossible to do a film version of Cabaret without Grey. He's one fey and evil man who is quite willing to adapt to the new Germany. My guess is he found a boyfriend later on in Ernest Roehm's SA and later paid dear for it, either killed during the Night Of the Long Knives or died in one of the camps.I've always loved the contrast between the Von Trapp family who saw what was coming to Austria and took measures to flee and Sally Bowles who kept on in her words, going like Elsie. York could see what was coming as did many others in her crowd. One can only hope she did eventually.Liza Minnelli's best song was one especially written for the screen version by songwriters John Kander and Fred Ebb. With all the awards Cabaret won, amazingly that Maybe This Time didn't even rate a nomination for Best Original Song. In an era when good film songs were at a premium, that was inexcusable.One other comparison with Sound of Music. The song sung by the young Aryan pure Germans, Tomorrow Belongs To Me is a frightening number. I could see young Rolf who became a Nazi while courting the Von Trapp eldest being part of that.Cabaret is a film guaranteed to last forever, something that will never date and something we always have to be reminded about.",

            "content": "It's not that I dislike musicals. Maybe it's that I don't quite \"get\" this film. But Cabaret only very rarely worked for me. In a nutshell (I'll flesh all of this out more below), I'm not sure I got the point of setting the film in Berlin during the transition from Weimar to Nazi Germany. I didn't really like the music or the cabaret performances. Very little of the soap opera stuff had any impact on me. I strongly disliked Liza Minnelli and only occasionally liked Michael York. And the direction, cinematography, and most of the technical elements did very little for me. There were a couple things I did enjoy (one not so minor), but you'll have to read on to discover what they were (I need to create _some_ suspense here).Cabaret is the story of Sally Bowles (Minnelli) and Brian Roberts (York). Bowles is living in Berlin in 1931, singing and dancing in a cabaret called the Kit Kat Klub. During the opening, we see Roberts just arriving in town. He ends up at the boarding house where Bowles is living, hoping to acquire a room. He's taking a working vacation from graduate school in England. He plans on earning his room and board by teaching English to Germans.Roberts and Bowles' relationship evolves over the course of the film--that's the gist of the plot. Roberts also makes two friends among his students, Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper) and the very rich Natalia Landauer (Marisa Berenson), and Bowles meets the even richer Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem) at the dry cleaners. All of this is interspersed with occasional cabaret performances (only very seldomly featuring Minnelli) and even less occasional references to the rise of the Nazi party. The bulk of the film is soap-operatic relationships among the characters.Cabaret had a somewhat circuitous trip to the silver screen, starting with the semi-autobiographical fiction of Christopher Isherwood, who lived in Berlin between 1929 and 1933. After Isherwood, the material was transformed into a play and then a film both entitled I Am a Camera (1955). Finally, it became the Broadway show, and after that, this film version, for which director and famed choreographer Bob Fosse wanted to look back to Isherwood's writing. I haven't read Isherwood's work yet, but from what I understand, it has more of an essay-like tonality, and attempts to capture life in the relatively \"decadent\" Berlin of the 1930s in detail.Unfortunately, the end result is that this film version of Cabaret plays like a directionless pastiche of mostly mundane events. The goal seems to be an in-depth portrait of a troubled woman in a troubled-environment, and conjointly maybe a commentary on contributing factors that led to the imbalanced state of both. But what Fosse achieved instead was a random-feeling, poorly acted hodgepodge of soap-operatic nonsense.Minnelli's performance is so loaded with annoying affectations, and she so frequently overacts--not to mention that she's very disturbing to look at--that it kills what little dramatic impact the pithier developments should have. York vacillates between confusion, woodenness and overacting, occasionally finding a balanced middle ground that's enjoyable, but it's like waiting for a slow-moving pendulum to reach its nadir.The Nazi material, including the two all-too-brief instances of society embracing some of the attitudes or ideas, could have been very strong and poignant--especially in contrast to the freewheeling life depicted elsewhere. But Fosse makes no kind of commitment to it, so it ends up feeling like it was added on as an afterthought, like scotch-taping a paper lapel to an otherwise complete cashmere coat.Fritz and Natalia, the two characters that I did enjoy and who had a compelling story that was intimately bound up with rising Nazism, were largely ignored. Fosse spends maybe 10 minutes on them.The music and choreography for the cabaret performances lies somewhere between banal and unpleasantly corny. It has a kind of vaudeville \"shake your derriere to the cowbell\" hamminess, while the choreography involves a lot of mugging--again those annoying affectations--that saps all of the potential effectiveness out of the art direction. Maybe that music was popular in these kinds of German clubs in the 1930s, but would some melodic, harmonic and rhythmic inventiveness--not to mention some finer artistry in the lyrics--have killed Fosse and his composers? It can't be that John Kander and Fred Ebb were unfamiliar with Kurt Weill, for instance.Besides, for the other element I really liked--the art direction and production design--Fosse went out of his way to give us something intriguingly surreal. The look of the film, especially the cabaret scenes, including the garishly painted faces and bizarre costumes and overall appearance of the performers, is based on the visual art of George Grosz and Otto Dix--even going so far as recreating characters from Dix paintings down to small details. I'm a huge Dix fan, so I enjoyed this aspect of the film. But I wanted this aesthetic to be followed in other areas, too, rather than the very pedestrian and unsurprising route that was taken.(By the way, I know that my score of 6 may seem high given my review, but remember that a 6 is equivalent to a \"D\" in my way of looking at ratings. There were at least two elements I liked--with the art direction/production design being very important to the film, and I rate on all artistic and technical elements. The film has passable cinematography, lighting, sound, etc., even if they weren't anything special to me.)",

While not my favourite of the musical genre, it is a hugely enjoyable film. Bob Fosse does have a very distinctive style, and this style works. The photography is very good and never sloppy, and the costumes and sets are extravagant. The songs are equally wonderful, as iconic as the title song is, the one song I was familiar with prior to my viewing of the film, the best song for me is the brilliant Mein Herr, and the choreography exudes charisma and energy. The story is the least exceptional asset of the film in my opinion, not bad mind you in fact it's very interesting but everything else was so wonderful, while the writing sparkles. Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey are both magnificent in this movie and are a joy to watch in any of their scenes. All in all, a great film helped by the wonderful music and lead performances. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This film is set in Belin beginning in 1931. Despite the rapid rise of Fascism, you would never know it inside the bawdy cabaret where much of the movie is set. Here, it is all laughter and gaiety--no sign of the coming war. The apparent stars of this show are Joel Grey (a master of ceremonies who has no other role in the film) and Liza Minelli (an incredibly screwed up American singer and dancer). The utter banality of the cabaret as well as Liza's personal life are a deliberate counter-point to the seriousness of the day. Despite antisemitism running amok, Liza is oblivious to it all--living her hollow and self-indulgent life. How she screws it up and the bizarre relationships she has are makes up about half the film and the rest consists of song and dance numbers. In many ways, it's like two totally separate films fused together.Surprisingly, I found I enjoyed the non-musical portion much more. Liza plays a fascinating character--a perfect film example of a borderline personality. This personality disorder is typified by love-hate relationships, self-absorption, self-destructive behaviors, magical thinking and an inability to accept that they are not the center of the universe. It's obvious that the writers had worked with some mental health professionals to nail this so well. While not fun to watch (after all, who wants to watch a self-absorbed idiot?), it was fascinating. Some of Liza's odd and self-absorbed behaviors included sexual relationships with gay and bisexual men which are destined to fail, extreme promiscuity, alcohol abuse, shallowness and magical thinking. Sadly, in some ways this sounds a bit like Ms. Minelli's real life, though I do wish her the best in her recovery.As for the rest of the cast, they were mostly there for Minelli's character to play off of. Yes, Michael York and others are there, but most of the reason seems to be to provide texture to Minelli's life as well as to provide SOME semblance of normalcy. They see that Germany is slowly descending to Hell, but Liza's character is simply oblivious.CABARET is a very good film, that I won't argue. But for the film to have garnered eight Oscars--that I find very hard to understand. Now it's true that many of these were for musical or set design awards, but still the film doesn't seem that exceptional. Perhaps I am just missing something or perhaps it's because I've seen other films about the Nazi period in Germany that just seemed better. Or, perhaps it's because I preferred the parts of the film where they were NOT singing--for as a musical, it's songs aren't all that memorable. Aside from the rather annoying \"Money Makes the World Go Around\" and \"Cabaret\", most people would have a hard time remembering the songs that play such a prominent role in the film.Also, while I do agree that Minelli deserved the Oscar for her demanding performance, I was very surprised to see Joel Grey get one as well. Yes, he did also work hard, but he really had no lines at all in the film--everything he did was singing and dancing and clowning around on stage. With no life beyond the stage, it's very surprising that he won. I assume that part of this was because with three nominees for Best Supporting Actor from THE GODFATHER, the three actors split their votes--allowing the unusual performance by Grey to grab the trophy. I know Grey can act, as he's been amazing in other roles, but here he just sings, dances and acts bizarre---an odd choice for the award.Overall, while this was a very interesting film, I didn't particularly enjoy it. I know MANY disagree with me and they may be right, but given my tastes I just didn't care for the film. In fact, had the film not improved in the second half, I probably wouldn't have finished watching.A final note to parents. This is a VERY adult film with lots of sexual content and frank discussions about homosexuality and abortion. Think twice before showing it to the kids!",

And the Tony and other awards from other media keep pouring in. The new DVD version is a must. This is the movie that in a very tight Oscar race year (like 1939 with Gone with the Wind, etc.), won NINE Academy Awards. And that against the Godfather! (Part I, just for starters.) The late Bob Fosse did score a major coup by winning the Best Director Award over the favored legendary Director of the Godfather. Fosse's delegacy lives on...on film, and on stage right now in London, Berlin, and New York where the CABARET revival, did I mention CHICAGO?, and FOSSE, the musical- based on his life- including a piece from the movie of Cabaret continue to dazzle new generations.

This film was decadent for the time of Berlin before Hitler's rise to power. As the Nazi movement was gaining power, Berlin residents like Sally Bowles played by the one and only Liza Minnelli had relationships with men and lived on her singing at nightclubs until she meets Michael York (When will he be knighted?) anyway he plays the writer. Joel Grey won an Oscar as the Maestro. I loved the movie and won't bother to see the musical whether it's Judi Dench or anybody else playing Sally Bowles. THere was only one person who played Sally Bowles to me and that was the divine Liza with a Z. She totally becomes the character. When you see this film version, any musical whether the West End in London or Broadway in New York City will always be second rate to this cast. Of course, the fact that Bob Fosse directed this gem and changed the musical films forever from light and happy to dark and sad like in Cabaret. It's eerie to think that the people in the Cabaret have no idea of the horror that lies ahead with World War II and that's terrifying in general.

            "content": "\"Cabaret\" boasted big songs, big ideas, and big actors \u0085 yet it felt long, dull, and convoluted to say the least. Edging on the historical, but focusing mainly on a squabble of young love, the muddled themes of originality, independence, and sexual revolution seemed to take backstage for overacting, choppy editing, and a twisty story that begs for more but desires nothing. In the Oscar world of \"The Godfather\" vs. \"Cabaret\", the obvious winner is Coppola's film \u2013 but how did \"Cabaret\" even get in the running? As it took me nearly three viewings to conquer this behemoth, one has to question the 1972 value, and whether this musical stands up next to the others nearly 40 years later. In this reviewer's opinion, it is an obvious \"no\", but arguments will apparently follow.If discussing this film around the cinematic water cooler, there would be no doubt Joel Grey would be discussed. His portrayal, as small as it was, as the infamous Master of Ceremonies has yet to be repeated in any film to date. In various moments \"Cabaret\" felt like it was directed by Terry Gilliam, complete with the flash and darkness subsequent in his features. Joel Grey brought it to the table, and will forever be a frightening, yet influential image in my mind. He made the nearly 2-hours redeemable. The excitement in his swagger coupled with his level of pizazz completely overshadowed his co-star Minnelli whenever the two shared the screen. His performance alone, the transformation itself, is what made \"Cabaret\" worth a view. It was he and Minnelli's duet of \"Money Makes the World Go Round\" that saved this film from utter obliteration. It was reminiscent of a modern day \"Moulin Rouge\", but it was the surrounding story \u2013 without surrounding characters \u2013 that caused the pain known as \"Cabaret\". One must also applaud Bob Fosse for his direction, for without him, these dark scene filmed with Grey would have just been as bland as the story. Fosse took this flimsy story of three characters that we are emotionally void for, and pulled in some great song and dance numbers to buffer the pain that was sure to follow. His work on \"Lenny\" was outstanding, and while this didn't speak as greatly, you could see his influences on the script and final edit.To bookend the positive, one must also ask \"Where did 'Cabaret' fail?\" Without wasting pages of words, \"Cabaret\" failed because of the sloppy editing, the poorly developed historical slant, and due to the massive disappointment from the actors. This could have been a memorable song-and-dance rooted with historical symbolism-esquire film, but instead fell flat thanks mainly to the horrible nature of Liza Minnelli. Her flat voice matched well with her disassociated character, which carried no emotion, flaunted no values, yet tried to win our heart. She sang decently, but I just couldn't stand behind her as a central focus. Her entire relationship with Michael York is flippant. Does she love him? Does she love money? What is her true background? What does she want from life? Mix these unanswered questions with the uncomfortable hint of sexuality between York and Minnelli, and you have nearly 90% of this movie. From Minnelli's undefined character, to the passive aggressive York duel-jobbing as both language educator and African safari supporter, there just isn't a character you can stand behind. As we get close to the middle of the film, our writer seems to realize this and the extremely vague Maximilian is introduced as a man who enjoys the company of both Minnelli and York. For \"Cabaret\" to work, there needed stronger characters for us to follow \u2013 ones that were defined, yet complex, not just jumping from emotion to emotion. How did Minnelli win an Oscar for this mess? Outside the of intermittent use of Grey, our writer - Jay Presson Allen \u2013 tried to incorporate what was happening in Germany at the time with the Nazi movement, with the chaos of a cabaret show. In theory, this would be a great idea \u2013 but it failed because of again, the lack of focus with our characters. In one scene we are troubled by York's disagreement with one of Minnelli's haphazard choices (a big decision that was diminished by choice) and in the next, we are dissecting the idea of a German Jew. It just didn't flow well together. In another scene, we are forced to listen to a young Nazi soldier sing a ballad that evokes singing from everyone \u2013 and our characters just drive away. For me, to best summarize this film would be one of the final scenes between York and Minnelli as she takes him to the train station. She leaves by merely waving her hand, demonstrating her care for the characters and ours as well. When this film was over, I took it out of my player, walked away waving unemotionally. \"Cabaret\" failed because there was nothing for the audience to hold onto. When the breakout actor was someone that didn't speak but merely sang that should speak about how the film as a whole turned out.Overall, both with presentation and delivery, \"Cabaret\" failed. Minnelli's acting and eyes told a different story, and portrayed a character that just didn't fit for a feature film. What was attempted as original just felt stale after the first several scenes. Fosse's direction and Grey's performance are the only two saving qualities of this film, as the flakey York does his best as a love interest. The dual sexual roles are just too abashing for both the actors and the viewers. I was eager to witness this film, but nearly 40 years later, this film has not held up. Bravo to small part and big directors, \"boo\" to those that think Minnelli can carry her weight as an Oscar winning actress.** Waves eagerly as you leave this review ** Grade: * \u00bd out of *****",

Watching in 2005 (courtesy of a free DVD inserted into a newspaper) a movie made in 1972 is, of course, fraught with built-in problems. This is true of any movie yet some - the Judy Garland vehicles Meet Me In St Louis and A Star Is Born for ironic example - wear their age well and make it easy for the 21st century viewer to appreciate what all the 20th century fuss was about and others, like this one fail, alas, to preserve whatever magic they possessed at the time. The score is serviceable certainly and Kander and Ebb have contrived to create words and music redolent of the tinny harshness that characterized Weill and Brecht who WERE actually writing words and music at the time that Cabaret is set. The overall success of replicating authentic 30s German music is negated by the insertion of Maybe This Time, written especially for both the movie and specifically Liza Minelli, a favourite performer of the composers, and both song and delivery reek of a much later decade and another country. The casting of Michael York doesn't help; another honors graduate of the giant Redwood School of Acting he would have been okay playing against someone less flamboyant and manic than Minelli and with alternative casting the overall effect might have been less like a clash between a Dutch Elm on its last legs and a Mexican Jumping Bean.

This film adaptation of Kander and Ebb's stage musical junks most of the story in favour of exploring the darker side of Berlin just before the Nazis rise to power.  As a musical, it is curious, with the story dealing with a lot of adult themes (particularly the love triangle between Sally, the English intellectual she lives with, and the young dissolute Baron they find who showers them with gifts).  The power of the stage version's Nazi and anti-Nazi themes is buried in a more personal story, but this in itself is interesting.Some of the songs, too, were ditched ('Don't Tell Mama' was one I particularly missed) in favour of a couple of new ones - 'Mein Herr', and 'Money Money'.  As well as Minnelli, the musical and showy strength of the film comes from Joel Grey, transported from the stage version in his bizarre make-up to continue as reflector and commentator on troubled times.  In non-musical support, Michael York does well as the troubled bisexual PhD student finding his life is in limbo; while other, smaller roles playing out their own mini-dramas are memorable.  The best song, however, is the rousing 'Tomorrow Belongs To Me', which allows the Nazi supporters to join in chorus to proclaim their idea of a new world.

            "content": "When director and choreographer Bob Fosse decided to adapt the critically acclaimed Broadway musical CABARET to the screen he took on a daunting challenge. The 1966 hit, a song-filled version of John Van Druten's 1952 play I AM A CAMERA, itself an adaptation of British novelist Christopher Isherwood's BERLIN STORIES, CABARET incorporated both the traditional conventions of the American Musical Theater (boy meets girl , love songs sung by the main protagonists) coupled with the more daring plot device of a ghoulishly painted Master of Ceremonies who comments on the main story's proceedings through song and dance. The musical eerily evoked the decadent, devil-may-care atmosphere of Berlin in the early 30's and the apathy of the citizenry to the encroaching Nazi takeover. As with classic Rodgers and Hammerstein shows of the past, CABARET included a romantic subplot (this time involving an older couple, A German landlady and her Jewish tenant) that strongly tied in with the book's stance against prejudice. But composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb went much further than Rodgers and Hammerstein in conveying man's inhumanity to man : the nature of Evil permeated the entire atmosphere of CABARET. Albeit entertaining,even exhilarating, the new musical never lost sight of the forces that would lead pre-World War 2 Germany to the brink of social and political disaster. In the process of transferring CABARET from stage to screen, Fosse and screenwriter Jay Presson Allen scrapped much of Joe Masteroff's Broadway script and went back to the original source, Isherwood's stories, creating a more intricate storyline and eliminating certain subplots while adding new ones. The German landlady became a mere walk-on role, the older Jewish suitor was gone. The young British writer Cliff, straight in the Broadway production, became sexually ambiguous Brian in the film . British Sally Bowles, the singer in the notorious Kit Kat Club Cabaret, was now an American played by Liza Minnelli. Into this mix was included a wealthy Jewish heiress involved in a doomed romance ; and a menage a taros involving Brian, Sally and a seductive German Baron. This indeed was going to be the most adult rendition of The Berlin Stories depicted in any medium. As the Master of Ceremonies, the androgynous one-man Greek Chorus who introduces the acts at The Kit Kat Club, the producers retained the protean talents of Joel Grey, repeating his Tony Award winning stage performance. Under the meticulous direction of Bob Fosse and abetted by master technicians Goeffrey Unsworth (cinematographer), David Bretherton (film editor), CABARET emerged as a daring , stupendous piece of work. The opening scene introduces Joel Grey, the sycophantic emcee, introducing the audience to the denizens of the seedy cabaret. Throughout the film these musical sequences at the Club are artfully interspersed with domestic scenes between Brian and Sally at Fraulein Schneider's rooming house and other Berlin locations. Simply put, the movie walks a brilliant tightrope act , juxtaposing the cabaret numbers with everyday life outside its parameters. In a brilliant masterstroke, songwriters Kander and Ebb confine the music only to the cabaret numbers, dropping all of the song score sung by the principals (the eliminated songs do make an appearance however, as background music on Sally's phonograph and in public settings!) What impresses one most now about CABARET in the thirty -odd years since its release, aside from its technical triumphs, is the great ensemble acting of its cast. Liza Minnelli's star wattage never shone more brightly than it did in this film. Although turning Sally into an American slightly skews the story, Minnelli is so strong in the part that it hardly matters. Not a subtle actress, her animated delivery is shown to great advantage here , hiding a more exposed creature underneath. In scenes where Minnelli shows her vulnerability, she is deeply affecting. There's a repeat of her memorable Pookie from THE STERILE CUCKOO here, coupled with her dynamic, no-holds-barred stage performances at the cabaret . One of the inherent weaknesses of the film is Sally's desperate longing to be a star, a major film actress. She desperately desires fame but is portrayed in the rooming house scenes as a young woman with only mediocre talent who needs constant reassurance. That idea is totally obliterated when Minnelli takes the stage. She holds both the cabaret and movie audience hostage with her incredible talent, culminating in two unforgettable numbers, the gorgeous torch song \"Maybe This Time\" and of course \"Cabaret\". At the peak of both her physical and vocal powers, Liza Minnelli gave a performance that rightfully earned her the Best Actress Oscar that year. In recreating his stage role for the screen, Joel Grey again demonstrated his brilliant gift of tying all the elements of the story together. With his decadent air, slicked back ebony hair, painted face and rouged lips, he comes across like a living, rotting corpse. It is a chilling sight. Equally impressive is Michael York as Isherwood's alter ego, the young novelist who fatefully becomes involved with poor unstable Sally. Marisa Berenson , Helmut Griem and Fritz Wepper round out a superb cast. CABARET has lost none of its glow over the years ; in fact it looks better than ever. It also has the distinction of stealing some of the thunder from one of the greatest American films ever made. At the March 23rd, 1973 Academy Award ceremony, THE GODFATHER won three Oscars, including the much coveted Best Picture Prize.. But CABARET ran off with eight Oscars, including Best Director for Fosse and Supporting Actor for Grey. It also won nearly every technical award in sight. That this landmark musical film shared highest honors with Francis Coppola's masterpiece only adds to the movie's luster. CABARET is a classic for all time.",

She has never topped her triumph with her Oscar-Winning performance, and even if some detractors say that either Diana Ross or Cicely Tyson should have won that year, she still retains the power of presence, even if the character of Sally Bowles is supposed to be of just so-so talent. Forget the fact that Minnelli is as American as they come, her talents are just too large to indicate that she could be lost in the world of a tacky Berlin nightclub. Like the same era's Josephine Baker, I think Liza's Sally would be more than welcome on the Paris stages of the Moulin Rouge or the Folies Bergere.Then, there is the fact that the film altered much of its story from the musical, being closer to the original play. Those who have seen the original musical (or its recent revisal, back on Broadway once again) can see the power of the fear factor involving the Nazi's coming rise to power as the old world falls to pieces, lives crumble around them, and yet, Sally goes on singing about \"When I go, I'm going like Elsie!\". Gone are the stage subplots of the Jewish grocery store owner who courts a non-Jewish German landlady and the neighbors whose sympathies lie with the Nazis as their powers rise and aren't afraid of exposing their feelings of hatred to the world around them. In its place is an almost bi-sexual subplot involving the American version of Sally and the very British version of Cliff (Michael York) and the menage-a-tois that seems to open up with one of their acquaintances.Certainly, nobody other than Bob Fosse was better selected than to direct this movie, although he was busy with \"Sweet Charity\" in 1966, leaving \"Cabaret\" to Ron Field on Broadway. The dance moves that made \"Charity\" so ahead of its time (especially those involving hats) are very prevalent here, and Fosse instills a delightful sense of trashiness into each and every musical number he creates. Joel Grey sensibly repeats his role as the slimy looking emcee, adding an Oscar to his Tony for the same part, and making us wonder what befalls this strange creature as the curtain falls on his finale \"Au Wiedersein\". Minnelli is genuinely sexy here, especially with \"Mein Heir\", and her vulnerability is obvious with \"Maybe This Time\", not heard in the original, but added to subsequent revisals. When she gets together with Grey for the newly written \"Money Make the World Go Round\", it is as if Judy Garland and Gene Kelly have come back to life in \"For Me and My Gal\", only with a less angelic setting and darker intentions. She rocks the title song off the screen, and it is easy to see why she continues to sing songs from this show more than 40 years after the movie exploded her into the front line of legendary performers. Two disturbing moments that haunt me to this day are Grey's \"If You Could See Her Through My Eyes\" (re-installing the lyrics of \"She Wouldn't Look Jewish at all!\") and the frightening Nazi anthem, \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\", where an angelic faced blonde soldier boy increasingly gets angrier and angrier as the older generation looks on in shock as the world around him falls to crap.",

It's maybe easy in the case of Cabaret, easier than say All That Jazz. But then again, Cabaret was already written and a big hit on Broadway, and Fosse's task was to make it feel real and vibrant in a cinematic setting (unlike All That Jazz, which had the super-ambition of being an original 8 1/2 type of project). After finally seeing the film, it's perhaps not surprising that he won the Oscar that year; this is the kind of craftsmanship that Hollywood was used to, even if it wasn't quite as iconic as the Godfather, which ultimately got picture anyway. It's a musical that *moves* incredibly when it needs to, but also stays close to the chest(s) of its characters, their little dramas played out against the slowly building scale of the Third Reich.It's a story we all know, sort of: American girl finds British boy in late 30s Germany, boy grows attached to girl over some friendly time, boy and girl grow friendly also with German boy hiding fact he's Jewish even from his beloved Jewish girl, American girl may be pregnant with a child that she doesn't know, so on and so forth. Actually, a lot of this is just the stuff of apple-ripe melodrama, full of the little twists and motivations and outbursts and, thankfully in this case, subtleties that make it all so palpable and fresh for audiences. The dialog is also perfectly witty for a movie musical (not quite Singin' in the Rain, but close enough), and ingrained in the setting of a cabaret there's some raunch to be had... within the realm of PG for 1972 of course.But back to the direction for a moment, since there's enough that's already been written about how wonderful Liza Minelli is and how awesomely flamboyant Joel Grey is or how restrained Michael York can be- all terrific in their juicy parts. Two scenes and a shot should be looked at for interest points: when Minelli's Sally and York are under the train tracks, we see Sally scream out, and begs York to scream out too in sync with the train going by above. Just as he's about to scream, which would be the typical thing to see (i.e. Garden State), Fosse suddenly cuts to a man being beaten, this inter-cut with a warped musical number with Master of Ceremonies and his gaggle of girls. It's a sharp cut but it's smart and concise and one is not only not confused but it's refreshing. Another scene is when Minelli is in the woods relaxing with York, him miles away in thought and she trying to sound optimistic as an expecting mother - she then flashes to some moments, visions of the future, of coming home to a kid on the stairs, still with her fur coat, still performing from the past, so on. Then it cuts to her without the coat. This, too, is jarring, but the narrative freedom that Fosse takes advantage of is uncommon in musicals, not just from the period.And one last shot to mention: the final one, as Grey finishes with his \"Goodbye\" bit, and the camera goes by in a slow, deliberate pan actors a scrambled mirror, looking out at the placid faces of the Nazis in the audience. This is, simply, just good artistry of a variety that in other hands might lead to pretension, but for Fosse is meant for any audience member to conceive of and understand. Overall Cabaret works for those expecting the pleasures of a movie musical and film buffs looking for something more: turbulent love and relationships done to some imaginative direction that keeps things surprisingly grounded in reality. If not true reality, then a hyper-reality that doesn't seem too far off - it was in fact the 30s of Germany, depression leading to the rise of Hitler and the \"gang of thugs\". Cabaret!",

            "content": "This globally acclaimed and masterful film was definitely one of the most risky and dared projects in cinema history and thus it also easily could have been one of the biggest failures ever. A cheerful musical about...Nazis?!? Especially during an era when films began to be very spectacular and explicit (\"The French Connection\", \"Deliverance\", \"The Godfather\"), a love-story set amidst the rising Nasism seemed like a very bad idea. And yet \"Cabaret\" is still standing as one of the most crucial films of the 70's, although it has to be said that the actual love story is secondary to the immortal songs and \u0096 especially \u0096 the portrayal of frustrated Germany during the years prior to WWII. Bob Fosse stylishly and appropriately alternates footage from inside the moody bar with scenes from the romantic life of variety star Sally Rowles (Liza Minelli). Sally is involved in a slightly peculiar triangular relationship with German industrialist Maximilian and English language teacher Brian. Meanwhile and all around them, supporters of the Nazi ideas become more and more numerous and their presence soon begins to have a direct impact on the lives of everyone. The acting performances are fabulous, especially Minelli and Joel Grey who plays the sleazy master of ceremonies who pretty much indirectly narrates the whole story. The songs are downright magnificent and masterfully choreographed, with great costumes, make-up and sound effects. The sequence in which Brian and Maximillian are in a public park where the majority of German citizens there seem to permanently turn to Hitler's ideas in intensely disturbing and powerfully highlighted trough an ambiguous song. A lot of film fans, especially around this website, will surely disagree, but Bob Fosse's \"Cabaret\" righteously stole some important Oscars from \"The Godfather\"...Maybe not even enough.",

            "content": "This movie called \" Cabaret \" was originally created as a musical Novel by Joe Masteroff. Taken to the silver screen, it was then expertly directed by master choreographer Bob Fosse who worked himself into a heart attack, directing it. The story tells of Brian Roberts (Michael York) who travels from Cambridge England to Berlin, Germany in 1931, during the rise of the Nazis. There he meets American, Sally Bowles (Liza Minneli) a fun-seeking, well-meaning, but ditsy Cabaret singer. Together they touch lives amid the growing depression enveloping the world. Roberts takes adjoining lodgings in an inexpensive apartment with Bowles and meets a variety of friends like Maximilian Von Heune (Helmut Griem) At her place of employment, the Kit-Kat club, Sally joins the Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey, superior performance) on the small stage. The film is rich with dancing routines and wonderful Musical numbers, like 'Money' 'Two For One' and 'If you could see her through my eyes.' The happiness of the movie is punctuated with background scenes of the growing and menacing brutality of the Nazis. Yet, the movie garnered a flurry of Awards and testimonials and despite it's years on the shelf, has remained a Classic. Recommended! ****",

Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) is a flamboyant bohemian American singer performing at the Kit Kat Klub with MC (Joel Grey). British academic Brian Roberts (Michael York) from Cambridge moves in to finish his doctorate. She falls for him despite him being adverse to women. He teaches English to earn money and one of his students is a rich Jewish heiress Natalia Landauer. She is uncertain about the advances of Fritz Wendel. Sally and Brian are befriended by rich playboy Maximilian von Heune who seems to be interested in both.Liza Minnelli is brilliant. Joel Grey is magnificent. Michael York is put in a tougher spot as a bi-sexual. I buy him more as a homosexual and I like his friendship with Sally more than his romance with her. The biggest deficiency is Helmut Griem as Max. The role needs to be a matin\u00e9e idol and played by a superstar. It's minor but very important to see both Sally and Brian tripping over themselves for the guy. He needs to be magnetic. The Bob Fosse songs are incredible. The inter-cut scene between the stage and the beating by the Nazi thugs is truly compelling. The pacing does go flat at times and it probably could be trimmed a little.

            "content": "I don't usually like musicals. The sight of people bursting into song while engaged in some ordinary activity strikes me as silly. But, as a musical, this movie appealed to me since the musical numbers are integrated into the fabric of the movie by being part of the cabaret where the main female character, Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) performs. The story has Brian (Michael York), a Cambridge student, coming to Berlin in the early 1930s as a private English language instructor. Brian becomes involved with Sally and their alliance is extended to a threesome when Max (Helmut Griem), a German aristocrat, joins the action. The subtle give-and-take among the three makes for engaging drama. There is one exchange between Sally and Brian that I think most people will remember long after having seen the movie.I found the musical numbers well choreographed and visually striking. The numbers are so good, and the production values of the cabaret so super, that I had to feel that either this cabaret was the best in Berlin, or there was some polishing done to make these become knockout numbers for the movie. As opposed to musical set pieces that are non sequiturs in many musicals, the ones here establish context, creating a bawdy decadence played against a menacing backdrop of the rise of Nazism. The only song performed outside of the cabaret was the one, \"Tomorrow belongs to me\" sung by a Hitler youth in a beer garden. This is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a movie. It gave me an insight into the beginnings of Nazism that I had not had, showing how a nationalistic song can possess an audience. In its own way this scene had a more chilling effect on me than the tirades of Hitler. After the song, Brian turns to Max and asks, \"Still think you can control them.\"The acting is all first-rate. I was particularly impressed with Joel Gray as the master of ceremonies of the cabaret--he has an unctuous cynicism that is simultaneously disgusting and transfixing. The cut to Gray's malevolent little smile after the singing of \"Tomorrow belongs to me\" provides a perfect punctuation for the song. Gray well deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. Liza Minnelli gives a standout Oscar-winning performance. York and Griem are well cast and hold their own in roles that are less demanding than those of Gray and Minnelli.",

            "content": "\"Cabaret\" is an American movie that came out over 40 years ago, the very same year that a certain \"The Godfather\" was released as well. These two films dominated the year in terms of awards success with finally \"The Godfather\" winning Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but still scoring less overall wins and with Coppola losing the Best Direction Oscar to Bob Fosse. Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey won their acting categories. You can see \"Cabaret\" from several different perspectives: The first would be as a romantic drama. It is okay as that. I would not say that it's among the best from that genre that I have ever seen, but the romance plots work most of the time and there is actually two of them. The main plot is obviously between Sally and Brian. We see how they meet, how they argue, how they meet other people and it all amounts to Sally's pregnancy. However, I must say that I found the relationship between Wepper's and Berenson's characters at least as interesting. The second approach could be in terms of a political movie and it is a huge success as such. It has references and depth from that perspective that most political thrillers can only dream of. I may be a bit biased here as I always found the second quarter of the 20th century the most interesting era in terms of politics, but still. Then again, it's fairly difficult to set this apart from seeing \"Cabaret\" as a musical movie as almost all the songs have a bit of a political background, some more subtle, some less subtle. The highlight of this was probably \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" as it is finally depicted how unstoppable the Nazi movement had become at that point and how everybody joins in the song as well as the rise of the NSDAP. Or almost everybody as the very old man's ideals obviously differ from the modern image the party was trying to portray at that point.And finally, I would like to give a special mention to Joel Grey. He beat no less than three actors from \"The Godfather\" and without being somehow depreciative when it comes to their performances, I want to say that it's absolutely amazing that his great performance here was awarded accordingly. It may be true that we do know almost nothing about his character in terms of who he is as we only see him in his role all the time, but he created one of the most enigmatic characters in film history and his musical performances are nothing short of outstanding. I would instantly watch a film that shows us this character's real nature behind the mask. The songs fit him perfectly and he is the heart and soul of the film and the time when he is on screen is the most memorable from the whole film to me. No offense to Minnelli. Every one of Grey's songs is a winner. Just like the entire movie. Thumbs up and I urge everybody with an interest in 20th century politics to not miss out on this one. Here in Berlin, it's occasionally still shown on the big screen, probably because it's set in the German capital as well. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Perhaps one of the more impressive films to come out of Hollywood, CABARET soars as both entertainment and social comment. The original Kander/Ebb musical opened on Broadway in 1966 - an adaptation of John Van Druten's 1951 play I AM A CAMERA, which was in turn based on Christopher Isherwood's novella GOODBYE TO BERLIN.Created in 1972, the significant setting in Berlin in 1931 provides the opportunity to re-visit the Nazi rise to power, the prelude to the Jewish Holocaust, and the worldview of homosexuality - all set in parody through the Kit Kat Club with the naughty Master of Ceremonies (the superlative Joel Grey), the lead performer American flamboyant but vulnerable Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli), Sally's gay British roommate Brian (Michael York), her friend the penniless Jew passing as Protestant Fritz (Fritz Wepper) and his infatuation with wealthy Jewess Natalia (Marisa Berenson), and the wealthy bisexual Maximilian von Heune ((Helmut Griem). How these individuals interrelate is mirrored by significant 'songs' on stage in the Kit Kat Club.Bob Fosse is the Oscar winning choreographer and director, and a more sophisticated recreation of a stage musical to the cinema has yet to be made. The performances are all brilliant, not only in execution and style, but also in the manner in which they underline the social commentary of 1931 Berlin - and the world. Repeated viewings serve to enhance even more. A little miracle of a film!",

            "content": "The worldwide effects of Nazism were so devastating that the way Germany was between the end of WWI and the rise of Adolph Hitler in 1932, feels like an insignificant detail.Weimar Republic, hyperinflation, these abstract words have no weight when you compare them to the Night of the Long Knives, the Nuremberg Laws, they're nothing in the great scale of History \u0085 yet during this 10-year parenthesis, Berlin happened to be the hippest of all European capitals, and maybe Paris' most important rival in Arts and entertainment: Otto Dix, Berthold Brecht, Fritz Lang, Von Sternberg, the expressionist revolution, to name a few. Berlin was an artistic melting-pot with such an international radiance that no one could see the Nazis coming. Bob Fosse's \"Cabaret\" is a tribute to this forgotten era, this sensational picture embodies in tone, flash, music and plots the exuberance, flamboyance and 'divine decadence' of the early 30's, while we're all, as viewers, one step ahead of the protagonists. We know that the worst is still to come, and it's impossible not to feel the inner tragedy of the story. With all its 'hotness', \"Cabaret\" is like the heat wave preceding the storm. The whole irony of the film is that we only have glimpses of the Nazism, yet the film says much more about their rising than Luchino Visconti's \"The Damned\" in two and half hours of an indigestible plot. This is a credit to Bob Fosse's talent as a storyteller, and performer, the exhilarating editing provides a nice parallel between the stage: the cabaret and the real-life events, and the result creates a powerful contrast between two sides of German society so in contradiction that only one can triumph, and the course of events doesn't leave much for optimism. But life is so short that even at the dawn of a nightmarish time, anyone is allowed to dream, to have fun.And Liza Minelli's performance is essential to the film, with her genuinely childish smile and sparkle that constantly illuminates her eyes, she's the embodiment of all the positivity that the 'Cabaret' inculcates to the audience. She's not a cabaret artist, she is the cabaret, which is not surprising if you take the cabaret much more than an entertainment but as a state of mind: an eternal desire of escapism, of having fun, of partying and eliminating all the boundaries. Bisexuality, homosexuality, transvestitism, the cabaret trivializes the deviations in the name of freedom and liberty, joy and insouciance \u0085 and these values are incarnated by the second significant performance: Joel Grey as the Master of Ceremonies.If I have no objections against Liza Minelli winning the Oscar for her unforgettable portrayal of Sally Bowles, well, I can't review \"Cabaret\" without mentioning Joel Grey. As an eternal \"Godfather\" fan, I couldn't believe that none of James Caan, Robert Duvall or Al Pacino won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I guess if Pacino had been rightfully nominated as a Lead, things would have turned different, but well, if any performance could beat the legendary film, I'm glad it's this one. I hold no grudges against Grey; he was terrific in a performance that went beyond the musical and linguistic abilities it required. Grey was funny, over-the-top, irritating, feminine, masculine, weird, international, he was the stagy incarnation of the Cabaret while Sally Bowles completed the picture in real-life. But the Cabaret's state of mind is all the more relevant when seen through the eyes of outsiders. The film opens with the arrival of Brian, an English writer (Michael York) to Sally's pension, he's here to teach some English and meanwhile discovers the Cabaret's sideshow and tries to embrace its 'dolce vita', influenced by Bowles' gutsy approach to life. Two of his students are Jewish, Natalia is a rich aristocratic daughter (Marisa Berensom) and Fritz (Fritz Wepper) is an unscrupulous go-getter, who could get jobs because he lied on his religion. While Sally seems rather careless about Nazism, blinded by her Hollywood dreams, the other protagonists are our link to the reality. When Brian violently hits a Nazi flag, the next shot is explicit about the response he received and when Fritz comes to Natalia's house, the first thing he says is that he's a Jew. Next shot, they're getting married, indeed, only a true love could inspire someone to jeopardize his life, but it's also the first awareness that Nazism is not just a 'bit of adversity' but something that shall be fought.That's \"Cabaret\", a battle of spirits, of ideals that affected Berlin, then Germany, then the whole world. \"Cabaret\" is like the desperate cry of a period before it would finally let the winner precipitate the world into War. And all we can do is enjoying the frenzy, the happiness before it's too late. \"Life is a cabaret, old chum\" shouts Liza Minelli at the end, Indeed, all the previous acts showed a parallel between the story and the songs, whether they're about love, money, marriage, sexual plurality \u0085 the trademark will be used by Bob Fosse in his next successful film \"Lenny\", when Lenny's sketches are illustrated by his own experiences. Bob Fosse, an eternal performer, incarnated the truth that art only transcends life experience to universal levels. And what better alibi that the Nazis even fought Art and used them to display their own values which, needless to say, were in total oppositions with what the Cabaret stood for.\"Cabaret\" won 8 Oscars, yet lost the Best Picture against \"The Godfather\", but it is to musicals what \"The Godfather\" is to gangster films, the exaltation of values rather than style, something that speak to the heart before striking the eyes. And the film closes with one of the most haunting shots of cinema's history, with the mirror ball feeling like a Damocles sword pending above the audience. And we know that maybe for once, the show will not go on.",

I am steeped in Cabaret, in other words.Funny thing was I have only watched it one other time, until today, over a period of 38 years and I was only moved to rent the video just to see it again. That was in about 1989. So today, in 2011, I have watched the newly purchased DVD of what I thought would be a fascinating romp through Berlin c.1931. It wasn't. It was boring. Was I shocked!? Not really. After I'd watched the first half hour I remembered how coy I thought it was at the time it was released. The Isherwood novel on which it is based is much racier and decadent and paints a vividly dark portrait of the newly Nazified Berlin. This homogenized, choppy, poorly scripted, poorly acted (except in one case) second rate period piece by Bob Fosse is simply eye candy nothing much more. To Fosse's credit the choreography is splendid, the best part about this movie. The other outstanding performance is Joel Grey's nuanced and frightening Master of Ceremonies in the cabaret itself. I also enjoyed Marisa Berenson at her most beautiful, anticipating her stunning portrayal a couple of years later in Barry Lyndon. She also gins up the only true humor in the entire movie with her charming, wide-eyed daughter of the Jewish gratin in Berlin.Some of the songs are good, especially Mein Herr, but most of them are pretty forgettable, though not as dire as those in famous tuneless shows like The Phantom of the Opera, Chicago and Wicked. Cabaret is dark, but so was Oklahoma! Thing is, Oklahoma! is a classic masterpiece of filmed musical theater, Cabaret is a travesty of an intriguing novel turned into a very shallow piece of Broadway glitz. Liza Minelli is all fingernails, eyelashes and big, moist puppy-eyes. She is utterly tiresome as Sally Bowles, a fatal flaw in any film when the leading actress is a washout. She dances well and has a fine body, she sings okay, the queen of belting, but she can't act, beyond the eyelashes, and her chemistry with ALL the men is zilch. Michael York is perfect, in theory, as the gay leading man, though he's not allowed to be gay here for too long before he and Minelli suddenly find themselves gazing intensely (for them) into each others' eyes and falling into bed. Ho-hum.Was I disappointed? Yeah, I was. Isherwood's book I Am a Camera deserves a great adaptation for the big screen. I don't know if there are any American singing actresses who could bring any more depth to the role of Sally Bowles than Liza Minelli did, so it may all be a moot point. A straight dramatic film of the original material could be great in the right hands.Sorry boys, I know some of us like to dress up like LizaMinelliSallyBowles on Halloween, or any old time, but beyond her parrot-like appearance, she flopped in her great 15 minutes of fame on the silver screen.Still, I give Cabaret four stars for the choreography (which IS great) and a couple of the songs and Joel Grey's creepy mastery.",

I had always assumed it was another musical lost in its time-- you know, one of the Jesus Christ Superstars of the day. But there's a difference: \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" is sensational, electrifying, and at times riveting. \"Cabaret\" is crap-aret.Liza Minnelli is terrible at just about everything, most especially acting. She's a fair singer, but on screen she means nothing. She brings absolutely no emotional weight to the role. After seeing how well the original Sally Bowles, Jill Haworth, could act (please see \"Exodus\"), it's a freak of nature that Minnelli beat her for the role. The entire film is like a punchline and it's all because of the leading lady, who has no rightful place in popular culture except the subject of catty jokes in shows like \"Queer as Folk,\" \"Queer Duck,\" and \"Will & Grace.\" Michael York is, was, and always will be great, but Minnelli actually succeeds in dragging him down to her level. He gave a better performance in the super-camp \"Logan's Run,\" for crying out loud! The only good performance in this movie comes from Grey, who actually does astonishingly well (\"astonishingly\" considering the quality of his costars). But even his best efforts aren't enough to salvage the whole thing.As opposed to the fearlessly stylized visuals of his directorial debut, \"Sweet Charity,\" Bob Fosse under-utilizes master cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth. The film has no visual scope and even the exterior scenes are so dank and so poorly constructed cinematographically that they, too, look like they were shot in someone's basement.The only good song? \"Mein Herr,\" a rare moment in Hollywood History when Minnelli's camera-centric sleazing actually works.Whatever you've heard about \"Cabaret\" from its proponents, don't listen. It'll drive you crazy. The film is terrible, visually glum and uninspired, poorly scripted, dismally acted, and shoddily slapped together, haphazard. For all the bad things people say about 1972's \"Man of La Mancha,\" it doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. The worst crime of all? The awards \"Cabaret\" stole from \"The Godfather,\" a true classic of American cinema.A note about my personal tastes: I *love* musicals. Seriously.

That is what great art does, reveals even deeper meanings as times moves on. The film is masterpiece of direction and editing. Indeed all the technical aspects are top notch and even after all these years the film is striking the way new films are when you first see them. Each time I watch it I get lost in the visuals again. This might be a minority opinion but I actually think York gives the best performance in this film. He's sensitive and natural. Brian is not the easiest character to play and I like how York doesn't judge his character's bisexuality.

            "content": "In the early thirties, American Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) is doing what she loves most, singing in front of an audience. Nevermind that its in the somewhat seedy world of cabarets and the pay is not overwhelming. She keeps a small flat in a large boarding house and, one day, gets a new neighbor. He is naive Brian (Michael York) who is a Brit with a yen to teach English to Germans. Shy and reserved, Brian is struck by the outspoken, daring singer and doesn't quite know what to make of her. Or, for that matter, the cabaret itself, where songs are scandalous and politically charged. Also at the musical watering hole is the Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey) who is talented performer with a cynical, risk-taking demeanor. Naturally, at this time, Germany has been in the throws of a deep monetary depression, having been severely punished by the victors of the first World War. Citizens flock to the cabarets to forget their troubles. But, more disaster is ahead of them, as the Nazi party is slowly taking over and the Jewish population is being humiliated, treated as scapegoats for all of the country's ills. Against this backdrop, Sally and Brian \"hook up\" with each other, a match which may not be made in heaven. Also, since they have become friends with one of Brian's students, a beautiful Jewish heiress (Marisa Berenson), will the political situation test the loyalty of friendship? This is a powerhouse of a film, being a political musical which doesn't \"sing anyone's troubles away\". Yes, the songs are catchy and buoyant, up to a point, but there is always an undercurrent of tension and despair. The cast is truly superlative. Minnelli won a much deserved Oscar for her matchless work, while York, Berenson, Grey, and all of the others are great, too. Sets, costumes, script, photography, artistic assets and direction are all worthy of high praise as well. Therefore, if you were born long after this film was released or if you just want to finally see a film you've heard so much about, seek out Cabaret.",

            "content": "A love story set in a Berlin night-club during the rise of Nazism.Musicals, more than any other form of film, are the most dangerous to make: It only takes one or two bad songs, an ill-chosen star or an ill-judged theme for the whole affair to collapse, not just in to failure, but in to an object of  public ridicule. Think about the film version of A Chorus Line for a minute.However when they fire on all cylinders - as it does here - you have something that will live and play forever.Director Bob Fosse's name will, indeed, live forever with Cabaret which not only works as a great musical, it also operates  as a fairly good love story and imparts (without too much depth) a sense of time and place drama. For these combined reasons I think it is the best musical ever made.Liza Minnelli was born to play Sally Bowles the brash and breezy night-club performer. She turned that year's Best Actress Oscar in to a one horse race. Michael York will never get a better part and plays it to perfection; although hardly a technically demanding performance. Joel Grey was good (and deserved his Oscar) as the spooky compare, but having said that plenty of actors could have played the role just as well.The best thing about this movie is that really does look like a Berlin night-club. The dancing is not ultra-slick, the make-up is thick stage slap not the movie variety. The place really does look dusty, seedy and cheap. The songs sound like they really would be performed at such a place. The original stage version - so people that have seen it say - was much more standard in musical performance and  values.Those wanting the whole story of the rise of Hitler as well will be left disappointed. The politics of the day hang in every frame, but they are mostly background rather than foreground; but allow a sense of \"let's enjoy ourselves while we still have a chance.\"The only fly-in-the-ointment is a homosexual sub-theme that some viewers might not find to their taste.If you like musicals and can live with a bit of  a limp-wristed camp then Cabaret is a film for you.",

            "content": "Anyone who caught Joel Grey in his last tour of the stage musical Cabaret would almost certainly have to agree that the production as presented in the 1960s was looking a bit staid and conventional - words that were never meant to describe Cabaret. This shortcoming was overcome brilliantly in the amazing Broadway revival from a few years ago. Unfortunately, the film version shares neither the narrative strengths of the original stage production nor the energy and canny instincts of its latter-day revival. Director/choreographer Bob Fosse makes some very strange and not necessarily good decisions in rendering the material from stage to film. Most detrimental is his choice to cut any musical numbers that cannot be placed on stage at the Kit Kat Club in Berlin (with one notable exception), which means a large quantity of numbers fall by the wayside. To somewhat compensate, he has added some new material, of which only Mein Herr is really memorable. He has also cut or minimized characters from the source and failed to suitably replace their loss. For instance, the doomed second-string romance between a German landlady and Jewish tenant, which resonates strongly because this may be their last chance at love, has been replaced by a romance between rich beautiful young Gentile Marisa Berensen and poor Jewish guy Fritz Wepper, which has absolutely no dramatic impact at all. Berensen comes across as a spoiled glamor puss only mildly disappointed in the thwarted romance, which is depicted very half-heartedly by Fosse. It seems inconceivable that Grey won an Oscar up against the majority of the supporting cast from The Godfather. Not because he is bad, but because his role as the Emcee is so inconsequential in the film. He really has no wow moments and his much-acclaimed \"Money\" number is even watered-down in that he is forced to share it with leading lady Liza Minnelli. The leading romance in the film is a total bust. Michael York and Minnelli share no chemistry. Fosse adds a new character played by Helmut Griem to turn it into some kind of bisexual love triangle, which must have seemed daring in 1972, but the allusions to naughtiness are all we are left with and it simply fails to impress. As for Minnelli, Cabaret would become her last cinematic highlight. She is not remotely convincing as a second-rate chanteuse in a run-down Berlin night club, nor is she believable as an object of lust. With so much make-up splashed on her and her unflattering bob cut, Minnelli often comes across as Divine's svelte younger sister. She does well by some of the songs, but her Sally Bowle's has no depth whatsoever. In both the Isherwood stories and in the stage play, Bowles may well be a self-destructive party girl, but she comes to realize it. Minnelli seems to have no self-realization whatsoever. When her character has an abortion in the play, she recognizes both her self-destructive and selfish streaks. In the film, when Minnelli claims not to know why she had an abortion - she really appears to be clueless - as if a page of her script got stuck together. In all versions of the play, the Sally's have realized that the \"happy corpse\" of Elsie sung about in the title song actually may well be herself. In the film, Minnelli belts out the number with no introspection or subtlety - she realizes she has a hot number and nothing more. I think Minnelli is quite accomplished in the earlier Sterile Cuckoo, but this must have been a really weak actress year at the Oscars if her over-the-top mugging and sledgehammer delivery is what took home the gold. Unfortunately, she has been playing this way on screen - with mercifully less frequency - ever since.",

This one however had some disturbing elements that I wasn't expecting, even though the film has a forty year history and a host of Oscars to it's credit. I'm referring to the juxtaposition of the rise of Naziism that parallels events at the Kit Kat Club against the private lives of Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) and Brian Roberts (Michael York). The film sets us up for the eventual downfall of all concerned, most in ways that are depressing if one dwells on them for too long. The concept of 'divine decadence' is given ample opportunity to permeate our viewing senses, and gains a gradual progression as director Fosse takes us through the musical numbers hosted by the trans-gendered Master of Ceremonies portrayed by Joel Grey. The fact that he scored an ace at the Oscars against three formidable \"Godfather\" challengers is a testament to the outlandishly garish performance he gives here, alternately playful and lighthearted, at other times sinister and even racist ('If Only They Could See Her Through My Eyes'), while performing with a Monkey Girl representing the Jewish people. It's all very unsettling against a backdrop of the club owner beaten up by Nazis, and Brian receiving the same treatment when he challenges their 'crap' on a street corner. However the most unsettling sequence, given historical twenty-twenty hindsight, is the overtly patriotic appeal to the Fatherland led by the Hitler Youth singer ('Tomorrow Belongs to Me'). Elder Germans, undeniably uncomfortable but powerless to express dissatisfaction, are helpless but to accept this inevitably rising threat to their homeland.So much for thinking that \"Cabaret\" was simply an all out musical. Liza Minnelli's performance here was absolutely breakout, given her prior career essentially appearing on variety TV shows in the decade leading up to this film. Her contenders for the Best Actress in 1973 were certainly formidable enough, and I'll have to reserve judgment until I see some of those other pictures. But overall, this one's a unique viewing experience and an eye opener if you like your musicals straight up. This one is anything but.P.S. Listen attentively to Minnelli's character when she counsels Natalia (Marisa Berenson) on her relationship with Fritz. When she says \"I'm no good at all if anybody cries\", her voice rises a notch and at that moment sounds exactly like her mother Judy Garland. Think Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz\".",

            "content": "Berlin in 1931 was a liberal, some would say decadent city; the first world war had been over for some time and the dark years of Nazi rule had yet to begin... in this setting we find our protagonist; American cabaret singer Sally Bowles. One day she meets Englishman Brian Roberts; he rents are room in her apartment and gives English lessons to get by. The two of the become friends and later on lovers; this is complicated when she meets Maximilian, a wealthy baron, who showers her with gifts and gets close to her... and Brian! In a side story Brian's student Fritz falls in love with Natalia Landauer, another student who is also a wealthy Jew but is unsure how to go about letting her know. As the film progresses the Nazis rise from being a relatively minor group to being the dominant force in Berlin Society; a force that will change things forever. Interspersed with the story we see a variety of songs being sung in the Kit Kat club with either Sally or the unnamed Master of Ceremonies performing.The primary story isn't exactly deep but that doesn't matter as it is well told; Liza Minnelli and Michael York go great jobs as Sally and Brian; the former showing that she can sing as well as act. Joel Grey's performance as the club's sexually ambiguous MC is another highlight despite him having little to do with the main plot. The film's greatest strength is that it doesn't concentrate on the rise of the Nazis; it happens in the background; gradually; in the way that such politics gradually corrupts a nation... the moment we see a young boy singing 'Tomorrow Belongs To Me' turns from pleasant to ominous when the camera moves back to reveal his Hitler Youth uniform. The film contains several great musical numbers; all of which take place on the stage of the Kit Kat Club... so if you are the sort of person who doesn't like musicals were people break out in song as they do ordinary things you can still enjoy this! The inclusion of a bisexual love triangle, transvestites and abortion may have been shocking when the film was released; now it is unlikely to shock most people but nor does it distract from the film as it is something that feels natural in the setting rather than something forced in just to shock. If you like musicals this is probably a must see but even if you don't it is well worth watching.",

She is fun loving and wild and befriends Englishman Brian Roberts when he comes to live in a room in the house she is staying in. As the friends become lovers, the rich Max von Heune also comes into their lives and threatens to divide the two. As the cabaret continues, the nature of Sally and Brian's relationship changes and the anti-Semitism and the Nazi party begin to rise in Germany.This film is on many professional critic's top 100 list and is also generally well regarded by most people so I thought I'd better finally get round to seeing it. While I think the film was enjoyable and worth seeing, it is far from the classic that time seems to have painted it as. The actual story doesn't really work that well even if the relationship dynamic makes it interesting. The fact that I didn't really like any of the main characters was a problem for me and it stopped me getting into their story as well. It is still enjoyable enough but not as engaging as I would have liked. The other threads of the film also distract from it despite one of them being better than the main narrative \u0096 the cabaret numbers themselves.The musical numbers have a great sense of period to them and get the tone right \u0096 naughty but not out and out crude like the modern equivalent can often be. They are cruelly funny and quite daring (not by today's standards but the film takes us back to their time) and fun to watch. If only there was anything good to say about the film's clumsy attempts to bring the rise of the Nazi's into it \u0096 it doesn't do anything with this strand but it is obvious that is somehow meant to fit in rather than just be a background. The worst example of it is the man being beaten up while the camera cuts to a cheering audience \u0096 how much more obvious can you get?The cast do well but the best roles are those around the cabaret performances simply because it is the strongest part of the film. Minnelli is good, as much as I hate to admit it. Her performance in the main narrative is good even if her character is difficult to like or really relate to \u0096 but I won't deny her the praise for playing it well and for being good during the musical numbers. I suppose on the basis of her performance she deserved the Oscar, maybe all the more so for not having great material. Likewise Grey deserved his as he is great fun and very enjoyable in the film's best scenes. Without any musical numbers to help him out, York only has his character's story to work with and therefore delivers a rather unsure performance that doesn't work to the same degree that the material doesn't. Likewise Griem and Wepper (who appears almost annoyed with the plot he is lumbered with!). The stars of the film are the musical numbers and this is apparent from the Oscars going to those involved with them rather than the cast involved solely with the main narrative.Overall this is an enjoyable film but not a great one or anything approaching the requirements for me to call it a 'classic'. The actual story isn't as good as it needed to be and the background rise of Nazism is badly handled. Luckily the musical numbers hold it all together and keep the film interesting and enjoyable even if I must admit to be left feeling disappointed by how uninvolving the story and characters were.",

            "content": "1972's Cabaret...is not your ordinary musical. The old clich\u00e9 is that musicals are supposed to make you happy. This particular film, not so much. Director Bob Fosse, who spent lots of time around musicals in Hollywood and on Broadway, did not shoot this film like a musical. It is a dark tale that reeks of desperation. It depicts the Weimar Republic in Germany as Nazism was on a fast rise. It showed the decadent underbelly of Berlin in the early 1930's. The club, The Kit Kat Klub, is everything that the German Nationalists, later known as the Nazi Party, wanted to destroy. The movie takes some time getting used to, but it is one of those movies where it is completely worth the watch because it stays with you for a long time. Even if you somehow hate it, you'll remember the imagery and the songs.Bob Fosse was quite a character, In his movies, he also acts as choreographer and he is an excellent one. He did an amazing job blocking out the dance moves. The subject matter of the film is very interesting. Just like the 1966 play the movie is based upon, it touches on subjects that were controversial back in the day. These subjects include and are not limited to; bisexuality, Nazism, etc. One of the characters, Brian, is a bisexual. The play's original writer thought this film portrayed it in bad taste, but I am not too sure about that. The movie became a major hit within the gay community. Liza Minnelli became a gay icon with her flamboyant, cheerful personality as seen here. As homosexuality became more popular during this time period, so did Nazism. There was a very powerful scene where the Hitler Youth sing \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me.\" That was a very scary sequence as it shows how strong nationalism can be.In 1931, Brian Roberts (Michael York) shows up in Berlin to finish his German studies. With little money, he teaches English to put money in his pockets. He stays at an incredibly cheap boarding house where he befriends one of the tenants, Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli). Sally works at the Kit Kat Club as a singer and dancer. This club is overseen by the mysterious, creepy emcee The Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey). Sally wants Brian to become one of her many lovers but learns that Brian is not exactly a straight man. Enter the German baron, Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem). Now a love triangle is forming. Their friends and Brian's students are Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper) who falls for the straight-laced Jewish Natalia Landauer (Marisa Berenson). While these friends have their adventures in Berlin, the Nazis are increasing their power. Perhaps the main characters do not notice...or even care.Liza Minnelli won an Academy Award for her performance. On the outside, Sally is warm and has bounds of energy. On the inside, there is some darkness which she brings out during her song-and-dance routines. My gosh, can she perform! I never was high on her as actress, but my opinion changed after watching her performance. Watch her sing \"Mein Herr\" or the final Cabaret song. They are some of the best choreographed songs ever seen in a musical. Joel Grey, in the same role as the play, brings a very strange aura to the role of the emcee...and in a good way. I loved his strangeness, his creepiness, and the ability to sing and dance. He apparently did not get along with Fosse because Fosse himself wanted to be the emcee but was overruled by the producers. As for the rest of the cast, two solid thumbs up!Cabaret was released at a time where people were tired of musicals. The 1950's and 60's are no more. The happiness emitted from the musicals is long gone. By 1972, no one wanted to pay top dollar for a musical. Then Bob Fosse came along. He did not shoot the film like a normal musical. Cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth captured the decadence of the Berlin nightlife. He did an amazing job, especially during the musical performances. Along with the lighting, Unsworth has some of the best camerawork you'll see from any movie this decade (the 1970's).This is a strange movie, but I definitely liked it. It is better than I thought it would end up being. There are moments of slowness from time to time. I liked how the film tackled issues that could have been taboo; bisexuality, abortion, etc. Yes, it is a very bold movie. There are scenes that will stick with you. Remember those mud-wrestling girls? Anyhow, give this film a look!My Grade: B+",

And the music is mostly doleful. Set in 1931, the Cabaret is Berlin's smoky, hazy Kit Kat Club, wherein a cocky, sneering, grotesquely made-up M.C. (Joel Grey) lords over a mishmash of performers, one of whom is Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli), singer/dancer and actress wannabe.But like vultures, uniformed Nazis hover in the plot's background, an ominous harbinger of encroaching evil. Effervescent Sally tries to block them out of her mind as she performs on-stage, and welcomes a potential romance with Brian (Michael York), a youthful, handsome guy just in from England. There's a \"live for the moment\" attitude among all the characters. The Sally/Brian relationship is marginally interesting. But the heart and soul of the film is the Cabaret with its terrific lighting and art direction. Most of the film's songs are sung here, either by Sally or the M.C. or both. A couple of songs are just awful. But most are at least melodic, the two best: \"Maybe This Time\" and the title song at the end.At one point Brian and his friend Max are at an outdoor beer garden. Suddenly, some teenage guy, healthy-looking, normal, and bright, starts singing \"Tomorrow Belongs To Me.\" And he sings with gusto. Then the camera slowly pans down, to reveal on his sleeve a Nazi emblem. Soon, others join him. In this film, the curse of Nazism is never far away.\"Cabaret\" is a hard film to judge. You have to admire the cinematography, set design, art direction, era costumes, and bizarre makeup. Acting is acceptable, though Liza tends to overact in some scenes. And film editing is absolutely terrific. But the visual and musical tone is relentlessly downbeat and dreary, yet appropriate given the political climate. Desperation seems to be the underlying message. \"Cabaret\" is a film about ordinary people clinging to their feel-good moments amid impending cultural collapse.",

You can have `real' things, you can have `imaginary' things, you can have real people doing imaginary things. You can, in fact have dozens of types of `folds' of interesting relationships between elements IN the performance and the act of giving the performance. Musicals are natural for this kind of folding, especially the `Moulin Rouge' kind of musical. That was an extreme exercise in overlaying one abstraction on another and then flattening them: book, absinthe vision, outer play, inner play. The anachronisms of the songs stretched the levels in other directions.Here we have the absolute simplest musical folding: there is never an overlay between the world of the story and the world of the performance within. The two are kept straight for the most part. All the songs are on a stage within the story. So we have two amusements here: the first is a rather simple story about an aimless life as it wanders through sexual exploitations and confusions in a hostile world. The second is the stage act itself, which is presented to us more or less as it was/is presented to the German audience of the 30s. The brilliance of the film is supposed to be the superposition of these. Some of this works, for instance Minelli's `acting' is a collection of stage movements and we never really register whether we are watching a stylized reality or a `real' reality in which a person has chosen to be stylized (a la Holly Golightly) in order to survive.But other elements of this are shockingly ineffective. The basic appeal comes from our enjoyment of watching the show, but this is at the same time we are repeatedly and bluntly shown that watchers of this sort of thing are less human, less real themselves, because of it. Another dimension: Nazism spread largely because of its theatrical trappings, a path long blazed by the decadent tradition we see here -- the Berlin stage made Hitler possible, just as it previously (and still does in the UK) `performed' the country in terms of its elite. We sense this, we can't avoid it since the point of the enterprise is to raise the issue the other way: politics into the play. But it is glossed over in a way that makes willing conspirators of us.How far we have come, from this unintegrated sorting out of the mechanics of performance to what we have now with the recent `Rouge' and `Chicago.'Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

The late fifties and early sixties saw three of the greatest epics ever made, \"Ben-Hur\", \"Spartacus\" and \"El Cid\". Within about five years of this last, however, the genre was to all intents and purposes dead.Something similar happened to the musical which, along with the war film and the Western, was a casualty of the cinema revolution of the seventies and virtually disappeared by the end of the decade. Yet the opening years of that same decade had seen two very fine examples of the genre, \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and \"Cabaret\".\"Cabaret\" is set in the Berlin of 1931, the dying days of the Weimar Republic. Brian Roberts, a young Cambridge academic living in Germany, falls in love with Sally Bowles, an American-born cabaret singer from the city's Kit Kat Club. The two begin an affair, but this does not prevent Sally from sharing her sexual favours more widely. To complicate matters further, Brian is bisexual, and he and Sally share a lover, the aristocrat Max von Heune. There is also a sub-plot about Sally's friend Natalia, a wealthy Jewish heiress, and her lover Fritz. Fritz is also Jewish, but in the growing climate of anti-Semitism has concealed this fact, passing himself off as a Gentile.The traditional Broadway or Hollywood musical, such as \"Fiddler on the Roof\" or \"The Sound of Music\", observed a convention whereby the main characters would periodically burst into song, regardless of whether or not they were in a situation where people would normally sing in real life. The purpose of these songs, of course, was to convey the characters' feelings in musical form. \"Cabaret\" departs from this convention. Four of the main characters, Brian, Max, Natalia and Fritz, do not sing at all, and all the songs, with one exception, are heard during performances at the Kit Kat Club.Most of the songs are performed either by Sally or by the sinister, camp, leering figure of the Emcee, the club's Master of Ceremonies. Although the title song \"Come to the Cabaret\" is a cheerful one with a \"live and be happy\" message, the others, like \"Mein Lieber Herr\" and \"Money, Money, Money\", sound cynical and jaded. The jazz-based score is much less lyrical than that of most Hollywood musicals. Some German cabarets from this period specialised in political satire, often with a left-wing slant, but the atmosphere in the Kit Kat Club, with its scantily-dressed female performers and transvestite male ones, is not one of ideological commitment but rather sleazy decadence and world-weary cynicism. Contrary to the words of the song, staying alone in your room might not always seem such a bad option by comparison.Earlier musicals such as \"Showboat\" and \"West Side Story\" had shown that the genre could deal with serious subjects such as racial discrimination and juvenile delinquency. \"Cabaret\" deals with an even more serious theme- the rise to power of the Nazis. Nazism is an ever-present theme throughout the film, although in the early scenes the Brownshirts seem like no more than thuggish gangsters. As the film progresses, however, we see how their influence is growing. The management of the Kit Kat Club cynically pander to the national mood by including anti-Semitic sketches in the show; a man who has fallen in love with a gorilla sings \"If you could see her through my eyes- she wouldn't look Jewish at all!\". In the final shot of the film we see, in a mirror, that most of the audience are now wearing Nazi uniforms.A key scene comes when Max and Brian drive out to a country inn. The sunny German countryside comes as a pleasant contrast to the Berlin scenes, most of which are sombre and gloomy in tone. This is where we hear the only song sung outside the club, the Nazi anthem \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\", musically by far the most lyrical song in the whole film. (The devil here, quite literally, has the best tune). At first the song is sung by a single young man, but soon nearly all the beer garden customers, especially the young, join in. (Only one old man shows his disdain). To modern eyes this scene is a horrible, sinister one, but it serves as a salutary reminder that in 1931 there were many young men and women who believed that tomorrow belonged to them, who saw Fascism as an idealistic alternative to poverty, unemployment and the decadence of the Weimar elite.In most years \"Cabaret\" would have been a strong contended for the \"Best Film\" Oscar, but in 1972 no film was going to beat \"The Godfather\" to that award. The Academy did, however, try to even up the honours by awarding it eight other Oscars, including \"Best Director\" for Bob Fosse (ahead of strong competition from both Francis Coppola and John Boorman for \"Deliverance\"). I have never agreed with Joel Gray's \"Best Supporting Actor\" for his role as the Emcee- showy and a technical tour de force, but lacking the emotional depth of Al Pacino's performance in \"Godfather\". Liza Minnelli's \"Best Actress\", however, was well deserved. This was something of a career-defining performance- she has made relatively few other films, none of them as well-known as this one. Here, however, she succeeds in showing us the human, vulnerable side of the outwardly hard and brassy Sally. Even when Sally aborts her unborn child on a whim, breaking Brian's heart, Minnelli shows us that there were reasons for her action.Musically speaking, I can think of plenty of film musicals that are better than \"Cabaret\". When, however, it comes to the strength of the acting, the emotional power of its story and the significance of its themes, there are few that can match it. 8/10.",

Even after 36 years, it hasn't aged, and is as shocking and entertaining as ever. It deservedly won 8 Oscars in spite of competition from one of the most beloved movies of all times The Godfather. Although the academy is notorious for decisions based on emotions rather than merit, in this instance, I consider the splitting of best direction and best picture Oscars between the 2 films as a just outcome. It's therefore very surprising, it's not on any of the all-time-great lists - a great injustice, or could it be a conspiracy? It'll certainly be on my list of 100 all-time-great movies.",

            "content": "It's a drama set in 1931 in Berlin, Germany, centered on a cabaret in which the acts mock almost anything.There are three principal characters, two secondary characters, and a magnificent Master of Ceremonies. Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) is the lead singer and dancer at the cabaret. She's an extroverted American who desperately wants to get into films and is willing to sleep her way to her destination. Brian Roberts (Michael York) is an introverted Cambridge scholar working on his doctorate and in Berlin to study. He needs to support himself by teaching English. Brian ends up across the hall from Sally in a boarding house occupied by various interesting characters. Sally and Brian get involved over time, but their relationship is disrupted when a wealthy Baron, Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem), enters their world, generating jealousy and relationship chaos.Secondary characters are Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper), one of Brian's students who becomes a friend, and Natalia Landauer (Marisa Berenson), a young wealthy Jewish woman who also becomes a student. The relationship between Fritz and Natalia becomes a secondary storyline.The Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey) at the cabaret sings, dances, and makes sideways comments about the affairs of the day, and the songs reflect what is happening in the characters' lives and the country.Throughout the film, hovers 1931 German economic chaos and the increasing influence of the Nazi party.\"Cabaret\" is a great movie. In some ways, it's not a true musical, though the music and dancing are essential to the film. The film's editing is unmatched and never lets the viewer forget the political context. Joel Grey and Liza Minnelli deserved the great recognition they received. The other significant characters are also excellent. And the film introduces the sexual themes of bisexuality and possible transgender characters in the early 1970s.",

            "content": "The pursuit of happiness, enshrined as a right in the US Constitution, is one of the greatest motivating factors in all of human history. It can also be one of the biggest distractions. CABARET, from the musical by Kander and Ebb and directed by Bob Fosse, is sort of an examination of this through the historical lens of late Weimar Germany as it succumbed to Nazism. Liza Minnelli is Sally Bowles, a dancer/singer at the Kit Kat Club who has dreams of becoming a famous actress; and Michael York is Brian Jordan, an English philosophy student who is in Germany for cultural enrichment and to make some money. Both of these tragic figures are the conduit for the audience, with Sally being the fantasy side of things and Brian being the reality. As with CHICAGO, although a little less so here, the musical numbers don't just move the story along (all while being organic) but also comment upon it as well. This, for me, is what sets Kander/Ebb musicals apart from the rest. Nazism begins as a mere nuisance but, as the film progresses, becomes more of a presence (and present threat). This is mirrored in the pacing of musical sequences which are initially spaced out a little sparsely but become more frequent as the film goes on. From an interpretive standpoint (and this is just my opinion), this implies (through the nature of what a cabaret is and entails) that our willingness to be entertained and distracted, even if only temporarily, is what allows political extremism/tragedy/etc. to insidiously take hold. No scene in CABARET is more chilling than when the young Nazi starts singing (what I think is) a folk song, and his audience gradually joins in with him. In fact, this entire musical is filled with pathos of varying types, which is why I think it's so effective. The cabaret is a metaphor for the ways we try to mask our pain, to find happiness, but it often comes at the expense of our dignity. From a technical perspective, all of the performances were solid with special marks being given to the leads. However, Joel Grey as the Master of Ceremonies was just as entertaining, perhaps the most so as his role provided dramatic and musical unity to the film. He was also simply hilarious to watch. There was also dynamite editing, choreography, lighting, etc., making it a sort-of ancestor to the music video. If there's one complaint I can levy, it's that the film takes a little too much time to get going, although once it gets into gear it doesn't let up. All things considered, CABARET is a stunning accomplishment that still holds relevance in this day and age of disillusionment with the political establishment. I'm a little hesitant to draw parallels between the America of today and the Germany of then, but it's a little disconcerting to feel like the only thing keeping us from making the same mistakes is that we've never suffered the abject humiliation that Germany suffered at the end of WWI. On a more positive note, CABARET exists as a testament to the power of entertainment, and definitely deserves its status as one of the best musicals ever put to film.",

            "content": "I have seen a staged version about two/three years ago here in San Francisco. It was a small stage with an audience maybe of about 100. That closeness created an intimacy with Nazi Germany that I did not welcome. A huge Nazi flag unfolds. The characters sing that song on stage: \"Tomorrow Belongs to me.\" The separation between performance and audience is lost in that small venue. And that may be the most important part of the play. What side would the audience member be on? Perhaps, more than likely, the wrong side--we would be on the side of the Nazis.In the stage performance, Sally sings \"Cabaret\" in a minor mode--that is to say a mode of mourning. Liza Minelli belts out the tune in defiance of the moral position she finds herself in, or--more likely--oblivious to the moral position she finds herself in.What happens in the Kit Kat club is a reflection of Germany's fall into moral nihilism. The characters in the performance will descend--if they had not already descended--into moral decay. The ultimate moral decay is the abortion Sally Bowles will undergo, an abortion of a child who might be Brian's, Max's, or the emcee's--or anyone else's. But one could easily assert without too much of a stress that that abortion is no different than what the Nazi's did to the Jews. To me--as a person raised in Catholic orphanages--that has always been a powerful message to the film.\"Tomorrow belongs to me\" must be one of the most moving, sumptuously beautiful songs in the entire Broadway musical repertoire. If we re-read Goethe's FAUST, one of the points of that play is the attractiveness of evil--attractive in that evil attracts. Perhaps like a spider web attracts a fly or a moth and the insect cannot extract itself from the web. Attractive in the sense that one just might enjoy such evil--as in the ease of orgasm with homosexuality. Or the ease of self-flagellation with the moral conundrum--thou shalt not...--of abortion.The emcee--and here Joel Grey will forever be enshrined--provides an important anchor to the film's moral tone. \"She doesn't look Jewish at all\" might be funny in Weimar Berlin, 1933; after 1945 such anti-Semitic remarks are offensive; the song is intended to be offensive. The morally ambiguous relationship between Sally and the emcee reflect that ambiguous moral relationship of Weimar Germany. Hitler did not have to come to power; every one knew what National Socialism meant. He was appointed chancellor because--well, in my view, a senile von Hindenburg was morally weak. But like a train wreck, there was most likely no real alternative to Hitler and to what was going to happen in Nazi Germany.At the end of the movie, there is an executioner's drum roll--the kind of drum roll given when a person is to be executed. The camera pans over the audience of Nazi soldiers--where Nazis were not allowed in the club at the start of the film, they are the audience at the end of the film. The audience knows what happened in Germany after Hitler's rise to power, January 30, 1933. Six million Jews would be killed; that drum roll is for those Jews. And a drum roll for so much more. It's not surprising that a short 15 years later Bishop Robinson would write \"The Death of God.\" And that Kierkergaard--that dark Danish theologian --would enjoy a resurgence. In the Holocaust, did God die? Not an unreal question even if no real answer.The movie / play asks a great deal of the audience. That it manages to convey so much in such a short space of time is a tribute to its principals and to its musical numbers.",

Cabaret won 8 Oscars including Best Director for Bob Fosse.You might think that back in the day that Academy voters would be elderly and conservative. They gave the top Oscars that year to a violent grandiose gangster thriller and the first X Rated musical.Cabaret adapts the stories of Christopher Isherwood with a heavy dose of the late 1960s counterculturalism and Bob Fosse's unique dancing choreography.It is set in a Hedonistic part of Germany of the 1930s. There is rampant hyperinflation, economic misery but the Kit Kat Club set in the seedy part of the city has an anything goes attitude where you can forget the troubles around you. Trouble is rising, the Nazis are growing in strength and this film shows it. Ordinary people suddenly finding their message palatable and suddenly sing nostalgic songs with the Hitler Youth.Those of the upper class who thought the Nazis will get rid of the communists realised that it was too late. Who would get rid of the Nazis. The film deals with antisemitism and the vicious thugs who beat up those who stand in their way.Micheal York plays Brian the young English middle class man who has come to Berlin to teach and meets the decadent Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli), a decadent, free spirited American would be actress whose father is a diplomat. She is somewhat needy for attention, especially if the men are wealthy.She befriends who we discover is gay and later both have an affair with a wealthy German Baron.There is also another side plot of one of Brian's student, a gigolo falling for a rich heiress who is Jewish.The central plank of the film is the cabaret numbers at the Kit Kat Club itself introduced by the Emcee (Joel Grey) who also performs the gaudy, bawdy numbers and sketches including women wrestling in mud. We get big show numbers like 'Money Makes The World Go Round' and 'Bye Bye Mein Herr' that depicts the depravity experienced by some in 1930s Berlin. A shock to Brian who finds himself sharing a urinal with a transvestite one night.However the cabaret adapts to the changing face of Germany while the Emcee makes caustic messages through the song and dance routines such as the man who has fallen in love with an ape. The cabaret is really like the chorus in a Greek play. Minnelli and Grey won Oscars for their roles which included song and dance. For Minnelli this was the star making role for her allowing her to step out of the shadows of her famous parents. Yet York gets overlooked, he brings the right amount of vulnerability to his role. It really his coming of age story and we can see that in the end as he gets on the train as a changed man.",

            "content": "Certainly legendary choreographer Bob Fosse was the ideal choice to stage the dance scenes in this jazzy 1972 feature film version of \"Cabaret\", based on the same-titled 1966 Broadway musical smash, based on the John Van Druten novel, \"I Am a Camera\" (also filmed in 1955), based on a single chapter of Christopher Isherwood's \"Berlin Stories\" memoirs.  The musical practically begs for Fosse's dark, interpretive genius.  So it should come as no surprise that he tops even that great feat sitting in the director's chair.     Armed with a formidable, intuitive style, a bold script, dazzling camera work technique, and an explicit eye for detail, Fosse brings fascinating life to the seamy ambiance and tainted attitudes of a pre-Nazi Germany.  In doing so, Fosse performed a major tune-up, reshaping the Broadway show for film...and improved on it nearly 100%.  Every alteration, small or big, every little tweek added infinite power, vitality and nuance to the dark, foreboding atmosphere.  It's an intelligent metamorphosis.  \nIn bringing Lisa Minnelli aboard, who was born to play this role, certain character adjustments had to be made from the musical which starred Jill Haworth and Bert Convy.  Sally Bowles was originally a free-spirited Englander, but here (obviously) she's a capricious American who revels in the pretentious glitz and perversion of early 30s Berlin.  The naive American writer/teacher (Brian in the film, Cliff in the Broadway show, Chris in the Van Druten play, and Isherwood in real life) is now a naive Britisher (played by a very appealing, understated Michael York), who is finally \"outed\" in this presentation, adding dimension and sparking more interest in this flawed spectator (or \"camera\").  In addition, the musical's secondary pairing of Fraulein Schneider and Herr Schultz is eliminated entirely here - which is fine, because although the elderly pair gave the musical a nostalgic, sympathetic tone, they also bogged down the proceedings.  Schneider is only glimpsed here as the German landlady and Schultz as her elderly Jewish paramour is out altogether.  Instead, a younger, more red-blooded couple, Natalia and Fritz, are brought in for the same discordant purpose and the luminous Marisa Berenson and Fritz Wepper are wonderful in their discovery of each other, while dapper Helmut Griem as \"Max\" serves a different purpose in the film.  Instead of a Nazi smuggler, he plays a well-to-do playboy, bringing new meaning to the word \"idle rich\" as a highly versatile love conquest.Some things, however, should never be tampered with.  And they aren't.  Joel Grey reprises his Broadway creation as the seedy, repulsive, yet transfixing Master of Ceremonies, the embodiment of decadence and defiance whose \"shows within a show\" brilliantly transcend the script and encompassing drama. John Kander and Fred Ebb tailored new songs (\"Maybe This Time\", \"Mein Herr\", \"The Money Song\") especially for the talents of Minnelli and Grey, both Oscar winners here, and its to the credit of both writers and performers that these new songs have been incorporated into stage revivals ever since.While Bob Fosse's film direction of \"Sweet Charity\" left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth, his Oscar-winning work in \"Cabaret\" left me hungry for more.  A brilliant turnaround for this icon who had a real affinity for exploring the dark side.  He went on to impress film audiences with his lacerating biographical study of foul-mouthed comedian and drug addict Lenny Bruce.",

We all do stupid stuff when we're young. Boy was I missing out. I'm finally welcomed to Berlin in 1931. A city and story spilt between Nazis out on the streets and decadent performances in the clubs... or the Kit Kat Klub at the very least. Brian (Michael York) is new in town finding himself a room in a boarding house with amongst others, Sally (Liza Minnelli). He's a bit overwhelmed by Sally and he's a right to be, she's a whirlwind. The Kit Kat is where Sally works and where we spend much of the time to start. It's a bit of a dump, wooden boarded stage and minimal props, but what Sally can't do with a chair isn't worth knowing. She's undeniably the life-force of Cabaret, singing, dancing and flirting, but there's a wonderful supporting cast too. York's Brian, prim and uninterested in women (until Sally) is the perfect counter. He's calm, but equally delightful. Teaching English to make ends meet and... make inroads in Berlin society, although not always to his pleasure. Amongst the frivolity on stage, much of which is orchestrated by the Kit Kat's ghoulish unblinking Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey) who only seems to exist on stage. Encouraging mud wrestlers and mocking Nazis. There's plenty of humour off it too. Minnelli again proving her comic chops, often at poor Brian's embarrassment. That seems to be the core of this. Despite the rise of the Nazis and the poverty they live in \"Life is a cabaret!\"... except it's not is it. Sally and Brian make a great onscreen duo, two lost souls, trying to make sense of or simply find happiness beyond the surface fun, but as great as Minnelli is and she really is, I can't help the sense that she's playing herself. York though is the control. His performance more measured. The realist with a heart. For a while things seem to work in their ramshackle existence. The fun never lasts though does it. Sally, naive, all wide eyed nervous laughter with no off switch, drags Brian into a world he's unsuited for. Not just the decadence, but the rise of a fascist society. Which will ultimately lead them to choices, subtlety handled in the closing scenes. It's very good, quite unusual, a little flawed but with enough depth to make it work and to be honest there's not that many songs.",

            "content": "Bob Fosse directed a grand total of five movies, Cabaret being the second, and he apparently wanted little to do with the song and dance in film, working to move away from the stuff he was known for on Broadway. Well, when he chose to adapt Cabaret for the big screen, his producers were going to get song and dance out of an adaptation of a Broadway musical directed by a famous Broadway song and dance director and choreographer. And yet this tale of Weimar Germany falling to Nazism is just odd stuff for a song and dance musical in any combination, and Fosse leaned heavily into the anti-musical tendencies of the story.It's the tale of two people, a British author, Brian Roberts, and his fellow renter at his pension, the singer Sally Bowles, as they live their little lives while Germany descends into totalitarianism around them. It's kind of interesting that you could cut most of the Nazi stuff out and you would have a nice little movie about two flawed people looking for love and connection. What makes the movie special is that the Nazi stuff is always at the edge of the frame. Almost never brought forward to take center stage (except in the one musical number done outside the Kit Kat Klub), Nazism's rise provides a rather stark contrast to the little lives playing out at the front of the stage.As Brian and Sally unsteadily fall in love, get roped in by a rich baron who takes both as his lover, and then discarded, things obviously are getting darker around them, but they all trust that \"Germany\" will make things right. That \"Germany\" will ignore the Nazis. That \"Germany\" will ensure that nothing bad really happens to their country. However, what very subtly happens is that the crowd of Nazis and those who support them in the small moments that they appear grow in number as the movie goes on. First it's a young man handing out leaflets in the club, then a small gang in the shadows beating someone. Then a young man singing a song (written for the stage musical) about how Tomorrow belongs to him with everyone but Brian and the baron joining in. Then a pair in the streets handing out leaflets followed by them beating Brian in broad daylight. They simply grow in power as the movie goes on while Brian and Sally negotiate their little lives with Brian translating a bit of smut from German into English for pay and Sally singing and dancing in the club every night.Now, all but one of the numbers is done on the stage in the Kit Kat Club, and they use a shocking amount of editing. Watching this very shortly after Singin' in the Rain, it acts as a contrast to the earlier film in rather drastic form for how to present dancing in film. Where Kelly and Donen kept their camera back to capture all the motion, the Broadway veteran Fosse heavily relies on editing to capture specific moments. From leg kicks to hands pounding on the ground to even specific moments of singing, Fosse was interested in using editing to highlight particular moments, cut together quickly. It never gets confusing or feeling like we're missing anything, it is rather judicious use of the technique, but it still remains interesting in contrast to traditional Hollywood musicals.There is one particular cut that really sticks out in the best of ways. It's completely non-traditional and effective in equal measure, ensuring that it's going to stick with the audience. As the number \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" is coming to an end and Brian and the Baron drive away, we suddenly see the Emcee of the Kit Kat Klub looking gleefully devilishly into the camera for about a second before cutting right back. The Emcee always felt a bit outside of the movie, having introduced the audience to the film in the fashion of a Greek chorus (and later saying goodbye in a similar way), but this moment solidifies it. The Emcee knows what's coming, what the moment means, and how off put we, the audience feels by it, and he's gleeful at the prospect. Is it the moment's intended effect on the audience that makes him happy? Is it that he looks forward to the Nazi reign? It's hard to tell considering how enigmatic and opaque the character is, functioning almost exclusively as a portal to debauchery on the stage of the cabaret, but it's still a moment that sticks.Weimar Germany was not a place that could really be called decadent, but the movie presents Weimar Germany as just that. The glittering display of debauchery at the Kit Kat Klub is something out of the American flapper era, not pre-war Germany, but the movie doesn't really seem to be aiming for any kind of historical fidelity. It exists outside of that moment, reflecting the 70s, when the movie was made, back to the 30s and imprinting itself on that time. However, the message of the film seems to be much more universal than just a retelling of events of a gay author in 1930s Germany. The central idea really does seem to be that people who refuse to engage with the world will be subject to it whether they wish it or not. Just as Brian and Sally tried to ignore the Nazi menace, so shall the Nazi menace do nothing of the sort to them.Sally spends the movie hoping against hope that she'll be a big star, but she's never going to go anywhere. With Liza Minelli's pipes, it's a wonder why she wouldn't. I agree that she's simply too good a talent for the role, but it doesn't make her appearance in every number all the more compelling. \"Money Makes the World Go Round\" is a personal favorite, but it's obviously the final rendition of \"Cabaret\" that gets all the attention. She belts out the number with all her heart and talent, and it's compelling to watch her, as Sally, lie to herself in those final moments about how much meaning she has in her life. That the movie ends with a slow pan over a warped mirror to rest on the reflections of two Nazi officers shows the depth of her self-deception.This really is a great movie, the anti-musical designed to make you feel depressed rather than elated. Watching this back-to-back with Singin' in the Rain was a fascinating little experience. Two musicals, diametrically opposed in every stylistic and narrative way, and both of them great in their own ways, using the form of the musical to completely different ends. Compelling, wonderfully acted, and a great watch, Cabaret really is a great film.",

It wouldn't make any difference if she was Amercian or not, she was more on the ball. Although I found the storyline really boring, the music really stood me out. I honestly loved 'Maybe This Time' since it is a very well known song and of course it was covered many times by different artists including the TV show 'Glee'.

AA produced Friendly Persuasuion, Love In the Afternoon, El Cid, 55 Days at Peking, and somehow managed to stay in business though it had no lot to garner rentals, no TV unit to offset the film division. Its movies such as Soldier in the Rain were shot at nearby Paramount. AA did have creative people like Billy Wilder, Gary Cooper, William Wyler, Audrey Hepburn, John Huston, David Niven, Sophia Loren, Steve McQueen, Ava Gardner and even Elvis Presley in its movies. Somehow it was able to stay afloat and entered into one of the first co production deals this one with ABC (before it was acquired by Disney). Cabaret is a brilliant film with kudos to all involved especially Director Bob Fosse and star Liza Minnelli who hit a grand slam home run and won the Oscar in the role of Sally. Liza's performance is almost like a 3D movie, it jumps from the screen! Brilliant!Cabaret was up against The Godfather which won all the major awards save for Liza had it not been, Cabaret would have surely won Best Picture. As for AA, it went on to produce Papillion a major hit with Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman and The Man Who Would Be King, (Co produced with Columbia) with Sean Connery directed by John Huston. One of its final films was Billy Wilder's little seen masterpiece Fedora with William Holden, Henry Fonda. But that time the studio was failing and it could not distribute Fedora as it should have.",

            "content": "That period being, of course, the early 1970s. Here, Liza Minnelli gets the Barbra Streisand treatment from Bob Fosse - right down to the fingernails - and becomes a big movie star by essentially playing herself - or, to be more precise, the \"Liza\" character she'd already been honing in her nightclub act for several years. Everyone else just fills in the scenery. Whether you love it or hate it depends very much on how you take Minnelli and her frenetic, arm-waving style - and how appalling you find Fosse's choreography, which was already entering its drill-team, fingers-snapping-in-unison final period. Some things please endlessly. Some, unfortunately, just date.The passable Weimar-pastiche songs of Kander and Ebb and the leering, \"decadent\" Kit Kat Club MC and his orchestra of doxies can't hide the fact that the whole conception is pure candy-cane American Entertainment. The subplot about the meet-cute couple played by Marissa Berenson and Fritz Wepner is pretty bland, and the movie's attempts at seriousness vis a vis the Nazi threat are ham-fisted and obvious. (Just because they're \"Serious\" doesn't mean we have to take them seriously.) The relationship between Sally Bowles and Michael York's Isherwood stand-in is more interesting, given the sexual politics of the early years of the post-Stonewall era, but only up to a point. Is it really so much of a surprise that \"Brian\" has slept with the rich Maximilian, I wonder, when we already know that he's sleeping with Sally, who's done up more or less like a drag queen in every scene? I suspect some of the trouble has to do with Jay Presson Allen's script, with its typically telegraphed Big Points, rather than with Fosse, who was trying to transpose a musical to film in an imaginative way. I suspect also that without Minnelli, there wouldn't be much to look at, and the pretentiousness of the original musical would just be lying there in painfully plain view. With her, however, it's all her show - if that's your pleasure.",

Sally Bowles (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Liza Minnelli, daughter of Judy Garland) is a stage performer with a very likable voice, and one day meets English gentleman Brian Roberts (Michael York). Basically this film shows their little on-off love story, the interferences with it, and the musical life that Sally lives on, and off the stage. I think this film is quite essential for all of its quality songs and music, and obviously Minnelli and York make a good film couple. Also starring Helmut Griem as Maximilian Von Heune, Oscar, BAFTA (newcomer) and Golden Globe winning Joel Grey as the fantastic Master of Ceremonies and BAFTA and Golden Globe (supporting and newcomer) nominated Marisa Berenson as Natalia Landauer. The director Bob Fosse was against Francis Ford Coppola for The Godfather for the Best Director Oscar, I can see why he won, he also won the BAFTA and was nominated the Golden Globe.

The story's transfer to the screen cannot have been easy but Fosse succeeds. He intercuts scenes of Nazi brutality with the stage shows and the decadence of the Kit Kat club is captured. One of the most chilling scenes still mesmerizes me. A fresh young healthy teenage boy sings the first verse of a German folk song so sweetly, then gradually the song takes on a menace and by the end of the number the audience (including some young girls)are all standing and singing in unison and victory and the boy is revealed for what he has become - a Hitler fanatic. One of those moments on film that cannot be forgotten. Michael York is sweet as the uncertain homosexual. Joel Grey is unforgettable as the MC of the club, manic and all knowing.

Sex and booze are pretty well enjoyed in Berlin, 1931 and Nazis are, thus far, a joke of organization spouting \"tripe\" to be ignored.Fosse seems at first to be only focused on the melodrama of an annoying foursome. A first date is in front of anti-communist posters. Second dance number interlaced with a Jew being beat up. First fight between secondary couple and two Nazi youth members drops a dead dog on their doorstep. Each personal drama is surmounted by a gain in society by the Nazi party. Sally herself is nothing short of a 20 year old version of the crazy old bat Miss Minnelli we have all come to know and in sitcoms the last decade over. But here she is \"an underage femme fatale,\" complete with a shapeless body and Josephine Baker haircut. Her lover Brian Roberts (Michael York, you know him as the old mentor of Austin Powers) is stuffy and British. Secondary characters include the bi-curious Maximillian, worrisome rapist Fritz and na\u00efve darling Natalia. Yes folks, if ever you've wondered \"will rape win me the girl?\" you now have your answer: \"of course! Especially if it's a vulnerable Jew.\"There's some bad over-dubbing in a little boat scene which I can only imagine makes Fosse roll in his grave with aggravation to this day. Luckily, for my devout love of Fosse, everything else is characteristically perfect: shot composition, editing, color pallet are all polished. Themes are tightly controlled in the sets, writing and music. It really is unfortunate that three of the four main characters are so heinously annoying.Easily the best thing about the film, though, is the cabaret host. He is our narrator, and bookends. He lets us know what's going on behind Minnelli's uber annoying presence. His androgynous and mime-ish expression is delightful as he sings the narration of the film in a super fake German accent. He lets in Fosse's signature surreal conduit to his true message: the Nazis were bad for hurting Jews, sure, but REALLY they were bad for shutting down the clubs and doing away with drag queens and everything that is fun. PS. Liza Minnelli won Best Actress for this. Just because she's Judy Garland's awkward daughter doesn't mean she should go around getting credit for exemplifying infuriation.",

            "content": "It's a sad fact that a period movie will almost always reflect the year it was made more than year(s) it takes place. Take, for instance, Julie Christie's hair in \"Dr. Zhivago,\" or Kate Beckinsale's...well, entire appearance in \"Van Helsing\" (although, was that even an issue in that steaming pile of bad FX?).One of the best aspects of \"Cabaret,\" then, is that it truly does feel like you're watching a movie from 1931. Well, sort of. If it were made in 1931, it would almost certainly be in Black & White, have primitive sound quality (sound pictures still being relatively new at that time), and maybe be a little less frank about its homosexual content (although being that 1931 was a year pre-code, who knows...). Perhaps a better way of putting it is: \"Cabaret\" looks like you're watching actual events from 1931, not 1931-by-way-of-1972. The costumes, makeup (the overly arched brows and pancake makeup of the KitKat girls is just as creepy as it is sexy, if not more so), sets, and even attitudes are practically a living postcard of Weimar Germany (as far as this 23 year old American can tell). There are no glaring anachronisms here. It's astonishing.Another is the character of Sally. Fledgling writers are always encouraged to make their protagonists as sympathetic as possible, otherwise what will care about their journey? Sally is flighty, shallow, self-centered, and proves that she can be bought. Why do we love her so? Why do our hearts break when her father stands her up after she spent the first half an hour lying about how much he cares for her? More important than sympathy (or empathy) in a character, IMO, is dimension. With good, there is bad. With pattern, there is contradiction. Sally, above all the aforementioned characteristics, is career driven. And no one's gone to the top without a little white lie or two (or three, or four...). Of course, dimension or no dimension, the wrong actress (or even poor acting by a great actress) could make this character fall flat. It's because of that, that one cannot speak of this role without mentioning the sparkling Liza. Those who dislike the movie often site Liza's \"over the top\" acting as a chief flaw. I don't see that here. Perhaps if she were the Sally from the stage production brought over to film, this would be the case, as sometimes stage actors forget how intimate a medium film is (the severely under-rated RENT does suffer from this occasionally, for example). Her singing, while jaw-dropping to say the least, is just one part of her role. Watch this girl ACT. Look at the giddy expression on her face when Max volunteers to \"corrupt\" her and Brian. Watch her desperately (and eye rolling-ly) try to impress the upper crust at a dinner party. Watch her try and play down the immense physical pain she must be in after a back-alley abortion. Yes, she has an amazing voice, but this is performance that would scream \"Oscar!\" even if there were no singing at all.But, \"Cabaret\" IS a musical. Another sad fact is that when showtunes become standards, they lose almost all of the potency they have IN CONTEXT. Sure the title track IS a fun song and all - \"Come to the Cabaret, old chum! Life is a Cabaret!\" - on its own. But watch it where it belongs - it's quite depressing. She's lost a good man, friends (I doubt she'll be seeing much of Fritz after the wedding), and in the end her career is in the same spot it was when the movie began. The Nazis, once dismissed as a thuggish cult, are growing in number. How much longer does she have to be safe? Better enjoy what she has left. See what I mean? This is a dark musical, folks. No \"happy ending, fade to black\" here. The songs, all performed in the night club, avoids the suspension of disbelief required for other musicals when characters randomly burst into song on the sidewalk. And though they don't further the plot along in the strictest sense, they do parallel. \"Two Ladies\" is sung while Max, Sally, and Brian drive to his mansion. \"Mein Herr\" is sung when sexual tension begins to arise between Sally and her new roommate? Foreboding? I think so.And what can one even say about Joel Grey that hasn't already been said? Pure. Genius. No one else can make you simultaneously laugh and feel uncomfortable like that.\"Cabaret\" is a brilliant watch: dark, clever, complex, but un-deniably catchy and not dated by a long shot. You'll get chills and frown at the end....but then you'll rewind to the beginning and watch it all over again.",

The cabaret audience and its reaction are left out of the picture most of the time, the camera concentrating on the singing and dancing. The choreography and costumes are top class and the acts soon become the most interesting part of the production.Against a background of Nazi propaganda there are the continual rumblings of anti-Jewish sentiments in 1931 Berlin and a nervous anticipation of events likely to follow. But the MC invites his audience to leave all their problems, their worries, their cares outside and enjoy the cabaret where everything, just everything, is \"beautiful\".Intertwined with the stage presentations at the cabaret are the off-stage relationships between Sally and her lovers. Understandably these scenes do not quite sparkle like the rest of the film. I do however enjoy the scene where Brian Roberts (Michael York) and Sally get a little tipsy, clink glasses and make a toast \"Here's to you and the baby\".Liza Minelli has beautiful eyes which she uses to great advantage.

This is set in a dark and gritty atmosphere, inside and out of the night club, despite Minnelli's pizazz-filled singing and dancing outfits. It was well-edited, acted and sung and while emotionally rich, shows how these people had their eyes set inward and not outward to the rising hate around them.",

They have been trying for years to get me to watch the movie, so finally after 21 long years I finally sat down and watched it. I have to say that my mom and sister are very interesting people to love this musical, but I can see how it is so popular, frankly it is \"fabulous\". The characters are adorable, somewhat odd, but it was all in good fun and it looked like they had a terrific time doing this film.Sally is a performer who has big time dreams of becoming a famous actress one day. Her life changes dramatically though when a handsome young British man, Brian Roberts, comes into her life and just sweeps her off her feet. Together they find a passion that they have needed in their lives for a long time. But another man enters their lives, Maxamilian, who also seduces Sally and Brian into a life of passion, life, and music while the whole world in is in great depression over the Nazi party taking over.Cabaret is a timeless musical that will never die, I'm sure it will be on Broadway for a very very long time. The music was fun and the actors must have an absolute blast with this musical. I would recommend the movie if you are into musicals, this is a semi-strange film, but I think that you'll get a good kick out of it. After all, in there life is beautiful.7/10",

            "content": "\"Cabaret\" is a somewhat curious film that won eight Oscars in 1972 and almost blindsided \"The Godfather\" for the best picture of the year. The film is about a young American dancer (Oscar-winner Liza Minnelli) working in an adult nightclub in 1931 Berlin. She is very sexually active and has had many loveless relationships with many men. Two new men in her life catch her eye (Michael York and Helmut Griem). What follows is one of the strangest love stories during the history of the cinema. Minnelli is an expert in sex, York is a bi-sexual, and Griem has characteristics of both Minnelli and York. There are suggestions of three-ways and homosexual undertones throughout the course of the film. Unfortunately none of this adds to the film. The fact that the Nazis are slowly coming to power in Berlin is an important side-story that is never explored as much as it should be. Bob Fosse's (Oscar-winning) direction is pretty good, but the musical numbers at the Kit Kat Klub never do add to the film the way they should. The under-achieving screenplay does nothing to help out this problem either. Joel Grey (Oscar-winning) tries to provide musical insight as the master of ceremonies at the club, but instead of adding to the film he quickly becomes a huge minus. \"Cabaret\" is very well-made, but there are some problems that keep the film from being as good as it should have been. The musical scenes are disappointing as they make the film overly wrong and never do create the impact that they were meant to have. Liza Minnelli is the film's greatest asset. She turns a character that could have been very flat into a person who is very complicated and difficult to figure out. Michael York is also impressive as a deep character who, like Minnelli, is in limbo in a place that is slowly spinning out of control. Helmut Griem is not very good though. He struggles through the middle of the film and he never does keep up the intensity created by Minnelli and York. Joel Grey won a curious Oscar as he did not have one speaking line that was not in song. His character is poorly developed and never does have the impact that he was meant to have. \"Cabaret\" wanted to be trail-blazing, but basically does the same thing that earlier films from the 1960s did. \"The Sound of Music\" is a better musical dealing with the fear generated from the Nazis and \"Midnight Cowboy\" is a better film that deals with the taboo subjects of bi- and homosexuality. \"Cabaret\" is a good film, but it is no \"Godfather\" and the fact that it won eight Oscars is one of those mysteries generated by the Academy. 4 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "\"Cabaret\" sets the tone as one of the best musicals ever adapted to the screen back in the 1970's and is still one of the most exciting heart-pulsing films of all time. To put it blunt, it has everything to please those who are fans of musicals. It provides plenty of wit and charm which is what most would expect in a musical of this calibre. The music is very exciting and enthralling much like the reboot of \"Chicago\". The acting is pitch perfect and also quite phenomenal (Liza Minnelli just totally makes Sally Bowles a character her own). But what makes \"Cabaret\" so extraordinary is that in spite of the light-hearted music and the scintillating singing and dance numbers is that the story itself sparks a lot of deep, dark and at times disturbing undertones to it as well. Such brooding topics lay in the facets of racism, alienation, abortion and other assorted taboos. But the dark tones are brilliantly concealed through the delicate dancing and wonderful singing you wouldn't think that this was a dark story.The musical is adapted from \"The Berlin Stories\" by Christopher Isherwood and centres around a young British tutor named Brian Roberts (Michael York) who has made residence in Berlin in 1930. He lives across the hall from the perky, but eccentric lounge singer and fellow Englander Sally Bowles (Minnelli). She's a singer at the Kit Kat Klub a local Cabaret centre. Once Brian falls in love with her, Sally becomes aggressive and desiring. But their relationship is constantly put to the test as a Baron steps into the fray who also has his eyes on both Sally and even may have lust for Brian as well. As the Nazi party starts to come into full effect, trouble obviously comes with the package not only to the two lovebirds, but for those who are close to them as well.The free-spirited attitude lingers throughout the course of the film and is wisely used as a decoy to symbolize the feelings the film is trying to get across. The humour of the movie stems from making fun Nazism as they demonstrate the modus operandi of what the Nazi party truly represented, whether is was through domination, greed and the bizarre love triangle Sally and Brian are up against.Progressively, the events outside the Klub materialize splendidly equal to the events within the vicinity.What can be said about the acting except that it was absolutely beautiful. Liza Minnelli was an absolute delight. She played her rather complex characters with absolute perfection. Joel Grey was equally electrifying as the Emcee. The exchange in words were spot-on and it also looks and feels very natural to the point that they didn't sound like they were acting. The audience must've felt silent when they were singing songs together like \"Money\" as they played off their every move and even apart they were sublime. In stage number like \"Two Ladies\", Grey uses lots of comedic energy that pays homage to the silent film era performers like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Minnelli is just special and musically enhanced when she rips out the final song you just wish the song never had an ending. Michael York pulls off a great performance as Brian Roberts, but he sadly very upstaged by the domineering performance of Minnelli, she's just has that integrity that she carries with her.Overall, it is safe to say that \"Cabaret\" is an delightful movie that comes across being the musical of all musicals.. Bob Fosse created a brilliant masterpiece, but it was released in bad timing because when it came out, another heavy came into full effect, \"The Godfather.\" If you never seen it yet, you don'y know what you're missing. For those who love high energy films like \"Moulin Rouge\" or \"Chicago\", then this type of movie might be your cup of tea. It will surely leave you awestruck for a very long time.",

(PG)Musical drama, liberally adapted from the Broadway show of the same name, centered primarily on American entertainer, Sally Bowles (Oscar-winner Minnelli), who performs at a Berlin cabaret theatre called the Kit Kat Club during the waning days of the Weimar Republic. Fosse's song-and-dance numbers are dazzlingly staged, blocked, choreographed and edited (\"Mein Herr\" is a mini-masterpiece), and the backdrop rise of the Nazi party establishes a sinister undercurrent throughout, providing many of the movie's most memorably dark and provocative moments. Unfortunately, the dominant storyline focusing on the relationship between Minnelli and York is rarely compelling and lacks emotional resonance; one wishes those scenes would clear out of the way so that the others can take (figurative) center stage--fishnet stockings and Fascists and transvestites, oh my! Only the ominous but flamboyant emcee (fellow Oscar-winner Grey), almost never seen offstage, truly distinguishes himself from the pack.

I say Riefenstahl's Hitler because those murky years culminate with her Triumph; a film staged on the behest of Hitler to 'document' a great new image for German soul, the document all in this being staged to be an identity.So how apt that our film is all about staged images attempting to seduce? And even more apt, a seduction that trivializes and dehumanizes complex life on the other side of that stage.So this should have been a great film, an acidic set of false images for Nixon's America.But glamorous Bob Fosse was clearly not the person for a job that required New Hollywood blood. We get only the sketch. The more we wander off into this world, the more we discover it's all one big set. It's movielike where should be life, formulaic in its dramatic entanglements, for instance the trio of lovers with the rich baron, the unwanted pregnancy, the German gigolo who falls for a young Jew heiress. It trusts the viewer to know how these things will pan out and sacrifices required, that Krystallnacht is only a few years away.So okay, everything's a stage where all the main players have to conceal a part of them from the eyes of a larger audience (homosexuality / ethnicity / love life), except her, an open sexual being - of course an American - who is a cabaret dancer and aspires to act in the movies.Which leaves the actual show. Now the test of a good musical in my eyes is how well it can weave song and dance, as expressions of inner heart, with the world at large that in one or the other way offers the inspiration. How deeply can it visualize impulse that cannot be put to words?Flimsy weave here. We're shown a segment that is about sexual mischief or the sudden swell of nationalism, and then cut to burlesque that lampoons the situation we have just witnessed.It dehumanizes, because where we imagined complicated life, the show hammers home a cardboard satire. There is no heart in the thing, and is consumed by the audience in the same decadent way. So maybe the film posits as root of evil - evil that would go on to sweep Europe in a few years - a society that is ashamed to confront that part it has to keep concealed, and instead prefers the safety of a fabricated cardboard image.That is fine. But we still have a film where she, wounded, liberated, gets out on a stage to sing it doesn't strike any spark, because nothing here has a soul of its own. Fosse gambled on prefab reality and lost any sense of reality.",

That is the best one-word description for this movie, \"Cabaret.\" It garnered a number of awards in 1972, including Best Actress for Minnelli and Best Supporting Actor for Grey (who incidentally is the dad of Jennifer Grey, who was \"Baby\" in dirty dancing.)Liza Minnelli is Sally Bowles, American showgirl and performer in 1931 Germany, about the time that the Nazis were beginning to assert themselves. Included is the early suppression of the Jews. Sally is very flaky, thinks she can become a movie star, but we see that it just isn't going to happen. Michael York is a recent Cambridge graduate Brian Roberts just coming to Germany to work on his doctorate. He ends up renting a room across from Sally's in a big boarding house, but it soon seems like Sally and Brian share both rooms together. Brian is shy and proper, Sally is brassy and bold, he has no choice but to go along with her.Helmut Griem as Maximilian von Heune shows up. He is a wealthy baron who ends up showing Brian and Sally both a good time. They become a love triangle in a most unconventional manner.Joel Grey is Master of Ceremonies at the club, where patrons are told to leave their troubles at the door and only have a good time inside. We never see Grey out of costume, his only contact with the rest of the cast is on-stage or back stage. It is fitting that Sally does the movie's closing number and the last verse says \"Life is a Cabaret, old chums...\" and that is the metaphor in the movie. What we see in small glimpses onstage mirrors what is happening in the lives of those outside in everyday life.I used to sing \"I love a parade, the whole world is a parade\" for a similar reason.Ribald: \u2013adjective 1. vulgar or indecent in speech, language, etc.; coarsely mocking, abusive, or irreverent; scurrilous. \u2013noun 2. a ribald person.",

It's a travesty, and Academy voters usually put into play politics more than actual deserve when making decisions (ie how did SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE beat SAVING PRIVATE RYAN for Best Picture in '99?) I thought the songs were excellent, and I applaud Bob Fosse's choice to exclude all songs (except TOMORROW BELONGS TO ME-which I must say was frightening in its context) that didn't take place in the Kit Kat Club. It always seems unnatural when a character bursts into song cooking dinner or reading a book. The songs themselves were also of top quality, especially WILKOMMEN, CABARET, and MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO 'ROUND. They are executed with energy comparable to a stage production and the arrangements were superb. Fosse's choreography, fast-paced cinematography, and lighting almost transports the viewer to Broadway, combined with the \"stage acting\" method of over-exaggeration of Joel Grey. Liza Minelli was just okay. She never impressed me very much, especially because of her drug habits, and her haircut and makeup were very annoying and distracting. Michael York is not much of an actor and his character would've been better played by Michael Caine or Alec McCowen. Marisa Berenson was good though, too bad she didn't do much else after this besides Kubrick's BARRY LYNDON. Helmut Griem was also pleasant to watch, albeit his part was too small (he is introduced almost an hour into the film and disappears about forty minutes later and never resurfaces).Geoffrey Unsworth's cinematography was excellent, although not as good as Gordon Willis's for THE GODFATHER the same year. As Broadway musicals turned films, this one is just so-so. It lacks the bravura of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF and WEST SIDE STORY but is far superior to THE MUSIC MAN and GIGI. I suppose no Broadway musical can be as good on stage, and this film certainly does nothing to prove this theory wrong.\nIn spite of these negative comments, I found the film to be enjoyable, although it could've been shortened by 20 minutes, and if released only a year later, it would've deserved the Oscars it won, plus Best Picture over THE STING and its director George Roy Hill, but it can't hold a candle to THE GODFATHER. It was pleasant, but nothing great. I rate it at about middle-of-the-road at 5 or 6 out of 10. Highlights: CABARET, WILKOMMEN, MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO 'ROUND, TOMORROW BELONGS TO ME, Kit Kat Club scenes camerawork and choreography, Marisa Berenson, and Helmut Griem.I wouldn't strongly recommend it to anyone except devout Fosse or Minelli fans and musical lovers, but I would suggest watching it if you have nothing else to do.",

            "content": "The late 60s and early 70s were a turning point for the screen musical. Long established as an innocent, chaste genre, it suddenly acquired a raunchy, burlesque quality that brought it back to its \"pre-code\" roots in the early 30s. And this is itself the very era that Cabaret transports us back too \u2013 a bygone age of glamour and sexual liberty that became as much a key for the new generation of musicals as the 1900s had been for those of the previous generation.Like many of the greatest musicals, at the centre of Cabaret is one mesmerising, momentous performance. Liza Minnelli is playful, passionate and ultimately deeply emotive in a turn that would be impressive enough were it purely a dramatic role. But what is more she puts every inch the Sally Bowles character into the way she sings and dances. Constantly beguiling, she seems to build up some mysterious rapport with the audience, beckoning us to come join her in this cabaret of a life. Emerging gradually from the chorus line in the first number, she quickly becomes absolutely riveting.And then we have some top class direction from Bob Fosse. Fosse was originally a choreographer, and more than any other director of musicals he treats cinematic technique as a form of choreography, with whip-pans, focus-shifts and angle-changes all a part of the dance. He was a little heavy-handed in his first feature, Sweet Charity, but here it is all done with such poise and precision that we barely realise how much the image is being manipulated. Fosse also shows himself to be a master of making us see exactly what he wants, for example making sure during one of the numbers that it is only when he reveals himself that we realise one of the dancing girls is actually a dragged-up Joel Grey.But really it is very hard to talk about the individual talents that have gone into Cabaret because this seems so very much a movie in which everyone is working together for the same stylistic aims. I can explain this with the example of just one of the musical numbers \u2013 \"Maybe This Time\". It is, first off, a wonderful Kander and Ebb tune (this is really the only great score they produced). The song of course occurs outside the main line of narrative, but it is nevertheless supposed to be a commentary on the relationship between Liza and Michael York, and Ms Minnelli uses these feelings from the screen romance to inform her performance. The marvellous cinematography of Geoffrey Unsworth shows her at first as a face amid the darkness, eventually throwing a light on her from behind that sends arcs out from her arms and legs as the song swells to a climax. Fosse has his camera slowly wheel about her, giving the impression that she might be singing alone. And when he eventually does show the rest of the club, it's a series of inserts that show this is a rather low-key point in the night, the audience no more than a handful of bored-looking patrons, and suddenly the whole thing has an extra layer of sadness.But there is another strand that winds its way through the movie \u2013 the rising shadow of Nazism. At first it's little more than a bit of historical background detail, seen but not directly commented upon, but eventually Hitler's thugs creep into the story and the songs, taking them over absolutely. One cannot help but speculate, since we know what subsequently happened in Germany, on the eventual fate of Fritz and Natalia, or the various possibly gay characters at the Kit Kat Club. Cabaret finally becomes a dreadfully sinister reminder that this vibrant and liberated society could become horrifically barbaric. At times it is as delightful and joyous as the finest Rodgers and Hammerstein shows, few musicals are quite so effectively chilling.",

She tries to seduce Michael York by showing him the former, but only succeeds when she unwittingly reveals the latter. I still have lots of questions. We never really get a sense of just how much Sally has lived up to this role she's playing, that is, just how sexually experienced is she, and how much is just talk? She only sleeps with two men as far as we know over the course of the movie.I do love the scene when the virgin Natalia seeks romantic advice, and we awkwardly witness just how wrong Sally is for this kind of mentorship, suggesting for example, that maybe Natalia and Fritz can just kind of keep it casual, a concept clearly beyond Natalia's comprehension! Then, just after we've completely fallen in love with Sally, she does this ... thing ... acting out of fear as the prospect of domestic bliss in England is becoming too close to reality, something Sally sees more as a prison than an escape. However you lean politically and ethically about this act, in terms of the movie, it's emotionally devastating, especially since she doesn't even inform York in advance.I'm not entirely sure how we're supposed to feel about Sally after she does it, and I don't know what's going to happen to her as she remains in Berlin just as things are about to get really ugly.",

            "content": "A very stylish look at pre-war Germany.  Dramatic stories are spliced in with music numbers done at a slightly seedy, slightly bawdy cabaret club. The songs and dances are visually fun to look at and have just the right amount of sensuality and theatrics. In many ways they look like an obvious inspiration to the later hit CHICAGO.     Grey is amazing.  He has no speaking lines and yet gives a very unique one of kind performance.  His presence is distinguished and really gives the film it's unique flavor and personality. It's best seen to be really understood.     The stories though between the songs seem awfully trite.  There is nothing really profound or interesting about them.  They tend to just bog the whole thing down.  They also seem to make Germans look uniformly dopey.     Minnelli won the academy award, but it is hard to see why.  Yes she certainly does command the stage when she is singing and dancing, but she seems completely misplaced for the setting.  It's almost like THE STERILE CUCKOO goes to Germany.  Her kookiness and insecurity seems like just more of the same stuff we have already seen from her.  One really can't sympathize with her nor really wants too.  It becomes overdone and seems to push the viewers patience.     Having her paired with refined English teacher York helps...a little. Yet their romance seems hard to believe.  Having this educated, good looking man become jealous every time she talks to another man seems even more unnatural.     Technically it is sound with a good eye for detail.  Yet dramatically it falters.  It's just not strong enough to be anything more than a slight diversion.  The only interesting scene is when a young clean cut teen wearing a Nazi uniform gets up and sings a very impassioned pro German song. It perfectly illustrates visually all the rampant nationalism and brain washing that went on and is both creepy and sad at the same time.",

            "content": "Liza Minnelli became an absolute icon because of her performance in Cabaret, and she finally won the Academy Award she deserved three years prior for The Sterile Cuckoo. While it does appear she's merely being Liza Minnelli, it certainly is an entertaining performance that makes an impression. Perhaps the greatest impression of all is the contrast from the stage musical to the film adaptation. If you've ever seen Cabaret on the stage, you realize how little actual story is present, and how little the actors are actually given to do. It's pretty much one song after another, like Chicago or A Chorus Line. Without cinematic technique and without a great belter with a hugely energetic presence, it's a really lousy show. Liza does have incredible energy that never lets up. From her green fingernails that match her eyeshadow, to her ridiculous but fabulous false eyelashes, her face is always lit up and pumping energy into the audience. Is there a girl out there who hasn't bought a bowler hat and low-cut vest to dress up as Liza for a costume party? She attracts so much attention, audiences almost forget anyone else is even in the movie.Sorry, Michael York. Unfortunately, he wasn't given much to do in the movie except be the \"Nick Carraway\" to Liza's \"Gatsby\". He absorbs his environment and lets the audience absorb through him. Most folks remember Joel Grey, though, since he's all made up and hams up every opportunity as the Emcee. His uncrackable veneer is very entertaining, but I would have loved to have seen Dean Stockwell in the role. I'm sure he would have been just as delightful, and he would have gotten an early comeback in his career.Believe it or not, there are people who don't like this movie - even folks who love musicals! I may rave and sing its praises, but if you have very high standards and think only opera or Stephen Sondheim are acceptable, you might not like this Kander and Ebb musical. The songs don't require grand voices, and they aren't varied in style. However, since the setting of the show is a tired, hole-in-the-wall, cabaret, it makes sense that the songs aren't high quality.To film students, or big fans of the musical genre (of which I am both), Cabaret is a landmark movie. Up until 1972, musicals were filmed in a straight-forward style. The songs provided breaks in the story and the camera never cut away from the action. Yes, The Sound of Music took its choreography for \"Do-Re-Mi\" to new heights, but the song was still performed linearly. Bob Fosse changed all that. In his numbers, the camera cut away from the performers and showed something entirely different (or sometimes related, but in a different locale) that was happening at the same time. As Joel Grey welcomed the audience in \"Wilkhommen,\" Berlin welcomed Michael York's arrival. While two girls wrestled around in the mud onstage for audience amusement, citizens in town were being beaten and arrested by Nazi officers. Also, Fosse chose to cut to camera angles that expanded the setting and gave irony to the song and story. In \"Wilkhommen,\" Joel told the Cabaret audience, \"the girls are beautiful,\" as the editing cut to a shot in the dressing room as a man put on a female wig.Modern audiences have seen Moulin Rouge, Chicago, and Dreamgirls employ this method of cutting away from the musical number, or of continuing the storyline as the song is sung in the background, but few realize Bob Fosse was responsible for our recent delights. It was an innovative idea, and one that truly drummed home the message of Cabaret itself: life has its ups and downs outside the nightclub, but onstage, the same old show must go on. As a member of the board of the Hot Toasty Rag Awards, I voted for Fosse's directing style to take home the newspaper trophy, and I made as compelling arguments as I could. However, I was outvoted by one, and Ronald Neame won Best Director for The Poseidon Adventure. At least the winner was a very good movie with very good special effects.Whether or not you enjoy watching Cabaret, merely appreciate its technicality, or just don't like it, we can all agree on one thing: it immerses you in its setting. You can smell the cigarette smoke absorbed into the entertainers' costumes. The grime and smudges on the mirrors have accumulated for years. Some of the women in the chorus have a day's growth of underarm hair. Every detail crammed into the frame makes you feel like you're there in the nightclub, and it isn't pretty. It's very entertaining, though, so if it's been a few years since you've seen Cabaret, rent it again and see what new things you notice.",

It's risque (especially given the time at which it was released) and it tells a story that is both entertaining and cautionary. The songs, while not the best available versions with the exceptions of Liza Minelli's work, hold up pretty well and are definitely listenable. When it comes to the Master of Ceremonies, the flambuoyant yet oddly intimidating Alan Cumming will always take home the cake for best performance. However, it's Liza that makes this entire film worth the viewing. The gorgeous sets, wonderful audio mixing and quality directing would be nothing were it not for the brilliant performance she gave (a performance that some critics say she was too talented to give). Showing a lot of the star power that guided her mother before her, Liza is a force to be reckoned with in this film, a powerhouse of emotion and vocals the likes of which cannot -- and probably will never -- be topped by anyone who is not a descendent of the great Judy Garland.",

            "content": "Less of an adaptation and more of a total reinvention of the successful stage play, the film version of Cabaret is one of the few movie musicals that is almost universally considered to be superior to the Broadway play that inspired it. Most unusual for the time, director/choreographer Bob Fosse made the ingenious decision to isolate the songs from the dramatic scenes, and keep all of the musical numbers on the stage where they belong. This proves to be a dynamic film-making device, as the terrific songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb create a harrowing juxtaposition to the haunting backdrop of the Nazi party's brutal rise to power in 1930's Berlin. From anti-Semitism and fascism to bisexuality and open promiscuity, there is no subject considered \"off-limits\" in this taboo-bucking motion picture.In an Oscar-winning performance, Liza Minnelli literally radiates with an exuberance that she was never able to recapture elsewhere, and also takes time to belt out bravura renditions of exceptional numbers like \"Mein Herr,\" \"Maybe This Time,\" and, of course, the sublime title song. Englishman Michael York is slender and sexy as Minnelli's occasional love interest, and Joey Grey picked up an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his amusing and creepy performance as the Kit-Kat club's grand emcee. The German-bred actors Helmut Griem and Fritz Wepper both turn in seductive performances, and Jewish socialite Marisa Berenson is quite affecting as the film's sole ing\u00e9nue. Berenson's Berlin accent is so convincing that I mistakenly assumed the New York-born actress was really German for years.Winner of eight Academy Awards in all, including Best Director (the film lost the Best Picture Oscar to THE GODFATHER), CABARET is a remarkable film that successfully combines sexual titillation and wicked humor with grim social commentary and nightmarish realism (sometimes simultaneously and with music). The film is entertaining and enjoyable, but also contains a haunting aura that lingers long after the picture has ended. I have seen this film more than 30 times over the past 25, and I get chills during the \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" sequence every single time. That type of lasting effect is not common in art work of any medium.",

Grey had also won a Tony, as did Prince, for the movie, and Fosse took home the gold.Minnelli plays Sally Bowles, an American singer - that wants to be an actress - of the seedy Kit Kat Klub in pre-World War II Berlin, a city of decadence and immorality shortly before the Nazi Party rises to power. She befriends Brian Roberts (Michael York), a poor British writer who's just come to town, and the two agree to share a flat. She's lonely, but their relationship is platonic, at least at first.

            "content": "\"Divine decadence, darling,\" is what is served up abundantly in *Cabaret*. I was in junior high school when Liza won Best Actress for her tour de force as Sally Bowles \u0096 I was furious because I felt that Diana Ross got robbed. I knew, with my consummate adolescent insight, that Liza was merely playing herself in *Cabaret*, but that Diana was acting her little heart out in *Lady Sings The Blues*. Time has told a different tale, however, with *Lady Sings The Blues* being resigned to ignominy and *Cabaret* remaining as a sparkling achievement in movie-making. Winning 8 Academy Awards in a very tight race against such blockbusters as *The Godfather*, *Deliverance*, and *Sounder*, it is Liza Minelli's tour de force, a role of a lifetime. Even her mother, Judy Garland, never had a role like this, so exquisitely tailored to her talents, that even Liza herself had a tough time topping this performance. In fact, she never did, starring in some truly dismal choices such as *Lucky Lady* and *New York, New York*. In *Cabaret*, Minelli plays Sally Bowles, a plucky little trollop who sings at the Kit Kat club in Berlin, during the time of the Weimar Republic. Sally tries very hard to be \"an international woman of mystery,\" but lives in a dream world in which her non-existent worldly and dashing father will soon swoop down and rescue her. She falls in love with Brian (York), a charming and bi-sexual scholar earning his living as a translator. They are both romanced by a wealthy and handsome suitor (Griem), who after stirring their dreams and passions, leaves them flat. The subplots of Brian's students, their fellow boarders at the rooming house, and Sally's various schemes provide an opportunity for wonderful music and staging. Most of the numbers happen onstage at the Kit Kat club. We have addressed the issue of performances within performances before \u0096 and the usual question is \"Who would pay money to see this?\" But in *Cabaret*, the staged musical numbers are spectacular and you would definitely pay good money to see a nightclub performances like those. \"Money\" and \"Mien Herr\" are incredible, and Bob Fosse's outre choreography is stunning. The costuming and makeup add to the heightened surrealism, and the Nazi threat adds an element of danger and desperation to a movie that would be hard to classify as a musical, drama, comedy, satire or war movie. The Nazi violence, with a few exceptions, is shown by implication and suggestion. The \"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\" number is roundly described as stunning and chilling, and after almost 30 years, remains so. The concept of the story itself is enduring, engendering 90s Broadway revival directed by *American Beauty*'s Sam Mendez",

The focus of the film is on an interesting relationship between two opposites. Brian is a young newly arrived English teacher and Sally a cabaret performance artist. Brian seems touchingly innocent and uncorrupted, while Sally is the lively opportunist, who's not unwilling to sleep with producers in hope of a film career. Sally is a bit naive in a very lovable way.We also get to follow the story of Fritz and Natalia, the gold-digger looking for a rich marriage and the daughter of a rich Jewish merchantman, and their difficult relationship. The Master of Ceremonies and Maximilian, a wealthy aristocrat, both illustrate a nonchalant and immoral life-style. I can't help to be charmed by the elegant self-confidence and \"divine decadence\" of these two characters. I guess decadence is seen as a stylish virtue in Western jet-set culture. Any film with such ingredients and cast could be great, but Cabaret is however also a musical. The songs and performances support the storyline perfectly. Unlike in other musicals the songs seem like a very natural part of the story. The most memorable scene is when a youngster stands up and sings a patriotic song. Soon the viewer gets to see the swastika on his left arm and the audience stands up one after one and sings with him. The scene gives you cold shivers, because the emotional impact is quite scary. The scene makes you wonder what your own reaction would have been and helps to understand how vulnerable people are. Most other songs are great too. \"If you could see her\" (through my eyes) is both heartbreaking and hilarious. Is it a crime to fall in love? Few films I've seen involve as much depth and many different levels as Cabaret. The film is very entertaining, but also realistic, analytical and critical. My all-time favorite.",

The Godfather is an absolute joy to watch, and it's damn near impossible to find fault with it.  Cabaret is torture from title to credits, and I don't think I have the energy to detail all the things wrong with it.But I will start with the biggest: Liza Minelli.  Just goes to show you how good of an actor Michael York is to pretend to be in love with her (though she was the looker in her youth).  The mascara alone in the movie is enough to scare away lesser men.  She's ridiculously annoying in the role, and distracted from everything -- EVERYTHING -- else in the movie. If she weren't so concerned with being her mother, which she's never going to be, she might have been able to stop hamming it up for a bit.As for the film itself...maybe I was just watching a bad transfer, but I've seen copies of old home movies that look like they've been filmed on better quality material.  The story's better told in the play version anyway.  All in all it's just an awful, awful film.

Life is a Cabaret to Sally, Brian and company.  Knowing we're all players, the protagonists that populate this movie dashingly treat life as a cabaret. What the hell, if we're on stage, let's have some fun, eh?  Sally worries she is not shocking enough.  Brian worries he is too shocking.  The energetic, epicene, outre', omniscient Master of Ceremonies serves up appropriate commentary for every situation in the lives of the players, dishing out obiter dictum via the Kit Kat Club stage.  A great number of societal references can be inferred from the Kit Kat Club's numbers, not only the obvious one portrayed, the Weimar Republic's failure to stand up to the looming evil of fascism, but you can feel shades of reference to the American civil rights struggles of the 60s, the human choice of escapism in the face of adversity, and also the classic search for self-acceptance that each faces. All this in a Cabaret, you ask?  You bet.  As the players rocket through the comedy of life and all its tragicomic turns, their better angels do prevail in the parting.  One lesson they learned being, sometimes you just have to be yourself, and let others be themselves, and that painful recognition is the greatest act of acceptance (and love?) that one can make (Sally and Brian's taking leave of each other).  The film comes across as well or better than the stage version.  Fosse, Allen, and Wheeler sagely selected the right subplots from the Isherwood stories, and Fosse earned a direction Oscar (over Coppola!) for his focus.  Cabaret won eight Oscars, a bizarre record in that it's the most Oscars won by a film that didn't win Best Picture (it lost to 'The Godfather').

The musical numbers, which are confined to a nightclub, are excellent, brimming with energy. Most of the film, however, is devoted to the vapid love life of Minnelli and York, and it is not very interesting. Minnelli performs with gusto, but she and York have no chemistry and their relationship is not believable. They become the best of friends hours after meeting. While Fosse gets credit for the musical numbers, what was the Academy thinking in giving him the Best Director Oscar over Francis Ford Coppola for \"The Godfather?\"",

            "content": "I think that I am in love of Cabaret's idea more than the actual movie. It is a bit slow, but it is otherwise a great movie and a very clever film. I absolutely enjoyed the musical numbers and the songs in general. But, I was not really enthralled by the plot. On one hand, the story is very serviceable and you're just waiting for the next musical number to arrive. On the other hand, the brilliance of the musical numbers is rather relative and there is less texture compared to the plot.This movie is actually the story of the rise of fascism in Germany, disguised as a love story, disguised as a musical. It's the type of subtle storytelling that I am very fond of. It does an excellent job of not only arguing and explaining the phenomenon, but also showing it. At first you only see brown shirts in the background of the background. Then you start to see the violence and the tensions in public. And of course, you're in full Nazified Germany by the end. It is well done because it does it indirectly. You see the disinformation campaign, the violent bullying, but also the confidence of the elite that they' will be able to control it.A small regret in that regard, is that despite showing all this, you get the feeling that you're missing the core of the Weimar Berlin's underground cabaret ambiance, and with it the antagonism with Nazis. For all the suggested debauchery and trangressiveness the movie feels somewhat tame. It is not to say that the movie is prude but there is not anything shocking or subversive in the true sense of the word. I kept thinking of Victor, Victoria, which despite being more safe and wholesome, actually has a bit more edge towards sexuality and sexual identity. Here Weimar Berlin, and maybe it was spicy enough for the time, feels kind of bland now. Most of the colourfulness of the film comes from the musical cutaways.The musicals are truly where the film shines. They all take place in the titular cabaret and are just so inventive and funny and cool. Joey Grey completely deserves his award for this movie, as his performance is amazing. I loved every minute of it, and I wished the film spent more time in the actual cabaret. Yet, what is great is that, unlike in other musicals, the songs convey the characters emotions implicitly rather than explicitly. Each numbers theme reflects on the plot, but on a twisted way. In Mein Herr, Sally abandons her lover, while in the film she starts courting Brian. There is the song Two Ladies, but in reality it's two men and one woman. It's, no pun intended, a bit queer. Every cabaret number is closer in spirit to that Weimar-German-Expressionism-Esprit than anything else in the film. That being said, the numbers all take place in the same spot and are done by the same performers. It can feel a bit dry and repetitive. It is a celebration of that specific art form but it not necessarily grandiose spectacle.All in all, this film works because it subverts a lot of tropes and expected devices from movie musicals. Moreover and it does not merely redo the musical in movie form as so much movie-musicals tend to do; but it adapts the material genuinely. This is a good standalone movie, with great musical performances in it. Also, the German accents are spot on.",

            "content": "The man beat out Francis Ford Coppolla. Yes, Bob Fosse, most known for his work on Broadway in regards to dance, beat out Coppolla and \"The Godfather\" for the Oscar for best director in 1973. That has to mean something and upon watching this film, it definitely does. Fosse has captured the off-beat underground of the Cabaret and paralleled it beautifully to Germany at the time of the rise of the Nazi regime.\"Cabaret\" tells the story of Sally (Liza Minnelli) an American trying to make it beg in Berlin by working at the Kit Kat Club and sleeping with all the right people (at least she believes) so that she might one day be a film star. She meets Brian, who is trying to make a living teaching English in Germany and the two hit it off in a very awkward way and their lives are spun into a crazy sexual chaos because what is practical and what is instinctive don't line up. This effects all characters in the film in some way. Of course, sprinkled throughout are scenes and numbers from the Kit Kat Club, where the master of ceremonies (Joel Grey) is sure to put on a lively and raunchy show each night.The brilliance is that the viewer, much like the audience is being entertained so that they can lighten up and forget about the difficult times. For the viewer, that is the drama of the film and for the audience that is the rise of the Nazis. Joel Grey's role is therefore ever so pivotal to keep you amused and he is simply commanding in his Oscar-winning role. Minnelli is also strong in that she embodies both sides of life: the amusing and the difficult.Fosse contributes to this with various effects, one being the distorted mirrors image that he uses both in the beginning and the end and the other more apparently so in the way he stages and shows the musical numbers at the cabaret. Grey and the dancers are raunchy and strange, yet captivating, and despite the fact that these women are not attractive and alluring, you're still very entertained by the whole show. It's the very reason this film is successful, otherwise it would be boring. It already feels too long for a musical at 2 hours where the drama is most exclusively between Brian, Sally and their friend Maximillion.The impact of the Nazis is not really felt in this film because most of the conflict is superficial in nature between Brian and Sally (their problems can't compete with the problems of Germany and the Nazis at the time) and this was probably the only thing keeping \"Cabaret\" from topping \"The Godfather\" for best picture.",

Immediately upon its release in 1972 it transcended the already lofty position that film held in the public realm, and ascended to the heights of \"International Phenomenon.\" It swept the world pop culture before anyone had yet heard the term \"Blockbuster,\" fully deserving of every iota of praise and admiration that was lavished upon it. Never aware of it as a contrived, artificial Hollywood product, I was completely absorbed, totally immersed in a remarkably profound experience. I'm no fan of Pollyanna musicals or Broadway schmaltz, and thankfully, neither is Bob Fosse. The intensely heady atmosphere of the Kit Kat Club is palpable, as is the increasingly ominous threat of the rising Nazi party. All the elements - music, lyrics, dialog, character, costume, decor, setting, pace - are entirely supportive of its somber theme. Inside the club, Life is beautiful, and the music, singing and dancing are brash, bawdy and brilliant. The contrast of life inside and outside the club is not just an effective device to make logical and believable the normally quaint and awkward Musical Movie form, but is also a powerful metaphor for our ability and willingness to distract and delude ourselves. So much of the world, at the time the story takes place, refused to see just exactly how black was the storm gathering on the horizon, and Fosse is keen to comment on this tragic aspect of human nature. As outrageous and raucous and delightful as Cabaret works to be, it's always grounded in stark, stern reality. This exceptional balancing of such paradoxical, contradictory impulses is such a rare quality in popular films, and is almost as scarce in the population that consumes them. This film was unusual, too, in its unfashionably frank depiction of \"alternative\" lifestyles. In 1972 many were deeply shocked, but so many more were thoroughly charmed; the irresistible allure of it's character's genuine wide-eyed wonder and optimism amidst such gritty truth is so powerfully persuasive.Liza Minnelli brings so much natural spunk and pathos to her captivating portrayal of the the desperately naive Sally Bowles. Her innate ability at maneuvering Sally's roller coaster emotional path demands our attention. Most every other character is superbly rendered as a near comical silhouette, and Bob masterfully provides key moments for them to magically blossom into fully three dimensional personalities; the wonderful effect wholly dependent on superior acting talent. Some people who are aficionados of the original Broadway production may balk at the curtailed musical score, or some of the artistic liberties that Bob took with Christopher Isherwood's 'Berlin Stories,' but these edits are all in the service of a sublimely powerful cinematic experience. If you need to see the Broadway version, go find the Broadway version. And, if you can turn this one off before the end credits then you urgently need a checkup from the neck up.",

I do not agree that this film was worthy of the Oscars it garnered in 1972, nor that Fosse's direction was superior to Francis Ford Coppolla's with \"The Godfather\"; but it is nonetheless a worthy movie for those who enjoy period pieces or musicals. \"Cabaret\" is decent as a musical, featuring songs equal to those in such notable screen classics as \"The Music Man\" and \"My Fair Lady.\" Minnelli is delectable as Sally Bowles, and her acting is equal to her singing; eerily enough, her voice is almost identical to her mother's. The emcee is my favorite character in the film; his song numbers serve the same role as a Greek chorus with regards to the main plot.I recommend this film mostly to those who have a fondness for musicals.

            "content": "There is an unwritten rule in musicals and specifically movie musicals. They have to be decadent. Especially in modern times everything from the themes to the set pieces have to be elaborate, abundant, clean, shiny and new; and why the heck not? No one really breaks out into song with a mood forming Greek chorus bellowing behind them. It only makes sense that if you're going to be creating your own reality in song; you might as well go for broke.Cabaret starts in the Berlin Kit Kat Club during the waning years of the Weimar Republic. Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) works and performs there clinging to a dream of discovery and eventual stardom. The Emcee (Joel Grey) invites us, the audience into her world where the attitudes towards booze and prurient pleasures are as loose as the women. In comes Brian (Michael York) an uptight British writer who is working towards his doctorate in Germany. He pays for his schooling and boardinghouse boudoir by teaching eager German heirs and heiresses English. The two meet as Brian is moving in and start a friendship that might just become a little something more.Cabaret is the granddaddy of modern movie musicals for very good reason. In addition to being topical and intricate, it's also does decadence with originality and spontaneity. How odd then that the film isn't strictly speaking a musical. The music is diegetic furthering the story largely through Joel Grey's character. The songs inject the film's themes with a macabre sense of humor yet no character sings who isn't already doing it for a living. What results is a world very much its own entity yet functioning within an increasingly hostile reality.There is also a subplot about two of Brian's pupils falling in love and marrying in an unabashed Jewish ceremony yet the principle story revolves around Sally and Brian's unconventional romance. Themes like poverty, the rise of Nazism, homosexuality, poly-amorous love and freedom of artistic expression all run amok creating a sense of frenzied fatalism. Yet that fatalism is choreographed with panache and seduction that is impossible to resist.If there are any noted faults in Cabaret they stem from director Bob Fosse. He may have won the Academy Award for Best Direction, beating out Francis Ford Coppola and The Godfather (1972) but I couldn't help but feeling slighted by his hawkeyed style. Fosse he makes the mistake of keeping the camera at mid-range one too many times. It parades by the sidelines of the Kit Kat Club stage but never meanders on stage for too long. Fosse should have taken some cues from famed director and choreographer Busby Berkeley, making the camera a participant in the choreography. You compare the famed \"Life is a Cabaret\" to \"By a Waterfall\" from Footlight Parade (1933) and you'll see what I mean.Still you got to give Cabaret credit for ushering in a new generation of American musicals; a generation more jaded and cynical yet still looking for a good time. Without Cabaret there would have been no Sweeney Todd (2007), Hairspray (2007) or Chicago (2002), which incidentally Fosse directed for the stage. Provocative, sensual and surprisingly relevant, Cabaret deserves it's stature as a gold standard for musicals.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",

The world of pre-WWII Berlin is seen through the distorted mirror of the Kit Kat Night Club. While technically a musical, the movie does not use the contrivance of having people stop in the middle of a scene and burst out in song and dance. Rather, the songs and danges are integrated into the plot either by being performed on the Cabaret stage or in some other natural manner--including the bone-chilling Tomorrow Belongs to Me.  Unlike most movies of the time (including the vastly overrated Godfather), director Bob Fosse does not keep the action entirely linear; rather event A will happen in scene 1, you then have scene 2 dealing with an unrelated issue, then the consequence of event A will be played out in scene 3.  This lets the viewer draw his own connections, rather than having everything spoon-fed by the moviemaker. While the Godfather un-deservedly got Best Picture for 1973, it got a total of only 3 Oscars, while Cabaret got 8 (including Best Director)--making it the movie to have gotten the most Oscars without also getting Best Picture.

Only the music and decadence of the Kit Kat Club. Joel Gray as the MC is haunting. Liza Minnelli as Sally Bowles is riveting and gives the musical performance of her career. When the music stops, the movie is hollow. Sally is a foreigner in Germany. She has few friends and passes the time with fornication and drink between musical acts. She is in a \"love triangle\" with two men. One may be bi-sexual. She gets pregnant and has an abortion. We are shown searing images of the coming fall of Germany. A man is beat to death in the alley. A German youth sings the praises of Hitler. Jews looking truly terrified in the marketplace. Innocent German children who know nothing about the nightmare to come. Most depressing, and intended to be so. Long, inane, boring dialog that goes on forever.

The characterizations other than Liza as Sally are uniformly flat. Michael York is incredibly boring and the same could be said for the rest of the supporting cast. The two German actors and the beautiful though dull Marisa Berenson. Therein lies my problem with the movie. It's worth a look, the musical numbers are great but the plot somehow meanders, and is only of real interest because of the looming Nazi undertones. As for Liza, well, you either find her annoying or cute or perhaps annoyingly cute. The one truly magnificent element in the movie other than the musical numbers is the classic performance of Joel Grey as the emcee. For that the movie is worth seeing but unfortunately the rest of the cast Liza exempted (sort of) are not up to par.",

The costuming and choreography is absolutely INSANE and the musical numbers foreshadowing events is just MWAH!! Wow!! It is unusual that a movie of this era would have TWO bisexual men that are both perfectly lovely and protagonists. I think the entire problem with Sally and them could have been fixed with a poly relationship to be honest that would have been nice. But Joel grey as the emcee was one of the most bananas incredible castings ever good grief. It is fun and whimsical but also very real and very haunting and the combined early 30s and early 70s aesthetics are delicious. It is the perfect combo of fun and impending doom that you would expect out of late Weimar Berlin <3. I truly adore this movie I think I will watch it again soon the emotions are a bit indescribable with this one.",

There are no great dance numbers or songs. The music and choreography is in no way contemporary to 1970, instead it reflects the era which the film takes place and is exactly what you'd expect to see in a cabaret in early 1930's Berlin. Contrast this with a musical like Chicago where the music and dancing is more contemporary with just a touch of 1920's Chicago. Many interesting characters against a backdrop of the rise of the Nazi Party but it simply doesn't pull together into a cohesive story so much as it is a character study. That said, the characters are, at least, interesting. I loved Liza Minnelli in this, she gave a memorable performance as a helplessly hopeful, happy-go-lucky, whimsical starry-eyed dreamer. She absolutely deserved her Oscar. I was truly shocked at who won Best Actor, though, I mean you've got to be kidding me.",

Life is a cabaret my chum, come to the cabaret\" which of course is the heart of the glitter covered, sequin wearing, toe tapping wonder emporium that is the Kit Kat Klub, packed up to the rafters with high notes, transvestites and raucous laughter. Between the choices of all that and my room, I know I would rather be on a Saturday night, because 1932 Germany is the place to be! But I warn you to get there fast, because what is waiting on the horizon will defiantly ruin the party. Oh forgot my manners, allow me to introduce to you Miss Salley Bowles (Liza Minnelli), husband richest man in the world and of course a future acting superstar, a creature of true divine decadence as she would better put it. At a glance her eyes may be full of youthful exuberance and naivety, but when you look deeper, you realize it's all just a ploy, a false bravado to keep her fragile spirits from being damaged. But the only person who knows this is also a person you would describe as the exact opposite, Brain (Michael York) who is a uptight, straight laced, bisexual Englishman, the absolute antithesis of everything that is Sally. Yet the signs of a beautiful romance begins to blossom between them. But life is never that easy, because the malicious Nazi party waits around the corner and a love triangle with Maximilain threatens to thrust the romance into inescapable turmoil. The 1972 Academy Awards was the battlefield of two almighty giants that waged war against each other for the rights of their place on the cinematic throne for that year. The battle was of course won by Godfather when it took home Best Picture, but with a mammoth total of 8 Oscar nodes, including a Best director for Bob Fosse and best actress for Minnelli, I doubt Cabaret will be feeling to down after the event. You realize why Cabaret did so well with each repeat viewing gives you something completely different; may it be songs for yours next karaoke night, a celebration of weird quirks or must importantly a chance to awe at Minnelli's delightful performance as Salley all over again. I would be the first to admit I was nether much of a fan of musicals, I found them to be plot less, lacking in any character depth and just generally derivative. So film like Chicago, Moulin Rouge and high school music's never really appealed to me, I just shudder at the thought of being in a world where people would randomly start breaking out in song and dance for no real apparent reason. But then I saw Cabaret, I wouldn't even say it's entirely a music, it more a film with musical numbers in it and certainly not derivative on contrary it's multilayered and brimming with subversive themes that are as relevant to 1932 Germany, right into 1972 America and forward to worldwide today.",

In my humble opinion, \"Cabaret\" is just a touch ahead of \"The Godfather\". Certainly, 1972 must have been a lucky year with two top-shelf movies competing for the best picture award, both being considered as masterpieces even 30 years later. And \"The Godfather\" certainly is part of cinema history, beyond any doubt: together with its follow-ups it is a landmark of epic story-telling, it has brilliant actors, it has Gordon Willis's excellent cinematography, very strong editing, too, and it has made an enormous impact on a whole film genre.However, \"Cabaret\" strikes me as something completely different, and something which is far harder to achieve than \"The Godfather\". It is a musical, yet it isn't, it most skilfully (!) conveys feelings and a message that go far beyond the pure storyline (even though it is also a very entertaining film even for the low-brow viewer). It has excellent performances, too (especially by its supporting cast), and it has aged very well (something that cannot be said of most of the films of the early 70s).Personally, I think the difference between \"The Godfather\" and \"Cabaret\" is somewhat like the difference between perfect craftsmanship - and very good craftsmanship with a touch of genius, on the other hand.Now you decide what is more impressive.",

The film fails I think mostly because it never has any real concentration on anything. I wanders around looking for something to focus in on, or a plot. It has several other flaws that come from the big one like the fact that they never bother to create any character development, or to give us any good dialogue. Cabaret misses out in so many big places that even the many small ones it gets right can't bring it back to life, making it of course fail, but not horribly.",

It's recommended viewing for anyone with a brain and is an object lesson in how to make a great film without spending hundreds of millions of dollars. So what's wrong? Most of what's been written about Minelli's performance is true and the Oscar was fully deserved but there are a few moments that seem badly disconnected.

It's still a wonderful film but you can't help thinking that a tweak here and a tweak there could have made it better. There is however one thing which is perfect.

            "content": "Back in the day, Bob Fosse's second feature was drown with praises and awards -- eight Oscars and three Golden Globes. It was a big hit and is still today considered as one of the finest musicals ever made. It has succeed to record images to our consciousness regarding what life was like in the Weimar Republic, right before the rise of NSDAP. Even though I am not a big fan of American musicals, Cabaret must be acknowledged among the finest, alongside with The Sound of Music (1965), of its era. Cabaret is a film with its flaws but, what is most interesting in it, is its historical period picture.The film begins with a mirror view of a cabaret; and the viewer is instantly invited to the world of joy and oblivion -- \"Leave your troubles outside, life is disappointing, forget it!\" In fact, Cabaret is a mirror reflection; a reflection of a world at transition; Europe on the eve of the rise of Nazism. Soon the story is introduced to us: an American club dancer (Liza Minelli) entertains crowds in Berlin at the beginning of the 30's and starts a love affair with two men. The story is rather thin and intelligently simplistic but, to my mind, the most intriguing thing is how this story line reflects the gloomy morale of the Nazis.First of all, the central milieu is a cabaret and the songs sung there are perfectly tied to the film: \"money makes the world go around,\" \"life is a cabaret,\" \"two ladies and one man,\" \"if you could only see her with my eyes.\" The latter, which portrays a man and a monkey in love, is, in all its tackiness, funny and naively simplistic. In fact, here lies the biggest flaw of the movie. In its structure and how, at times, it is extremely self-evident, even banal in its metaphorical nature, if I may say so.However, the grotesqueness of the film is both delightful and horrible (the montage of a show and a violent act performed by the Nazis, for instance). In the light of this, we see how Cabaret deals with friendship and love, happiness and freedom but also, paradoxically; portrays a decadent world where all of these have turned upside down: into malignancy and violence, oppression and anxiety, which have taken over.An essential observation is that the grotesque eroticism of the cabaret, in fact, equals the decadent morale of the Nazis. Due to this, I am mainly fascinated by the film's historical context and how it is also a picture of the 70's; how it has drawn the relation between the past and the presence: the burlesque -- the disco, gay culture, civil rights and the feminist liberalization.In the end, we return to the beginning; to the reality -- \"Didn't you forget all about your troubles? -- and we see the mirror view once again, through a tracking shot. The camera stops by an elusive reflection, an illusion from which we cannot distinguish anything but the faceless Nazi officers. This awakes a strong thought of Cabaret as a \"metamusical\" for it truly achieves to describe how transient happiness is, in the middle of chaos, suffering and destruction.",

The musical itself was adapted from a novel and played on Broadway(NYC, US) and West End (London, UK) from 1966 to 1969. Liza was a real nightclub singer and although she carries the role and act well, she is like the character she plays, a better singer than actress. \"Maybe This Time\" is the best song for melody, lyrics and performance, but \"Money\" with Minnelli and Joel Grey also delivers. They would both win an acting Oscar for their role. Joel Grey is also delightful in \"Two Ladies\" with another funny choreography and fitting art direction. Director Bob Fosse, along with cinematographer, editor, sound, score and art direction won awards and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture and Screenplay but lost to The Godfather (1972) which was better in both aspects. Its 8 wins are the most ever won for a movie that did not win Best Picture.The directing succeeds in a few scenes, including the disarray of the German woman, Natalia Landauer (played by Marisa Berenson) who has been ravished and feels lust and love- She asks advise and confess to promiscuous Sally in probably the best non musical scene.The rest of the movie carries through nicely and neatly but with less flair. Cinematography does shine on occasion with some swift visuals. Colours, movements, feelings in either interior or exterior shots.A nice musical that could have benefited from slightly better source material but that transit to the screen effectively and also deals with the slow and innocuous rise of the Nazi in the background.Flirty, full of life and rich beyond its minor imperfections.",

However, I do prefer the stage version of \"Cabaret,\" due to the many subplots (i.e. the Fraulein Schneider/Herr Schultz relationship) that do not appear in the film. People who are unfamiliar with the musical or the story should see the film first, and then the play (I've seen the current revival 16 times to date); the experience is much more harrowing when you are actually there witnessing everything. But like I said before, the movie is brilliant, and even more brilliant when not compared to the stage version. I know I already mentioned Liza, but you cannot say enough about her here. She is magnificent, as are Joel Gray (as the Master of Ceremonies) and Michael York (as Brian). The choreography is another stand-out. \"Mein Herr,\" is Fosse at his best. Everything in the film is so real, it almost feels like a documentary. My only complaint is that the film can feel heavy at times. This heaviness is nowhere to be found in the stage version (which was directed by \"American Beauty\" genius Sam Mendes). Fans of the movie should definitely see the play - Broadway's Susan Egan singing the title song is the most intense theatrical experience I've ever witnessed, not to take anything away from Liza.

She was thought to be a great singer due to her being the daughter of Judy Garland -- an infinitely more varied and complex singer.This film made Michael York a sex symbol -- note his resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio during the film -- the boyish, vaguely homosexual face, slim body.",

One notable thing about this movie, as a musical, is that all of the singing and dancing takes place on the stage of the Kit Kat Club (the cabaret).  There is no singing mixed with the dialogue.  Liza Minnelli's perfomance as Sally Bowles is charming.  I really liked it when she performed \"Mein Herr\"; that's my favorite scene in the movie.  Plus, the cinematography and editing are outstanding.  Best of all, there's actually a story in this movie--it's not just a musical for the sake of being one.

It absolutely knocked me out in 1972 when I was a 12 year old boy in Tennessee. I had never seen anything like it. Ran out to buy the soundtrack, saw it again multiple times, raved about it to anyone who would listen, etc. etc. I became an instant Liza Minnelli fanatic, and I had NEVER had any interest in her. Had to see all her old stuff. Barely knew she was Judy's daughter. Frankly, I was a fan of Liza before I was a fan of Judy's. Saw \"Cabaret\" many times over the years, and just recently, it was revived here in NYC at a benefit screening, attended by Liza, Kander and Ebb, Marisa Berenson, and other people associated with the film. I will tell you that you could hear a pin drop in the audience as the lights went down. It was like being in church. \"Cabaret\" has lost NONE of it power since 1972; it is better than ever. The standing ovation at the end was sustained and LOUD. It is a crime that \"Cabaret\" is not on the AFI Top 100 list, and a result of that, that list has absolutely no relevance to me. (BTW, where is it on the IMDB top 250? It used to be there.) Anyway, if you haven't seen it, you're in for a revelatory experience. It is one of a kind.

After I watched this film last night, I had a change of heart because I gave myself the opportunity to analyze the characters.The leading characters have no redeeming qualities, while the supporting cast added a silver lining. More on this later.Liza Minnelli's dancing and singing are on point and were delightful to watch. Cabaret inspired a slew of imitators. It is easy to see where many dancing female pop stars got their moves and act from. Bob Fosse and Liza Minnelli deserve a lot of credit for their body of work.Onto the negative aspects of the film. Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) is a walking stereotype of a cabaret act and veers on being caricature. She is so desperate, vapid, needy, promiscuous and is not a lot of fun to be with outside of the cabaret and parties. Ms. Bowles has unresolved daddy issues that contribute more to her personal failures more than she acknowledged. Brian Roberts (Michael York) starts out as a fly on the wall who has plenty of wiles of his own. He seems conflicted about his sexual orientation. He knows that he may be gay, but had a few affairs with women knowing that he went against himself. Mr. Roberts is resolute about social issues (e.g. growing Nazism and anti-Semitism), and this is where he shows his might. The film is much more sympathetic to Brian than Sally. We never get to see how Sally was affected by the growing right wing movement in Germany. Instead, she is depicted as too much of a superficial escapist to even care, which is worse. Brian's character gets to show all of his facets, not just his sexual and fun-loving side.Cabaret's brighter spots is the Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey). Under the guise of humor, he tells the truth. He is the quintessential court jester of Shakespearean times. The MC keeps the movie from turning soppy and unfocused. His mischievous appearance only adds more to the fascination. Grey's work cannot be underestimated.Fritz (Fritz Wepper) is pretty one dimensional, but because the film addresses anti-Semitism, his presence gives the film a greater heart. His relationship with Natalia (Marisa Berenson) is a big turning point for each other as Nazis take hold of Germany. When one contrasts Natalia with Sally, we the quintessential virgin-whore dichotomy that is as old as dirt. Natalia is \"good\" because she is virginal, sweet, conventional and cultured. Sally is \"bad\" because she is loose, dirty, vulgar and overly sexed. These women do not intersect. In fact, Natalia's critical of Sally's overt sexual expression.Baron Maximilian von Heune's (Helmut Griem) presence introduced another facet of Brian's personality. He has a price just like Sally and can be a rent boy under the right circumstances. Fancy items like cashmere sweaters and gold cigarette cases come with a price. However, the film treats Max and Brian's affair much more subduedly and respectfully than Sally.In the end, Cabaret did not leave me happy, with the exception of Fritz and Natalia's marriage. Overall, it was not a feel-good movie, despite the cheerful dancing.",

Bob Fosse actually is a very good filmmaker. I often wonder what would have happened if he had picked that line of work. Here he picked an excellent cast to portray the end of an era, a group which decided to hold on until the end, bent on ignoring the world around them and party on. As we all do in our own way. Of course this will end badly, for life usually does.Back when I was stuck in officer's school, this was one of the only watchable films shown in the city where I was stationed.

Minelli's performance is incredible but overpowering, and I'm relieved when she's off screen. The affair between Brian and Sally is a bit of a strain as well, but only because it is frustrating and slightly unbelievable. Minelli, to her credit, makes her character's ambivalence obvious, but York, though a good actor, plays it too straight, showing neither the reasonable doubt nor the required level of intentional denial (especially for a character who, for a bookish Cambridge student, is both remarkably perceptive of Sally's playacting and bold in his contempt of Nazism) necessary to make us believe that he's as caught up in this faux romance as the script requires him to be. There are other flaws as well. The music strains believability, as it is obviously scored for and played by a much larger ensemble than the one shown on screen. Unlike most others, I found the \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" sequence to be beautifully shot and edited but embarrassingly obvious. It's as if someone thought that the film had better make it clear to the densest of viewers that Nazis Are A Bad Thing. Finally, the VHS I saw was cropped, worn, and badly transfered; DVD viewing seems mandatory.Little of this matters in the end, though, as _Cabaret_ is so bold, well-structured, well-performed, and arresting that the flaws fade quickly from memory. Even on the awful print I saw the lighting is incredible and the editing exciting, and Minelli's over-the-top musical performance beats doubts into submission faster than a bunch of Brown Shirts after a night of elbow-bending. Fosse is equally overpowering: never a subtle director (which is usually to his credit), but always a subtle choreographer. The image of the blank faced \"Cabaret Girls\", swinging their out-thrust pelvises back and forth in doubletime while staring dead-eyed at the audience, sets the chill of the movie in the first five minutes, and that chill never leaves. Joel Grey, as the evil MC, threatens that the girls may take off their clothes; if they did, it would be like a striptease of corpsesSee it on DVD, and don't turn off your brain.

The lyrics are very imaginative and funny, and sad when they have to be. One magnificent thing about some songs is that you can feel different about them (sad, happy...) each time you see the movie. That IS something.The acting couldn\u00b4t be better. Of course, Judy\u00b4s daughter steals the show with the breathtaking performance of the funny, crazy and childish Sally Bowes. She was born to play Sally, but she didn\u00b4t perform, she BECAME Sally. Joel Grey was also amazing. The rest of the cast is not as brilliant, but it\u00b4s quite good, specially Faye Dunaway.The script. Well, it\u00b4s probably the best thing of the picture. It takes you through the life of an ordinary girl living an ordinary life singing at the Kit Kat Club, a Cabaret in the Berlin of 1931. Sally\u00b4s character is so familiar and simple that you could expect to find her walking in the street tomorrow. It\u00b4s just great. The movie is about everything that might seem love without getting to be love. Sexual affairs (heterosexual and homosexual), sensuality, etc... That\u00b4s great about the movie.Well, what else? The cinematography is very good, it\u00b4s dark, and siniester for such a creepy and dangerous world Sally lives in without realizing. GREAT. GREAT.Directing. Bob Fosse does a great job, even though it was only the second film he directed. Nothing was wrong, there were no mistakes. A masterpiece.After saying this, the movie would deserve a rate of 9/10.

            "review_title": "The most brilliant film musical ever",
            "content": "If anyone outside of Broadway wasn't aware that Bob Fosse was a genius, Cabaret certainly let them know. Fosse took a beautiful \"little\" musical and saw immediately how to translate it into a film. Lots of us missed the romance of the landlady and the grocer, along with the lovely song, \"Marriage\", but the issue a hand was that Fosse and Kander and Ebb agreed the subject of the insidious rise of the Nazi movement needed to be handled in a much bigger way.Bob Fosse's vision and instincts were perfect. Kander and Ebb wrote some new music. Joel Grey came from Broadway as the centerpiece of the film -- and he won a much deserved Oscar for his role as the ever so creepy emcee. The romance of the seniors was replaced by a romance between two younger Jews, one of whom is concealing that fact in an effort to avoid Nazi harassment. A very rich and very, very decedent character is introduced to underline the moral decrepitude of Sally Bowles and to facilitate displaying the downward spiral of Germany into the Nazi influence.I've never thought Liza Minelli was a great actress and I still don't. She's a very talented performer, though not nearly so as her mother. Bob Fosse directed her performance in \"the role of her life\". He got everything she had and rolled it into Sally Bowles. Michael York could have been stronger, but that would not have fit his role. He was just a smart and very naive man who was an instrument of whichever character wanted to manipulate him. In fact, all but the Emcee and Sally Bowles are characters totally subjugated by the story.The film takes us on a brilliant downward spiral ride with extraordinary music and the amoral emcee making sure we take notice of the fact we're on the road to hell. The rich German character is a sort of \"assistant emcee\" who does his job away from the cabaret. He makes sure we see that Sally Bowles cares nothing for anyone but herself, a self that is all veneer and no real substance.Of all the scenes in the film, I recall one with a palpable shudder. It takes place on a beautiful day. The Sally Bowles menage-a-trois is off on a drive in the country and stops at an open air biergarten. A beautiful young Aryan boy in the Nazi youth organization rises to sing a song. His voice is even more beautiful than his appearance. The song, \"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\" is a heart-stopping scary indicator of how far Germany has fallen under the Nazi influence. This scene is as scary and creepy a scene as I've ever watched in all my years of movie-going.Bob Fosse was up against The Godfather when his Cabaret came out. There's no doubt The Godfather was a great film, but even with a projected tsunami of awards going its' way, all the key aspects of Cabaret beat it out. Liza Minelli won an Oscar for her morally bankrupt Sally Bowles. Joel Grey won an Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of the true heart of the musical, The Emcee. The cinematography, always perfect, often totally off the charts brilliant won an Oscar. And, of course, Bob Fosse won his Oscar for best director.What a shame Bob Fosse always burned his candle at both ends -- and with the force of a flamethrower. If he had managed to stay with us longer his body of work might have shone at least as bright, if not the brightest, of all film directors. Did anyone out there see his biography-pic of Lenny Bruce? Not everything he did was a film musical. On Broadway his light as a dancer/choreographer/director shines so bright that even today you need to wear dark glasses to look at it. His first film set a new standard for film musicals, and set the bar so high I wonder if anyone will even approach it. Such was his brilliance, such is the brilliance of his Cabaret.",

Liza Minnelli was great as the Cabaret singer Sally Bowles, there are some scenes where she sounded like her mother Judy Garland for example the part where she tells Brian (Michael York) why she had an abortion.

Liza Minelli plays cabaret singer Sally Bowles, a free spirit who invites uptight Brit Michael York into her world of sordid sexuality and greedy excess but who, deep down, is an immature waif starved for daddy's attention. Bob Fosse uses his dancer's experience to good effect in the cabaret sequences and Kander and Ebb's musical commentary is tart and enjoyable. Jay Presson Allen's script is a bit too foreshadowing (the choice to have a young Nazi lead a beer garden full of Germans in \"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\" is unfortunate because it's sung in English) and the film kind of peters out at the end. But it's a good topic for Hollywood to tackle and the sleaze quotient makes it go down easy.",

It isn't but she's so dynamic in the musical numbers that it hardly matters. Michael York is beautiful and sometimes even charming as her leading man.

            "review_title": "The Unstoppable Liza & Incomparable Joel Grey",
            "content": "\"Life is a cabaret, old chum. Come to the cabaret!\" croons a divine Sally Bowles, the American expatriate living in pre-World War Two decadent Berlin, sleeping around and dancing on stage at the Kit-Kat club, played with great vulnerability and aplomb by Liza Minnelli. Partnered with Joel Grey's astonishing turn as the Master of Ceremonies, the two shine in Bob Fosse's remarkable musical Cabaret, a film that foregrounds the messy, tumultuous relationships among Sally, her next door neighbor and lover, the very British Brian Roberts (Michael York), a charismatic German businessman Baron Maximilian (Helmut Griem) with his laissez faire political and sexual interests, and another couple, one Jewish, one not. Ultimately, the film foretells the growing crucible of Berlin with its boots and swastikas, its fear and violence, by focusing on the lives of these men and women in a time of growing crisis. Liza Minnelli carries the film with a performance of great humanity and grace. Her expressive eyes do so much work in the many close-up shots that Fosse employs; her singing and choreography are both stunningly original and remarkably human. She lives, breathes, performs like a performer, and despite the role's manic-pixie-dream-girl template, Minnelli plumbs the depths of Sally's misery and anxiousness: her anger at her absent father, her ardent desire for fame, her unflappable determination to be the life of the party. A favorite scene involves Sally Bowles trying to contain herself while in the presence of another beautiful woman, and the gestures and frustration boil over in ways that are interesting and true. Minelli's Sally Bowles is a sad character, one of intelligence and passion, and one that I fear for in the ramp-up to the Third Reich. Perhaps, Sally's character lacks some of the naivet\u00e9 or hollowness that Fosse intends by casting her with the dynamic Liza Minnelli (In fact, I had a difficult time figuring out how anyone would not be captivated by Sally, not take her to Hollywood, not make her a star!). Simply put, the film would not work without Minnelli's tour de force performance of singing, dancing, and embodying the weakness and the strength of Sally Bowles, the American who has lost her way in a darkening city. In addition to riveting dance numbers and filming everything with medium shots or close-ups which give great focus on the eyes, make-up, and lips of characters, director Bob Fosse stages tableau shots which give us snapshots of the time: the beaten Kit-Kat club owner, bloodied by Nazi boots; a Russian corpse, presumably communist, strewn across a busy street with people looking in horror; an older German man who remains sitting while everyone around him stands in a nationalistic fever singing the song \"Tomorrow Belongs To Me,\" in a moment of ominous foreshadowing. Fosse inserts German radio in the background of multiple scenes at Sally and Brian's flat, with the chatter underlining the rise of Nazism and Hitler, along with an elderly German woman stating at one point, \"I wish we could go back to the days of the Kaiser!\" And the emcee, Master of Ceremonies, and Greek chorus of Cabaret is the marvelous Joel Grey, an elfin performer with a haunting and childlike whimsy of a performance with wigs, make-up, various costume changes which go from milkmaid to goose stepping soldier, and a charismatic sense of play. The emcee's role, it seems, is to welcome and usher us into the darkness and twisted mirrors of the Kit-Kat club, to entertain us with his commentary and routines, to comment on the chapters of the film itself through song and dance and comedy, as well as to provoke us into considering the role of art in a fascist state, the role of the artist who performs for those he or she may personally abhor. Can you take a Nazi Party member's money as an artist? Should you? In a world where famous musical artists are taken to task for exorbitant birthday party performances such as Beyonce or Mariah Carey's recent events for the late dictator Moammar Gadhafi, the role of the artist when confronted with cruel power is still present with us today. Grey's emcee playfully sings a dazzling array of songs with amazing choreography, and the film lights up every time he appears. Fosse shows restraint and lets dance sequences play out in real-time or at least in long, unbroken takes compared to the frenetic editing of today's films, allowing us to drink in everything that is going on at once on stage, as well as giving the cramped, confined quarters of the Kit-Kat club stage with its mirrors, curtains, and band an intimate feel; the barrier between performer and audience is nearly nonexistent as Grey dips into the audience from time to time for jokes and laughter. Fosse uses shots of the Master's face as jump cuts at other important moments in the film, signifying the performer's role as always commenting on those men and women and their travails, always seeing everything around him in the city as it spirals and spirals. It is an astonishing performance. The Master of Ceremonies adds an elegiac air to the dwindling days of bustling, cosmopolitan Berlin. By all accounts, it was one of the most wonderful cities in the world during this time. The audience slowly changes over the course of the film until the devastating final shot. His songs and dancing then take on the air of a survivalist, a clownish desperate attempt to curry favor and possible reprieve from what is to come. Is there hope? When the SS Storm Troopers come to the Kit-Kat club, and come they will, the Master of Ceremonies and his troupe will have no place in the Third Reich. We know where the Nazis will place them.",

Cabaret is more sexual, playful and colourful. The colours are rich and dark compared to the soothing blues and greens in The Sound of Music, indicating that this movie is darker in nature, appealing to more sexual and naughty pleasures. There are costumes and make up, revealing a sort of covering which does not occur in the free, real scenes at the beginning of The Sound of Music.

The movie does not rely on any gimmicks or special effect, but rather, it appeals to emotion and fantasy. The only noteworthy efforts in this movie are the Master of Ceremonies and Liza Minnelli's. Bottom Line: An interesting adaptation of 3 stage plays, none of which are very great.",

That is the powerful song \"Tomorrow Belongs to Us\" and yet not once has the young singer been mentioned by name by anyone, including the makers of the film. There is no question that the situation in the country, Germany, at the time portrayed in this film, shows how the Nazis were growing not only in power but also in their attempt at stifling any expression by the people. The happenings are emphasized by attacks committed by the Nazis on the owner of the Kit Kat Klub, which are quite obvious to any viewer, but it that song by the young man that shows that ideology weas beiing supported by the majority of the German people of those times.",

And we don't know what would happen to the Jew couple. (But we can imagine, can't we?)No violence, but it's even more forceful, right? The singing young Nazi boy is even more unforgettable than the concentration camps or war scenes. It tells how horrible Nazi was, better than the Nazi war-crime-film cliche does.Needless to say, the very last shot, Nazis' faces reflected on a metal surface, in absolute silence, is breath-taking.Michael is the 'hero' in this film. Michael knew what Nazi was very well and he criticised. But he's not so 'heroic', he has his weakness. It makes me remember Tomas in the unbearable lightness of being.The film shows no serious Nazi crimes directly, instead, it shows how decadent, happy ppl lived before Hitler.

            "content": "\"Cabaret\" was the most influential musical film since \"42nd Street\". Widled considered one of the greatest films ever made, it follows the young, wild and sensitive American Sally Bowles, who lives in Berlin and work in cabaret \"Kit Kat Club\". She met Brian Roberts, a young British, shy and reserved who needs work as a English teacher. They immediately feel attracted for each other but some problems come with her obsession with money and his attraction for other men. Meanwhile, a destructive power grows in Berlin...In the early '70s, when the films that explore violence and sex began to take care of movie theaters, musicals seemed to be too outdated to suit young moviegoers expectations with the \"New Hollywood\". Until Bob Fosse (doubtless, the most underrated director) adapted a Broadway musical that defined the posterior types of it's genre. \"Cabaret\" is not full of sparkles, it does not have a happy ending and is waaaaaaay sexual for kids used to having the Gene Kelly movies. Still, it is the adult themes (that even some adults are not mature well enough to understand them) which include corruption, sexual ambiguity, false dreams and hedonism that include it as one of the most important of the 70's.",

            "content": "Oh whoopie, look at this- I get 100th comment.Right... my original interaction with this movie was last May (2005) when I was given a CD of various Broadway songs... one of them being the revival (1998) version of the song \"Cabaret,\" from \"Cabaret\" of course...So when a production of the show came to my city this last month, I was eager to see such. I adored the show, and a week later I had the soundtrack to the 1998 revival.Well you know, I couldn't exactly see the show every night, and my friend had told me how strangely different than the play the movie was, so of course I had to see it.This was a VERY WEIRD remake.I see that people have already picked up that \"Married\" was left out... but the thing is that it isn't just \"Married\" (at one point, we can also hear a record of \"It Couldn't Please Me More\" and \"Sitting Pretty\"), but the entire plot line between Fraulein Schneider and Herr Shulz was left out.In the play, these two are humongous characters, and very good characters might I add. These two are completely dropped. In the play, Max is hardly a character, but in the movie he's humongous.However, I am not saying that this was a BAD remake- but a very odd one; and so much different than the play! I could babble on and on about this, but I do have other things to get to.VERY inappropriate as well- the film has been rated PG, which surprises me, for \"A Chorus Line\" (which came out not much later) was rated PG-13, and this was much worse. In short, don't let your children come anywhere near it.Ooh gawed, hated Sally's hair.The styles of Sally Bowles were atrocious; whereas in the play they were a bit unappealing, but not as exaggerated as in this version.One thing I'm quite surprised I haven't commented on- I was very bummed by the amount of the Master of Ceremonies bits they took out... the Emcee was one of my very favorite characters in the play, and yet his part was so much smaller in the movie...However, this is not to say I am not impressed with this- as an original idea picked up from a very impressive play, I am quite fine with it. However, as a remake of a play, it is terrible.If you haven't seen the play, and you're ready for an extremely ironic, dark, somehow amusing, extremely disturbing movie, go ahead- watch Cabaret.If you've seen the play and want to see it again, don't expect it of this movie version.",

The editing is also extremely well done also smoothly moving between song and story and vice versa. The only issue I had with this was the story while very interesting felt like it was underwhelming and I would have like to have seen the Nazis take a bigger focus although I get why it was done that way and it feels like it can lose focus sometimes in the middle and slow the otherwise well done pacing.

Mono soundtrack aside, this is absolutely glorious and magical and after 2hrs in the wonderful company of Liza Minnelli's star-making turn as the brittle survivor Sally Bowles, Michael York's understating performance as the vulnerable but knowing Brian Roberts and Joel Grey's sexually liberating Masters of Ceremonies, my overwhelming reaction is how incredibly well this film has aged. Based on Christopher Isherwood's stories (note: plural), which were inspired by his own personal experience in Berlin before the WWII, Jay Presson Allen's episodic screenplay (where arguably side/supporting characters vanish and reappear as and when needed as its focus remains firmly fixated on the main couple), is primarily a love story between two champagne-swilling, pleasure-orientated characters living in the peripheral of society against the background of Germany's then political upheaval and the rise of Nazism. It's therefore a film of contrast and juxtaposition, as quick snapshot-like edits insinuate meaningfully while Kander and Ebb's songs are tightly interwoven into the fabric of its narrative to comment or foreshadow what's happening on-screen. Fosse's execution still feels entirely contemporary watching it now, and the film has lost none of its charms \u2013 stupendous performances and choreography blend harmoniously into each other while the melodically infectious songs have now attained classical status; or impact \u2013 'Tomorrow Belongs To Me' remains an eerily prescient and relevant warning and never have three little words like 'so do I' possess such power and significance as they did here.

            "content": "A glorious and delightful musical for the ages.\n\nIconic director Bob Fosse's magical direction for his romantic musical Cabaret (1972) is resplendent in his elegant grandeur and peerless visual prowess. Fosse's dance choreography alone is some of the most versatile and creative steps ever laid down for a musical, let alone his perceptive direction that subtly depicts the free love of old Germany pre-World War II with a playful heart. Fosse's direction is loving and sincerely cares about these outrageous characters. Fosse delivers dazzling dance choreography, nuanced direction, passionate romance, subtle storytelling, salacious material, hilarious jokes, biting satire of Germany's burgeoning fascist Nazi regime, and cute character quirks. No wonder Bob Fosse instantly became a beloved director after Cabaret! I've never seen anything quite like Cabaret.\n\nWriters Jay Presson Allen, John Van Druten, and Joe Masteroff came up with simply wonderful jokes that are edgy, fresh, progressive, and delirious fun. The touching story has raw character drama that's genuinely emotional as well as hilarious absurdist humor all over Cabaret. Combining Cabaret the play with a book into a viscerally delightful musical film is quite brilliant. You can see some influence from Marlene Dietrich's Morocco and Blue Angel to stories like The Great Gatsby in Cabaret. Yet, Cabaret's influence goes on to inspire The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Showgirls, Chicago, Burlesque, Madonna, Lady Gaga, countless others. It's avant-garde in the best ways with a fresh perspective on old values and new complex feelings.\n\nLiza Minnelli is adorable, sultry, funny, charming, and dazzling in Cabaret. Her lead actress role gives funny comedy, moving dramatic acting, fierce singing, and daring dancing. Her turn as the  erratic and erotic Sally Bowles is an iconic femme fatale on her own terms. She flirts, jokes, and parties her way into your heart. She looks like she's having so much fun compared to Martin Scorsese's dour and depressing New York, New York. Cabaret is simply Liza Minnelli's shining starlet moment. She is perfect.\n\nMichael York plays stuffy English gentleman Brian Roberts with a bisexual twist that's shocking and fun to watch. His romantic chemistry with Liza is out of this world. Joel Grey's Master of Ceremonies at The Cabaret is hilarious. His every line and dance move is a raunchy riot! Fritz Wepper's German gigolo Fritz Wendel with a need for a rich wife is so hilarious and likable. He's as great as Michael York in my opinion. Marisa Berenson is lovely and charming as Jewish heiress Natalia Landauer. Helmut Griem's curious Baron Maximilian von Heune is a sizzling delight on his own.\n\nDavid Bretherton's editing is brilliant as he juxtaposes the cruelty of the Nazis with sudden tongue in cheek musical numbers. Cabaret is a full 124 and yet it feels like a fast 30 because it never stops moving.\n\nGeoffrey Unsworth's gorgeous cinematography uses lights behind Liza to create a silhouette and has characters surrounded by shadows or reflected in mirrors. Every shot feels beautiful and creative with a visual brilliance just as impressive as the acting and musical performances. Hans J\u00fcrgen Kiebach's art direction is dazzling with recreations of 1930's Berlin, Germany right before World War II. I love the graffiti on the walls and shady brick buildings everywhere. It feels moody with stellar production design that does not feel too stagey with eerie lights cascading down on everyone.\n\nComposer John Kander's boisterous music is both lovely and playful with plenty of lively energy and variations. I love the cute songwriting from the Broadway musical that is given a new life that will last forever with cute and clever lyrics alongside Kander's vivid musical imagination. Cabaret has some of the greatest musical songs ever, in all honesty. Charlotte Flemming's burlesque costumes are sexy and playful with a whimsical nature besides being provocative. You can see where The Rocky Horror Picture Show got their lingerie for Tim Curry from besides actual nightclub acts.\n\nIn conclusion, Cabaret is a brilliantly crafted picture and exhilarating musical that will always feel timeless.",

The film is an artistic classic with its imagery and depictions of the rise of fascism in 1931 Germany alongside the gritty bohemian life at the Kit Kat Club.

It's a tipping point moment and Fosse colours the piece with brownshirts, swasticas, clean cut Arian youth to whom the future belongs and the communist symbolism of other simple solutions to complex problems. It's the foreboding of oncoming Naziism that dominates, with the growing unease of the Jews whose purgatory is beautifully written in the relationship of Natalia and Fritz whose wealth and Protestant masks won't spare them and the oncoming sanctimonious violence shown in the mirror images of the beaten doorman and executed dog lying dead as a symbol of a passing better age. The character of Baron Maximilian von Heune is fully realised and gives the tragic tell of 1933; great fun, champagne swilling, bisexual up for everything chap of the absolute Prussian blue blood who doesn't understand that his class' birth and power isn't a match for the Nazi zeitgeist, who won't just accept a few minor government positions and do their bidding versus the communists. \nIt's the essence of cabaret itself that things are not what they seem. The supposedly pure are evil, the degenerates warm, the powerful weak and the weak strong. It's told through the eyes of Brian who doesn't understand anything about Berlin but discovers these things through the journey. We know it ends as badly as anything can but that doesn't negate the positivity in the people and construct at the centre of the drama, and as we come out of lockdown, remember:\nWhat good is sitting alone In your room?\nCome hear the music play.\nLife is a Cabaret, old chum,\nCome to the Cabaret.",

Minnelli brings to life a wonderfully conflicted character whose story is compelling in its treatment of women both for its target setting and its year of release. That said, the secondary romantic subplot in which a Jewish man passing as Protestant woos a wealthy Jewish heiress feels almost childishly simplistic by comparison to the undercurrents of rising fascism and the relationship between Minneli's Bowles and the two members of her love triangle; it's seldom touched on and never explored sufficiently. The film contrasts a stunning vibrancy in its musical performances (brought to life chiefly by an immensely watchable performance from Grey, who was rewarded with an Oscar for his effort) with a stark cruelty from initially brief moments that gradually grow in intensity, until even Grey's charismatic Master of Ceremonies finds himself infected despite \"leaving his troubles at the door\". Apart from the roots on the stage, it's strange to characterize the film as a musical; Cabaret is a straightfroward drama in which music is a crucial element, but does not feature in the manner of typical musical theatre. I love the characterization of the cabaret itself, with theatre depicted as a sort of eternal presence and a reflection of humanity; intensely fluid, radically subject to changes in tastes, and far from infallible.

Unwittingly, perhaps, this echo gives voice to a symbolic symbiosis and ideological continuum between, on the one hand, parties in the sense of social gatherings for personal ends and parties in the sense of social organizations for political ends, on the other. Elsewhere in the film, with rapid edits intercutting between the stage and the street, Fosse illustrates the relationship of bodily violence\u2014how else to describe the contortions of the dancers?\u2014gaudy decadence, and exuberant obscenity that connects the two parties, the entertaining and the institutional. \n\nThe implication is the overbearing, overdetermined tautology that \u00abthe party is the party\u00bb, exalted to the extent that either is exclusive, the vulgarism of the one undergirding the civic acceptability of the other, like a jester to a king (or an effete emcee to a chauvinist f\u00fchrer). In contrast to the puritanism of America (where the film was originally rated X on account of its frank queer themes), nowhere is this coincidence of seeming opposites clearer than with the Nazis, the vulgarity of the Volk matched only by the rigidity of the Reich. The movie stages the inherent ideological contradiction in perhaps its most famous and effective scene, as an idyllic country air sung by a handsome Hitlerjunge slowly yet effortlessly and practically organically transforms into a raucous military march\u2014showing how, in its own perverse way, the party swings both ways.",

The dancing, the showmanship, the performances, the depiction of a once carefree and bohemian city slowly sliding into an era of oppression and brutality. Liza Minelli is the acting standout, capable of both infectious wonderment and a powerful lust for life, while also capturing the characters lowest moments with absolute sincerity. Joel Grey is also excellent, giving us some of the biggest and brightest facial expressions ever caught on film, and represents many of the jolliest scenes in the film. It takes a likeable love story, turns it into a love triangle, and frames all of it against a backdrop of escalating tension and racial prejudice. The film slows down considerably when it gets into the 2nd half, and its feels like many important scenes have been cut out, meaning plot threads, such as the aforementioned love triangle, end with little to no resolution. The same is true of the editing, with numerous scenes cutting away like the editor chopped the film at the wrong place. But these issues aside, Cabaret is still a film I'd recommend to anyone interested in musicals or the time period. It's fun, brilliantly acted and made with obvious passion.

            "content": "\"SCREW MAXIMILIAN!\"\n\n\"...... I do.\"\n\n\"..... so do I.\"\n\nIt's early 1930s Berlin as the Nazis begin to take over Germany as American Kit Kat Club cabaret singer Sally Bowles meets a lodger, an English language teacher, that will be staying in the same building as her. She falls in love with him but soon discovers he's gay.... and eventually finds out he's bisexual.\n\nThis is quite a movie. Almost TOO much to handle in one sitting it's so different. It's such a jarring movie to watch that I got confused at certain points and it's all because of it's killer style.\n\nAnd the style of this musical is.... it's not exactly a musical. Bob Fosse and company took out all the \"book songs\", the songs where characters sing to EACH OTHER and only left in the songs sung in the actual Kit Kat Club. So what this means is all of the musical numbers are 100% diegetic. Nobody breaks into the song in the middle of a dialog scene, the dialog scenes are dialog scenes. Michael York who plays Brian... doesn't sing a note in the movie. The only characters who do sing are played by Liza Minelli and Joel Grey and they only sing in the Kit Kat Club.\n\nSo basically this is a musical for people who hate musicals. And that's really what it was in 1972. Movie audiences hated musicals by the time they got out of the 60s. Movies were about realism and not escapism anymore. Which is weird when you think about it. In the 50s movies were all about escapism and yet times were good. Times got bad in the 60s and 70s and audiences don't want to escape anymore.... doesn't exactly make sense to me but it's what happened.\n\nAnd so Bob Fosse made a musical that HAS loads of lavish Broadway-style musical numbers and yet it comes off as a totally realistic movie. And THAT would probably be why he won the Oscar for Best Director for this movie among other reasons. And while I would have voted for Francis Ford Coppola for The Godfather that year... I understand the voters' decisions.\n\nLiza Minelli is incredible in this. She has a dual role essentially. She has this dramatic side of Sally, the dialog scenes, this love triangle she's in with a German aristocrat and Brian.... but she also has to have the musical side as the cabaret singer... and she does both brilliantly. And of course that's why SHE won an Oscar for this movie. It's great watching Wizard of Oz for the first time with Judy Garland and then seeing her daughter in another iconic musical with Cabaret. They're both amazing performers.\n\nJoel Grey won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for playing the Emcee of the Kit Kat Club and... beat out all 3 nominees from The Godfather... he beat Sonny! And of course I wouldn't have voted for him in place of someone from The Godfather... but he was pretty damn good. Unlike Sally we never see this guy OUT of this club so he's always in musical mode. And his character singing these songs is such a great contrast to the dramatic side of the movie. You have these moments where the songs reflect the times in the story and it's this genius moment where the Nazism on one side of the movie comes together with the lavish musical side and it adds up to something pretty wicked.\n\nLike this bit where we have the girls of the Kit Kat club doing this number in lingerie... and suddenly we see the Emcee is in drag among them. And they're wearing this bowler hats and towards the end of the number they all bend the edges of the hats and they look like that Nazi style helmet and they all start goosestepping across the stage. That's something you don't see in every musical.\n\nAll of the songs by Kander and Ebb are great, it's tough to get Mein Herr out of my head after this movie.\n\n\nThere's one song, maybe Kander and Ebb did it I'm not sure. \u00a0But we have this scene like a picnic in the German countryside. \u00a0And this guy starts singing what seems like a sweet song about youth and how tomorrow belongs to him.... and we pan down and we see his has a brown shirt and a swastika. \u00a0And then the people start singing along. \u00a0And it's clear this isn't a sweet song, this is a song about the Nazis trying to take over the world. \u00a0Now that was a brilliant and disturbing scene.\u00a0\n\nAnd the movie ends with this note that while the story's over... I mean... it's the early days of Nazi Germany so... the world is about to hit a cataclysm. Again... not the note you expect a movie musical to end on.\n\nBob Fosse trying to make a musical for an edgier 1970s movie audience ended up succeeding admirably. That style where all of the songs are given a cinematic context that doesn't come off as phony is a style I wish EVERY musical found a way to use. The LACK of this kind of edge is why I thought Oliver! sucked ass most of the time. It's why Chicago is a personal favorite of mine. Totally using the Fosse cinematic language, in that movie the musical scenes are done as fantasy/dream scenes, which are brilliantly done.\n\nLike I said it's a lot to take in in one sitting but Cabaret is a hell of a movie.",

            "content": "When a respected film critic like Peter Bradshaw calls this film the greatest musical of all time I go into seeing it with high expectations and that was why I was so disappointed when a found a film devoid of pleasures. I was also aware of Liza Minnelli via the great reputation of her in this role as phrases like \u2018iconic' were thrown around willy nilly when discussing her. I found her to be a bad actress in this role as she lacked the ability to transfix me when she wasn't singing and appeared to be playing a version of herself while her singing and dancing was underwhelming. This is not one of the greatest musical films of all time as Singin' in the Rain (1952), One from the Heart (1981) and The Blues Brothers (1980).\n\nThe film concerns the lives of young British student Brian Roberts, Michael York, who moves to the Weimar Club in 1931 and becomes friends with nightclub performer Sally Bowles, Liza Minnelli. Their friends, gigolo Fritz Wendel, Fritz Wepper, and wealthy Jewish woman Maria Landauer, Marisa Berenson, fall in love but are held back by his questionable motives in marrying her and the fact that she is Jewish. We see Bowles go through highs and lows as she performs at the Kit Kat Club and delights audiences but in her personal life goes through ups and downs and eventually has an abortion after an affair ends. The Nazis sweep the area as anti-Jewish sentiment increases and Bowles and Roberts lose their innocence.\n\nThis is one of those films where you are meant to be utterly charmed by the quirky, infantile female lead who immediately enchants our male lead, usually a moody writer, only to participate in a lifestyle of hedonism before his eyes. Unfortunately I was not charmed by this film's lead as she seemed frustratingly empty and lacking in wit and intelligence for a woman who supposedly attracts the attention of all of the men she meets. Minnelli does not have the bright screen presence of a Julie Andrews or a Debbie Reynolds and struggles to make us feel anything but annoyance for her character as her face seems constantly over expressive and she doesn't have the singing or dancing ability to bring this wispy character to life. I am also shocked that Minnelli managed to win the Academy Award for Best Actress when up against Liv Ullmann in The Emigrants (1972) who would have been the deserving winner in 1972. She is surrounded by a cast who have even less presence than she does as York is utterly unconvincing as the lead character, Berenson is best when she is standing still and looking like a portrait subject as in Barry Lyndon (1975) and I don't understand any of the love for Joel Grey.\n\nThe film as a musical also doesn't really fill it's requirements as while it contains 12 songs I don't remember any of them having just watched this film and all of the songs performed on the stage blended together. As stated before Minnelli's voice is not particularly appealing as she doesn't inject any of these songs with any of the passion and fire necessary to make them exciting. I felt as though I could have seen these performances on any street corner featuring mediocre buskers. I have been told that the point is that Bowles is a bad singer but if that's the whole point then I would have liked one scene to set this up and then I would have liked to see an actress who can actually play a character add depth to this person beyond her bad singing. When I watch a musical I want the songs and the performances of them to impress me and have me remember the songs after I have finished watching the film, this movie did not achieve this and therefore I see it as having failed in it's ambitions.\n\nIt is clear by this point that I would not recommend this film and I am shocked by it's fantastic reputation when it is such an empty production that is charmless in how it goes about telling it's dull story. This should not be considered a classic film.",

The film is about capturing a crucial moment--in the 1930s from the perspective of the 1970s. When you think about the other films being made at this time, Cabaret is in a different class entirely. Also worth seeing: Fosse's \"All that Jazz.\" \n\nThe the opening shot is simple but essential: the cabaret stage appears in the reflection of the distorted surface of a brass musical instrument.

The death of the Hollywood musical - profoundly political and humanistically tragic but made quirky and fun by chorographical genius Bob Fosse.\n\nIn 1972, the death of the glamorous musical occurred. Bob Fosse's Cabaret became a mainstream hit, and people realized that singing in public (in a world that was becoming morally complicated) just doesn't happen very often. So Fosse did the unthinkable and trapped one of the best collection of songs ever written (By Kander and Ebb) inside a cabaret club in Germany, where the Nazi ideology was slowly but surely arising. It's hard to choose a musical number in Cabaret that isn't madly catchy, perverted and fun, but the most powerful moments in the film come from songs that deftly mix tragedy and comedy. Liza Minnelli's final \"Cabaret\" song is desperately sung in such a way that suggests she is putting on a smile for the show while her heart breaks in secret. The fact that she sings about Chelsea (the same place her mother Judy Garland died) is just fundamentally wrong (I think it shows in Liza's fish-eyed gaze) but helps Liza to nail the song perfectly. However, the best moment in the film is unquestionably Tomorrow Belongs to Me. If you have ever been put on the spot to express some form of patriotism but hesitated, then you can relate to this moment. The scene is so beautifully shot and the song is so beautiful, you wouldn't think it's a Nazi call to action at first. The sad fact is that the Nazis wrote pretty songs like we do, and had political campaigns like we do. I wonder how many of you would have stood up for the song out of respect or because of peer pressure if it was your country? With these sorts of themes, it's no wonder that Bob Fosse's Cabaret killed the American Musical. One of the few songs in Cabaret (the play, not the musical) that wasn't endlessly depressing I actually used in my wedding. No, it wasn't Two Ladies. It was \"Married\", a clowny song that suggests life isn't that bad and marriage isn't that scary. \"For you wake one day, look around and say, somebody wonderful married me.\"\n\nWhat I Learned: Taught me that singing and dancing is a tragedy; that we find our own reasons to be happy. We entertain ourselves amid terror, tragedy, and our own kind that we can never trust. Helped me to understand how gullible people really are. Also, had the song \"Marriage\", which my mother sang at my wedding.",

I loved that aspect and thought the singing from Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey was superb. It almost reminded me of Chicago and the way the musical numbers were woven throughout that film as a story-telling method (but I think Chicago might have done it a little better.)\n\nI keep going back and forth on whether I liked the rest of Cabaret. The love triangle was interesting and led to some surprises. I don't know if I ever believed Brian was actually attracted to Sally, but later I discover that's kind of the point. Their interactions seem rather cold, though, as if they didn't even like each other all that much. There could be more going on that I didn't see, and it might be obvious if I watched the movie again sometime.\n\nThe odd thing about this film is the addition of the B-story. I can't figure out why this separate romance between the Jewish couple was even in the movie. It seemed as if they were simply there as a reminder of where and when these events take place. \"See that persecuted Jew? That's because the Nazis are starting to take control.\" Those scenes weren't bad, just irrelevant.\n\nIn fact, throughout the film it felt like they couldn't decide how much they wanted to reference the Nazi threat. At times it almost fades into the background but later it would seriously impact the stars of the movie. I don't know if I wanted it to be more important or less, or maybe it was perfect as it was presented. As you can see I'm still puzzled by Cabaret and have conflicted feelings about it. This is one movie that I'll need to watch again sometime and decide just how good or bad it is.",

It's a musical without the sticky sweet dispositions of its sentimental peers.  Without its superior soundtrack, it would, nonetheless, remain to be a tragic period drama of the highest quality - it's an astute piece of work whose puncturing storyline, whose soul-baring lead performance, arguably blur out its swankiest elements.  It's the first musical I've ever seen (besides that 1979 Earth-shaker) in which the characters don't seem to be performing in stagey spectacles because they enjoy it, because they want to entertain us.  They're performing to survive.  The show will, at some point, stop.  But for now, it must go on, or else their realities might really sink into their psyches and destroy them.\n\t\"Cabaret's\" subversion of musical givens is the thing that has made it so much a part of the public conscious.  Though we might envision Liza Minnelli's Sally Bowles, fitted with a top hat and cheap black lingerie, before we think of its downer of a plot, and though we tend to gravitate toward the grand finale rendition of its titular song instead of reliving its devastating social commentary, it doesn't so much feel like a musical as it does a darkened masterwork that just so happens to feature a hell of a lot of music.\n\tIt's an unparalleled experience that marked for the comeback of Fosse, a cherished theatrical director whose \"Sweet Charity\" (1969) bombed at the box-office, and it's the film that solidified Minnelli's rep as a star that could live up to the expectations set by her extraordinary mother.  \n\t\"Cabaret\" is set in 1931 Berlin, where decadence runs amok, where sexuality is fluid, and where the misanthropic Nazi party is slowly gaining momentum.  Considerable time is spent in the Kit Kat Klub, a hip local joint that utilizes aspiring talent as a way to divert tourists and passersby.  \n\tWith its many shows hosted by an unnamed but endlessly boisterous emcee (Joel Grey), the brightest aspect of the club is Sally Bowles, a bubbly American singer who dreams of someday making it as an actress.  With magnificent stage presence and a sometimes intimidatingly unfiltered personality, she seems destined to become a star - but a young woman living in such a cruel world doesn't always have it so easy, which is why the inclusion of two men, who don't quite understand her, could lead to her downfall.\n\tOne of them is Brian Roberts (Michael York), an intellectual Brit in the process of earning his doctorate.  The other is Maximillian von Heune (Helmut Griem), a charming baron.  Sally and Brian meet through his moving into her boarding house; Max insinuates himself into her social circle and sweeps her off her feet through material seduction.\n\tA love triangle is the last thing Sally needs in her already torrid life, especially one in which the men interested in her might also be interested in each other.  Of the two, though, we prefer Brian, who is sharp, a little selfish and a little sad, but is nevertheless considerate of Sally and her stability.  A conventional conclusion appears to await them, despite his sexual ambiguities.  But an explosive setback, paired with the rising Nazism in Germany, only leaves personal land mines in their paths.\n\tAnd while tragedy is generally not so welcome in a genre that prides itself in its ability to make its viewers feel good, it seems just about right in \"Cabaret.\"  As it unfolds, introducing itself as a showy romp only to shift gears toward three-hankie misfortune, we find ourselves in the presence of a film with a lot more in mind than mere engrossment.  It's a musical that possesses performers that continue to act as they sing and dance - behind their smiles, we can still see the effects of the messy personal live of their characters.  It's a historical piece wise enough to avoid overtly recreating the horrors of its time, characterizing menace and hate with gradual subtlety that shakes us in the way it builds until it becomes distinctly unavoidable. \n\t\"Cabaret\" never forgets its period setting - it likes its style and its costumery, but it doesn't skimp on atrocity, either - and it never takes the abilities of its ensemble for granted.  Minnelli, delivering an iconic performance, captures the spirit of Sally with such persuasion that she doesn't much seem to be a fictional character.  She could also just be well-written (Jay Allen's screenplay is, after all, masterful), but Minnelli is so good that we are never able to see Sally as anything but a vulnerable figure.  Her loud mouth and her infectious swagger are all a part of a front in need of maintaining.  Breaking it would be cataclysmic.\n\tTerrific, too, is Grey, who won and Oscar for his performance and who is not much more than an embodied narrator.  Starring in some of the film's best musical moments, he's pivotal in defining the movie's ascending feeling that, no matter how well one entertains, societal evil is not something that can easily be stopped.  York is understated as a love interest whose eloquence loses its flash as his own doubts radiate; Griem is damaging as a playboy so self-involved that he can hardly tell that his actions do, as a matter of fact, have ramifications.\n\tBut Fosse's direction is \"Cabaret's\" finest component.  To make a movie as aesthetically complicated as this one seem seamless takes incredible dedication and perception.  His fostering of cocksure song-and-dance sequences (\"Maybe This Time\" and \"Money, Money\" are highlights) and his determination to portray genuinely effectual scenes (the chilling performance of \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" will never lose its malevolence, and Sally and Brian's break-up is an outstanding showcase of acting) make \"Cabaret\" so much more than your typical musical - it's often been recognized as being the \"last great\" one (whatever that really means), and it more likely has to do with the way it emotionally moves us than it does with its music.  \t\n\tComparing its artistic characteristics, though, is not completely necessary in distinguishing \"Cabaret\" as the masterpiece that it is.  It's a tour-de-force, a marrying of varying types of performative perfection.  Its freshness is still unprecedented.  Maybe it is the last great musical, but only because so few are able to top it.  We've had some good ones since.  But none have matched in their poignancy, their power.",

            "content": "It is very important to note that Bob Fosse's 1973 masterpiece is in no way a traditional musical. Push the Broadway play to the side. This is Film Art at it's finest. \n\nInspired by Christopher Isherwood's 1945 semi-autobiographical book, \"The Berlin Stories\" a very successful Broadway play was created. But in the early 1970's when Fosse decided to translate it to film --- he approached it all from a dramatically different way. With the writing skills of Jay Presson Allen secured, the Broadway Musical became more of a Film With Music. Fosse was most definitely concerned with the female lead character, \"Sally Bowles\" and her steadfast rebellious notion of \"Divine Decadence\" -- but with film he could take the \"metaphorical\" to a more literal exploration of Berlin as it was slipping toward the unspeakable horrors of Nazism and The Third Reich. With Geoffrey Unsworth serving as Cinematographer the film seamlessly slides from what we see being presented on the stage of the seedy Kit Kat club to the quickly approaching realities outside its doors. Fosse captures a culture which is at once \"progressive\" as it is \"unaware.\" \n\nMichael York is \"Brian\" who serves as a fictional idea of writer Christopher Isherwood. Newly arrived to Berlin, he is eager to explore what he perceives as more free culture. As curious as he is, he is not quite ready to accept his own sexuality. The complexities of sexuality and love are as core to this film as are the catastrophic doom that most seem to view as a temporary reactionary group of nuts. The very real threat of Fascism and its consequences are ignored. The main characters of Cabaret are too distracted by their carnal desires and reverie to be bothered. \n\nFilm Culture has forgotten that Liza Minnelli was once a respected artist. She did it all: Actor, Singer and a very accomplished dancer. Sadly, her privately struggles have taken over the way she is now viewed. There are very few moments when an actor is this perfectly matched in her role. Liza Minnelli gives a truly amazing performance. It is an erotically-fueled study in self-absorption merged into self-loathing. It seems as if \"Sally\" is always in audition mode. She is a tragic and heartbreaking character. And Minnelli literally \"becomes\" this character for the entirety of the movie. Equally impressive is Joel Grey who manages to not only serve as \"our\" master of ceremonies but creepy monster who is all too eager to lead us into darkness as much as to the technicolor musical numbers on the stage. Both would receive Oscars for their performances. \n\nIt is also interesting to note that this was the year of The Godfather. While it won best film --- best director honor was given to Bob Fosse. It with hindsight that we realize that this was one of those rare moments the Academy Awards got it right. Godfather was the stronger film, but what Bob Fosse was able to achieve in Cabaret is far more challenging and important. If you've never seen it, you need to. This is an essential film.",

            "content": "This film may look like it is just a lot of fun, and it is, but there is also a very dark undertone to it all and the longer the film goes on, the more it corrupts. 'Cabaret' is a mesmerising film that is truly an experience. \n\nThe way this film starts is very smart and it very easily draws you into its world, the songs are all memorable and are excellently choreographed, but of course they are as this is Bob Fosse we're talking about, they also come fully alive and jump out of the screen. The film is funny but in a rather cynical sense, and the characters are well written and smartly developed, the acting is also fantastic. Joel Grey might seem like he isn't in it enough but he makes his presence known and really stands out; and once more, the male actor from a stage production is in the film adaptation and wins an Oscar with the female lead not even being in the film adaptation but at least this time the female lead won as well! I felt like she wasn't in the film enough and that she didn't really have enough musical numbers but in those numbers she, like Grey, make their presence known. And, hey, Maggie Smith won the previous time Minnelli was nominated and now it's the opposite, funny how it all works out like that. \n\nI never have any expectations when I watch a film but when I saw promotional images of the film I did think it was going to be a balls to the wall, rush of a film where you feel, the good kind of, exhausted by the end of it, the kind of feeling found in 'Moulin Rouge!'. I thought it'd stick two fingers up at the establishment or 'the man' as it were, but, in its own subtle way, it kind of does, given the smart themes it tackles. Also, when I first read the synopsis I thought this would be a club that was oppresses by the Nazi's and they would have to secretly work their way of it behind the scenes. \n\nI am a little surprised in the direction this film went though, if someone were to show me a screenshot of an hour into this film I'd be surprised at where our characters end up. I understand the point of those scenes as it reveals some key details, even if it looked like poor Brian was a third wheel from just what we are shown, it just ultimately felt like those scenes could have executed another way as it seems like they're pointless after they are over and how that character exits. The side characters were a nice addition and help compliment the theme as well but I just didn't feel like it was all that necessary either, considering how fast that story wraps up. \n\nThe film ends the way it began and it leaves us rather suddenly on an ominous and sad note. It goes quiet all of a sudden and it's very effective, I found myself just watching the silent credits and taking in what just happened and how truly depressing it is to know what will happen next. I was thinking the ending was going to be rather sudden with everyone getting killed or something, but the smart and subtle way this carries its story and perfect ending, it does it fantastically. \n\nThis might sound negative but that's honestly because I loved everything else and simply can't say anything more than that, this is a groundbreaking, hugely influential and dark film. It's funny how this and 'The Godfather', two films seemingly on totally opposite ends of the spectrum, went up against one another at the 45th Academy Awards. I remember reading a review of this film saying that 'The Godfather' had already won Best Picture, as well as its other two wins, before it was even made, and while I love that film and the next two parts, from the outside looking it, it does look kind of strange for this to win as much as it did and not the highest honour as well as its Writing nomination, it's still a rarity now. Still, 1972/3 were good years for Fosse as he had won quite a number of awards all across the board. Bob Fosse knew exactly what to do and he has made an excellent film, he probably isn't appreciated as much as he should be, but everyone knows his works even if they don't know his name. Like the rest of Fosse's work, this film is indeed hugely influential as the musicals of 2001/2 that helped revitalise the genre feel hugely inspired by this; even if by that point, some of the unique things about this had become clich\u00e9s at that point, but still this is a classic for a good reason.",

The acting is really good. Liza Minelli and Michael York are both brilliant. The rest of the acting is really good, it's the best part of the movie. The direction is rather good, the dancing scenes are all really good. The editing and cinematography is really good. The scene where the man is beaten in the street, intercut with a dancing scene is fantastically edited. Unfortunately I have quite a few problems. Liza Minelli while she did give a really good performance her character was so unlikeable, she was really rude and just didn't shut up, she also SPOILER ALERT gets pregnant and it's unsure wether her boyfriend got her pregnant or if it was a one night stand, that just annoys me as she is very unfaithful and just down right annoying. The main two male leads however were really good and made the scenes with Liza bearable. This film unfortunately is actually quite boring. There's this big portion to do with love that is just so dull and uninteresting. There's also this really creepy man who is part of the dancing who looks like pee wee Herman that is so creepy. However all the nazi stuff is handled brilliantly. There's one fantastic scene to do with a Hitler Youth singing that is just brilliant Overall this is a decent film with fantastic aspects about it. See it if you want but in my opinion it is no masterpiece. B",

            "content": "I just had the privilege of seeing this in authentic film projection at the Cin\u00e9ma Odyss\u00e9e here in Strasbourg (first time I've been to that cinema), and man was it a unique experience. They show a lot of other classic films, so I'll definitely be going back there many times in the future.\n\n\"Cabaret\" looks great, with some of the best lighting effects I've seen in a film. The Oscar-winning cinematography is astounding, with intimate close-up shots and epic wide shots framed underneath the performers at the Kit Kat Klub to give them a sense of grandiosity. No wonder this film's cinematographer was Geoffrey Unsworth, the guy who shot \"2001: A Space Odyssey\".\n\nMy favorite technical aspect of \"Cabaret\" is the editing, with an assault of fast cuts during the musical numbers to show the expressions on people's faces in the crowd as well as the entertaining and somewhat scary faces that the emcee (Joel Grey) pulls. On pure speed and energy alone, it's the most impressively edited film I've seen since \"Whiplash\".\n\nIts best scenes are certainly the dance numbers at the Kit Kat Klub, in which the emcee and the film's main character Sally (Liza Minnelli) perform weird and wonderful ditties set to annoyingly catchy music. Both won Oscars for their performances; Minnelli absolutely deserved it and I can see the love for Grey too.\n\nThe actual story has very little to with the Klub, though the musical numbers are loosely linked to the story's themes. The movie, like the stage play it's based on, is set in Germany in the 1930s, on the eve of the rise of the Nazis.\n\nCentral character Sally is a dancer at the Klub who aspires to be an actress, who falls in love with Brian (Michael York), a professor staying in the same building as her. She teaches the stiff Englishman how to love while he teaches his two young German students (Fritz, played by Fritz Wepper, and Natalia, played by Marisa Berenson) how to speak English. Fritz and Natalia of course become romantically involved as well, but their relationship is complicated since she's Jewish and everyone around them seems to be repeating Nazi propaganda like a mantra.\n\nThere are, of course, complications with Sally and Brian's relationship, also. She's wooing a rich baron, Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem), and Brian is afraid she's being unfaithful. Things only get more complicated when Brian, too, falls for the Baron, leading to one of the most intimate shots in film history as the three, drunken and dancing, gather around and touch their heads together in a circle.\n\nThe story is intricate and full of themes that were ahead of their time such as bisexuality and abortion, but everything gets a bit too dry after a while and the film takes far too long to wrap things up. The musical numbers are certainly more exciting and deftly paced than the dramatic scenes, and had the film been a little less indulgent with all of its themes and character arcs it could've been half an hour shorter and even more effective.\n\nThe often strange juxtaposition of the songs and the drama is also a bit confusing at times, and I kinda felt like I did while watching \"Inherent Vice\", except this time I knew what was going on, but couldn't quite figure out why it was being included. Like \"Inherent Vice\", this film might benefit from another watch at some point in the future to see things from a better perspective. This isn't too big a complaint, though, and I think this is a film that any fan of musicals and/or of great cinematography should see.",

            "content": "I never really liked Liza Minnelli. There, I said it. But there is something about her wide-eyed, innocent arrogance that makes her click as Sally Bowles, a dubious supporting character from Christopher Isherwood's \"Goodbye to Berlin\" who somehow became the center of attention in \"Cabaret,\" its musical adaptation. But even without her unrestrained performance--which feels like a blessing half the time and a curse the other half, but is never unremarkable--this would be a top-notch film musical. The direction (by Bob Fosse) is impeccable, even if he does rip off his own \"Sweet Charity\" for a few moments. Every little piece of music and even the tiniest little detail does something to propel the narrative forward in a way that few other directors have ever consistently managed, from the dinginess of the cabaret to the varied levels of enthusiasm expressed by its cavorting dancing girls, from the beautifully edited opening number, \"Wilkommen,\" to the intercutting between a mock boxing match inside the club with a brutal Nazi assault outside. Fosse's choreography is similarly flawless, captured in a vibrant and imaginative way by master cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth. Michael York and Helmut Griem shine as much as they can with so much of the spotlight hogged by Sally, but the real attraction in the cast is Joel Grey as a sly, devious, tantalizingly mysterious Emcee who invites us into a world that we know will shortly become a very dangerous place. And through the dazzling music, gorgeous design, cinematography, and innovative editing (dare you not to feel a chill at the quick cutaway to the Emcee towards the end of the Nazi anthem \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\"), we know it without having to be told. A credit to the musical genre and quite possibly one of the best-directed films of all time.",

            "content": "I don't really watch enough musical cinema, so Cabaret is a good step forward for me to be viewing it.\n\nI can't say that I was too pleased with the story in Cabaret, because it is a very thin one which expects the flashy musical numbers, talented cast and presumed context of the story to hide its simplicity and overshadow it. And there is no denying that it does, but it's still a lazily written one which doesn't have too much depth or originality as one may have hoped. The story in Cabaret plays second fiddle to its flash and rarely touches upon its Nazi universe, deciding instead to play it relatively safe and change it to being a love story between a nightclub performer and an academic. It tries to have serious drama in its subplots, but they are so barely touched upon that it doesn't even seem like the filmmakers should have bothered. Really, Cabaret is a simple love story underneath glitz and glam, but at least it is a good one.\nCabaret is a very flash musical film. It has a lot of vibrant musical numbers with attractive stars, and so as a musical film it does the job. As a story set during WWII, it doesn't explore the setting enough and simply plays it off as a casual commodity, and the central love story between the protagonists is rather pointless because it doesn't really go anywhere and then suddenly ends abruptly at the end of the film with nothing left for it. I couldn't help but ask myself what the point of the entire love story was, except that so the film could stay within the context of being a musical film. But really, it just doesn't have the best story. Fans of classical Hollywood musicals should be able to appreciate it, but viewers looking for something more than a glamourously formulaic musical have other places to go. The subplots don't really add anything to the story either because they aren't really explored all that well or justified for being actually present.\nBut for what it's worth, there are a lot worse musicals out there than Cabaret, and at least it doesn't over-glamourize itself. Thanks to Bob Fosse's Academy Award winning direction, Cabaret finds a certain sense of restraint which protects it from becoming as much of a cheesy film as it could have if it was mishandled. It keeps itself focused on the characters and on being a small scale story which is gentle and easy to watch without being excessively lighthearted. Cabaret actually does put some meaningful drama into the story and examines the relationship between a young American Cabaret singer and a bisexual Englishman. Thanks to a script which stays true to the play very well, Cabaret brings across the same characters from its source material and supplies them with a lot of strong dialogue.\nAnd visually, Cabaret is great. While it doesn't explore its historical context all that well, its visual depiction of 1930's Berlin is very believable thanks to the fine scenery and production design which gives it a firm sense of realism, as well as the fact that the characters all dress in appropriate costumes. It is all captured with a lot of nice cinematography and plays out against a strong musical score, and the visual and auditory aspects of the film combine to form a lot of flashy musical numbers which should please fans of the genre. So Cabaret is a film that knows what it can do and does it, even though there are a few areas where it could have improved itself.\nAnd thanks to the efforts of a tenacious cast, Cabaret is a rounding success.\nLiza Minelli is a terrific lead in Cabaret. The character Sally Bowles is truly the role that she was born to play because as well as emphasising her natural talent for dancing and singing as well as her subtle sex appeal, it really gives her a great character. Sally Bowles is a woman with ambition to really prove herself to the world and achieve her dreams, and that is precisely what Liza Minelli is actually doing in the role. Thanks to her beautiful singing voice, her ability to dance without fear and the fact that she can do all that and act out her character at the same time, she proves to be absolutely perfect for the role. Liza Minelli puts on a magnificent stage persona for the character during the flashy musical numbers, and when she is engaging in her character's complicated romantic relationship, she takes a step back and puts a lot of humanity into the role. Liza Minelli manages to create two key personas for the character Sally Bowles and nails both of them so well that she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for the role in a really deserving victory. Liza Minelli is one of the best reasons to see Cabaret, and she is the most joyful asset of the film.\nMichael York also gives a terrific performance. Although not having the most deep character, Michael York's natural English charm makes him a likable lead, and his ability to interact with the other cast members makes him a likable character to the rest of the crowd also. And his chemistry with Liza Minelli has a certain sense of truth to it. The passion between them feels genuine, and it is because both actors are dedicated to each other. And it makes Michael York really come off as a romantic. Michael York's ambitious charm makes him an ideal casting decision, and he delivers his lines with thought and honesty which results in a fine leading performance.\nLastly, Joel Grey is memorable in Cabaret. With an appearance which has him looking like Charlie Chaplin in a John Waters movie, he makes a memorable impact. And from there he sinks into his gleefully over the top energy as the Emcee in Cabaret. His character is essentially a commodity that Cabaret wheels in when it needs some glamourous silliness and fun, and Joel Grey takes that knowledge and runs with it, injecting flamboyance into the film which is like a mix of vaudeville slapstick and The Rocky Horror Show. Joel Grey's supporting performance in Cabaret is funny and entertaining in a silly way, and I mean that in the best manner of speaking.\n\nSo although Cabaret has an imperfect story and lacks sufficient explanation of its historical context, the charming performances of its cast and the musical energy of the film all shine under the direction of Bob Fosse.",

            "content": "The pursuit of happiness, enshrined as a right in the US Constitution, is one of the greatest motivating factors in all of human history. It can also be one of the biggest distractions. CABARET, from the musical by Kander and Ebb and directed by Bob Fosse, is sort of an examination of this through the historical lens of late Weimar Germany as it succumbed to Nazism. Liza Minnelli is Sally Bowles, a dancer/singer at the Kit Kat Club who has dreams of becoming a famous actress; and Michael York is Brian Jordan, an English philosophy student who is in Germany for cultural enrichment and to make some money. Both of these tragic figures are the conduit for the audience, with Sally being the fantasy side of things and Brian being the reality. As with CHICAGO, although a little less so here, the musical numbers don't just move the story along (all while being organic) but also comment upon it as well. This, for me, is what sets Kander/Ebb musicals apart from the rest. Nazism begins as a mere nuisance but, as the film progresses, becomes more of a presence (and present threat). This is mirrored in the pacing of musical sequences which are initially spaced out a little sparsely but become more frequent as the film goes on. From an interpretive standpoint (and this is just my opinion), this implies (through the nature of what a cabaret is and entails) that our willingness to be entertained and distracted, even if only temporarily, is what allows political extremism/tragedy/etc. to insidiously take hold. No scene in CABARET is more chilling than when the young Nazi starts singing (what I think is) a folk song, and his audience gradually joins in with him. In fact, this entire musical is filled with pathos of varying types, which is why I think it's so effective. The cabaret is a metaphor for the ways we try to mask our pain, to find happiness, but it often comes at the expense of our dignity. From a technical perspective, all of the performances were solid with special marks being given to the leads. However, Joel Grey as the Master of Ceremonies was just as entertaining, perhaps the most so as his role provided dramatic and musical unity to the film. He was also simply hilarious to watch. There was also dynamite editing, choreography, lighting, etc., making it a sort-of ancestor to the music video. If there's one complaint I can levy, it's that the film takes a little too much time to get going, although once it gets into gear it doesn't let up. All things considered, CABARET is a stunning accomplishment that still holds relevance in this day and age of disillusionment with the political establishment. I'm a little hesitant to draw parallels between the America of today and the Germany of then, but it's a little disconcerting to feel like the only thing keeping us from making the same mistakes is that we've never suffered the abject humiliation that Germany suffered at the end of WWI. On a more positive note, CABARET exists as a testament to the power of entertainment, and definitely deserves its status as one of the best musicals ever put to film.",

We never see him out of his MC persona, but do see two layers to his performances.  As the host of an interwar Berlin burlesque, he is on one level-and perhaps for him it is the only level-an entertainer for Nazi fat cats and wealthy Yanks and Brits on continental vacations.  But art imitates life, and we can also see, perhaps all too plainly, how the songs that the MC presents are mirroring events in the world outside the club.  The Nazi party's growing boldness is displayed through rapid cuts between mob violence in the streets and the MC's cartoonish goosestepping on stage.  The unusual love triangle between Liza Minelli's hopeful actress and her British and German paramours has its telling parallel in the song \"Two Girls.\"  Most shockingly and ambiguously, the MC lampoons anti-Jewish miscegenation laws by romancing a person in a gorilla suit and asking why society should stand in the way of their love.  Would the Nazi party view this routine as an endorsement of their policies, since the idea of a human and a gorilla in love is patently foolish, or would they understand that the fool MC's question had truly moved the audience in spite of the veneer of absurdist comedy?  The music of \"Cabaret\" underlines the plot points in very bold strokes, but it works because everything is so unabashedly theatrical.  Matching Joel Grey's achievement and far outshining a weak turn from Michael York, Liza Minnelli gives a great performance, particularly in the songs \"Mein Herr\" and the title tune.",

Liza worked at a lounge where entertainment was given by singing and dancing but it was all relevant to the pot and the fact that singing and dancing naturally occurs there.  This point alone made the singing highly tolerable accompanied by the fact that the songs were funny and satirical, and even very serious and important at times.

Brian will encounter Sally, a very excentric American lady living in Berlin and working as a show lady in a cabaret.

My very first Bob Fosse's film, certainly the film gained its classic fame as the biggest winner of the Oscar in 1973, with 8 wins (including BEST DIRECTOR, LEADING ACTRESS and SUPPORTING ACTOR) and nearly usurped the BEST PICTURE trophy from THE GODFATHER (1972, 9/10), if it had been so,  it would be inflicted with much notorious backfire in the film history, but the film itself is an unerring gem among the undying musical genre, my first viewing is a thoroughly exultant experience, and cut and dried, it's on my guilty-pleasure list. \n\nIt is my first Liza Minnelli's film as well, the cabaret's \"international sensation\" Sally Bowles, an innocuous vamp, Liza grants her role a disarming vitality and quaintly resembles a bobbed Anne Hathaway doppelg\u00e4nger, not only radiates her grandeur in rendering her doughty-yet-alluring show tunes (she is born to do it), her portrayal of Sally personal life is equally (if not more) affecting, her doe-eyed naivety and unrestrained zest for life, for love, for fame elevate her character as the master of her own fate, her sacrifice may not gain concurrence from motley views of life, but a full obeisance to her independence and pluck is duly earned. \n\nMichael York, behind his gawky effeminacy, plunges himself into a more contentious venture, Brian Roberts, his character's bookish bi-sexual temperament is a provocative taboo on big screen (like since ever) and the implicit m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois temptation (with Sally and the suave Helmut Griem, whose gentrified debonair is utterly irresistible) has been simmering to the perfect temperature, undergirds a manifestation of initiating a sex-liberation wave (germane to the 70s era while against the Nazi-rising milieu in the film). \n\nThere is a subplot dealing with a bromide of a down-and-out German guy's infatuation with a rich but prude Jewish girl, there is an ironic twist near the end, however never quite manages to steal the limelight from Sally and Bri, but Marisa Berenson's placid performance is still worthy of backslapping (the dichotomy of women's images is a trifle stale though). \n\nJoel Grey, as the so called \"Master of Ceremonies\" and won an Oscar (against three fellows from THE GODFATHER), serves only as the performer in the film, no clear attachment with the plot, his musical set pieces are burlesque, risqu\u00e9 but entertaining to the bone, with a strenuous mimicry of German accent, it is a hard-earned honour, although I don't understand how Al Pacino could lose at any rate. \n\nThe film drops its curtain right before the prevalence of  Nazi's atrocity, the ending with the vague reflections of Third Reich audience occupying the place has sublimated the materialistic razzle-dazzle onto an eerily ominous scope which the film has no interest to tamper but the audiences will intuit what will happen next.

It's an absolute triumph of a film that contains such ambitious camera angles, they would look most appropriate in a full scale epic, but the fact they are mostly used in tiny rooms such as an apartment and a dingy Cabaret club gives the film a feel of greatness in a small place and gives an enormous feel of ambition to the film.

The cabaret she sings in represents all she wants life to be: easy sexuality, relaxed morality, eternal youth, and a place where her dreams are safe from the realistic skepticisms of the outside world. The dramatic irony is that we recognize the growing power of the Nazi party means that her fantasy is not to last. We don't need to see what beomces of Sally to know that she's doomed herself. \nFosse's ingenious staging practically makes the camera one of the dancers, invigorating the musical asides that colour the subtext of the narrative.

Joel Grey is fantastic as the over the top Master of Ceremonies and Liza Minnelli is great as Sally Bowles. I realized in watching them why playing a role over the top can work; it's because both of their characters are naturally larger than life characters, that going the extra step up works for them, and they both deserved their Academy Awards. Michael York as Brian Roberts is worth mentioning; he was so good that at times I forgot he was Basil Exposition from the Austin Powers movies. That, of course, was a joke but he still did a great job. His character was well handled from a writing standpoint. You actually did feel for what he was going through; at first being a loner in a new land and being constantly in a state of confusion and then as his relationship with Sally begins his jealousy of Maximillian. I love how the music isn't there to just serve the plot. Besides being entertaining to watch, they connect to the actual plot and it works very well in my opinion. If there's something I have to complain about in romances in movies, it's the lack of chemistry. In this movie, watching the chemistry between Brian and Sally is just fun to watch; it's so cute and real it's enjoyable to watch. As I mentioned earlier, the scenes in the cabaret are extremely entertaining, especially with Joel Grey and occasionally Liza there as well. The film also know how to act in certain scenes. It knew how to be ridiculous in the cabaret scenes, and when it was being dramatic, it was natural; it wasn't forced at all. In the \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" Nazi part, it was clever irony there. The film, however, is not without it's issues. The chemistry between Fritz and Natalia was rather underdeveloped (by the way it was very tragic to see her dog dead on her porch) and kinda thrown to the side, the fact that Brian was helping with English lessons and that he was translating a book for someone was kinda thrown away, the fact that he had gotten the shit beaten out of him by the Nazis but in the next few scenes seems perfectly fine, and the fact that Brian is bisexual is thrown away as well. Although they were issues, they didn't keep me from enjoying the film. The overarching theme of the Nazi Party I thought was well handled; again, it didn't feel forced when it was happening. As for the ending, it was so weirdly handled, but it fit the tone of the movie so I didn't mind it that much. Overall, I honestly have to say that although I'll need to watch it a second time to make sure, Cabaret might be my favorite musical.",

However, pic is too often content to settle for a rather humdrum storyline, and many of the musical numbers are far from memorable and add nothing to the story. A subplot involving a Jewish heiress adds little to the film and perhaps over-emphasises the Nazi backdrop, which might have worked better had it hung like an unmentioned specter over the proceedings. Some scenes suffer from a similar lack of subtlety, such as one in which a Aryan boy corrals a sympathetic crowd with a nationalistic tune that soon has many amongst them on their feet and singing along; though it initially appears to offer a perverse reflection of a similar scene in Casablanca, it's let down by a few rather heavy handed touches, such as Michael York's obvious proclamation that they won't be as hard to suppress as his friend Maximillian seems to think.",

The end result is a film that seems inconclusive.After not liking All That Jazz, my expectations for Cabaret were realistic. I knew that it was possible Bob Fosse's directing style was simply not something I was programmed to enjoy. The end result is a film that seems inconclusive. Definitely more up my alley than All That Jazz, Cabaret is still not a film I would quite say I liked. More-or-less, it is an above average musical (in my books) that has some positives and some drawbacks that leave it being a pretty muddled and mixed bag at the end of the day.First, the negatives. Though La La Land has come under fire for its weak or bad singing from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, it is abundantly clear to myself that both Stone and Gosling turn in better singing performances than Liza Minnelli and especially Joel Grey in Cabaret. Neither impress, instead turning in bland performances of bland songs such as \"Money, Money\" or \"Two Ladies\" (for Grey). Yes, both are legends - especially Minnelli - but neither really struck me as being worthy of the praise they receive for this film on the singing side of things. Minnelli is largely ineffectual and lacks the punch needed for these musical numbers, instead just feeling quite robotic and missing the gravitas necessary to pull of the songs. Fortunately for her, this is not all her fault as some of the song performed in the cabaret are just very bad. Some have great lyrics and melodies, other are just overtly risque for no other value. The former are exclusively songs with Minnelli. The latter are reserved for Grey who is just flat-out grating to watch. He is too exuberant and boisterous. His singing is comically bad throughout and seems to be played out for laughs with his weird lip movements than for any actual singing ability. If people say Gosling is bad in La La Land, then Grey needs his due for being a bad singer in Cabaret. By the end of the film, however, my favorite song was the one not including either of them and given that they were the stars and the main attractions on the musical side, this seems quite alarming.Second, the editing is quite bad. Just as in All That Jazz, Fosse goes cut happy at points. Jumping rapidly from one image to the next, the film just turns into a blur at parts. While it is supposed to represent the speed at which everything is occurring, it unfortunately has the side effect of rendering those moments entirely unwatchable and distracting. All That Jazz had the same issue with these rapid cuts that distract more than they enhance. It is clearly a style employed by Fosse that simply does not work in my view. While not too plentiful, the moments are bad enough and occur often enough to be worth mentioning. Other than these, the editing is fine. Nothing great and nothing awful. It cuts when it should and is quite cohesive as a final product, but those few moments unfortunately leave a lot to be desired.In the mixed, not a pro and not a con, section we have the film's sexuality. Openly confronting society's reservations about open sexuality, LGBT persons, and various other sexual taboos, Cabaret is a crucially important film. It shows that those who cross dress, are trans, are gay, are bi, or are lesbians, are just people too. They want to have fun, they cry, they want to love, and they want to laugh all the same. Cabaret, for this, is boundary shattering. It is impressively open about these topics to the point that it may be too much. Mind you, I am not saying it is too risque or that I am a prude. Rather, it feels as though the film tries too hard to push these boundaries. It includes so many topics and, by the end, it feels like the film is just sitting there and judging the audience for not accepting like one of those SNL sketches about high school theatre with the film screaming out, \"This is normal and your world view is small.\" While I agree with its message of acceptance against its backdrop of the rise in Nazism, it feels like it pours it on a bit thick.On the positive side of things, some songs really stand out. Though I criticized Minnelli and Grey before, allow me to walk some of those comments back in praising some of their songs. For Grey, \"If You Could See Her\" is beautifully sung, catchy, and incredibly entertaining. It is also thematically relevant with a great take on accepting a person for who they are and not just judging a book by its cover. For Minnelli, \"Mein Herr\" and \"Maybe This Time\" are real standouts. The former features solid singing, but tremendous choreography by Fosse. The latter is gorgeously written with a great mournful and longing delivery by Minnelli on the vocal side of things. Yet, bar none, the highlight of the film is \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\". Absolutely chilling to watch be sung by a boy in a Nazi uniform and joined in by similar white people, the sequence is brilliantly put together by Fosse and haunting. The singing and lyrics are terrific, but the moment it signifies is the real highlight and shows the perfect blend of music",

Its obviously depicting a form of escapism while set in an especially bleak place given the time its set in (Germany, during the 1930s). The plot is interesting enough, so I'd say its worth a watch, if it interests you, yes, although its by no means all glitter and glamour based, as there are some dark-ish themes covered, not least due to the time its set in.",
