            "content": "Director Luis Bunuel is often described as a surrealist, but the word misapplied in reference to his later works, where the the term absurdism is much more appropriate. Such is the case with the Academy Award-winning THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, which begins with four friends who arrive at their hosts' home only to discover they have arrived on the wrong night--a plausible situation. But before the film has run its course, Bunuel unravels his tale of a meal that never quite happens in the most unexpected ways imaginable.The film works on several levels, mocking social conventions, the church, and eventually spilling its action into a series of overlapping nightmares in which various attempts to dine are frustrated by everything from the corpse of a restaurant manager in a nearby room to military maneuvers. On one memorable occasion, the friends are invited to dine and are seated around an elegant table--when a curtain suddenly rises behind them and reveals them to be seated on a stage before a hostile audience! The cast (which features Fernando Rey, Delphine Seyrig, Paul Frankeur, Bulle Ogier, Stephane Audran and Jean-Pierre Cassel as the constantly frustrated diners) plays with considerable aplomb, performing the most irrational scenes with a magnificent realism. When combined with Bunuel's absurdist story, the result is a disquieting yet often very funny discourse on frustrated appetites both real and imagined, and with many layers of incidental meaning along the way.A word of caution to the uninitiated: Bunuel is not for those who seek a tidy plot line with clear-cut meanings. But if you come to it with an open mind, you'll find plenty of food for thought!Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

            "content": "In Paris, the ambassador Don Rafael Acosta (Fernando Rey) of the South American country Miranda, who is also an smuggler of cocaine, comes to a dinner part in the house of Henri (Jean-Pierre Cassel) and Alice S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (Stephane Audran) with their common friends M. Thevenot (Paul Frankeur), his wife Simone Th\u00e9venot (Delphine Seyrig) and her sister Florence (Bulle Ogier) but on the day before the scheduled. Henri is not at home and they invite Alice to go with them to a restaurant close to her house, but an incident does not allow them to have meal together in the place. They reschedule another meal together many times, but problems occur in every occasion and they do not succeed in their intent.\"Le Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie\" is one of the funniest movies of the master of the surrealism Luis Bu\u00f1uel. This intellectual director was a great critic of the values of the Bourgeoisie Class and this movie is a witty joke, blurring the fears this class with reality and nightmare, and open to the most different interpretations. The empty, hypocrite and pointless existence of the Bourgeoisie Class is highlighted by the shallow interest of the characters in meal, sex, etiquette and money and their final journey to nowhere; or the behavior of the disloyal ambassador that betrays his friend having a love affair with his wife; smuggles cocaine using his diplomatic immunity; or shoots the toy of a terrorist in front of the Embassy of Miranda. Further, in 1972, the countries of South America lived under military dictatorship with many exiled people living in Paris, and the arrogant Don Rafael Acosta is hilarious denying the truth about his country. Bu\u00f1uel does not spare the church in his satire, with the funny Monsignor Dufour trying to interfere in every subject without the appropriate knowledge. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"O Discreto Charme da Burguesia\" (\"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\")",

            "content": "This is an odd little film about some people who never do get to sit down to the meal they plan on having. A lot of weird and unexpected stuff intervenes--during which you learn a little more about the characters (particularly how unlikeable some of them are). The problem I had with the movie is this--it just wasn't very interesting and I repeatedly felt like turning it off because I found it more boring than compelling. Now this is not because of the surreal nature of the film--I have a relatively high tolerance for the strange and unconventional (just look at my glowing review for the VERY surreal Happiness of Katakuris). It's just that strange as it was, it just wasn't too interesting nor was it weird enough to make that great an impression. I know it puts me in a very small minority, but most of the Luis Bu\u00f1uel films I have seen were not that compelling--odd yes, but not particularly interesting. About the only one I really liked was the sad film \"Tristan\".UPDATE: I've seen most of the director's films since I wrote this review. I did find several (other than \"Tristan\") that I really did like. However, I still think he had about as many hits as misses and feel he was a bit overrated. But, films like \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"The Young One\" are indeed exceptional films.",

            "content": "The title is certainly intriguing, suggesting something ultra sophisticated, and we can guess that 'discreet' will be exposed as 'hypocritical,' and the charm will be superficial. In this we are not disappointed. I should also say this reminds me of the theater of the absurd that had its heyday in the postwar period in Europe and the US with Rhinoceros, Six Characters in Search of an Author, Waiting For Godot, The Birthday Party, etc., and then more or less disappeared, Roberto Benigni's recent cinematic venture, La Vita e Bella (1997) notwithstanding. Most critics however would refer to this work as an example of surrealism, an aesthetic movement in art, theater, cinema, etc. that grew out of Dadaism in the twenties. But the theater of the absurd is later, taking its rationale from the existential work of Camus--see especially his collection of essays, The Myth of Sisyphus (1942)--and Sartre, while getting its name from a book entitled, The Theatre of the Absurd (1960) by Martin Esslin. Regardless of how we tag this, Spanish/French director Luis Bu\u00f1uel's treatment is indeed charming and funny.Fernando Rey stars as a diplomat from the country of 'Miranda' who, along with his five constant friends, cannot seem to ever finish a meal. They are the bourgeoisie who are discreet in their sexual activities and their illegalities (Rey's character apparently smuggles cocaine) while maintaining a sort of absurd decorum in which good manners are paramount. A caf\u00e9 runs out of tea, well, they will content themselves with coffee. No coffee, well, water will be fine. Guests arrive a day ahead of time, well, we'll go out instead, won't you join us. When a company of soldiers on maneuvers shows up at the house just as they are sitting down to dinner, they are invited to join them, and when the police come to arrest Rey, they all politely intercede only to follow him to jail. When the one finds that his wife is in his friend's bedroom, he is too polite to object.Bu\u00f1uel's technique runs realistic scenes into dream sequences without warning. When a soldier sits down to tea to tell his story of horror, all listen politely. When, for the umpteenth time they are \u00e0 la table, a curtain parts and they find themselves on stage in front of an audience, they discreetly excuse themselves, saying they have forgotten their lines.Of course Bu\u00f1uel must have his little satire of the church, and here he uses a monseigneur who becomes a gardener who hears a last rites confession that reveals that the confessor murdered his, the monseigneur's, parents many years ago. The monseigneur politely and without being ruffled, allows that Jesus forgives him and leaves him in a state of grace, which soothes his conscience as he then picks up a shotgun....So seamlessly does Bu\u00f1uel weave his tapestry, that it's sometimes hard to tell when reality ends and the dreams begin, but that is perhaps the point. Our dreams are absurd of course, but then again so is our reality.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "A satire on everyone who's too big for their boots (or secretly wants 2 B), because they will not achieve the aims they pursuit and are ultimately doomed to be separated from their privileges when they wake up to reality. The story may also come across as remote parody on The Last Supper, but from the bourgeois point of view (who never really get their supper), in contrast with 'Viridiana' (1961, Bu\u00f1uel), where the poor and disabled DO get their Last Supper.  But I don't know much about the bible, so I'm probably wrong about that.  It proves though that you don't have to be pious to appreciate Bu\u00f1uel's films; in fact, you'd better NOT be.The 'adventure' of the protagonists is a proverbial sinking ship, because they seem to know what they want, but never reach their goal, which is quite simple and basic (to eat), because they're so caught up in supposed etiquette.  They have all kinds of knowledge about manners and gestures, but they cannot sit down and eat.  That is actually a fairly clear message: 'look before you leap' or 'behold the priorities of life'.What's more indiscrete: drinking a martini the wrong way, or selling cocaine abusing your position as an ambassador and fooling around in the garden while you're having friends over for diner?  And are you ultimately discrete simply because nobody discovers your subversive or criminal actions?  These guys just can't control their carnal and financial lust, while complaining: 'No system can give the masses the proper social graces. But you know me, I'm not a reactionary.' Blah.Cinematographer Edmond Richard (Le Proc\u00e8s (1963, Welles), Fant\u00f4me de la libert\u00e9, Cet obscur objet du d\u00e9sir) exhibits his excellent collaboration with Bu\u00f1uel's visions.  Bu\u00f1uel tried before to make it easier for audiences to understand the imagery by incorporating it in a dream sequence (e.g. Tristana, 1970), but he returns here (as in Belle de Jour, 1967) to the early days (1930) where the dream sequences were just put forward as if they were reality.  You'll never know what is a dream and what is real.  As always, there is no music here to guide you, apart from the ringing church bells.  Just open up your ears and clean out your eyes and you'll not be disappointed.One last remark: the cover of the video is definitely one of the most applicable and distinctive covers (Ferracci) ever made, as is the cover of 'Fant\u00f4me de la libert\u00e9' (an odd-faced statue of liberty with a limp torch) by Jean-Paul Commandeur and the cover of 'Cet obscur objet du d\u00e9sir'. Bu\u00f1uel didn't worry about the surrealism in his own life.  He seemed to live in harmony with all his contradictions and hypocrisy.10 points out of 10 :-)",

            "content": "Bunuel is arguably the greatest of all filmmakers. With the possible exceptions of Hitchcock and Fassbinder, I can think of no other director who so completely understood the potential of the medium to transcend the traditional conventions of narrative, or exploited this potential with such \u00e9lan. And he doesn't rely on special effects: we enter the surreal realm so seamlessly that it at times seems banal. This is especially the case in 'Le charme': banal people have banal sub-consciousnesses.In order to begin to appreciate Bunuel I had to immerse myself in his milieu, so foreign was his sensibility to the usual expectations I had brought with me into a movie theater.It took me several viewings to get the 'jokes' if 'Le charme'. The Ambassador from some obscure Latin American country ('Miranda', or 'wonder', a nod to Shakespeare), supports this little microcosm of comfortable Parisian bourgeois respectability with cocaine smuggled in diplomatic pouches. Guests arrive for a dinner party on the wrong evening, and interrupt the hosts having sex. A wake is being held in the back room of the restaurant they are planning to dine at. Ice cubes for martinis must be 'exactly zero degrees'. Elegant ladies sit down for a fashionable afternoon tea, only to be told by their waiter that the restaurant has run out of water (?!!). A soldier then comes to their table and relates his parricidal dream, while the polite ladies listen to him unfazed. One of the ladies discreetly slips away for an assignation with another one's husband. Only Bunuel! Doubtless the inspiration for this film comes from the Latin Bunuel's lifetime of experience observing the French in situ. Much of its fun comes from simply watching the French be so . . . French. And there is no bourgeois like a French bourgeois! Much of 'Le Charme' takes place in the nightmares of its characters: you are sitting down for a dinner being hosted by a general, only to realize that you are on stage (with a prompter giving a cue from Don Juan: 'Invite the commander's ghost for dinner!'); your elegant dinner party is broken up by a gang of thugs looking to kill you. However, you are so wedded to the ceremony of the dinner party that you get caught stealing a piece of meat from the table under which you are hiding (and end up dying like a dog!) I could see this movie a hundred times and always find something new. I would never be bored by it.Bunuel is very funny, but he is also dense and difficult. One doesn't realize the true complexity of his films because they all seem so effortless. Nothing great comes easily. He's like great Bordeaux: you can't quaff it -- it demands to be sipped.Bunuel is famous for having the lowest shoot to take ratio of any filmmaker, less than 2:1. Second takes were rare (compare with the reams that end up on the cutting room floor for the typical Spielberg film.) He knew exactly what he wanted to see before he shot. Hitchcock, a director who resembles Bunuel in many ways, famously referred to actors as 'cattle'. For Bunuel, they were probably more like toy soldiers. This isn't to say that he didn't get brilliant performances out of them, especially from his screen alter-ego, the wonderful Fernando Rey.Henry Miller dubbed his good friend Luis Bunuel \"The Last Heretic\". I can't think of a higher compliment. Bunuel's memoirs, 'My Last Sigh', are a must read for anyone who wants to have an appreciation of Paris in the 20s, the of art in the last century, and martinis, made as they should be, with gin.",

Bu\u00f1uel, who also co-authored the screenplay with Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re, at times gently skewers the hungry wealthy; his characters are not decadent nor lazy, perhaps just comically fettered; the filmmaker doesn't score points against their lives as much as he prods the folly of their ways. The lapses of reality into a satirical daisy-chain of dreams is surprising at first but finally monotonous, especially as Bu\u00f1uel becomes less sly here and more mean-spirited (I could have done without the police interrogation and the piano torture). Still, there are some marvelous visual touches (such as the dinner table on-stage) accompanied by a subtle yet vivid use of color, and the cast is uniformly excellent.

The dinner party is the movie's main setting and it is there that reality and illusion often times blend imperceptibly together. The film is structured as a series of surreal sequences, which prompted esteemed film critic Pauline Kael to opine 'His(Director Louis Bunuel) indifference to dramatic logic is complete.' And how. Bunuel's narrative plays an elaborate game with the viewer through it's subconscious imagery and audacious use of time. His tendency to experiment with technique and form often times led to discovery and innovation.                                                            The cinema of Louis Bunuel invariably deals with the discrepancy between appearance and reality; decorum and desire. His world view was subversive and anarchistic. He was a cheerful pessimist, skeptical but not susceptible to Bergmanian despair. His skepticism extended to all of those he found playing too neat a social game. The filmmaker's career was one sustained assault on authoritarianism. Witness an indiscreet character in the film who claims: 'No one system can help the masses acquire refinement.' He believed man was, unconsciously, a slave to custom and aimed to shock viewers out of their unthinking acceptance of established values. \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\"(An Academy Award winner in 1972 for Best Foreign Film) is a boldly inventive picture. Dozens of frames are filled with clever filmic devices: environmental noises increase inordinately during routine conversations; an ambiguous procession is inserted freely within the text. These cinematic ploys add intrigue to the already peculiar goings-on. The walk by the main group of characters along a country roadside is mysterious and compelling. The players are noticeably silent and contemplative. Is this an anxious dream? The afterlife? An insignificant flashback? Whichever, the recurring sequence underscores the obliqueness and cool obscurity of the film. One might not identify closely with the disenchanted Bunuelian sensibility or the unsentimental stance he takes, however one knows immediately and unmistakably that they are in the gifted hands of a film technician like a Godard or Kurosawa. A director in complete control of his medium. A highly personal filmmaker frequently referred as 'a poet of hallucination who follows the caprices of his fantastical imagination.' Someone whose fanciful paths of creation were invariably led by the irrational. \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\", with it's arresting mixture of calculation and carelessness, remains a unique and influential movie. The acerbic films of Robert Altman and the perverse mischievousness of the Coen brothers films, to mention but a few, pay a large debt to the strange universe and unconventional perspective of Louis Bunuel. Film lovers uninitiated in surrealist cinema will find \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" an alluring and beguiling crash course.",

To crown everything, the characters accept the events, no matter how weird things get! Fernando Rey, hot off playing one of the villains in \"The French Connection\", plays a diplomat from the fictional Latin American country of Miranda*. People address him about the gap between rich and poor, and about his government's use of excessive force against protesters, and meanwhile a terrorist (revolutionary?) follows him everywhere. He comes across as a slimy guy, but you can't help but admire him.The scene where everyone walks towards an unspecified location seems to reflect the lives that this bunch of people leads in general.

Of course, there is always the possibility that the problems lie in their minds. Is it Freudian or Jungian or what?

The women are snobbish and sensual, cold and calculating; one is a drunk. The men are involved in illegal activities and seem to pay a great price. Or do they? That's the issue. They seem to be saddled with guilt. Every so often, a non-sequitir comes along, stops whatever plot has developed, and another dinner is served. A young lieutenant tells the tale of a double murder of his parents and his vengeance. Soldiers appear at dinner. Police arrest them. They are unscathed.

(As if we need the likes of him telling us that, of course.) Naturally, that didn't prevent him from liking it (or at least he claims he does), because, after all, the GREAT WIZARD OF European CINEMA Bunuel HIMSELF made this glorious masterpiece. How can it not be terrific??? Or is that \"a master piece of crap\"?...TDCOTB is a self-indulgent collection of scenes, which bored me to the most part. Bunuel's left-wing anti-Americanism/anti-Capitalism was pathetic, as was the very bland and ugly look of the movie. (No doubt some pro-Bunuelists would say now that this was done on purpose because the main characters are so bland and ugly as well, or some such unconvincing malarkey\u0085) Bunuel hates Nazis, but adores mass-killers like Mao. He portrays terrorists as young, good-looking idealists, and not the psychopathic degenerates that they really are.Bunuel's contempt for the \"Bourgeoisie\" i.e. his tender love and caring for the \"proletariat\" is truly touching, I had so many handkerchiefs ready so as not to drown in my own pool of tears. The greatest irony, of course, is that this \"proletariat\" COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT HIS MOVIES. They are not the ones who watch his movies, but UPPER AND MIDDLE-CLASS ART STUDENTS. Isn't that a wonderful irony, almost like poetic justice, so fitting for this senile old hypocrite.Anyone who condones large-scale Marxist violence i.e. mass-murder in gulags, while passionately advocating revolution against fascist regimes (or what he considers to be such) lacks any kind of moral foundation to preach to ANYONE \u0096 let alone me.But let's forget the blatant and embarrassingly na\u00efve left-wing politics that lurk in every other scene of this mediocre non-feast. The movie is mostly dull. The soldier's dream, for example: what was the point of that? If I ever had such a dull dream I wouldn't even tell it to my most bored friends \u0096 let alone put it in a movie for millions to watch! Or how about that lieutenant's story? Why did he approach the three women? Just to tell them about how he poisoned his step-father? That sequence doesn't fit into the movie at all; Bunuel seems to have literally SHOVED IT into the plot, by sheer force. \"Let's see, I have this nice little pointless childhood revenge-poison story that I wrote in 3 minutes\u0085 Where shall I put it? Oh well, nevermind, I can put it anywhere. After all, the film will have no flow, so who cares where I stick it?\" The endless series of \"it-was-just-a-dream\" twists get rather tiresome after a while \u0096 not to mention predictable. The movie is repetitious. What about that supposedly very clever \"they-never-get-to-eat\" theme/running-gag? I would laugh at it if only I didn't know beforehand what real humour was. If I want to watch absurdist humour on a high level I'll put in a Monty Python disk. Bunuel's movies aren't funny. And often they aren't even clever.The only scene that was both original and interesting was when the 6 characters find themselves eating on a stage. (Or TRYING TO EAT \u0096 ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. So so very funny, them not getting to eat because they keep getting interrupted\u0085 Hilarious\u0085 Oh, I nearly wet myself\u0085) No wonder this movie won the Best Foreign Picture Oscar!",

            "review_title": "Funny surrealism that strikes conventions and fashions",
            "content": "The systematic analysis of this film would be in my opinion a gigantic task, since there are so many topics, stories and references intermingled in the chaotic way the surrealists are so fond of. I think the two main topics -sometimes in surrealism there is not even one- are dreams and transgression of social norms and traditions. The film is articulated on linked-up situations: five gatherings of a group of bourgeois friends and four stories, four dreams which are dreamt by different characters. The suppers are more common in the first part of the film, and the dreams on a second part, but they alternate with each other and with other episodes, like that of the terrorist girl. At the beginning things seem not to turn out good: right the first thing we see is the perplexity of the guests to M. Senechal house when they are told the supper was planned for the next day. 'But that is impossible', says Acosta, 'I couldn't have accepted, tomorrow I'm busy'. Contradiction with no explanation, right the same way as things happens in a dream, where we accept the reality of what we dream without explanations, even if it is impossible or contradictory with something else -dreams are the core of surrealism and of this film. This baffling beginning really impressed me. There is contradiction and kind of a difficulty to do things in every single detail in the next sequence: Mme and M Senechal are invited to dine out, but she has to change. The restaurant 'n'a pas l'air gai', and the door is locked. They knock and they are invited in. The owners have changed. There is no people and the prices are cheap. Everything is suspicious. And then the first punch of the story: the manager died that afternoon and the wake has been set in the dining room since the undertaker has not yet arrived. Of course, the bourgeois leave. This is the first reference to death, a constant theme either in surrealism, in dreams and in this film. It seems as if the whole film was a dream. Within the context things are logical and normal -or seem logical and normal- to the characters, and their reactions are 'contextually' logical too, but from the outside the stories in the film are as odd as any dream we can have. E.g., when Acosta shoots the terrorist girl from his window, or when the army appeared at M. Senechal's house, or even when the bishop tells M Senechal that he wants to be the family gardener. They are baffled, but they accept the things that happen, as we are baffled by or dreams but accept their logic when we are dreaming. Social transgression is based on a subtle but scorning parody of the bourgeois class and their customs and beliefs. The bourgeois are classy, and conceited: they show off their vain culinary knowledge every time they host a supper. M. Thevenot boasts that 'discreet charm' of the bourgeois when he subtly makes fun of the chauffeur: he does not know how to drink a Martini. Later on, Acosta cheats on Thevenot when he tells him that he has to show his wife the 'sursiks'. Thevenot does not know what that is, but he is an hypocrite not to say it. The bourgeois are also extremely fond of the lowest vices and they enjoy them gaily -I do not think, on the other side, that Bu\u00f1uel is condemning them, but the hypocritical attitude of the bourgeoisie. Drug trafficking and consumption, lust, alcohol. The commentaries about the younger girl vomiting and dirty nails and her ignorance (the complex of Euclides, she says at some point) point out -and laugh at- the hypocrisy in the values of the middle-high classes. Also the Church and the Army are criticized. The Bishop, a main head of the Church, is humble -a extremely acid irony- but will mercilessly kill a poor man that will die anyway -that adds to the cruelty. The Bishop is also ignorant: he does not know where the Republic of Miranda is. The soldiers and officers smoke marihuana and praise it, they even are connoisseurs! -'Mexico or Congo?', the general asks, referring to the origins of the product.. The dreams come over mainly in the second part of the film. Both the two first of them are dreamt by soldiers. I really enjoyed them. In the first one I see a little bit of a reference of the life in Spain on the times when Bu\u00f1uel was a kid -I do not know Bu\u00f1uel's early life in Spain, but I presume there could be some autobiography. The looks of the parents of the young soldier, their clothes and the strict, militarist attitude of the father made me think of the Spanish family life in the turn of the century XIX to XX. I also liked the second dream. The dark and blurry street and house and the background noise make a great dreamy scene. In this dream, the soldier meets a dead friend. Then another friend comes over, and makes him realize that it is impossible. Sometimes in real dreams this happens too. Something happens and then, with no explanation, we realize that is impossible. It also should be pointed out that these two dreams share two primal human topics: motherly feelings and fear to death. The topic of death is present in some other dreams: the general's, in which Acosta shoots him dead; or the dream about the ghost of the sergeant. Another primal fear is dealt with in Senechal's dream: shame. They are caught in a theater stage while they are having dinner -this is a recurrent dream that sometimes takes other forms: being naked in the middle of the street or lying on your bed wearing you pajamas in your classroom. I also found humor all over the film: funny situations such as the bishop offering himself as a gardener, or the straws in M. and Mme. Senechal hair. Acosta playing tricks on Thevenot, or the soldiers happily smoking joints and listening to a 'sympa' dream. But I do not know if Bu\u00f1uel is trying to be funny or only to transgress. And that transgression is hilarious because it reveals the hypocrisy of society.",

            "content": "Somewhere within the miles of celluloid, Luis Bunuel could be heard snickering to himself as he put these hapless socialites through the most absurd situations as he made them, in a parallel world, walk through fields of green down a road that seems to lead to somewhere but proves to be a road to nowhere.Isn't it an overwhelming experience to meet a director's work just at the moment he's at his peak form? The exhilaration of letting his vision come through to you, invade your senses, and make the exact connections, has to be of the most intimate kind -- mind to heart. If and when that happens, you can safely say you are in the hands of a master of visual storytelling.Luis Bunuel was seventy-two when he directed his Oscar-winning film LE CHARME DISCRET DE LA BOURGEOISIE. This is the age period when many directors tend to lose their touch and favor some excess baggage or poor storytelling in lieu of sharp execution. Virtually every director who has reached this late period in life and is still working has the tendency to suffer at the encroaching shadow of death. Just look at the work of Sidney Lumet, Woody Allen (who since MATCH POINT is on his way back to form), Kubrick's last movie EYES WIDE SHUT, to name a few.Not Bunuel. Right up untl his last movie -- CET OBSCUR OBJET DU DESIR -- he was razor-sharp, keen, and as subtle as a bulldozer, and that's why this film is one of his best and a fascinating work of art. The story of six socialites who can never seem to consummate a simple social act -- in this case, dining -- due to the most implausible of things is in one way a version of his 1962 film EL ANGEL EXTERMINADOR, but where in that film there was no way out of a house, here all of the characters are in constant freedom. That is, until Bunuel reveals his fangs and decides he's gotten tired of playing cat and mouse with this horrendously vapid, vicious people.Hearkening back to L'AGE D'OR, Bunuel revisits the themes he introduced in that film: couples needing to make love in their own garden, causing an uproar, or upright citizens committing crimes against defenseless people (in this case, a member of the clergy who gets reunited with the man who killed his parents and who pretends to absolve the dying man before shooting him in the head, a hysterical high point). One could argue that there seems to be no point in going around in circles... but then again, aren't the lives of these \"rich and famous\" equally pointless? Aren't these the kind of people who would look down at anyone who wasn't a part of their social circle? Aren't these the same people who, despite living a life of complacency, also have their own dabbling in the underbelly of society -- drug trade -- and have become the inevitable targets of terrorists who would rather eradicate them from the face of this Earth? Ironically, the Surrealist elements of the movie are less to be remembered due to the fact that they're not meant to shock as much as to be a part of the \"plot\", itself as absurd as a pie in the sky or a Magritte painting. A man is tortured with some odd device inside a piano as the camera pans away to show cockroaches pouring out from inside it, a slight nod to the odd piano sequence from UN CHIEN ANDALOU. The jailer is shown bleeding, at death's door, freeing the six socialites -- a nod to the bleeding man in L'AGE D'OR. A soldier tells his own story of discovering his father wasn't his father via his dead mother who appears in a way similar to the way ghosts tend to manifest themselves in Asian horror films. And of course, whenever there needs to be an logical explanation of things, Bunuel incorporates big, booming sounds, essentially telling us that he could care less of the machinations of things. Because after all, this is a man who was never at ease explaining films, and who made them because this was his way of expressing himself. And in making movies for himself, he made movies for the masses who could get his warped but irreverent view of humanity.",

To have people astounded by the \"brilliance\" of the film and the \"genius\" of Bunuel is to me astounding in itself. While someone like Fellini can entrance, Bunuel might have well produced a film based on alcoholic, drug-addicted ne'er-do-wells that said nothing worthwhile or did nothing worthwhile. A disjointed, badly acted, phony presentation of a group of individuals that are worth nothing yet somehow cunning enough (in the film) to elevate themselves to positions of importance. I found myself asking \"What is the point of this film?\" and the answer kept coming up \"There is no point and the whole production is absurd.\" Contrived and unrelated dream sequences that go nowhere. Actions by the actors that mean nothing and make no sense in any context. Perhaps because the majority of viewers are in the same category as the actors in the film, they can relate to it. I cannot. There is nothing worthwhile to be taken from this film. If one derives intellectual meaning from such as this, I feel sorry for them.My inner self insisted on adding the following: A knock came on the door of my subconscious. I opened it, and it was a vacuum cleaner salesman who pushed past me and sat down on my couch.\"Did you have an unhappy childhood?\" he asked, and continued without pause: \"I did. I used to have a recurring dream where I was walking down a road. Did you eat lunch? It is curious that it is not raining out, is it not?\" He then proceeded to begin a one-sided conversation of mechanical engineering from a feminist perspective. Without stopping after he had finished his discourse, he began to relate the mystical aspects of flatulence. Midway through this conversation, he stopped to say \"I'm sorry, I have to leave now. I have another appointment. Thank you for your order.\" And left, leaving the door open.",

            "content": "Luis Bunuel, and his occasional collaborator Jean-Claude Carriere, present us with six core characters in France, including Spaniard diplomat Don Raphael Acosta (Bunuel regular Fernando Rey, in a performance that can be certainly said fits perfectly with his character traits), the Thevenots (Paul Frankeur and Delphine Seyrig), the Senechals (Stephane Audran and Jean-Pierre Cassel), and Florence (Bulle Ogier), along with several supporting/side characters like a bishop who decides to be a gardener for the Senechals, a colonel, a cavalry lieutenant, a \"bloody\" sergeant, and a cute girl handing out mechanical dogs. The six core characters, we soon figure out, aren't going to give us any important information about their pasts (excepting minor notes of interest in brilliantly appropriate banal dialog), and beneath their elegance within their class of life are like us, sexual beings, hungry for food, and have the sort-of side jobs going that keep the money coming in (i.e. the cocaine). The main characters, if displayed in their daily routines for the course of the film, wouldn't hold the audience's attention long enough, and while Bunuel is famous for poking fun at the upper class, he knows even if he tried for a basic, true view of these people it would get boring, perhaps unbearable to the wrong viewer. However, he counter-acts this in the best he can, the way he knows how- he uses a technique in which the characters are often getting interrupted, in their meetings for dinner or other minor daily routines, by odd, obscure, mysterious, yet certainly human personalities that bring the viewer into the realm of intrigue and poetic artistry. Therefore, because Bunuel happens to have something of a fascinating with a Freudian approach to movie-making that can never pander to the audience (unless they're an overtly dense or stupid audience), after a while these characters walks of life become truly Bunuel-esque vignettes. Whether they're dream or reality becomes secondary, though not irrelevant, to the effect of our immersion is to the material, the images. Such images, like the ones in successful surrealist-student works like Eraserhead, Week-End, Natural Born Killers, and even Freddy Got Fingered, stay with us for days after the credits fade to black. The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is the second feature I have seen from the legendary surrealist writer, artist, sound man, and director Bunuel (the first was Un Chien Andalou, practically a pre-requisite in order to get into the catalog of his career), and I can tell right away that when I begin delving into his other works I'll have a lot to look for. Indeed, from my perspective, this is a hard act to follow, and it could be the quintessential Bunuel picture (in other words, a most recommended choice) unless I see something else of his that gives me greater respect. I'm sure in a couple of months or so I'll have my foot in my mouth over that sentence considering his works Belle De Jour and Nazarin are as equally acclaimed and revered. One thing I can't deny, this is an assured (European) masterpiece that will keep audience members either begging for more, or disgusted to the point of burning the video or DVD (even if they rented it from the store!)- and since that facet is one of the basic foundations of the surrealism movement, which many say never took off as it should have, this film is like a time capsule of the finest caliber of the remains of the movement. Let me put it this way: I believe this may get on my list of all-time favorites (1-50) soon enough. A++",

Also, the dream sequences are made exceptionally.The film satirizes french bourgeoisie but as I said it is not really an acid satire but a surreal comedy/drama that doesn't really have to make sense. Dream in dream sequences are often used to express the character's unrests and troubles. The movie is somehow similar to The Exterminating Angel where the characters, after they eat cannot leave the room even though there is nothing stopping them. Here, different situations interrupt the characters from eating. These situations are absurd and illogic, just like the ones in The Exterminating Angel.The situations are absolutely amazing and Bunuel once again makes a statement.

Basically the film consists of guests gathering for a dinner together, and this is intertwined with the individual characters having dreams about weird things happening at the dinner, making the latter of the film complex and virtual. The guests attending the dinner are Ambassador Don Rafael Acosta (Fernando Rey), Madame Simone Th\u00e9venot (Delphine Seyrig), M. Thevenot (Paul Frankeur) and Florence (Bulle Ogier), with the evening hosted by Alice S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (BAFTA nominated St\u00e9phane Audran) and her husband Henri (Jean-Pierre Cassel). You are not sure of all the scenes, apart from the obvious things, whether they are part of a dream or reality, as every time the upper-middle class people try to have their dinner something interrupts them. Events in the dinner attempts include dropped turkeys/chickens, the table appearing on a theatre stage in front of a live audience, dead characters walking around as blood-covered zombies, and heavily armed men storming in and killing everyone with machine guns. Also starring Julien Bertheau as Bishop Dufour, Claude Pi\u00e9plu as Colonel and Michel Piccoli as Home Secretary. Despite not knowing where to go and what was real in this film, I did find it an interesting watch, especially with the interruptions and bizarre scenarios, like the theatre and gun scenes, and the editing is certainly inventive, so I would say it is a worthwhile surreal comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced, and it won the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film.

No more explanation needed there, though I suppose some would argue that true surrealism is supposed to be so intellectually anarchistic the point is the lack of point.But that's not what this filmmaker tries. There's real satire attempted here. There's an attempt at folding, and some of the mirroring of images one finds elsewhere. There's some self-reference. There's some `explanation.'

With every scene, they get closer to eating something, but there's always something to complicate things. Bunuel constantly finds ways of ridding the possibility of eating, drinking or even getting comfortable in their seats at a dinner party or restauraunt. From dead bodies in the parlor of a restauraunt to a curtain opening and the lucky six being thrown to an angry audience, Bunuel is always finding ways to put the laugh on us perhaps. The use of the \"dream\" in this film is also quite interesting. Bunuel's characters dream what every individual is capable of or what other characters are capable of doing to them; murder, the past and their own death. (Wonderful sequence with 5 of the group gunned down by a machine gun and Rey sitting under the dinner table, only to reach his hand out to grab some meat...so he can finally eat something.) Won the Oscar for the Best Foreign Language Film of 1972, this is in intriguing film that also features excellent use of the camera and a series of \"travel shots,\" as I like to call it, as we see our group of friends walk aimlessly in search of a place to eat.",

            "content": "I'll be honest, I mostly like my movies to be conventional which simply means to me that they should have a beginning, middle and ending, plus a credible plot and believable characters. I've never cottoned on to the cinema of the surreal or the absurd and have always thought you can keep all that Coen Brothers or Pedro Almodovar stuff away from my door.But, I live in Spain now and I have a learned Spanish neighbour who has encouraged me to watch some Spanish cinema particularly the films of Bunuel and so a few months ago I made a point of watching his earlier work \"Viridiana\" which I very much enjoyed and deciding to dip into his repertoire again, selected this particular movie, even if it was produced in France, as it seems to be his best known and perhaps most celebrated work. So glad I did.Did I perceive every nuance of the director's intentions? Probably not. Did I understand the bigger arguments he was making, which to be fair is pretty much all there in the title? I think so though I can't be sure. Was I kept watching all the way through down to the delicious combination of intrigue, amusement and curiosity? Absolutely!The narrative is simple. Three male-female couples want to sit down to dinner in modern-day France. The males are all in some way connected to the governance of an imaginary French protectorate in South America called Miranda with the most prominent among them being Fernando Rey as the country's ambassador, but all six are of the distinctly upper class set.But don't be fooled into thinking that these suited and booted individuals are pillars of society. Far from it. As well as apparently having designs on each other's wives we also see that the three men are involved in the illegal trafficking of heroin.It seems that every time they sit down to eat, an ever more bizarre outside intervention takes place before they can put the food to their lips. Much later Bunuel interjects into the narrative the dreams of a young French army officer who just happens along and then the daydreams of the lead characters themselves some of which in fact overlap the dreams of the others. Some of these are eerie, while others are comical.If pushed, yes I can see the film attacking the governing elite, here shown as corrupt and without morals, but it's more the individual scenes that stay in the memory such as the shocking sequence when the local bishop, who joins the group, oddly enough as a gardener, later cold-bloodedly shoots dead an already dying man after he learns that years ago the man was the never-caught killer of his own parents or when the six are slaughtered Romanov-style by presumably Miranda freedom-fighters near the end.But I also love the comic touches like when the group discover themselves playing themselves on stage in front of a baying audience, or when an important telephone conversation is drowned out by the sound of aircraft flying overhead in an almost Woody Allen-type moment. The funniest of many in the film for me was the sight of Ray's character giving himself away to the Miranda assassins by reaching up to the table under which he is concealed for a piece of duck he's waited all movie-long to taste.Listen, don't ask me to write an essay on this film. All I know is that I found it very original, entertaining and funny in equal measure. A moveable feast in fact.",

            "content": "At age 72 when he made this film, one of his last, Luis Bu\u00f1uel showed he still had something left in the tank. The vignettes he presents here weave dreams and reality together and keep the viewer off-balance, but through it all there is a dark satire of the bourgeois. These are affluent people who aren't phased at all when a young man confesses he killed his step-father, or when a one of them finds his wife in the bedroom of another. There's a war going on nearby? No worries, let's have coffee service. Everyone around me has been gunned down, but can I just reach the food on the table to keep stuffing my face? There is no genuine human emotion here, everything is shallow, and comments are vapid. Nothing seems to phase them in their little bubble world, and that seems to be the main point, or at least, what I took away from a work that could be endlessly interpreted.I confess the frequent revelations that what we were seeing was a dream felt a little gimmicky, but it does allow a degree of fluidity in what's put up on the screen, and also allows us to peek at what's on their minds. I liked how Bu\u00f1uel's satire was usually subtle, simple non-reactions or banal behavior without hitting the viewer over the head. Hypocrisy is also exposed, e.g. A bishop being all-too-human regarding vengeance, some of the bourgeois dealing in drugs, and others going out into the bushes to ravage each other. The film held my interest but what stopped me from loving it was it sometimes seemed more interested in toying around with the viewer than developing a story line. We may be seeing the bourgeois through the eyes of a modern artist and there is something wonderful in how unconventional it is, but it wasn't the most enjoyable viewing experience, and it's not likely one I would return to.",

One of the late director's last and most effective satires was this typically mannered but nonetheless savage attack on society's ultimate villains: the church, the military and, most of all, the idle upper class, seen here frustrated while attempting to indulge in their favorite social ritual: dining out. The film is loosely organized into an elliptical series of surreal (and sometimes unrelated) episodes, in which every chance for a group of wealthy friends to share a simple meal is frustrated by, among other distractions: a funeral, a military training exercise, and finally by a band of terrorists who gun them all down in (appropriately) cold blood. Bu\u00f1uel's signature wit and dream symbolism is in ample evidence throughout, and his eye for social absurdity was rarely so critical or keen. But maybe the best joke of all in the film is that its intended targets are also the ideal audience for such highbrow humor, laughing alongside Bu\u00f1uel without even recognizing themselves as the butt of his subtle mockery.",

Second half, however, gets darker, shriller, repetitive (we really didn't need TWO soldier dreams) and distinctly less diverting until, by the end, we have come perilously close to late 60s Godard territory, what with the multiple shootings and chaos and loud left wingism.Bottom line: Even though the pilot does a less than scintillating job of landing his effervescent plane he manages to keep it afloat long after lesser satirical captains would have crashed.

It is a series of dream sequences following a group of friends - each with some form of skeleton in their closet - as they try to meet for a dinner that repeatedly gets aborted. Fernando Rey is on good form as the Ambassador from the Republic of \"Miranda\" - a man living in fear for his life from revolutionaries at home, and who is also not averse to adding a little spice to the contents of the diplomatic bag. Jean-Pierre Cassel and St\u00e9phane Audran are the \"S\u00e9n\u00e9chal\" couple - they like a bit of al fresco nookie; the \"Th\u00e9venot\" couple (Delphine Seyrig and Paul Frankeur) are ostensibly the most normal of the group, though the latter has a bit going on the side with \"Florence\" (Bulle Ogier). We are never quite sure why they are friends at all, but none of that really matters. It is the very unstructured nature of this that makes it work. Each of their dreams offers us a different - sometimes amusing, sometimes rather violent - short story as the group try to sit down to eat. Personally, I was rather fond of the gardening Bishop \"Dufour\" (Julien Bertheau) who seems to flit between his religious and gardening garb as if by magic. The dialogue isn't maybe the best, but the scenarios and a lot of imagination from director Luis Bu\u00f1uel combine to offer us something that is quirky and entertaining. It doesn't really need a cinema screening - the production and photography are fine but really this is all about some whacky characterisations that don't always make sense, but do engage.",

The running gag was a gaggle of six upper class people try endlessly to sit down for a proper meal but get interrupted by a dead body, military drills, a surreal scene of them sitting at a table when suddenly a curtain draws open and they are on a theater stage and other strange scenes like that. Later some of the six begin to have absurd dreams about their inner thoughts. So.....the film lightly mocks the upper class with some dry and unusual scenes without a plot....well then.

            "content": "Very few directors are fortunate enough to have as enlightened and supportive a producer as Serge Silberman and we owe a great debt of thanks to writer Jean-Claude Carriere for having introduced him to Luis Bunuel. This trio's first collaboration was 'Diary of a Chambermaid' and this is their third from last which is considered by many to be their chef-d'oeuvre.This film could be seen as the antithesis of Bunuel's Mexican masterpiece 'Exterminating Angel' in which a group of well-heeled guests are prevented by a mysterious force from leaving a house where they have enjoyed a sumptious repast. In this later piece, six members of the haute-bourgoisie are constantly thwarted in their desire to have a meal together by a series of bizarre interruptions and eruptions, most of which are dreamt by the protagonists. It is in fact the seamless merging of dreams and reality that makes the film so fascinating and intriguing and serves to remind us that Bunuel was strongly influenced by Freud's 'Interpretation of Dreams'.Artistic director is Pierre Guffroy, whilst Helene Plemmianikov edits and cinematography is by Edmond Richard, all three of whom were to work again with Bunuel on his last two films. Carriere's superlative script captures the hypocrisy, shallowness and utter futility of the major characters but is tempered by the fact that they are played by an appealing and impeccable cast the like of which it would be impossible to assemble now. There is little doubt that these charismatic players contribute in no small part to the film's Oscar triumph.When news of his film's Oscar nomination was announced Bunuel was asked whether he felt it had a chance of winning. He typically replied, \"Of course. I have already paid the $25,000 they wanted. Americans may have their weaknesses but they do keep their promises.\"",

However, whatever the occasion, some features, all of them very clear in the film, will prevail: hypocrisy, narcissism, selfishness, and a certain amount of stupidity.As described by the Brazilian singer Cazuza after stating that \"the bourgeoisie stinks,\" Bu\u00f1uel makes clear with his characters that the bourgeoisie wants to be rich. They are people who stand above the hungry crowd but well below the elite: advisors to politicians, bishops, colonels, diplomats. Today we would all be the ones who posted photos on Facebook showing our barbecues and a boat tour at San Antonio.At this point, the most striking feature of the film appears: although characters are ALWAYS at dinners, where the recurring subject is food itself, they can NEVER eat, either because they miss the date or because the chef is being veiled in a coffin next to the kitchen or even interrupted by military maneuvers (great!).It is as if, through cynical humor, the director condemned the bourgeoisie to never participate in the great capitalist banquet. In this context, the concept of bourgeoisie ceases to appear in political or economic significations. Here the bourgeoisie is a pure fetish, as, indeed, disseminated in social media today.Fetish is another trademark of the director. In this work, it appears in multiple tones: the couple who decide to have sex in the garden at the same time that the guests arrive for dinner, the bishop who becomes excited when dressing as a gardener (and ends up expelled from the house, until returning with his clerical dress and have his ring kissed), and in a scene worthy of Marx (the brothers), Don Rafael Acosta, ambassador of a fictitious Latin country, escapes from a firing that hits all the guests hiding under the table, but ends up betrayed when trying to get a piece of hamBourgeoisie, in 1972, were the others.

But I rarely found it more than mildly amusing.It's undeniably clever. Bunuel's dry humor sparkles, and his gentle social critique hits its marks more often than not. The penultimate shot of Fernando Rey with a slice of ham stuffed in his mouth is one of the funniest and most memorable cinematic images I've encountered in quite a while. And Delphine Seyrig breezes through her scenes with hilariously blithe detachment. But the parts don't quite add up to a greater whole.The film reaches its peak about halfway through, once a pattern has been established (dinner parties will be attended, but dining will be teasingly withheld) and the central narrative has begun to digress and fragment. As the surreal intrudes upon the quotidian, a delicious sort of suspense sets in. Pity, then, that the last forty-five minutes squander this tension, retreating to tepid farce and a rather obvious critique of upper-crust social mores.Someone on the film's board once quoted the director as saying, \"the bourgeois moral is the immoral thing for me, that which should be combated; the moral founded in our unjust social institutions as the religion, the homeland, the family, the culture, in short, the so-called pillars of the society.\" Thematically, the film consists of variations on this familiar counter-cultural conceit, and such thinking was certainly voguish in the late 60s and early 70s. It's an interesting and potentially valid argument, but I found the film's handling of the idea superficial, even clich\u00e9d.The same could be said, I suppose, of El Topo or Sweet Movie, but those films transcend glib adherence to fashionable ideologies and period style. I don't think La Charme Discret does that. Of course, it's more an urbane, low-key comedy of manners than a flaming art-bomb thrown through the window of middlebrow complacency, so perhaps the comparison is unfair. As a comedy, it is appealing, in a mild sort of way.Finally, I was disappointed by the film's look. I understand that the bland stage-set dining rooms are a device, and a successful one. But surreal detours aside, there isn't much to look at. The camera placements and movements are almost ploddingly ordinary, and while they capture the events adequately, they don't do anything interesting with them.I'm being unkind, of course, and terribly unfair. By stressing these complaints, I'm giving short shrift the wonderful performances and amusingly understated comic dialog. I'm overlooking the fabulously eerie dream sequences and Bunuel's masterful control of tone. I gave La Charme Discret a 7/10 because it IS charming, funny and somewhat intellectually intriguing. But I still came out of the experience feeling a bit let down...",

It's clever and amusing to watch at the time, but nothing about it lingers with you afterwards. There is nothing disturbing or particularly thought provoking about it. More episodic than most of his previous movies, this film could even have cross-over appeal to Monty Python fans. It features a similar stream of consciousness and playful surrealism as the best episodes of that classic Brit comedy series. Of course Cleese, Palin, Gilliam and company were no doubt already Bunuel fans to a man, so the comparison is not much of a stretch. The movie features Bunuel's usual targets - religion, middle class hypocrisy, fetishes of various kinds - but the satire isn't all that particularly biting. Even so, the movie is entertaining enough for what it is, the cast are all terrific, especially the legendary Fernando Rey, who is always a joy to watch.

A wet sock of a story gets flung around for an hour and a half, long after our brains have switched off. To be honest, this film does seem like a whale of an influence to future filmmakers. However, it is definitely not something regular film-goers can enjoy. I will say that critics, film students, and completionists will enjoy this.Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is an absurdist, surrealist film, which is almost a film school experiment. It is a series of events that befalls a group of families as they try to have dinner together. I am not kidding - they sit to have dinner and something unexpected interrupts them. There are some really bizarre incidents that happen throughout, which will leave you confounded till you realize that none of them are meant to be taken seriously. Some of the mini-stories will make a wry smile cross your face, and frankly, some of the movie is actually enjoyable. It's only that such tricks have almost no repeat value. Fool me once shame on me, fool me seven times and you are really pushing your luck, buddy! The surrealist elements of the film don't crop up till quite some time. It is not immediately apparent that many of the situations are stand-ins, either satires or surrealist fantasies. The film begins as a weak attempt at mocking the shallow lives of socialites. Their posturing, assumed statures, and adherence to arbitrary customs are easy targets that the film tries to satire. Somewhere down the line it takes a turn into the bizarre with meandering story lines, inconsequential characters, and unexpected U-turns. Some of it did bowl me over as I really didn't expect anything like it. But after a time when no pattern or method was discernible, I could do no better than appreciate the creators for their ideas without enjoying any of it.Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is a highly experimental film that needs to be applauded for its audacity, especially considering the time when it was made.

A Cafe has no tee, then they try with coffee but the Cafe does not have any coffee either. When a couple of soldiers comes to their home they polite ask them to join them.In the film the line between dreams and the absurd reality is impossible to see. The characters in the film are discreet when they are having sex and also one of the people in the film: Ray, he smuggles cocaine! A film that shows that our dreams are crazy but so is our reality to.Also the cinematography is some of the best I have seen in a long time.A highly recommended film were you(now I am saying it again=)never know what is dream and what is real.

I'd say this is the most surreal film I've seen from Bunuel and it actually took away most of the film's charm for me. I found the story itself to be quite boring and not too interesting so all the dreams and more dreams just didn't do much for me. The director's touch is wonderful throughout and he manages to get some nice laughs. The performances are also grand and the real reason to check this one out. Of the various dreams scattered throughout the film, I'd say my favorite was the one from the first segment. A good film but not in my top five from the director.",

Next up, some of the women check out a tea house which has run out of all beverages, except for water. A bishop shows up wearing gardeners clothes and is thrown out. When he returns in his vestments, they kiss his ass, revealing their hypocrisy. The good man of the cloth tells his flock that his parents were poisoned, and the murderer never caught.

Such as how the three males of the group deal in drugs or how Don Rafael(Fernando Rey), the one character poked at the most, sleeps with his pal's wife, or how the \"always-hosting\" couple escape from their window while the others await them downstairs to have a tussle in the bushes.But, Bu\u00f1uel can not resist throwing the entire narrative off course by having certain people, out of left field, enter the film telling of dreams they had such as the soldier who interrupts the ladies at a restaurant with a tale about his ghostly mother commands in poisoning the man who claims to be his father but who actually is an impostor. Another even wilder scene consists of a soldier who is asked by his fellow officers to tell a dream to the six main characters(..whose meal is yet again interrupted by Military practicing maneuvers)about meeting certain dead people he knew from the past.But, my two favorite scenes poke fun at Rafael. His country is a violent, barbaric society yet it's representative, Rafael, is in this country living a life of prestige and privilege. When confronted by the Military head regarding how uncivilized his country is, Rafael pulls a gun and shoots him! Another scene has the six finally on their way to eating a cooked lamb only to being stopped by men who break in with machine guns. Rafael hides under the table, yet gets caught when he reaches up into his plate for the sliced lamb that was to be eaten! And, the \"Bloody Sargeant\" gag is a doozy!",

And so begins the constantly frustrating quest to eat, for this group of six bourgeois friends. They are distracted and prevented by the army, the police, poor restaurants, and surreal occurrences. Like one where a red curtain unveils an audience watching them eat on a stage. The most prominent character is Raphael, played superbly by Fernando Rey. He is the ambassador of the Republic of Miranda. He is also a drug smuggler, and is stalked by a terrorist woman. There is also a priest who enters the house of one of the group, and gets the job of being their gardener. He later visits an old dying gardener to give him absolution, and it transpires the dying man requests forgiveness for killing the priest's parents. The priest tells God to forgive him, then promptly shoots him with a shotgun. The ambassador Raphael continually has his country insulted. A soldier keeps insulting Miranda, so Raphael shoots him. Just when you think the group will never get to dine, they begin and are interrupted by a gun toting group of villains. There is then a memorable shot of Raphael cowering under the table finally eating a piece of meat. But is it all a dream?

In \"The Discrete Charm of the Bourgeoisie\", the everyday becomes entangled with dream at every turn. The reality of the drug running foreign ambassador comes into direct conflict with the guerrilla forces his domestic policies engender, the gardener monseigneur of the church ends up taking confession from his parents' murderer while the culprit is on his deathbed, the cocktail party hosted by a general breaks down into a small battle in his dining room, a sexually frustrated couple are forced to elude their company and couple out in the garden, an afternoon luncheon is turned into an audit of fratricidal confession from a young army lieutenant. At every crossroads, the pretentious \"civility\" of professional society finds itself disrupted by the casual violence and mayhem that underscores their class privilege. Bunuel's use of the nightmare tells the audience what the bourgeoisie knows very well: they know what a bunch of casual gangsters they actually are, and sleep will not let them hide from themselves. And none of the charm of the bourgeoisie will be enough to break them away from their ongoing isolation from themselves and nature, expressed very cleanly by Bunuel's repeated image of the six professionals, in semi-formal dress, walking down a country road in the middle of nowhere. And it's all very funny, in an unfunny sort of way.Bunuel's masterpiece holds up well, almost forty years after its release. Here's a farce that demonstrates just how far a \"satirist\" like Sasha Baron Cohen (\"Borat\") really has to go before he has anything substantial to say with farce or film.",

            "content": "This movie forms a trilogy with the earlier \"Exterminating Angel\" and the later \"Phantom of Liberty\". They are all concerned with that stereotypically \"modern man\" termed the \"bourgeoisie\". How does Bunuel characterize this social phenomenon in this movie? Surprisingly, not as harshly as he does in the other two movies of the trilogy.The Discreet Charm does not have a prologue {as in the other two in this trilogy} but opens up with the two couples arriving in a chauffeur driven limousine. The VIP whose vehicle it is , is the ambassador for the fictional Latin American state of \"Miranda\" {in Spanish this name denotes \"admirable\" and here Bunuel's cynicism is clear}. The ambassador is corrupt, and like many Colombian diplomats of the time, was using his supposed \"diplomatic immunity\" to smuggle cocaine into France. The other two French citizens are his accomplices. They do not use the drug themselves but instead liberally dose themselves with the legally acceptable bourgeois drug \"alcohol\"In a series of humorous and teasingly droll sketches, Bunuel illustrates how these corrupt men and their colluding female partners act out their empty lives of hypocrisy and deceit.. There class snobbery is clearly demonstrated,when the Bishop dressed as a gardener is evicted from the house, but on reentering in his official clerical costume, he is immediately embraced. The bourgeois, always insecure about their own position in society, are always making presumptuous judgments about the social positions of other people, making their lack of substance obvious. Throughout the movie, the continual lack of social concern in their relationships, as emotionally connected human beings, is made clear. The metaphor of \"breaking bread together\", one of the most intimate of human experiences, is continually subverted by rampant egotism and selfish desires.The scene when Bunuel has the dining table become a stage with a prompter giving them their lines, {as in Shakespeare's As You Like It \"All the worlds a stage, and all the men and women merely players'}, is a brilliant confirmation of the emptiness of the bourgeois existence - simply stunning in its honesty {and so opposed to their inherent dishonesty}.Other facets of the devious nature, of the bourgeois personality, pursued by Bunuel in this movie, are the paranoid dream and thought constructions, used to resolve problems {a pernicious form of dishonesty} and the recurrent theme of the six bourgeois characters walking on the open road - \"The Road to Nowhere\".Bunuel devoted three whole movies to unmasking this scourge of human greed and existential poverty. The Surrealist program saw a revolution in human society as a prerequisite of a better world for all. Bunuel remained true to this creed throughout his artistic life. This movie is funny and entertaining. I can think of no greater compliment to give it.",

As with most of the work of director Luis Bu\u00f1uel it is vicious satire, but dressed up as a comedy of errors; with the characters presented more as archetypes, best viewed as caricatures consistent with the characteristics that the director believes are synonymous with those of the bourgeoisie.Throughout the film we meet a number of characters designed to convey the spirit of conformity; the seemingly polite face of the comfortable - supposedly respected - modern society. So, we have the husband, the businessman, the politician, the housewife, the working girl, the new woman, the priest and the sergeant. The way in which Bu\u00f1uel goes on to subvert these - in his mind - highly trivial characters, is to continually play with their established sensibilities in order to tease them out of their safe and secure sense of reality; to tear away the fa\u00e7ade and show the audience just how corrupt and underhanded these bourgeoisie abstractions really are, and just what lengths they are willing go to when stripped of their safe, luxurious lifestyle. Bu\u00f1uel also uses the film's intelligent and anarchic framing devise to further belittle his characters, by having the switches from day to dream - and all kinds of implied fantasies and desires - happen suddenly, and seemingly without warning. One minute we think we're viewing the film as it exists in reality, only to then find out that is some kind of drab, monstrous daydream of the terminally inane.Though perhaps a touch too dry for some sensibilities, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie has a number of amazing sequences of incredibly colourful satire and a continuing joke about narrative expectations. It is also incredibly well directed, mixing elements of high camp, soap opera melodrama and that typically European flair, all of which seem to further strengthen the director's bold, socio-political attack. For me, it's one of the great films by Bu\u00f1uel from the period in which he was creating his most interesting and accessible work.",

            "content": "Academy Award-winner The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is a largely surreal comedy film, following a few characters, including a corrupt ambassador from a fictional Latin American country, Miranda. As the title suggests, to a degree it's about uncovering the true, and not necessarily clean, life of the bourgeoisie. It has some success, and also as the title suggests, charm there. I laughed at the couple sneaking out to have sex, coming back to greet their guests with grass in their hair. Some of the characters are involved in drugs. Some resort to violence. There are other absurd things that made me laugh- the man shooting a toy is one.Some things also stood out, not necessarily for comic value. The childhood memory the lieutenant had of his mother's ghost convincing him to kill his evil guardian isn't funny, but is an interesting twist to an already-abstract film. Later, the priest finding himself having to bless the man who killed his parents is another twist, and it's interesting to see how the priest will react to the situation.That said, I found myself enjoying the first half more so than the rest of the film. As we delve deeper into the dreams within dreams, the film loses its structure, and I found myself wanting more plot. Even with the beginning, the laughs weren't coming as fast and furiously as I would have liked. Ultimately, this is a film catered to a certain taste that won't work with everybody.",

A must for any filmmaker and lover of art and culture, and a feast for any consumer. - For those who are interested: Long time ago it was worth a scandal at its US premiere at 1972 ! Surprising that the US DVD Version is still amputated for a harmless and tastefully shot scene, where the characters sit on the table, with half naked bottoms.

The conceit in Exterminating Angel is arguably more frightening, but that of Discreet Charm is, I think, more brilliant. Yes, there's something frightening about not being able to leave a table but imagine the consequences of not being able to finish a meal. Discreet Charm is also an incredibly amusing film with razor sharp satire of the upper-classes (everyone's favorite punching bags, nowadays). It's use of surrealism and dream sequences is unparalleled, I think, and probably makes the best case for surrealism's place in the cinematic arts. Bunuel was a great director and this is his greatest work (at least his greatest work that I've seen). It's intelligent, funny, and biting. It also looks terrific.",

Perhaps it's the sloppiness in the writing that doesn't sit too well with me; whenever there's a situation in search of resolving we just Fade To Black then cut to one of the principals who's dreaming it. Not too much wrong with that - if you're an amateur and this is your first movie but not when you have a track record going back forty years and change.

Very few successes. Well, in fact, let's be honest: NO successes. Social commentary and iconoclasm throughout. Think YOU can turn that into a movie? This movie is a little bit more dated-feeling in its references than The Phantom of Liberty, but the two really do share a close structural connection. Discreet Charm is slightly more \"narrative\" in the fact that the same characters keep returning, but otherwise the two movies might as well be edited together and flow into one. Apparently--and I haven't gotten around to watching it yet--Milky Way is the same. If that's the case, I'm on board.Seriously, Bunuel stands out in the world of cinema as a remarkable auteur, a serious artist with huge social engagement, and is quite admired, but there is nothing but good that can be learned from paying attention to how he uses his camera to direct your eye and how he blocks scenes. The guy has consummate control of space that usually only Hitchcock gets praise for. Few filmmakers really achieve this level of direct eye--Antonioni and Tarkovsky could be included in this list. Kim Ki Duk is aiming to get there. But in his 70s French cinema, Bunuel is the bullseye.--PolarisDiB",

At this point Ithought that his whole point in wanting to take over the gardeningwas to poison the herbs.  This may sound a little silly now, but thisis exactly what this movie does, it makes all possibilities plausibleand acceptable.  Despite the fact that this was made over 30 years ago, I think itretains all its charm is a wonderful (and sympathetic) satire of theFrench bourgeoisie, who is obsessed with eating caviar but endsup eating an omelet with ham.

The film thereby is a brilliant antithesis to \"The exterminating angel\", that Bunuel made 10 years earlier in 1962. In this film the characters are unable to finish a dinner party.Each interruption of the dinner party is a seperate episode and there is no logic or plot line combining the different episodes. Without any doubt Bunuel tries to prove that \"le charme discret\" is nothing else than hypocrisy, but in my opinion \"Belle de jour\" (1967, Luis Bunuel) was more convincing in this respect.All in all \"Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie\" looks (too) much as a Monty Phyton production.",

I think all of those in the case from Fernando Rey as Rafael Acosta to Robert Le Beal as the tailor, did a great job, making the film a bit more compelling. This film, which is like a set of vignettes strung together reminds me a bit of The Meaning of Life (1983) but only in that it also is a set of vignettes that are strung together, not that both films are similar in some way, but are actually very different. I don't really have much else to say about this film other than its weird nature and the fact that it is almost like a set of hallucinations on top of other hallucinations, making you question what is real and what is not.In the end, this film perhaps has its positives but it is still not my favorite film by far, as other films which are also absurd, are much better, like Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (2003) to give one example.

Among his most famous films are \"Un chien andalou\", \"The Exterminating Angel\", \"Belle de Jour\", and \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\", his only Oscar winning effort. The film is made up of a multitude of comical scenes and sketches that follows almost no story arc whatsoever. Whatever plot can be pieced together through hilarious scene after scene is very slim and minor. The film focuses on a group of upper class bourgeois friends whose lives seem to be falling apart in a rather surrealist fashion, particularly whenever they attempt to eat dinner together. This premise works as the set up for various gags and satirical jabs that are bizarre but smart. Bunuel was a genius in terms of both humor and the cinematic art form, and this film was perhaps created at the height of his powers when any possible limits were automatically eliminated within the first few minutes of a Bunuel film. His gift for sharp social satire never ceased to be no matter what age he became, and this film may be the most notable example of such a statement. It is a praised and downright beloved film despite its lack of plot and heavy doses of often experimental surrealism. This is a film that has been wildly acclaimed for one ruling reason; yes, it may be a sharp social critique and a brilliant art-house classic and an essential surrealist work, but it is most importantly genuinely hilarious. This is a COMEDY of the highest (and flat out funniest) degree, despite there being a few tragic and legitimately emotional sequences. Once you have witnessed this comic gem of a film, you may very well have reached the peak of world cinema.

            "content": "\"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" is a satire of the aristocratic (or bourgeoisie) class told in a series of (occasionally) surreal vignettes. The main takeaway of this film is that, despite the luxurious surface and their obsession with the proper etiquette, the members of the bourgeoisie class are just as bad as the people they chastise.The characters in this film think of people in terms of rich and poor, and, in their eyes, the poor are thieves and the rich are noble. For instance in the introduction of the priest character, he comes to the characters mansion to apply for a gardening job, and he just goes right out to the gardening she'd and gets in gardening clothes, so when he comes back and they see him, they immediately kick him out because he seems like a poor man. But when he walks back in soon after wearing his priest robes, they start kissing his hands.The characters themselves in the film are drug dealers, yet when it is brought up that some of the soldiers smoke marijuana, they begin to talk about how much they hate drug addicts. One of the characters is the ambassador of Miranda and in one scene murders an army general for accusing Miranda of having many murders. Later he also sympathizes with a Nazi simply because he was from Miranda and the ambassador had met him. The film is filled with moments like these, for instance: A woman complains about a meal not being expensive enough; the priest goes against all his values of forgiveness and kills a man, practically for no reason considering he was dieing anyway; a man tries to have sex with a woman who tried to kill him, and then arranges her kidnapping because she doesn't, proving himself just as bad, if not worse, than her, etc...But perhaps the most genius example of this (and the most well known) is the moment where the group of rich characters finds themselves on a stale in front of an audience. There is a man feeding them lines. One character almost gets out one line, and then nervously walks backstage, and the rest of the characters follow. Well, all but one, who starts sweating and says \"I forgot my lines...\". Then he wakes up. This scene exposes them for what they are. The big house, the fancy furniture, and the etiquette are all just for show. They are just an act, a disguise, to hide the kind of people that they really are.",

A group of middle-class people trying to have dinner keep getting interrupted in bizarre ways. There isn't much of a plot here and it often makes little sense. Essentially, it's just a collection of symbols and metaphors, but done in the best possible way with humour, brilliant style and enormous intelligence. It's an insane, wildly entertaining and endlessly smart oddball of a movie, with a fine script and Luis Bunuel's superb direction allowing the film to get better and better as it goes from one beautifully bizarre scene to another. It's a film which you'd never see now, and as an expression of art and innovation, it's a true delight to watch. This is enormously recommended for fans of Alejandro Jodorowsky and David Lynch as well as fans of the avant-garde in general. It's a really fascinating film and critiques of society don't get much cooler than this. Highly recommended and well-worth seeing. Just don't expect a plot, a hint of logic or sense or a single dull moment. 9/10",

Luis Bunuel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is a scathing indictment of France's rich and powerful, a surreal satire that is unmistakably the work of Bunuel, the master of surrealism.  Cleverly written and constructed, it is as good as anything Bunuel ever directed.

The pacing was near perfect, with much of the plot action creating the impetus for the very next scene, allowing a natural flow to some of the most bewilderingly unnatural circumstances.

            "content": "I think this is quite an interesting look at French 'society' - which they call the Bourgeois - which apparently has quite a lot less class than English 'society'. In England we call them boiled onions and it is fit only as a stock for making soup, in France they call it French Onion soup (although they probably just call it onion soup over there) and serve it as a meal, or worse they take quite disgusting food like frogs and snails and call it fine cuisine. It is this kind of attitude which makes everyone hate the French, Bourgeois or otherwise. France makes artists and England makes gentlemen (traditionally), not the other way around it would appear.\n\nThe characters are not really individuated and representative only of themselves but where they are symbolic of something else - archetypes. Here showing the various kind of people the writers presumably believe the Bourgeois to consist of - be it the half hedonists that just want to fuck, eat great food and live in a beautiful place, or the distinguished ambassador who believes himself to be a kindly socialist but actually is lecherous towards young ladies who want to kill him and murders people at dinner parties,  the rather unimportant man who has nothing whatsoever to offer except advice on how to make dry martinis and his drunken wife who is even less of a contributor. Although this is obviously all an incredibly sardonic slash at Bourgeois society for me personally there is nothing here that would distinguish the class as any worse than any other. No doubt the writers would have us believe that the working classes who, if we are to portray them in the same vein, f*ck mindlessly like animals, get blind drunk on trash to fight and swear at each other, stab each other to death in the gutters down some quiet street and see art and culture as a worse enemy than fascism as somehow more real and admirable. The problem here is not with one class and not another - it is with all classes. In fact eating good food with \"herbs from the garden\", knowing how to make a nice dry martini and enjoying a good f*ck is not something I would single out as an object of criticism.\n\nI long ago realised politics causes many problems, will solve none and yet is still necessary. Therefore where before I had strong political leanings I now think about it no more than is necessary. But we are in the role of film critics, not political commentators and so should be looking at the Charm as a film. It did have some interesting bits. I like the 'play' dream, largely as I could understand it - showing how their dinner parties are all a show and nothing is really authentic and also the bishop becoming the gardener showing how even the church works for the rich. Some bits were a little more out of place like the lieutenant in the cafe, or the army showing up and the sergeant recounting his dream, it seemed strange but added interest and we could maybe drag some meaning out of it if we really worked to. The overall message of their dreams, I guess, was that the rich have all this paranoia, dissatisfaction and suffering  but that is not really something that is bespoke to the upper classes and quite honestly the lower classes need to change their ways just as much. This film had a complete lack of poor people - except where they invited in the chauffeur to drink as if to watch a monkey in a zoo.\n\nI wonder if the arrests at the end hark back to the French revolution?\n\nSo although from a straightforward point of view the characters are paper thin and the plot lacks depth completely, this is another one of those films that is not art for art's sake but the director has some other message he wants to get across - here it is largely political and mostly about class distinction. And that message is also paper thin and full of holes from a philosophical point of view but we must allow people to express themselves in a way they see fit though we do not have to buy into their message, no matter how convincing and sardonic it is at first look. As a message or critique of life life it would be getting a very low score from me and some of those characters I would not even criticise too much, certainly not based on class or somehow worse than some of the working class archetypes, if one wants to f*ck and eat good food from the garden and make good cocktails so be it there are worse pastimes. The left wing message borne from hate for society people is tiresome. However, as a film it had some interest 6/10.",

Regardless, it's still a funny film, a socially-focused surrealist comedy that revolves around the premise that, regardless of the bizarre circumstance and jagged, incomprehensible story, it is of paramount importance that these people not be able to eat a meal together. Before ZAZ would commercialize the format with mile-a-minute jokes in the ensuing decade, Bu\u00f1uel used the distinctive style of humor to create a piece of social criticism that is all the funnier due to its bizarre structure.

Jesus, all those dream sequences during the last 30 minutes of the movie were a complete mind fuck. \n\nNot really my kind of movie with the whole surrealist part of it all, but it was quite interesting to watch. I guess the rich and powerful never really get to eat, is Bunuel's message here. Bunuel, being someone who was against the rich and powerful, found a way to almost mock and ridicule the bourgeoisie to the point of satire. I can say without a doubt that there has never been a film made like this one. All the interruptions during the main story line and the ridiculous occurrences that happen throughout the movie would make anyone nowadays turn off the movie immediately. One must have patience and not question anything at all when watching this movie. You must remember that Bunuel is the master of Surrealism and his way of making movies is unlike anyone else. \n\nNevertheless, this was an interesting movie with some even more interesting side stories from people who weren't part of the six main bourgeoisie.",

            "content": "Challenging Movie experience...\nWinner of Oscar Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Luis Bu\u00f1uel's \"Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie \" (The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie). \nLook at that title , Even that name flows off the tongue .Right?\nNeedless to say,It's tough to review a movie like this because no review could really do this film justice.And as in any Bu\u00f1uel film, there's much much in the film than the plot.But let's give it a try.Well, I can introduce this movie as a Bunuel's sly, satirical and surrealistic reprimand on the capricious nature of humanity. \n\nWhat you are going to see is a group of people, all representing the upper middle class, spend their time attempting to have a decent meal. Also Bunuel interrupts the main story again and again with several secondary storylines. That's the simplest way to describe the film and this movie, which contains a simple plot as you are envisaging now , assuring you of one thing, that you will be dragged through a 'seriously what was it all about' situation at the end of the movie. And that's where the simplicity of the story is gonna deride you. In those secondary clips, *Spoiler* \\ Several times throughout the movie the six main characters would be shown just walking along a paved road in the middle of nowhere. Here is my interpretation about that, because those clips should be understood since they hold a significant connotation, I suppose. Those scenes illustrate how weak and worthless they are without the lower class people surrounding them , they feel lost, they are not even able to interact with each other. Or Clips are used to make the transitions between other scenes or could be a dream. Who knows? /\n\nNo one is going to make a statement proving that only his interpretation is valid other than his name is Luis Bu\u00f1uel. There might be many interesting and valid interpretations given by different viewers. Because Luis Bu\u00f1uel is one of the world's most significant Surrealists in filmmaking and he also believed in leaving the viewers to their own individual interpretations. Surrealism is probably the best answer when an entire movie is based on interpretations like this ..\n\nOnce again, Hello ARTHOUSE + SURREALISM movie fans , Download or get your hands on a copy somehow!",

Luckily it had three of my favourite French actors from the period, in Bulle Ogier (just check out 'Maitresse' if you don't understand why), Delphine Seyrig and Fernando Rey (for the two 'French Connection' films alone)--even though for a director of Bunuel's strength, any actors could have sufficed.

Yes, they talk about Bunuel the director, or (from David Thomson) Bunuel the photographer, but people never realize his two nominations for the Calanda, Spain-native were never for director, but for writing (with another nod for his swan song, 'The Obscure Object of Desire').",

Then he did this, which was a savage return to the surrealism of Un Chien Andalou (1927). The film has no plot so to speak of, but it's connected by a series of dreams, all revolving around a group of people Monsieur Th\u00e9venot (Paul Frankeur) and his wife Simone (Delphine Seyrig) and her sister Florence (Bulle Ogier). There's also Henri S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (Jean-Pierre Cassel) and his wife Alice (St\u00e9phane Audran), and they're joined by foreign ambassador Rafael Acosta (Fernando Rey). It follows their attempts to have several dinner parties together and outside forces preventing them from doing so, like a nearby army base firing at the house, and everyone getting arrested for no reason. It's very surreal, and you don't get films that leave everything unexplained like this anymore.

Alfred Hitchcock considered him the best director of all times, which is why he fits nicely in my study of Hitchcock films.How can a film be both absurdist and overtly realistic? A combination of zany wit and a teaspoon of class struggle make this movie one of my all time favorites. It really rips off of the screen, and makes sure to leave a lasting impression in the mind. The only downfall is that the English subtitled version does a shoddy job of translating the numerous bon mots in the script.

            "content": "9.1/10\r\n\r\n            There's something that's always bothered me about Hollywood movies, yet it's something that I never knew bothered me until now. The thing that irritates, troubles, and challenges me is the fact that almost all Hollywood films - good or bad - must have a point; they must make sense. They have a narrative that's genuinely easy to follow, they usually tend to have characters that we like and can relate to. I don't mind this, but then again, it's like I said; it bothers me the slightest bit, and that's good enough for me.\r\n\r\n I bring this up at this moment because Luis Bu\u00f1uel's \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" does not make sense; and it almost doesn't have much of a point beyond existence. It's a peculiar film that is meant to confuse; but through trickery, not through muddled screen-writing. The filmmaker must enjoy seeing us scratch our heads with puzzled faces; and he must like it every time we do it. Bu\u00f1uel is known for repeating himself in some of his movies, but only because people like this quality about the man.\r\n\r\n         Now, \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" is about a group of bourgeois acquaintances who make several attempts to sit down and enjoy a nice dinner. The first attempt fails because they arrive at a time when the meal had not been planned or prepared. The second attempt is also not a success because the manager of the building which they would eat in had just passed away, that very moment.\r\n\r\n Man, I could go on-and-on about how many times this grand dinner fails to ensue, but I won't spoil too much. \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" is a dish best served cold. You shouldn't know too much or too little about it. Hell, the only thing I personally believe you need to know about it when going in is that it's about people who sit down, multiple times, to eat, but never actually get down to it. \r\n\r\n  Throughout the film, there are some fascinating talks and depictions of dreams. Within these dreams are ghosts and voices that taunt, but cannot be heard. I loved the scene in which a speaking solider tells the dinner guests of his dream, in which he walks a lonely city road, but cannot find anyone who he had wanted to see. There are many complications with these characters throughout the movie, although few of them are actually characterized as many would hope they would be.\r\n\r\n But this is not your average movie. In fact, no surrealist film should be. Bu\u00f1uel is a master when it comes to recycling ideas and even premises, or styles, and making us interested all over again. His fans will love this film, and maybe, just maybe, so will newcomers. It's fascinating, and it's often times funny; and sometimes even startling. You know you're watching a one-of-a-kind film when the dinner guests find out they're on a stage, acting in front of an audience full of people, although the sequence later proves to be nothing more than a dream. \r\n\r\n   Look. There's not much else I can say for this movie. It is what it is; well-written, well-directed trickery. The surrealism works, although it's not as extreme as I expected it to be. The visuals are not what matters here; what matters here, is ultimately, what the film wants to do and how much of that it accomplishes. Some may argue that it's not perfect, but I have a good counter-attack for that one: how is it not? The film is interesting, perhaps even intellectual. It is confusing, but decidedly so. It could not have been made any other way, and I openly love it as it is. This is a perfect movie; one of director Bu\u00f1uel's best. See it because it exists, and because it's as good as it is, and there's really no other reasons beyond those.",

This is the first full-length film I've seen from the legendary surrealist/satirist Luis Bunuel (having seen only his notorious short Un Chien Andalou), and it does make me want to see his other work. I guess the quickest way to describe this movie is that it feels like what would happen if David Lynch's movies became a lot more watchable and funny.\n\nThere is and isn't a plot to speak of. The movie focuses on six characters, a bunch of French upper-class nitwits (well, one of them is an ambassador), who keep trying to sit down to dinner together, but keep getting interrupted by increasingly bizarre circumstances. Some of these interruptions are really funny. There are also random interludes where some supporting character who has not been seen before and will not be seen again tells everyone about his creepy dream/memory. The movie is also continually playing with us in terms of its levels of reality - at one point, I think, we are seeing what the movie tells us is a dream, within what surprisingly turns out to be a dream, which itself turns out to be in another dream, which itself turns out to be in another (I think). It's like Inception, but without any logic or rules. You could subject the movie to intense analysis to try to sort all that out, but I think to do so would be to miss the point, as the movie is probably honestly just messing around.\n\nThe cast is excellent. The one actor I recognized was Fernando Rey, who had played the French drug dealer in The French Connection the year before this movie. He was really insufferable in a villainous way in The French Connection, and really insufferable in a hilarious way in this movie. The rest of the cast is extremely good at playing annoying, petty-bourgeois types. \n\nThis movie won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar for its year, and was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay, an impressive achievement for a film that a) is foreign and b) has no true plot. It did deserve those, though, I think. The movie just has this unique feel to it; I'm willing to bet there's nothing else like this except for other Bunuel films. You never find a movie that can at once be funny, creepy, satirical, and boldly in defiance of normal narrative structure all at once. While it's not funny in a laugh-out-loud sense for the most part, it is very funny in a bemused, wry-grin sort of way. I definitely have to explore more Bunuel movies now.",

People that belong to the  Bourgeois society, when portrayed in a darker light, can be the most irritating of film characters, but when took on stage to forcibly look at their own shortcomings that they hide with their material excesses, can be one of film lovers' secret pleasures to watch on celluloid: Let the self-obsessed hypocrites be deconstructed by some unknown force. But Bunuel, although making the film to be a major attack on the particular social class, did not finish the film laughing along with the audience; But more of like postponing the punchline of an insult joke. As shown in the film, when it's a dream, \"kill them all!\" and \"humiliate the bastards!\" can be some of the most recurring of proletariat battlecries, when fantasy fades and reality sets back, \"absolve them of their sins\" more like. Maybe having them miss some of their lavish lamb chops and caviars is enough. Surrealist film at its top form.",

I think my favorite scene was most likely when everyone gets shot, and one is hiding under the table, then he reaches up to get a piece of lamb even though he will be discovered as well.  This just spoke about the movie the most for me.  The bourgeoisie are people who see themselves better than everyone else, but still have needs and when they do the needs must be filled.  They are selfish.  One of the girls seems like she might be down to earth, but there is a scene where one of the men invites their driver in to have a martini.  The driver takes a quick chug, and when he leaves they talk behind his back about how he drank it incorrectly.  The girl fights back for him, but only says that he is uneducated.  These people believe that you must live in society's standards and not your own way.  The more acceptable you seem in society then the more successful you are.  However, even these people have dreams where they try to actually sit down and have a dinner, but they can't even do it here.  And there are scenes where they are walking straight down a road, with apparently no where to go.  Bunuel used his writing as something fun.  He would do anything he wanted to drive his points home.  In this way he reminds me of Gilliam and Lynch.",

            "content": "Luis Bunuel's \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" hardly resembles what you'd call a typical movie. It's structure is anecdotal, and it therefore comes off as a series of surrealist short films. These sequences could stand on their own - they're simple stories involving the obscure lusts and temptations lingering underneath the facade of manners. To Bunuel, the idea of a bourgeoisie lifestyle is contradictory to our animal instincts, and he has no problem making fun of some of the absurdities we carry out in an effort to remain \"civilized\". \n\nThe plot is quite simple: six bourgeois friends are trying to sit down and have a meal together. Each time, however, their efforts are thwarted. The wide array of obstacles include arriving to the host's house on the wrong day, finding out that a restaurant owner is being mourned in an adjacent room, and, eventually, finding out that their stale roast chicken is actually a stage prop. Things seem to get stranger as they progress, with some of the scenes in the last half hour being dreams within dreams. For instance, we hear of the horror story of a prison guard who comes back to kill. Then, of course see him: ethereal, bloody, and blue. And, at another point, a soldier recalls his childhood, which also involves the supernatural.\n\nI've only seen a few of Bunuel's films, but what i've found striking is how they're able to be critical without being angry or vengeful. The films i've seen all point fingers at the same social class of people, but each time Bunuel seems to identify with them rather than hate them. He realizes the absurdities, the inconsistencies, the hypocrisy, and the illusions, and he, in a way, embraces them. When, for instance, a group of soldiers fire on the dinner guests in a dream sequence, one of them takes refuge under a table. He then foolishly gives away his position by trying to sneak some food off of his plate - he can't help himself. While his ideas can be cynical, he's presenting them in such a manner that it's amusing and far from hateful. The films, no matter how dark, are comic and completely charming.\n\nLike \"Belle de Jour\" and \"Diary of a Chambermaid\", the film deals with sexual desires and fantasies hidden behind the illusion of grounded stability. There is a bishop who acts out his fantasies of working as a gardener for the wealthy, and we also see two hosts head outside to make love while they're expecting guests. When they arrive back in the house, dirty and picking leaves off of each other, it's the perfect contrast between \"civilized\" humans and ones driven by animalistic instinct.\n\n\"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" is certainly an odd film that, at times, will leave you scratching your head. But it's such a welcome departure from more conventional films that strictly follow their structure. It's loose and playful, and thus it establishes a memorable dreamlike quality. I can't say I made sense of it all, but I don't know if that's the point. What matters most, however, is how humorous, charming, and inventive it is.",

If you are still reading and do not fit into either category, the rest of this review is for you since both previously mentioned parties will have made up their minds.  A group of six aristocratic snobs cannot eat dinner.  That's it.  One time they sit down at the table and a passing army barges in.  Another time at a restaurant, they discover a funeral is taking place for the manager of the establishment.  Later on at another meal, they are all arrested.  Oh, and tales of a boy's mother's ghost telling him to poison his supposed father, piano torture (it makes sense if you see it), theatre performances and more round out the flick.  And none of it quite gels as female terrorists, dream sequences without warning and a gardening priest make their presences felt.  In anyone else's hands, this would have been disastrous but Bunuel shines as he mocks upper society, religion, the army and other ripe targets.  No one is safe, including the audience who is never fully aware of what is going on, and the result is an experience you will either love or try to immediately forget about (probably over dinner).",

They arrive on the wrong night, or are dismayed to find the dead body of the restaurant owner in the next room, or are bothered by military maneuvers. Dinner is the cardinal civil convention of the middle classes, a means of showing affluence and social grace. It also affords the aid of something to do and something to chat about, and that is a blessed comfort, not only because so many of the bourgeoisie have nothing much to talk about, and there is a vast lot of things they wish will not be brought up.\n\nMost movies make believe their plots are de facto and that we need to buy into them unequivocally. Comedies are sanctioned to be remiss in this case. Most of the films of Luis Bunuel, who made nearly 40, are comedies somehow, but he doesn't go for shticks and wisecracks, although it seems that way from a distance. His ironic sense of humor is more like a jeer, witty and caustic.\n\nThe humor in this absurdist film is in the way Bunuel barges in on the meals with the back-door goings-on that skulk below the facade of his deteriorating European nobility: irrationality, extramarital affairs, drug dealing, swindling, military coups, debauchery and the inertia of apathy. His main characters are politicians, the military and the wealthy, but in a giving state of mind he lays on a supporting character to ridicule the church, a bishop whose fetish is to disguise as a gardener and work as a servant in the gardens of the rich. This Oscar-winning head trip was Bunuel's most successful film. It was released in a year when civil anxiety was at its apex, the Vietnam War was in imbued blossom, and the upper middle class was a stylish aim of contempt. How contrastive to see it in 2009, when wealth is by and large longed for and coveted. The essential crowd for the film in 1972 viewed it as holding others up to censure; the essential crowd today will, if it is \"discreet,\" view it as holding itself up to censure.\n\nFrom the start, we are conscious of the way the characters behave themselves. They emanate their prestige, certain of who they are, and exhibit their class in society like a uniform. Seemingly austere Fernando Rey's tiny grandstander of an ambassador, suave and rather penetrating Stephane Audran's affluent lady of the house, Bulle Ogier's disinterested and alcoholic sister, all behave like they're performing a play. And highlight the bishop, played with an oddly passionate superficiality by Julien Bertheau, who shows up at the door in gardener's clothes and is disdainfully kicked out, just to return in his holy attire to \"explain himself,\" and be welcomed.\n\nThe misanthropic daydream is fractured into independent scenes, showing the dull face of the fashionable privileged and the appetites that crouch underneath it. A couple awaits guests for dinner. In the bedroom, they are bowled over by horniness. The guests show up. Now they cannot have sex in the bedroom because the wife \"makes too much noise,\" the husband carps, so they sneak out a window and vigorously screw in the woods. Then they creep back into the house, leaves and grass in their hair. Bourgeoisie civilities, Bunuel quaintly suggests, are the meagerest disguise for our primal capacities. Another instance: After soldiers blitz the dinner guests, a man evades doom by hiding under a table, yet gives himself away by gluttonously reaching up for the uneaten meat on his plate.\n\nThe film's story progression is blithely ruptured by Bunuel's methods. As women have drinks in a garden caf\u00c3\u00a9, a lieutenant walks over and begins a distressing account of his childhood. We see his autobiography in flashback. He wishes them good day and leaves. A dinner party progresses abnormally when the roast chickens are dropped by the servant and emerge as stage props, and then the curtain goes up and the guests discover themselves on stage facing an audience. Dreams entwine inside dreams, not due to the characters being baffled, but because Bunuel is entertaining himself by using such barefaced gimmicks.\n\nThis sardonic musing, co-written with Jean-Claude Carriere with quick wit and intellectual enthusiasm, is not grim or agitated, but mocking and amazed. Financed by the French producer Serge Silberman, Bunuel was finally at deserved liberty to satiate his far-ranging imagination, and the movie is free of any commercial or coherent conditions. Bunuel was contemptuous, though not disheartened. We say one thing and do another, yes, but that doesn't make us immoral, just human and, from his outlook, hilarious. He has been dubbed a depraved filmmaker, but the more I discover his films the more insight and affirmation I see, as well as a strong social awareness.",
