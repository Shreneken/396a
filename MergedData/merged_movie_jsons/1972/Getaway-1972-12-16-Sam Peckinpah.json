            "content": "Steve McQueen and Sam Peckinpah teamed to do two straight films, probably some of the best work in both of their careers. But the difference in a nice character study like Junior Bonner and a tough crime drama like The Getaway shows the versatility of both these remarkable men. The Getaway seems to take its inspiration from John Huston's classic, The Asphalt Jungle.McQueen is a career criminal whose parole has once again been denied in the ten year stretch he's doing. Wife Ali McGraw submits to parole board chief Ben Johnson's sexual advances to spring McQueen. But the corrupt Johnson isn't just about sexual harassment. He wants McQueen to rob a bank that his brother is a director, to cover a nice case of embezzlement. He even recruits another pair of criminals, Bo Hopkins and Al Lettieri as part of the gang. Of course the plan goes wrong as a bank guard is killed and then Hopkins is killed in a double-cross by Lettieri who then fails to do the same to McQueen and McGraw. After that it's a three way race to the border between Johnson's men, Lettieri, and McQueen. Al Lettieri is a talent that was lost to us way too soon. He played some of the best villains in the early seventies and this one is one of them. He kidnaps veterinarian Jack Dodson and his slut of a wife Sally Struthers. Soon she's more than willing to go and be his girl. Struthers has a great part, so far from being Gloria Bunker Stivic on All in the Family.My favorite Sam Peckinpah moment in all of his films is that climax at Dub Taylor's flea bag hotel where all the forces meet and shoot up the place. It's Peckinpah's best violence ballet in all of his films, I never tire of seeing it.The whole film was shot in Texas and I'm not sure how residents of Texas might like this picture of their state. It seems to be one very violent place and a very corrupt one as well.But I like The Getaway very much, it's my favorite Sam Peckinpah film next to Ride the High Country.",

            "content": "King of cool Steve McQueen teams with \"Bloody Sam\" Peckinpah for this thoroughly engaging story of a couple on the lam following a botched robbery.Walter Hill adapts the novel by Jim Thompson in this story of Carter \"Doc\" McCoy (McQueen), a criminal currently doing time. His wife Carol (Ali MacGraw) manages to secure his release by playing up to crooked parole board chief Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson); Doc and Carol are then made to participate in a bank robbery which goes as wrong as movie lovers everywhere could expect it to. Doc and Carol have to make their way across Texas to Mexico and safety while being trailed by Rudy Butler (Al Lettieri), a vengeance minded member of the gang.The cast simply couldn't be better in this sexy, slick, violent production; even MacGraw isn't bad as the wife with a loyalty to her man through thick and thin. McQueen once again has an undeniable presence on screen and the viewer can believe that he's going to keep going despite the odds. Johnson is enjoyably slimy, Lettieri scores as a truly rotten creep, and Richard Bright, Jack Dodson, Dub Taylor, Bo Hopkins, and Roy Jenson all do well in assorted memorable bits. The ever affable Slim Pickens doesn't appear until near the end of the picture, but he helps to close it on a very ingratiating final note.Peckinpah is in very fine form here, creating a milieu where moral considerations often go out the window. Doc isn't necessarily a \"good guy\", yet we still can't help but root for him, especially when characters like Beynon and Butler are even worse. Just to give people an idea of how sleazy Butler is, he thinks nothing of dallying with vapid, sexpot blonde Fran (Sally Struthers) in front of her weakling husband Harold (Dodson). The many vignettes along the way keep you eagerly watching - Doc is forced to pursue another thief (Bright) to get his own ill gotten money back, for one - but the highlight is undeniably the incredibly tense sequence aboard the garbage truck. Peckinpah once again demonstrates a real flair for the kind of stylized violence he perfected in \"The Wild Bunch\", with blood spurting and many squibs exploding.People can hardly fail to notice that again the director is not about to go the politically correct route, as a resentful Doc, still not happy about what Carol did with Beynon, slaps her around. Yet, when Doc punches Frans' lights out later, it actually provokes a reaction of relief from the audience because it puts an end to her shrill whining.Overall the film makes for fine entertainment. Even at two hours and three minutes, it's remarkably well paced and tension filled, and it never falters, kicking into gear for a rousing final act. Highly recommended.10 out of 10.",

            "review_title": "This movie is a true masterpiece",
            "content": "I consider \"The getaway\" a true masterpiece, on the same level of Sam Peckinpah's major achievements (save \"The wild bunch\", of course). I learn from IMDb comments that the final cut of the movie was made by other people (McQueen ?!) than the director. Moreover the plot is much unfaithful to the original novel... Well... anyway the result is excellent.Doc (Steve McQueen) is a tough, laconic guy, Carol (Ali McGraw) a tough, laconic woman. In some sense, they mostly speak just for technical reasons: \"Take the money-bag\", \"Don't scratch your wound\"... If they've nothing to say, they keep quiet. They seem shy to express their reciprocal feelings, even unable to say \"I love you\". Doc cannot accept what Carol has done, although just to help him out of jail. They both silently suffer for this, with some explosions of violence by Doc, and a ready gritty reply by Carol. But the audience well understand from their body-language how much they love each other.   I think that McQueen and McGraw made a superb job in their difficult roles. Strangely enough, their performances, as well as their lines, received much criticism. I fear that people didn't like their job since they are too used to the current way of acting: hysterical, screaming, awfully clown-like. With lines that are just floods of stupid, pointless, annoying chats. A not welcome legacy of the style created by Tarantino, Oliver Stone and imitators. Nothing could be more far-away from Peckinpah's artistic taste.\nThe story of the movie is linear, but not trivial. The cinematography and montage are outstanding. The pace is somewhat slow, partially due to the great care paid to details. But when it's the time of action, nobody can compete with Peckinpah's grand style.In every movie of his, Peckinpah shows his genius with some astonishing, stark new cinematic ideas. In \"The getaway\" we find the paramount representation of the \"power of the shot-gun\". Doc's shot-gun bullets destroy police-cars, devastate a whole hotel, demolish an elevator, knock down a door slaughtering the thug hidden behind... the recoil of the weapon lifts Doc's shoulder... Who remembers that this stuff, nowadays almost a cliche in action-movies, was introduced in \"The getaway\"? It's worth noting that an early imitator of Peckinpah's \"shot-gun scenes\" was Steven Spielberg in \"Sugarland express\".Some words on the sub-plot concerned with the hateful Rudy (Al Lettieri) and the cretinous Fran (Sally Struthers). This part of the film is deliberately disagreeable, up to an almost unbearable point. As usual, Peckinpah doesn't miss his chance to be hated by the feminists, with his design of Fran. A damned idiot, nymphomaniac just for stupidity. At the end, when Doc hits her (a punch straight on her prating, whimpering mouth!) the director nearly provokes a standing ovation by the audience (men and women, as well). If that's not cinematic genius, what else is it? And, speaking of imitators, how much Tarantino's characters owe to Rudy and Fran?Perhaps \"The getaway\" could have been even better without extraneous interference. Nonetheless, it is a fantastic film, a must-see.",

            "content": "Sick and tired of new releases I couldn't get through 45 minutes of, I went back to a classic: Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway. What a breath of fresh air this 1972 heist/chase movie turned out to be. In addition to hyper realistic characterizations of the McCoys (played by Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw), everything else about this movie rings true. 35 years later, Peckinpah's signature slo-motion shoot outs stand up against anything in the theaters today. There's little to dislike about this movie and I can't help but wonder why movies aren't made like this anymore: no special FX, no over-the-top stunt sequences, no melodramatic dialogue, not fat, no filler. This is a movie made by real people, for real people. Plain and simple.Technically, the stand-out aspect within The Getaway is the editing. Influenced by the French New Wave, Peckinpah defies convention by playing with time and space as he uses disjointed cuts to jump ahead in time before allowing the events within the movie to catch up to the present. The most interesting example of this occurs when Doc and Carol are at a busy park alongside a river. Doc has just been released from prison and he's soaking in the sights and sounds of freedom. Peckinpah cuts to a shot of Doc jumping into the river with his clothes on, followed by Carol. At first this feels like a fantasy in Doc's head since we abruptly cut back to the present where Doc is still standing and looking at the river. But soon he actually does run to and jump into the river. From there we cut directly to Carol's apartment where the two enter soaking wet and smiling. It is atypical and unexpected to see unconventional editing like this in mainstream American movies, but when it's done (and done right) there' something incredibly rewarding about having your brain (and expectations) teased in such a randomly disjointed (yet fluid) way. Another example of unconventional yet incredibly effective montage happens in the opening thirty minutes. In this sequence Doc McCoy (McQueen) is locked up in prison and slowly losing his wits. Peckinpah portrays Doc's inner head space through a dizzying montage of shots of Doc in and around the prison, where synced sound cuts smash into one another in a relentlessly pounding and oppressive manner. You get the sense something has to break and before long you realize it's Doc's resolve.Peckinpah proves with The Getaway that you don't need astounding source material to make a great movie. On the written page I'm sure this film seemed like a very standard heist/chase film. But by allowing the actors to bring realistic, idiosyncratic performances to the table and by utilizing unorthodox techniques, such as French New Wave inspired editing, Peckinpah elevates pulp into high art. I know I'm sounding like a broken record by saying this but: where are the artists in Hollywood today?http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",

            "review_title": "One of Sam Peckinpah's Best Films",
            "content": "Director Sam Peckinpah struck pay dirt with this adaptation of author Jim Thompson's novel about an inside bank job in contemporary Texas. Not only did \"The Getaway\" prove to be a hit for Peckinpah but it also bolstered Steve McQueen's career. Previously, Peckinpah and McQueen had collaborated on \"Junior Bonner,\" but \"Bonner\" did nothing for them at the box office. The film is an amazingly mellow movie for a Peckinpah film and is comparable to \"The Ballad of Cable Hogue.\" Conversely, \"The Getaway\" contained virtually everything that a Peckinpah movie needed, primarily action, intrigue, and violence. Mind you, \"The Getaway\" wasn't as intense as \"The Wild Bunch\" and not as heavy-handed philosophically as \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\" Despite its somewhat kinky subplot, \"The Getaway\" is the kind of Peckinpah movie where things go right for the hero and the heroine with an amenable ending.Texas millionaire Jack Benyon (Ben Johnson of \"The Wild Bunch\") needs a top gun to rob one of his banks, and Carter 'Doc' McCoy (Steve McQueen of \"Bullitt\") is going to pieces slowly in Huntsville Prison. Every time that he applies for parole, he gets shot down. Doc gets his wife Carol (Ali MacGraw of \"Love Story\") to get to Johnson. Doc wins his parole, but he thinks that Carol sold him out. Nevertheless, he meets once with Benyon in San Antonio and greets his team of men for the bank heist. They have their conference aboard the little party barges on the Riverwalk tourist attraction. During the planning stages of the robbery, tempers flare between Doc and Rudy Butler (Al Letteri of \"McQ\") about the use of bullet-proof vests. Anyway, Doc cases the bank and they check out its alarm system. Meanwhile, Doc has Rudy and Frank Jackson (Bo Hopkins of \"The Killer Elite\") to plant explosive charges at different ends of town to distract the authorities when the robbery goes down. During the robbery, Frank loses his cool. Our heroes get away with the loot, but Rudy murders Frank and tries to double-cross Doc. Doc is just a little too fast for him. Ironically, despite his boasts of not wearing a bullet-proof vest, Rudy is wearing a vest when Doc nails him and leaves him for dead. Rudy takes an animal doctor (Jack Dodson) and his wife (Sally Struthers of TV's \"All in the Family\") hostage and has the husband dress his wounds. Rudy and company follow Doc and Carol. At Jack Benyon's house, Carol guns Jack down, but Doc doesn't trust her. They head for El Paso with Rudy hot on their trail. \"The Getaway\" represented a personal high for Peckinpah and the film made a killing at the box office. The opening scenes that depict Doc's mental breakdown behind bars are masterful. Lettieri makes a nefarious villain and Ben Johnson is simply dastardly. The final shoot-out in a motel in El Paso is great. When our heroes get to the border, they have to deal with an old cowboy (Slim Pickins) and sells them his truck. A memorable Peckinpah epic.",

            "review_title": "a Peckinpah crime picture through and through; efficient in storytelling, violent as all hell",
            "content": "The Getaway won't bring up too many doctoral theses like the Wild Bunch (at least on its own, maybe as part of a Sam Peckinpah grouping of films dissected), but it's one of the director's best non-Western films. It's got a cracker-jack story that seems like it's been pulled right off the paperback rack at the candy store: an ex-con, Doc McCoy (Steve McQueen) is yanked out of a lengthy jail-term thanks to a Texas mob guy/bank-connection (Ben Johnson), and not in small part due to his wife Carol (Ali McGraw), but it's all in due to a planned bank robbery, which goes off well except that the aftermath gets screwy. McCoy and his girl go off on the run to El Paso, while a creepy lecherous crook, Rudy (Al Lettieri) tries to beat them to the punch after getting shot by McCoy. From there on in Peckinpah via writers Jim Thompson and Walter Hill supplant a bunch of very suspenseful scenes, with the half a million put into peril; McCoy gets his face put on all the papers, making him all too easy. There's mishaps with a garbage truck (a fantastically subversive scene, with the subtext being 'the things I'll do to get money'), and a group attached to Johnson's character who always look like they're waiting for something by the phones. And Rudy, of course, as one of the more nasty villains in Peckinpah's work.All in all the film is mostly made spectacular because Peckinpah doesn't short-change the audience on the goods. This is a work of classy film-making immersed in sleazy circumstances, a Texas heist picture where knowing your guns is a pre-requisite and it's more about knowing how to evade capture and not hedge your bets than real ingenuity. Peckinpah also infuses with this typically pulpy material (Thompson was one of the co-writers on The Killing script) with his trademark visual panache: it's not glamorous violence in any way, but you can't look away from how he makes it brilliant in the pacing (the editing is top-notch and some of the best I've seen in any thriller of the 70s), in everything leading up to a violent moment or contact, and the brutality which can only come from a filmmaker who trusts his audience like this. And it's very wise to have McQueen as McCoy, a true take-no-prisoners anti-hero who may not be the most in-depth criminal mastermind/fugitive, but boy can he be the one to bet on as getting away with it all. McGraw, meanwhile, isn't quite as effective, but then again she's not given a really developed character to work with. How and why she's so attached to McCoy to not leave him is a little faux Bonnie and Clyde, but for the most part I didn't mind.Meanwhile, Peckinpah puts in his supporting ranks some high-caliber talent, with Lettieri doing a lot with so little; his sub-plot involves taking hostage a doctor and his woman, and there's a lot to be read into what happens in this as he starts to over-take the woman, as it were, with real brutish force that puts the doctor into his own end. But the irony isn't lost on Peckipah in his subversive state, and there's a laugh-out-loud moment when there's a cute black kitty sitting on his chest while resting from gun-shot wounds. Then of course there's Johnson, a usual Peckinpah alumni, and a great bit from Slim Pickens towards the end. Featuring a sweet Quincy Jones soundtrack, and a storyline that unfolds where unpredictability is paramount, The Getawat is a better-than-expected thriller where the criminals are hard-edged and dangerous, and where money almost becomes a MacGuffin to bring out the worst in men.",

            "content": "Based on Jim Thompson's novel, The Getaway finds director Sam Peckinpah, and king of cool actor Steve McQueen, turning to hard grit drama after the sedate splendour of Junior Bonner earlier in the year.Doc McCoy is released early from prison due to some string pulling from influential gangster Jack Benyon, however it comes under condition that McCoy pulls off a bank robbery for the gruff smarmy Benyon. Thus the seed is sown for double crosses, murder, cross country pursuits, adultery, and carnage Peckinpah style.Steve McQueen is excellent as McCoy, few actors can claim to look so good when popping off a pump action shotgun, or shooting a pistol complete with arm recoil, and here he has Peckinpah to maximise the damage whilst poetically portraying the slow-mo death sequences. Al Lettieri is vile thug Rudy Butler who is in hot pursuit of McCoy & his wife Carol, a wonderful weasel turn full of cold abusive charm that reeks of menace. Sadly the film is let down a touch by the performance of Ali MacGraw as Carol, it's a terribly wooden performance that threatens to undo all the good things in the film, but luckily McQueen manages to ease her thru the production to minimise the damage.This of course is the film where both of them fell madly in love and ended up getting married to each other, the chemistry is good, but it's just that MacGraw's delivery of her lines lacks emotion or fortitude. Peckinpah disagreed with the critics of the time, even sending a letter to MacGraw praising her efforts. However when she turned up for the shoot unable to drive a car, he was less than pleased since her character was the getaway driver! Full of fine sequences and bloody scenarios, it stands up as a real good Sam Peckinpah picture, it's a kind of city set western where the outlaws are actually coming across as heroes. We get pulled into this couple's world and we want so much for them to achieve their goals, so add that feeling to the gritty structure of the story and you get a real enjoyable piece benefiting from great work from director and charismatic leading man alike. 8/10",

            "content": "When first released, Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway was generally dismissed as a routine action movie, quite unworthy of its star and director. But that opinion of the film is totally wrong: this is far from routine fare. It's a forceful, amoral, tightly editted, violent and nail-bitingly exciting thriller with coolness and style to burn. If anything, Peckinpah was crafting an action movie way ahead of its time; the critics - unsure of what to make of it - took the safe option and castigated it as an average potboiler. McQueen oozes an unnerving, charming aggression as Doc McCoy, a stolid ex-con who is no sooner out of jail than he is back to his criminal ways, robbing a bank with the help of his wife (Ali MacGraw). It would be a spoiler to reveal too many details of the robbery, but it's enough to add that things go wrong and Mr and Mrs McCoy end up fleeing for Mexico, with a stash of cash and a whole bunch of gun-toting bad guys (as well as the cops) in hot pursuit. The film is loosely structured, with the gun-toting couple stumbling from one blood-soaked adventure to the next, picaresque-style, as they attempt to reach the Mexican border. MacGraw looks a bit lost amid all this heavy-weight acting talent, but she gets away with it because she shares a lot of screen time with McQueen.... and when he's on screen, you tend not to notice her (so mesmerising is he that you just can't take your eyes off him). Some of the gunfights are explosive and entertaining affairs, and the characters are brilliantly realised. Peckinpah has a good eye for graphic detail, but he also captures the barren wastelands of Texas with the kind of loving grace that you would usually expect from a landscape painter. The Getaway is a cracking '70s thriller, well worth re-visiting and unquestionably a lot better than the depressingly \"pretty\" '90s remake.",

The hero is a killer and bank robber, he says little and therefore you should have to work hard to empathize with him.  But it comes easy because everyone else around Doc McCoy is ten times worse than he is. And Doc is played by Steve McQueen.  A magnificent brooding presence who's character doesn't stop to question his actions, because if he did he'd die or get arrested.  And this is where it is so much better than a contemporary film of the same vein.  It's not made with actors who are scared that their image might be tarnished or misunderstood, it is not made by film-makers who are scared they might upset someone, it is not made by people who particularly need to be loved.  So what you get is a story that rings true, a piece of fiction that at no time stops to apologize for itself.  It grabs you, says this is what I am, and if you're hooked then great.

Good guy Steve McQueen in here never utters a bad word and is still a tough, no- nonsense kind of guy. The rest of the characters are the same. There are no \"talk before I shoot\" hokey scenes or people missing from point-blank range.McQueen is great, as he usually was, and the rest of the cast is pretty interesting, too, from sleazy Sally Struthers (pre-\"All In The Family\") to Love Story's Ali McGraw to old-timers Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens. Al Letterei was also good in here. His name isn't familiar to me, but his face was.With either this or the re-make, you get a solid crime-action story with \"The Getaway.\"",

THE GETAWAY  is not all that different structure wise but what sets it apart from most movies in the genre is that it`s superbly directed by Sam Peckinpah . From the opening of Doc McCoy suffering hard prison time and having erotic musings about his wife ( Can`t say I blame him either ) you just know this is going to be a great film .\nOnce again Peckinpah uses his unique cross cutting in slo mo between scenes but that`s not the only reason this is a great thriller , it`s also down to the cast . Okay maybe McQueen and McGraw don`t make an entirely convincing on screen couple but compare this to the husband and wife of STRAW DOGS . The one problem Peckinpah seems to have had in his movies is casting convincing on screen couples , is it any coincidence that his best movies like THE WILD BUNCH and CROSS OF IRON have been mainly female free ? Peckinpah also casts Ben Johnson and Bo Hopkins on a regular basis and they both appear here , Johnson plays an oily creep while Hopkins appears very briefly . Without doubt the best casting choice is the late Al Lettieri as Rudy Butler . Lettieri is the sort of actor who exudes menace just by breathing , he doesn`t have to say anything to make you tremble in your boots , he just has to look at you and you know it`s not going to be your day . Who`d be a vet after seeing this movie .If you`ve seen this classic thriller please don`t watch the 1990s remake because it`s utter crap .

This film, right behind PAPILLON, is definitely my favorite McQueen vehicle -- it's a big, BIG film (which makes sense, it takes place in Texas), has an epic feel, yet at the same time is very gritty and very honest in its approach to storytelling. The simplistic yet larger-than-life style of THE GETAWAY makes this flick a great watch on a Saturday Night.Oh, and you can't go wrong with Steve McQueen. At his side is *THE* girl-next-door type, the ultra-likable Ali MacGraw. Their chemistry is very obvious (which would make a lot of sense, the two had an on-set affair which was followed by a five year marriage), and it carries the film. The score, composed by Quincy Jones, hits all the right notes in all the right spots, and is definitely pivotal in giving THE GETAWAY its \"feel.\" The supporting cast couldn't be better-suited to their roles. The bad guys are really bad, and quite despicable. Despite the sinister villains, this early 70s gem has a sense of humor. At times the more \"innocent\" characters are mocked by the situations they find themselves in, much to your amusement or disgust (I, for one, found laugh-out-loud moments all the way through). By the very nature of a McQueen film, the characters are all \"approachable,\" and down to earth in their own strange way. In a nutshell, a simplistically epic film that finds the time to not take itself so seriously. While THE GETAWAY may not be the best to bring out at a movie get-together due to its slightly slow pacing and early 70s narrative (which, unfortunately, due to the breakneck music-video pacing of most \"modern\" films, tends to turn off anyone with a less-than-sufficient attention span), it is definitely worth a purchase, and something that you will be proud to say that you've seen.Long Live McQueen, and Have a RIB, Harold!",

This movie seems almost flawless with its excellently executed car chases, it's suspenseful and exciting shoot-outs, and its riveting emotional sequences. Both McGraw and McQueen make this movie well worth the experience. While it is a violent movie (especially for the year it was released!) its moments of comic relief and even serenity make this movie worthy of any moral person's eyes.Without spoiling the movie, just imagine Bonnie and Clyde with the greatest action/adventure experience ever.

            "content": "'The Getaway' is Sam Peckinpah in gun for hire mode making a commercial heist-gone-wrong/lovers-on-the-run movie. He tried to do something similar later in the Seventies with 'Convoy', but that one strayed too far into studio compromise and was nowhere near as successful on an artistic level. Even though one gets the feeling that the movie's star Steve McQueen was calling the shots, Peckinpah still manages to add some of his trademark flamboyant violence and moral ambiguity to what is, let's face it, essentially an action movie. And I must say it is a very good action movie at that, and one many directors today working in this often tired and lazy genre could learn a thing or two from concerning suspense, drama and genuine excitement. The less you know about Jim Thompson's original novel the more you will enjoy this movie. Walter Hill (future director of 'The Warriors' and 'Southern Comfort') takes most of the basic plot, but leaves out the brilliant final chapter set in the hellish criminal haven El Ray. Apparently this was at the insistence of Steve McQueen who thought it too depressing. I also would guess that McQueen influenced Hill to alter the character of Doc McCoy from the book's charming sociopath to a more traditional tough-but-still-fairly decent career criminal. Maybe McQueen felt more comfortable pulling that style off, which is odd because he showed a lot more depth in Peckinpah's low key 'Junior Bonner'. In this one respect 'The Getaway's inferior 1990s remake was closer to Thompson's original spirit by casting Alec Baldwin in the same role. Anyway, if you forget about the book, and accept this movie for what it is, and not what it might have been it is a taut and impressive thriller. McQueen and the beautiful Ali McGraw (then husband and wife) show some real chemistry and are consistently watchable. Peckinpah uses many of his regular dependable character actors (Bo Hopkins, Dub Taylor) to support them, including a first rate Ben Johnson ('The Wild Bunch') in an uncharacteristically nasty role. Al Letteri ('The Godfather') also impresses as McQueen's conniving colleague, Slim Pickens ('Dr Strangelove') as a helpful old geezer, Sally Struthers ('All In The Family') as a blonde bimbo, and the underrated Richard Bright ('Vigilante', 'Crimewave', 'The Godfather') has a scene stealing bit as a con-man who bites off more than he can chew. 'The Getaway' is by no means Peckinpah's most interesting or impressive movie but it is solid entertainment that is hard to beat, and should be watched by any self-respecting Seventies movie fan.",

This was before the Action-films became exaggerated, instead of having just explosions and being over-explicit there is booth plot and suspense in \"The Getaway\". It let Peckinpah use his well known style, in the way of Boorman\u00b4s \"Point Blank\". The result is pure. Ali McGraw is said to be limited and stiff, but Peckinpah made her solid here. I guess that Steve McQueen never was better than here, even if some wouldn't agree. Some of Peckinpah\u00b4s regular starred (such as Ben Johnson, Slim Pickens, Bo Hopkins and Dub Taylor) which makes it even better today - the impact of Peckinpah is powerful.Rating: 8 of 10.",

Steve McQueen is strong, in his silently brooding, intense way. And he rules the movie. His counterpart (his wife, actually), is played by Ali MacGraw (of \"Love Story\" fame) who is predictably a bit drab, though she fits the mold of the times.So who makes the movie even slightly great? The photographer and editor, and therefore the director, Sam Pickinpaw, who had risen up with \"The Wild Bunch\" and \"Straw Dogs,\" both better films than this one.

The debt is paid with more crime, and so the movie follows the new heist. Parallel to this is the reunification of McCoy with his wife.

The movie is fast, and has a lot of changes and interesting aspects. The settings are great\u2014Texas in the early 1970s\u2014 and the feeling of small crime in the big world makes a great backdrop. McQueen is smart and wily, and a lot of the small parts are strong, especially Slim Pickens at the end.It also sums up the attempts in New Hollywood to be shocking and new. Worth seeing.",

            "review_title": "Exciting McQueen/MacGraw action movie with violent Peckinpah direction",
            "content": "This 1972 action crime movie begins with Steve McQueen (Carter `Doc' McCoy) passing time in prison. The fact that the time is slowly destroying him is creatively directed by Sam Peckinpah with lots of repetitive machine images and stop-action photography. McQueen's inner turmoil is exacerbated by losing a chess match with a fellow inmate and by his destruction of an intricate bridge model he spent a great deal of time building. The plot thickens when McCoy tells his wife to contact the local political boss and tell him that he is for sale and will do anything to get paroled.\nMcQueen gets out and the action is on from this point forward. The bank robbery is screwed up and the leads to the long crazy getaway. McCoy's force partner Rudy, played by Al Lettieri (`Mr. Magestyk,' `The Godfather') has always played the consummate bad guy, and he does not disappoint here. In `The Getaway' Rudy kills the third partner, tries to kill McCoy at the meeting spot and then kidnaps a veterinarian and his wife (Sally Struthers and eventually makes her his girlfriend and her husband, who cannot takes it hangs himself.Like in most Peckinpah films it is the style and the violence that sticks out. There are memorable fisticuff scenes as well has the required explosions and gunshot scenes. Ones that stand out include the all too realistic slaps to the face to Ali MacGraw after Doc learns that he had been set up by her and the incredible beating of a thief played by Richard Bright (`The Panic in Needle Park' and `The Godfather' who unknowingly steals the bank robbery money in a con game in a train station and is eventually caught by McCoy. Also of note are a series of diversionary explosions that are set off right after the bank robbery and an incredible shotgun destruction of a police car. The grand finale in an El Paso hotel is not to be missed. As rough and violent as all of this is it is important to note a quieter more sympathetic side of McCoy that is played my Steve McQueen. On a few occasions he makes it clear to people in his path that if they do what he says, when he says it they will be left alone and therefore survive. Much like in Peckinpah's earlier film, `The Wild Bunch' there is an honor among thieves, or a code of ethics that is important for the protagonist(s) to uphold. Another aspect of this morality is played off in a sarcastic and ironic manner in the last seen. A trash collector played by Slim Pickens (`Dr. Strangelove,' `Blazing Saddles') is willingly kidnapped to assist McQueen and MacGraw cross the border into Mexico. Even though he has a good idea of the kinds of life the criminals are leading Pickens is very happy to hear that the couple is married and he feels that society is falling apart due to a lack of morals. In light of the excessive violence that occurs in this film it is funny that Peckinpah's film comments that all would be morally OK if young people just stick to the traditions of marriage.",

            "content": "Sam Peckinpah does his own version of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" and the result is a cynical, unapologetic heist movie with repellent characters and not an ounce of humor.I didn't enjoy \"The Getaway\" exactly; it's far too nihilistic to enjoy. But I did find it very interesting to compare it to \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" one of the seminal films of the American counter culture. \"Bonnie and Clyde\" was bleak too, and crafted a building sense of impending doom, but it was also tragic. The characters created by Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty were victims of circumstance. They were young kids who got themselves in over their heads and couldn't see their way out. We liked them, even if we didn't like the things they did, and though we maybe wanted to see them brought to justice, we didn't want to see them destroyed.At the other end of the spectrum is \"The Getaway,\" a film in which everyone's a bad guy and we don't like anyone. The brutality toward women and the casual violence inflicted on everyone else is hard to stomach, especially in the absence of a hero to root for. This movie came out after the attitudes of the American counter culture had curdled into the stuff of nightmares (the Manson gang, anyone?) and it's like that disillusionment found its way into Peckinpah's vision and manifests itself on screen. The characters in this movie are who Bonnie and Clyde would have turned into if they had lived.Steve McQueen brings his usual tough-guy coolness to his role, but he plays a vile character. Ali McGraw is simply terrible, wooden as a tree stump. And poor Sally Struthers exists for the sole purpose of being treated horribly.\"The Wild Bunch\" and \"Straw Dogs,\" two other Peckinpah movies that I like a lot, are hard to watch as well, but they both feel like they have something to say about the violence they traffic in, which makes them worth sticking with. I'm not sure \"The Getaway\" has much of anything to say, and the whole thing feels uncomfortably exploitative, even as Peckinpah's irresistible style keeps it entertaining.Grade: B",

            "content": "\"The Getaway\" is an action packed crime thriller which cleaned up at the box office and provided director Sam Peckinpah with the biggest hit of his career. Beyond that, it's also a movie which contains some tense passages, an intriguing series of plot twists and an insight into the strains which affect the relationship of a married couple.With Peckinpah at the helm, it's no surprise that there's plenty of blood and violence in evidence but what's most impressive is the exciting action sequences (car chases, shoot-outs etc) and the proficient style of editing which makes them so spectacular and compelling to watch.Doc McCoy (Steve McQueen), a career thief, finds the constraints of prison life unbearable and is frustrated that despite his good behaviour, he's been refused parole. In desperation he sends his wife Carol (Ali McGraw) to local corrupt politician Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson) to tell him that McCoy is for sale. Beynon (who serves on the parole board) uses his influence and Doc is given his freedom, but it comes at a price.Beynon employs Doc to rob a small town bank for a half share in the proceeds and insists that he uses Rudy Butler (Al Lettieri) and Frank Jackson (Bo Hopkins) to help carry out the heist. Jackson is an unstable character who unnecessarily kills a bank guard and is then killed by Butler when they're making their escape. When Doc and Carol (who'd been travelling in another vehicle) reunite with Butler, he tries to shoot them but Doc shoots first and Butler is left for dead.Doc meets with Beynon and discovers that the bank heist had been organised to cover up the loss of $250,000 which Beynon's brother (a member of the bank's board) had misappropriated. Furthermore, he learns that Carol had slept with Beynon in order to ensure his freedom. Unexpectedly, Carol arrives at the meeting, opens fire and kills Beynon and then the couple go on the run and head for Mexico. Their journey proves to be very hazardous as they are forced to evade the attentions of the police and also get followed by Beynon's brother and his gang. What's more, Rudy Butler had only been injured in his confrontation with Doc and had since kidnapped a veterinarian and his wife and was also following in hot pursuit.The McCoys' pursuers finally catch up with them at an El Paso hotel which is regularly used as a safe house by criminals and a brilliantly staged massive shoot-out follows.Steve McQueen is typically intense and charismatic in one of his most successful roles as a skilled criminal who's furious about what Carol did with Beynon but decides not to leave her. Ali McGraw shows her character's habitual uneasiness and uncertainty and Al Lettieri provides the best supporting performance as an insane killer with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.\"The Getaway\" was based on one of Jim Thompson's novels and is predictably hardboiled in style. It also has a rather grim quality which runs through its entire story and has an ending which would certainly not have been sanctioned during the Production Code era.",

It begin within a maximum Texas prison where one, Carter 'Doc' McCoy, (Steve McQueen) is waiting out his sentence for bank robbery and expects to be released soon. As with most prison systems, it's subject to manipulations from the rich and powerful. In this case we have Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson, with superb acting) who is both. It is he who uses his influence to \"spring\" our hero, with the caveat that he commit a personal bank robbery for him. Each man has much to gain and just as much to lose as there is obvious tension and distrust from the arrangement. What follows is one of the best double-crossing, shoot-'em ups, high speed chases ever created by director Sam Peckenpaw. Along the way, we have a notable college of film stars as could be gather to make a truly memorable saga. For instance, we have Ali MacGraw as Carol McCoy, Al Lettieri as dangerous, vengeful and homicidal Rudy Butler. Slim Pickens as a truck-driving Cowboy.

            "content": "Director Sam Peckinpah was known in the '70's for making violent action movies. Violence that we are used to know but was still all something new and provoking at its time. You could say that he helped to define the genre, since you also have to remember that action wasn't really considered to be much of a genre at the early '70's. There were movies with action sequences in it of course but these often would be put under a more different label, such as thriller, war, adventure or even drama. The action was never what the movies were fully truly were about, while Sam Peckinpah movies were.Still Peckinpah movies also have an amazing depth to it, due to the way they are being build up and the story is being told. \"The Getaway is a movie with criminals and action in it but at the same time the story also manages to be a love drama, when the relationship of the two main characters of the movie is being put under pressure. The two of them float away from each other and at times they are clinging on to each other again, since after all they seemed to be made for each other and form a perfect couple.Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw form this love duo and even though MacGraw wasn't much of a great actress, the two still form one of the best and strangely also sweetest screen couples. In real life McQueen and MacGraw would also marry one year later but like most Hollywood marriages it ended in divorce, only a few years later.McQueen is of course perfectly cast, as he is undoubtedly being the king of cool and all. McQueen was one of the only actors who could do dull and lame stuff and still making it like extremely cool. But he is not the only great actor in the movie. Even though Slim Pickens plays a very small part, it still is a very memorable one, which is for most part due to his great performance of it. Al Lettieri was one of the greatest '70's movie villains, which villainous roles in movies such as \"The Godfather\" and \"Mr. Majestyk\" as well, before his early death in 1975. It was not just his acting that often made him a memorable villain but also certainly his menacing look helped a lot. Other fine actors that appear in this movie are Richard Bright and Ben Johnson, among others.It's a real '70's movie, meaning that it has some renewing editing and camera-work. It's a fast cut movie, with an average shot length of 3.5 seconds. This of course helps making this a real action movie, for the movie itself isn't even really action filled with shoot outs or car chases. It above all things remains a movie that relies on its well written script, that is given real depth by the directing approach of Sam Peckinpah and the acting performances of the lead cast.A superior constructed and told action-flick from the early '70's.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Latter-day \"Bonnie & Clyde\" fable with Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw taking the leads in Sam Peckinpah's typically brutal, uncompromising heist / road movie.A meandering but nonetheless action-packed story of moral redemption, the conclusion here differs from Arthur Penn's earlier classic by granting the McQueen/McGraw characters survival at the end, their personal differences apparently resolved, as they head on into Mexico to start presumably a new life on the proceeds of the botched \"thieves-fall-out\" bank job they pulled at the start of the movie. If that upbeat conclusion jars a little, that's probably because Penn got the better ending first in his movie, but also because, by the end of their tortuous journey, both physical and spiritual, you still don't feel that either of them, for all their star-playing, are admirable or likeable people. Some villains you actually don't want to get away and I'd have been quite happy, based on the preceding evidence in the movie, if the two of them had got some sort of come-uppance at the end.For a heist film to work requires a premium of cool which of course is second nature to McQueen who is fine in his usual laconic way, even if his \"method\" delivery highlights the one-dimensionality of his character. I actually quite liked McGraw's performance as the doe-eyed beauty who doesn't shirk from sleeping with Mr Big, to ensure McQueen gets his early parole release and then shooting him in cold blood, just as McQueen learns this, to prefigure the killing spree which later follows. Her part must have been physically demanding and she holds up well, even if she does seem a little young for the part (but then of course life imitated art, as the screen couple became real-life lovers, so what do I know about compatibility?!).There are many effective sequences, the opening, almost silent scene-setting at the prison as McQueen's frustrated \"Doc\" concludes he'll pay any price to get out (thus setting up McGraw for her fall), the episode where McQueen retrieves the case with the money on board the train, after McGraw's been conned by a shyster, (very crisply done, with hardly any graphic violence), the scene in the compactor where the on-the-run couple are literally up to their necks in it and finally their fortunate encounter with a frankly wacky Slim Pickens who drives them across the border like a Duke of Hazzard five years too soon.Less savoury are the scenes where the treacherous gang-member Rudy, hot on Doc & his missus' trail, kidnaps a young doctor and his slatternly wife and then proceeds to tie up the poor guy and make him watch their love-making. Perhaps this is the old \"Straw Dog\" Peckinpah returning to its own vomit, but I found it completely distasteful and gratuitous, never mind demeaning to women, even in context. A fine performance by the way, perhaps the best on show, delivered almost mute in fact, by Jack Dodson as the hapless husband.The much-parodied \"slow-motion ballet\" which characteristically accompanies the extreme violence in most of Peckinpah's films is either effective or played out depending on your perception of Peckinpah's art (I think I tend to the former on this occasion, it's pretty well rendered here) and there's no arguing with his depiction of little-town America, including for example, its corrupt police force and also shopkeepers who'll unblinkingly sell you a shotgun for spot cash.In conclusion then, a tough, very adult movie with no soft underbelly, not easy to watch, but not easy to stop watching either...",

Sam Peckinpah does not seem to be the most accomplished director but really , when you have Mcqueen and MacGraw on show , most people wont notice. Their on screen chemistry is superb which is not surprising as they fell in love on set and later married. There does seem to be a constant air of sexism bordering on Masogonism in this film , something you don't see to often in older films.

            "content": "In the 1930s and 40s, quite a few heist films were made. However, due to the tough Production Code, the movies were amazingly non- violent and evil always was punished eventually. Starting in the 1960s with films like \"Bonnie and Clyde\", the studios changed the genre completely. Now, because of this films and a few other violent films of the era, bad guys could be anti-heroes, the violence level was cranked up several notches and the audience in many cases had no idea if evil would ever be punished. Director Sam Peckinpah benefited from this new film morality and \"The Getaway\" is a film in this new tradition...a tradition where the line between the good guys and the bad is DEFINITELY blurred!When the story begins, Doc McCoy (Steve McQueen) is in prison for his part in an armed robbery. When he comes up for parole after four years, he's denied...yet, oddly, the decision is reversed and he is freed. Why? Because the Warden is organizing a bank robbery and he needs Doc's skills. Unfortunately, many things go wrong in the robbery and folks involved in the holdup start dying. This is only the first third of the film and the final portion involves Doc and his wife (Ali McGraw) and their attempt to get away scot-free.With Sam Peckinpah and being made in the 1970s, it's not at all surprising that this film is violent and several gallons of blood are spilled. According to IMDb, the director and his notoriously difficult leading man argued a lot during the filmmaking...and the studio always backed McQueen. I assume had Peckinpah been SOLE director it actually would have been even bloodier. But like you'd expect in a McQueen picture, there is LOTS of driving mayhem...lots of shootouts...lots of action. It's like all the action of \"Bullit\" and a dozen other McQueen films shoved into one! Now this is not to say there isn't much in the way of story...there is. And it has enough novelty that it keeps the viewer wondering what's going to happen next. Well worth seeing, though if it has a fault that it is a tad overlong and the action seems a bit more important than the plot.By the way, Slim Pickens makes an appearance near the end...and it's VERY memorable!",

            "content": "As this film ably demonstrates, literally and symbolically, if you aim a shotgun at a big enough target, you're gonna hit something. This film takes a lot of the more controversial and distasteful aspects of \"The Wild Bunch\" and \"Straw Dogs\" and presents them devoid of all philosophical content. It's a triumph of style over substance. I get it -- in 1972, McQueen and Peckinpah were both in need of a box-office hit. So they got Ali McGraw, who can't act to save her life but manages to get halfway there in this film, and off they go on a crime spree. Author David Weddle noted in his book on Peckinpah that the director made off with about $500,000 at the end of the day -- the same amount McQueen and McGraw's characters made from the heist. Fitting.It's not a \"bad\" movie.... the performances are underwhelming, pretty much all around (Ben Johnson disappears too quickly to make much more than an impression), but the action scenes are compelling and the suspense is strong. The story does not make a lot of sense.... for example, Johnson's character is sitting there in the house with all that loot just waiting for McQueen, under the assumption that McQueen's wife is going to betray him. This powerful, cynical man had no back- up plan whatsoever? Time and again, Peckinpah puts pedal to the metal and blasts right through story and character logic, but we don't mind too much.It's sort of a high-class drive-in movie.... not quite as much mayhem as \"Gone in 60 Seconds\", but close. McQueen and McGraw are a super sexy couple, and there's an amusing (although sadistic) side story with Sally Struthers and the suitably disgusting Al Lettieri. It's the sort of film Jack Hill would make if he had a bit more money; the stuff that Tarantino fans' dreams are made of.",

MacGraw can't act but she looks hot as McQueen's wife (a role she played off-screen as well after this film).

The two central characters (McQueen and MacGraw) that we follow throughout the movie, for one thing, aren't terribly likable. They not only abuse in various ways assorted people along their journey, they also subject each other to abuse as well. Yet oddly, while you'll dislike them, they are interesting enough that you can't help but keep watching to see how they will end up. Another interesting factor is that the movie seems to be commenting on masculinity - what makes a man a true man, and how a man should act in various situations. I don't want to spoil things, but I will mention it's seen with both McQueen and MacGraw as well as the subplot with Lettieri. You might not agree with director Sam Peckinpah and scripter Walter Hill on their opinions on masculinity or how lead characters should act, but what they have to say is definitely interesting, and just one aspect of why \"The Getaway\" is worth a look.",

The perfect widescreen photography, quick editing (but not a blur, I should add) and dramatic use of slow-motion give the action in The Getaway an authentic edge. And all done on a low-budget too.Adapted from a Jim Thompson novel by Walter Hill (his macho characteristics are all in there), the story has newly-freed jailbird Carter McCoy forced into a bank robbery by crime boss Jack Benyon. He's also forced to work with rank amateur Frank and psychotic renegade Rudy. You can tell that this dost not bode well.Rudy goes haywire, killing everyone in sight but is soon put out of action by McCoy, who then legs it across country with his cheating wife (the lovely Ali McGraw) and a bag full of simoleons. Down, but not out, Rudy follows him, as well as several associates of the recently deceased Jack Benyon, not to mention loads of cops.The film is basically one action scene after the other but it doesn't pretend to be anything other than tough-guy entertainment. I find it bizarre that this film is rated PG in America and the exact same version is rated 18 in the UK. But the blood effects in the film are pretty damn fake so it does take it out of reality a little bit. Plus there are no (audible) F-words and the nudity is minimum and quick.I saw the 1994 remake first and while it's passable it's not really as rustic and straight-forward as this. It was quite a pointless film and virtually identical, shot-for-shot. Everything that The Getaway has to offer is done best in this one. Unpretenious fun indeed.",

            "content": "For Ali MacGraw, love means never having to say you're sorry, even when you rob a bank, shoot bad guys, and sleep with a parole board member to spring your husband from jail.That's some of what Carol McCoy (Ali) does for hubby Doc (Steve McQueen) in \"The Getaway\", Sam Peckinpah's version of the relationship drama complete with car chases, shoot-em-ups, and tearful reconciliations in junkyards. It's a surprisingly effective film that contrasts the McCoys' troubled union with a seedy, sordid world where life and love are to be had cheap, Texas is one big institutionalized prison, and the only freedom is to be found across the border in Mexico.For people who don't know Peckinpah films, this is a good one to see either just before or after \"The Wild Bunch\", with which \"Getaway\" shares many qualities. Both start with a similar freeze-frame credit sequences, both feature bank jobs gone wrong (and preceded by town parades), both shift back and forth between pursuer and prey, and both have Mexico as a final destination. The difference is that \"The Getaway,\" for all its gritty moments to assure us Sam hasn't gone soft, allows for a sense of hope and future missing from \"The Wild Bunch\".Good things about this film include McQueen (along with \"Bullitt\" his most iconic part), Al Littieri as the psycho Rudy, Sally Struthers as Rudy's all-too-willing hostage Fran, real location shooting by \"Wild Bunch\" collaborator Lucien Ballard that sets up the film's desperate tone, and a score by Quincy Jones that isn't memorable in itself but effective in the way it sets up the picture. The harmonica work by Toots Theilemans feels in-between two of Q's better scores: \"In The Heat Of The Night\" and \"Sanford And Son\".On the debit side is a script that feels cobbled together, Ben Johnson's too-short supporting work as the menacing shadow-figure Beynon, a plug-ugly supporting cast that makes Dub Taylor look like Rod Taylor, and some oddly flat action sequences. Others also knock MacGraw, but I won't. She adds oodles of sex appeal and plays well off McQueen in the central relationship, compensating for some lame line readings with the way her eyes light up when he punches the gas in their car.What makes the film work best for me is that it is a Peckinpah movie that doesn't do what you expect from a Peckinpah movie. There's violence and boys-will-be-boys brutality, but the director also plays cagily against your expectations by allowing room for warmth and gentleness. McQueen's cool, but he cares. The real-life romance between McQueen and MacGraw attracted lots of filmgoers in 1972, but the film plays against the actors' hotitude by making them shy and awkward around one another, more worried about what's going on in each other's head than between the sheets.Peckinpah even has some romantic dialogue, though not exactly Rick and Ilsa:Him: \"You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things are. Maybe we should split up.\"Her: \"Well I don't want to.\"Later...Her: \"I think if we ever get out of this dump, I'll just split.\"Him: \"We've made it together so far.\"Not Hallmark Channel material, but it displays a deeper emotional investment from Peckinpah in the inner lives of his characters, one recognizable to anyone who has been through a relationship. Beyond the bullets and bloodshed, that's what \"The Getaway\" is about, and why it works. Love doesn't excuse you from apologizing, but it's nice to know it rewards you for trying.",

            "content": "I know Sam Peckinpah's \"Getaway\" is likely to generate calls for boycott or censorship because of the infamous scene where Steve McQueen slaps Ali McGraw not once but several times, even looking for hitting her face with a closed fist, but when you're aware of some backstories, you know the scene works.I was astonished by how severe in a disappointingly shallow way the film was initially reviewed despite its commercial success (second after \"The Godfather\"). Roger Ebert, who loved \"The Wild Bunch\" and \"The Ballad of Cable Hogue\", seemed only concerned by the contrivances in the 'heist' and 'shootout' parts. Yet there's more in the film than robbing a bank, escaping with the sound of screeching sound tires and explosive shotguns, there's more than the usual standards of action movies, what the film got was sexual tension, so palpable you could cut through it.\n \n \"Doc\" McCoy is a convict trying to get parole in the midst of a boring and alienating daily routine, improvising scale models in his cell, playing chess or working at a driving license plates' factory. The machinery, pondered by Quincy Jones' jazzy score, gets quickly on our nerves, working as a perfect metaphor of some deep psychological turmoil. Or is it sentimental?While many criminals or antiheroes seem more telegenic as loners or women's men, Doc has a wife, not a girlfriend. This is a true relationship but one that wouldn't survive for too long if McCoy stays in jail. He asks Carol to to tell Benyon (a Texan big shot with a nasty looking crew played by Ben Johnson) he would accept any offer. In an amusing ellipse, a sexily dressed Carol joins Benyon off-screen and the scene cuts to Doc's release, whatever happened in-between works like a ticking bomb, we know it.The park scene is one of these quiet poetic moments not so rare with not-so-tough Peckinpah (like the picnic in \"Alfredo Garcia\"). As McCoy watches people sunbathing, swimming, and snuggling, he imagines he and Carol doing the same. Is he mirroring Sam's own perception of a talent wasted for violence? The way imaginary visions overlap with reality shows a real psychological struggle after four years of repressed emotionality... and sensuality, only McQueen could still look cool with a block, only Sam could be sentimental in a macho flick. After the bucolic interlude, we get some awkward conversations, a few confidences and the ice seems broken the following morning when Doc is cooking breakfast. If you think the robbery or the chase will be the next main story, you'll be surprised, the other focus is also a romance albeit more \"conventional\" by Peckinpah standards.Doc is assigned two partners for a robbery, a disposable one played by a youngish Bo Hopkins and one of the meanest looking mugs of the seventies, Al Lettieri who was born to play the \"baddest guy\", as good a match for Brando and Pacino in \"The Godfather\" as a nemesis for McQueen. His character Rudy is wounded after trying to double-cross Doc who was quicker at the draw... he finds a meek and recluse veterinarian named Harold, and in his slutty blonde wife Fran (Sally Struthers) an unexpected object of sensual attraction. In a scene that wasn't played for subtlety, she sensually caresses his gun, telling him he doesn't need to point it at her... not that gun away. The parallels between the couples were fascinating and I loved how the beta one had a growing chemistry while at the same moment, Doc is slapping the hell out of Carol after he finds out how he got the ticket for freedom. She makes things worse when she almost loses the loot in the train station after being conned by another \"Godfather\" alumni. Unlike Richard, she wasn't so \"bright\" within the circumstances, but she had an attitude.Sam makes us think! a woman like Fran gave her body for nothing, Carol sold her own for her husband's freedom and he's got the nerve to accuse her. Now is he bitter because his wife is a slut or because he couldn't get clean without soiling the woman he loved the most? The two relationships reach pivotal moments. Harold, the cuckold husband after one humiliation too many, hangs himself much to Fran and Rudy's indifference. Later, Doc and Carol finally reestablish their relationship. They decide to move forward and leave the past behind or where it belongs, in the most adequate place: a garbage dump. So we have a \"good couple / bad couple\" situation, but both on the wrong side from the law and the closest thing to a moral scope is marriage. The climactic shootout is another instance where the maverick director proved his mastery of action but after \"The Wild Bunch\" and \"Straw Dogs\", there's not much new stuff to praise, though I enjoyed the cameo of Dub Taylor, that hilarious punch Struthers got for not keeping her mouth shut. As sad as it was, I guess Rudy's death was the perfect revenge of Karma for what Fran did to her husband. Karma-wise, it's also appropriate that the last helping hand comes from an old-fashioned cowboy played by Slim Pickens (another great cameo) who rants about the lack of morality and marital commitment while describing his wife as a pillar in his life, for that, he gets a great retribution.But I wasn't glad that the good couple could get away it with the money, but because they did it together, but maybe Ali McGraw should have learned a lesson from the film. She treated producers Robert Evans like Fran with Harold, she couldn't resist McQueen who revealed himself to be quite a \"Rudy\" with her.... and her career was derailed like Fran's life.That fact of life made the sexual tension believable because the actors didn't play it, but it's crazy how truth can be stranger than fiction, bitchier too.",

            "content": "It's a shame that an actor like Steve McQueen, obsessed with maintaining an image, is allowed final cut here. Whenever the camera settles on him I feel like I'm called to admire the impenetrable cool exterior of the silent action hero. In a Leone film this works, here sometimes it doesn't. This is of course McQueen's fault but Peckinpah must still share the brunt of the commercial action film McQueen thinks he's making. Stephen King said about the Peckinpah film that \"if you have seen only the film version of The Getaway, you have no idea of the existential horrors awaiting Doc and Carol McCoy at the point where Sam Peckinpah ended the story\". I'm incredibly intrigued about that final chapter left out by the movie, something about the couple on the run arriving at a den of iniquity in Mexico no doubt to enact their parts in a tragedy, just the same though I can still recognize existential horrors in Peckinpah's film that make me fear for the characters' souls.I love it when we get the cracks in the mask. When for example, in the opening prison sequence, Peckinpah freezes McQueen clutching his face with both hands in a portrait of anguish and despair. Without any more words needed, I can see why this man will step out to meet his wife in the following scene telling her to go to the sheriff and ask him his price, not even knowing yet that the price is not only his own price to be fixed and gambled upon in a game of chance but also a price which can never be paid back in full. This is the existential horror for me, a life changed in the chance toss of the coin or the flip of the card. When McQueen becomes frustrated with the game of chess he's playing with an old prison inmate and strikes at the pawns, the old man tells him that \"it's just a game\". Ali McGaw later reminds him, among mounds of garbage, that it's all a game. But a game can only be as real as the stakes. In this sense I'm very glad Sam Fuller never got to make the picture instead of Peckinpah. Peckinpah knows fatalism in the bottle of his whiskey, and in this movie he tells us that some things can never be made right again.I hear a lot of people have a problem with Ali McGraw. She's a good reason why I can love this film and Convoy. Here, unlike McQueen, we see the cracks in the mask. I don't like Meryl Streeps. I like my actresses to be like my favourite actors, at their most profound to be mute faces that say all there is to be said. I love the expressive eyes here, she gives a terrific performance even as (or perhaps precisely because) she doesn't quite know how to give one. I feel that a lesser actress who hasn't yte mastered the art of pretending to be other persons can't help but reveal glimmers of personal truth. How terrifying then to know that McQueen did beat up Ali McGraw in real life and then turn to look at the pain in her eyes, this almost an act of prophecy, of how much she would be hurt if the man she loves did actually strike at her.The fascinating thing in this on screen relationship which after a hiatus four years long must be resumed on the run, inside beatup cars, fleabag motels and driveins, even inside garbage trucks, is that it's as likely to last forever as it is for them to break up the next moment and go their separate ways. In an almost unthinkable manner for a Peckinpah film, The Getaway is not just about an end to a world, it's also about new beginnings. This is not Peckinpah's natural environment though, so we don't get what it takes for that new beginning to be made possible. Surely it's more than a matter of gunning down deputies and giving out $30k for a beatup truck, but we don't quite arrive at the meaningful point of departure. This is not the gritnik poetry that is Alfredo Garcia, but as gritnik cinema it's near the top looking down.",

He knew how to convey the taste and smell of a gunfight through mere sound and vision and he could stamp his own style on typically grim, early 70's, neo-realistic movie making . In short the guy could direct - and how! But in THE GETAWAY, this isn't enough to overcome a drab script and the sullen uninvolving presence of Ali McGraw. The result is a film with many good points, some occasionally poetic images and a dose of down to earth grit, but nothing that the viewer can really grab hold of. The Steve McQueen character, Doc, is just \"Frank Bullet\" on the wrong side of the law. It's stock McQueen, turn-of-the-70's fare. But whereas \"Bullett\" had that famous car chase, the complex dark edged plot and McQueen as a good guy doing his best, here, he's a 'bad guy' on the run from even worse bad guys and the whole thing leaves you not caring very much who shoots who in the end. You can take your pick on whether McQueen was just wooden or an absolute master on minimalist acting. He doesn't express very much , there's no wild hysterics, no mugging, no screaming and crying, but what there is, leaves you believeing a great deal more is going on beneath the slightly strained expression that meets the eye. As a smouldering, quiet, anti-hero he had few equals. He's not acting, he's being. McQueen is not the problem with this movie. Ali McGraw, on the other hand, looks as if she arrived on set only to be told she'd signed up to work for free! She's dull, sullen, lethargic and lacking in sex-appeal.It's just going through the motions. She looks as if she rates the whole deal of robbing a bank equal with doing the week's shopping and there's no chemistry whatsoever between her and McQueen.They frankly don't seem to care for each other at all! The sub-plot of her infidelity is simply a bunch of throw away lines. In a better script, and with better casting, it would have turned the entire movie round. Given it the edge it is missing. Visually it all looks great. There is no denying the directors eye for a strong image and the set pieces all work superbly. But frankly it's hard to give a damn at the end. The characters simply do not hold the viewers interest.You just KNOW what will happen and you just don't care.",

            "content": "I have never read Jim Thompson's novel on which this film is based, and if Ewnnrj's synopsis is an accurate account of its plot line I can't say that it will be anywhere near the top of my list of books to read before I die. I can, however, understand why Sam Peckinpah, a director notorious for the violent content of his films, should have been attracted to such a story. Whether a film which kept the book's original ending would have passed muster with the censors of the early seventies is another matter. (It was, apparently, changed at Steve McQueen's insistence). The film that actually was made is quite violent enough.Earlier the same year Peckinpah had made another film, \"Junior Bonner\" (a surprisingly mild one by his standards), also with McQueen. In \"The Getaway\" he plays Carter \"Doc\" McCoy, a criminal currently serving time in jail for armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. Anxious to be reunited with his beautiful young wife Carol, McCoy reaches a deal with a corrupt local political boss, Jack Beynon. Beynon will use his influence to ensure that McCoy gets parole. In return, McCoy will pull off one last bank robbery and split the proceeds with Beynon.McCoy recruits a gang and organises the crime with great precision; the actual robbery scene is one of Peckinpah's great violent set-pieces, like the similar robbery which opens his earlier film \"The Wild Bunch\". After making their getaway, however, McCoy and Carol realise that Beynon has set them up. One of the gang, Rudy (who has already murdered another gang member) pulls a gun on them, but McCoy's reflexes are quicker and he is able to empty five shots into Rudy, leaving him apparently dead. McCoy and Carol flee, but Rudy has survived thanks to a bullet-proof vest and pursues them.The film has some other similarities with \"The Wild Bunch\". Although \"The Getaway\" has a contemporary setting and \"The Wild Bunch\" a historical one, both feature a team of bank robbers making a getaway through the sun-baked, dusty deserts of the American South-West and into Mexico. In both cases the fugitives have been set up and are being pursued by desperadoes even more ruthless than themselves. Both films show that Peckinpah's reputation for violence was well-deserved, with plenty of shootout sequences (generally in slow motion), although the body-count in \"The Getaway\" is not quite as high as in the earlier film. Both films feature a certain amount of grim humour, much of it in \"The Getaway\" deriving from a sub-plot in which Rudy kidnaps a married couple as hostages and finds that the wife, suffering from a terminal case of Stockholm Syndrome, falls in love with him. There is also that ironical scene near the end where the old dustman is happy to help Doc and Carol when he finds out that they are legally married. Pre-marital sex is, in his book, clearly a worse crime than robbery.Peckinpah is sometimes (with some justification) regarded as a misogynistic director. Many of his films either have a virtually all-male cast (\"The Wild Bunch\", \"Cross of Iron\") or portray women as the victims of violence or degradation (\"Straw Dogs\"). \"The Getaway\", however, is a rarity in his work in that it has a major female character at the centre of the action.Ali MacGraw was regarded as a big-name star in the seventies, although her body of work was surprisingly small. \"The Getaway\" was only her fourth film, and it was to be another six years before she appeared in her fifth (\"Convoy\", also directed by Peckinpah). After her dreadful performance in that sentimental tearjerker \"Love Story\" she will never be my favourite actress, but I must say that she is much better in \"The Getaway\". Unusually for a crime thriller, the film is also a love story of a sort, a portrait of the marriage of Doc and Carol. Their mutual love and sexual attraction come through very strongly- unsurprisingly given that McQueen and MacGraw fell in love while making the film and were married soon afterwards- although their relationship is put under strain when it is revealed that Carol slept with Beynon as part of the deal to secure her husband's freedom.McQueen plays Doc in his usual cool, laconic manner. McQueen had played another bank robber a few years earlier in \"The Thomas Crown Affair\", and although the two films are miles apart in terms of visual style, they have one thing in common in that he is able to make his character a sympathetic one despite his criminal tendencies. The other characters in this film, especially Beynon and Rudy, are all so vicious that the audience are hoping that Doc and Carol will get away with it. (I won't say if they do).Despite the claims that are sometimes made for Peckinpah as a \"serious\" director, I have never found him a particularly profound one; he generally found it easier to depict violence than to say anything serious about it or to examine its causes. The war film \"Cross of Iron\" may be an exception, but \"The Getaway\" is not. It is, however, a well-photographed fast-moving and often enjoyable action-adventure with a surprisingly sympathetic and attractive couple at its centre. 6/10",

After the heist goes awry, Doc and his dutiful wife Carol (a solid and affecting performance by the lovely Ali MacGraw) go on the run.Director Sam Peckinpah, working from a hard-hitting script by Walter Hill, tells the gripping story with remarkably meticulous detail and precision (the fumbled robbery and a harrowing set piece that takes place inside of a garbage truck in particular rate as total pips), vividly evokes a harsh world in which both loyalty and morality are completely up for grabs, generates plenty of nerve-rattling tension, and stages the rousing action set pieces with breathtaking skill. Moreover, the strained romantic relationship between Doc and Carol gives this film a surprising amount of genuinely touching heart. The top-rate supporting cast helps a lot: Al Lettieri as scurvy double-crossing brute Rudy Butler, Sally Struthers as ditsy slut Fran Clinton, Jack Dodson as Fran's meek husband Harold, Bo Hopkins as sleazy hotel owner Laughlin, Richard Bright as a weaselly small-time thief, Bo Hopkins as the easygoing Frank Jackson, and Slim Pickens as a helpful good ol' boy pick-up truck driver. The get-down funky score by Quincy Jones hits the right-on groovy spot. Lucien Ballard's crisp widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. But it's the impressive way that Peckinpah grounds everything in a sordidly plausible everyday reality that in turn makes this movie quite resonant and powerful. A real corker.",

Put him and star Steve McQueen in with a screenplay by future action director Walter Hill (48 HRS.) from a classic Jim Thompson book, and you've got the makings of a very well-made piece.McQueen stars as Carter \"Doc\" McCoy, a career criminal who has served four years of a ten-year prison sentence in Texas for armed robbery.  He is given early parole by the parole board chairman (Ben Johnson)...but on one condition: He and two associates (Bo Hopkins, Al Lettieri) must rob a bank without killing anybody!  Initially, the operation seems to be working; but when Hopkins kills a guard he had disabled, everything goes haywire. Lettieri kills Hopkins almost immediately after they leave the bank.  And when McQueen wounds Lettieri after learning what happened to Hopkins (\"He didn't make it.  Neither did you\" is Lettieri's response), the stage is set for a motor-and-blood-driven chase across the Lone Star State.  And yet there is still one thing McQueen hadn't counted upon: his wife (Ali MacGraw) getting it on with Johnson to facilitate McQueen's early release.  The Peckinpah theme of betrayal rears its head here.Many bursts of violence, car chases, and a hair-raising scene in a garbage truck later, McQueen and MacGraw reconcile, and then face off with Lettieri and Johnson's minions in a gut-grabbing, suspenseful shootout in El Paso.McQueen's low-key style of acting, displayed many times before, notably in his 1968 smash BULLITT, comes to the fore once again in THE GETAWAY, under Peckinpah's hard-hitting direction.  MacGraw's performance has been heavily slammed, but I don't think it is nearly as bad as many have made it out to be.  Excellent cinematography from Lucien Ballard and a taut, R&B-style music score by Quincy Jones (substituted for a Jerry Fielding score at McQueen's insistence) help immeasurably, as does the on-location shooting in Texas.  Peckinpah has also loaded the film with cohorts like Johnson, Slim Pickens, John Bryson, Jack Dodson, and Dub Taylor doing typically fine cameo roles.  Although it may be long at 123 minutes, THE GETAWAY is nevertheless a superior action/suspense film from Peckinpah, THE modern master of the form.",

What makes the film so excellent, in addition to its well-crafted, well-directed and mostly well-acted story, is the use of location filming, tense chase scenes that give us action-action- action...and a smattering of supporting players (many having found greater fame on television by the time they were cast in these roles) that give the story flavor, energy and colorful characterization. Among these folks, I want to mention Jack Dodson as a hostage forced to drive; Dub Taylor as a seedy motel manager; Slim Pickens as a cowboy; and of course, Sally Struthers as Fran, a wannabe Bonnie Parker whose heart inevitably gets broken on the run. Struthers should have had a supporting actress nomination, because she is that good. Do not miss the rib-throwing scene about two-thirds of the way through the movie. It's classic.As for the leads, I understand they fell in love during the making of this picture and divorced their respective spouses to marry each other. To say they share a special chemistry is underestimating the laws of physical attraction. I expected MacGraw to be a bit of a pushover, but she is given some powerful moments where her character explodes and gets exploded at. She is deceptively calm and then when she faces a crisis, we are wondering how she will react, and if she will ever fully self-destruct. McQueen is perfectly cool, and there is a great scene where the runaway couple emerges from a pile of trash that has been dumped along a gulch in a remote waste site. In this scene, we see him stand up, grab the bag of money and his rifle, then move off with MacGraw as only he can. Nothing rumples him. In fact, nothing rumples this movie.

Kudos to Steve for not caring about Hollywood looks. However, I would recommend a few thespian lessons for McGraw. She's a whole lot prettier than she is accomplished.

Sure, he's not the most consistent writer (or director, for that matter) on the planet, but his best work has a wonderful sort of gritty charm. Sam Peckinpah is probably the best choice to direct a typical 70's Walter Hill script other than, well, Walter Hill himself. \"The Getaway\" is a massively entertaining crime thriller, a blisteringly fast-paced showcase for Peckinpah's distinctive style and for the sort of morally ambiguous script that Hill writes so well. \"The Getaway\" is tremendously entertaining, sure, but it is also really gritty and far, far removed from the standard glitzy fluff that makes up the majority of heist films.Something like \"The Getaway\" has to feature performances that leave an impression for it to work. The characters, which Hill's script focuses on enough but doesn't obsess over, need to be believable for one to care about what is happening to them. How many times have you watched a mildly entertaining heist flick and ultimately come away from it not caring even remotely about what just happened? \"The Getaway\" doesn't just have the right amount of depth and grit script-wise, it also features a confident and mature performance from Steve McQueen, who plays a morally ambiguous anti-hero in this film. It's one of his better performances, I think, and one of the better characters he played. The rest of the cast are all good as well.The action is great, as one can expect from Peckinpah. The final shootout is especially memorable and McQueen just looks great with that rifle. This is the sort of screen presence most 'movie stars' could only hope to have. Peckinpah's handling of the quieter scenes is equally strong, and the film moves at a blinding pace. I could barely believe it was two hours long. \"The Getaway\" is a tremendous crime thriller. On my first viewing I didn't take to it, but six viewings later and it's one of my favorite crime films from the 70's. Really well-acted, well-directed, and well-written film, and one which is simultaneously one of the decade's most involving and entertaining features and one of its grittiest heist films. 9/10",

            "content": "The Heist is a landmark action film. It is surprising that it is so overlooked. It looms large over the film action genre over the past two decades. Almost every action film owes something to this remarkable masterpiece by Peckinpah at the the height of his directorial powers. For starters, the garbage compactor scene was directly lifted by George Lucas in Star Wars. The dialogue, pacing, and editing are stamped all over Tarantino's films. The action sequences are the starting point for John Woo's Triad masterpieces. A few movies that bear out the direct influence include Point Break (which the story and action sequences are similar); as well as Ben Affleck's The Town.The script by a then up and coming Walter Hill, based upon a Jim Thompson novel, is perfection in itself. In fact, all of Hill's movies can be tied in one way or another to his screenplay in The Getaway. In fact I don't think it's a stretch to say the brash direction and machismo was a defining influence on Takeshi Kitano's directorial career.By all means, if you are a film lover and have not seen this one, you are indeed lucky to be able to see it for the first time. Usually, Peckinpah is defined by critics with his film The Wild Bunch and by general consensus - consider it his best. After seeing this film, it is no longer true for me - this is Peckinpah's finest hour. McQueen shows why he is still regarded as a legend - a simply unforgettable performance.",

The fine book was Jim Thompson and Walter Hill did the screenplay while the dialogue is fantastic even though there is plenty of non stop action and both Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw are really good. The couple are great together in the tough and tender times and Peckinpah's even has the time for humorous moments. It is a splendid film throughout and with all that is going on there is still the amusing (and terrible) scenes of the silly wife and husband and the last minutes for the finding of a truck.",

            "content": "I only knew of Sam Peckinpah for his violent movie themes. I saw \"Straw Dogs\" many years ago and found it a satisfying movie but was unimpressed by its violent ending. This movie, on the other hand, shows another side to Peckinpah. The prison life is depicted as a hell of regimentation. The watchtower is shown as the camera moves upward toward the armed guard above watching over the inmates. Inside the institution, Doc McCoy's request for parole is handled as another rubber stamp decision that leaves him angry and humiliated. At this point, Carol McCoy springs into action and at Doc's urging arranges his release by selling herself to one of the prison authorities, the corrupt Ben Johnson. The relationship between McQueen and MacGraw (Carol and Doc McCoy)is skilfully handled. McCoy's first taste of freedom is blended into a scene where the two stop at a riverbank and find children swimming and couples kissing and lunching. There is an illusion of the two of them jumping into the water and hugging one another, as the scene switches back to the two looking on from the riverbank. Soon,the two are together in the water and embrace one another for the first time in four years. The relationship is rekindled as the movie progresses. It is a true love match. There is a setback at one low point in the movie where McCoy,out of anger,becomes physical with his wife but they manage to get their act together again.Because of the deal to get McCoy out of prison, the two become part of a robbery which leads to the chase scene and much killing along the way. The action is totally escapist as they take possession of $3/4 million and avoid their pursuers and the police from one scene to another in rapid succession. Even though they are forced to kill almost everyone in their path, we root for them at every step of the way. Sally Struthers, of All in the Family TV fame, is pressed into action on the side of the villains. She plays her role to the hilt and is funny and ridiculous at the same time. Slim Pickens provides great comic touch near the end of the movie. Interestingly, the many gunshots that are peppered into numerous bodies do not show the blood and gore you would find in today's cinema. It is a thrilling chase and this movie did not disappoint.",

            "content": "This crime drama is centred on Carter \"Doc\" McCoy, a criminal who is in prison as the film opens. His parole application is rejected so he asks his wife to seek the help of a corrupt local politician. That gets him out but he is then asked to mastermind a bank robbery; his wife acts as his driver but the other two members of the team are to be people he doesn't know. Inevitably things don't go according to plan; first a guard is killed then it appears that another member of the crew, Rudy, intends to kill the others and take the money. Doc and Carol get away and meet the organiser but this too goes violently wrong... now they must get away from his family and associates; Rudy and the police.I really enjoyed this film; it might not be as action-packed as modern films in similar genre but it is all the better for that as it feels more real. The sense of reality is increased by the fact that the opening scenes are filmed in a real prison and what follows is filmed on location in Texas. Doc and Carol are unusual protagonists; they may be played by top names but they are not 'good people'...just better than most of the people they deal with. Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw are both great in these roles. The supporting cast are pretty impressive too; most notably Al Lettieri, who is menacing as Rudy. Director Sam Peckinpah films in a no-nonsense manner that adds to the feeling of reality; there is some of his trademark violence but it is less bloody that many of his films. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the genre.",

            "review_title": "Surprisingly lyrical crime caper.",
            "content": "Sam Pekinpah is generally considered a director of violent movies and it's easy to see why. Some of the action is in slow motion, which I've come to loathe, but the gimmick is judiciously used here and adds to the Gulp! quotient of the scenes.Steve McQueen has spent five years in prison, doomed to dream of his wife, Ali McGraw, while in submission to a life of rigorous discipline among a horde of hairy, angular strangers. This is all shown to us in one of the best credit sequences I've seen. (Editing by Robert Wolfe and the British Roger Spottiswoode, pronounced \"Spots-wood\", whom Pekinpah invariably addressed as \"Spottis-woodie.\")McQueen sends McGraw to visit Ben Johnson to make a deal. Johnson will see to it that McQueen is paroled if he agrees to lead a bank robbery. McQueen will be assisted by two hoods hired by Johnson. The Hood-in-Chief is Al Lettieri, a wolfish brute, evil to the core. McQueen doesn't trust the two hoods, and for good reason. After the robbery, Lettieri kills the other hood, then double crosses Steve McQueen and tries to shoot him. It is usually a big mistake to try to shoot Steve McQueen. McQueen wounds Lettieri, who later crawls into his car and drives to a veterinarian's for treatment. He kidnaps the vet and his shamelessly lustful wife, Sally Struthers, and they take off in pursuit of McQueen and McGraw.Meantime, the couple have gone to Ben Johnson's office to split the half million dollars. McQueen learns that the deal made by McGraw and Johnson involved more than just a robbery. McGraw had to sweeten the pot with her sinewy body. Perhaps out of guilt, she shoot Johnson.McQueen and McGraw take off for a seedy hotel on the outskirts of El Paso, with Lettieri hot on their trail. Johnson's criminal family also knows where the pair are headed and they take off after them too. And by this time, it has been revealed that McQueen was the guy who robbed the bank, so the police are looking for him too. I don't want to run out of space, so let's say our Romantic Couple are involved with one or two shoot outs with the cops and finally reach their destination in El Paso, where everybody runs into everybody else and a monstrous shoot out follows, involving automatic weapons, pistols, a big shotgun, a falling elevator, a pussy cat, and a terrified man hiding under a desk with a pamphlet sticking out of his back pocket -- \"Sex Over Fifty.\" The two lovers cross into Mexico with half a million dollars.The violence hardly comes as a big shocker. What DOES surprise a viewer is how long before we get to a violent scene. I can't imagine this movie being made today without opening with the bank robbery -- followed by a flashback to the prison. The film is positively languorous. There are several scenes between McQueen and McGraw that just linger, without any loss of interest. And there are other scenes that seem picked up out of everyday life, that are like short stories in themselves. McGraw sits at a bar in a railway station, waiting for McQueen to return. The plain-faced soldier sitting next to her clumsily tries to start a conversation. Not to pick her up, necessarily, but just because he's lonely and wants to talk to a good-looking woman. \"There aren't more than a handful of non-Mormons in Utah but I'm one of them,\" he offers. It's as if Candid Camera had captured the episode through a hidden lens. Even the smallest bit parts ring with authenticity -- a Mexican woman on a bench, the clerk in the TV repair place or the gun shop. Furthermore -- get this! -- the cathartic shoot out is NOT THE END OF THE MOVIE. There follow another ten or fifteen minutes of driving around with Slim Pickens in his dilapidated dump truck. No -- they wouldn't make it today.Clich\u00e9s are assiduously avoided. When McQueen gets out of prison, he and McGraw go to her apartment. He takes off his shirt. She sits on the bed and takes off her shirt. Maybe we expect the usual razzle-dazzle of passion, the ecstatic moans, the lap dissolves from the faces of the panting lovers to the anonymous fingertips caressing the unidentifiable fleshy fossa -- but no. It's been five years for McQueen and (except for that dalliance with Ben Johnson) for McGraw too, and McQueen simply sits there, holding her hand and unable to move. \"Don't worry, Doc,\" she tells him. \"I'm nervous too.\" They kiss. End of scene.McGraw doesn't have that many lines, which is just as well. Her appearance is suitable enough -- the generic beautiful woman -- but she sounds less like the wife of an armed robber in Texas than like a Wellesly graduate who became a model before morphing into an actress. She certainly is outfitted better than McQueen who, throughout, wears an ill-fitting black suit and a prison haircut that seems to have been done by some barber more intent on executing the hair than grooming it.Pekinpah is said to have been a misogynist but this film doesn't make it easy to see. After McQueen learns that McGraw slept with Johnson in order to get him sprung, he slaps her around until she sobs. Conduct unbecoming a gentleman, sure, but not unbecoming a career criminal. On top of that, any sensible viewer will see, as the script itself makes clear, that she did it for HIM. The problem is not hers but the obssessive McQueen's. She's by far the more honest and savvy of the two.Anyhow, see it. And if you disapprove of it, you'd better think again, because some day, sooner or later, Sam Pekinpah will meet you in heaven and break your spine in three different places.",

He and Sally Struthers were credible in their roles but I wonder why Doc let him live after knocking him out at the hotel. Also, a scene inside the hotel with Sally Struthers reaction to it would have been interesting. At the end of the day, this movie wasn't about the get away car or police chases or even the money. It was about the pump action shot gun and what a devastating weapon it is in a fight scene. Coming in second was the high caliber handgun used.

            "review_title": "A Peckinpah classic with substantial flaws",
            "content": "Of all things, Getaway is a very uneven effort by Sam Peckinpah that doesn't live up to its famous predecessors, The Wild Bunch (1969) and Straw Dogs (1971). With both, it shares the director's known liking for graphic violence (preferably using slow-motion gun shots) and queasy moral standards (that affect women and men alike), but too many flaws get in its way to make it a truly great thriller. The film opens with a very promising atmospheric prelude showing Doc McCoy (Steve McQueen) grappling with the hardship of prison life. When his request for parole is rejected by the Prison Board, he summons his wife Carol (Ali MacGraw) to barter an agreement with corrupt sheriff Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson) to get him released. The price to pay, or so it seems, is a bank robbery McCoy must carry out for Beynon's benefit. When McCoy learns that he will have to \"work\" with two of Beynon's men, his natural instinct tells him that he and his partner are in for trouble. Sure enough, things turn sour and McCoy is a man on the run. The main plot line is about deceit and suspicion. McCoy's near pathological mistrust in anyone crossing his way repeatedly saves his life but almost ruins it too, as it threatens to terminate his relationship with Carol as well. The film is served well by Peckinpah's utter lack of moralising impetus; the only things that make people tick in this movie are money and distrust (and, occasionally, sex; though that is more of an occupational gadget), and life is fundamentally a struggle against your next neighbour. Tellingly, redemption (a safe and proper life) lies beyond the border, in a fantasmagoric other territory, in this case Mexico, which in itself reeks of sarcasm. Though the main story has great moments in store, and the filming is spotless, the entire venture is at times obstructed by the overly caricatural subplot relating Rudy Butler's (Al Lettieri) chase of his one-day accomplice Doc. Aside from Quincy Jones' partly obnoxious soundtrack (and notwithstanding the eternal Toots Thieleman's harmonica spleen), another major defection in conjuring up the main protagonists' inner turmoil \u0096 the only \"ethical\" point, if you will \u0096 and give this film substance is MacGraw's sub-zero acting performance throughout. If she isn't a miscast, who is? And though McQueen turns in a standard no-kidding act, and most side acts certainly deserve a mention, nothing will do to bring life into the love plot. This in turn prevents the film from becoming a true 1970s Bonnie and Clyde journey, which would certainly have given it the edge it lacks. It is therefore no wonder that Getaway, unlike your classic crime romance, ends with a happy end \u0096 be it a rather cold one, fitting in with the overall sentiment that pervades the film. But since it's a Peckinpah after all, you won't regret spending your money on it.",

            "content": "Much better than the 1994 remake starring Baldwin and Basinger. As always, McQueen is fantastic here as thief \"Doc McCoy\" who's wife has just helped him out of prison. His screen presence is incredibly strong, and as usual he plays the the King of Cool to a tee. MacGraw, as his wife \"Carol\", turns in a solid performance (and looks ravishingly gorgeous as well), and the chemistry between her and McQueen is palpable (it's no surprise that they married after shooting this film), even though they barely touch each other (save for one or two kissing scenes). But there's noticeable angst and frustration between Doc and Carol; not only because he's been in jail for a few years, but also because Doc learns that Carol prostituted herself to get him out of jail. Ultimately, of course, this husband and wife team of thieves just can't live without each other. The action moves along at a good pace, and the car chases and shooting scenes are top notch - not fake like other action movies during the time. From the bank robbery to the various problems the couple face trying to escape to Mexico, the film is exciting and thrilling. It's also a bonus hoot to see McQueen and MacGraw (two of the biggest stars of the time) dumped at a garbage tip and covered in garbage. Very good action film.",

            "review_title": "Immensely enjoyable self-conscious chase thriller, which seemingly deviates from its director's usual fort\u00e9, but does in no way lag as a result.",
            "content": "With hindsight, it's interesting to note how people describe The Getaway as \"minor\" Peckinpah or through some sort of other word carrying with it a somewhat derogatory tinge; indeed, the makeup of the film, or its 'language', is indebted to a diverting away from an early aesthetic of rabid editing, a distorted use of sound over imagery plus a generality of the avant-garde, and into a more accessible, dare we we say more normalised, aesthetic of causality and other content generally not difficult to absorb. Such a shift in internal dynamic, quite literally within the body of the film, neatly echoes the overall switch from what people label Peckinpah's usual \"oeuvre\" and into something a little different, albeit more familiar, inclined to provide audiences with a piece adhering to generic convention or demand. Self reflexivity greets us upon dealing with The Getaway in this sense; a film with a reputation of being little more than a studio cash-in for Peckinpah and if such an item is true, then you might say is visually indicated in the above sense.The film follows two people, the lesser of several evils, and does a studious job in documenting their tribulations born out of the fallout of a money exchange which went wrong. Our peek into the life and times of these two leads, Steven McQueen's Carter McCoy and true to life as well as on-screen wife Carol, played by Ali MacGraw, echoes that of a female supporting act and her exposure to this existence of crime and chase when she and her husband are forced into tagging along across the depths of Texas. One might very well classify Peckinpah's film, indeed overall politic in regards to what plays out in The Getaway, as amoral - but his subplot of a hapless woman beginning life as a decent person (a veterinarian helping save lives very much earning money morally, no less) before coming around to be rather attuned to a sadistic gangster and his ways, acts as a devilish aside alluding to our own relationship-come-desire to 'will on' McQueen and MacGraw through this fallout of banditry and spilt blood. Mirroring the audience in regards to the two leads, this said supporting female, named Fran (Struthers), first observes her icons of gangsterdom and crime when they are in a state of near complete undress - a glimpsing of them at their barest and most vulnerable having just been put through a mill of hardship and strife on account of the sharp-mindedness of others in their field.The Getaway begins with a montage of rural wildlife; deer grazing, glancing up at the camera and then freezing as they look at us whilst the opening titles pause \u2013 as if eerily in headlights. Then, we hear the unmistakable bark of a dog \u2013 the idea of perhaps this, a hunting trip unfolding, dawning on us. No, it is a simple field beside a large prison and degrees of cold blooded hunting will transpire later. Carter is in prison; his credentials impressive, the outlining of who he is at a parole hearing reiterating precisely where his skills lie. The consequent rejection of parole places him in an unenviable position of having to work for a corrupt insider named Benyon (Johnson) or face an ongoing Hell of surplus routine and sexual frustration out of being away from his wife. It is precisely her sexuality that gets him out of prison, something which unfolds when she meets with Benyon to sort out his release \u2013 her sporting of a dress designed to accentuate certain parts of her body whilst a jukebox plays music firmly instilling the scene with that of romance; her being leered at by Benyon's goons in the reception area an initial establishment of her scopophilic qualities.Where McCoy hears from Benyon on the job at hand is on a small barge floating down river as he lays everything out, its drifting beneath a bridge now and again briefly plunging proceedings into a shrouded, gloomy sort and away from the bright Texan light thus highlighting Benyon's corrupt, depraved, darkened characteristics which periodically rear up away from the surface 'light' as a prison official. He organises McCoy and two others, Rudi (Lettieri) and Frank (Hopkins), to rob a local bank for him; Rudy of whom recently worked with an old acquaintance of McCoy's who in his estimation was a good man at what he did, but who was killed only recently whilst operating with Rudy alluding to characteristics of the man that'll later become more apparent. McCoy's duelling with Rudi begins with an argument on real-life gangster John Dillenger, the third male member of their troup\u00e9 falling away from the generality of hard-edged and hard-bodied proceedings when McCoy catches him out and berates him as if a school-child for not paying enough attention during an important meeting over how the robbery will be executed.Peckinpah's film doesn't so much glamorise crime as much detail a chapter in the lives of numerous bodies more broadly linked to it; all of this, before offering a quintessential resolution within which the outcome is only as nihilistic as it is when lined up against other realistic outcomes. Is the spectator pleased with the conclusion to the similarly structured 2008 film No Country for Old Men because a set-behavioural pattern is quintessentially demonised? Or ought the labelling of it as a 'happy' ending fall to deaf ears when we realise only one of a handful of evil parties were ever going to make it out of such a scenario with the prize anyway \u2013 most of them scummier than certain others, but each of them essentially scummy in their own right. Regardless, The Getaway is a taut and exciting self-reflective thriller; a pleasant excursion from \"normal\" Peckinpah - a dogged film about two dogged characters sticking out a series of grimy misadventures in what is ultimately a grotty, unglamourous portrait of chase and law-evading on top of an exciting film-watching experience.",

            "content": "This is Sam Peckinpah completely selling out to Steve McQueen in order to find some kind of financial success, and it works. It's not deep. It's not moving. It is pretty consistently entertaining, though. This is a Steve McQueen vehicle first and foremost, and Peckinpah brings the professional quality to the action and direction something like this needs.Doc McCoy (McQueen) gets rejected for parole in prison, so he tells his wife Carol (Ali MacGraw) to go to Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson) and tell him that he'll do whatever Beynon wants if he gets Doc out. Carol, an attractive young woman, desperate to get her husband out of prison, does as she is bid, and Beynon pulls some strings to convince the parole board to change its mind. Beynon wants McCoy to lead a heist of a small Texas bank and get $500,000 from its vault. He imposes a team on McCoy of two men, Rudy (Al Lettieri) and Jackson (Bo Hopkins).In a quick sequence that a post-Ocean's Eleven world feels far too short (it's not a problem in the film, Peckinpah and the script by Walter Hill are just more concerned with the aftermath than the heist itself), McCoy makes his plans, and it's obvious that this team is not going to work. Rudy is too contrarian to McCoy's hard work, and Jackson is simply too dismissive of everything to prepare properly. However, McCoy doesn't really have a choice.The heist goes wrong (of course), Rudy kills Jackson and tries to kill McCoy. McCoy wounds him (not checking the supposedly dead man's vitals because the movie needs to happen), and he's off with Carol to try and patch up the whole thing. There's a meeting with Beynon where a hidden truth about the heist is revealed, and Carol's complicity in manipulating McCoy comes out.Now, I'm convinced that this is supposed to be the heart of the film. The film's final scenes make that really obvious. The most common motif in Peckinpah's body of work is men outside their own time, and that manifests here in the form of McCoy being in prison for four years only to emerge to a new world, in particular around his wife. They don't really seem to know each other anymore, and what Carol was willing to do just to get him out of prison, up to conspiring against him, shows the distance. However, it's all very, very thin, helped in no small part by the relative lack of interest MacGraw brings to the part of Carol. Instead of looking desperately relieved when he comes back to her at some point, it's like they've been apart for five minutes. She lacks conviction, and I wonder if it's because McQueen protected her from Peckinpah's directing style which has often been described as harsh and manipulative. Most of the film is really occupied with the progression of events as the noose around the McCoys gets tighter.That noose is really a three-way pincer movement between Rudy who takes a veterinarian (Jack Dodson) and his wife Fran (Sally Struthers) hostage, cuckolding the vet along the way towards the border crossing he knows McCoy will take (with everyone on his tail, why doesn't McCoy choose another border crossing into Mexico? I dunno), the police, and Beynon's brother (John Bryson). There's a little sidequest when Carol accidentally loses the big suitcase full of cash to a random smalltime thief that leads to a tense little chase through a train that puts the police on McCoy's tail.As their options become more limited, as more people begin to recognize them from news reports the closer they get to El Paso, their actions become more desperate to the point that they end up in a garbage truck that throws them into a dump outside of town. The straining of their relationship comes to a head here, and more focus on the relationship and a better pair of performances (McQueen is himself and little more) could have made this really affecting. It's not, thought. It's pretty functional, at least.There's a final showdown at a hotel that feels like Peckinpah simply giving people what they want since it's very reminiscent of the big ending of The Wild Bunch, and Slim Pickens shows up in a small role at the end to get them a bit further on their journey. He has some dialogue that makes it extremely obvious that the point of the film is supposed to be this reconciliation and reconnection between husband and wife, but so much of the film is dedicated to the action of the eponymous getaway that it doesn't connect as well as it probably should.Rudy is an interesting character, because he seems like the kind of character that Peckinpah would normally have as a main character. Working under McQueen's thumb, Peckinpah seemed to have little say in how either of the McCoys were presented, but with Rudy, he's purely Peckinpah. He gets involved with a short, buxom, blonde woman who is a shade removed from being a prostitute. He's mean and cruel, especially to the poor veterinarian who eventually decides he can't take anymore of the degradation. I'm actually surprised that he's not played by Warren Oates. In what feels like an overall safe, star vehicle for Peckinpah to rehabilitate his reputation to some degree, it's in the character of Rudy that Peckinpah seems to have poured himself.The Getaway is Peckinpah's least personal film since The Deadly Companions, but he proves himself a capable director for hire nonetheless. He did start work in television. He manages the action well in addition to the tension. He couldn't help Ali MacGraw's somewhat limited performance and the script really needed another pass to focus more on the characters, but the end result is a good, tense chase through the Texas countryside.",

My favorite scene was the thwarted double-cross between McCoy and Butler. All the shooting, the close-calls, and of course the successful getaway from the law was well planned.

I am a sucker for 1970s movies because I love the imagery of that decade and this film does not disappoint.The plot is nothing new; McQueen gets out of jail and needs to another Bank heist as payment for his freedom. As you might expect not all goes to plan. Soon our heroes are cris-crossing Texas, trying to avoid several corrupt Texans, the police and a psychotic criminal.The casting, naturally, is spot on. A great pack of villains, attractive and racy leads, and several realistic side characters that compliment McQueen and McCraw perfectly.This is my first Peckinpah venture. He really was a directorial talent who fit the zeitgeist of the 60s and 70s very well with his penchant for sexual interplay and violence. His grasp of colour and capturing the right image is amongst the best of any era. The pacing of the film is varied, but always keeps us surprised with numerous twists and turns along the way.Its an essential gangster film. It doesn't try to be anything more, but its great entertainment and it retains a gritty realism that rises it above its competitors.10/10",

The Getaway was a critical and commercial success, receiving both good reviews from the press and earning profitable revenue at the box office. The screenplay was written by Walter Hill and he would go on to be one of my favorite filmmakers of the next generation. However, this is a Sam Peckinpah film and he is on his A game here in his direction on this project. The film is more straightforward than most of Sam's other work, but it is very much made in a similar fashion with great character development, nail biting tension and his signature slow motion blood splattered gunplay. There are a lot of similarities between this heist flick and Bonnie And Clyde with real romantic chemistry between Steven McQueen and Ali MacGraw , who work well together here with a cast of Peckinpaw regulars. Steve McQueen is outstanding here as antihero and leading man in this film. With his unique presence and style he carries the film seemingly with ease with a natural coolness and demeanor where here does so without saying much, but with conveying a lot of intensity through his facial expressions. He also was a very physical actor, in good shape and great with firearms. His performance here is one of his best and the film moves along pretty quickly with some really intense car chases and state of the art shootouts. I can see how this film influenced John Woo in the action films he would make later on. Make no mistake, The Getaway is a classic, great film.",

While I found that one a bit too over the top in terms of action scenes , here Peckintah succeeds in giving us a stellar performance without the need of a high body count.The movie stars Steve Mcqueen as Carter \"Doc\" McCoy . Recently released from prison thanks to his wife Carol McCoy played by Ali MacGraw and hired to rob a bank . Needless to say something goes wrong and Doc finds himself in a series of double crossings causing him to be chased by the police and his former employers.\"The Getaway\" perfectly blends the action and thriller genre, creating a very intense always on the edge and never knowing what to expect next atmosphere. The chemistry between Mcqueen and MacGraw works, with both characters sympathetic and memorable in their own way. Mcqueen delivers one of his best performances with his down to earth charismatic look, he doesn't need to say anything, the viewer can understand him just by the way he reacts or looks during a certain situation. That strong presence makes the movie all the more enjoyable as the audience is able to believe that McQueen is a professional thief. Director Sam Peckintah's use of slow-motion and destructible environments unlike most modern movies isn't over used keeping the movie's tone to a much more realistic and also enjoyable level. Also noticeable is the presence of a sub-plot involving one of the main antagonists, giving us a greater and much more in-depth knowledge of the people trying to kill McCoy.With at an all out great performance by it's cast and crew \"The Getaway\" is sure to deliver a memorable two hour watch to any fan of the genre.",

            "content": "The Getaway is one of the greatest looking thrillers ever.It is very well paced,and its fast pace makes it suspenseful and interesting.It is extremely compact\u0097and McQueen also is very compact.And it does not insult the intelligence, although the plot simply does not exist, it is reduced to a minimum of things.An interesting no-nonsense movie with plenty of straightforward action is not this good by chance;it is so good because someone knew how to make it. Peckinpah was this man,and McQueen was again the right lead.Although I have seen this movie before,and several times its Basinger remake,when I saw it this time it was a moment when,not remembering the end,I was wondering whether they will finally make it or not. So I guess the story is somehow unpredictable,though minimal as concerns the originality.Then there is this stench of imbecility and illiterate base brutes and this odor of violent churlishness,of uncouthness, undomesticated by the fancy nuances that some noir movies used\u0097all the SP movies that I know have it\u0097this ungenerous conception\u0097but then it rightly belongs to the world shown\u0097one of the most unattractive film worlds \u0085--this unclean world of blunt negations \u0085.The filthiness, the sleazy dingy vulgar life this characters have is certainly more shocking than the violence denounced by the philistines. You see,\"Doc\" is undaunted and undismayed\u0097but he is not legendary,he is not larger-than-life.His life is part of this prosaic fresco of ugliness.This is the most violent thing in SP's movies\u0097the ugliness of the lives,the emptiness,the void\u0097completely assumed and fairly represented.In \"Getaway\",there is the band of boors and cads that hunt Doc.The plot could not have been more rudimentary. In a few words, Peckinpah was a competent director of thrillers,westerns (and the related sub-genres\u0097e.g., The Ballad of Cable Hogue and Junior Bonner ) and WW2 movies.He did not know how to make another kinds of film,and when he nonetheless tried,he should not have.But 13 out of 14 times he made the right choice of the genre. Convoy was a wrathful pointless working class epic that did not belong to Peckinpah's genres.SP's main quality,for me,is that he was sharply criticized by philistines and by respectable inept critics.Moreover,his movies are brutal,indeed,but not in the way the philistines claim that they are. Peckinpah's naturalism is not in his action scenes that have scandalized the imbeciles.McQueen was a handsome and cool middle class, ordinary guy,but not an Adonis;and Peckinpah needed this kind of workman identities for his films.More of SP's movies,than those that he did with, are for McQueen;e.g., Convoy would surely have been better with McQueen as a truckers' messiah,instead of the uninteresting guy he used there. The Ballad of Cable Hogue would not of been better with McQueen,I agree,because an ugly churl,as the one in the movie,was needed for that role.Yet I would of liked \"Hogue\" with McQueen even better.",

I had seen his other films, most notably \"Bullitt\" (1968) when I was 14 years old. The back story on this film is incredible. Steve McQueen, one of the most iconic actors of the the entire 20th Century, wanted Ali MacGraw, fresh off a tremendous hit in \"Love Story\", to be cast in this Sam Peckinpaw film. MacGraw later said it was like being on an advanced film set. Peckinpaw told her, \"If you want to know everything about acting, just watch Steve's eyes.\" At the time, she was married to Robert Evans; the head of Paramount Studios, and probably the most powerful man in Hollywood. It didn't make any difference. This was Steve McQueen; he had that kind of power. It was a foregone conclusion something would happen, and it did. They fell in love. She divorced Evans and married McQueen within a year. The headlines got the film even more attention before it's release. She fell in love with the most iconic, sexiest man in Hollywood, and McQueen fell in love with the girl from \"Love Story\". Some of what I wrote here comes from a very good documentary any McQueen fan should see: \"I Am Steve McQueen\" (2014). Of course, I grew up on his films (and TV when I was really young: \"Wanted Dead or Alive\"). The supporting cast is great as well: Slim Pickens is terrific, plus Ben Johnson, Al Lettieri and Sally Struthers. McQueen was a huge fan of Humphrey Bogart. Both McQueen and Peckinpah said this was an ode to Bogart in \"High Sierra\" (1941). He and Ali McGraw are even better in this. It is a true classic. In the documentary film \"I Am Steve McQueen\" (2014), released 34 years after his death, Ali said Steve was one of the few actors she would watch in any film, simply because of his presence. BTW, MacGraw said in the same documentary when she arrived at the airport, McQueen and Peckinpah picked her up. On the drive back to her hotel, Steve was doing 360\u00b0 spins on the freeway! It was quite a shock to herself which she described as \"Take that, you Connecticut non-actress\" (her words; not theirs). She knew immediately \"this is going to be an incredible experience, partially because McQueen was the biggest star in the world; which was enormously intimidating in itself.\" She was right.",

            "content": "There is such a raw power to Sam Peckinpah's work that even his ugliest blood baths (The Wild Bunch, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid) are watchable at least once. Then there's his most commercially palatable and mainstream-pleasing The Getaway, a gutty and masculine heist drama with Steve McQueen, Ali McGraw, and Al Lettieri.I love this movie for three reasons. The first is that Peckinpah's stylish tricks and gimmicks don't get in the way of the raw, visceral power of McQueen, but accentuate it. He's found a great balance between visually exciting camera shots and editing and his characters' humanity. When McQueen is confronted by the police and realizes he that he can't run, that he has to use violence to intimidate the cops into backing off, Peckinpah fires up his editing magic by having Doc McCoy unleash a frightening display of controlled rage using a shotgun, a cop car, and a lot of back-and-forth flash cuts and slow motion. The movie slides, bashes through, and lurches forward at the right times, not in spite of itself.Secondly, his central characters, Doc and Carol McCoy (McQueen and Ali McGraw) and their antagonist, Rudy (Lettieri) are fun to watch. McQueen's charisma is undeniable and his brief spurts of savagery toward his adversaries--and McGraw--make him a believable ex-con with an above-average IQ and self-discipline. McGraw is much better than most critics think because her awkward, bitchy Carol really is emotionally stranded in a wasteland where the man bankrolling the heist (Ben Johnson) extorts sex from her and her husband not only doesn't trust her, but blames her for being unfaithful to him.What's a girl to do? McGraw pulls off Carol McCoy not because of a limited acting ability, but because her icy, model looks fit the character with a painful precision. She's a bitch, but she wants her husband back, both physically and emotionally, so badly so that she's willing to be raped for him.In his short career as a bad guy in American films, the late, great Al Lettieri left his mark as a truly hideous gargoyle of a villain. Lettieri could be suave and soft-spoken in The Godfather, smoothly dangerous in McQ, and a sickening and repulsive sociopath here in The Getaway. He's so comfortable as the murderous Rudy that, while you may be struggling with Ali McGraw, you know exactly where you stand and what you get with Rudy. As he coldly guns down Bo Hopkins, turns violent with barbecued ribs, and lets Sally Struthers stroke the barrel of his Colt Python, Lettieri counterpoints McQueen by showing the criminal we expect, a deadly predator who cannot defer gratification. In many ways, it's Lettieri's film.The third and last reason I so enjoyed The Getaway is that its power is so great that even the edited version, shown thirty years ago on CBS and much later on American Movie Classics, is astonishingly violent, but more than that, intense. The work CBS did on The Getaway for its network premiere in 1976 still stands as one of the better editing jobs I think I've ever seen. I always like to see movies uncut and uninterrupted, but if the movie is on TV and I've got nothing better to do, I'll watch it.My only complaint with The Getaway is really with the MPAA. How can anyone have seen this as a PG movie? The language is not that harsh, but the intensity of emotion (see if you can sit still as McQueen pummels McGraw with slaps and backhands) and the sick relationship between Lettieri and his captive/lover Struthers should have earned an R.Oh, well. It's 35 years of water under the bridge. I strongly recommend The Getaway for its artistry and characterizations, not to mention the quality of the chase across Texas, leaving bodies and cars bleeding, smoking ruins.Watch McQueen's eyes as he tries to train Lettieri and Hopkins in the fine art of bank robbery and you'll know your time is being used well.",

Steve McQueen was known as one of the first \"cool\" movie stars, and rightly so. Sam Peckinpah was known for directing movies that were violent, stylish, and fast-paced. With \"The Getaway\" he scored one out of three. What little violence there is isn't even entertaining, since it's not \"action,\" per se, but rather criminals murdering other criminals.For a story about bank robbers on the run from the police and other criminals, \"The Getaway\" is surprisingly lifeless and anemic. The plot has no drive or momentum. There are a couple of head-scratching segments that seem completely out of place, as if the screenwriter ran out of ideas and had to stop and think for fifteen minutes before writing the next scene. On top of all that, Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw both play unsympathetic characters, and the numerous scenes with Al Lettieri and the woman who becomes his hostage/lover just hurt your eyes.\"The Getaway\" has no redeeming qualities: it's boring, it's unpleasant, it's sleazy, it's too long, and the plot makes little sense. In fact, if this movie had been made with an unknown director and unknown cast, it's unlikely that it would be known today at all. That's how bad \"The Getaway\" is.",

Unfortunately the result was an abomination.The film was hijacked by McQueen who controlled the final cut and watered down a screenplay already watered down from the book.  The film was disavowed by both Thompson and Peckinpah and various other involved in its making.  The director upon seeing the final cut peed on the screen and shouted, \"This is not my film!\" Thompson could have (and did) complained, \"This is not my story!\"One of the great noir classics with a highly original and ironic ending was transformed into an all too typical Hollywood product with an all too typical ending.  A book who's tone was dark and dismal was transformed into a cutesy love story/chase film. The end of the movie had nothing to do with the end in the book which is largely the point of the whole story (I'd like to go onhere but can't without violating the no spoiler rule)Steve McQueen who mucked things up off camera even disappoints on camera. He puts on a weak performance as does Ali MacGraw (perhaps they were distracted by there spudding love affair)Other than that Sally Struthers (who I usually don't like) put on an excellent performance the best thing I can say about this flick is that it was not as bad as the remake!Don't waste your time and money on this, read the book. If your really in the mood for a movie see something by Quentin Tarantino or the Coen Brothers or something else by Peckinpah (especially The Wild Bunch) or (if you want to see a movie adaptation of a Thompson book) The Grifters.",

Sheriff Beynon (Ben Johnson) got him out in exchange for Doc to do a bank job worth at least $500k. Beynon assigns him Rudy Butler (Al Lettieri) and Frank Jackson as his crew. The bank job goes wrong. Frank kills a guard. Rudy shoots Frank. Rudy tries to shoot Doc but Doc beats him to the draw. Rudy wearing a bullet-proof vest survives. Benyon also tries to doublecross Doc with Carol's help but Carol shoots Benyon instead. Carol slept with Benyon trying to get Doc out of prison. Meanwhile Rudy kidnaps a couple (Jack Dodson, Sally Struthers).Director Sam Peckinpah gets to do a lot of action with a simple thin plot. The characters aren't that deep. The couple has a good turn in the story. The tension is surprisingly not that high. It's an action road film that needs more excitement. While the action is good, the movie is very slow a lot of the times. It really only has Peckinpah's action going for it and he's using too much slow motion action. While Rudy's story is a bit different, I'm not really invested in him or his captives. Also I would have made Doc a harder man. Carol is right. He's not hard enough. However the movie has got good Peckinpah action but not much else.",

There are some good moments in the picture that make it a good film.  One, the opening credits with some terrific montage.  Two, the botched bank robbery.  Three, the garbage truck sequence.  Four, the gun fight in slow motion near the end.\nBased on a novel by pulp fiction arthor Jim Thompson, The Getaway(1972) lacks any of the interesting parts of his novel.  Not as good as other films based on Jim Thompson's work like The Grifters(1991).  In the manner of They Live by Night, You Only Live Once, Gun Crazy, and Bonnie & Clyde.  The acting varies from actor to actor.  Sam Peckinpah did the best he could with an average script.  I have a feeling that if Peckinpah wrote some of the screenplay then the movie might have been beter than it turned out to be. The director's next film would be the magificent if slightly flawed Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid(1973).\nThe story is adequetely written by Walter Hill.  He would reuse portions of the gun battle scene at the hotel during the first few moments of 48 Hours(1982).  In fact the scene where Doc Mccoy tells his wife to stall the person that's outside his door is too similar to the one in 48 Hours(1982). The chemistry of Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw is average and inconsistent. Al Lettieri is the best actor in the film with his sadistic and slimy performance as the double crossing Rudy Butler.  He almosts carrys the entire film on his back with his impressive performance.\nBen Johnson is very good in the role of Jack Beynon.  The cinematography of Lucien Ballard is one of the film's few bright spots. Ali MacGraw is just below average and not good at all in giving a convincing performance.  The action scenes with the slow mo shoot ouys are the few things that are pure Peckinpah.  The director did not have final cut because the main actor decided to have the film edit himself thus making the film good if not average.  The Getaway(1972) is a film that's in need of the director'c cut treatment which restores the film to the original vision of Sam Peckinpah.",

Just look at him in scene after scene doing things that only he could, uhh, excuse the expression, get away with. There have been few, very very few actors with his physical presence: only Burt Lancaster and Jimmy Cagney come immediately to mind, one a supreme dancer the other a circus performer. And of course, McQueen the car and motorcycle rider. That is to say, all of them athletes. Yet even the great dancers, Astaire, Kelly, did not have the fluid movements of McQueen. In this he turns shooting, killing, into pure ballet. Then add those glasses, his little giggle during one of the car escapes, the sharp, knifelike jabs at the neck of the thief on the train and the same kind of jabs at McGraw when he is whacking her around, and none of it overdone, or forced looking.The rest of the movie is pretty standard. The Lettieri stuff, the whole chase, stupid. Much better without poor Harold and Maude, uhh, lamebrain, whatever her name. Sometimes Sam had himself a little too much fun on our behalf. And the Quincy Jones music is actually irritating. But it doesn't matter. Even the scene where McQueen is eating a sandwich with his coke is unique in cinema, with the possible exception of Lancaster muggingingly wolfing down the chow in Vera Cruz with his shiny choppers. Here McQueen, and Jimmy Cagney in White Heat do the kind of stuff that all the money in the world can't buy: you just have to get lucky enough to have brought them along for the ride.And to think that in not much more than six years after the film, McQueen would find all that fine \u00e9lan gone on an operating table in Mexico. Thanks, Steve. You and Sam did something fabulous here. Not to forget how well they worked in Junior Bonner, a much better film than this, but there McQueen is limping and toned down some and is acting with some pretty great talent: in this one it's just he absolutely owning the screen.",

When things go wrong at the robbery, including the death of one of Doc's men (Bo Hopkins) and when another crew member (Al Lettieri) turns on the McCoys, it forces the couple on the run.Peckinpah's nearly flawless eye for cinematic violence is one of the things that makes this film so completely watchable. Watch the scene where McQueen levels a police car with a shot gun...Peckinpah once again makes the art of cinematic violence look almost musical...like a slow- motion ballet. Very few directors have accomplished as much over the years with the art of slow motion as Sam Peckinpah. Mention should also be made of a hair-raising scene that takes place on a garbage truck that the McCoys are forced to hide in.Despite MacGraw's limited acting skills, there is no denying the white hot chemistry she had with the late McQueen. Ben Johnson is appropriately slimy as the warden and Al Lettieri is bone-chilling and works well with Sally Struthers, who plays the innocent housewife who becomes his hostage.The film was remade in 1994 with Alex Baldwin and Kim Basinger, but as I usually say in reviews like this one, stick with the original. An instant classic that has great re-watch appeal, even almost fifty years after its original release.",

McQueen was not the most eloquent actor but that is of no importance here - he asks MacGraw for \"whiskey, whiskey, whiskey...\" Films try hard to be cool but this does it - from the taut opening sequence of McQueen doing bird to his lady's choice of victims.

Pretty tame by today's standards , but still packs a punch. I also like 70's films and this has that old 70's charm that we never see anymore. I also thought the minimal use of dialog between McQueen and MacGraw was correct, because it allowed the intensity of the relationship to build in that subtle and non-verbal way with good uses of dramatic pauses. People often berated MacGraw for her weak acting, and it's true she was never a great actress. But here, Peckinpah utilizes her wooden performance to its advantage and somehow makes it look believable. A great director can turn any performance from a woman into something good. Favorite scenes were when Rudy gets shot and is wearing a bullet proof vest. Also, when McQueen purchases a 12-Gauge shot gun over the counter, is a classic scene for gun aficionados. Sally Struthers getting slapped and the chase scenes. This is good entertainment, regardless of what ever became of McQueen or MacGraw in real life.",

Both are broody people of few words, yet are intelligent and controlled, and ruthless.  Also MacGraw is absolutely gorgeous in this. Don't watch wannabe Tarantino imitations, and don't listen to people who say rip offs like True Romance are better, The Getaway was there first and is superior in every way.

            "content": "Jim Thompson, author of the novel \"?The Getaway,\" was one of the weirdest writers of his day (late-'40s,'50s). He wrote basic crime novels - or apparently he did; the first half of every novel reads like the first half of every pulp crime novel being written in that era. I suppose this was to get the publishers to buy the project. But in the 2nd half of his novels - well....Let's take the Getaway. (Now it's been a while since I read it, but this is how I remember it:) First: half: unhappily married gangster couple rob a bank, screw around with other members of the gang, shoot it out, lose them, escape to Mexico. Second half; Escaped gangster couple winds up in a resort hotel for escaping criminals. They are charged exorbitant bucks. They cheat on each other. They try to keep themselves amused (not much to do in that hotel). They watch as other residents of the hotel seem to disappear. They discover that the cost of the hotel has drained their ill-gotten gains completely, yet they are still getting charged a bill. How will they ever pay? -simple: at this hotel, once you go broke - they eat you.I don't know how any film like that could have been made. So I suppose it shouldn't surprise me that the film of the Getaway should stop in mid-novel.Still, I really feel that a good beat got skipped. And it feels like that throughout the whole movie. Even though I find the Peckinpah version fascinating, the remake is probably a better film from the same script, because it isn't burdened with the sense of unfinished business that permeates Peckinpah's film. I think it has to do with the Thompson novel; the remake, which is a new version of the original screenplay, doesn't owe any responsibility to Thompson's novel; but Peckinpah's version does, and can't quite figure out what that responsibility might be.So I will reveal what that responsibility is, even accepting that only half the novel is used: The married couple do not really love each other, they are only in it for the money; consequently, her decision to sleep with the gang boss to get her husband out of prison is not a self-sacrifice, it's a business tactic. This marriage is utterly doomed from the get-go, for the simple reason that both participants are greedy criminal socio-paths - which appears to have been Jim Thompson's basic take on the institution of marriage in its entirety. No wonder no one's made a movie out of Thompson's novel; perhaps they shouldn't have even tried.I think Peckinpah understands this to a certain extent, and probably had a similarly jaundiced view on male-female relationships, as Straw Dogs certainly indicates. But though he was courageous enough to take on the project, he couldn't bring himself to finish it (and McQueen probably wouldn't have let him). Oh, well, the film is as it is, an entertaining crime thriller. (Still, what might have been....)Ewnnrj",

Not long after getting out though, Doc needs to do a small favour for mob boss Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson), robbing another bank. So he and co-robber Rudy Butler (Al Lettieri) do the job, but it is obvious they will not get away with when it backfires. So begins a long chase with Doc and Carol pursued by some police, crazed Rudy, and the heavily armed henchmen of Beynon. After all the guns firing, hiding and going from vehicle to vehicle, Doc and Carol do get away in the end with the large amount of cash in the suitcase, I guess that is a happy ending. Also starring Sally Struthers as Fran Clinton, Slim Pickens as Cowboy, Richard Bright as The Thief, Jack Dodson as Harold Clinton, Dub Taylor as Laughlin, Bo Hopkins as Frank Jackson, Roy Jenson as Cully and John Bryson as The Accountant. McQueen is charismatic, I suppose MacGraw has her moments, they do both make a good duo, and they did fall in love and marry in real life.

The lean, mean environment and amoral characters are well matched, in truth you'd do well to avoid both. That includes our two \"heroes\" who, while they are given a touch more humanity at appropriate moments are also ready to kill at the drop of a stetson.Peckinpahs regular lensman veteran Lucien Ballard gives The Getaway a feel that is both vivid and washed-out as his cameras survey the flat grey Texan vistas, stucco walls and (often) splintered wood paneling. The trademark cross-cut/slow-mo editing still pleases in concert with Quincy Jones fragmented score which, like that for Dollars (1971) makes interesting use of voices as instrument sounds.I have not seen the remake but I can only imagine that any comparison would only make this version look all the better, Alec Baldwin v Steve McQueen?

To this day, THE GETAWAY has aged gracefully and still packs a wallop and with some dynamic characters thrown in for good measure. General good guy Ben Johnson is a surprise(!) and very convincing as \"the man with a plan\" who has no plan for McQueen, ready to leave him high and dry. Likewise, dependable heavy Al Lettieri (from THE GODFATHER) yet another one of McQueen's worst nightmares. This crime thriller zigzags into high gear and talk about reversal of fortunes! Best scene, at least the most imaginative, may be McQueen and MacGraw's being dumped at the city dump! One well mounted chase film that could serve as a blueprint for future directors, and at the very least, should be required viewing thanks to Peckinpah's craftsmanship. Interesting bit parts by tv stars Sally Struthers and Jack Dodson as a terrorized young married couple, and they are (blanking) bricks! Remade in 1994 with Alec Baldwin in the McQueen role, and not that bad, but nobody could duplicate McCool. Nobody. Time to get the dvd.",

            "content": "This film pales in comparison with director Sam Peckinpah's other work from this period.  While \"The Wild Bunch,\" \"Straw Dogs\" and, to a degree, \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\" are completely captivating works, blending top-notch acting, direction, and storytelling,\"The Getaway\" is a feeble sibling with only bits of Peckinpah's usual brilliance.The plot, which centers around the (mis)adventures a husband and wife heist team on the lam, is likely deftly served by cult crime writer Jim Thompson, it only chugs along clumsily for the first hour on celluloid.  There are occasional interesting touches and a good supporting cast, but little in the way of real inspiration.  Surprisingly, there are extended sequences when the film distinctly mirrors the faceless cop dramas that were playing on television at the time the film was released.Much of the blame can be put on the self-styled \"Bogey and Bacall\" of the 70s, stars MacGraw and McQueen.  While the two attractive leads  lend the film an air of a modern day \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" and were box-office draws, they nearly sink the film entirely.  It has been written that McQueen decided to edit this film on his own (!), but as he was one of the better actors of the decade, his ill-advised hubris is unmatched by the near worthlessness of MacGraw's performance.MacGraw can't even seem to draw upon her life romance with her co-star to kindle any on screen chemistry, and McQueen seems stiff and uncomfortable in his romantic scenes with his wife.  Yet as one somewhat anonymous chase leads to another, the subplot involving a thug, Sally Struthers's dimwitted blonde  and her pathetic veterinarian husband takes continually stranger turns, things heat up amidst a hail of bullets, garbage, and sheer momentum.  (Peckinpah could obviously handle these types of chores with his eyes closed.)  Despite its many faults, \"The Getaway\" manages to come to a fairly satisfying conclusion.Worth a look on cable, and certainly interesting to fans of the stars (if there any MacGraw fans out there) and the director.",

There are also a couple of slow-mo shootout scenes which really capture the moment and add a great deal to the film. The script is sharp and the acting on song. McQueen plays the part with his usual subtlety and cool, whilst MacGraw doesn't follow the route of so many leading ladies in being very annoying, but is actually a character you like. The start is a tad slow, but the rest of the film is nicely paced and whilst a little dated nowadays its still one of the best crime movies available. One to buy in my opinion.",

            "content": "The Getaway (1972) more than fulfills the expectations we bring to a Sam Peckinpah film, being tough, suspenseful, gritty, and unsentimental, with a nod to Peckinpah's personal mythology of Mexico as the mythic country where the rules are different -- the protagonists don't actually get there, but it is the destination of their whole violent odyssey. Steve McQueen, at his iciest, and Ali MacGraw are a Bonnie-and-Clyde style bank robbing couple who pull a big heist which, of course, goes horribly wrong: in the aftermath they have to dodge both their double- and -triple-crossing partners and the police to escape the country with their loot. The film has a number of stunning sequences -- the scenes where the couple hide in a dumpster and end up being slid into landfill is a classic -- and suspense is kept up throughout. The film's main defect is Ali MacGraw's lackluster performance -- she's at her most effective when she just stands there and lets the photography present her as a warm-blooded sexual foil to McQueen's cold-bloodedness. (Incidentally, McQueen and MacGraw were married after meeting doing this film.) A more memorable performance is given by Sally Struthers as a 180-degree opposite of the wholesome girl next door that is her usual public image.Advisory: if you know Peckinpah films, you know this will be replete with sex and, especially, violence.I saw this the 2005 Warner Home Video standard DVD; which was of good quality. There is now also a Blu-Ray, which I suppose would be better.",

Best moment comes at the beginning of the movie...McQueen is let out of jail and his wife is late picking him up. She says something like \"where do you want to go\" and he responds, \"anywhere, just out\". You can feel the jail time McQueen has been through, and the bond he and his wife share. Also, McGraw's clothes are fabulous throughout and she is beautiful to watch. I didn't mind her acting at all in this. I was simply riveted by the two of them.

My advice to the reader is, if you do not have this DVD movie in your collection of action movies, and you see it in a store, buy it regardless of the price. If it's a rental you will definitely not want to take it back. I have most of Peckinpah's films and this is my #2 favourite after The Wild Bunch. McQueen is the thinking man he was in Bullitt, and ex model Ali McGraw looks beautiful even when she is hurled out of the back of a garbage truck, the romance and chemistry between the pair is very sensitive and believable, with Quincy Jones music featuring legendary harmonica player Toots Thielemans. Perhaps he played at their wedding, they were married 5 yrs immediately after this movie. I do not think it was a shotgun wedding. The movie is a lot about shotguns. The cast is outstanding along with Brando's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Al Lettieri, Slim Pickens, Ben Johnson. It is after all a story of violence amongst bank robbers and corrupt cops, exciting car chases of course, with famed stuntman McQueen teaching Ali McGraw how to drive and shoot. I nevertheless love this Peckinpah film. I liked seeing them together Steve Mc Queen and Ali McGraw, and I really wish we could see something like it today in our movie theaters.

That is where are the origins of \"The Getaway\". Third aspect is that Sam Peckinpah was approximately the first director of the new direction of Hollywood. He openly tried to use the abolition of Hays' code. His movies were filled with a load of violence unparalleled before. \"The Getaway\" refers to that rule as well. It supposed to be a kind of a crook tale, where interactions with violence were treated as an element of fun.An experienced thief is released from prison. He must pay for his freedom by getting involved into another heist. Despite the many complications, the bank gets robbed and the main character has nothing left to do, but taking care of disloyal partners and the police. And his must forgive his wife an affair.

            "content": "Let me start to say that i'm not keen of remakes, but like John Carpenter's upgrade of \"The Thing from Another World\" ('51) directed by Howard Hawks, in his horror cult classic \"The Thing\" ('82), Roger Donaldson's taking on Peckinpah's cult classic, \"The Getaway\" fares better in some points, except that without the original to serve as a guide, the movie wouldn't even exists.After \"Junior Bonner\" ('72), released early in the same year, McQueen and Peckinpah joined together again for another venture on screen, this time adapting the Jim Thompson's crime pulp novel, starring the then 42 years' old McQueen, and his mistress 33 years' old Ali MacGraw, then married with producer Robert Evans (\"Chinatown\").Peckinpah's gritty visual style, the use of frantic chases, slow motion shoot outs and well staged on-screen deaths are patent here and he don't disappoint in that matter, except the narrative is a bit messy, the editing is poor in places (some unnecessary scenes went on forever) and the characters lack juice.McQueen never needed to do much: his working class rudeness, but strangely attractive and gracious \"screen persona\"; his display of sarcastic humour; shy appearance, but sweating machismo at the same time and physical acting made his performances seemed naturally effortless and understated and that worked wonders in such movies as \"The Magnificent Seven\" or \"The Great Escape\" and even when he truly acted from his soul like in his only Oscar nominated role, \"The Sand Pebbles\" ('66) and his underrated performance as the title character in \"Papillon\" ('73).Here as Carter \"Doc\" McCoy, McQueen made more use of his tough guy star power (and his own major ego) than the method acting skills that allowed him and Martin Landau to have been the only 2 students out of 2000 to be accepted in Actor's Studio back in '55.Now don't get me wrong, McQueen is one of my all time favorite actors and always a riot to follow, even a not so good McQueen is way better than a lot of actors doing their best on-screen, but here he was paired with his real life lover, Ali MacGraw, who seriously lacked acting range, and he looked and acted more concerned about her and their relationship than the characters they were playing and the respective storytelling.Peckinpah was always plagued with problems on the set of his films, the majority due to his own self destructive bad behavior and alcoholism and the constant clash between him and the producers or the actors he was directing (like in the ill-fated \"Major Dundee\") and \"The Getaway\" was not an exception to the rule, he and McQueen disagreed and had different views about how the movie could be and the end result was more of a McQueen's film than Peckinpah's (or even Jim Thompson's) vision of it.Troubles and some low points aside, \"The Getaway\" still delivers the goods as an action / crime / drama / heist flick from a way influential (as much as controversial) filmmaker, which his techniques and visual style influenced a lot of future brilliant directors such as Walter Hill, William Friedkin, Michael Cimino, John Carpenter, Roger Donaldson or John Dahl.Now, comparing with the remake, the Donaldson's movie was undeservedly bashed by critics and i find it just a case of picking on the newly weds, Baldwin & Basinger's media attention, because the '94 version is better in those aspects:Alec Baldwin was good and credible as Doc, even if he wasn't McQueen, but Kim Basinger is a way better actress than Ali MacGraw and tops her as Carol McCoy.James Woods is way more sleazy and had more screentime than Ben Johnson, who was too nice and harmless for Jack Benyon and only had a couple of scenes, his character is forgettable, but not because of the actor's fault, Johnson was one of the best character actors that ever lived, i blame it on the screenplay and direction.Cool cat Michael Madsen presents Rudy here as a ruthless \"Mickey Rourke-ish\" rogue biker and acts circles around Al Lettieri, who was a too ugly, without style and brute criminal that it's hard to believe why Sally Struthers would fell in love with him, but Madsen gave Rudy an edge, the viewer will hate him and sympathize with him at the same time and he have a great on-screen chemistry with Jennifer Tilly which was also better than Struthers.Richard Farnsworth, Philip Seymour Hoffman (in an early screen role), Burton Gilliam & David Morse were all more memorable than their counterparts, the Peckinpah's stock actors: Slim Pickens, Bo Hopkins, Dub Taylor and the other guy that i can't even recall the name.Hill's screenplay on the remake gives early on an antagonism between \"Doc\" and Rudy and it's way more justifiable the consequent betrayal.The pacing and editing are a lot better, Donaldson shortened the chase that starts at the station and then through the train, that in the original ran for too much time, and have less of bland moments such as Ali's snail reacting to McQueen's dialogue or actions.The final shoot out is much more suspenseful, stylized and entertaining as well as violent in terms of deaths, but strangely the general mood it's way more lighter than the gritiness visual style of the original and in that matter, the '72 version takes the prize, because it was made in the 70's and the Lucien Ballard's cinematography is better than Peter Menzies Jr., no doubts about that.Last, but not least, Donaldson's creative change of \"Doc\" as a dark haired G.I. model-type of an anti-hero & Carol as a 40-ish blonde bombshell and Rudy as a long haired red / blonde biker & Fran as a \"girl next door\" brunette, the complete opposite of the two couples in the original film.In short, i give the same rate to the original movie and the remake, because i love them both and the creative team of Walter Hill / Roger Donaldson had all the work and motivation to study the Peckinpah's film and enhanced the more negative aspects, delivering then a more well-structured piece of work, but without the '72 version used as a lighthouse to compose the shots, sequences and mend the narrative, it would never have been done, so....",

Funny, how little sympathy or respect we have today for such a coward, but this movie is making him a sympathetic character.  Sure, his wife slept with the Ben Johnson creep in order to spring him from prison.  Wouldn't you?There are exciting car chases of the bad guys chasing the bad guys. But Steve and Ali always left anywhere with squealing tires, which doesn't make a lot of sense if you're trying to be unobstrusive. The only good guy is Slim Pickens, and of course, Steve does a Robin Hood and sets this guy up for life.  Only fair, since Pickens pulls his chestnuts from the fire.The subplot of the really bad guy who kidnaps the vetaranarian and his wife, Sally Struthers (not begging for money for her starving kids, for a change) is fascinating.  She plays a neurotic tramp, who throws her boring husband over for the psychopathic crook.  His action with her bra is hilarious, but you feel for the husband as he is bound up and forced to watch the two go at it.The blood flows, and you actually see McQueen recoil from the force of the gun shot, which is realism like you seldom see in a movie.  Ali and Steve were just beginning to boil over into what became his 2nd marriage at this time.  She was about to leave Robert Evans, which is all nice to know while you're watching the movie.  Steve plays a great robber/convict, and the scenes in the Huntsville, Texas prison which show the tremendous stress that in-jail humiliation does to someone were very well done.  It makes his capitulation to the really bad guy on the parole board all that more believable. Oh, yes, and never let anyone put your valuables in a locker for you.  What a con!",

It gets better when you add the fact of escaping to a place where money is even worth more than face value. The trick is, can you get there? I have always liked McQueen and his acting and he doesn't let you down for the realism on the subject matter. Definitely recommend sunflower seeds or you will nail bite or smoke. Good movie to snack by and have a tasty drink ready to go. No cell phones or bathroom breaks or you interfere with the tension which builds quite nicely. BTW...the true mark of a good movie is seeing it again and again because it has memorable scenes. This be the case here",

Along with his resourceful wife (Ali McGraw) and some dubious cohorts, including nasty Al Lettieri, McQueen knocks the bank over with ease, only to get involved in an extended chase with everyone turning on each other. Left for dead by McQueen, Lettieri kidnaps a veterinarian and his daffy wife (Sally Struthers) and plots his revenge. It's all very fast paced, at times fairly comical (particularly the Lettieri/Struthers \"romance\") with all the actors in top form (even McGraw is tolerable with her flaring nostrils and perpetual scowl). McQueen and McGraw have great chemistry. With the great Richard Bright as an unlucky grifter and the oddly cast Jack Dodson as the vet who helps Lettieri only to be tortured.

There are some exciting chase sequences and, eventually, the obligatory shootout, but there's a slick quality to most of the movie that put me off.  Worst of all, the central relationship between Doc (Steve McQueen) and his wife (Ali MacGraw) is completely unconvincing, and much of the dialogue is laughable.  The subplot involving Doc's double-crossing partner forcing the Sally Struthers character and her milquetoast husband to drive him across Texas in pursuit of Doc and Carol is the best (funniest, most disturbing) part of the movie.",

            "content": "This is a highly entertaining film, but its conclusion has no connection with either the plot or the themes of the original novel. Happy, or even nearly happy, endings are almost nonexistent in Jim Thompson's novels, but someone, presumably Steve McQueen, the producers and financiers, felt competent to impose a traditional \"triumph (sort of) of young (sort of) love.\" Doing this is comparable to letting Hester Prynn tell the busybodies off in \"The Scarlet Letter\" or imposing an improbably heroic ending on \"The Natural\" - yes, it can be done, but it undercuts what the author was trying to say. In the case of those other adaptations of novels to the screen, the originals were well enough known that such dissonances were obvious, and such was reported in reviews (moreso for \"The Scarlet Letter,\" which was a bad film on any terms, than for \"The Natural,\" which was, like \"The Getaway,\" good unless you knew what had been done to the original material.)Well, the primary requirement of a film is that it entertain on its own terms: I give it an 8, with the understanding that the novel's bleak end would have been not only depressing to the audience, but probably a bear to film. As is often the case, Jim Thompson's ending signifies more the deranged and deteriorated mind of the protagonist than any easily depicted \"reality.\" Perhaps I would have found a faithful rendition of Thompson's original work less satisfying than this. McQueen is great, as are Ben Johnson, Al Lettieri and most of the supporting cast. Ali McGraw is a very limited actress, but I thought more of her performance here than a lot of viewers: She got the job done and made Ben Johnson's double dealing completely understandable.",

A parole that gets denied, so he sends his wife Carol to a local Texan Jack Beynan, who has political connections, to make a deal. Miraculously the parole board changes it's mind and Doc finds himself released but indebted to Beynon. Beynon wants him to pull a bank job of his choosing and with a crew of his choosing. Doc and his wife Carol stake out the bank and the getaway. Doc is less than thrilled with his new crew of two, but doesn't have much of a choice.Doc's instincts prove accurate as during the job one of the crew (Rudy) ends up shooting the security guard and then shooting his partner when they split up...Rudy and his partner and Doc and Carol. Rudy then goes after Doc and the money, who shoots him and leaves him for dead...only he's wearing a bulletproof vest. Rudy takes a veterinarian and his wife (played by Sally Struthers) hostage to patch him up and nurse him as he goes on the run after Doc and Carol, who are going through their own series of misfortunes.This was an interesting film and more about a couple on the run than anything else. I don't know if this is typical of Sam Peckinpaw or not, but I did find the prison footage in the beginning really interesting as it was a working prison. It was a great expression of the monotony of prison life, working or not. There is also a great scene where Doc and Carol end up in a garbage truck that has a compactor...that made for some interesting footages.Probably not a recommendation from me, but the first Steve McQueen film that I watched...I am hoping Bullit is better.",

I cannot imagine anyone else playing this part with greater poise and presence. However, I'm British. McQueen is good on the whole, but I equally can't help saying that he tends to annoy and irritate me slightly. Perhaps it's because he always seems a little bit full of himself, setting out to steal whatever scene he's in. He watches himself being cool, especially without dialogue. And he doesn't do all his own stunts, as it's claimed.None of this matters, since the film is directed by Peckinpah, who is very clearly one of America's consistently great film directors. His films get better the more you watch them, though some of them are remarkably unpleasant. Not this one, though Lettieri comes close. I must watch it again, to see why Mrs McCoy is collecting all those offensive remarks for no reason. This movie is perhaps the nearest Sam ever gets to a comedy. It's light on philosophy. The baddies get theirs, and the good guys get away with murder. No honour among these thieves.",

The movie was edgy for its time. It is based on a novel, but there were changes to the source material. There are some long sequences that could have been tightened out, particularly between McGraw and McQueen. McGraw's performance was panned but it is not bad-I think the additional scrutiny over her romantic entanglement in this film after her husband of the time, Robert Evans, fought to get her the role didn't help.
