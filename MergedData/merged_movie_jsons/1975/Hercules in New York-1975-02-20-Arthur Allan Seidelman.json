            "content": "Over a decade before his movie career exploded and eight years before even Pumping Iron, Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in this cheapie B comedy playing the Greek demigod Hercules, who has been banned from Olympus by Zeus. Schwarzenegger can barely speak a line of coherent English at this point (the film is probably more commonly seen with his performance dubbed, but his original voice is available nowadays). Funny thing is, he's by far the best actor in the picture. Everyone else is just cringe-inducingly awful. The movie as a whole might have actually been watchable, if it weren't for the painfully stereotypical Jew performance by Arnold Stang, who dominates much of it. The film has Schwarzenegger (dubbed Arnold Strong) doing Schwarzenegger-ish activities like weightlifting, throwing cars around and getting into various fights. What would you do if you ran into a 22 year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger and he was annoying you? Start a fight? Well, if you're in this movie, that's what you do. It happens like ten times.",

            "content": "This is a very bad film--there's no denying this. Imagine having a young Arnold Schwarzenegger (whose command of English was MUCH worse than when he did his movies in the 1980s) playing a Greek god who comes to New York for a few laughs! Now the concept COULD have actually worked--if the leading man hadn't been barely cognizant of the English language. And, had the writers not been chimpanzees, the story could have been turned into a cute little tongue-in-cheek tale. But, in the end, through total incompetence, it's a dreadful movie. BUT, for people who like watching stupid films and laughing at them, then they are in for a treat with HERCULES IN NEW YORK! The film begins in a very minimalistic Mount Olympian headquarters for the gods. Including the cost of the pillars, I think the set was created for about $47.50. Well, in this sketchy looking layout, the gods are all standing around when Hercules announces he's bored and wants to go back to Earth. Zeus forbids him and they argue. Ultimately, Zeus tosses him out of the sky onto the earth and from here on Hercules has a lot of adventures. For the most part, Schwarzenegger plays the role like he's a lovable moron...goofy and looking a bit like Jethro Bodine when he first went to the big city! Among the exciting(?) adventures he has are various wrasslin' matches, fighting an escaped bear (a guy in one of the worst bear suits I've ever seen) and hanging out with Arnold Stang--a man who has somehow learned to talk entirely through his nose. I'd tell you more about the story, but really don't think it's all that important. Suffice to say, Jethro runs around New York (often with no shirt) and gets into wacky trouble.As far as the research for the writers goes, I think they'd have been better off if they'd read a few comic books or asked the average high school student for advice. When it comes to knowing even the basic information about the Greek gods, they often got is completely wrong--mixing Greek and Roman names for the gods again and again (for example, Juno, Venus and Hercules are Roman names and Zeus and Nemesis are Greek) as well as having little understanding (or care) about the gods themselves (Mercury was NOT Hercules' brother, Pluto was NOT the Devil nor did he live in Hell, etc., etc.). In addition, at the end of the film, Samson (from the Old Testament) and Atlas (whose job it is to hold the Earth) come to the rescue! There are also two versions of this film. Traditionally, the version most have seen has a dubbed voice for Arnold, as he's occasionally barely comprehensible. But, this is also really silly as the voice is very robotic and obviously not his. This is the case with the version posted on IMDb (though, oddly, this version also lacks music and many basic sound effects). For those wanting to see and hear Arnold, the DVD has the original restored voice--but won't give you the option to hear either one. Additionally, at the end, when he talks to Stang from the radio, it's NOT Arnold's voice but that of the robot-dude.Overall, the film was a shoddy and silly mess. But there was a certain goofiness that make it fun to watch despite its many, many obvious shortcomings. Not a good film at all, but fun to watch if you need a laugh.",

My personal favorite is, \"I do nots care abouts ze zundaboats.\" I don't think that line can ever be topped.  And who can not laugh at the New York traffic sounds on Mt. Olympus.  This movie may be the most underbudget, worst film of all time, but it's Arnold and it's great for a laugh.  If stupid things make you laugh then this movie is a must.",

This is simply one of the most hilarious movies you'll ever see, it's filled with absurd scenes. And it's acted out to perfection. The combination of Arnie, and Pretzie, it's just magic. Pretzie overacts as badly as you can imagine, Arnie doesn't act and he does that as badly as you can imagine. But those aren't the only noteworthy performances in this movie. Check out the refinement of the screaming girl, in the infamous bear-attack scene. There are just so many little things in this movie, little details in every single aspect of this movie, that make this so extremely funny and entertaining. It just ignores even the most basic of things needed for a good movie, and it is exactly that, what makes this so good. Watch this movie, you won't be able to say that it is average, that's for sure.

What saves this movie from the lowest possible rating is its lack of pretension; the people involved in it must have known that they were making a bad movie and didn't try to hide it at all. For example, when Hercules fights a bear, there is no attempt to make the bear look even slightly real; it's all-too-obviously a man in a bear suit.    (*1/2)",

            "review_title": "The funniest movie of all time!",
            "content": "Arnold Schwarzenegger. Way before he was Governor of California. Way before he was the Terminator. Before Conan. And yes, even before Pumping Iron. As a matter of fact, this was even before Arnold won a single Mr. Olympia, and was still only Mr. Universe. Arnold, age 23, is Hercules. In fact, he isn't credited as Arnold Schwarzenegger, but as \"Arnold Strong\". This movie, intentional or not, is one of the funniest, if not THE funniest movie of all time. The movie is extremely low budget, has horrendous acting, mind-blowingly sub-par special effects (even by the standards of 1970), and an overly-redundant soundtrack. Let's take a closer look.Hercules is bored with life on Mt. Olympus. The movie starts off with Hercules complaining to Zeus, and telling him that he wants to leave. After a few minutes of back and forth arguing, Zeus gets angry enough at Hercules to throw one of his lightning bolts (which look like they were welded together in a junk-yard) at him, and in a puff of smoke (cheap special effects) he disappears. Turns out he has fallen to earth, somewhere in the middle of the ocean. On his way down, he passes by an airplane, on which an extremely crazy lady with a funny voice and an even funnier hat sees him as she looks out the window, and has a fit.Here, he is picked up by a freighter, and tells the captain that \"no man is superior to Hercules\". He spends the rest of the voyage picking fights with the crew for no apparent reason. It is during this scene that John Candy makes his first ever (uncredited) appearance in his movie career. When the ship reaches New York, Hercules goes ashore, and is attacked by a group of hobos, who he takes care of with a wooden plank. This is where he meets \"Pretzi\", played by Arnold Stang. They hitch a cab ride, only to find out that Hercules has no money, because \"Hercules needs no money\". The cabbie tries to beat up Herc, who yells the hilarious line of \"HOW DARE YOU TOUCH HERCULES!\", throws him in the bushes, and flips over his taxi.Herc and Pretzi run off, and somehow end up in a playing field with college students training in discus, javelin, and far jump. Herc says \"Zoze men don't ssrow it faaar enuff\" and proceeds to humiliate the college students in all events. One hilarious part is when he takes his shirt off and does a titty-dance before throwing the javelin.After this, Herc and Pretzi are invited to a college professor's house and are sitting in the living room with his smoking-hot daughter (Deborah Loomis). At this point, her friend comes in, and after an exchange of words, he punches Herc in the gut, to which he replies \"YOU have strucked Hercules!\" and hoists the young man into the air.Hercules and the hottie end up dating. It is during their first date that they encounter an \"escaped bear from the zoo\", which is actually (quite conspicuously) a man in a bear costume. Herc pounds the bear into submission, with his girlfriend screaming in the background. This scene has to be one of the funniest in cinematic history. During one of their outings, Herc sees a poster of a Hercules movie, and in his outrage rips off his shirt in the middle of the street, starts posing, and demands to know \"who gave zees imperzonator permission to imitate Herkooles!\" Before long, Herc becomes a wrestler. Long story short, Pretzi is threatened by the mob to sign Herc over to them, and he does as he is told. Eventually, Herc goes up against \"Monstro the Magnificent\" in a weightlifting match, which he loses because Juno took away his powers. He gets jumped by the mob, and then its Atlas and Samson (yes, the biblical Samson) to the rescue. In the end, Herc goes back to Mt. Olympus.For one to fully appreciate this movie, it must be watched with Arnold's real voice, although the dubbed version is great for laughs too. This movie is an absolute jewel. It is so horrible that it's great. It has an innocent charm to it as well, and one can't help but love it. Arnold's acting is virtually nonexistent, and he exhibits less emotion than when he played the Terminator. This is balanced out by Arnold Stang's constant over-acting. Deborah Loomis is smoking-hot, but her acting skills are below average. Hell, everyone's acting in this movie is below-average. This movie contains literally dozens of hilarious one-liners by Arnold. The Mt. Olympus scenes are all filmed in Central Park, and traffic can be heard in the background. You know what? I'm just going to stop here. There are too many hilarious things to list. Go watch it!",

The fact that anybody invested as much as a nickel in a script that one monkey working for one hour could easily have done better is what really blows my mind. The premise is painfully stupid, and the execution of it is as heavy-handed and amateurish as anything you're likely to see.

While in the Big Apple Hercules befriends excitable squirt Pretzie (a lively and funny portrayal by Arnold Stang, who's the best actor in the whole flick), becomes both a wrestler and a body builder, and mixes it up with a stereotypical bunch of no-count Italian Mafia types. Director Arthur Seidelman, working from a blithely inane script Aubrey Wisberg, relates the gloriously ludicrous story at a zippy pace and pitches all the dopey humor at an appropriately broad level. Gut-busting campy highlights include Arnold beating folks up as often as possible, Hercules overturning a cab because he has no money to pay the fare, Hercules duking it out with a bear that's obviously some poor zhlub in an unconvincing moth-eaten suit, a televised weightlifting competition with the boom mic constantly dipping into the frame, Hercules commandeering a chariot, and the priceless ending with Zeus coming to Earth as a Hasidic Jew (!). Arnold's extremely poor and frequently borderline incomprehensible elocution, the chintzy (far from) special effects (Zeus' thunder bolts look like they are made out of plastic), John Balamos' infectiously goofy'n'giddy Italian music score, and the sequences on Mount Olympus that were clearly shot in Central Park (you can even hear traffic noises in the background!) all further enhance the considerable hilarity of this absolutely sidesplitting cruddy riot.",

Pretzie is the ultimate everyman, selling pretzels by the water and figuring out ways to nickel and dime everyone and pocket the loose book every now and then. But he gets into trouble and has moments of revelation and regret. Hercules' simplicity and god-like physique, as well as Monstro the Magnificent's lopsided hair cut, symbolize the yin and yang of life and death, bigness and smallness, truth and the GOP.The frequent unfocusing of the shot shows that mankind's mind is frequently unfocused and Arnold's partially literate accent represents the garbled marbles we often use to express the inner desires of our hearts.

Falling from the sky into the sea, Hercules is picked up by a ship travelling to New York, where he meets friendly pretzel salesman Pretzie (played by Arnold Stang, the voice of Hanna-Barbera's Top Cat), falls in love with professor's daughter Helen (Deborah Loomis), enters a strongman competition against bodybuilder Monstro (Tony Carroll), and upsets local mobsters in the process.Arnold Schwarzenegger's screen debut is shoddy nonsense that will test the patience of all but the most dedicated Arnie fan. The star's thick Austrian accent renders his dialogue laughable, the movie's intentional humour falls flat, and the plot is a meandering mess that feels like it was thrown together on the fly. Production values are incredibly low, most notably in the scenes set on the supposedly tranquil paradise of Mount Olympus (actually filmed in Central Park), where the props are cheap and nasty and the action is frequently interrupted by the sound of New York traffic and car horns.That said, Hercules in New York is almost worth seeing just for the hilarious sight of the future governor of California wrestling a grizzly bear (actually a man in a very unconvincing moth-eaten bear costume).Also look out for a guy who looks a lot like John Candy (the jury is still out on whether the bloke in question is actually the portly Canadian comedian in an uncredited role, but I wouldn't have blamed Candy one bit for not owning up if it was him).",

            "content": "With today the day Maria Shriver officially files for divorce from Arnold Schwarzenegger (serves him right too since he betrayed her by cheating on her with the maid and had a baby with her, to boot!), I thought I'd watch the former Governator's first movie that he made way back in 1969-Hercules in New York. I saw two versions: the first that I watched on Hulu had no music score and Arnold's voice was badly dubbed by another though compared to his real one, you could hear each word clearly and the second one I saw on YouTube which had his accented voice not always easy to understand (which made his confused mix-up on \"bucks\" and \"dough\" with \"bucs\" and \"doe\" not as funny) though it had a good Greek-like score. The rating for the first version is above while the other take gets a 4 from me. Arnold is credited as Arnold Strong since, I guess, his co-star happens to be Arnold Stang. Stang is such a one-of-a-kind presence that he brightens most scenes he's in. The only other player I recognized was James Karen who I knew from Poltergeist as well from a guest spot on \"The Golden Girls\". By the way, when Stang died in December '09, I couldn't help but think of his other roles like the voice of Herman the mouse in those Herman and Katnip cartoons, his role as Frank Sinatra's friend in The Man with the Golden Arm, and his recent roles in \"The Cosby Show\" and Dennis the Menace. Oh, and while I knew one player couldn't be John Candy since this guy was much older but Abe Holiday on that dock sure looked like him. So on that note, Hercules in New York is interesting for the early role of Mr. Schwarzenegger, not to mention his thick accent, and not much else though one can't completely hate a movie where Hercules fights an obviously bear-suited man. P.S. It was disappointing to hear that dubbed actor again instead of Arnold on the radio at the end of the second version especially since it was much softer this time around.",

            "review_title": "An Awkward Children's Movie",
            "content": "As a child, I have seen movies that really grab the viewer's attention and have lovable characters that make a lasting impression. Children's movies like Gumby: The Movie (1995), Thomas and the Magic Railroad (2000), and Space Jam (1996) all have the things a child could ask for. As for Hercules in New York, the film definitely made a lasting impression but on the weird side of things. Sponsored by the Tooniversal Company, this piece of cinema is fun to watch for nostalgia purposes only.This is Arnold Schwarzenegger's first film debut as the man who is part god, and part human. The story starts off when he is up in Olympus where he wants to be sent down to Earth because he is tired of hanging around with the Gods. So he argues with his father Zeus, who gets so livid that he sends him down to New York. Wait a minute, Zeus didn't want Hercules mingling with humans, so why was he sent down to New York in the first place? Why was there even an argument? Whatever.Along with Schwarzenegger is Arnold Stang, who plays a character called Pretzie, a wimpy man who carries a basket of pretzels in the first part of the film that he's seen. From there, he no longer holds a bag of pretzels, what a surprise. I will say, the actors picked for the roles of each character were picked accurately, but I'm not saying their acting is good. Stang plays as good wimpy character, and is funny to see his eyes bulge. Even Schwarzenegger is good as Hercules, but that's because of his physique and I assume that's really all he needed. That is one of the nostalgic points in this movie; Schwarzenegger's muscles. It's amazing to see how big he really was in the 70s. The other part that is nostalgic about this film is to see what SOME of New York looked like back then, but that's about all the viewer will get.What makes this movie so awkward are how the scenes are done. There are moments where Hercules is supposed to be doing something extraordinary. Instead what he does looks cheaply done and the sound effects don't help. Hercules knocks (more like love-taps) a man into a bay, and the splashing water makes it sound like a pebble was tossed. What? Who would have thought these brutes were made of confetti? There's even a scene where Hercules fights a bear. Yes a bear, and it doesn't even look like a bear. The viewer will be able to tell that this is not a bear, but a person inside a bear suit. To make matters worse, Hercules attacks the bear by slapping it; yes slapping it. Schwarzenegger slapping? It's really ridiculous to see The Terminator (1984) beat up a bear so poorly. As for the damsel in distress, Deborah Loomis, I have never heard so much screaming, almost as much as Kirsten Dunst in Spiderman (2002), if not more. My ears were ringing after hearing her. She even faints in once scene, and it didn't even look real. As for the music, which was composed by John Balamos, is not a whole lot better. I can't even tell what kind of instrument is used but it's not an orchestra I'll say that much. A lot of the music is the same and it sounds really corny. I'm really surprised Schwarzenegger has become such a box office hit by starting from this movie. This film obviously did not get him famous but if he had not auditioned for the role, we may not have any of the Terminator movies or Total Recall (1990), whatever. When the film finished, I was barely entertained and shocked to how bad the film was compared to its trailer. What shocks me even more is that the director of this film is still making movies today!Hercules in New York is a very silly kid's movie that may not even entertain the smallest of ages. Much of the scenes in this film are stupid and the only thing that may catch the viewer's attention is Arnold Schwarzenegger's bulging biceps.",

Hercules is tired of laying around in Greece all the time speaking German and takes a trip to New York. A guy that vaguely looks like Woody Allen takes him under his wings and they get into oh so lighthearted adventures. To be frank I expected more ass-kicking from Ahnuld. He barely ever gets into fights and when he does he really just pushes the bad guys around a little, probably because the production values are low and they couldn't get those cool sound effects you get after punches(that go \"doosh\" and stuff). To give you an idea of the massive thought put into this movie,the script called for a bear and the director had a brilliant idea, putting some hobo in a bear suit bought from some guy's trunk. Luckily our hero Hercules is on the spot real quick to not punch the,ah well I'm in a good mood,bear. Meanwhile the not so pretty love interest is screaming her lungs out dead afraid of this short, skinny bear that has been standing on two legs for ages. Another action scene breaks out when Hercules joins a contest that should determine who the strongest man in the world is. And of all the ways that can pop up in your head, they go for the very lame idea of just lifting three different weights. I was at least expecting some wrestling or so but no, just lifting stupid weights. And if his opponent can lift 1000 pounds, why the hell did it already take the guy so much effort to lift 500? All these comical misadventures (there's more,but I can't work up the courage) are constantly interrupted by scenes of Zeus sitting in the director's back yard, I mean uhm, Greece. Yeah that's what I meant. This movie is even too stupid for my taste.",

            "content": "After sassing his father, Hercules is sent to Earth as punishment despite the risks (he is half mortal). After being rescued at sea, several hundred miles from land, Hercules works on the ship as it travels to New York. After fighting off some longshoremen, Hercules is befriended by the geeky Pretzie who takes him to Central Park where the pair spy some men engaging in athletics. Hercules comes to the attention of Professor Camden and his daughter with the degree of his physical powers and this is only the start of his adventures.Although this film had been easily voted into the bottom 100 on this site, I was curious to give it a go mainly to see where the current Governor of California started his career acting in the movies (Pumping Iron not really being acting). I don't think I was prepared for how cheerfully inept the entire film would be and I was actually quite held by just how laughable it all was. The plot is utter nonsense and you can tell it has been written in terms of key scenes because there is no narrative flow \u0096 just chapters that stop before another starts. The direction is terrible \u0096 very 1970's and very low budget with seemingly very little concept of framing a shot. The dialogue is about as clunky as you could imagine and not a single word of it is natural.Of course it doesn't help matters that the cast would make a kindergarten play look like the RSC in full flow. Schwarzenegger was yet to become the star he would be a decade or two later and his performance is wooden and stiff. His physical presence is undeniable but it is hard not to laugh at his accent and delivery. Of course nobody else is any better and everyone is just as wooden and unconvincing. Stang is a basic geek, Loomis is sexy but couldn't read out directions convincingly while Karen, Burstein, Goldsmith and others are just as bad. Special mention to Graves though, who is not only terrible but also has a hilariously bad beard.Overall a terrible film that only has value as part of the extraordinary story of Schwarzenegger's career. The story is rubbish, the script it pathetic, the direction aimless and the cast a perfect lesson in how to be wooden and dull. And as if that wasn't bad enough that terrible Greek theme tune gets played endlessly throughout. Oh, and the bear fight? Classic. Say no more.",

Production values never rise above porno level (Zeus' kingdom consists of nothing more than a plastic throne and a couple of drapes, filmed in a public park!), and the sound quality fluctuates from shot to shot (you can hear traffic somewhere beyond the aforementioned 'magic' kingdom!!). On top of the meandering plot and rotten visual effects (get a load of the 'rampaging grizzly', actually a guy in flea-bitten bear suit!), the movie is further handicapped by Schwarzenegger's dreadful performance - he's fine while showing off his torso, but his flat monotone delivery is in sharp contrast to some talented supporting players, including well-known character actors James Karen and Richard Herd (what were they thinking?). If nothing else, however, the movie provides an opportunity for viewers to feast their eyes on Schwarzenegger's magnificent body, which he displays at every opportunity. Oh, and look out for the scene in which he steers a horse-drawn carriage down the middle of Times Square, an iconic image which transcends the rough material in which it's featured.

I'm giving it 2 stars on a \"real\" grade scale because of its camp appeal, but that doesn't mean it's not an entirely enjoyable film.This is Arnold Schwarzenegger's first screen role, and you can really tell: his delivery is stiff as a frozen tree, his expression more dead than a zombie that's had its head removed, and his English is nearly incomprehensible gibberish that will make you laugh at every turn (\"I am tired of ze zame old zings!\").Everything else in this movie goes wrong too in about a 100,000 ways: for example, the gods are supposed to be Greek, but they often refer to their comrades by their Roman names, which were invented centuries after ancient Greece's prime. The effects are a riot: Look out especially for Zeus' \"lightning bolts\" and the unforgettable bear fight scene where Ahnuld fights some poor guy in a bear suit.Even the sound isn't right: you'll hear cars humming in the background during scenes that are supposed to be set on Mount Olympus and the dialogue is occasionally out of sync. But the crowning achievement of this film's awfulness has to be the soundtrack, which is basically one song playing during every important scene over and over and over again. Despite being completely hammered during watching this film, I still wanted to launch the DVD into outer space.Recommendation: In all seriousness, this film is T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. But it is a marathon of laughs if you get hammered with your friends and pop this camp turkey in. Just remember what I said about the soundtrack.",

Hercules in New York -- aka Hercules Goes Bananas -- is a classic! I don't understand how those who, like me, fall off their chair laughing can give this movie only one or two stars. A flick with this entertainment value should get a high rating, not a low one. I mean, do you not want to share the joy it brings with others? For me this one ranks up there with Plan 9 from Outer Space and Manos Hands of Fate as the best worst movie ever made. Ahnold should feel honored, and he has such a great sense of humor, I doubt he really wants to burn the copies -- I'm sure he showed it to his kids, and it will be passed on to his grandkids and great grandkids. Same with you. Wouldn't you like to see your grandkids's faces -- let's say, as teens, so they can be in on the joke -- when you show them one of your \"favorite movies\"? Not Apocalypse Now or Sleepless in Seattle, but Hercules Goes Bananas! OK, let's start with Ahnold. Yes, I think his is his first real dramatic movie, and I use \"dramatic\" only technically. I mean, this is pre-Conan, and you know what a wonderful actor he was in that. Then there's the voice dubbing. Now, in my copy, the voice has nothing to do with Arnold. (I know others insist it's his.) I hope your copy has this voice, because to hear it coming out of Ahnold's mouth is very, very moving. Then, there's the soundtrack. Bazuki music! What can I say? Then, there's Arnold Stang. Arnold Stang??? Stang was one of the more serviceable comic supporting actors of his day, which by the time he made this was long past. But never mind...to cast Stang as the sidekick reveals to me that the producers really didn't mean to make a serious movie. It's like casting Woody Allen for the part and making him play it straight. The result is beyond bizarre.What you do, if you're still young enough to have fun being silly, is to find a Friday night or Saturday afternoon and invite you best friends and have brewskies and weed and watch as this thing unfold.By the way, I took off a point because, after all, it is terrible.",

Arnold Stang gives your typical comedians acting performance and Deborah Loomis is quite cute. I know it's Arnie's first movie, but he is awful. There is not one scene where there is any hint at a successful acting career in his future. Since the US production company went bankrupt, the movie was never released in theatres. In his Autobiography Total Recall, Arnie recalls how he was thrilled to be paid $1,000 a week for his work on the movie, and best of all, he sent a photograph home to his parents saying \"You see?

Its obvious Arnie could'nt speak barely any English and it just adds to the humour, some of the acting is just appalling the grisly bear fight will stay in my mind forever, the actor in the suit acts more like a gorilla than anything and as soon as Arnie sees the poor bear he begins to beat the crap out of it, well more of a play wrestle than anything then his girlfriends actress trys to faint.... after looking at the camera and screeching some garbage about beating him up. How she became an actress is beyond me. Anyway if you want 90 minutes of unadulterated crap that will make you cry with laughter then check out Hercules in new york!",

This one is played out like a high school play with bad dialogue and some bad interpretations of the myths. Arnold could be a fair Hercules, but not then, and obviously not now. The actors playing the gods have no idea of the characters they are trying to play; I would have thought the Olympians to have kept up with the times. The music is also lousy and the plot is quite ridiculous as it goes no where. It merely circles Hercules confusion and disenchantment with modern civilization. Lets face it, Vanna White in \"Goddess of Love\" looks like Emmy material compared to this.",

Because it is. \"So why oh why have you given it a score of three as opposed to a score of one or two?\" you might ask. Well, the reason is that it is the most unintentionally hilarious movie that I have ever seen. It is listed as being an \"Action/Comedy/Fantasy\" which would lead one to believe that it is meant to be funny. I saw the version in which the mighty Arnold speaks for himself in his customary Austrian brogue. I have not seen the dubbed version so I don't know how much of the comedic value the movie loses based on Schwarzenegger and his dialogue being the funniest part of the movie.It's the parts that are supposed to be serious that are the really funny bits of this movie. Such as Arnold regularly proclaiming (with an even thicker Austrian accent due to him not yet mastering the English language) \"I am Hercules\". Having a weightlifting contest with Arnold Stang and pushing over N.Y taxis.I'm a huge Schwarzenegger fan. I always have been. But the irony is that in the late-1980's he felt the need to display \"range\" as an actor by trying to branch out from his heavy-hitting actioners into comedy with movies such as \"Twins\" and \"Kindergarten Cop\" but the fact of the matter is that Arnold for all his trying was at his funniest right back at the start of his movie career.If you are a fan of Arnold and love his inimitable manner of delivering lines. You need to see this. Ignore the non-existent plot and acting and just roll along on the river of cheese in a film that is so bad it is hilarious.Three is a low score, yes. But when you consider that this movie should have a score of one you know that those additional points are on comedic merit alone.",

It's Fun!!.The Legendary Hero...The movie with Muscle.This muscle-man epic displays action , adventures , mythology, bizarre and luxurious scenarios and results in a quite amusing flick , but being a really inferior film . The movie has not mythological accuracy , neither expectation historical ; however , showing up here and there some Greek Gods , such as : Zeus , Nemesis , Juno , Venus , Mercury, Atlas and Pluto .There're 300 pounds of stupid , being a lighthearted fun in which Hercules appears in Manhattan and he beheaves likes a geek fish out of water and eventually becomes a professional wrestling superstar . Arnold's original classic with a lots of fights , muscles , and several silly scenes. He plays a comic role that allowed him to develop his humorous talent while showing off his prodigious muscles. Stunningly cheap special effects like the shots and close-ups of a giant bear that's a man suited struggling against H\u00e9rcules . Despite its appealing nature to the general public, the film failed to arouse much interest , but today it is considered a cult movie due to being Arnold's debut film. A few years earlier , some hunk men played this hero in great number of movies and was randomly assigned the identity of H\u00e9rcules , Goliath or Samsom for US version . As Arnold Schwarzenegger took the role from his American weightlifting companions , such as : Dan Vadis who played Hercules the invincible (1964) , Triumph of Hercules (1964) ; Brad Harris who acted in Samson against Hercules (1961) , La furia d i Ercole (1962) , Hercules (1983) ; Mark Forest who performed : La vendetta di Ercoles (1960) ; Peter Lupus or Rock Stevens in Ercole contro i tiranni di Babilonia (1964) ; Reg Park, who had previously played Hercules in the Haunted World (1961), and Hercules the Avenger (1965) , Gordon Scott in Ercole contro i tiranni di Babilonia (1964) , Hercules and the pricess of Troy (1965) and , of course , Steve Reeves in Hercules (1958) , it is followed by Hercules unchained (1959) . So Reeves paved the way for other pumped-up acting hopefuls as Ed Fury, Mark Forest, Reg Park and others to seek their fame and fortune in Italy as feature-length Samson, Ursus or Colossus, and nobody, came close to topping Steve in popularity ; however , the giant Arnold Swarzenegger stayed in the US where he got big hit . This lumbering motion picture was lousily directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman. And subsequently , reissued track was restored . This Hercules in New York(1970) film also titled Hercules goes Bananas at 75 minutes and Hercules , the movie at 82 m.

Basically Hercules (Schwarzenegger, billed as Arnold Strong) is bored of life on Mount Olympus, and Zeus (Ernest Graves) expels him to Earth, where he ends up in 1960's New York. He quickly meets Pretzie (Arnold Stang, who I've seen in Dennis, and does the voice of Top Cat), and with no experience of the human world, he gets into many bad situations, but with new love interest Helen Camden (Deborah Loomis) to help, he acclimatizes and starts to enjoy the city life. Zeus of course wants him back eventually, but after sending Pluto (Michael Lipton), who takes back the message Hercules wants to stay longer, Zeus sends Nemesis (Taina Elg) to send him to Hell. During a test to beat Monstro (Tony Carroll) to see who is stronger, Nemesis instead takes Hercules' strength, and makes him as vulnerable as any normal man. In the final battle, Hercules is saved by the arrival of Titan Atlas (Dennis Tinerino) and biblical hero Samson (Mark Tendler), and goes back to Olympus, while Zeus decides to have his fun on Earth. Also starring James Karen as Professor Camden, Tanny McDonald as Juno, Merwin Goldsmith as Maxie and George Bartenieff as Nitro. Apparently Schwarzenegger had such a thick accent, that his voice was dubbed, I couldn't tell, I think they only chose him to flash his pecks and muscles, which he does do quite few times during. As for the film itself it didn't make me laugh, and it didn't excite me, a pretty stupid attempt at a fantasy comedy adventure. Adequate!",

Aarnold Swarzenager stars in it, but they dub his voice to make him sound American, which is especially awesome since he's Hurcules who would have been Greek.

This is a perfect opportunity to see him at this stage in his life, he frequently removes his top showing off his massive physique, plus of course plenty of muscle flexing. I know that this film got dubbed but thankfully my DVD actually has Arnie's real voice. He was nicknamed the Austrian Oak and acting doesn't come any more wooden than his performance here! His very thick Austrian accent is occasionally difficult to understand but I wouldn't have it any other way. Pairing up with Arnold Stang Herecules is a straight up comedy, silly and very cheap looking, but funny too. Shot entirely in New York the numerous scenes of the Gods and Goddesses on Mt.

On the plus side, the print I watched had some nice shots of the city. The night scenes in the park weren't as technically accomplished, nor were some of the interior shots--I think they needed someone better on lighting. The fight scenes made me want to instantly fast forward. You couldn't stage a less interesting struggle. And the final 15 minutes or so were less fun than the buildup.

Naturally he ends up in New York. But being self-centered like a child does not sit well with many in New York, and Hercules often finds himself in trouble. Luckily he is inhumanly strong and like all the gods, invulnerable. However, Juna, the wife of Zeus who has always hated Hercules for being one offspring on one of Zeus little \"adventures\", sees an opportunity. She changes Zeus orders and takes his godly powers away. Suddenly Hercules is all human, and in deep trouble.Comments: This is a old one, from the time when Arnold was as fit as ever and hadn't learned to act yet. He wasn't his smooth-talking smooth-acting self yet (ehum), in this his performance is really stiff. However, that's not really a problem. Like any movie with Pamela Anderson (i.e. Barb Wire) this never has any other intention than showing of the main actor. With embarrassingly bad special effects and a weak story this resembles such movies very much. All the way to the point were Arnold for no reason rips his shirt off and shows his huge muscles. Actually, Pamela and Arnold is totally interchangeable, well besides that they \"speak\" to different halves of the audience.Otherwise the movie was rather bad. Bad dialog, weak story and as stated really bad special effects. For example, once Hercules wrestles a bear in Central Park. I just wished they could have tried to conceal the fact it was an actor in a fur dress. It must have been embarrassing for the director to have to have scenes with the \"bear\" running about, not being able to walk very convincingly.However, there is a reason to watch this. Of course it is because it is Schwarzenegger's debut. The future star and governor took his first steps on the screen in this movie, and bad as it is, it has some funny moments. The sudden appearance of Samson and Atlas to help Hercules is one. But it is only for those who like B-movies or enjoys stars first stiff steps on screen. Those also might want to keep an eye out for John Candy in his first (uncredited) role.The best part of the entire movie is like a prophecy. A part of the dialog brings up the topic of kings in the mortal realm between Juna and Nemesis. Nemesis explains that they have no kings but presidents. Juna then states that a king is a king whatever he calls himself and fears that the mortals might make Hercules king because of his powers. She was not that far of, speaking of the Governator\u0085 3/10",

            "content": "From my perspective, the career of Arnold Schwarzenegger is pretty much astounding. Despite appearing in roughly forty or so films, Schwarzenegger has always had one of strongest track records in terms of pure entertainment value. While not every film Schwarzenegger has appeared in has been great, I've never seen one that I would consider to be a \"bad\" movie. Some of his efforts have been disappointing, some a little more lackluster than others, but I've never thought of any of them as not worthwhile. With Hercules in New York, I stand corrected. I've never been able to track down a copy of this infamous film and I assumed it was always for good reason. Having just caught Hercules in New York on Encore today, I can safely say that the movie is not only the worst flick of Schwarzenegger's career, it's also potentially one of the worst ever made in terms of quality. The camera work is amateurish, the sound is awful and hard to listen to throughout, and the production values are Dollar Store cheap. Yet there's still a small part of me that can recommend 'Hercules' for its curiosity value. The movie is watchable, albeit barely. Where else can one find Schwarzenegger wrestling a man in a giant bear suit? Is there any other movie in which Schwarzenegger tips over a New York City taxi cab in anger? And, despite it getting annoying after a while, Schwarzenegger repeatedly saying \"I'm Hercules\" in every scene is way funnier (either intentionally or unintentionally) than it has any right to be. I have to assume that the filmmakers were fully aware that what they were making was far below quality work as I can't imagine any person thinking the final cut was releasable. The one positive aspect is that Schwarzenegger certainly looked the part to play Hercules, but he'd probably be the first to admit he probably shouldn't have taken the role. Schwarzenegger has made fun of the picture in recent years so, at the very least, he recognizes its many many shortcomings. But I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't love to hear Schwarzenegger do an audio commentary for this gem. For people that love bad cinema, Hercules in New York is not be missed. For everyone else, including hardcore Schwarzenegger fans, there's no reason to ever really watch this. 3/10",

He ends up in a strongman competition...but loses his strength. A series of mishaps then occur.It's a great film which will be enjoyed by today's movie fans.

Deborah Loomis should not be an actor and Ernest Graves should have been playing a role more suitable (like Santa Claus) to not suck totally. The terrible guitar playing which every time there was a fight or a car chase came poring out of my poor speakers made my ears bleed. Aubrey Wisberg should have done the world a favor and stayed out of the filmmakingbusiness. The story is simply stupid and gives no meaning what so ever. The fact that you in the scenes that were you see Zeus in heaven can hear traffic in the background did not help this movie.

One of the worst movies of all time has got its recipe. Maybe I just got the wrong version, but Schwarzenegger can barely speak English in this movie (I've heard somewhere that he was dubbed).Not just acting and low budget makes the movie the one of the worst ever, I bet it was thought as some hobby-project, the camera adjustments are cheap and bad. If you want depth in the movie, you've got to switch between adjustments pretty often, and not film the same person in the same angle for two minutes, even when he's not talking. You've got to use at least two cameras.*****A POSSIBLE SPOILER*****The lightnings that Zeus has, you have to use more trustworthy theatrical props than reinforcements bars. At least you have make it so you cant see from outer space that they are made from reinforcements bars*****POSSIBLE SPOILER IS OUT*****.Frankly, everything in this movie is just sad. Actually you do feel sorry for the poor filmmakers who probably tried to do a good funny comedy. Well, it is funny (not 'coz of the plot) but it still ain't good. Anyway, you might as well see this movie if you want a lesson in bad film-making. But if you are a person who just likes to see good movies and want entertainment you don't want to see this movie.

It was quirky and cute, and fun to see Arnold give his acting debut, but after 30 minutes... there's almost no cohesive story at all, and the co-star ARNOLD STANG as PRETZY THE PRETZEL GUY, who is in almost every scene, is UNBEARABLE. He's like a cartoon version of Woody Allen who tries to be funny but isn't, ever. There are a couple standout scenes, like when Hercules fights \"a bear\" in Central Park, LOL.... but, The last hour is VERY difficult to enjoy. It just meanders and even Arnold can't save it.

Most of the time during this movie, a thought was knocking in the back of my head: \"Were they seriously trying to make a movie?\" I guess they were. The directing, acting, special effects.. mein gott! The acting is so bad, that it makes you squirm in your seat. Arnold is trying soo hard to remember his lines, that most of the time it shows on his face. I guess they just needed a big muscular dude to walk around NY and reading a few lines.And the banjo... Ooooh the banjo.. My god make it stop! The banjo is played during all of the action scenes, and it's almost always the same tune. In the beginning it makes you laugh when you hear it, but when the movie is halfway through, you start to tear your hair out because of it.But when not watched seriously, this movie is so hilarious, that I almost crapped my pants in many of the scenes. One of the first lines that Aahnuld says always gets me:\"Let me be ze judge of dat, I am tired of ze zame old facez, ze zame old zings!\" - Dear Christ Jesus help me Lord that accent is damn thick.

I guess they just found some workers at a ship nearby and offered them a dime each to take part in this scene. The bear in the park was so badly made that you have to see it to believe it In the scenes with the Greek gods at the Olymp, you often hear car horns in the background.

Why? Well its so bad its good, as many cheap films are. The soundtrack can only be described as 'Greek plate throwing music'. The supporting cast are all diabolical, save for Pretzie, a dwarf like New Yorker who for some reason becomes Arnie's buddy and follows him round everywhere. Pretzie has to be seen to be believed, his squeaky voice alone is worth hours of laughter. The 'special effects' for want of a better phrase are awful, but this adds plenty of character to the film. Much of the action defies belief. If you enjoy terrible films for their comic value then watch this!

Here's why I think it's a work of absolute genius.The perfect cast - you get Arnie as a Greek god, he's got the body for it but not the accent and if you think he sounds a bit Austrian these days you should hear him back when this movie was made. Other great casting includes the poor man's Woody Allen and the goddess of beauty being a bit, well rough to put it bluntly.The exotic location - what a stroke of genius filming the entire movie in and around central park during rush hour! The blaring sound of car horns definitely sets the scene for a far off mystical paradise. What I especially liked is the way in one scene Zeus glares at the sound of the sound of traffic like he's just about had it and is going to snap. The speech about the peace and tranquillity of Olympus being drowned out by the sound of traffic is a nice touch too.The action - the tagline for this movie invites you to \"See Him Topple Two Ton Newspaper Rolls!\", I'm not sure about two tons but newspaper rolls are indeed toppled so you can't complain there. In fact there are lots of \"oh look, he's really strong\" moments with the poor man's Woody Allen simpering over our heroes ample muscles. So funny, though strangely the laughter dies when the film tries to crack a few gags.The bear - I saved the best to last. Arnie gets attacked by a guy in a really cheap bear suit, possibly a pervert. In this scene the guy in the bear suit is met with two immediate challenges - 1) how can I stop this pitiful bear suit from falling off me and 2) The strongest man in the universe is beating the crap out of me with rather too much enthusiasm like maybe he doesn't realise this is just acting.Brilliant fun from start to finish, probably one of the funniest bad movies ever - If I ever feel sad I watch this film, it always works.",

Then, in May, I was walking down the aisles of Walgreens, but this time, I had four bucks to kill! So instead of blowing it on candy, I blew it on this movie, and it was a four bucks worth blowing. This film is very enjoyably bad. Arnold's acting is very wooden, and I always make fun of the way he says \"Hercules\". The budget looks very TV movie-Esq. I love Zeus, even though he looks like he really doesn't want to be in this movie. I love how the fight scenes are barely fight scenes, they're either pushing or tossing. The editing is very bad, as well, mainly the scene where Hercules is showing off his \"mad\" Olympic-like skills. We see him jump, then people with wide-opened mouths, and then Arnold land.It's a shame that this movie isn't celebrated like the way I do. It should be worshiped for how bad it is, like Plan 9 or Manos. I say, whenever there's a new movie about Herc coming on TV or to theaters, forget that and pop in this flick!",

I did find it rather odd though, that in almost the last scene, with Zeus on his throne, that there was significant background noise from passing traffic. I think that scene was an afterthought, as they did not film it in the beautiful gardens they used for Mount Olympus earlier. It was just a throne stuck in a small park somewhere in New York with lots of traffic noise in the background, which was very obvious. Worth watching if you want a lightweight fun film without expecting anything professional or a big budget. Or just to see Arnie's first acting role. I did hear somewhere that his voice was dubbed for this, but it seems as if it was mostly his real voice, except at the end on the radio, when the man is listening he thinks it is Hercules speaking but the voice is totally different to Arnie's. At various times his voice did sound like someone else's, but mostly it sounded like Arnie's voice.",

Arnold obviously was still perfecting his use of the English language (some argue that he has yet to do so) and his errors make for the some of the films funniest scenes. The film is supposed to be comedic, as shown by the track and field events, but it's Arnold who makes the film as funny as it is.

I'm not a fan of \"bad movies\", but I'd seen clips of this on television and it looked like an interesting debut for Arnie.The clips I'd seen were dubbed by some American actor, which looks ridiculous now that Arnie has become so established. However the DVD only had the original Schwarzenegger soundtrack, which proved to be just as ridiculous. People complain about Arnold's accent now? It was so thick in this film, backed up with terrible acting (made his performance in \"Commando\" look Oscar-worthy), it's no wonder he was dubbed. You can barely understand a thing he says. As terrible as this is though, it's one of the main reasons to see this.The concept of the film is ridiculous, it perhaps could've worked if it didn't take itself so seriously (ironically, it wouldn't have been as funny though). The thing that really disturbs me is that human beings conjured up this film, adult human beings. They wrote it, it was approved, people agreed to have a part in it, it was directed, it was shot, it was acted, it was edited, it was released, and people actually watched it.I only watched it once in its entirety, and that took a few sittings (despite its short length). It is mostly a very tedious experience. Thankfully there are some stand-out scenes that are absolutely (and unintentionally) hilarious. The bear wrestling scene for instance, it was like something from a Monty Python sketch. I found scenes like this were actually worth re-visiting, and the only reason anyone would want to keep this in their collection. I later sold it though, it just had no place on my shelf.Of course this film would be so much easier to dismiss (probably less ridiculous, and even more tedious), if it weren't for Arnie. It is the fact that he has since been cemented as one of the biggest movie stars of all time, and this is where he started. Although he'd already established himself as a body builder at this point, he continued to win more contests, became a huge international movie star, is now the governor of California, and might even be President one day, all with a thick Austrian accent. Looking at \"Hercules in New York\" is a reminder, there's hope for us yet. 2/10",

You have Struck Hercules!\" \"Fine Chariot, but where are your horses?\"The film begins in the secret gardens of Olympus (located in a public park in new york, complete with New York Traffic sounds and its own camera crew). Hercules asks his father, Zeus, to let him go down to earth for no reason what-so-ever. His father instantly gets so ticked off that he decides to throw a plastic wand at him and Hercules instantly gets sent to earth. Now the script gets interesting.Hercules flies past a window (and an old granny gets turned on) of a plane, and then falls into the sea, which is bizarre, as he was flying a few seconds ago.Zeus sends help and Boom! Hercules is picked up by a boat. He gets off the boat. Then, he decides to beat up everyone and pushes a man into the water (well, he gives him a shove and the actor does a dramatic leap of faith into the water.) Then we meet the mistake of the film, a Pratt called Pretzzy.(Arnold Stang). His irritating voice gives you a brain hemorrhage, and you pray that he will get out of the story as soon as possible, but no, he follows \"Herc!\" around everywhere. He gets a taxi and gives \"herc!\" a pretzel, which he describes as: \"food of Z gods!\" Then, he gets dropped off at Central Park, and they cannot pay the driver. So, they get into a bitch-fight and \"Herc!\" pushes the taxi driver into the bushes.A few minutes of insecure running clips later, he turns up at a sports event, and nothing happens. \"Herc!\" then gets to go to a gals house and stuff, then nothing happens for another 20 minutes.After that, Hercules takes out the gal for a horse ride through central park, which changes from day to night in a matter of seconds. The next action scene is an amazing Grizzly Bear fight scene.The grizzly bear, which A) Looks like a European Bear fancy dress costume and B) Appears to be living in central park doing no harmsuddenly gets lepta on by Hercules and starts doing a wrestling match, throwing punches at each other and ends up as the gal does a hilariously stupid faint.I hope you enjoyed reading this, for I have waisted too much of my time writing it.

I mean I thought Arnie was stupidly funny in Twins but this one definitely takes the prize!! I once heard that the makers of the movie had dubbed over Arnie's voice because his English was so utterly crap at the time, but I was pleasantly surprised when I bought the DVD because there was an option on whether you wanted Arnie's voice or the dubbed one. So if you haven't seen this one and you plan to see it on DVD, YOU MUST CHOOSE ARNIE'S VOICE! Or you will miss out on all the fun of the movie.Oh, and try to spot Richard Herd who played Supreme Commander John in the sci-fi show \"V\", he is in there!",

            "content": "o you know why Arnold is flexing? Because this is the first ever film starring the then- aspiring bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger. In fact, this is the only thing that he is doing the right way in the whole movie-flexing.arnold is flexingArnold's debut motion picture is a raw and hilarious representation of the young version of one of the most successful men in the world.Schwarzenegger's evident lack of on- screen experience make this movie looks more like a documentary on bodybuilding.But first things first.The plot:Taking place back in 1970 when Arnold is still an adolescent, the movie tells us the story of the powerful gods of Olympus- the home of the Greek Gods.The plot centers more on the life of Zeus and mostly on his son Hercules (guess from the first time, which Austrian oak took the role).The young Hercules is spending his glorious but boring adolescence in Olympus- a kingdom far above the clouds among his divine family. One day he decides to disobey his father's will and escapes to earth.There, he is starting to explore things he has never experienced before- he falls in the trap of love and he struggles to become an undisputed bodybuilding champion.The cast:What cast?! Only Arnold is important here. He is also the only known name in the production.In fact, by the time, he was only a young bodybuilder who was trying to make his way to the Hollywood top, just like many other aspiring actors with a certain amount of self-esteem.This is a Funny Action Movie because:Like previously noticed, this is the first Arnold movie ever! He is so inexperienced in acting that you risk to have shortness of breath from laughter while watching the young Austrian desperately trying to be an actor.Originally, Schwarzenegger's voice was dubbed because he barely spoke English at the time. Later, however, when the DVD version was released, his own voice was included in the movie.It won't be far from truth to state that once the DVD version of the film was released, it gained international success. It is just my personal opinion here but I believe that it is due to the fact that then, for the first time, the world heard Arnold's legendary and ridiculous Austrian accent. And that changed everything.The plot is so primitive, the directing so poor and the acting so bad that it hurts. The whole movie is a complete nonsense from the beginning to the very end.It is like someone decided on Tuesday to make a movie and on Wednesday it was all wrapped up and ready to be on screen.The cast is disturbingly inappropriate and the acting is pathetic.But wait!Isn't it exactly what we are looking for? That's right. That is the whole idea of it.It is a sick fun and be sure that it is enjoyable. Arnold's accent is terribly hilarious and God forbid, don't watch this movie dubbed!Just experience Arnold crying out like a five year old retarded child \"I am Hercules\" a thousand times or \"No man is superior to Hercules\". The accent, combined with his funny face moves can easily make you go into spasms of laughter.Make sure that you don't miss the part at the beginning of the movie when he complains to his mighty father Zeus that he is \"tired of the zame old zings, the same old facezz\".At this time, you won't be sure if by the end of the movie Hercules will become bodybuilding champion but somehow you feel that he will definitely win the \"who got the most ridiculous accent\" competition.The funniest part is when Hercules is walking on the street along with his hot date and spots a bodybuilding competition poster with some tough man on the cover.He immediately goes angry and jealous. With the blink of an eye, he tears up his tight t-shirt and starts flexing his giant muscles in order to prove to his girlfriend that his is the God of the gym. He moves like a wounded panda. It is truly spectacular to observe.Another great scene is the scene with the bear. The extraordinary muscular Schwarzenegger takes his girl on a romantic carriage ride. All of a sudden, a bear comes out of nowhere and stands in front of the carriage roaring loud and menacing the lives of the couple in love.What do you think happens?Arnold jumps off the carriage and starts a spectacular one on one fight with the bear. I won't put spoilers here. I would just mention that the animal activists might get angry.During the whole movie Arnold's expressionless gaze and stiff acting are combined with the boring and inappropriate soundtrack, dramatically dull actors and poor directing. The dialogue is also very, very bad.Conclusion:Not only this is a must-see movie but if you ask me, it even should be included in your bucket list right after the \"parachute diving\" check off.Seriously, this gem perfectly serves its purpose-to distract you, to make you feel good and to make you laugh no matter if you are an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan or not.www. funny action movies.com",

Both Arnolds (Schwarzenegger and Stang) are fun to watch, and the rest of the cast is okay if not particularly memorable. The original version of the film had another, un-credited actor providing the voice of Arnold's Hercules due to his thick accent, but the DVD version, as well as the version you can catch on TV these days, have restored Arnold's real voice to the soundtrack, which really helps. Overall, it's good fun and if you go into it not expecting too much, you'll emerge at the end having had a pleasant if not unforgettable experience.",

            "content": "In the modern world of CGI this and stunt double that, it is easy to forget the brilliance a simply made film can achieve. With 18 surprise (so surprising no one even heard about them)nominations for various Oscars back in 1970, Hercules in New York proved that good acting, continuity and most of all an actual plot are entirely disposable in the creation of a movie. The film begins on top of Mt. Olympus where Hercules is pleading with his father to be allowed down to earth. Zeus, however is adamant that Hercules remain on Mt. Olympus, an argument ensues and in his fury Zeus throws a thunderbolt at Hercules, sending him to Earth. Which is exactly what Hercules wanted. Funny that. When upon Earth our noble hero sets about picking fights with people smaller than him, attacking animals and taking up funding from gangsters. He also befriends what many believe to be the most interesting character ever created in cinema-\"Pretzie\". A lonely soul \"Pretzie\" (so called because he sells pretzels)wanders the streets of New York alone. Selling pretzels. Many believe the pretzels to be a metaphor for small African children, and Pretzie to be a man dragged into an illegal trade by a society that doesn't care. Had the film been made thirty years later Pretzies main customers would undoubtedly have been Madonna and Angelina Jolie, however this was not the case, and some poignancy is distracted from Pretzie's plight as a result. Hercules in New York also boasts the finest action scene in cinematic history- Hercules versus the Bear, in which our protagonist, upon seeing an escaped bear, decides the best course of action is to beat the living crap out of it in front of his date. The fight can be seen here- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQhBGDOO4-w (about 50 seconds in the action starts) To conclude I think we should all try to take on board the meaning of the last line of Pretzies big, final speech: \"Yeah. I think- I think I'll have an apple\"",

I find them rather annoying, and I wonder what society has come to when a man with the all-around ineptitude of Schwarzenegger gains the demigodhood moviegoers have known him for. \"Hercules in New York\" is an exception. Not because it's a good movie--it's definitely horrible. But it does have an unintended laughter quality that redeems it.It's common knowledge that this is Ah-nold's first movie. Fresh off his bodybuilding days but pre-steroid abuse (you can tell these things by looking at him), he is Hercules, half-mortal and half-god son of Zeus, king of the Olympian gods. Well, kinda. There's a crapload of stuff taken from other myths as well. Anyway, Hercules has lived on Mt. Olympus for thousands of years, and is bored. So against Zeus' wishes, he goes down to Earth to have some fun.By now, you gotta be thinking, \"what a stupid plot.\" True. The acting is also mostly, but totally, bad. There's also really bad dialog. And the action scenes look like a the writer based them off a playing session two children had with action figures.But that's the charm. You'll laugh throughout the movie, particularly young Arnold's miserable attempts at acting. It's the kind of movie that you'll laugh at, make fun of, and have a howling good time watching. Particularly when Arnold is driving a chariot and wrestling an obviously fake bear that moves like a gorilla.\"'Hercules in New York' is the touching tale of an Austrian bodybuilder who thinks he is a Greek demigod. he doesn't fit in, but a little bad dialog and flexing of his body gain him instant adulation.\"Yeah, that's the kind of bashing you might give this movie.So go get a bag of popcorn, a bag of popcorn, and enjoy this movie.

For a while it was just bad, but then there was the fight with a bear, which had escaped from the zoo. First, you hear on the police report that the bear is a \"grizzly,\" one of the largest and most aggressive bears in the US. When the camera pans over the cage where the bear was held, the sign distinctly says \"black bear,\" a much tamer species. Then we actually see the bear. Or, at least I think we do. It looks more like a small ape with a bear's head. Probably because it's a guy in a really horrible bear suit. Ah-nuld proceeds to lay the smack-down. Hilarious scene. And then there is Hercules' sidekick, a Jewish guy named Arnold Stang, and the most stereotypical Jewish character ever. It's terrible, but ironically funny. What's even more strange is that the director and the producer were both presumably Jewish, and yet they wrote in a ridiculously stereotypical Jew.This movie jumps into my number one spot of \"Movies that are so bad they are great,\" leaping over \"The Scorpion King.\"",

The editing is terrible sound keeps changing per frame (As a film student I would get failed for such sloppiness), the lines are cheesy but funny in an unintentional way and that bear fight.I guess the reason I find it so funny is it reminds me of the half assed films me and my friends have done bored when nobody can act and lines seem stupid.I urge you to watch this film at least once big Arn has come along way.",
