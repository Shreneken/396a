            "content": "By the time Sidney Lumet's \"Dog Day Afternoon\" came around he had already learned to let Al Pacino loose. Forget the holdbacks of \"Serpico\"; here we get a glimpse into the real Al, the actor who would bring Tony Montana to life in the years to come and the same man who provided Michael Corleone with such heartfelt warmth that was lacking in some of his lesser characters.There's essentially the Al Pacino as an actor and the Al Pacino as a character, and here he's the character, and it works splendidly. Al Pacino the actor comes into play when he is given a recycled script and a talentless director, which has been happening a lot lately, although fortunately his comparison, De Niro, has been lucky enough to generally avoid these blunders of older-age film-making.This is based on a true story, like \"Serpico,\" only it's better and more involving. It connects with the audience more than \"Serpico\" because it doesn't jump through the same old hoops; it goes for the long trek and comes off better than it would have had the team behind it been lazy. The clich\u00e9s are gone and the originality creeps in early on. Watch Pacino indulge himself in character and let the plot sink in. It's more touching than it seems at first.Pacino is Sonny Wortzik, a Brooklyn man who takes a bank hostage in order to pay for his \"wife's\" operation. The wife is actually Leon Shermer (Chris Sarandon who was Oscar-nominated for this, his first role in a mainstream film), Sonny's gay lover who doesn't have the money for a sex operation.The bank robbery was going to be what one of classic cinema's greatest bad guys once described as a quick \"in and out,\" but Sonny gets held up inside the bank and soon he's all over the news and police are standing outside the building with guns drawn. It's like Denzel's movie only better and more original. Oh, and true. This one actually happened and we can tell.Sonny's partner in crime, Sal (John Cazale), is worried that he'll be treated as a homosexual by the media outside. His fretting is comic relief and one of the connections between the film and the audience. Charles Durning is the frustrated cop handling the situation. His performance is as subtly convincing as Cavale's.Pacino's performance is exceedingly excellent, manic and energetic. He'd display this same talent in \"Scarface\" again eight years later; only he would be bashed by the critics for going over-the-top. (Although they really just had problems with the excessive profanity and violence, just like Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\" will soon become a well-known classic and people will laugh when they hear that someone once called it the most violent film ever made.)There's also one of the best scenes of all time in this movie that rivals Montana's Last Stand in \"Scarface\" or the Baptism Scene in \"The Godfather,\" which involves Sonny speaking on the phone to his \"wife,\" carefully concealing his motive from any listeners nearby. Watch Pacino delve into character here and you're immediately hooked. We like his character because he seems real and Pacino makes him real, and that's why this will go down as one of the best tour de force performances of all time.Is this Hollywood trying to ease our culture onto homosexuality and sex change operations? Is Hollywood trying to gradually introduce us to gay characters in the hope that the uptight American families will be increasingly invaded by the images of gay men? No. This is Hollywood showing us a true story, regardless of the homosexuality. Pacino could be playing a frustrated postal worker and it would still work because it all settles down to the fact that the suspense and dramatics of the movie affect us, not the background of its characters.Sarandon's Oscar nomination was more than worthy; here he displays the smarmy talent that would shine through in his characters in the years to come. Prince Humperdink from \"The Princess Bride\" is equally memorable but less realistic. Here he seems more real, which is good for this film and would have been quite bad for \"Bride.\" We don't like real characters in fantasy tales, do we?Lumet, who ruined \"Serpico\" with his bad editing, out-of-place music, clich\u00e9d dialogue/events and unnecessary scenes, directs \"Dog Day Afternoon\" with style and flair and good pacing and a surprisingly heartfelt sense of emotion and care. This isn't exactly a good example of a perfect motion picture but it's pretty close.",

            "content": "I've watched this film for the third time in a few years last night. Instead of writing a straight review, I'd like to jot down ten thoughts just off the top of my head concerning this exquisite movie: 1) Watching this film will change forever your perception of the bank heist genre, making you question the contrived cinematic conventions these films usually make use of.2) The source of this film's paradoxical and/or farcical elements spring from life itself, not from film or pre-existing cinematic conventions. Sometimes, the absurdities of life are so great, they dwarf those included in any form of fiction. Without even trying to make that point, this film captures that concept beautifully. 3) Its tone in relation to the homosexual theme is ahead of its time. In fact it's ahead of OUR time, even, in hardly making an issue out of it at all - it just IS. 4) It captures the climate of the 70s in a manner so sober, you'll remember its unshowy yet authentic feel forever.5) Lumet's film brings to life the concept of the distorting lens of the media and how different groups with different agendas will turn an outlaw into a hero, with far more efficiency than Oliver Stone's brash, bloated, childish and repetitive Natural Born Killers.6) Watching this film will illustrate to the younger generations exactly why Al Pacino has earned himself the legendary status he probably no longer would deserve with his performances of the last 10 years alone. **SPOILERS**: Just watch those last ten minutes of him handcuffed against the bonnet of a car, where he doesn't say a word, but speaks volumes with his eyes and his soul just oozing out of every frame at the end of the movie; you'll remember those eyes for as long as you live! 7) Watching this film, you'll realise that firing a gun-shot is a BIG DEAL in real life, and that other films make too much use of gun fire in a highly contrived way. 8) All that tension deriving from pointed guns unable to fire a shot OR move away\u0085 you realise Tarantino must've taken notes sometime along the way. 9) No genre is old or done too many times before if it's handled with this amount of freshness, inspiration and talent. 10) Watching Dog Day Afternoon for the third time has filled me with the same amount of wonder at the power of truly inspired but unobtrusive film-making as it did first time round.",

            "content": "'Dog Day Afternoon' tells the true story of Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale). These two guys went into a bank in 1972 in Brooklyn to rob it. They could have been out in five minuted but things went terribly wrong. Instead of a robbery it became a hostage situation. And a media circus as well.From the first second you will be totally in the movie. Afterwards I wanted to write my review and I was not able to remember how the music was, if there was any. It says something about how much the movie grabs you. The first part is very funny, I laughed a lot of times. The second part is more a drama and a thriller. Great director Sidney Lumet creates a certain atmosphere for the movie that is just right. Pacino in one of his best performances is surrounded by a great supporting cast. He was nominated for an Oscar but didn't win it. He lost it to a guy named Jack Nicholson in a movie called 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'. The chances were probably fifty-fifty and the Oscar went to the better movie, I have to admit that. Still, one of the best performances I have ever seen. With any other actor this movie was a nice one, with him it is a great one.",

            "content": "Brooklyn, New York. Sonny, Sal and another man walk into the bank and hold it up.  Seconds into the job, the third man changes his mind and leaves. The job starts to go wrong when Sonny discovers that the truck he was told was dropping off money, was actually picking it up, meaning the vault is nearly empty.  Things get worse when the police arrive outside and trap the two inside with a handful of hostages.  As Sonny and Sal try to keep control, a circus breaks out on the street with the police, the public and the media all involved.I have seen this film several times but it has been a few years since I last had the chance to see it.  I watched it again today with the memory of it being good but not really as truly great as many seem to think it is.  The plot is all the more fascinated for it being true but it is not an easy subject to bring to the screen.  While morally most people can accept robbers in films as characters to support, it is a bigger step to accept the sexualities and complexities of these characters and to get behind them. However the film actually manages to make this quite moving and difficult - not only do we feel for Sonny but the film is fair to him and, more impressively, Leon. It would have been easy to turn this relationship into a joke but the script allows it to be done with sensitivity.  The rest of the film captures the sense of circus and media feeding frenzy well as well as being quite tense and enjoyable to watch.The film's strength is it's performances and, in particular, Pacino in a performance that is both showy and understated at different times.  He is a real person and it is to his credit that, no matter the revelations about Sonny, he never loses the audience.  Cazale is good here too but in a different way - a simple, sympathetic character.  His hit rate is amazing when you think that he was only ever in a handful of films and they were all pretty amazing, but it's hard to tell how good an actor he was really. Durning is good in support and the rest of the cast are pretty good but it is Pacino's film and he manages well with the shouting, the silence and the complexities of his characters.Overall this is not one of the best films ever made but it is certainly a very good telling of this true story.  The film deals very well with both the tension of the situation but also the underlying stories and characters - even more surprising for the period it was made in, it makes a very balanced presentation of the homosexual characters.  The direction is very good and the performances are all good, but it is Pacino's film and he does very well with it.",

            "review_title": "Pacino and Lumet at their best!",
            "content": "Al Pacino has portrayed some memorable characters in some classic movies like 'Serpico,' 'Scent of a Woman,' 'Donnie Brasco' and the three 'Godfather' Films. 'Dog Day Afternoon' and Sonny Wortzik belong high on that list.As the movie opens, Sonny and his two-man gang are nervously waiting outside a Brooklyn bank which they intend to rob. Sonny has a plan all worked out, but after the robbery begins, it quickly unravels. Not the least dismaying development is that the bank is almost out of cash. Shortly after this revelation, police begin to arrive in numbers that would be able to lay siege to a small country (Wyoming, maybe?) This sets up a hostage situation that lasts the afternoon and late into the night.One might think this setting might make things a little claustrophobic but director Sidney Lumet has handled this problem before; witness his film 'Twelve Angry Men.' The goings-on in the bank itself are fascinating as the moods and relationships of the hostages and their captors develop and change over the course of the long day. Out on the street the crime scene immediately turns into a circus with thousands of onlookers straining at police lines, news media doing everything they can to get close to the story, and a new busload of police arriving every few minutes.Great performances are all over the place here. This is a tour-de-force for Pacino, even by his standards, as the bungling crook who has instantly become the biggest media star in the city. Sonny may have blown the first role, but he shines in the second. One of Pacino's \"Godfather\" brothers, John Cazale is excellent is the less-flashy role as Sonny's partner Sal, definitely not the brains of this operation. Events are soon beyond Sal's comprehension and his subtle performance is wonderful. Charles Durning is super as police lieutenant Moretti who works as hard as he can to keep the situation from spinning totally out of control. He's juggling desperate fugitives in the bank, a crowd growing crazier and crazier, aggressive newspeople, and some of his own cops who are ready to end this thing with a bang. When the FBI shows up, the agent in charge (James Broderick) doesn't even say hello to Moretti. He cooly assesses the situation and decides their plan of action, and from that moment on there is a grim air of fatalism hanging over Sonny and Sal.There are more twists and turns we won't go into here. This is a great work by Pacino, Lumet, and most of the other actors in the film. I loved it.",

            "content": "Sidney Lumet's \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is one of the most highly enjoyable and wildly funny movies I've ever seen - smart, sharp, complex, witty (and often quotable) dialogue, and superbly acted. Al Pacino stars as Sonny, an optimistic loser who decides to hold up a bank with his friend Sal (played by the late, great John Cazale) to get money for his lover Leon's sex-change operation. The film is only worked around a few sequences, and may seem overlong to some, but it works excellently because it is held together by the fantastic acting. Al Pacino is astounding as Sonny, and his work here even eclipses the excellent work he did as Michael Corleone in \"The Godfather\" (and that's saying something, because I adore that movie and his portrayal). Pacino has the facial tics and the energy and the wide-eyed optimism down pat, and his performance is extremely engaging and entertaining. Take, for example, his scene where he rouses up the crowd against the police by chanting, \"Attica! Attica! Put your f---ing guns down!\" A lesser actor would have made it insipid, but Pacino makes it oddly poignant and hilarious at the same time. (And he was robbed of his Oscar for his role.) The late John Cazale is also superb as Sal, the dopey-eyed follower, the quiet laid-back calm to Pacino's maniacal energy. It's a less flashier role, but Cazale still brings on all the laughs, especially in his deadpan delivery of the line, \"Sonny, they're saying there are two homosexuals in here...I'm not a homosexual.\" Frank Pierson won an Oscar for his script for a reason - the dialogue is hilarious, sharp, and witty. Many of the lines in this movie are extremely quotable (and you can check some of them out under \"memorable quotes\"). This is intelligent writing, in the sense that you will laugh and be moved at the same time. Great movie! It belongs in your VHS or DVD collection. 10/10",

            "content": "Outstanding character-study that is unique, interesting, highly-unconventional and definitely brilliant in every way. Two dim-witted bank robbers (Oscar-nominated Al Pacino and the late John Cazale) decide to rob a New York City bank on a summer day in the early-1970s. The robbery is to be cut-and-dry, but nothing goes as planned. Instead of getting away with a load of money, there is only a miniscule amount as the money was transported away earlier in the day. As Pacino tries to burn bank records, a small fire is noticed outside the bank and total chaos ensues. Now the bank is surrounded by the police and the FBI. Charles Durning and James Broderick are among the officials outside the bank as they attempt to negotiate with Pacino to get the bank's employees out safely. It is learned that Pacino is involved in a homosexual relationship with Chris Sarandon (Oscar-nominated) and that his main goal was to steal his share of the money to get Sarandon a sex-change operation. The nervous Cazale is more worried that the media will think he is homosexual than anything else. The film is dark in many ways, very light-hearted and funny in other ways, but always dramatic and tense. As the clock ticks, the realization occurs that this will not end well for the robbers. Sidney Lumet's Oscar-nominated direction is sharp throughout. Based on actual events, \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is another great winner from the 1970s, Hollywood's second Golden Age. 5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "During the late sixties and into the seventies, the bank heist seems to have become a metaphor for the counter culture rebellion. Bank robbers were no longer the villains, but the heroes, fighting against the capitalist establishment like an urban Robin Hood. Dog Day Afternoon is part of that tradition.Al Pacino is, as ever, brilliant. He is able to bring charisma, charm and vulnerability to the character of Sonny Wortzik in nothing more than a way of walking, or the way he holds a phone. Troubled, insecure, confused, Sonny makes for a lousy bank robber. And yet, when he steps from the relative safety of the bank building and into the street, before a hundred waiting armed police, he changes completely. He becomes a strong, proud, prowling voice of the working class, goading the police, riling the gathered crowd. In referencing the prison massacre at Attica in 1971, he becomes a voice for the urban poor, and it is a powerful and raging voice that contains the potential for victory and success, even when you know it is doomed.An incredibly powerful work, very much of its time, and all the better for it. The 1970's was a decade when major studios hired actors for their talent, not their looks or teen appeal. When major studios hired writers proud to take on sensitive political and social issues. When major studios financially backed and strongly promoted movies that mattered and said something. Dog Day Afternoon is the product of that system and as such, could never be made today.",

            "content": "We've seen this story before, but then again maybe not. This is the attitude that director Sidney Lumet takes (as he did with films like 12 Angry Men and Serpico, the later also starring Al Pacino) with Dog Day Afternoon. Bank robbery films are a staple in cinema since The Great Train Robbery filmed in 1903. However this story (not even saying based on a true story, just saying 'this is a true story' is enough) is set in 1972, and filmed a couple of years later, at a time when attitudes in society were changing, as was storytelling. Lumet here could get away with things he couldn't get away with if he tried this in the 50's; with unapologetically homosexual (but truthful is the key) characters, one of them the lead character; surprises that add to the unconventionality of the style of the film; and an ending that will keep you guessing. Lumet did a lot of good with this movie, and in a small way some not so good; people would look at many bank-robbery pictures that would come after this and size them up to this, as it was almost transparently influential (the 'Attica, Attica' tirade is something a child knows years before he actually sees the film).But its the honesty in the truth of the story and problems of the main characters, and in fact the lead up to the robbery and the (unsuccessful) robbery has truth out of it. It is manipulative in a sense, as it is so truthful artifice is almost excluded entirely from the picture. Take when Sonny (Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) first whip out their guns in the bank. Their friend can't take it and wants out. This is a great moment, and the film has them scattered about. In some ways these great parts and scenes make up for the fact that beneath it all is a story that we have seen too many times (the robbers faced with intense media attention, wanting a plane to take the hostages, etc), or maybe not; maybe one has to put the film into context of the period. But a scene, for another example, when Sonny talks to his 'friend' on the phone. This is one of those moments where Pacino is of course as always 'Pacino', but also totally immersed in the character and the situation. Lumet lets this play for painfully real results.Dog Day Afternoon is one of Lumet's grittiest successes, as he takes the city he's made most of his films in, New York, and gives it the right tone, inside the bank and out, for this story of eventuality to unfold. The opening montage, with an Elton John song in the background, really has little relevance to the rest of the film, except to set up mood, and style, and it is a wonderful style (interestingly, the rest of the film aside from this opening is without music, another touch of the gripping realism). In a way, as I mentioned, its almost TOO intense, and too spectacular in the power that it has. This is Al Pacino in his prime, after all, off the heels of Serpico and The Godfather films, with his Sonny loaded with vigor and ambition and delusions of grandeur. John Cazale's Sal, by the way, is equally convincing in his own right, bringing a level of sanity to some of Sonny's over-the-top ideas. This film, and its actors and characters and Dede Allen editing, is almost a blue-print for how many other films that would come after this would take. One almost wonders what's the point of all of it, but when it makes its moments to shine, its dynamite.",

            "content": "The late John Wojtowicz whose mad exploit on one afternoon in Brooklyn probably never dreamed his life would result in an awarded picture. But I suppose the Oscar that Frank Pierson won for Best Original Screenplay kind of verified his time on earth. Not to mention the five other Oscar categories Dog Day Afternoon was nominated in, Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Director for Sidney Lumet, Best Actor for Al Pacino and Best Supporting Actor for Chris Sarandon.It all happened to be sure on Avenue P in Brooklyn, the location that the film was shot on 10th Street was not where it happened, just the same borough. But the film sure comes close to graphically illustrating the bizarre carnival of events that happened in the summer of 1972.Al Pacino playing Sonny Wojcik is a gay man who has left his wife and kids and is now living with a man who has confessed to him he's a transgender individual and the doctors have recommended a sex change for him. The sexually confused Pacino and at that time he was hits on this mad move to rob a bank to get enough money for sexual reassignment. At that time the cost they're talking about is $2500.00 which now wouldn't pay for the scrub nurse. Then as now medical insurance companies won't cover it.So Pacino goes in with buddies John Cazale and Gary Springer and pulls a robbery at closing time at a Brooklyn bank. They're supposed to be in and out, but these guys aren't professional criminals. One thing leads to another and law enforcement has Pacino and Cazale trapped, Springer having opted out of the crime real early.Then the media freak show begins, at first with crowd actually on Pacino's side as he gives lip to the law. Then when they find out what is the underlying motive for the robbery, good old homophobia takes over. The cheers turn to jeers when Pacino comes out in the street for the police and the cameras.Dog Day Afternoon is a key film for the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender community in the USA. It's one of the first that explores a gamut of issues like the closet, internalized homophobia, being forced into marriage for convention's sake, even same gender marriage. It's exploitive to be sure, but does have its tender moments as well. The highlight of the film for me is the phone conversation with Pacino and Sarandon who had no idea what Pacino had in mind. Sarandon gave one of the first performances of a transgender person in a major motion picture.John Wojtowicz, Sonny Wojcik for the film did a stretch in the federal pen for the bank robbery and after he was released I met him. By the time we met, both of us were comfortable in our sexuality, I was most closeted when this incident happened. When we met it was the late Eighties. If I was comfortable, John Wojtowicz was positively reveling in it.Dog as he was then known because of the film was a character in the Greenwich Village bar scene where I met him. Dog used his celebrity, notoriety if you prefer, to get himself a fabulous share of rent boys whom he paid nominal monies for services. He carried ever ready copy of faded clippings from the crime and some of those dumb kids actually thought of him as something special. As a character Dog certainly was.When I moved out of New York I didn't see Dog around any more and he died a few years ago. The man had his fifteen minutes of celebrity and worked it to the max. This review is dedicated to John Wojtowicz as one unforgettable individual.",

I also liked Charles Durning, who did a fine job as the hostage negotiator.  Sidney Lumet is a talented director, who specializes in intense dramas and is good at stirring up the atmosphere for moments of intrigue.The film starts out very engaging, with a premise that locks you in.  The opening scenes are handled really well.  I like how we get to know the characters in the bank on an almost-intimate level.  But the film stretches. It stretches itself a little too long, with scenes that could've been considered for the cutting room floor.  The intensity just seems to dampen as the film passes the halfway mark.  The intrigue is lost, and we're watching soapy interactions between Sonny and his gay lover, as well as his angry wife.  The climactic scene is a little disappointing and could've been more exciting.  I wouldn't rate \"Dog Day Afternoon\" as one of Lumet's best--though it does contain one of Pacino's best performances.  There are some memorable moments, but the film--as a whole--is less-than-memorable.My score:  6 (out of 10)",

            "content": "What transfixes me throughout every scene of this sinewy, offbeat film is the extraordinarily pragmatic realism of the hurtles Sonny and Sal confront inside the bank. Not even twenty minutes into the film, we find we're already seeing things absolutely no other crime film has ever included that are astonishing in their dramatic persuasiveness. The head teller and the bank manager picking apart Sonny's plan with him. One clerk's husband calls and asks what time the robbers will be through so he knows if he has to cook for himself or not. While ordering the bank manager to help him block the back entrance by moving a big desk, Sonny asks offhand why he'd hire a diabetic as a guard, and is told in ordinary person-to-person terms what a guard's salary is and why poor old Howard has that job.And when does Mulvaney the bank manager, played by captivating unknown character actor Sully Boyar, tell hostage-taker he'd like to see his family again but if someone must be taken, take him? When he's helping his captor move a big desk to block the back. They sound like regular working urbanites so caught up in the daily grind of city life that they might as well be making small talk in an elevator. Later, the phone rings, Sonny picks up, it's a sicko telling him to kill 'em all. Sonny hangs up after four seconds, moving on. The female tellers sit and sweat while giggling about the same silly things---\"He said the f-word.\" \"Well, I'm a Christian and my ears are not garbage cans.\"---in the thick of a hostage situation and a media circus. Poignant, real.Every nuance of Pacino's performance is incredibly realistic. He practically possesses the audience, as we can begin to expect certain things from him and care about him because he's played by an actor who completely subsists as him. At points when characters speak of him off-screen, speaking of things that we are surprised to hear about him, that take us aback and color his image, Pacino has prepared the size for those turning points to fit in. His improvised scenes are exceptional as well, and are in fact some of the most riveting, nail-bitingly intense scenes in the entire film. In such scenes, he is matched by the great actor Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon's becoming fulfillment of his role.Indeed, this is by far Durning's most riveting performance. He works so well here because in shouting matches with Sonny, he looks and sounds entirely his age, not a movie character. He's fat, middle-aged, tired, just as surprised as everybody else. He runs short of breath, trying desperately to keep up with the pressure cooking higher all around him. As Det. Sgt. Eugene Moretti, Durning epitomizes the thankless job of a police officer more candidly and perfectly than any other movie cop I've ever seen. One of this stunning succession of brilliant scenes is the first time Sonny emerges to talk face-to-face with Moretti in the street, which begins with a protracted pin-drop silence and slowly, steadily, invisibly culminates in deafening, ear-splitting chaos.Lumet opens the film with a montage of city scenes in NYC with a good getting-up-in-the- morning song like Elton John's Amoreena and with the same indifference ends up on Sonny, Sal and their friend waiting outside a bank in a car, an image that just happens to continue. This is a great way to demonstrate the it-could-happen-anywhereness. Lumet's overall direction of the film is beautiful, indicative once again of the masterful mainstay of cinema in the 1970s. The climactic final ten minutes are ruthless in their steadily unraveling, almost unbearably intense tragedy. It's not only one of the most effective uses of sound to create drama I've ever seen, but everything concludes exactly as it would in reality.",

It's an energetic style of acting that has too much `watch me act' quality to qualify for greatness. But enjoyable.Lumet scalpeled himself to the world class with `12 Angry Men,' where his camera breathed with the same rhythm of the ensemble. Here, he generally lacks that magic, and the writing isn't very tight either.But one scene is immortal, on my list of the best 50 scenes in not-excellent films. The phone conversation between Sonny and `wife' Leon is great naturalism. This is Lumet and company at their very best. Watch how the framing moves, the conversation unfolds, how we are drawn into the most intimate pathos -- how they help us escape the voyerism of the crowds right outside, and the many others listening in.This was Sarandon's first film. His excellence here and his mundane career since (including Prince Humperdink in `Princess Bride') may say something about how a director can weave an emotional potential in others.",

The middle, featuring interactions with the robber's family and gay lover, is just soap opera, causing the film to drag. The film opens with about five minutes of random shots of NYC, serving no purpose other than to pad the running time when it's already overlong. Although Lumet tends to encourage overacting, Pacino is very good and the supporting cast is solid.",

Of course not all goes to plan. An hour later they're still inside and the bank is surrounded. Cops, media, crowds of fans and the FBI are each hanging to Sonny's every word \u0096 and why? Because he has 9 hostages as pawns, a bank as his board and all the time in the world to think up a strategy. Inside the bank however is a different story. You can't help but sympathise with Sonny (due to Pacino's terrific performance) as the first-time bank robber who's unprepared, out of his depth, and just trying to think up a way out. Even the audience begin to feel the effects of Stockholm Syndrome as Pacino's character gains our affections. The 'villain who's a nice guy at heart' could have been disastrously clich\u00e9 but Pacino's portrayal is nothing short of brilliance. Even Sal with his morbid disposition is magnetising as his childlike innocence shines through. Calzale was wonderfully cast as this awkward accomplice, wordlessly following Sonny. A huge success combining the skills of Lumet with the talent of Pacino for the second time in Pacino's best role yet. A true story that's compelling and tragic but most of all tangible \u0096 and that's what makes it so powerful.",

            "content": "There are a few things that separate this film from the average film about not so bright criminals. One, the characters are more realistic in that they are dumb in ways, but they're not entirely dumb. Secondly and most importantly, the film doesn't lean on it's criminals stupidity to create needless or misplaced humor to try to make an entertaining film. Here Lumet relies more on his actors to be more authentic and concentrate on real circumstantial feelings and developing the characters. In the end we have what amounts to by most accounts, the most authentic feeling bank robbery film ever made. This is a film based on a true story and I'm not sure how close to reality Lumet tried to make it, but he sure did create something here that feels very real, and it is also continuously engaging.Nothing is black and white here, everything is gray. Here we are led to understand the criminals motivations fully, and we cannot help but sympathize with them at least to some degree. This is masterful storytelling put to film by Lumet.Dog Day is pretty much as gritty of a film as has ever come out of Hollywood. Lumet is a wonder, and a blessing in cinematic history no doubt. Not only is this one of Hollywood's first ever in depth looks from the so called \"bad guys\" perspectives; But also told so rawly and acted so authentically that almost every person who saw this film found themselves relating to, or at least feeling some compassion for a couple of gay crooks. In 1975, this was a landmark film to say the least. No matter what happens in the world, this will always be an outstanding classic.8.5/10\n.",

The first thing that a discerning eye would notice throughout the film is the undying uniqueness of Pacino's originality. This was just another movie destined to reassuring viewers of Al's status of an icon. The movie itself is endearing and entertaining. Though the movie is supposed to appear like a bank robbing, and in a sense it is, but deep in the heart robbing is simply a way to achieve a totally different goal, of course other than money! It is about affection and mutual caring. It's about what situations a person is ready to embark into in order to show how much he cares for another one. And I guess this is the point of the whole movie, which is stylistically decorated with dozes of sarcasm and pleasantry with sporadic undertones of bravery. The characters are all innocent which innocence seems to relate them to each other. What I deem as very courageous here are the thematic elements, homosexuality. I guess the time when the movie was made the society had still been ruled by prejudiced mentalities that could really ruin this innocuous piece of art. For this, I praise the very daring Sidney Lumet, one of my favorite directors. 10/10",

There have been countless heist/robbery movies since the early days of film-making but this one here hits all the right notes. I think the greatest thing about the film is that we get to see one of the best character developments in film history. The Al Pacino character goes through all sorts of emotions throughout the film that by the time the movie ends we can't help but feel as if we've followed him his entire life. Pacino's performance is one of the greatest of his career and what he does with this character is really something amazing to watch. The supporting cast is terrific as well. What I also love about this film is that there's no music score being used, which makes the film seem all the more real. Another great aspect is the comedy, which is used off and on throughout the movie. There are countless great scenes, including the most famous one but I think the highlight of the film is when Pacino is talking to his \"other\" wife.",

            "content": "You all know the story: a simple bank robbery supposed to take twenty minutes, during a hot summer afternoon \u0085 From a simple but terrific premise, Sidney Lumet made a masterpiece out of one of the most bizarre and memorable media freaks shows, like only the 70's could have featured. With the Al Pacino and John Cazale's tandem back on the road, proving their immense versatility as you totally forget that one year before, in a no less prestigious crime film, Al knew it was John, and gave him the kiss of death in an immortal movie scene \u0085 \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is a thrilling, captivating, and exhilarating experience honoring the zany unpredictability of life. Just when you think you had enough of surprises, something comes to shock, amuse, or disorient you. It's like a sitcom structured by a solid narrative and driven by an amazing Oscar winning script, full of priceless one-liners. And the film inspires so many emotions you wonder if this will have a happy or a sad ending. It's both tragic and comic, sometimes heart-breaking, sometimes hilarious. Like Sonny's ridiculous over-cautiousness to find out that there's no money and worse, that police was already waiting from outside. Not to mention the way he struggled to get the rifle out of the flower-box, the third accomplice who chickened out... from the beginning, the job was so amateurish both the hostages and the audience wondered what was going on. The movie opens with the realism of \"Serpico\" and a nut that'll be very hard to crack, somewhat like \"12 Angry Men\"'s verdict, and a character so sympathetic, while realizing it will be a very long day\u0085 Sympathetic but not pathetic... progressively, there's a revelation. Sonny Wortzik is more than a clumsy bank robber: the guy has nerves, a heart, he acts tough, but is put in his place when he curses. He definitely doesn't want anyone to get hurt. And the genius of the script is Sal. He literally 'salted' the film giving it that thriller flavor, with his scary look and eagerness to kill anyone. John Cazale totally embodies the idea of a man who has nothing to lose, and doesn't want to go to jail. With this ticking bomb of a character, we know it can go wrong at any time. And Sonny's job is to keep Sal calm inside, when he has other business to deal with outside.Sonny is indeed the cinematic incarnation of the man who tries to keep everything on control. His memorable interactions with Sgt. Moretti, Charles Durning in a remarkable performance, even highlight the evolution of this character who, from self-confidence and condescending tone becomes more fatherly towards Sonny, as if he was mirroring Sonny's very psychological situation, trying to keep things cool while cops were all targeting the bank and the crowd coming to watch the show. A modern circus show with Al as the biggest star, and the media as the lions coming to devour him. And what a showman that Sonny! One of the greatest performances from Al Pacino who gives to his character a moral and political dimension forever incarnated by the immortal \"Attica! Attica!\". A general and cheerful Stockholm Syndrome, he wins the people's hearts and ours with one of the most legendary rally cries evoking a lost era where people had the guts to stand for their beliefs. \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is one of the most-defining films of the 70's, with a rebellious mind, and a heart too \u0085And God, the heart of the film... when you expect, you had all the surprises; the best is to come when we learn why Sonny robbed the bank with the entrance of Leon, his 'wife', portrayed in a nuanced but powerful performance by Chris Sarandon as a woman trapped in a man's body. Yep, the movie is full of strong supporting performances. Chris is so convincing we feel this tender love and complicity that could inspire Sonny the desperate idea to rob a bank to pay for his lover's sex change. A complicity translated by the legendary improvised phone-call scene, which genuinely contrasts with the noisier one with Sonny's official (and talkative) wife. These are the elements that placed Sonny Wortzik among the most fascinating characters of cinema's history and made Pacino a legend, with a character who couldn't have been more different than the icy and cold-blooded Michael Corleone. The story provides him a human touch, he's got a life, a wife, a lover, and he lives and leaves them with such intensity we lose the control of the film. We were laughing, now we feeling Sonny's pain as he's dealing with this tragicomedy, his loss of control and of the people's sympathy after his homosexuality was revealed. Al Pacino's eyes burn with an intensity crystallizing an out of control situation. It's dark, sweaty, we can hardly breathe, and the claustrophobic feeling transcends the bank, even the film. The film which concludes as it started, in an abrupt, detached and cold way. The police kills Sal and Sonny begs for life. He didn't want to betray Sal, but in a way, he was so alienated by the whole craziness of the situation, he lost the control and didn't even realize how nuts he's gone, like wondering one minute before his arrest if he'll have food in the plane, or believing he was really going to Algeria. The tragic realization that makes you wonder how this happened, and Pacino's eyes look like he's telling himself, \"how could I have ever thought I had a chance\"...... sanity was back again, the show was over and the movie could conclude.",

Yeah Sonny knows his stuff so why then I wondered did he and his colleagues wear masks ? As his other accomplice gets cold feet why does he continually call him \" Stevie \" in front of the hostage opening the door and keep calling his partner \" Sal \" in front of everyone ? Is there anything more incompetent than criminals calling each other by their names while robbing people ? This tends to contradict Sonny as being a pre meditated robber and paints him more as a lovable klutz doomed to failure This is my major problem with DOG DAY AFTERNOON . It's a film that unreservedly manipulates the audience into feeling great pity for Sonny and Sal . I don't like being manipulated . It's this lack of ambiguity that stops DDA from being one of the best movies from the 1970s and I doubt if the real life characters would recognise themselves as the people in this movie and I feel too much artistic license has been taken with a bizarre true life story To be fair it's an entertaining and well made film . Sidney Lumet does as good a job here as he did in THE ANDERSON TAPES but it's the performances that really stand out .

            "content": "Dog Day Afternoon, in which Michael and Fredo Corleone rob a bank. Just a year after The Godfather: Part II Al Pacino and John Cazale are together again. This time they play two bank robbers, Sonny and Sal respectively, whose robbery does not go at all according to plan. With Pacino in the lead role casting Cazale was probably a mistake. For as great an actor as Cazale was when you see him with Pacino your mind can't help but go to Fredo. Again Pacino's the star while Cazale plays the quiet, somewhat dim-witted supporting figure. It's Fredo all over again and thinking about that takes you out of the experience of enjoying this movie. Then again there isn't necessarily all that much to enjoy here. The fact that Cazale's presence may lead you to think of the Godfather movies is not Dog Day Afternoon's biggest problem. This movie disappoints in other ways. Ultimately, despite a very good performance from Pacino, it proves to be quite a letdown.So the robbery goes horribly bad and Sonny and Sal find themselves trapped in the bank, surrounded by police, holding a bunch of unfortunate bank employees hostage. And then...nothing. Nothing much of consequence anyway. The movie plods along, incredibly slowly paced, rather devoid of drama. A crowd shows up, television broadcasts the unfolding events live and Sonny becomes an unwitting media star while Sal whimpers in the back of the bank. The story doesn't really move forward. Sonny and Sal are trapped...and they're still trapped...and they're still trapped...and can I get this two hours of my life back? There's a sense of inevitability to the whole thing. Once the situation has been established there are very few potential outcomes. This is all based on a true story but even if you know absolutely nothing about the real-life events it's not hard to guess how this is all going to turn out. Really the only twist in the tale comes when Sonny's wife shows up, revealing the motivation for the robbery. And well, that's quite a twist. So bizarre you wouldn't believe it if it weren't actually true. If it weren't true any screenwriter trying to pitch it would be laughed out of the room. If nothing else at least this provides for a bit of story and character development after all the time spent with Sonny staring at the cops and the cops staring at Sonny and absolutely nothing actually happening. Aside from the introduction of the wife the movie is a rather monotonous, predictable crawl towards the finish line. Pacino is very good but he doesn't have much material to work with. There's not much story here and what little story we have is hard to believe even if it is true. The robbery fails. The movie largely does too.",

            "content": "\"Dog Day Afternoon\" is a movie that works on several levels. As a thriller it is good. The tension in the movie is at times really notable and has a very realistic feeling. Also as a character study this movie works. Not that often do we get to see the side of- and sympathize for a bank robber in a movie. The character of Sonny Wortzik gets really deepens out in the movie and we get to see him from many different sides in the movie. That he also has an homosexual affair is really daring for the time when this movie was made but director Sidney Lumet doesn't make this a prominent element in the story and is just one of the sides of Sonny Wortzik. I think that is a really good approach towards the character which works really well for the movie. If it was made a big deal in the movie that Sonny had an homosexual affair, it would had only worked distracting from the main story and for the character as well. The fact that everything in the movie is also based on a true story only makes the movie more interesting.The movie sounds heavy but thank goodness it isn't. \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is a very fun movie that is filled with some comical situations and dialog, without making this movie look ridicules or entirely comical. It makes \"Dog Day Afternoon\" a light movie to watch, even though it still has some heavy moments in it of course. Therefor this is a movie that should be appealing and watchable for everyone.The movie is filled with a very realistic atmosphere- and camera-work by Victor J. Kemper. The movie has a gritty depressing like atmosphere which makes the movie its story work really well.There is no holding back Pacino! He puts lots of effort and passion in his character. It truly is one of his most memorable roles. I especially like the scene's between him and actor Charles Durning who plays Det. Sgt. Eugene Moretti, there is a certain thrust but also rivalry between them. John Cazale also plays one fine role but his role is rather limited. It was also fun to see Lance Henriksen in this movie, in one of his very first movie roles.Yet another perfect masterpiece from the golden age of American cinema; the '70's.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Coming from a school of thought who believe that Al Pacino is the god of acting, I began watching Dog Day Afternoon with a lot of expectations. Having now seen it 25 times (And counting), I must say that this movie has surpassed my expectation every time I've seen it. It has been my all time favorite movie for some time now.Dog Day Afternoon is a plot driven movie with superb characterization & is based on a real life story. It is essentially about two Vietnam War veterans, Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) & Sal (John Cazale) who have a lot of anti-establishment feeling within them. They disagree with the idea of working hard for a meager amount of money. Sonny is a bi-sexual who has a relationship outside his marriage & wants money for the sex change operation of his boyfriend. Both of them decide to rob New York bank in broad day light along with another colleague who backs out at the last moment. The bank robbery goes haywire as their haphazard ways to deal with the situation does not hold them in good stead. To start with, the bank is short of cash. The bank employees are also difficult to deal with. When the city police come to know about the robbery, they station themselves outside the bank, leading to a hostage situation. The movie unfolds into a negotiation between Sonny and the cops, & then between Sonny & FBI which is followed by a rescue operation. Sonny meanwhile, takes time out to slam the media which was following this operation, the cops & the whole establishment in general. He distributes some of the stolen money to the public around him, creates a scene around the bank and becomes a superstar of sorts for one day.Sonny is sharp & takes charge of the negotiations. He surprisingly gets along well with most of the hostages who also show some sympathy for him (A bit of Stockholm syndrome). Sal on the other hand is impassive, confused & does not take charge of the situation. The chemistry between Sonny & Sal is one of the highlights of the movie. However the biggest USP of the movie is Al Pacino's performance. It was clearly his best acting performance according to me. The 'Attica!!' scene, as well as the scene where Sonny has a conversation with his wife on the phone were phenomenal displays of his acting prowess. The whole Attica sequence makes me sit on the edge of my seat every time I watch this movie. John Cazale has also given a great performance. The movie is fast paced & eventful. Some of the scenes with the hostage (The bathroom scene for example) however are slightly over-dramatic. Finally, Sidney Lumet has done a wonderful job as a director in terms of characterization & to make the whole situation come alive. He evolved as a director from his last movie which was Serpico.In a nutshell I would say that it is one of the great movies of all time. Anyone who calls himself a movie buff, this movie is a must watch for him.",

The police are depicted as blind, cold and Machiavellian. It is the only movie I recall in which the gangsters seem to appear as victims.As it's happening in New-York at summer, it's a Brooklynian precursor of \"Do the right thing\" 10 years before.In conclusion, a must-see !",

Pacino plays an amateur bank robber who wants to use the stolen money to pay for his lover's (Chris Sarandon's) sex change operation. All goes wrong and the robbery becomes a media frenzy, and Pacino becomes a sort of hero, winning the sympathy of the crowd against the authorities. This anti-establishment story is so bizarre that it's no surprise that the film is based on true events. Truth is stranger than fiction, indeed.Pacino plays his character as a lovable, frenzied, desperate regular Joe, and our hearts go out to him. He's not a bad guy, but he's a guy who has made a lot of bad decisions and trapped himself in a corner. Charles Durning gives a fine performance as the chief of the police who develops some sympathy of his own for the hapless crook. And John Cazale, the poor perennially overlooked John Cazale, plays Pacino's right-hand man.Lumet directs with a fast, breathless pace. It's easy to see how his background in television work makes him a perfect choice to direct this kind of \"reality T.V.\" material. Indeed, as is the mark of many a classic film, the situations portrayed in \"Dog Day Afternoon\" could all too easily play themselves out for real today without much alteration.Grade: A+",

            "content": "Dog Day Afternoon is a film of surprises. At no point does it play out like you expect it to. I came to the film anticipating it was going to be good, but expecting it to be good as a hostage siege thriller, or a heist caper, or maybe a typically gritty 70s crime drama. It isn't any of those things. In fact, it's hard to categorise Dog Day Afternoon at all, because it so skilfully fuses a vast array of conventions and themes, resulting in a film that is endlessly watchable and hugely rewarding. If it sounds like I'm using a lot of superlatives here that's because I am; Dog Day Afternoon is one of the great films of American cinema. As great as Lumet's masterpiece, Twelve Angry Men, I hear you ask? I'd have to say yes; both films pretty much equal each other in their brilliance.On a hot August afternoon, a trio of men enter the First Savings Bank in Brooklyn and proceed to rob the place at gunpoint. During the early moments of the heist, young Stevie (Gary Springer) loses his nerve and bails out, leaving Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) to continue with their audacious raid. However, what should have been a lightning-fast robbery rapidly descends into a catalogue of errors. Firstly, the hapless robbers learn that there is almost no money in the bank as everything in the vault has already been collected. Then, Sonny attempts to burn some of the bank's paperwork only for the smoke to raise suspicions in the neighbouring businesses\u0085 and it isn't long before the police arrive. Before they know it, Sonny and Sal are surrounded by hundreds of heavily armed police officers and their plight looks utterly hopeless. With a handful of oddball bank staff as hostages, the robbers attempt to negotiate with Det. Sgt Moretti (Charles Durning). As the evening wears on, more and more curious onlookers come along to watch the event as it unfolds, many of them chanting their support for Sonny and Sal, especially when it becomes clear that Sonny only ever wanted the money to pay for his gay lover's sex change operation. What was meant to be a straightforward crime suddenly becomes a media circus, and the two men at the centre of it are swept helplessly towards their fate.Dog Day Afternoon is impressive on so many levels, but probably best of all is the acting. Pacino is mesmerising as Sonny. His semi-improvisational dialogue, his jittery body language and those incredibly expressive eyes combine to create a remarkable screen character. In fact, throughout the entire film the characterisation is richly detailed and wholly believable, and all the actors come off exceptionally well. Lumet gets across the immediacy of the situation brilliantly, with moments of tension, despair, folly, bravado and even some absurdist humour. It has a relatively thin plot when you stop to think about it, but very early on in Dog Day Afternoon the importance of the story is sacrificed in favour of detail and character and beautifully understated social commentary. The whole film is a joy to watch \u2013 edgy and exciting film-making at its finest. In a decade that saw some truly amazing films, here's one that can hold its place with the best of them.",

And, unsurprisingly, it turns out to be a top class production, one of those tough '70s classics that never grows old.This review will be short because I don't want to spoil any of the plot, except to say that this is the best bank robbery thriller ever made. The whole film is a huge set-piece full of fantastic actors giving excellent performances; of the ensemble, it's clear that Pacino is the best in the shouty, showy role, but John Cazale also excels as his somewhat depressed partner in crime. Watch out for Charles Durning, Lance Henriksen, Chris Sarandon, and James Broderick in smaller, but crucial roles.Of course, DOG DAY AFTERNOON isn't really a bank robbery film at all, instead a piece of left-wing social commentary exploring police tactics and brutality in the wake of the then-recent Attica prison massacre. Inevitably, the scenes with Pacino outside the bank are the highlights, but it all builds up to a truly gripping climax. This is a great film of its era that sits happily alongside the likes of THE GODFATHER, THE TAKING OF PELHAM 123, CHARLEY VARRICK and SERPICO as the best of its time.",

It's actually a very gripping tale and filmed just beautifully, and casted even better. Al Pacino of course is great, and even though he does walk a little close to the \"overacting\" line (a line he crosses throughout his entire career to some degree) he just stays safe here.Charles Durning was excellent as the head cop trying to keep things cool, and the scene with him and Pacino simply bickering back and forth is priceless. When the FBI take over at one point, he pretty much disappears for the rest of the movie and it's very noticeable.This was actually filmed just blocks from where I grew up in Brooklyn so that's another reason I always wanted to see it.

And \"Dog Day Afternoon\", while not a bad film, seems a bit odd to be ranked so high (although most Pacino fans would disagree).The movie is a telling of the true story of a man and his friend who rob a bank to try to get funds for a very just cause. I won't say what that cause is, because this is what makes the film really interesting. Al Pacino is the perfect bank robber. This should be no surprise, as Pacino is great in basically everything he does (\"Scent of a Woman\", \"Scarface\", \"Gigli\"). And pairing him with his \"Godfather\" co-star seems a logical choice.If you want an emotional film where you sympathize with the bank robber, this is your film. It's hard to be against Sonny (Pacino). At points, he even had the crowd and media outside the bank cheering him on.With all this praise, you're wondering why I doubt it's a Top 250 film. And the simple answer is pacing. This film takes place 99% of the time in a bank, in one room. Very little happens in this room. So, what we saw in 2 hours could have been trimmed to 90 minutes without really losing anything, in my opinion. There is a fine line between \"suspense\" and \"waiting around\". Also, this film has no music or background sound. That makes the pacing seem even slower than it already is.But it's still a good movie. And if you like Al Pacino, at some point you really must watch this movie because there's never going to be one like it again.

            "content": "\"Dog Day Afternoon\" is an American movie from 1975, so this one is heading closer to its 50th anniversary now and it is pretty much close to being called a crime classic. The director is Sidney Lumet and he was nominated for an Oscar here, one of the movie's six nominations. The only win was for the film's screenplay and I think that was really deserving because the only thing better in this amazing movie than the script is the performance by lead actor Al Pacino. I am tempted to say from what I have seen (and that includes both Godfather films), this one here is his career-best moment. He really nails it all, the loud moments, the quiet moments, he is always spot-on. A true all-time great performance if you ask me and what I wrote in the title of my review is certainly true. He is also playing along with the cast so nicely in this over 2-hour film. This includes the Godfather reunion of course with John Cazale whose character here is about as tragic as his real life unfortunately. There was one moment I found particularly sad, namely when we find out there is nobody for him to talk to before he dies or forever leaves the country. It is a really interesting character and even if he does not get the baity showy moments like the gay lover story line, there is still a lot under the surface for him. The violence, the aggression for example. He did not bond with the bank employees like Pacino's character, even if in the end he receives a little gift from one of the ladies. He is not an educated man, does not know about geography. He seems like a really religious person though and as a consequence also as a homophobe. He does not want to be seen and remembered as a homosexual. Cazale really does a lot with body language here. But all the other supporting characters are doing really fine too, down to the constantly chewing woman at the bank, the police officers and in the end the FBI guy who was really haunting. Or the police officer disguised as a taxi driver. It was pretty memorable how Sonny immediately saw through him when they were ready to let him drive. In general, Sonny was very smart and focused, knew exactly about everything and the things that went wrong and resulted in this mess were not caused by him. Like when they thought the car would bring all the money and not take it away. An accomplice failed there. Or when Sonny knows exactly that the bank employees should not take out all the money at the same time because of the alarm. Or what happens when the bank director uses the wrong key for the safe etc. Many examples there.With the gay transsexual lover, the film was heading into a fully different direction that I did not expect really and that I think I also did not like too much when I watched it the first time. But maybe it was just me. Now during rewatch I did not mind. I still think the Oscar nomination for Sarandon was a bit too much honestly. But good for them on touching delicately such an important subject. This can be extended to all the gay-themed moments in here really, no matter if we are talking about the homophobia outside the bank or, on the opposite side, the supporters. Also this film will really make you smile on many occasions without a doubt. One would be the bizarre horny guy calling the bank repeatedly. Now that was unexpected and wicked in a funny way haha. I really wonder who was behind that. More situational comedy that is also easily linked to the film as a whole can be seen in the ways how Sonny almost turns into a hero the way how he is treated outside. Just take a look at the pizza boy and his reaction. Epic stuff. Or when Sonny talks to his wife and mother. You could think that he stopped caring, especially for the former, but it's not true as we find out when he sets up his will and testament. But completely aside from that, it is also an amazing crime movie. The scene early on with the third really young robber may seem funny, but it is also a really memorable storytelling moment. And you can suck in the tension from inside the bank on your movie screen right from the beginning. And actually for the entire film really. Don't mistake this for really light material only because nobody (almost nobody) gets killed. It is also a thriller. And finally, it culminated in the taxi ride to the airport where it all ends then (We take care of Sal). I knew this time what would happen, obviously, but it was still as good as seeing this final scene for the first time. You will be amazed seeing these last 15-20 minutes. As you should be. Actually, you will be amazed by this film as a whole. One of the best 1970s films and Pacino is a contender for giving the best performance from all 1970s movies. Such range, such vitality, such energy. Just amazing. Absolutely don't miss out. There's no way you can watch the film and not be a fan afterwards. Go for it. Also you girls, don't mistake this for a guys movie. It is independent of gender, simply amazing film beauty. Highly, highly recommended.",

Part of this gritty realism is the amazingly \"colorful\" dialog. You'd never expect to hear this many f-words used in a film back in 1975. I didn't love this, but understand that real criminals in such a situation would probably not worry about offending people with their use of expletives--so I can't fault this either.While I often give longer reviews, there are frankly so many good reviews for this film already as well as synopses of the film--so I won't bore you with these details. Instead, I will point out that this largely improvised film worked well due to excellent direction and acting. I have no complaints at all but also didn't see the film as THAT exceptional.

But the 1970s were better. The raw chaos of the antinomian 60s was shaped and formed into structured narratives that were polished and disciplined. A number of great or nearly great film were produced, a surprising number of them dealing with criminal activity in one or another form -- \"The Godfather\", \"Chinatown,\" \"Serpico.\" \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is one of the best of them, the story of bisexual Al Pacino and his incredibly dim compadre John Cazale who are discovered while trying to hold up a bank in Brooklyn They take the bank's employees hostage and are undone while attempting their escape.There isn't a sour note in any of the performances, down to the atmosphere people. Charles Durning is the frustrated NYPD negotiator who shouts himself hoarse and is almost driven mad while trying to accommodate Pacino on the one hand and the demands of his superiors and the FBI on the other.Pacino is in top form as the fundamentally decent guy who is trying to get the money for his male wife's sex change operation, and Chris Sarandon is superb in the tough role of the male wife who now wants nothing to do with Pacino. Sarandon must walk a thin line between the suggestion of homosexuality and a parody of it, and he pulls it off perfectly in his speech and gestures. (His hands have long painted fingernails and he clutches his hospital robe close to his throat.) The phone conversation between Sarandon, in a barber shop, and Pacino in the bank across the street, is priceless. When Sarandon is first brought in, the barber shop is jammed with cops and FBI agents, and Durning is solemnly questioning Sarandon about the relationship. Sarandon confesses that he went to a psychiatrist who told him that he \"was a woman trapped in a man's body.\" At that, one of the cops in the background who has been trying to suppress a smile all along, snickers out loud, and Durning flicks him an angry glance out of the corners of his eyes for a few seconds. It's superbly done. An instant more of the glance would have been too much, and an instant less too little. Applause for the editor.Everything comes out just right. The ending is tragic but inevitable and perhaps even justified. The viewer is likely to become so wrapped up in the likable Pacino and his dilemmas that he forgets that Cazale has an automatic weapon and is entirely ready to kill with it.A marvelous job all around.",

But besides this, Al Pacino gives here one of his best performances, no problem. It will remain a classic movie for the history of world wide cinema.",

There's Al Pacino, a wonderful actor who has given some fine performances, and there's also Sidney Lumet, who directed 12 Angry Men and Network, which are brilliant movies. Dog Day Afternoon lived up to that and more, almost certainly one of the best heist movies out there. The script is excellent, the story is compelling even with some slow spots which I actually didn't mind and Lumet's direction is superb.The cinematography and editing are also top drawer and the sound is just great. I have little to criticise the acting about either, Al Pacino gives yet another wonderful performance that is also quite multi-layered, while John Cazale and Charles Dunning give fine support.All in all, an excellent film and some of the best work of a fine director and actor. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

There seems to be a little Stockholm Syndrome going on where the hostages begin to identify with their captors, but this isn't explored too closely. All the performances are very good with Pacino doing some of his very best scenery chewing with Cazale consequently playing it down and very understated (I liked that). It didn't work for me though because I never bought into the stories we learn about Sonny; it's him the film concentrates on mostly. He seems quite savvy when it comes to banks and police/FBI procedures and yet still panics when the police first arrive. I never had any connection with for either of the robbers and so found it quite a bumpy road to go down. Having said that I thought it was well made but certain scenes came across like a bit of an improvised scene in an acting class. I doubt I'd watch it again, but at least it's another I can cross off 'The List'.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (\u0085just)My score: 6.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",

When you hear that plot, you think comedy. Indeed, this movie is a black comedy, however, as we see in various scenes, it is also very serious. In fact, the tragic ending is a sober dose of real tragedy. Pacino makes this movie, he is that bankrobber, way over his head, trying in vain to make everything work out in the end.

The storyline follows a group of associates who planned a robbery in New York City one hot summer day. Unfortunately for them nothing goes as planned and the police quickly swarm in and surround the bank. As they negotiate their way out of this circumstance they leverage historical bank robberies mismanaged by police to get what they want; meanwhile, details about the robbers circulate the airways complicating matters.This movie is directed by Sidney Lumet (12 Angry Men) and stars Al Pacino (Scarface), John Cazale (The Godfather), Penelope Allen (The Thin Red Line), Sully Boyar (Car Wash), Carol Kane (Scrooged), Lance Henriksen (Pumpkinhead) and Charles Durning (The Sting).This movie is so well done and contains a unique storyline with incredible twists and turns. The characters are fascinating and unpredictable. The cast delivers tremendous performances and Pacino is awesome. You can see how his characters gets lost in the both the notoriety he receives but also in what to do next. The settings, heat and circumstances are perfectly depicted. The feel of the era and pressure on those involved is perfectly on display and the outcome is in doubt all the way until the final scene...you know it isn't going to happen the way Pacino wants, but you don't know what is going to happen.Overall, this is American cinematic gold from this era and an absolute must see.

            "content": "I've watched this film for the third time in a few years last night. Instead of writing a straight review, I'd like to jot down ten thoughts just off the top of my head concerning this exquisite movie:1) Watching this film will change forever your perception of the bank heist genre, making you question the contrived cinematic conventions these films usually make use of.2) The source of this film's paradoxical and/or farcical elements spring from life itself, not from film or pre-existing cinematic conventions. Sometimes, the absurdities of life are so great, they dwarf those included in any form of fiction. Without even trying to make that point, this film captures that concept beautifully.3) Its tone in relation to the homosexual theme is ahead of its time. In fact it's ahead of OUR time, even, in hardly making an issue out of it at all - it just IS.4) It captures the climate of the 70s in a manner so sober, you'll remember its unshowy yet authentic feel forever.5) Lumet's film brings to life the concept of the distorting lens of the media and how different groups with different agendas will turn an outlaw into a hero, with far more efficiency than Oliver Stone's brash, bloated, childish and repetitive Natural Born Killers.6) Watching this film will illustrate to the younger generations exactly why Al Pacino has earned himself the legendary status he probably no longer would deserve with his performances of the last 10 years alone. **SPOILERS**: Just watch those last ten minutes of him handcuffed against the bonnet of a car, where he doesn't say a word, but speaks volumes with his eyes and his soul just oozing out of every frame at the end of the movie; you'll remember those eyes for as long as you live!7) Watching this film, you'll realise that firing a gun-shot is a BIG DEAL in real life, and that other films make too much use of gun fire in a highly contrived way.8) All that tension deriving from pointed guns unable to fire a shot OR move away you realise Tarantino must've taken notes sometime along the way.9) No genre is old or done too many times before if it's handled with this amount of freshness, inspiration and talent.10) Watching Dog Day Afternoon for the third time has filled me with the same amount of wonder at the power of truly inspired but unobtrusive film-making as it did first time round.",

I kind of knew everything that was going to happen so it just seemed predictable that way. I guess maybe it is possible that people long ago told me the best parts of the movie and I forgot about it but knew it was going to happen once I started watching the movie.

It allowed room for moving drama, so-surreal-it-could-only-happen-in-real-life comedy, and quite a bit of suspense.

Despite claiming to be the film expert that I am, I had little knowledge of what the film is actually about.Sonny and Sal (that's Pacino and John Cazale) and some other guy enter a bank in Brooklyn with the intention of robbing it. But they simply couldn't be less prepared. One second into the robbery the third robber chickens out and runs away, leaving Sonny and Sal to do it on their own. The staff are jaded and cynical but politely put up with their bumbling and are only too happy to see the back of them. But the police surround the building at the last minute and a hostage situation suddenly arouses.With nowhere to go Sonny can only make the usual demands but the media circus outside makes him a nationwide star and the crowds outside cheer for him whenever he makes an appearance at the doors. I guess that in the 70's (a decade I never witnessed) public morale was so low that a failed bank robber could actually be a kind of hero for even attempting to stick it to the man.Based on a true story, the dialogue is mostly improvised, giving it a raw, realistic feel. Despite this, the script still won an Academy Award. A young Al Pacino seems to disappear and you end up seeing him only as Sonny. Why he never won the Oscar for Best Actor that year is beyond me. But I guess they thought that Jack Nicholson as McMurphy was more iconic/important/worthy or whatever. In fact, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest took almost all the Oscar's DDA was nominated for. Having never seen that film, I can't really judge if it deserved them. It was also competing with Jaws for Best Picture that year. Man, 1975 sure was a good year for movies. Something that simply cannot be said for any year in the past decade.One my favorite actors (Lance Henriksen, the man with the coolest voice in the world) has a small role as one of the FBI Agents. I never spotted him for a while (he's still quite young in this) and he has very little dialogue, but it still a pivotal role.It's hard to define the genre that DDA fits into. On the one hand it's a hard-hitting real-life drama but on the other it's a satirical black comedy that's not without several moments of laugh-out-loud humor. Not a film for action junkies, I assume this is more for film buffs of students more than anyone else, but it's certainly an important film and it marks one of the many turning points in Pacino's never-ending career.",

Heist movies tend to run the risk of being predictable and formulaic and even though one can expect the outcome of 'Dog Day Afternoon' to not be a happy ending, it's pretty much what goes on in the bank to what's happening right outside that sets it apart. Based on a true story, this movie just goes to show that fact can be weirder than any fiction.Lumet wonderfully balances comedy, drama, irony, intensity and suspense. He actually merges them in such a way that it enriches the experience for the viewer. There are plenty of twists. The movie opens with a few glimpse of summer in New York city and then it quickly switches to Sonny and Sal taking over the bank. The reaction of the hostages is one of the most amusing sequences. At first they are in shock but this gradually follows with excitement. The hostages later on enjoy the attention.The theme of homosexuality is also introduced in a subtle way. Thankfully, it's not presented as an issue, it's just there. The relationship between Sonny and Leon is just like any other souring urban relationship.Al Pacino delivers yet another outstanding performances that easily ranks among his finest works. There are several sequences where he displays his gift through sheer raw acting. A restrained John Cazale is equally remarkable. The way he conveys fear through his eyes gives the viewer a sense that he might explode at any time or have a nervous breakdown (and he probably may have had the standoff proceeded any longer). The rest of the cast, especially the actors who play the hostages, are brilliant.Lumet and Pacino had done it again. Easily, 'Dog Day Afternoon' is one of the best heist movies (if not THE best).

There is an ambiguity over just what is motivating Cazale's character, and this makes him a very interesting element. In contrast, the film explores the character played by Pacino quite well, so that one can understand and sympathise with his motivations. Both are therefore interesting elements. Another factor of interest is the contrasts in intensity that Lumet sets up. Outside the bank it is heated and intense while inside it is generally cool and calm. The film touches on many different ideas, such as trauma for Vietnam vets, police tactics, the media and homosexuality, but unfortunately none of these are explored too well, which leaves the film with little to say. Still, it is generally gripping, or at least until towards the end when it starts to become repetitive, too talkative and at times too much like a shouting match in which one can easily tune out. Maybe the two-hour length is the problem? It is slightly more than what is needed by the film to get through the material. But even if it is flawed, this is still something quite remarkable, and one of the best from 1975.",

            "review_title": "Confused and alienated youths going some way to produce a dog's dinner of a robbery, in what is a brilliantly executed drama piece.",
            "content": "Dog Day Afternoon begins with a montage presented to us in a relatively upbeat fashion, a going over and presenting of tidbits of New York-set summer iconography as people enjoy tennis matches; time on a beach and young lovers' company with one another. The music is uplifting and upbeat, the weather warm and welcoming as various people of whom have dressed down to coincide with the climate totter about the streets and parks. The soundtrack is meaningfully toned down when we come to focus on the American flag, itself being lowered from a pole, before cutting to a car housing some shifty looking individuals outside a bank: the iconographic, or 'romantisised', view of the city comes to a bit of crashing halt as we zone in on a new band of youths of whom do not conform to the various groups of kids and youths most certainly on display in the 'outsider' montage. The flag's physical lowering is systematic with the film's own lowering into a part of New York the tourists don't see, and their clicking off of the radio thus killing the song we were actually hearing, is the ultimate act that confirms both their and this New York existence's presence.Dog Day Afternoon has this attitude towards New York and its inhabitants, keeping a distanced perspective of more typical New York City imagery and instead focusing on those inhabiting the undergrowth within; those with issues, problems, flaws and feelings as the actions and consequents of those that undertake the desperate deeds are observed. \"The robbery should have taken 10 minutes. 4 hours later, the bank was like a circus sideshow. 8 hours later, it was the hottest thing on live T.V. 12 hours later, it was all history. And it's all true\" reads the film's tag-line; its 'hook', if you will. Not knowing a thing about the true-to-life events the 1975 released Best Picture nominee is based on may have added an extra layer of dramatic effect, but I've a feeling the film would work just as effectively with the knowledge of said events in mind.The film sees Al Pacino's Sonny Wortzik and John Cazale's Sal hole up in a bank much in the same way a certain John Wojtowicz did in reality with his accomplice Salvatore Naturile, on whose exploits the film is based. Of all the physical things wrong with what they do in conjunction with the robbery, the oral mentioning of their names out loud is probably the worst of the early stages; Sonny's general incompetence masked by Sal's real inability, we feel, to deal with what he's got himself involved in, and consequently coming across as more attributed to the scenario than he actually is. Sonny takes charge of the situation when the preplanned three of them is reduced to two after the bailing of an additional robber, Sonny does the talking and thinking as Sal inherits the characteristics of the sub-machine gun he wields: a short, small and sinister looking individual whom does very little and feels just as concealed from the action. You get the additional sense he could do some serious, rapid and biting damage if provoked. As one thing leads to another, a large crowd gathers outside and soon police negotiators representing their true-to-life incarnations, with altered names, are doing their utmost to defuse the situation.If Lumet is presenting the inhabitants of New York in his opening montage as the average, every-day New York City dwelling every-men as youngsters enjoys sports and one another's company; then the zoning in on the car of bank robbing youths might be seen as a marginalisation of said inhabitants as the disconnection they have from everyone else is made aware: their chosen activity is anything but of the populist or indeed legal variety. But rather than marginalise, or demonise, these people as nothing more than petty thieves or, as it transpires through one means or another, emotionally confused freaks involved in bizarre extramarital affairs; the film chooses to explore their plight and, crucially, if we are to compare them to the match-made youths in the opening montage, their straining relationships with wives and partners.While the true aims of why it is they are after such a large stash of money are more humbling than those of what most other thieves might have done it for, Lumet's film does not excuse the perpetrators of this crime, nor does it glamorise or idolise the characters. Instead broadening the study into a sort of collective struggle blended in with some other youngsters of the day: youths confused and alienated with both the system and authoritarian figures in general, in a nation whose government is supposedly corrupt-to-the-core given the shadow of Watergate still looming large, and whom were expected to go off and die in Vietnam on demand for phony ideologies of said government. The attention seeking, disillusioned youngsters that gather around the bank when the media circus kicks off sees many-a youngster heckle the police officers guarding the area and often crave meek fame for having seen around an event such as this, offering somewhat gleeful reactions to the result of being on display in front of a television camera and an (in)consequental few seconds of fame when they are not feeling as if they've achieved something by simply delivering a pizza to the crime scene. The film is rich in drama, the stand offs between Sonny and the police officers pushed right to the brink of which of the two sides might come out on top, and Lumet inches out as much heightened tension as possible in a film that is thoroughly worthwhile in its explorations and detailing.",

            "content": "What Sonny and Sal thought would be a quick bank robbery turns into something more-- that's the premise of \"Dog Day Afternoon.\" At the same time, however, a film that convinces you that it falls somewhere within the lines of conventional crime drama, also turns into something much greater and infinitely more meaningful than that. It takes you deep into the psyche of a desperate man turned criminal and simultaneously broadens the scope to critique society.You can pretty much tell from the start that Sonny (Pacino) is not a run-of-the-mill bank robber. He knows a lot about banks, but he has a nervous, frenetic energy about him. The film wisely dives straight into the robbery, not setting us up to know any of Sonny's motivation, which is slowly revealed and even then not clearly understood over the course of two hours. The writing is so terrific in the way that it starts with a small event but then expands and becomes richer through small, dialogue-heavy scenes. \"Afternoon\" sort of has the soul of a work for the stage in that sense, which makes it unique immediately.Sidney Lumet is just an absolute master of the craft. Much like in \"12 Angry Men,\" he uses strategic camera-work to convey time, intensity and pressure. He wants to get you sweating like the characters, unsure of what might happen next and paranoid about it. You wait for something to go horribly wrong, yet instead you are subjected to learning about the interesting lifestyle and behavior of Sonny.\"Afternoon\" in a sense becomes both an individual and group psychological study of a particular situation in which there is a very clear conflict with very clear implications. From the cops negotiating outside the bank to the ladies trying to pass the time inside, the circumstances of the event have a definite bearing on the characters and also our experience of the film.It's not a traditional film involving a bank robbery and that's easily the best part of this film. It is more than just the mystere surrounding bank robberies. Instead of painting a cool portrait of a professional criminal, it jumps into the mind of an average person who might actually commit a random crime to get money. Instead of nearing its climax with some sort of police break in and fight, it takes a much more reasonable turn. At the very least, \"Afternoon\" deserves respect for being a great film despite un-fulfilling our Hollywood bank robbery fantasies.",

            "content": "Dog Day Afternoon is probably one of the best paced and most gracefully aged movies from the 1970s. It focuses on a true story about a bank robbery that happened in New York City, and is consistently tense and engaging throughout almost all of its runtime.Al Pacino is phenomenal here. I was wondering how he didn't win an Oscar for his performance here, but then remembered this came out the same year that Jack Nicholson won for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, which is admittedly another legendarily great performance. 1975 was just a particularly strong year for American movies (Jaws also came out that year).I love the way this movie's shot and also how authentic it feels. On top of being a great movie about a bank robbery, it also looks at the media's role in the whole story, and touches upon some LGBT themes in a way that makes the film feel ahead of its time. The way it tackles those themes still feels grounded and respectful, and it must have been groundbreaking for 1970s standards.I think there are a couple of moments that feel a little slow in the second half, which may be a consequence of having the core story kick off so quickly - I do otherwise love how that happens, which much of the character development happening whilst the situation is unfolding, rather than showing it all before the main event. It's just a great movie all around, features one of Pacino's best performances, and is also among the best films from director Sidney Lumet.",

His portrayal of a jittery bank robber who becomes overwhelmed by the pressure his stunt generates is simply magnificent. There are not enough superlatives in the English language to describe it, but here's one more: Masterful.   His performance reels you into the film and never lets you go for the entire running time.  It has to be said that some of the credit for this must go to the great script he was given, but it was truly a tour de force from the great man.  He is entertaining whether in scenery chewing mode (\"Devils Advocate\", occasionally here when the script calls for it) or oozing brooding intensity (\"Donnie Brasco\", \"The Godfather's\")  Eminently watchable.   I hate to turn this review into a gushing Pacino love-fest, but honestly, the film wouldn't be the true classic it's known as without him.  Great film maybe, Classic?  No, Pacino elevates it to that level.   An object lesson as to how one man's performance can energise an entire film.  Don't believe me?  Think of the film without Pacino at its hub and tell me that that particular finished product wouldn't be much the poorer film.  Go on, I dare you...!",

            "content": "For me, this movie represents everything that was magical about 70s American cinema: good direction, acting, and writing mixed with social awareness and a finely tuned, engaging narrative plot. Before studios learned the wrong lesson from Star Wars and decided that special effects blockbusters were the way to go (not totally incorrectly), American movies managed to have their cake and eat it too, as far as entertainment value AND thought were concerned.The story is of a botched robbery involving Sonny (Al Pacino) and the shady, quiet Sal (John Cazale), an event already gripping but increased by the pervading influence of media and mob mentality, counter-cultural undertones rumbling through the streets and alternative sexuality, friendly hostages, pizza deliverers and cab drivers. By all means, what sets this movie apart from any other heist movie is the crowd, which acts almost as a Greek chorus inciting the drama of the plot as they simultaneously cheer for Sonny as a hero for the under-represented and heckle the cops for representing the authority. Under the PR knowledge that the cops can't shoot Sonny or risk a scene reminiscent of Attica, and they can't very well arrest him while Sal is inside the bank, slowly getting more distraught, instead the authorities are basically forced to give Sonny the stage to figure out his life and rant at society as a whole.Danger is always vibrating beneath the surface of every scene, building like an escalating earthquake, but Dog Day Afternoon is most often remembered for Sonny's cries of \"Attica! Attica!\", a similar quotation in ways to Network's \"I'm ****ed off and I'm not going to take it anymore!\" in expressing the sentiment of the time. This movie is almost a cathartic response to the social situation of the time, except of course for the main narrative concerns involving the robbery proper and the ultimate justice that the audience (nor the diagetic crowd) want to recognize: that this is not going to end well.In other words, its a classic of cinema from a time when making classics meant something and making a point was often respected and listened to. There are always closed-minded people out there who thumb their noses at anything they deem to be \"old movies\", which essentially means any movie that came out before Fight Club (and even now that movie's starting to fall into the obscurity of \"my parents liked it so it must not be good\"), but for basically everyone else in the world, this is a pretty essential classic that shouldn't be missed.--PolarisDiB",

If you notice, there are only really a few excellent and terrific movies from the decade: The Godfather, Jaws, The Exorcist, The French Connection, Blazing Sadles, Young Frankenstein, Star Wars, etc.In my film appreciation book, it mentioned \"Dog Day Afternoon\", my sister had the movie and I asked if it was good, she said that if I didn't like this, I have no appreciation for movies what-so-ever. To me, the cover didn't look anything special. Al Pacino, yeah, he's a great actor, but does that make a good movie? I was so wrong about \"Dog Day Afternoon\", it was a great movie. Al Pacino, why didn't he win the Oscar? It also is amazing what they showed intense and some very hush-hush topics of the 70's: homosexuality, media attention, and the anti-hero. The funny thing is, you want to love Al Pacino's character, even though, yes, he's robbing a bank, he doesn't hurt anyone. He even makes that clear that he just wants money for a situation he has with his boyfriend. Although I was a little disappointed with the ending, I felt as if it was cut too short and if you see it, you'll understand why I was very angry with the way Sal's character was dealt with. I'm sure that there are a few agreements with those who have also seen the movie. Still, I will highly recommend this movie for film fanatics. It's a great one!10/10",

Something about the 70s and 80s man... just makes a movie better. I try not to let the decade a film is released affect my opinion on it, but I just can't help it for 70s/80s. The aesthetic and setting of them are strangely nostalgic (even though I was born in 2004). Other than that, I thought this film was great, apart from some of the scenes that really dragged.

            "content": "Film adaptations of true events will inevitably get slammed from some quarters. In the case of Dog Day Afternoon it was attacked by its own lead subject John Wojtowicz (renamed Sonny Wortzik for the screen), who described it as \"only 30% accurate\". His gripes were mainly about portrayals of secondary characters such as his mother and first wife, as well as his belief that the film implies he sold out Sal \u2013 which it doesn't. But such is the nature of cinema \u2013 reality is a myriad of single events from a myriad of perspectives, without explicit beginnings, endings or crescendos. A movie, on the other hand, must tell a story.And movies have to take a form. Dog Day Afternoon, oddly enough, often takes the form of a comedy. Whether this comes more from Frank Pierson's script or the many improvisations made during rehearsal I don't know, but either way it seems to originate from very absurdity of the situation. Although it's based on true events, it's like a \"what if?\" sketch. What if a na\u00efve and essentially nice guy tries to pull off a bank robbery? You get situations like the robber asking the hostages if they need the bathroom. And of course, as any Charlie Chaplin fan knows, a comedy basis makes serious scenes even more poignant.This is why Al Pacino's performance is so vital. Far more animated than he was in the Godfather movies, he displays both a knack for comic timing, deepened by the touching simplicity of his character. John Cazale too is almost childlike, speaking tough but acting timid, and this is by far the best of his half-dozen film roles. Chris Sarandon gives a sublimely naturalistic performance, for what is definitely a difficult part to get right. Penelope Allen is also excellent, full of the gutsy personality that makes her the key to the fraternization between the robbers and the hostages. Above all it's the sheer likability of these players as they present themselves here that enables us to laugh, cry, and be enthralled by their antics.Dog Day Afternoon is at least faithful enough to real events that it mixes the public with the personal. After all, the real Sonny was not just some money-hungry hoodlum, and it was essential to balance the FBI operation and the media circus with the character's background and humanity. Who better to handle this balance than director Sidney Lumet. Lumet was already something of a specialist in movies confined to single locations (12 Angry Men, Murder on the Orient Express), and the way he approached these problems was to create different kinds of space within the limitations of the set. In Dog Day Afternoon we have everything from the grand scale outdoor shots, to simple group mid-shots, to the intimacy of the close-up. But there is far more variation going on here than simply how far the camera is from the action. There are, for example, close-ups which don't feel entirely private, with other characters seen in the background, and those which are totally personal, against plain backgrounds with no movement other than that of the actors being focused on. Even in some of the outdoor shots Lumet sometimes arranges things so that those thronging crowds are cut out of the shot. The greatest moment of genius is perhaps the conversation between Pacino and Sarandon. It begins with Sarandon amid loads of cops, and he is awkward and stilted. However as he eases up and the conversation becomes more personal, so too does the space around Sarandon. Sarandon has not gained privacy, but he has forgotten that he doesn't have it.On a purely cinematic level, Dog Day Afternoon is a masterpiece. And yes, some small details had to be changed to make it that good a piece of storytelling. It is not a documentary. And as such a great work, the film has been loved by millions. We come away from it with the feeling that Sonny and his associates were misfits rather than villains, good in their intentions if misguided in their actions, and that the events of that day were a kind of social tragedy. John Wojtowicz, the real Sonny, could hardly have asked for a better tribute.",

            "content": "\"Dog Day Afternoon\" is an example of how a simple story can make a movie.Although the entire movie is about a bank robbery in Brooklyn (in the year of 1972) and despite almost the whole movie taking place inside a bank, it is involving and entertaining. This is a crime movie which is also a thriller. Besides, it is thrilling, intense, very energetic, dramatic and full of tension. There's also lots of language, particularly the \"F\" word. The movie is often hilarious in many ways too. It has very funny lines and comical moments, such as when Sal thinks that Wyoming is a country. Even the most tense and intense sequences full of screams are made in a hilarious way. The title makes perfect sense: it really is a dog day afternoon for everyone in the whole story.Solid performances by the actors is another strength. A young Al Pacino gives an extremely energetic and amazing performance as Sonny Wortzik, the leader of the bank robbery. John Cazale doesn't talk much but he is excellent as Sonny's crime partner Sal. A funny fact is that the actor who plays Sheldon (James Broderick) looks like George W. Bush. Charles Durning plays Detective Moretti, another interesting character.Sonny is one of the most interesting robber characters ever. Although he is a criminal, he's actually quite kind to the hostages (despite his use of language): he gives them what they need when they need something and he helps them when they need help in something. And his screams are incredible, as well as his funny facial expressions and his lines. We end up liking him. Sonny also makes a reference to the Attica scandal. He even calls \"squirrel\" to one of the women in the bank.Aside the opening song \"Amoreena\" by Elton John, there is no soundtrack at all in this film. Also, the opening credits have little to do with the rest of the movie. They show lots of places and activities in New York city, probably to show that the story takes place in a hot Summer day (a dog day afternoon).The best Al Pacino's movie I've seen so far and clearly better than the 1997 remake \"Mad City\" with John Travolta and Dustin Hoffman.",

            "review_title": "A fascinating study of criminal behaviour, police action and reaction and media invasion; \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is the epitome of the crime genre",
            "content": "One of the three primary themes of Dog Day Afternoon is a study of criminal behaviour. Taking Sonny Wortzik (performed exquisitely by Al Pacino), the protagonist and lead character involved in the bank robbery of the plot, as the sole representation of the 'criminal' \u2013 the crime follows conventions that apply to reality more so than film in general; plan, operation, getaway \u2013 the film skips plan, heads straight for operation and gets stuck before getaway; with the events occurring unbeknownst to the characters' expectations, despite their ability. Sonny is not a clich\u00e9 \u2013 a character motivated by greed and ruthless compassion but rather a man with an understanding of the system and his place in it \u2013 that being he needs to bark attention his way to be a part of it, or at least, get a share, if not fair. The main factor is how common morality affects the criminal sense of communication and compromise in order for a successful operation. This is demonstrated by the key art of intimidation they need to force upon the civilians in order to get what they want, except in this film, many issues interrupt their threatening attempts such as the hostages needing to go to the bathroom and Sonny with his accomplice Sal (played by an edgy John Cazale, an actor of which could be considered to have the greatest filmography of all-time) obliging to these miniscule demands. One of the first ideas presented are acts of bravery; contrasting the criminal with the hostage, during the first few moments of the robbery one of the accomplices (of which we never see again) chooses to coward out \u2013 in doing so, he appears to lose all rational thought and makes illogical decisions whilst the bank manager remains calm and follows procedure. By giving this initial impression, it enhances all the pressures that later take place. There's even an instance in which Sal sharply threatens the hostages and gets taken aback by their screams. Even though there is a prominence of the artillery in the film with both the criminals and police, rarely being a scene without one \u2013 two shots in total are fired; both having significant impact among everyone.The iconic scene and most important quote in Dog Day Afternoon is Pacino screaming \"Attica\" in the street. This scene pretty much sums up everything the film stands for as Sonny riles up the crowd. But mostly a study of police reaction and action involving co-operation \u2013 as in Attica, of which was a real event, police killed 42 guilty and innocent people. Sonny understands their routine and how much they value a crime \u2013 and due to how much he knows, he refuses to trust them even more, especially the chance of unpredictability within their compromises \u2013 expertly contrasted with the compromises Sonny and Sal make with the hostages in the bank, concerning their safety. Blending the images with a montage of footage between the police and criminals, it's revealed that their motives are not too different, in an effort for credibility. There are two representative figures of the police; Moretti (Charles Durning) and Sheldon (James Broderick) \u2013 both of which use methods of intimidation much like Sonny and Sal; even coming to a point where Sonny recognizes the limits the police will go since the event has an audience he can abuse and alter their intentions; such as using no weapons to get some officers to move back. The entire power Sonny has gained is entirely blamed on the police \u2013 and this frustrates the police during their negotiation. It proposes the suggestion that irrational behaviour is only acceptable within the system, ignoring emotional disposition whilst doing everything to retain a sense, even if false, of professionalism and control.Media plays the most important part as to why these events are significant \u2013 or enough to base a film on it. If it weren't for the media, these events would be irrelevant. The media completely invades the situation. In the second act, there's a subplot that centres completely on Sonny and his personal life \u2013 involving both his spouses; one a man and one a woman. This bisexuality allows the media to blow the discovery completely out of proportion, making the crime seem motivated by this preference \u2013 to the point where they claim that there are two homosexuals robbing the bank (Sal of course, resents this statement) which has the consequence of gaining a crowd of gay rights activists, almost with the idea that Sonny's criminal action is stimulated by this (as the chant \"out of the closets and into the streets\" comes from). The media considers these proceedings as nothing more than entertainment, without a care of whom or what gets hurt just as long as it gets ratings \u2013 even prompting Sonny to go ahead and kill the hostages. It's even demonstrated in how the paparazzi immediately and physically intervene, trying to grasp full on interviews as soon as possible. This is also expanded as to how the public \u2013 or the live audience \u2013 reacts to Sonny and his actions, celebrating and encouraging him, especially in a scene where he throws some money out to the crowd, almost completely making his bank robbery attempt seem utterly pointless. Also, aside from Sonny, every character that gets the slightest bit of attention gets a sense of euphoria and feels impressed with them for no real reason. And again, it's all the media's fault \u2013 and this applies to real-life situations as shown by how the news mentions negative stories far more regularly than positive ones; or at least, as the clich\u00e9 suggests.10/10",

The result is a drama that's utterly engrossing as well as being funny, tense and unpredictable. It's also, however, a character study of its complex main protagonist and a commentary on various aspects of public and media behaviour that also have the potential to affect the course of the events that they're watching.On a hot summer afternoon in New York City, gang leader Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and his accomplices Sal (John Cazale) and Stevie (Gary Springer) enter the \"First Brooklyn Bank\" just before closing time with the intention of robbing the place. Almost immediately, Stevie gets cold feet and leaves and Sonny and Sal hold the bank staff at gunpoint as they put their plan into action. They realise they've made a big mistake when they discover that there's very little cash in the vault and as a consolation, steal some travellers' cheques instead. Sonny, who had previously worked in a bank, knew that to cover their tracks, they'd need to destroy the bank's register and so he burns the documents in a waste-bin behind one of the counters. When people across the street see smoke escaping through a vent, the authorities get notified and the entire area is rapidly swamped with 250 armed cops, a street full of police cars and a police helicopter patrolling overhead. Everyone in the bank quickly realises that they've been propelled into a siege situation and Sonny receives a phone call from Detective Sergeant Moretti (Charles Durning) who attempts to bring the incident to a swift and peaceful conclusion.Sonny starts to feel pressured by being responsible for his nine hostages and trying to devise a way to escape his predicament without any assistance from Sal who's not-too-bright at the best of times. Sonny readily releases the bank's asthmatic security guard when Moretti asks for a hostage to be released as a sign of good faith and tries to be attentive to the needs of his other hostages. Events escalate further when a large crowd gathers outside and the whole proceedings start to be transmitted live on TV. The crowd become sympathetic to Sonny and cheer when he comes out to negotiate with Moretti and he also becomes a media star after being interviewed on TV.As the siege continues, it's revealed that Sonny is unemployed, divorced from the woman he married and attempted the bank robbery to pay for the gender-reassignment surgery that his current \"wife\" Leon (Chris Sarandon) is planning to undergo. He also promises that more hostages will be released if a plane can be provided to take him and Sal out of the country. The police agree to this demand but the tone of the negotiations changes markedly when Moretti stands aside for the FBI to take the lead in what follows.As a study of human behaviour, this movie anticipates the popularity of reality TV shows, illustrates to how people respond to anyone (even a loser) who can work a crowd and illustrates how fickle public support can be by some of the chants that are directed at Sonny after it becomes known that he's bisexual.This low budget \"truth is stranger than fiction\" tale is graced by consistently good performances from its entire cast and understandably became a huge box office success because of its offbeat story, its relatable characters and the sheer intensity that Al Pacino brought to his memorable portrayal of a basically decent guy who makes some very stupid decisions. The whole production is also brilliantly directed in a way that's unobtrusive and skilfully changes the atmosphere whenever the need arises.",

Dog Day Afternoon is one of the classic bank robbery movies, so if you do love this genre, you're going to want to make sure you've seen it. It's sure to satisfy all the men in the audience, and the ladies who love Al Pacino's gorgeous, feathery hairstyle.While I was amused, decades after this movie's release, to see all the bits that are now famous-the gift-wrapped guns, \"Attica,\" among others-I can imagine the tension felt while sitting in the theaters in 1975 as Al Pacino and John Cazele hold hostages inside the bank and their plans start unraveling. There's a reason this movie has become one of the standards all other heist movies are measured against: it's good. There's tension galore as the wild, emotional star of the '70s has to improvise to try and get away with his terrible crime, so perch yourself on the edge of your seat and don't get up for more popcorn.",

            "content": "Al Pacino never had a role as tailor-made to his gift for over-the-top, on-the-edge histrionics than he did in \"Dog Day Afternoon.\" His Sonny is unique for the way he mixes comedy and pathos, screaming profanity one moment, quietly sympathetic and almost soulfully gentle the next. \"I speak what I feel,\" he tells a teller who asks him to watch his language, but he's obviously sensitive to what people think of him, even when he's pointing a gun at them.\"Dog Day Afternoon\" is really Pacino's baby. The film exists to serve his art. The fact he's great in it is almost incidental. Of course he's great in it, he's a great actor in a movie that puts all the focus on him. But how good is it otherwise?Pretty to very, depending on which part of the movie you are watching. The film is better at the outset and in the middle than in the end, where it gets sloppy in its emotions and reaches beyond the bank for its storyline, dulling the focus. The central premise, a holed-up duo of ne'er-do-wells taking on the city, works as underdog formula for a while, especially when Sonny faces down the police by screaming \"Attica\" and making them put their guns down. The bank employees are fleshed out nicely with the help of Sully Boyar as the bank's manager, Penny Allen as the head teller, Marcia Jean Kurtz as a gum-snapping teller, and Carol Kane as the \"squirrel\" who gets a call from her husband asking what he should do for dinner while she's a hostage.Pacino's \"Godfather\" mate John Cazale, in a velvet suit of fire engine red in case you were wondering what decade this was made in, is there as buddy Sal to provide steely backup as Sonny holds up the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. When John Cazale is the muscle man, your plot is definitely in trouble, and Sal and Sonny quickly find themselves surrounded by about four thousand members of New York's finest.The dialogue has a very improvisational feel to it, which along with the strong characterization and frequent humor gives \"Dog Day Afternoon\" much of its watchability. You really feel like you are seeing this botched robbery happen as it goes down, in real time.There's a nice use of suspense, too, the first time you watch it. Sonny's so out there that you never know what, if anything, will set him off in a homicidal rage. And you know Sal really wants to start dumping those bodies out the door. So even though you can count the number of gunshots in this movie with one hand (and have enough left over to snap your fingers with), you are nervous all the way through.It does feel like the New York Police Department are a little too much out in force; was August 22, 1972 a good day to commit a crime in one of the other four boroughs? The police and the FBI are seen as unreasonable heavies, but Vietnam veterans and homosexuals probably come off worse, not to mention former Goldwater campaign activists. As far as the gay thing goes, it comes across as a bit silly when we see a group of over-the-top drag queens show up at the police barricade to cheer on sister Sonny, but the phone conversation between Pacino and Chris Sarandon as his lover Leon is among the movie's most affecting scenes. Sarandon is really good at playing a total human mess who actually is a voice of relative reason in Sonny's world.Can't get over how young Pacino looks. He reminds me of Matthew Broderick in \"WarGames.\" Funny that one of the FBI agents here is played by Matthew's father. Matthew's father is in another classic '70s New York crime movie, \"The Taking Of Pelham One-Two-Three\" which has a similar feeling to \"Dog Day\" but a much heavier vibe. No question the 1970s were a great decade for crime dramas, and \"Dog Day\" is one of the best.",

He really needs to fire his agent right now so he can land himself better material than The Recruit and S1m0ne. While Dog Day Afternoon is very entertaining and well made, it does have some major problems. I think its depiction of gay characters, the ones besides Pacino's, that is, is dated if not offensive. It's almost like you can hear Lumet standing behind the camera telling Chris Surandon to \"queer it to the max!\" and \"get that wrist limper!\" You know he actually got an Oscar nomination for that?! The hostages are all over the map, too. Sometimes they're as scared as hell and sometimes they're having a ball. It's never consistent, not even within individual characters. There are a lot of interesting social issues raised, but the politics are a bit murky. Still, Pacino holds the film together so well that these things, even though they are pretty big flaws, seem small. I can't see how the Academy could choose Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest over Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon. The two films are about equal in value, but Pacino comes off as a full character.",

The story, based on the botched robbery concocted by John Wojtowicz, makes for one hell of a loose, shaggy, kinetic comic-tragedy, with Frank Pierson's screenplay winning an Oscar and Pacino and Lumet receiving nominations. Chris Sarandon (also Oscar nominated) has a small, heartfelt role as Pacino's suicidal lover, while John Cazale as Pacino's nervous partner and Charles Durning as the first cop on the scene are perhaps equally fine. The film isn't hard-shelled or raw; instead, Lumet brings Brooklyn alive, kicking and screaming, to form the heart of the piece, and the film is equal parts acerbic satire, sad commentary, and acute observation that is at times howlingly funny. ***1/2 from ****",

            "content": "Sidney Lumet directed the magnificent \"Dog Day Afternoon\" in 1975, but the story could be done just as is today and still be fresh. Thus is one mark of a classic. Al Pacino is Sonny, who along with his friend Sal (John Cazale) and another man brazenly walk into a bank and attempt to rob it. Here it's somewhat of a black comedy, because the third man decides he can't go through with it and leaves - but before he does, Sonny gets the car keys from him. We later learn that Sonny, a husband and father, is robbing the bank to get money for his other spouse, Leon (Chris Sarandon), who wants a sex change operation. Sonny is nice to the hostages. He doesn't lock them in the vault because there won't be enough air, he lets them go to the bathroom, he tells them to call home, he gets food brought in - and when one of the women has an opportunity to leave, she doesn't, nor does the lone man.This is first of all one of the world's loudest films that must have used as many extras as \"Cleopatra\" did. They line the Brooklyn street outside the bank yelling for Sonny, and later the crowds are joined by the gay community yelling \"Out of the closet and into the street!\" The harried police, who are having trouble figuring out this guy, are led by Charles Durning, with James Broderick (Matthew's dad) there for the FBI. It's an incredibly circus atmosphere, with helicopters flying overhead, television cameras, reporters, and police.Through it all there's Sonny and Sal, with Sonny hoping that Sal doesn't start shooting as he tries to figure a way out of the mess he's gotten himself into. Al Pacino gives a tour de force performance as Sonny, a man with an hysterical mother, an hysterical wife, and a lover in Bellevue who wants to get away from him. It felt as if much of the dialogue was improvised; it sounds very natural. Pacino's eyes tell a story, particularly at the very end of the film. When he was young, his eyes dominated his face, and they were mesmerizing.Chris Sarandon gives a terrific performance as Leon. Everyone is good, well directed by Lumet with a hand that gives the entire film authenticity. Look for Carol Kane was one of the hostages and \"The Sopranos\" Uncle Junior, Dominic Chianese, in a tiny role as Sonny's father.A must see, and a film that showcases Lumet's great talent and why Al Pacino is one of our greatest actors.",

            "content": "I've never seen this all the way through before. I've seen clips, but I've got the gist... right? Bank robbery goes wrong, based on a true story. Pacino chewing the scenery. Nope, there's a whole lot more going on here and as always with great films, it's the details that make them shine. We're in Brooklyn, New York in it's 1970s squalor. Summer heat, dirty streets, that undercurrent of slight desperation. Desperation that leads Sonny (Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) to walk into a bank in broad daylight, sporting classic cheap 70s suits, concealed guns and in Cazale's case an iconic haircut. They're in over their heads from the get go, the panic palpable even in the opening lines of dialogue. It's not supposed to be funny, but they're so shambolic it's hard not to chuckle a little. They're small time, nice guys really just doing something stupid for what turns out to be very little money. This is America though and some things don't change. How do you resolve a fairly minor criminal situation... yes, more guns! Enter the cops. All of em I think. If Sal wasn't jittery before, he is now. It's got a weird tone to it. Grimey and lo-fi, but with a bizarrely large cast, one that rallies with our two assailants, siding with the little guy oppressed by the gun crazy police authorities. But it's clear pretty quickly that it's much more than a mere stick up and more a commentary on haves, have nots, the role of the family, societal structure, celebrity culture. For what's essentially a bit part, Sal pulls focus whenever called upon. It's the Sonny show though and Pacino really does go all in, playing the trapped and troubled wannabe bank robber. That's just it though. He doesn't really want to be there at all and neither does Mulvaney (Charles Durning), the cop he's negotiating with. They both want it over, but Sonny does have a purpose. The money is for his husbands sex change. I really didn't expect that and it seems like a interesting role for Pacino in 1975 to go for following The Godfather and Serpico. He pulls it off though, the whole cast do, normalising the situation remarkably quickly, everyone keeping cool. Time is a weird thing in cinema. I often look at older films, the simplicity in the storytelling, in the production and wonder would it work as well today. Can modern filmmakers do this, or do we simply expect more, certainly in production values, but I think a modern take would bury it in grit, blood, serious drama. This is enjoyable entertainment. People are waving guns around, but it doesn't exactly feel dangerous. Again because it's much more than a heist movie. The hostages become friends of a kind. There's emotional depth, both in Sonny's reasoning for the robbery and in the way it plays out. It's hard to believe it's a true story or based on one and I certainly was well wide of the mark on my assumptions going in. It's great. You might want to take a shower after though, it's one of the sweatiest looking films I've watched in quite some time.",

This is certainly a new one for perpetrating bank robberies. I wonder what Bonnie and Clyde would have said?The robbery goes awry and quickly becomes a hostage situation.Carol Kane, as one of the bank tellers, produces an hilarious line. With the robbery in progress, she gets a phone call from her boyfriend. The latter asks her how long this is going to take? There was such laughter when she said this by the audience, I did not hear Pacino's response.Plenty of foul language goes around especially by Charles Durning, who plays the police detective.John Cazale is a Pacino cohort who invariably winds up shot to death for his \"day's\" work.An off-the-wall film that succeeds because of its dealings with human emotions, even when the latter are not deemed normal by society. Why has this great film become a cult legend? It deals with many societal problems and we see Pacino, the late Cazale and others as merely societal problems. Charles Durning, as the police officer, is magnificent here. He is brutal and yet can show some compassion as he learns about Sonny's twisted life. Pacino was totally memorable here and should have tied with Jack Nicholson for the best actor Oscar that year in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\" Ditto for the movie.

            "content": "If you have been a fan of any Al Pacino role and you have not seen Dog Day Afternoon, you have not yet experienced all that Al Pacino can offer. Dog Day Afternoon is by far Al Pacino's best work, and yes, I've seen The Godfather films. Sidney Lumet's 1975 feature Dog Day Afternoon showcases a depth of Al Pacino that I was unaware existed. Also starring John Cazale, Dog Day Afternoon explores the debilitating feeling of being torn in two directions by the world around you. The crisis one may confront by not being able to live their identity pushes Al Pacino's Sonny to rob a bank in order to get the money for his lover's sex-change operation. Gritty, raw, and soul-crushing, Lumet proves his directorial force while bringing out the best in Al Pacino to illustrate the depths one will go through to save himself by saving those around him.On a hot summer day in Brooklyn, New York, Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) set out to execute their plan to rob the Chase Manhattan Bank. After weeks of combing over their plans, coordinating delivery times, casing the outside and learning the best times to attract the least amount of attention, they finally enter the bank. Sonny is at a time of extreme desperation in his life. He experiences a listless home life with his wife and two kids, and he desperately wants to rob enough money from the bank to afford his partner Leon's (Chris Sarandon) sex change operation so the two may live together full-time. Sal, the understated partner in crime, an apathetic man, seems to have no direction in his life and is easily brought into the scheme by the promise of riches from the heist. The bank manager and teller staff agree to not interfere with the robbery, even helping the downtrodden robbers as best as they can. Thinking it will be a quick in and out affair, Sonny and Sal are rushing through the job until they realize that there is little money in the bank, as a majority of the money was taken out of the bank that same afternoon. Before they can escape, a call comes in from the police department that they have the bank surrounded. What began as a robbery quickly develops into a hostage situation as Sonny sees his plans foil all around him. Eventually, feeling sorry for the men who continuously vow not to hurt anyone, if they even could, a kinship develops between Sonny, Sal, and the bank employees. Now seeing the only way out as a jet out of the country in exchange for the safe release of hostages, Sonny unwillingly turns into a captor continuously negotiating the release of hostages and listing demands. At the depths of his own despair, Sonny prepares for the worst while hoping that he can still manage to make a life out of the mess he had before he ever stepped into the bank.This is one of those films that you watch and you hardly realize there are any other actors in it besides Al Pacino, he steals the show that much. Within the first 10 minutes, you could see the nuance brimming over the top of Pacino's characterization of Sonny. The most incredible part of this film, which also shows the directorial prowess of Sidney Lumet, was that by the 10-minute mark the duo had already entered the bank. A film that jumps into the action so early in the film may easily fall victim to poor pacing, especially considering that this is a film that takes place largely in one place. The pacing was never a problem in Dog Day Afternoon; each wrenching minute that elapsed emerged the audience even deeper into the mindset of Sonny and the desperation he was experiencing. I am a huge fan of films that take place in one setting, and I never thought I would like one more than I liked 12 Angry Men, also by Sidney Lumet, (obviously it's time for me to watch even more of his films) but Dog Day Afternoon takes the crown of best one setting film, in my book anyway. One setting films are so hard to do well, oftentimes, they come off stiff or too theatre-like, but Lumet knew what he was doing behind a camera leaving audiences with the best in the genre. You feel the desperation of Pacino's portrayal in such a way that stays with you days after viewing. Dog Day Afternoon is a standout, more than earning all of its critical acclaims. What a miss for Pacino from the Academy that year!",

However, from the moment that Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and Sal Naturile (John Cazale) step into the Chase Manhattan Bank in Brooklyn, New York City, their well-laid plans begin to unfurl. Within just minutes, the bank is surrounded by a \"militia\" of policemen and FBI agents, accompanied by a curious crowd of onlookers and a scurry of eager television journalists. With nine hostages as his only bargaining tools, Sonny must think of a way of getting himself and Sal out of this situation alive and free. But has he already come too far?'Dog Day Afternoon' is based on a real-life incident. On August 22 1972, John Wojtowicz, Salvatore Antonio Naturile and a third unknown accomplice attempted to rob a bank on the corner of East Third Street and Avenue P in Gravesend, Brooklyn. The eventual result of the real-life siege is best left unknown for those who are yet to see the film, but certainly director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Frank Pierson took a certain artistic license with some of the film's events, which have been described by one significant person at the scene as \"only 30% true.\" Nonetheless, this very same person praised the performances of Al Pacino and Chris Sarandon (as Sonny's \"wife,\" Leon) as being accurate.Al Pacino is superb in this movie. Fresh off the phenomenal success of 'The Godfather (1972),' 'Serpico (1973)' and 'The Godfather: Part 2 (1974),' Pacino truly was on his way to becoming one of the most outstanding performers of his generation, and his turn as Sonny Wortzik is most definitely no exception. Strong performances from his 'Godfather' co-star John Cazale, Chris Sarandon, Charles Durning, James Broderick and Sully Boyar make this a solidly-acted film.Lumet's decision to keep the film largely free of any musical score was a good decision, and certainly added to the realism of the plot. However, the one exception \u0096 Elton John's 'Amoreena' during the opening credits \u0096 simply didn't sit well with the tone of the remainder of the film, and he would probably have been best to leave it out. Also, though many of the film's scenes prove extremely riveting, there were certainly times when I noticed my attention somewhat wavering. Sonny's lengthy (and apparently improvised) telephone conversation with his \"wife\" Leon was one example of this \u0096 though it was definitely important to the story, and certainly showed off the skills of the two actors involved, I simply thought that it brought the film's steadily mounting suspense to a grinding halt.",

Al Pacino and John Cazale give classic performances, oozing charisma, false bravado, and mounting anxiety, leading to a near perfect crime-thriller.\"Dog Day Afternoon\" follows Al Pacino and John Cazale, two bumbling first-time criminals that decide to pull off a bank robbery in the middle of the afternoon. While they thought they planned their heist to perfection, things, of course, don't go to plan, and the audience gets treated to two hours of non-stop white knuckle suspense. I was on the edge of my seat for the entirety of this film - most thrillers have periods of slow down to let the audience breath; you won't find that here. The characters don't get any respite, and neither do the viewers. This leads to a relentlessly entertaining and nerve-wracking cinematic experience that carefully grasps the viewer and never lets go.Al Pacino and John Cazale are masterful in this movie, each giving their own very distinct performance. While Pacino is very outwardly intense, acting out and yelling at whoever is in his path, Cazale delivers a subtle type of intensity, always keeping calm and quiet on the outside while, no doubt, freaking out on the inside. There is one fantastic scene where Cazale quietly talks to Pacino, explaining how he is ready to start shooting the hostages in retaliation if Pacino is. It perfectly encapsulates the type of people we're dealing with, and does a great job of ramping up the tension.Another thing I loved about this movie is how unpredictable it is - from the moment the heist starts, things never go as expected for the characters, or for the viewers. I promise you that you won't be able to predict what's going to happen next. Nothing happens in a cinematically glossy way; this isn't a heist movie that glamorizes the robbers or the robbery, but instead simply shows what's happening, as it's happening. Also, there's a really good undercurrent of unexpected dark comedy throughout the film. Subtle lines and character moments make for good chuckles, and never reduce the tension or cheapen the experience. \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is a thriller, and even with its comedy, it never stops being what it sets out to be.\"Dog Day Afternoon\" is, without a doubt, a classic in the crime genre. It features fantastic performances, a riveting plot, great comedy, and non-stop suspense from beginning to end. If you're looking for a crime caper and haven't seen this, you owe it to yourself to give it a watch.",

            "content": "\"The medium is the message\", said media critic Marshall McLuhan in 1964. The presence of cameras, news equipment, and news reporters changes an event which may, as a result, take on the characteristics of a circus. Participants in the event get their \"fifteen minutes of fame\". Viewers get to gawk at reality and be entertained, no matter how tragic the event.An in-progress robbery turned media circus is the main theme of this true-life story about a Brooklyn man who, with an accomplice, tries to rob a bank. The man's name is Sonny. He's a guy with a heart, an interesting twist to our stereotyped image of bank robbers. Sonny's reason for the holdup would make for an ironic plot point in the film \"The Boys In The Band\" (1970).But from the get-go, Sonny's plans unravel quickly. A third accomplice chickens out at the last minute, embarrassing Sonny in the presence of the bank hostages. The amount of money in the vault is far less than expected. Some of the women hostages need to use the restroom, a development that our kindhearted criminal can't ignore. And an inquisitive storekeeper across the street gets suspicious. Soon, cops surround the bank. And what Sonny had envisioned as a simple easy-in, easy-out holdup evolves into an hour-after-hour ordeal, involving negotiations with the police.\"Dog Day Afternoon\" is alternately funny and sad. The script is rather talky. Some of the dialogue is improvised, which adds realism. Al Pacino, as Sonny, gives a fine performance. But he's rather nasal, and a little of his shrill ranting with the hostages and cops goes a long way.The film has no score. It opens with an Elton John song, presumably coming from Sonny's car radio. Color cinematography is fine. Most of the lighting is natural.I do think the film is about twenty minutes too long. After a while, those hours inside the bank become as tedious for viewers as for the hostages. This is a film that can leave you exhausted.The circumstances of this story are so outrageous that they would have been deemed too silly had they originated in the mind of a Hollywood scriptwriter. Viewers would not have taken the film seriously. But the events did actually happen, and for a reason that only someone as complex, driven, compulsive, and altruistic as Sonny could have dreamed up.",

It ranks very high on my all-time best list.Pacino has (rightfully) received two-and-a-half decades of accolades for his role as Sonny, the loser bank robber without the wit to hold up a Dunkin' Donuts, let alone a bank. Pacino may have won his Oscar for \"Scent of a Woman\", but this is the role he will be remembered for.But there are two key points to this film that often go overlooked. The first is John Cazale as Sal. Slow-witted and along for the ride, he is just as prepared to kill anyone who moves as he is to take a nap. Cazale was a gifted actor who only made five films before his untimely death - all five were best picture nominees and three of them won. This rivals his roles as Fredo for his best work.(Nods also go to Chris Sarandon and Charles Durning for their crucial supporting roles).The other fascinating point about this movie is its simplicity. It is essentially played out on one set and told like it is in real time, but it never really drags and it always finds a way of keeping your interest. Director Sydney Lumet creates an uneasy tension throughout this film that gnaws at you and makes you writhe in your seat. It has a walloping impact that lingers with you for days.This is a great story, skillfully directed with astonishing performances. **** out of ****.",

            "content": "I love the wonderful sense of New York in the 1970's that this film gives us. The characters, dialog, and shots on location in Brooklyn are all highly authentic. It's Al Pacino who really makes the film though, with a performance that is captivating and endearing. He's bumbling and ill-prepared as the leader of this bank heist, yet he's cagey and street-wise as a New York rat. We first get a glimpse of how amateurish these criminals are when one of the three bails early on in the robbery, which is a comical moment. We also smile at Pacino's handling of the situation. He realizes the importance of the hostages he suddenly finds himself holding, but far from being heavy-handed, he tries to be decent with them. He whips the crowd up into an anti-establishment frenzy by shouting \"Attica!\", throwing wads of money into the air, and paying for pizza delivery. He gets into a shouting match with a police sergeant (Charles Durning). He talks to his wife, mother, and transgender lover (Chris Sarandon), and each conversation is touched with pathos, and fantastic. To his mother he says \"I'm a fuck-up and I'm an outcast. If you get near me you're gonna get it. You're gonna get fucked over and fucked out.\" It's the outcast underdog that we find ourselves rooting for.I love the simple acceptance of his sexuality, which is incidental and doesn't devolve into some type of stereotype - well ahead of its time. Director Sidney Lumet shows the seamy side of New York, but at the same time, its humanity. The characters are blunt, but understanding of one another when they simply say what they want. The relationships in this tense stand-off are fascinating. I also liked how Lumet gets us into the story immediately. We learn the backstories and characters of the criminals, including Pacino's henchman (John Cazale) gradually, and in little moments, such as finding out he fears their escape plan because he's never been on an airplane before. The film works as both a hostage drama and as a character study. It may be a teeny bit too long at 125 minutes, but has held up well over the years, and is definitely worth watching.",

            "review_title": "The SNL of films about bank robberies",
            "content": "The prime goal of a bank robber, besides immediate financial gain, is efficiency, and this is for a number of reasons. Nobody wants to hear the story about a successful bank robber for the very virtue that he was successful and, on that particular day, evil won. The immortalized stories and the ones that get repeated through generations, or, in this case, get movies made about them, are those that were peculiar or not-so successful. An inefficient bank robber has more of a probability of their identity being discovered, their alibi in case of indictment being compromised, or their ultimate goal of getting the money and running being corrupted by the police, who's prime goal is also efficiency. The issue is that robbing a bank can go a number of different ways and nobody really knows what will happen until it is happening.These reasons and more are why the story of John Wojtowicz is so intriguing. Based on the true story - a story so absurd that it must be reiterated time and time again that it is indeed rooted in fact - of a bank robbery taking place in Brooklyn back in 1972, Dog Day Afternoon follows three men, Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino), his friend Sal Naturale (John Cazale), and another accomplice named Stevie (Gary Springer). The three men attempt to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank one morning, and the plan goes awry almost immediately when Stevie loses his cool and abandons the two men after Sal first draws his gun. In another unfortunate circumstance, Sonny and Sal realize they've chosen to rob the bank right after the daily cash pickup truck has arrived, meaning the bank only has around $1,000 in the vault.Sonny attempts to make up for this circumstance by stealing the bank's traveler's checks and burning the bank's ledger that keeps track of all of them. The smoke from the small blaze alerts nearby businesses and law-enforcement of suspicious activities, and what was supposed to be a routine, by-the-numbers robbery becomes a hostage situation and a media spectacle. The incompetent and defeated Sonny winds up attempting to hold the young, female bank tellers hostage, as well as maintain his cool long enough to request enough supplies and transportation to get him and Sal to safety as quickly as possible.The problem is that, throughout the course of Dog Day Afternoon, nothing happens as quickly or as conveniently for the characters as possible. The result is like watching a pathetic bank robbery put on by a band of Saturday Night Live cast members, as both Sonny and Sal are stuck between a rock and a hard place throughout the entire film. This also makes this particular film so interesting because of its constant situational humor that seems to keep building and developing as the film goes along. Nothing goes right for the characters, despite their efforts to make things work, and that's one of the fundamental building blocks of comedy that director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Frank Pierson constantly toy with.By classification and its inherent nature, Dog Day Afternoon is a crime drama. It centers around a bank robbery and, regardless of how ill-conceived and managed such the bank robbery is, its narrative is ultimately fixated on a crime. Having said that, it's worth noting how seamlessly Lumet and Pierson interweave comedy and dry wit into the film's narrative, not turning the contents of the story into a laugh riot desperate for uproarious reactions from the audience, but allowing the pathetic characters and the poor circumstance to work for themselves and create comedy very naturally. It's only right that Al Pacino, an actor who can play both low-key and over-the-top, often in the same film, lead the cast as a character who, throughout the course of the film, looks like the personification of an unattended pot left to hopelessly boil over on the stove with nobody in sight to save or cool it down.Dog Day Afternoon's sole setting and slight number of characters allows for familiarity in faces and locations to build very elegantly. Neither Lumet nor Pierson get too caught up in the spectacle of the entire event and shift the focus away from the interior meltdown to the commotion occurring outside. I'd actually be hardpressed to believe, at least after seeing this, that a short film centered around a successful bank robbery captured in one setting would be as tense as this. The unpredictability and the sheer lunacy of all that is unfolding really assist the film in creating something so crazy without gratuitous shock value that it's truly something to behold for all of its one-hundred and twenty minutes.Starring: Al Pacino, John Cazale, Gary Springer. Directed by: Sidney Lumet.",

            "review_title": "..Sonny should have gone to Mom..",
            "content": "This movie is difficult to review, because the list of actors-actresses don't tell you who played whom. The atmosphere inside the bank was definitely controlled by the group of ladies who were being held hostage. At the beginning of the robbery, Pacino (Sonny) was all macho to convince the hostages he was serious; they were terrified. Farther along into the robbery, the ladies could see by \"Sonny's\" concern for their safety, and became almost relaxed. His early release of the bank-guard and his immediate calling for a doctor to treat the manager - plus the pizzas! - let them see beneath his blustery.\"Sal,\" on the other hand, was sinister but could not have been a Vietnam-veteran, because his role originally was written for an 18-year-old. So, we are left to decide for ourselves how he became so sinister so young in life. I prefer to accept he was older and would kill without remorse. Cazale portrayed that characteristic superbly, although we are left to wonder at his intelligence, just the \"enforcer\" to back-up \"Sonny\"? Another fact from \"trivia\" tells us that the real robbers got $213,000, quite a nice haul for that period. Frank Pierson's award-winning Oscar heightened the entire disaster of the robbery, telling us there was only $1100.00 in the vault - it did not mention it was a Chase bank. Again we are left to decide for ourselves \"and it is all true\" really is, OR not. I prefer to stick to the script.........except to disbelieve that the character \"Leon\" was a woman trapped in the body of a man. Nah! \"Leon\" was too handsome, although he did come-across as a trifle sissified. Other \"users\" say this was his first major role; great acting, but I don't remember any other role he played. Maybe I'm too old. \"Trivia\" also tells us that the telephone-conversation between \"Sonny\" and \"Leon\" was not scripted, as many other scenes were not......purely improvised. To me, THAT would have been the best scene in the entire film, not even considering how realistic and believable the synergy between the two characters was. Wonder what Pierson thought about that?Younger reviewers often want to believe that not much was happening during the '70s. They weren't around. Surprise ! sex-change operations were old hat by then, the best being performed at universities many years before. Nothing really controversial in that theme. Not everyone could just walk-up and have the operation done. They had to live in female clothing for one year pre-surgery and pass many psychic therapies. How ironic \"Sonny\" decided to head for Algeria - that's where American men were mutilated in the first operations........\"Leon\" would have felt right at home. So, Young-uns, do a little research before making serious-sounding statements. I knew several \"trans-gendered\" people post-surgery long before the '70s.......\"Sonny's\" character would lead us to think of him as being Italian, not Polish. Because of Pacino's role in \"The Godfather\" movies, I repeat from other reviews that The Mafia were homosexual, too - not too many movies about them bring that out. In the film, \"Sonny\" says \"you gotta have a little fun in life\", after the ladies in the bank hear the TV-reporter say \"two homosexuals\" - which would leave us to believe all this gay-life wasn't too unusual to him. When the NY detective sees \"Leon\", he registers a little surprise, then goes-on to handle the situation with brilliance - bravo! for Durning. NO New York detective is going to be surprised when a little homosexuality comes into play.I'm not really a fan of \"The Godfather\" films, so I rate this role by Pacino as one of his best. \"Scarface\" was a melodrama, to me - way over the top. \"Dog Day Afternoon\" - in all of its unlikeliness - could have happened just as it was scripted. Every one of the actors-actresses was stellar. The crowds outside in the street were a big contribution to the excitement of the film. The FBI-guys were right-on - I am left to wonder why they were determined to \"take care of Sal\" - what had he done but robbed a bank? No investigation of the shooter ?The will-writing scene was particularly moving. Perhaps that was \"Sonny's\" first inkling for the dance to get into the bus, all the parade to the airport, the jet - everything - was just another situation to go wrong. Not one of the reviewers mentioned that he did not spend a time long in prison, and his name has not surfaced again, that I know of. It's difficult to not sympathize with the villains of this movie, because they actually did nothing wrong, but attempt to rob the bank. Some bank-robbers would have been so taken-aback to discover the vault empty, they may have mowed everyone down out of anger.This story gives us much insight into how individuals react to unpleasant incidents, but get to take part in a story for the grandkids.......let's face it, it takes an extra-ordinarily moral person not to be tempted to become wealthy by robbing banks, otherwise there wouldn't be so many dangerous Fridays in the banking-business. I'll stay poor from fear and weakness.......\"Dog Day Afternoon\" gave me another reason to live less dangerously. This is a 10-out-of-ten all around......even without a musical score",

Apparently based on true events (with the real names having been changed) the movie provides a fascinating look at both the bungled bank job and Sonny's extremely complicated personal life. Divorced from his wife (with whom he had two children) Sonny had begun a relationship with a pre-operative transsexual (played by Chris Sarandon) who was becoming suicidal over not being able to afford a sex change operation. In partnership with Sal (John Cazale) Sonny robs the bank, but the police respond very quickly and Sonny ends up with a bank full of hostages. An interesting aside in the movie is watching how the various hostages handled the situation. The only real weakness I can see in this movie is that there's no explanation of who Sal was, or of how he was connected with Sonny. Sal provides a bit of humour to the movie. He comes across as completely lost, and begins to worry when he finds out that the media are reporting that the robbers are \"two homosexuals.\" He wasn't a homosexual, and he wanted the world to know that! Charles Durning also put on a good performance as NYPD Detective Moretti, who's handling the robbery, and who comes across as a pretty decent guy who really wants to find a way out of this for everyone.Essentially what we have here is a fascinating story complemented by excellent performances all around.

            "review_title": "A taut thriller made many times better by the absolutely brilliant Pacino",
            "content": "I didn't feel like Dog Day Afternoon was quite the absolute classic that everyone has held it up to. I think the thing that makes it truly incredible is it is yet another showcase of a young actor and what made him Hollywood Royalty, the always astonishingly amazing Al Pacino. Perhaps the film was more controversial and shocking in the seventies being that it was based on very factual events and seems to have held very true to the reality of that situation. Certainly it has it's charms as a character study because you do get a very in depth look into the characters and their lives especially Sonny (played by Pacino.) It would seem to me that director Sidney Lumet recognizes talent like no other director in the history of Hollywood being that seventeen of his stars from his films went on to Oscar nominations. That makes him a world class director or just a really good judge of acting ability and I think it's the latter because it seems to me he just lets Pacino do his magic and it literally saves this film from being run of the mill and slipping into obscurity. There are dozens of films just like this that don't get the same accolades that this one does.Al Pacino plays conflicted and intense Sonny Wortzik. He is the reason to see this film as he goes through the emotional workings of what he has done and his entire life is pulled out before him and the media circus. It's an angry and powerful performance and he should receive a 10/10 his sole performance it is that good. John Cazale fits in with the story as quiet and dark partner Sal but he never really gets any moments to stand out and is second fiddle to Pacino easily. His character is just kind of there and doesn't really add or take away from anything in the film. Charles Durning is very good as the first lead officer on the scene who starts bargaining with Sonny. I would have like to have seen Durning and Pacino talk more and be involved longer but he gets replaced fairly quickly. Chris Sarandon, who was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Oscar for this role is decent as Pacino's male lover looking for a sex change. However, I think he is over hyped a little because I don't think his performance was THAT good and even though they're long phone conversation and a very important part and a turning point in the film I didn't think Sarandon was mind blowing by any means. James Broderick is also very good in a fairly small role as the bank manager.Most say the script (which won an Oscar) is smart and funny and witty and it is but I kind of feel like it's over analyzed and maybe put on too high of a pedestal. Outside of Pacino's brilliant performance everything else is pretty average. I mean if you subtract Pacino from the film it deserves maybe a six out of ten but he drives up the stakes with a heart wrenching performance. Impressively the entire film nearly takes place in and outside the bank and it's never boring, the story moves along at a great pace and never keeps you waiting for anything. The film isn't violent being only two shots are fired in the entire film but in true film noire style it is chock full of dark satire and the old message of sticking it to the man which evolved from the sixties into a Watergate society of the seventies. Dog Day Afternoon in any circle is considered a classic and I don't disagree. I just happen to think that Pacino is what makes the wheels spin and it's worth seeing for his performance and because it is a good movie, just falls short of being as great as everyone seems to think it is. 7.5/10",

Based on the true story, first-time crooks Sonny Wortzik (BAFTA winning, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino) and Sal (The Godfather's Golden Globe nominated John Cazale) entered the Chase Manhattan First Savings Bank in Flatbush, Brooklyn hoping to carry out a quick robbery. They took their guns out and got the held up staff to take out the money, but they didn't realise that the bank had been emptied out earlier, so there isn't much money to take. Soon the phone rings, it is Police Captain Det. Sgt. Eugene Moretti (The Muppet Movie's Golden Globe nominated Charles Durning) wanting to speak to Sonny, the building is surrounded with the city's whole police force, and a crowd wanting to see something. Sonny goes outside to see for himself, and shouting his defensive words he gets the crowd on his side, but he and Sal have little options to get out of this. Sonny starts making some demands to get out of their situation, he wants a car ready to take him, Sal and the remaining hostages to the airport with a ready plane to fly abroad. While the hostages relax a little more, Sonny also demands that they bring his wife to talk to, who is revealed to be his gay lover Leon Shermer (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Chris Sarandon), the money stolen would have been for his sex change operation. Eventually, after little progress, and the FBI led by Agent Sheldon (James Broderick) showing up, a car is ready for Sonny and Sal, and a plane is also ready at the airport. With the co-operation of the police and FBI, Sonny and Sal get the remaining hostages into the car, letting go only one, and they are joined by driver Murphy (Lance Henriksen). They reach the airport with little problems, and see the approaching plane, but Sal is the more dangerous of the two men, so Murphy shoots him between the eyes, while Sonny is arrested and ready for prison, the hostages are safe and sound. Also starring Sully Boyar as Mulvaney, Penelope Allen as Sylvia, Carol Kane as Jenny, Beulah Garrick as Margaret, Sandra Kazan as Deborah, Marcia Jean Kurtz as Miriam, Amy Levitt as Maria, John Marriott as Howard, Estelle Omens as Edna and Gary Springer as Stevie. Pacino gives a really good performance with a mixture of emotions, the supporting cast also do well in their parts, and it has some good moments to put you in the scenes, it may be a little weird but its all apparently true, so a very watchable crime drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Screenplay and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Al Pacino was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Robert De Niro) on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 86 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (\"Attica!\" Attica!\"), and it was number 70 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills.

Your goals, your position in society, opportunities overall, and how sometimes goals are difficult to reach and make you do extreme things.The performance by Al Pacino is simply amazing, literally amazing. It amazed me the fact that he shows desperation, loyalty, believes in his ideas, greed, believes in his fictional future, suffers because of the fact that his male lover is in pain, shows desperation when he still believes he can escape... And when everything is lost, through the lines \"don't shoot\" he demonstrates MANY emotions at the same time. Masterful performance.John Cazale deserved an Oscar nomination for his nerve tensing acting. He looked scared, depressed, but at the same time angry and decided to reach his goal at all costs. He was the FBI's target because he was a very dangerous man.Mr. Broderick also delivers a fine, underrated performance. His display as the tactic, intelligence FBI agent is great. The man has a strong temper and a cool behavior when negotiating. Charles Durning is also great as always. He plays cops like no other! Sidney Lumet is a wonderful director. He creates an uncomfortable vibe because of the violent events and tense negotiations.The Direction is fantastic. It has this grainy and depressing look mainly because of the setting and the splendid cinematography. The absence of music/score makes it an almost theatrical feature. The dialogs are great, menacing, humorous.They just don't make movies like this anymore. This is one of the best thrillers of all time.After the shocking climax, you can't feel but stay quiet for some minutes after the end credits roll in the airport... A unique visual experience.",

            "content": "A film of solid reputation, having all the signs of being a classic, but which ultimately falls down on a number of levels, resulting in it being good but slightly disappointing.The story is based on fact, about a bank robbery in Brooklyn which becomes a media event, heightened when it is discovered the lead robber needs the money for his gay lovers sex-change operation. The action takes place over the course of one day and 90% of the action is played out inside the bank, where the employees are kept hostage and outside where the police and a growing crowd of onlookers have formed in numbers.The two bank robbers are big-time losers, both played quite brilliantly by Al Pacino and John Cazale. Pacino gives the performance of his life as the sweaty, agitated, nervous Sonny, while Cazale is if anything even better, as the forlorn, quiet, desperately sad-looking Sal. The tragedy of the two is summed up in a hopelessly optimistic conversation when discussing where they want the jet, which they have demanded for the release of the hostages, to take them. Sonny asks \"Is there any special country you want to go to ?\", to which Sal replies \"Wyoming\".The film suffers though in its supporting characters, none of which have any depth to them. This is due mainly to the script which gives them little to do, although most performances apart from the two principals are routine at best. The bank manager and the female hostages are not developed to any degree - as the audience, we care for the two robbers, but not at all for the hostages. The police officers, and FBI agents, are all stereotypical and are unable to force either a positive or negative reaction.Many of the scenes in the latter part of the film only repeat characterisations and themes which have already been addressed. The scenes involving Sonny outside the bank playing up to the cheering crowds are good ( repeatedly shouting 'Put your guns down' and 'Attica' to the armed masses of police ), but they go on too long and there are too many of them. It is unfair to criticise 'Dog Day Afternoon' too much, as it is still very good. The film should have been much tighter, more evenly paced, at least half an hour shorter, and, like Lumets earlier classic '12 Angry Men', concentrated on dialogue for character development. What should have been a genuine early 70's classic is instead something of a missed opportunity.",

Not because the movie was so emotional.It was the realization that director Sidney Lumet had been reduced to directing garbage such as Guilty as Sin.Dog Day Afternoon is Lumet at his best. You have to keep reminding yourself that it is a true story.Lumet has brought comedy and absurdity to what was a terrifying bank robbery.Set in 1972. Al Pacino is Sonny Wortzik. A Vietnam vet and former bank teller. Along with his friends Sal Naturile (John Cazale) and Stevie they go to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank.Only for Stevie to lose his nerve and dash out. The the other two discover that there is hardly much cash in the bank.When Sonny sets a trash can on fire, the smokes arouses suspicion and the police are called.In a panic Sonny and Sal hold the other bank employees hostage. Before long Sonny is overwhelmed with the police, FBI and members of the public who have gathered and instilled a carnival spirit.Sal is edgy and volatile who is prepared to kill the hostages. Sonny tries to remain calm but then his wife and lover contact him.It turns out that the motive for the robbery was so Sonny could pay for a sex change operation for his lover Leon.The movie has a tour de force performance from Pacino. He is in his element as he rouses the crowd surrounding the bank. It is theatre rather than movie acting. By the climax, it is just silence from Pacino has he conveys mood and confusion with his eyes.Cazale has a quieter and less showy role as shy and dim Sal. He is embarrassed and upset that people might think he is also gay. Sal is the loose cannon with an itchy trigger finger.Lumet played a blinder in reuniting Pacino and Cazale on screen again.The cast is uniformly excellent. Charles Durning as the exasperated police captain who is the negotiator, Chris Sarandon as Leon who is transitioning. Lance Henriksen as the mostly silent FBI agent, Susan Peretz as Sonny's wife.Dog Day Afternoon starts out as a comedy of errors but you know it will get darker as they head off to their getaway plane.It has a gritty and chaotic New York summer atmosphere. Hot and sweaty with an urban stench of losers driven to desperation.Dog Day Afternoon is outrageously funny and also drenched with humanity. For a movie made in 1975, it had a more sensitive portrayal of gay and trans characters.One of the great movies of the 1970s.",

            "content": "Yet another film that displays Al Pacino's superb acting skills, Dog Day Afternoon does not disappoint. A true story in which two friends, Sonny (Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale), have decided their luck has ran out and that the only way to solve that is by robbing a bank. I found the reasoning behind the robbery to be quite sincere although very unorthodox from what we're used to. What should have been a simple snatch and grab job turns into a media frenzied nightmare for the duo, mostly because of their naivety, lack of judgment, and a tad bit too much compassion. Dog Day Afternoon is a different bank heist movie in that for one, it's a true story, and two, the robbers involved aren't all that up to the task for their seemingly lack of planning and conviction to do what needs to be done in order to achieve success, which treats us to scenes that aren't typical in other films with the same premise. Filled with humorous moments and glimpses of their ineptitude, DDA keeps us guessing as to what will happen next. John Cazale as Sal is particularly intriguing as the quiet killer and is more enjoyable here than in The Godfather films and The Deer Hunter, mainly due to the difference in his characters. And as mentioned earlier, Pacino is Pacino...no need to really elaborate there. Chris Sarandon as Leon is also worth mentioning.The beginning of the film is particularly interesting as we see the mistakes the robbers begin to make early on, which preludes to the media and law enforcement frenzy that ensues. It continues in this fashion until about 3/4 of the way through where it slows down a bit and could have used a little more editing. The ending is slightly anti-climatic but this is due in part to it's basis on a true story. It could have been slightly better, but overall a great film. Although typically inconsistent, I feel Lumet did a great job.I just wish Chris Saradon as Leon would have said, \"Jesuth Christht.\" That would have killed me.",

            "content": "Dog Day Afternoon is a perfect example of a character drama that slowly builds into something much more. Sidney Lumet's finest film starts off as a simple bank robbery but eventually becomes not only the shattering tale of this true story but also a commentary on the media and the public. Al Pacino's Sonny Wortzik is essentially a normal guy who has been put into circumstances to commit a crime, but he is quickly turned by everyone else into something much more. An idol to some and a monster to others, the public create this figure who stands as something to them beyond anything that he actually is.We hear tales from the people in his life, from his wife Angie to his lover Leon (played so well by Chris Sarandon), of what a bastard he is, often falling victim to an explosive temper, yet the public sees him as a hero. He screams obscenities at the police and forces them to recall the Attica Prison riot, feeding off the attention that he is given by the public. They turn him into something else, but inside the bank he's just a cornered man who doesn't know what to do. Pacino's portrayal is his finest work and stands as one of the finest performances I've ever seen in a film. He is fascinating, empathetic and always commanding.Sonny is a significantly flawed man, but Pacino makes it easy to see why the hostages he takes were so enamored with him. The real life workers of the bank commented after words that they had a great time and if Sonny and his partner Sal (John Cazale) had been over at their house for a dinner party it would have been one of the best nights of their life, and Pacino shows this side of Sonny in his performance. The people who knew him tell a totally different side of him than what we see in the bank, but as the walls close in on him you can see those other layers start to creep out.It's a grueling experience for Sonny, lasting over an entire day inside that bank, and Pacino makes you feel every minute of it by the end. He starts off on fire, exploding off the screen in the opening scenes, but as the day wears on he becomes beaten and exhausted, perhaps not thinking as clearly as he should and maybe even wanting to be arrested just so that the whole disastrous experience can be over. Pacino creates a performance as sensational as the media and public turned Sonny into, and it's a wonder to behold and made even more impressive by the fact that most of the dialogue (including the lengthy phone conversation between him and Sarandon) was improvised.",

            "content": "The movie is as surreal today as it was watching it forty years ago when it first came out. Nominally a crime drama, the film in a lot of ways is a comedy without trying to be. All you need to see is Sonny (Al Pacino) fumble the gift box hiding his rifle, and you know that this is a pair of would-be bank robbers who are in way over their head. Sonny even needs to take guff from head teller Sylvia (Penelope Allen) who chastises him for not having a plan! What's even crazier is that this was based on a true story. Just for the heck of it, I looked up the 'real' Sonny, John Wojtowicz, the bank robber who inspired the movie. The photo of him posted on Wikipedia bears an amazingly strong resemblance to Pacino, something I wasn't quite expecting. Wojtowicz, before he died, stated that the movie was only about thirty per cent accurate, but did praise Pacino's characterization of him, and Chris Sarandon's performance as his gay lover, called Leon in the story.One thing about the movie for anyone who grew up in or around New York City during the era, it's a great time capsule reminder of the way things used to be. The Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are visible in a quick scan of the city skyline, and I did more than a double take at the fifty cent toll on one of the city bridges in the picture. Even WOR Radio is still going strong using the same 710 broadcast frequency.Sonny's partner in crime at the First Brooklyn Savings Bank was portrayed by John Cazale in a greatly understated but pivotal role. He was the focus of the quote in my summary line, admonished by a bank teller after he stated that she shouldn't smoke because 'the body is the Temple of the Lord'. The story is full of individual quirks like that, making it one of the most unusual crime capers you're likely to experience in a movie. Cazale unfortunately died of cancer at the age of forty two shortly after this film was completed. Having only appeared in five feature films before passing away, he holds the unusual distinction of portraying characters in two different movies who are shot in the head, once from the front, and once from behind (\"Godfather II\").",

But the crazy revelation that the whole scheme was thought up because money was needed for the sex-change operation of the homosexual robber's lover, well\u0085 that is so surreal and far-fetched that it simply has to be true! If any aspiring scriptwriter would present this type of idea to a random producer, he/she wouldn't receive a single penny for it. But you know what? The biggest accomplishment of writer Frank Pierson, director Sidney Lumet and \u2013 of course \u2013 the phenomenal actor Al Pacino \u2013 is that they managed to keep the essence of the story rather small and personal. All the socially relevant themes are downgraded to mere sub plots while the private story of Sonny is gradually put forward. He's intelligent but insecure, anxiety-ridden and utterly self-destructive.

            "content": "I have a confession to make. As I was watching Dog Day Afternoon for this review, I realized my DVD copy was scratched and it would not play the last half of the movie. But luckily, I have seen this movie before and I am fortunate enough to remember how the movie ended. Both times I watched the film, I enjoyed it very much. Given the talent behind and in front of the camera, that comes to me as no surprise. Sidney Lumet is a very talented director who directed incredible films such as 12 Angry Men and Serpico. Lumet reunites with his Serpico star Al Pacino to create a very fine portrayal of a real-life story about a Brooklyn bank robbery. The film is more subtle and quiet when compared to other Lumet films, but the film has an unexpected lighter tone. The film has some funny lines and I was surprised how much I laughed given the subject matter, but then I realized Lumet was not trying to make a serious film. The thematic issue of gay marriage gave the movie a political edge which also surprised me. I was expecting a straightforward movie about a bank robbery, but I got something more in-depth. There is motivation behind what the characters do and that caused me to sympathize with them, despite robbing a bank and holding people hostage. You may have figured by now, but I really enjoyed this film very much.Believe it or not, but this story is based off real events which occurred at the Chase Manhattan Bank in Brooklyn, New York in 1972. The bank was held up by this gay man named Sonny (Al Pacino) and his dim-witted crime partner Sal (John Cazale) in order to get money to pay for Sonny's partner sex change operation. The manager and tellers agree to cooperate with Sonny, but things go south when Sonny realizes there is not anything to steal because the money has been packed up for the day. When Sonny gets in contact with Police Captain Moretti (Charles Durning), he gets nervous when he realizes the entire bank is surrounded by cops. Now he must negotiate a way to get what he wants without compromising the safety of everyone in the bank.Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors of all-time. He commits to every single role of his, even if the movie stinks. Obviously, this is not a stinker but it is impressive to see Pacino so committed to this role. I loved his performances in the two Godfather movies and Serpico. So it comes to no surprise I am impressed with this performance. This time around he brings an edge of comedy to his performance and it works spectacularly. The scene where he is being live broadcasted and he skips around in happiness telling people he's a star, that was a wonderful but funny scene. John Cazale does a fine job as Sal. I felt Sal's character goes hand-in-hand with John's character in The Godfather, but regardless it was still a fine performance. Charles Durning plays it tough as the NYPD captain as he should because it easily fits his persona. Finally, Chris Sarandon as Sonny's lover Leon does a fine job in his small role-a role that got him nominated for an Oscar.I thought it was interesting about the political angle given to this movie. Gay marriage would not be a major political issues until many years after the release of this film, but it was interesting to see the viewpoint of the movie given how gay marriage was frowned upon during this era. The movie played the sympathy cards for Sonny and Leon and it gave a motivation for Sonny's actions. The movie does not revile Sonny, but instead it makes him a deeply-flawed character.Overall, Dog Day Afternoon is a excellent movie. It has committed performances by everyone, especially by Pacino. Sadly, Pacino still did not receive an Oscar up to this point despite being nominated for every movie he was in until 1975 including this one. Sidney Lumet continues to bring his style into all of his films. I love Lumet because like auteurs like Scorsese and Allen, many of his films are about New York. Each individual brings something to their films about the great city of New York and they make these films even more interesting to watch. I like the way Lumet turned the film from just an ordinary crime film to a film that is intelligent, creative, and still fun to watch. This is another impressive film on the resume for Sidney Lumet and Al Pacino.My Grade: A",

It was a heartbreaking as Sonny accepts his future and had acknowledged what happened. It all started as a simple bank robbery but then it turned into mental games that have been playing against Sonny and his goodness that keeps telling him to be good. Pacino provided one of the most heartbreaking, powerful, insane and mind bending performances that has been seen at the screen. John Cazale has also shown us what a strong character he is as portraying Sal. Extraordinary writing and dialogues, with creation of some tense scenes. 3.5/4",

I have seen this film at least a dozen times, and I know I love it, but I'm consistently surprised by just how great it really is and how many different things this film tackles and how well it accomplishes everything. It's a character study and it contains what is easily one of Pacino's greatest performances. (I was struck by how much you can just enjoy staring at Pacino's face on film.) It's about the relatively new phenomena of a media circus surrounding an event, and it's probably never been dealt with in a better way on film. It's pretty much a perfect film.",

            "content": "Based on a true crime and a notable media circus, Dog Day Afternoon retells the tale of John Wojtowicz (Al Pacino) and Salvatore Naturale (John Cazale), two Vietnam War vets, who have been beaten down by life and one day have a bright idea: \"Hey, banks have money, right?\"The movie takes us through the events in a slow, deliberate manner. Almost no music is used, the set is almost just the bank and the street outside, the actors were given a lot of freedom to improvise their lines - especially the heated parts - and all in all the film tries to really take you there.And it works. Especially because Pacino and Cazale are two such memorable, identifiable actors. Their characters are two simple idiots, who really didn't have a plan beyond walking in with guns. But that's what makes this movie stand out. These two feel like real people, with their odd idiosyncrasies and short-fused tempers. They're certainly not the criminal masterminds you usually see in heist movies.That being said, the film can feel a bit slow, but then again, that's sort of the point. Once they end up taking hostages, it becomes a waiting game, and that's reflected in how the story is told. Could the narrative be a bit tighter? Maybe, but then again, just as I was about to become genuinely bored, the film picked up the pace and threw in some now plot developments. So it's a measured amount of slowness. Can't really argue against it.Dog Day Afternoon is a great watch if you're a Pacino fan or you're looking for a film where it feels like you could round a corner and walk straight into it.",

I was interested in the characters, what they were doing, why they were doing it, and what was going to happen because of it. The film really does take you down one dark road to another with twists and turns you won't see coming. The whole concept of the bank heist was executed brilliantly in this film. The screenplay was definitely deserved its Oscar. The scenes with Sonny going back and forth with Moretti were crazy. And all the scenes with Sonny trying to figure out wtf he needs to do was were also great.Overall, I thought Dog Day Afternoon was an amazing film. It was really well written and it was extremely intense as well. The acting from Al Pacino was immaculate and the dialogue from all the characters was not only intelligent but intriguing.

Al Pacino plays Sonny, who makes an armed robbery attempt that draws the attention of the media. He is joined by the nervous gun touting Salvatore, played by John Cazale. While they secretly refuse to kill anyone, the law outside bargains unsuccessfully for hostages, which include the bank manager, several female clerks, and an asthmatic security guard whom they let go. Chilling back and forth tension as it is discovered that Sonny has a wife and two children but also a male lover going through the process of a sex change. This has the media in a roar cheering Sonny's rebellious nature with even the hostages warming up to his nature. Director Sidney Lumet previously worked with Pacino in the excellent Serpico. As Sonny, Pacino mirrors the frustration and desperation of somebody thinking he can somehow escape consequences. Cazale as Salvatore is more reserved and seen more as a trigger warning by cops. Charles Durning plays a negotiator struggling to maintain order outside as well as inside the bank. Chris Sarandon plays Leon, Sonny's male lover who confesses his inability to reason with him. Sully Boyar plays the diabetic bank manager. Cruel media celebration of sin and one's interpretation of right and wrong. Score: 9 / 10",

            "review_title": "The magic of words",
            "content": "Based on something that really happened and was put down in words in an article, Frank Pierson wrote a wonderful screenplay that required putting down the first words in words again. It's a wonderful thing, words. You would never imagine the important part they play in a bank robbery: what to say to the hostages, how to treat them, what to discuss between partners, what to discuss between partners, what to tell the police or the FBI when they want to negotiate. Fortunately, Sonny (Al Pacino) is very good with words. He's so good that he manages to achieve a good relationship with the typical public that gathers in the streets every time there is a robbery. Sidney Lumet's \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is the tale of Sonny and Sal (John Cazale), two guys who enter a bank and plan to rob it quickly but end up staying the whole afternoon, and night. The movie is a harsh declaration against the role of the media in robberies, with cameras and reporters all over the place, not knowing exactly what they're doing but knowing they have to do something; against the role of the police, who say one thing and do another and keep their guns up while Sonny is constantly coming out of the bank with a white flag. Of course it all revolves around Pacinos's frenetic performance, in his first major role after \"The Godfather Part II\". At one point he comes out of the bank and goes ballistic, demanding detective Moretti (Charles Durning) to tell the police officers to put their guns down, and screaming to the public about an event that happened in Attica. He didn't expect it, but he wins the public and becomes your 'freak show' of the day (as he would say); a kind of 'hero of the moment' everyone wants to talk to, which brings problems for the police to work properly.Did Sonny want this? We never know, but he uses it in his favor. We actually never know quite exactly what Sonny wants, and Sidney Lumet is kind enough to let us figure it out. The director focuses on the tension, establishing a clear difference of what's going on inside and outside the bank and then translates all this to Sonny's changes of mood. \"I'm dying here\", he says to several people in different moments of the film; and we don't know if he's serious or if he's saying it to appear as a victim to the police.Because Sonny (and Sal, if you pay close attention) is not the guy who would enter a bank and rob it; that's something we can deduce because he knows things and he's, in general terms, kind and worrying. What Lumet does is putting us through a horrible experience as viewers, where we can never exactly decipher what the main character will do next and why he acts the way he acts and why people say something about him we can never get to see. It's frustrating that there's a human side of the movie and that we want to know all about it but we never get chance, unless we want to elaborate an own theory. I'm making a wild guess here, but how much could have Pierson known about this man in order to put it in his script? Probably nothing. And then we go back to the magic of words; because everything we can find out about Sonny, we do through his words. And his words are managing three expectations at the time: what the hostages expect, what the police expect and what his partner Sal expects. It's marvelous to see how he manages it and how Lumet never loses the tension, and how among all of this unpredictable things, the film never stops creating unexpected moments.",

It's not just a crime thriller but also a social comment on poverty, the disenfranchised and abusive police. It also sags in the middle, which would normally be a negative, but one I can easily overlook because the film's benefits are so damn good.From minute one, you can feel the hot summer atmosphere just as much as Al Pacino's clear-as-day exhaustion. From what I've read, there was a good deal of improv on the set and that adds to the overall unpredictability; these are scripted characters but they don't fit neatly into boxes. The onlooking crowd will root for Pacino as a populist hero one minute and then turn to jeering the next; the bank employees go from victimized to moralizing; and then there's the enlightened matter-of-fact handling of gay characterization. Fifty years ago? I have to commend the filmmakers on that, no question.Dog Day Afternoon is an excellent drama, hugely benefiting from acting and direction. The question of how it will all end burns for much of the running time; and the final ten minutes, from motorcade to tarmac, is a nail-biter.This is Lumet in the '70s and it is terrific.",

Other than TCM, there is only a slim chance of viewing this movie on television.\nFinally getting to see the movie and its star Al Pacino was a bigger treat than I expected. Watching this robbery/hostage drama made me feel like I was right there minute by minute as the story unfolded. Sidney Lumet, a director of so many great movies set in New York, knew the territory.\nThe movie is set in 1970s Brooklyn and it captures the squalor and the mood of one New York neighbourhood. At the time, New York was dealing with crime, bankruptcy, racial strife and the loss of faith in government. Pacino, playing Sonny, is an unemployed Italian-American in a failing marriage. Part of the story is an alliance he builds with neighbours who cheer for him as he is surrounded by police, FBI, and media reporters.\nJohn Cazale plays his buddy Sal and Charles Durning is the seasoned police chief caught in a highly charged standoff between the police and the supportive crowd who cheer on the hostage takers. The full cast is great.\nGlad I finally saw this movie, which I can now add to the many other great movies I've seen from the 1970's. Highly recommend.",

Its a very big performance, which is great to watch, but it does not feel mocking or unsympathetic on Pacino's part. I think we like Sonny very much - probably not as much as the crazy 70's crowd who are shouting \"power to the people\" and other desperate demonstrating phrases.8/10.

The internal struggle of our hero is portrayed very well, nuanced and subtle, as he tries to come to terms with his sexuality and lashes out in frustration, desperate to be heard as those he knows either ignore him or blame him for their own problems. The bank heist itself is rendered incredibly realistically, with the improvised fumbling of our robbers matching their lack of professionalism and adding to a tense air of unpredictability. Its quick escalation soon makes an uncomfortably tight situation downright claustrophobic. Each slow yet ever increasingly suspenseful moment adds to the last to create a bizarre stalemate that seems as though it could last for hours and yet will have one inevitable conclusion, a conclusion you don't want to happen because you've come to truly care for the perpetrators even if you know they're the ones in the wrong. Pacino gives perhaps his best performance to date and it is backed up by some phenomenally naturalistic direction, as well as brilliant supporting performances and a great (if heavily improvised upon) screenplay. It's all exciting, affecting and entertaining stuff, even at its slowest. 8/10",

It's surely among the better films of 1975. 'Dog Day Afternoon' Synopsis: A man robs a bank to pay for his lover's operation; it turns into a hostage situation and a media circus.Inspired by P.F. Kluge's article \"The Boys in the Bank\", 'Dog Day Afternoon' is an engaging cinematic experience. Frank Pierson's Screenplay is focused & always on track. However, the film definitely could've been trimmed, by at least 15-20 minutes. Lumet's Direction is Magnificent. He handles every sequence with unmatchable style. Cinematography is accurate. Editing is fair.Performance-Wise: Al Pacino delivers a performance, that can easily be credited as a 'Masterpiece'. Chris Sarandon is astonishing. John Cazale is first-rate. Charles Durning is absolutely terrific. James Broderick is very convincing. Penelope Allen is equally good. Others are perfect. On the whole, 'Dog Day Afternoon' is not Flawless, but captivating nonetheless. Watch It!",

The movie stars Al Pacino as former Vietnam vet Sonny Wortzik a bisexual who goes with his man lover Sal (John Cazale) to go rob a bank in Brooklyn, of which was originally supposed to take 10 minutes, then 4 hours later the bank becomes a news channel circus show, then 12 hours later it was the most watched event in T.V. history. Director Sidney Lumet has staged this historically accurate movie with some magnificent heist scenes that goes along with Inside Man as one of the absolute best hostage movies ever made. Not only do Pacino and Cazale do wonderful in this film but so does Charles Durning as the police sergeant who tries to negotiate with Sonny. I really have to say that this was a great film because I found the performances to be very convincing, and I personally do not hold anything against this film just because Al Pacino and John Cazale play homosexuals.",

He goes in to rob a bank with no real thought how he's going to get out with the money or if he's going to make it out alive at all. No planning. No idea how to deal with the situation. Don't have any intention of killing anybody. Don't even know why they're robbing the bank in the first place. That's what makes the film a masterpiece. Lumet and Pacino are poking fun at the Fox-TV phenom called \"America's Dumbest Criminals\" : These characters who rob banks or 7-11's, get in a bind and then turn the entire ordeal into a tragedy about their lives and their hopes and dreams...not of the people being held up at gunpoint.

            "content": "I had to watch this film for a project in my Crisis Intervention class and I am glad the professor picked this film for the assignment. Not only does he have a kick-ass personality as a professor, but seems to have good taste in movies. One of the students that saw this film said it's just a crazy movie and not worth seeing. I completely disagree and what made this film amazing and crazy in a good way is how it's all based on a true story. And just about the whole films takes place in or near a bank. This again shows you don't need huge explosions and a bunch of CGI effects to make a great movie. It has quite a bit of psychological elements that show how certain scenarios and agenda can change the perspective and thinking manner of people. It goes through 4 steps of people put into crisis and heading into crisis.1. Participating Event- The bank robbers has a agenda of making quick cash by just basically charging head first into a bank with guns. And able to make a getaway. Not the main character in this film is Sonny Wortzik played by Al Pacino who puts on a magnificent performance. Sonny is an intelligent guy that knows the system, but is delusional and lacks common sense. Which I think, they thought was equivalent to robbing a McDonalds or a liquor store. So yeah, their participating even was to just barge in take the money by threatening the workers with guns than make a quick getaway from their vehicle.2. Perception- Like I said their perception was delusional, but it also starts to get distorted as they start to dig their own grave. Which basically starts, because of smokes that start up because one of the robbers decides to burn some papers. This gets the attention of certain people outside the bank. The bank robbers, mainly Sonny's thoughts become more delusional when they get into some deep trouble by getting surrounded by cops. The robbers, well at least Sonny starts to really believe the feds will provide a plane for them to escape on. The civilians outside the banks start to think of Sonny the outlaw as a hero of some sort because of what Sonny claims to stand for. The hostages cooperates with Sonny and actually wants them to make a getaway and for the feds to provide them with what they want. Even some of the feds seemed to have some sort of sympathy for the guy. He is that much of a likable bank robber. Heck I even wanted them to make a getaway, which made the ending more tense for myself. It just shows how people's perception can change depending on the agenda and circumstances.3. Subjective Distress- Just about all the characters are dealing with some sort of distress, besides the civilians. The hostages are dealing with if they are able to make it home safely or not. However they seem to have more discomfort with the heat and the cops over being fearful of the bank robbers. I however think the bank robbers has the most distress, to the point of becoming delusional. They are facing getting buried. It's actually interesting to see how these characters that are based on real people deal with distress.4. Lowered Functioning- This is understandable since as human being deals with anxiety and stress, their function level deteriorates. The bank robbers thinking process, their tenacity and energy starts shrinking as the story progresses. It shows the psychological and physical aspects of what happens when people deal with tough situations.The situation was more danger than an opportunity. There was more danger and failure involved than success.When it comes to if the crisis was more developmental or situational. I would have to say both. Both factors come into play in this film. The characters go through situational problems, however it becomes developmental. Since the characters start to dig their own grave and it develops into more troubling matter through robber's delusions.Films or stories like this, shows no matter how much the world might have a set of principles. The cause of the matter can sometimes change the perception of others. The situation of the matter can change the perspective.When it comes to therapy in chapter 8 of \"A Guide to Crisis Intervention\" it talks about how when sometimes, actually a lot of the times when people face something they can't change no matter what. They tend to go through the bargaining stage, no matter how unrealistic it may seem. They will latch onto the thought of being able to change the matter at hand through bargaining. And that is what the robbers tried to do. I enjoy psychologically realistic films like this.This is an entertaining and at times funny film that has tension. This is a film that starts out slow, but keeps on building and building.8.4/10",

The most famous recent film about a botched bank robbery was of course 'Reservoir Dogs', but the two movie could hardly be more different (except for the use of the word 'dog' in their titles!) - Quentin Tarantino's movie was stylised, ultra-violent, and told of gangsters, whereas this movie is realist in tone and features very little shooting, while Pacino's character is essentially just a mixed-up kid. He gives a fine performance, and director Sidney Lumet shows a sure touch in handling the tragi-comic unfolding of events; the longer the movie lasts, the more involving it becomes. If anything, the film better resembles Scorcese's under-appreciated gem, 'The King of Comedy', another story about the pursuit of dreams both modest and absurd. It's among the best things that Lumet and Pacino have done in their long careers, and a welcome reminder that the greater slickness one expects in a modern blockbuster does not necessarily make a better film.",

            "content": "Based on a true story, filmed majorly in a single location & riding on the strength of its two sensational performances, Dog Day Afternoon is a firmly crafted, expertly narrated, briskly paced & accurately portrayed cinema that is much more than a robbery gone wrong story for it also tries to capture various issues prevalent in 1970s America with its anti- establishment tone.Set in Brooklyn during the early 70s, Dog Day Afternoon tells the story of a first-time crook who along with his friend decides to rob a bank but their plan goes awry from the very start when they arrive at the bank after the daily cash pickup. However, with the arrival of police, the whole scenario inadvertently turns into a hostage situation which soon escalates into an intense media circus.Fabulously directed by Sidney Lumet, this crime drama is one of the finest works of his filmmaking career & presents him at the very top of his game. The film doesn't waste much time in setting up its premise, introduces tension with fine elegance which is then steadily elevated as the story progresses to finally subside after a nail-biting finale that's far more suspenseful than most thrillers out there.Further intensifying its plot is its claustrophobic atmosphere made possible by its secluded location & tight editing. And last but not the least is the outstanding work by both Al Pacino & John Cazale. Although Pacino expresses his character's dilemma amazingly well, Cazale steals the show with a performance that's as unforgettable as it is heartbreaking. And both of them are nicely supported by the rest of the cast.On an overall scale, whether it's the direction, writing, acting, camera-work, editing or even its set pieces, Dog Day Afternoon is a work of quality in every one of these aspects and is also amongst the best works in the careers of Sidney Lumet, Al Pacino & John Cazale. Belonging to the very decade that gave us some of the greatest American films of all time, Dog Day Afternoon comes thoroughly recommended for it is a classic that simply refuses to age.",

It was, in a way, fascinating to see Al Pacino at a much younger age than the movies I have always seen him in.  And the dynamic of the crowd jeering during his scenes outside brought some energy to the film that began to interest me, but I turned it off, somewhere near three quarters of the way through the film, because frankly, it didn't entertain me enough.  I still believe in Al Pacino as a great actor, but Dog Day Afternoon left me feeling as though I had wasted my time. My advice would be that you don't waste yours on it, despite rave reviews of so many self-important critics of the classics of movies.",

            "content": "A serio-comedy can't get better than Dog Day Afternoon. At the time this movie was made, the taking of hostages for political and/or criminal reasons was a regular occurrence in the USA as well as in Western Europe (one should remember that now, in the days of \"war against terrorism\"). In 1973 the public experienced the birth of the so called \"Stockholm syndrome\"; hostages in a bank began to sympathize with their assailants. A year later, Patty Hearst was kidnapped by a group of self styled political terrorists and somehow converted into a member of that gang. I think Dog Day Afternoon was created in the light of such events \u0096 it's all the more admirable that the movie stands its own ground, reporting in a matter-of-fact way the story of a badly botched bank robbery with a hostage situation. It gives every involved character its due, but does not take sides and reports the event with a convincing faithfulness in a realistic cinematographic style.Why is this story in most parts funny \u0096 funnier in fact than many \"invented\" comedies? I think, even if it sounds strange, this is due to the sense of responsibility of people on both sides show. The \"brain\" of the robbery, a role for which Al Pacino received a n Academy Award nomination, may be stupid and disoriented, but he instinctively feels that the fates of the hostages depend on him. And he actually cares. He has to act, but has no clue how (he actually starts complaining to the hostages that he has to take care of everything!). On the other side there is the police, led by an officer played by Charles Durning \u0096 a performance that actually was equally worthy of an Oscar. He is in a similar situation and under pressure from the authorities as well as the street mob who show hostility towards the forces of order. There is a stalemate with many strange and funny situations \"written by life itself\". Until the pros step in.The behaviour of the police officers who bring the hostage situation to an end are a major asset of this movie. These are the men who enter the scene with determination and stop the comedy \u0096 which is, let's not forget, cruel and deadly dangerous. They know what their job is and how to do this job. I must say that the way they calmly analyze the situation, assess the characters of the involved, decide on a course of action and \"execute\" it is utterly convincing. As a viewer I felt that their conclusions and actions were dead right. They appear to be expert craftsmen who are not afraid to risk their own lives, and one shudders at the thought of what would happen were their expertise used improperly by those who command them.",

Sonny (Al Pacino) miscalculates in his plan and his estimation that he has a temperament for the crime. So the thwarted robbery results in a protracted hostage situation.Plenty of improvisation lends cinema verite to the narrative, which was filmed on location rather than in a studio. Also, there are moments which add little to the drama, but feel authentic---like the conversations Sonny has with his wife, his mother, and others.This is an entertaining film due to the mystery that surrounds the motivation for the robbery. And Pacino chews up the scenery like a man possessed. But there are no heroes or anti-heroes here, just a sad sack whose life is a mess, motivated by feelings of impotency and confusion, trying in desperation to make at least one person in his life (besides his adoring mother) proud.We have seen other films where real events become impromptu circuses, especially where the press shamelessly and ruthlessly intrudes. Like \"Ace in the Hole\", for example, \"Dog Day Afternoon\" demonstrates this phenomenon. It also shows how hostages can come to identify with their captors over time.",

So when I began watching Dog Day Afternoon, I knew I would not be disappointed. I laughed at parts, sympathized at others, and over all enjoyed the movie.Al Pacino stars as Sonny Wortzik, the leader and mastermind of the bank robbery that was supposed to take no more than 5 minutes. Sonny is quick-thinking and not afraid of the cops and media mounting around him.John Cazale portrays Sal, Sonny's right-hand guy. Sal is much quieter than Sonny, and possibly more volatile. Sal's history is much shadier than Sonny's.Along with the stars is a cast of a variety of side characters including Detective Eugene Moretti, the lead cop who constantly tries to trick Sonny and Sal into giving up. There's the bank manager, Mulvaney, whose only interest is the safety of his employees. There's Sylvia, a tough, leading employee who does not take abuse from Sonny and Sal. There's Sonny's \"wife\" Leon Shermer, who is panicky for Sonny's safety.With a talented cast of moderately unknown actors, Dog Day Afternoon is a moving, interesting, unique film.

The remainder of the film reveals Sonny's interactions with his hostages, the large media crowd that has gathered, and Detective Moretti who attempts to negotiate with Sonny. I think Al Pacino is exquisite in his role, revealing the truly human personality of someone who decided to disobey the law. I found it impossible to not feel sorry for Sonny's character, as he brought realness and a true New York feel to his role. This film also showed how the media can take something and create an enormous spectacle of it, to the point that even the people in danger are caught in the televised web and forget their potential danger. If you want to see Al Pacino at his prime acting career, Dog Day Afternoon should be on your list.",

I might have done if it weren't for the fact that I was alerted to it being based on a true story by someone else. It's about a bank robbery in the seventies that was carried out in broad daylight. It's safe to say that it would be a pretty bland film if everything went according to plan. However, in this case, nothing went according to plan and it was a total mess from beginning to end. That's what makes it such a damn good film (well, that and Al Pacino).\nPacino plays the lead robber (well, out of the two of them) who managed to bungle his way through raiding a bank and taking hostages at the same time. Of course his ineptitude means that the police have plenty of time to show up and Pacino is forced to hold out in the bank with little idea of how to escape a secure building surrounded by marksmen. The film clearly rests on his shoulders and, as the majority of his performances show, he can more than handle the responsibility (which is probably more than can be said for his character!). He clearly enjoyed himself on set and much of the dialogue ended up being improvised as he almost becomes institutionalised over the period of a matter of hours, before almost succumbing to the brief stint as 'minor celebrity' that his dodgy deed affords him. There are a few twists and turns which I won't go into for fear of giving plot points away, although I will say that it's an interesting commentary on the issues of the time and would be equally interesting if something like this happened today - I'm guessing plenty of #bankheists would be posted from bemused onlookers. \nIf you're in any way a fan of bank robbery/heist movies, or just a fan of Al Pacino then you really have to watch this.

But to me it's still hard to believe all of this happened. Pacino and Lumet make a great actor director combination in this dark comedy about a bank robbery gone bad.To me, crime dramas are often better when it's all taken seriously as most of the time lives are in danger. It just bothers me a bit when the crowd is chanting and cheering for Sonny when he is holding a handful of people at gunpoint. I wonder if that's exactly how it happened back in 1972. I tend to like crime films like The Town and Gone Baby Gone much more because kidnapping and murder are things that people should take seriously.Besides that, Dog Day Afternoon is a good film. The supporting cast is flawless. It was also interesting seeing Fredo and Michael Corleone in the same movie again. It's truly unfortunate that Cazale didn't live longer. Each of the five films he completed were masterpieces.

We focus on Sonny and the decisions he has to make over the 14 hour period.This is probably the best Hollywood heist story there is. No matter how many they've brought out over the years, none of them have been as thrilling and as well thought out as this. Dog Day Afternoon completely defined the Hollywood heist film. Of course, director Sidney Lumet takes liberties with the true story, but the basic facts of the event are here. Another thing that makes this movie so great is the mix between many different genres that the film goes through. There's heart wrenching drama, there's thrilling action, and there's a dab of light hearted comedy here and there.I personally think they should show this movie in high school drama classes to show what it means to be a good actor. Al Pacino gives his most realistic performance in this movie. Every other actor in the movie gives an explosive performance as well. John Cazale is great as Sonny's partner in crime, Sal.

Another part contributing to its uniqueness is that it isn't your typical heist movie- it doesn't show the robbers' being masterminds and harsh criminals, it shows them as average people who have never attempted such a thing before.It is the character of the very desperate and depressed Sonny (Al Pacino)that earns your sympathy. One thing in this movie you can't relate to is authority- you almost can't blame Sonny him for robbing the bank.The lowest point in the movie is in the end scene when he is busted and looking around at all the police happy that he was put in jail- and his partner dead, one cannot help but feel sympathy for Sonny and resent the unsympathetic authority in the movie, for not realizing he is a desperate man rather then a bad person. It is a highly disappointing scene, that crashes the enjoyment of rooting for Sonny and his partner, and hoping he gets out successfully.One other low point in the movie is when the character of Moretti is removed. This is the police officer that had all those confrontations in the movie with Sonny, and strangely disappears about 3/4s of the way in, when a more unlikable FBI character comes in which coincides with a lot of the excitement slowing down and you can see the movie goes slightly downhill.Besides these minor criticisms, \"Dog day afternoon\" remains a great film that many enjoy to this day, and rightfully has the status of a classic.",

            "content": "The 1970's have been kind to Al Pacino because that was the decade that brought him to fame. He struck gold with the Godfather films but her also starred in Serpico and now this film, Dog Day Afternoon. This film is not like you would expect. I thought this film would be a thriller/action kind of film but this is actually a comedy, and a quite funny one. This movie is well-paced, sharp, witty, and features very good acting.Sidney Lumet's film is about a guy named Sonny and his dim-witted friend who decides to hold a bank hostage in order to get an operation for his gay lover. But when this plot is discovered, he won't go down without a fight.This film is well-acted. It has a great character study and it shows wide ranges of emotions. Al Pacino is excellent and makes a serious case on why he should have won Best Actor. He has some zany energy and his role comes across as realistic. The late John Cazale is really good and has some great one-liners.Overall, this is what cinematic gold is. It's a film that is all about the characters and what they do/how they feel. Not many films analyze in-depth on their characters as Dog Day Afternoon does. Some people may not like this because they wanted hardcore action. But those who expect cinematic beauty, this is for you. I rate this film 9/10.",

In this movie we have a man who wants to rob a bank because he wants to help his lover to do an operation. But this turns into a hostage situation and a fight with media and the people.I liked this movie very much because is is based on a true incident and it was a robbery really different than the others that I have seen before that. I also liked this movie because of the interpretations of Al Pacino who played as Sonny and John Cazale who played as Sal. In addition to this I want to mention that also the direction of this movie which was made by Sidney Lumet was very well organized and this was obvious in the whole duration of the movie. This robbery is very different from all the other robberies that I have seen because we watch the robbers being in the same mental situation with the hostages and they create a bound between them.Finally I want to say that \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is a great movie that everybody should watch because it shows us and gives us many issues to think of. Also I believe that after watching this movie you will discuss about it and maybe reconsider some of your opinions about certain subjects that come out from this.",

I'm not sure I would even classify it as such.There was a lot of shouting and screaming and I do appreciate that a lot of it was deliberately ad-libbed and done very well in most places - I did like the phone conversation with Leon - all this hollering just gave me ear ache. I did like the way that the whole day was shown as hot and stuffy to depict the tension of the situation however.I'm not sure that Lumet was right when he decided not to film it as a comedy, as apparently it was one of the funniest nights the hostages had ever had and I think the ending may have been more poignant has there been more humour throughout. Although they must surely have exaggerated the over the top Police presence, even if the robbery cock ups were actually true?I won't be rushing to watch it again or necessarily recommending it to friends, but it would be a talking point as it is a true story.",

Not because it's a Stunning Film but because this something like never before. I can't say it's unique but it is something of its own kind i mean yes it is unique but not the way we define Uniqueness. And after all it's a True Story that is shaking my mind so hard that i can't get over it. In a brief, Dog Day Afternoon is about a Bank Robbery happened in 1972 and how it turned dramatic and sensational. Two guys hold hostages after Bank Robbery attempt and it turns into weird situations that catch attention of people and media. The film begins right on point for what it is made without losing any time at all. Then the dramatic conflicts take place and all of sudden entire disaster situation looks like Real and seriously intresting stuff. It has a perfect touch of comedy and that too a real funny comedy coming out of disaster situations. The screenplay deserved Academy Award as it is fantastically driven by the screenwriter. It perfectly blends all the necessary elements of any Good Film such as Comedy, Drama, Seriousness, Sense and Top Notch Climax. Well of course very much credit goes to the real incidents for that. Al Pacino looks so handsome and he plays the lead so effortlessly as it was just a daily morning walk for him. Not just him but each and every actor in the film plays the character so effortlessly. Dog Day Afternoon is like a Magnetic sphere, it attracts you and never repel until the show is over. And who creates that Magnetic field? Director Sidney Lumet. His '12 Angry Men' is one of my favourite film of all time for many reasons. And even though i didn't like his 'Network' much because of wrong ethics, Dog Day Afternoon has recuperated that loss for me. In short, Dog Day Afternoon is something you're gonna love more than any ordinary popcorn film.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest",

The feeling of the film is very grounded, as if the audience is really witnessing ordinary people suddenly caught up in a crime turned into a media frenzy, and this gives the characters plenty of familiarity.

            "content": "Several messages, actually, all of them bad.As an old-line Marxist, director Lumet is a stalwart partisan of the working class-- theoretically. Yet Bath Beach in Brooklyn, NY, an actual working class neighborhood where the movie is set, is depicted as a disorderly community of layabouts and hooligans, solidly on the side of the bank robbers, who try to keep the police from doing their job.Perhaps it is because Bath Beach is a **white** neighborhood that it is so negatively depicted by the politically correct.Not that Lumet is any friend of the forces of order, either. If the thoroughly anti-police \"Serpico\" and \"The Anderson Tapes\" didn't make this director's views clear enough, note here how the F.B.I. agents are shown as treacherous, evil men because they quickly and professionally bring to an end a dangerous situation which the local police struggled with for ten hours without a resolution. Maybe Hollywood wasn't trying to sneak in some pro-gay propaganda, but Sid Lumet certainly was. The character Sonny, sympathetically played by Lumet regular Al Pacino, neither acts nor sounds homosexual. You do not have a clue that he is gay until a good half way in the movie when the motive for the bank robbery is revealed. This subtle bias takes up the theme begun in the earlier \"Anderson Tapes\", where a prior physical relationship between the Sean Connery hero and a very young Christopher Walken is suggested.Made in the mid seventies, this picture embodies the sixties in its alienated social attitudes. See how Lumet has the all white crowd absurdly shouting \"Attica! Attica!\" to show his own sympathy for the rioting convicts at that upstate prison whose murdering of every white person they could reach, guards and fellow inmates, was ended only by police gunfire.",

The hostages are barely forced to do anything; Sonny actually cares for them - asks for food, calls for aspirines and a doctor when two of them fall ill... you really end up caring for the hostages and for the robbers, to the point where, when the 'happy end' arrives you can't help but feel bad for what happens to Sonny and Sal.Based on a true story, this movie, directed by Sidney Lumet, whose genius brought us movies such as '12 Angry Men', is the heist movie that dwarfs them all, especially because what happens on screen has actually happened, even though the names have been changed (Sonny's name was John Wojtowicz, and Leon's was Edward Aron, then Liz Eden).Al Pacino gives an outstanding performance, Chris Sarandon is very effective in his Academy Award Nominated part, and you also get a strong supporting cast in Cazale, Charles Durning (Liutenant Moretti), James Broderick (the FBI Agent in charge) and Lance Henricksen (Agent Murphy).As for the rest, the idea of not having any soundtrack except for 'Amoreena', which is the song you hear in the opening is dead on, the direction is great and everything flows in the best way.Dog Day Afternoon: 10/10.",

I loved Lumet's films he made before this that I've seen--'12 Angry Men', 'The Fugitive Kind', 'The Hill', 'The Anderson Tapes' and 'Murder on the Orient Express'--and he's superb at getting the gradual self-destruction of his characters that just seethes through the screen.At this point, Pacino could do no wrong in his work--he had that firm grasp on his immense talent and just what he needed from it to do remarkable work, some of the finest characterizations in contemporary cinema. Do both he and yourself a favour and don't bother with anything he's made since 'Heat'.",

What becomes even more stupid is the fact that Sonny easily waltz in and out of the crime scene again and again. Well, I think that would look normal since it happened in the seventies, when police procedures haven't got any set standards yet. It gets more stupid as the story ends just like that, whereas it took the police and the FBI the whole day to do it. The acting overall surely highlight Al Pacino's great and convincing acting work.

It has drama, humor, great acting, a great story, and an ending that hits you right in the gut.A few weeks from now, maybe a few months, see it again.  There is so much of what I like to call \"meat\" in this film.  It's a true story, and a compelling one, but look beneath the immediate to see what this film tells us about the culture of New York City, of America, in the early 1970s. American society was sick and rotting from the inside.  Watergate was festering, but had yet to explode into the orgy of political pus which destroyed the Nixon presidency.  Vietnam was still being fought in the jungles of Asia and on the streets of America.  Generations were clashing, and American culture and society was divided against itself.None of this context is directly provided by the film, but it is all relevant.  Look at the attitude of the mob to the whole situation.  That mob is the most fascinating character of the picture.  First, they totally support Sonny.  They make him a celebrity.  He's the classic noble outlaw. Robbing the bank, sticking it to the man, and making the police look at the same time inept, ridiculous, and utterly corrupt.  But when a shot is fired, the crowd realizes, for the first time, that their celebrity misfit criminal could be dangerous, and things begin to change.  Mulvaney, the bank manager sees it.  \"That was a foolish thing you did, back there.\"  When it is revealed, shockingly, that Sonny is a homosexual, the mob divides against itself.  A small, vocal core of homosexuals begin supporting him, while the rest of the mob, the \"mainstream\" of American society, turn viciously against him.  By the time he is escorted to the airport when the siege is over, the crowd has turned wholly against him, and the cops protect him from the public, rather than the other way around.The mob is America.  Sonny is crime.  Not just any crime, but crime born of desperation.  Sonny is an outcast from society.  He has worked all his life (so we are told), but has never been able to provide adequately for his family.  He talks frequently about the pressures he is under (and the pressures he faces on screen mirror the pressures that drove him into his predicament in the first place).  He is trapped by a hopeless, helpless urban nightmare, and he's being drowned by the expectations of wife, lover, children, parents, and society itself.  He is a Vietnam veteran, and still there is nowhere he can turn for help.So, he robs a bank and takes hostages.  Suddenly, everyone cares about him. The Establishment, suddenly, becomes terribly interested in Sonny's problems.  Oh, they despise him, to be sure, and they want him dead.  Sonny knows that.  But suddenly, he is being listened to.  Imagine what might have been if someone out there had been interested in Sonny's problems *before* he robbed the bank.Imagine that.",

            "content": "Dog Day Afternoon is a true story about two men who rob a bank in Brooklyn in 1972.Most of the heist films that I've seen are slick and well-orchestrated (think Oceans 11 or The Bank Job). However, with Dog Day Afternoon the opposite is true when we witness Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) making mistakes and being careless - such as not timing the robbery before a large sum of money has already been collected OR drawing unnecessary attention to themselves by lighting a small fire within the bank. It's evident from the start that Sonny and Sal had not really thought things through and this is what gives this film its human element.I personally think that to categorise this film as a heist film is incorrect as it probably acts more as a character study on the human mind. To me, Sonny was more misguided than bad and this becomes more evident when you look at his motivations - his reasons for robbing the bank are to help someone he loves make a life-altering decision in order to make them happy. Whilst, there's no condoning his actions I think it's easier to feel for him as a person when you learn his reasoning behind the heist.Frank Pierson's screenplay is excellent here and I think what makes this work so well is that he offers us so much insight into Sonny as a person. A good character study can only really work if you afford your character some depth - I also think it helps if both good and bad aspects of the character are represented. Here Pierson initially presents Sonny as a hard-edged character, but gradually as the film progresses we start to feel for Sonny and start to understand some of the problems that he's faced in life (the conversations that he has with his two lovers help to highlight this point). Also, despite its running time of 120 minutes, Pierson keeps things moving quickly right from the initial heist, to the negotiation with the cops, to its resolution there is not a minute wasted. It's also a relatively suspenseful and intense film that rarely loses any momentum.Pierson's screenplay is strong enough on its own, but what really brings this picture to life is Al Pacino. His performance here was terrific and although there are a couple of occasions when he perhaps goes a little overboard I think this is one of his best performances.As a side note, there was one point in the film where Sal (John Cazale) is discussing smoking with one of the hostages and he mentions that he doesn't smoke because he doesn't want to end up with cancer. In a sad twist of irony, Cazale succumbed to cancer and died 3 years after this film was made. I think this is a good point in the review to also acknowledge Cazale's performance and whilst he wasn't given as much to do as Pacino, he was still very good here in a more low-key way and Pierson also manages to handle his character with sensitivity as well.Dog Day Afternoon is a superb film that is well worth watching. Despite the fact that the story is about a bank heist, it's much deeper than that and is a film that focuses more on Sonny's reasoning behind the crime he's committed and his emotional and psychological mind-set. It's a very involving and compelling story that was excellent from start to finish.",

            "content": "Directed by Sidney Lumet and written by Frank Pierson, this film tells the apparent true story of a bank robbery that would turn into a media sensation. The movie stars Al Pacino from, of course, the Godfather trilogy, as the antihero, Sonny (who, as it turns out, is based off of the real-life bank robber, John Wojtowicz) as well as John Cazale, who was also in the Godfather films, as his partner, Sal, based off of Salvatore Naturale.Now let me start out by saying that I DID watch the trailer for this film, like two or three weeks ago (yeah, it showed many important scenes of the movie, which is why I immediately stopped watching it). But after actually viewing it, I will say that this film had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. This film has the best cinematography I have ever seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. Not only that, this has the most stable audio out of any 1970s film I've ever heard. I'd also like to add this film is loaded with f-bombs; I have not heard this many uses of them in a film from the '70s since Punishment Park.Last, but definitely not least, Pacino is, of course, the one who steals this movie. This guy gives the greatest performance I have ever seen from him, more so than, there I say it, in pretty much all of the Godfather films combined. Every single moment he was on screen, I sympathized with him to no end. To those who have not seen this film, do yourselves a favor and do just that.",

            "content": "\"Dog Day Afternoon\" asks several difficult questions about the roles celebrity, money, media and responsibility play in our everyday lives. Al Pacino puts so much into his portrayal of Sonny, the stressed-out intellectual pressed a few steps over the edge, that it's no surprise he nearly suffered a nervous breakdown on set. It's genuinely amazing how much quality characterization the filmmakers were able to fit into this regular-sized package, and not just for the lead parts. By the time Sonny, Sal and their hostages are ready to leave the confines of the bank behind, we know more intimate details about every one of them (and, perhaps, ourselves as a society) than we ever could've guessed going in. Throwing out the script and using largely improvised dialog was a key decision, transforming a film that could have easily become a thin piece of exploitation into something much more vivid and real. It does slow down quite a bit just before the climax, but in the grand scheme that only adds more tension to the rapid-fire conclusion.",

            "content": "\"Dog Day Afternoon\" is about an inept bank robbery that leads to a hostage situation. It sounds like a humorless premise, but humor is the prominent element in the film with moments of drama and tension mixed in.Al Pacino is Sonny, the leader of the heist turned hostage situation. Pacino is perfect in his role as a nervous improviser. His character is multi-faceted and interesting, proving sometimes knowledgeable despite being engaged in an inept operation and sympathetic. John Cazale is also notable as the accomplice of few words, Sal. Cazale is at his best with his expressions during the tense final sequence. The hostages and police forces are well-played as well. It was interesting to contrast the styles of Moretti, initially representing the police side and trying to cobble a solution together and Sheldon, the organized chess-master FBI agent.On paper the hostage situation story sounds typical, but this film rises far above any clich\u00e9s. The film gains strength from its humoristic approach to the situation, which uses irony and absurdity to great effect. However, there are a number of great dramatic moments as well and an interesting consideration of Vietnam, trans-sexuality and other social issues. I found that after the initial hold-up gone wrong I slowly calmed to the hostage situation before the effective and tense end sequence. I didn't find the film's second half aside from the ending to be as consistently engaging as the first, but overall this film has a novel and interesting approach to portraying a hostage situation.",

And I really haven't seen too many better ones in the succeeding thirty years. Pacino was still relatively fresh in the eyes of the American public, as we (and when I say \"we\", I'm speaking for the U.S. audiences of 1975---I caught up with his earlier work later on through the wonder of VHS) had only witnessed his cooler & less manic acting performances of SERPICO & the two GODFATHERS. But he was allowed to cut loose here, and cut loose he did. It's pretty much a non-stop roller-coaster ride of emotions as the DOG DAY unfolds.John Cazale (who will always remind me of Mike Krzyzewski {\"Coach K.} from Duke U.) does a fine job in his own understated, 'psychoish' way. But this is really Al's show, and he doesn't disappoint. So pull up a chair and watch \"The Midget\" (as he's referred to in Robert Evans' autobio.) at the top of his game.",

            "content": "Sidney Lumet, the legendary director of 12 Angry Men and Network, is operating at the upper echelon of his ability in Dog Day Afternoon. Based on a true story of a bank hostage situation gone incredibly wrong, this film shows us that \"anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.\" This film is brilliantly conceived with much of the brilliance stemming from the sheer quirkiness displayed at every turn. The script (which earned Frank Pierson an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay) is extraordinarily nuanced and brought to life by many electric performances from its cast.Al Pacino is magnificent as Sonny Wortzik, the inexperienced, bumbling criminal. He absolutely throws himself into Sonny's mind and perfectly captures even the smaller mannerisms and body language that likely go unnoticed by many. His wired eyes sharply contrast his physical state of exhaustion and you physically observe the fatigue both Pacino and his character are enduring throughout this film. Ultimately, you feel for Sonny because Pacino is able to masterfully force his vulnerability and compassion - the humanistic side of him - into some semblance of bravado. In scenes like when a teller needs to go to the washroom or when the bank guard has an asthma attack, Sonny shows a genuinely caring side to him. This is a bad man performing an act of evil and, yet, we feel some degree of sympathy for what Sonny has endured until this point. Along for the heist is Sal (played by John Cazale), who regrets his involvement in it all the second the two step foot into the bank. The man was simply excellent in every film he was in.Overall, this film is a masterpiece from a director who was always so deft at using the camera to feel like a kind of onlooker; as it subtly observes the events unfolding before it, we too are immersed into the story and thus given a more tangible, relatable story. Like in 12 Angry Men, we are not a moviegoer; but rather a silent bystander enduring the tense, overheated conditions with its characters. And of course, further life is breathed into the plot by excellent supporting performances including those from Charles Durning, Chris Surandon and James Broderick. An entertaining and perfectly executed story.",

This is unlike a bank robbery you have ever seen and years before numerous directors made films about bank robberies. Pacino and John Cazale hit this film out of the park. Their stellar performances make this film iconic, I am not sure if any other actors could have had the same impact. Essentially we see a bank robbery that is badly planned turn into a media circus. After seeing the unstable and excited personalities of Pacino we understand why. For a film that escalates and a situation that increasingly grows out of control it flows perfectly. You are carefully taken through a chain of events. The humor is also brilliantly done and also flows effortlessly as to not take away the drama and intensity of the robbery. The unplanned robbery, virtually no money being robbed and the unlikely bonding with their captors endears the bank robbers to the audience. You want them to succeed and possibly root for their escape. Despite the circus and things going out of control it appears the duo will succeed as the film nears its end. The film also delivered some shocking moments. I had the same expression as Al Pacino's character at the end of the film. Al Pacino steals the show with his fits of rage, expressions and always being on the edge. This film is highly recommended, 8.5/10",

            "content": "I rented this movie based on Pacino's other works. I was born 1980 and could never relate to the feelings that surrounded this film (screaming \"Attica\" and the references to Vietnam) except for the universal feel of greed and desperation.Al Pacino played a perfect bank robber and over-the-top salesman to the detectives who started to surround the bank that he was taking over with his partner in crime, Sal. From the first move, everything about their operations goes haywire. First, their wingman flees, saying he can't go through with it and crying. Just great. Then the tellers sound the silent alarm, and everything after wards is almost comical at what an amateur bank robber he is. Sal is basically the silent type and hardly has anything to add to anything during the heist. The rest of movie follows this formula, including a wife that gets on Pacino's back, a crazy talkative mother, and \"cons\" who keep trying to throw Pacino's character off the subject to getting a plane for him and his hostages (and Sal) to go to Algeria. (Why Algeria?) The story was great and the screenplay was even better. The grainy look of the 70's film showed through, but it works because it's based on a story back in 1972. It is a little dated, as stated before, which kind of hurts newer audiences of Pacino's classic works, only because the references are not quite as clear. There was no music at all during this film, and everything seemed to be shot on a very tight budget, using only one back-lot and maybe the most expensive shot of the airplane tarmac. I doubt that any extras got paid, either (except maybe the ones who got closeups).I gave it a 7/10. It is a great Pacino film, but not as great as others. He acts superbly without any resistance to his anger or sadness or whatever other feeling should overcome any a bank robber. I loved the moment when he dictates his last will and testament, almost knowing that he's definitely going to die or be put away for a really long time. Also his reactions to his wife's constant stream of questioning and confusion were classic. And of course, Attica Attica Attica.",

But there is a reason, why Sonny robbed the bank and it is for his lover/wife (Chris Sarandon) to have the sex change operation. Amazingly enough, this is based on a true story.Directed by Sidney Lumet (Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, Network, Serpico) made an highly entertaining, dark crime comedy with some drama and amusing sense of humour. Pacino is terrific is his Oscar nominated performance, he brings life to this movie. The late Cazale is also very good as the simple-minded criminal.

Frank Pierson, who wrote the original screenplay won an Oscar for his excellent work. The movie was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Al Pacino, Best Supporting Actor for Chris Sarandon and Best Film Editing.\"Dog Day Afternoon\" manages to be an classic, since it's original release in 1975.

Elton John's \"Amoreena\" is the only song that plays during the entire film, and it is played over this montage of Brooklyn to set a casual tone that is upset by the sudden enacting of a bank robbery. At first it is startling as Sal pulls his gun out on the manager of the bank and Sonny frantically lines everyone up on the wall, threatening them with his rifle, but soon enough it isn't hard to tell he didn't plan much out, as one of the members of his gang of three quickly runs off afraid, leaving just Sonny and Sal. Then, mostly through his own ineptitude, Sonny accidentally attracts the attention of a man across the street and soon enough the police are surrounding the bank, along with a crowd of bored bystanders that watch the event as if it were entertainment meant for them.Soon the media gets a hold of this story and people begin treating Sonny like a celebrity and everything he says is given more importance, with people either viewing him as a people's champion or an evil villain, shifting their perception of him to fit their view of the world, idolizing him even when he doesn't want it. But by bringing us inside the bank, this film allows us to see Sonny and Sal as the scared, desperate, genuine human beings they were. We learn that despite the extreme measures these people are ultimately trying to help who they think needs it, even insinuating both Sal and Sonny may be suffering from their experience in the war. That doesn't make them good people, but the fact that their robbing a bank also doesn't make them bad people, and it is so much easier to sympathize with Sonny due to Al Pacino's fantastic performance, showcasing all of Sonny's fear, doubt, anxiety, and hope during this ordeal. John Cazale brings a surprising amount of deadpan humor to Sal while never feeling like it is betraying the realism of the film. For that matter, all of the performances in this film pull you deeper into it, to the point where you can almost forget your watching a movie and not the real people involved in this event.Despite taking place almost entirely in one location, the film is far more visually interesting than many films that I have seen that take place in a plethora of places. Lumet rarely resorts to the standard and boring shot/reverse shot when shooting conversations, often keeping the camera mobile (even if its subtle movement), blocking the scenes to show the relationship between characters at that moment, and occasionally having multiple stories being told on screen at once.Yet, although the film never feels overtly cinematic, in the end I began to root for Sonny and Sal, and began to build expectations based on my sympathy for this character, but, just like those who saw him on their television at home, we forgot that this was a true story and not happening as a fantasy, and once he leaves the cameras, the reality of the situation hits him and us rather suddenly.",

O-kay, so I'm being a little overly dramatic about this movie, but it is extremely intense. Although the whole thing is good, what makes it so extraordinary is the last two or three minutes when you see weather they make it..... or don't!

The robbery was supposed to have taken just ten minutes, but one thing leads to another and the heist becomes a media sensation. Sonny and Sal demand for them to be taken to Canada on a plane so nothing bad can happen to them.I would call Sonny Pacino's third best character after Frank Serpico and Michael Corleone.

            "content": "Dog Day Afternoon is the story of Sonny an incompetent bank robber and his partner Sal as they bungle their way through their first heist to an ultimately tragic conclusion.Pacino is at his best in this film in a career filled with legendary performances (The Godfather, Serpico etc) this ranks for me as his best. Some how from the outset he makes us feel sympathy for Sonny who more than likely isn't actually a very nice guy (he is after all robbing a bank!). Backed up by by a similarly excellent performance by John Cazale (a tragedy he died at 43 leaving only five performances on film) as Sal his un-stable partner. Veteran Charles Durning is perfect for the role of the in over his head Policeman who has to deal with the media storm as well as the hostage situation.As the heist spirals out of control all involved lose the plot with the highlight being the arrival of Sonny's 'wife' to the scene. It's then we find out his true motivation and how his struggle to break free from the everyday mundane life he leads has lead him to such a drastic course of action.Direction and script are superb with everything just right always serious in tone but there are moments of laugh out loud madness. That it's based on a true story makes it's emotional punch even stronger.Entertaining, involving and thought provoking everything a serious movie should be 9/10",

As to his partner, Sal,it's interesting how Cazale managed to create such a blend of vulnerability, sadness and innocence into a 'ticking bomb' bank robber with a criminal record. Leon is another memorable character, played to perfection by Chris Sarandon. The mother, along with the wife, gives a better understanding of the circumstances in which Sonny snapped. Anyone would go nuts with those two women around. The only intelligent character in this movie is Lance Henriksen's, another amazing, under-rated actor. He has a small part here, but it's a pivotal role. Sharp, slick, precise. His eyes speak volumes. The critique of the media is sharp and darkly funny. All the actors are doing a great job, and the spirit of the era is well captured.",

            "content": "The opening montage of New York City scenes on a hot summer's day quickly establishes time and place. On that hot summer day Sonny, Sal, and Stevie decide to rob a small Brooklyn bank. When Sal (John Cazale) walks into a bank, pulls an automatic weapon from his attach\u00e9 case and points it at the bank manager, you think that this is going to be just another heist movie, but it quickly turns into something quite different. The first hint we get of this is when Stevie starts getting \"bad vibes.\" When Sonny argues with him that the crime is already underway, but Stevie leaves the scene, you realize then that these three guys are complete amateurs.What sets this movie apart from other heist movies is that it really isn't about the robbery, it's about the characters, mainly Sonny and Sal. Sonny is presented as a complex person. He can be kind-hearted, on the one hand, worrying about whether his hostages are hungry for example, but on the other hand he can explode in anger. His reason for the robbery was to fund a sex change operation for his homosexual lover. And, oh, Sonny is also married with children. Getting to know Sal is a different matter. Cazale plays him as a withdrawn loner who could easily kill without remorse. The FBI quickly sizes up the situation, tagging Sonny as someone they could probably deal with, but recognizing Sal as a true menace. Absent Sal this movie could almost be seen as a satiric comedy; with Sal, a dark cloud hangs over the proceedings.The movie offers some searing commentary on the media and its effect on behavior. During the course of the day television stations are on the ground and in the air with almost continuous coverage. The accounting of the effect the media has on behavior is perceptive. Sonny gets a charge from playing to the crowds and being on TV and being paid attention to. The crows are more than happy to participate in the spectacle and the hostages are so taken with having their fifteen minutes of fame that one woman did not even take the opportunity to escape when she had the chance. Sad to say that in the decades since this movie was made, things have only gotten worse with personal interest stories and personalities dominating the news cycles. So, the social behaviors pointed out are so well established by 2011 that this movie is dated in that respect.The opening text stating that this is a true story is misleading; it is not a documentary. For example, in the real event Sal was a volatile eighteen year old. \"Based on a true story\" would be a more accurate description.Some scenes stretched my belief. Would Sonny actually give his gun over to a hostage and try to teach her how to present arms? Would the dangerous Sal be so easily convinced to point his weapon away from the FBI agent driving the limo?",

            "content": "Seventies classic \"Dog Day Afternoon\" recounts the true story of a failed bank robbery that took place in Brooklyn on August 22, 1972. Small-time crooks Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) & Sal Naturile (John Cazale) get caught in the act and end up taking the bank's employees hostage. As the situation builds to a media frenzy Sonny tries to bargain with the authorities, who have their own ideas about ending the standoff.Unsurprisingly, the script deviates from fact somewhat but it still maintains a sense of authenticity. The real-life Sonny was already an intriguing character and the commotion surrounding the event makes for compelling cinema. Screenwriter Frank Pierson ended up taking home the Oscar for best original screenplay, though I'm not sure why it wasn't in the adapted screenplay category since the story was based on a Life magazine article. In any case, the film was a deserving winner.As for the acting, Al Pacino delivered one of the best performances of his career and was justly rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Chris Sarandon snagged another well-deserved nomination in support while John Cazale and Charles Durning also turned in standout supporting performances. Meanwhile, the remainder of the cast is consistently dependable.Sidney Lumet's Oscar-nominated direction is, in a word, impressive. Most of the action is tied to one location but he keeps the narrative flowing with a documentary-style approach. Editor Dede Allen (who also received an Oscar nomination) also deserves credit for this. Musically, the film is pretty sparse, featuring an Elton John tune over the opening credits and little (if anything) else besides. However, this relative lack of music suits the picture.In conclusion, \"Dog Day Afternoon\" grabs the viewer's attention early on and doesn't let go until the closing scene. The fine writing, acting and direction made it worthy of its Best Picture Oscar nomination in 1975 and it remains as vibrant today as it was thirty-six years ago.",

The bank robbers actually do watch TV while in the bank so the perspective stays intact.Practically all characters in the story are way beyond people I would ever know so I cannot comment on the actor's performance here.

            "content": "Initially, we believe Sonny is an accomplished and capable criminal. He knows all the tricks of the trade that the tellers employ. There's humour in the way he dismissively scatters the decoy bills, as if he has done this a hundred times and is sick of all the charades. Pacino's character is a great mystery and intimacy at once. His bravado persona is played up for the crowd and all the media scrutiny that accompanies the stakeout. His jaded, weary dialogue reflects a criminal who has seen all that the cops throw at you. When they try to ambush him from the back entrance, he becomes utterly incredulous that they would be so disrespectful and not take his criminal aspirations seriously. Again and again he reminds everyone that he holds the hostages, and therefore the power. Then the facade begins to slowly crack, and he has trouble believing it himself. John Wojtowicz, who the character is based upon, watched The Godfather right before holding up the Chase Manhattan branch. Did Sonny also do the same before attempting his first career crime, hoping that it would inspire a personality that screamed, \"Don't mess with me\"? When this part of Sonny peels away, we begin to see the man he truly is underneath. The Catholic in him does not want anyone to get hurt, but to make it a quick and painless job. The bank's manager, Mulvaney, agrees. Boyar plays a great natural role within the bustle of New York City. There are many a people like Mulvaney, who are thinking of their families, and who can instantly see through Sonny's charade and believe that he does not mean to harm anyone. This allows them to chastise and laugh at his lack of preparation only moments after he storms in guns aloft. The NYC influence also allows the crowd to see Sonny as one of their own, revolting against the system, and rally around his cries and stunts. It allows for the delivery boy's moment of stardom, which would mar the tension of any conventional crime thriller set elsewhere, to be a brilliant addition to Lumet's little satirical jabs. The magic of Dog Day Afternoon is in how cleverly and subtly it conceals its act of shifting moralities. At first we fear for the innocent hostages' lives. We see a crazed criminal who is not afraid to use his gun, and has little patience for tricks or holdups. We are like Mulvaney, edging slowly and carefully, hoping to resolve this without bloodshed. By the end of the film the oddball group has miraculously become a dysfunctional family. When Maria is let go as part of the bargain, she cries out in relief, half sobbing, half laughing. And then she turns and says something that would be, again, completely out of place in another film: \"Sal, 'cause this is your first plane trip, don't be scared, okay?\" And she hands over her rosary beads too. When did this relationship develop? When did they have this heart-to-heart talk? When did the dynamic cease to be kidnapper-hostage? Was it when Sylvia, instead of walking straight to freedom, gave a wave to the cameras and returned to accompany her girls? Or when Sonny ensures that the asthmatic guard and diabetic Mulvaney get the treatment they need? At the start of the film we are hoping no innocent blood will be shed. By the end of it, these innocents are part of the crusade themselves, and we have been positioned like the community, clenching our hands together and hoping that the gang make it on their plane and fly away to safety. The crowd is fickle, of course. They waver when they discover Sonny's bisexuality - even though he is only doing it to pay for his wife's gender re-assignment. Lumet has so carefully tread the line here. Leon is not made an easy target for the masses, or a lazy stereotype. His nails may be done and his voice a little high-pitched as his nerves flare up, but the most important thing is that he is in pain. There is a wonderful, loving, stormy and hurting relationship here between the lines. No doubt something has happened, and it has torn them apart, but the love burns strongly afterwards, so much so that Sonny has decided to rob a bank when he has been a good Catholic all his life. The phone-call is heart-wrenching. Another smaller scene is the same. Leon has been dragged in from a psychiatric hospital to be harshly interrogated by a horde of policemen. When he admits he feels like a woman in a man's body, a cop in the background who has been holding in his laugh cannot smother it any longer and lets it out. Leon's reaction is not even anger, or outrage. We understand this is a usual reaction he endures everyday. It is simply sad resignation. Another tragic character is Sal, who is pushed to one side by the stage-stealing Sonny. Cazale is silent, forlorn, timid. Like Sonny he does not feel comfortable about robbing a bank, only he is not equipped with the shouting skills to pretend otherwise. He simply closes in on himself and curls away into a corner, internalising. He exchanges small talk with the tellers, who are ironically much more relaxed and cheerful than him. He refuses a smoke: his body is a temple. Oddly enough, his body throughout the film is sweating furiously, visualising all the stress for him. Are these bad people, or simply people who have hit a dead end and find themselves with no other choice? We might not be driven to the same ends, but we agree with their frustrations. They are so human and painfully drawn that we feel for them. Some rob a bank. Other kick a chair, or throw a plate, or a punch. We can channel it elsewhere in our lives, and find we are not so different.",

            "content": "The robbery should have taken 10 minutes. 4 hours later, the bank was like a circus sideshow. 8 hours later, it was the hottest thing on live TV. 12 hours later, it was all history. And it's all true.This tagline says it all perfectly. In 1972 a bisexual man robbed a bank to pay for his gay lover's sex change. It should have gone smooth and simple but exploded into a media extravaganza that ended up taking twelve hours to get sorted out, just as the tagline states. Dog Day Afternoon is the film that came out of these events. Al Pacino plays Sonny Wortzik, the man robbing the bank with his friend Sal, played by the late and great John Cazale. The entirety of the movie is set during the robbery with no setup of the characters or backstory. Everything we need to know unfolds amidst the action. The movie is tremendous in its claustrophobic and limited setting in a small bank on a New York street corner.Al Pacino is the shining star of this film. He plays his character to perfection, and is absolutely fascinating and exciting to watch. I couldn't see anyone in this role except for the vulgar and fast talking Pacino. John Cazale as Sal is also an excellent casting decision, despite the fact he has few lines in the film. But what he does for the film is eerily excellent. Sal remains at a level of high strung paranoia the entire film, restoring its harrowing attitude when it starts to dwindle. Other major players include Charles Durning as the police chief who tries to subtly out wit Sonny throughout the movie, maintaining his calm and collected attitude so as not to stir up any unnecessary excitement from his armed counterpart. Chris Sarandon plays Leon, Sonny's gay lover who appears in one of the most intimate and sincere scenes of the entire film. Every bit of his scene had my eyes glued to the screen. It was one of the many places we got to see the different intensity levels of Sonny, who was loud and frightening in some scenes, then calm and sentimental in others. It all added to his perfect characterization.The entire cast of the bank, which includes the bank manager and a number of female bank tellers also do a fantastic job at driving the intimate character interaction at the heart of this film. Their response to the bank robbery is complete and utter cooperation, so as to protect their own lives. But as media attention grows around the robbery, they seize the opportunity for their own 15 minutes of fame, and even end up befriending Sonny who doesn't want to hurt anybody, he just wants money. It's a fascinating study of human interaction under extreme pressure that bares some interesting and even comical results when we see how the friendly relationship unfolds between Sonny and the teller girls. Then of course we see the reaction of the outside to this situation. Sonny becomes an instant draw of attention for anybody looking for some good reality television on a hot summer day in New York. But more interestingly, he even molds into a hero to the anti law enforcement advocates in the city who come to the robbery scene and cheer him on. People with all sorts of opposing opinions come to watch this robbery unfold, and it makes for a brilliantly played out character study.Fascinatingly enough, Dog Day Afternoon covers a lot of societal ground for being such a limited plot and setting. It deals with law enforcement influence, mainstream media and its effects on society, and even gay rights. The reveal that this tough bank robber is gay stirs up so much confusion in the accumulated crowd. There are people who immediately turn against Sonny when they learn this, but he also then inspires a whole other community, those who support gay rights and transexuality. As the movie unfolds Sonny's stardom branches to so many places, and the way we see him deal with it all is incredible, due to the fact that he is still worrying about how to get away with this bank robbery.Despite its limited resources, this movie stays very exciting the entire way through, and it was one of those movies where I was so drawn in by everything that was happening that I never wanted it to end. The film stems across so many different genres, and it all flows together so seamlessly. It begins as a typical heist film and develops into a smart crime thriller with some bits of comedy splashed in there, but never overplayed or forced. It then morphs into a deeply emotional drama at points as well as a sentimental and highly unconventional romance. It is amazing how well this blend of genres works in perfect motion together with no aspect of the film becoming overbearing. Everything comes together exquisitely, and I enjoy it all anymore.Dog Day Afternoon works as a character study, a crime thriller, and a drama. It is a fascinating story that covers so much ground, but doesn't force feed any one idea to you. Lumet stays respectful to the story he is telling by making it an exciting and thrilling story that focuses so well and so strongly on the development of Sonny, who no one could have played as excellently as Al Pacino. This movie has become one of my new favorites.",

Fast forward to three years later when a film inspired by the events took place (albeit with creative liberties) entitled Dog Day Afternoon, starring Al Pacino and John Cazale as the main robbers and directed by acclaimed dramatic filmmaker Sidney Lumet, and the result was a critical and commercial darling. To this day, the film remains culturally and historically significant for its anti-authoritarian take on the establishment, as well as its LGBTQ themes.The film follows an amateur crook named Sonny Wortzik (Pacino) and his friend Sal Naturile (Cazale) as they attempt to rob a bank and run out with all the money. Unfortunately, everything that could possibly go wrong goes haywire as their heist generates enough buzz to bring in multiple voices on the scene. With the scenario of a bank robbery going from bad to worse in a matter of one day, the film becomes quite a gripping case of survival of the thickest (brain wise). Given how many people end up being involved in this disaster, from the held hostages inside the bank to the police to even familial acquaintances of Sonny himself, the tone can get very paranoid and anxiety-inducing in the blink of an eye. The lack of experience Sonny and Sal have in robberies is shown through hysterical banter between them and their held captives, aided by some appropriately stressed performances from Pacino and Cazale from their facial expressions alone. More often than not, when a failed heist occurs, the most relatable aspect is seeing the tension rise from those who started it in the first place.As for what kinds of obstacles our antiheroes have to face, the police and relatives of Sonny make one wonder who the real antagonists are supposed to be. While the cops represent the moral conflict that will come from attempting such a big crime, they also reflect the scapegoats and monsters common in the grander scheme of societal realism and economic decline, which is both applauded and ranted on ih the film. Given the dire situation Sonny and Sal end up in out of their other personal problems, they are seen as both icons for the anti-establishment rebels and devils for how low they would sink just to help themselves out. The held hostages themselves are hilarious examples of both sides, in which they only interact with the robbers out of their own will while also understanding the pain and torment they're all going through. It doesn't help that the people Sonny knows personally, from his estranged wife to his transitioning partner, are all suffering in their own way and they count on Wortzik to actually do what's right for once. Conflict over resolution is all that comes up.On an added note, the choice to not have a score accompany the feature was a brilliant choice on the filmmaker's part to allow the story to speak for itself. Where most heist capers today would have even their quietest scenes have some unneeded background music or even some catchy jazz song played here and there, this film respects its audience enough to follow the storyline concisely; it also adds to the crazy tension as well. Although the editing is pretty routine for the type of heist flick this is, it can occasionally become quick paced and sporadic to aid a given scene with tons of craziness happening all around. On a side note, the added addition of news reported videography makes the film feel far more accurate than it already is, displaying what the untrained viewer at home might witness instead of the people witnessing the event live. While there are a lot more highly intense crime thrillers out there with a heavier emphasis on the editing and action, this film is secure enough in its presentation to let the case play on its own and leave it up for viewer interpretation.With a strong blend of the horrid reality and relatable characters, Dog Day Afternoon deserves all the recognition and acclaim it's received. After almost 50 years in the spotlight, the film remains a staple of modern tensions over law, media, society and even sexuality, and it might be one of the quintessential Pacino flicks out there as well. If you're yet to check it out, by all means give it a watch, but understand that what you're getting into is a cinematic classic less for its filmmaking ambitions and more so for its social commentary. In today's era of anti-establishment rebellion, this film has aged like fine wine.",

The opening Elton John music--perfect to help set the mood, which is the only time there is \"background music\" so that the effect is like watching a real-time documentary with hidden cameras. Theacting--what acting?? The characters all feel so real and so perfectly drawn from the tour de force of Pacino's Sonny to the unbelievably intriguing Cazale's Sal (what a tragic, tragic shame that his acting career was cut short--but he sure left us with some of the most memorable characters in the history of American Film) to all of the \"bit\" players, each a living breathing recognizable person. The New York feel to the film is perfect. The directing of Lumet is just astonishing. As has been commented on--we feel that we are experiencing each and everymoment of this hostage scenario--to the extent that by the end of it we are also exhausted, hungry and sort of in an altered state. Much of the film is like a roller-coaster ride--we do a lot of laughing, and watch the story unfold inamazement--and then that look on Sonny's face in the airport , filled with so much anguish, that the film also becomes incredibly poignant. Have a great,rollicking time--and see this absolutely top-notch film.",

I thought reinacting Dog Day Afternoon was a great idea because it shows how nice they were about stealing the money but it all went wrong when one person saw what was happening and then everyone knew about it. It's a great story to show in a movie and I thought the movie was fantastic. Al Pacino is one of the best actors who ever lived. He got most of his reputation from the Godfather Saga even though he never won an award for the Godfather but there were a lot of other movies that he was in the deserves recognition like Serpico, Scent of a Woman (Academy Award Winner) and Insomnia. But I think Dog Day Afternoon was one of his best ACTING movies he was ever in. Overall, I think this movie was fantastic and I recommend this movie to all viewers who like Al Pacino and like very interesting storylines. I give Dog Day Afternoon TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!",

            "review_title": "Hot",
            "content": "This film is fantastic. Al Pacino is Sonny, a young punk who decides one hot afternoon to rob a bank with his friend Sal so that he can pay for his lover's sex change operation. What begins as a simple plan to walk in, get the cash and walk out in ten minutes turns into a desperate battle for survival as the cops turn up and the whole thing turns into a hostage situation. There's hardly any cash in the vault anyway as Sonny is given the wrong information, and if that's not disappointing enough, there's a load of irritating women employees and a manager who appear to add tension to the situation by occasionally revealing how much they hate these thieves and making a mockery of their plan. Yet as the film goes on the hostages do begin to sympathise with why they decided to rob their bank and the tension subsides somewhat although the mood is still kept to nerve snapping effect. As the cops move in using family members and other tactics to draw them out you feel that time is running out, and that the chance of the robbers getting away is about a million to one. In their final bid to escape, by holding the hostages at gunpoint and demanding a jet out of the country, it turns to tragedy. How you ask? well I suggest you buy it or tape it or both, heck it's such a good film it's worth it.The tension is excruciating and Pacino is on unbelievable form as the man facing the prison doors or his grave, the mood created by Sidney Lumet is spectacular and the only reason it gets a 9 is because it simply is not as good entertainment as say, Taxi Driver, The Silence of the Lambs or The Godfather. It is no doubt a very good film and I could watch it over and over again, but it does not get a 10. Yet I expect many would give it ten, and they may be right. I can only suggest that you watch this very unique film, that is based on the true event of a New York bank robbery on August 22nd 1972. And I can honestly say you will love it.",

            "content": "Dog Day Afternoon is the kind of movie to showcase how everything that is supposed to go according to plan doesn't, and just gets messier.From a writing p.o.v, it's wise and justified to stuck the protagonist and challenge him during his journey. In case of the film, Sonny (Al Pacino) is dealing with a bank robbery that goes wrong and must control the situation all by himself. Thus dealing with challenges in his journey.The thing is that Sonny isn't a bad person, he's just a man who's a bit lost with his life, he's married and has two kids, he's also married to a transsexual person. He needs to afford money for himself and many around him, so obviously he would lose his mind and try something daring such as a heist.Although still with everything Sonny does during the movie it just didn't make me emphasize with him. When I compare this movie to John Q (starring Denzel Washington) than I find myself emphasize more with John Q and his actions, he means no harm to anybody. Unlike Sonny and Sal who are dangerous and immature.While I did enjoy the acting of many of the cast members, I wasn't attached to the story. Sure it may be inspired by true events and is supposed to stick to the material but throughout the movie I didn't really enjoy the story, I felt disconnected from everything.So in terms of screenplay, the writers did a good job of challenging the protagonist during his arc, his journey. But in terms of joy and empathy, the movie struggled less to nothing on that perspective.",

            "content": "I believe this movie is what you call a \"sleeper\". It is not a hugely popular movie (i.e. it's not played verbatim on cable) but it is a moving, if not humorous, film.The main reason why I enjoyed it was the relatively small cast of characters. There was Pacino, brilliant as always, his co-horts, the hostages and several members of the police squad. Granted, the streets become filled with onlookers, but they are extras-we do not know any of them personally. A small cast makes for less confusion and more attention is paid to the core story.John Cazale, who was previously scene with Pacino in \"The Godfather\" and later with Robert DeNiro in \"The Deer Hunter\" is wonderful in his role of the troubled and nervous bank robber, Sal. Poor, poor Sal. Mr. Cazale was a gifted actor and it is a shame that this one was one of his last movies. But it's probably also one of his finest.Al Pacino, a terribly gifted actor, turns in another stellar performance, riding high off the success of the \"Godfather\" movies from the previous 4 years. He is constantly under pressure, nervous, confused, but very believeable, sometimes humorous. The scene in which he screams \"Attica! Attica!\" at the police is the most moving moment in the film and also one of the most powerful scenes in all of cinema history.Do yourself a favor and sit down with this movie. The story line will capture you from the moment you start watching. No time is wasted on preliminary scenes or planning. You start watching and Boom!, there you are, in the middle of it all. The film will take you on a ride of emotions and feelings and will not let you off until the credits start to role. Then, you will be utterly stunned at what you have seen.",

In his head the plan was simple, he and his other two accomplices were going to go in and walk out with a cool stash but his plan got a bit murky.

Pacino is excellent as the anti-hero who loses control of the action and sees everything spiralling out of control. The direction by Sidney Lumet is focused and spot on - there are only one or two scenes that are not set within the bank or its immediate vicinity. My only complaint is that especuially in the middle third of the film the action moves slowly. Very slowly. Other than that, this is a great film.",

            "review_title": "Chiseling and Involving",
            "content": "Not much is explained about the bank robbery in Dog Day Afternoon at the picture's start. All the information we're given are the thieve's names and the dialogue exchanges they release to their captives. What's interesting is how connected we feel to the characters being held captive in the bank, the police trying to extinguish the situation, and the publicity outside. It's like we're one of the townspeople watching in the background or one of the tellers in the bank. We're put directly in the middle of the catastrophe and learn Sonny's motivations at the same time as the characters themselves them. Uniquely, we almost believe we are apart of this grand heist. We feel Sonny's humanity, despite the situation at hand. Dog Day Afternoon tells us what we're about to see is an accurate depiction of these events that took place in New York City before the action of the movie begins. Once that idea was placed in my head, the more I felt like I was watching an event, not a movie. Director Sidney Lumet blurs the lines of cinema and journalistic news reporting. The film doesn't play as one or the other, instead it's a more involving experience. The screenplay brilliantly recounts the events and shapes together a suffocating and chiseling incident. Dog Day Afternoon accounts the amateur plans and actions of the characters realistically. It's a special film that taps on different parts of our mind and interest. Al Pacino is the movie. He's in nearly every scene and commands the screen with his flawed, compassionate, warped character. Pacino attacks the character from the right approach. Sonny thinks he has everything under control, but he doesn't know or think he looks ridiculous or inexperienced. As the movie grows, the more we learn of Sonny and we see Pacino's portrayal growing and growing. The film finally arrives Sonny's character climax in a lengthy scene where Sonny speaks on the telephone. In that scene, Pacino reaches new levels of intensity that he only scraped the surface of in the Godfather trilogy. The film contains little musical score, which works to its advantage. A musical score exists to aid the actors in expressing what the characters are feeling. In Dog Day Afternoon, we're watching a \"common man\" robbing a bank, it's a representation of a real-life event. Thanks to the cutting directing, involved writing, and absorbing acting, there's no need to force the audiences hand to understand the story. The film even boldly tackles issues of homosexuality with poise. Holding your attention, Dog Day Afternoon recounts the event probably better than it was played out in real-life.

            "content": "What a great movie! Visiting it again after a near forty-year gap, I'm astounded how well it stands up, in spite of it being so firmly rooted in the 1970s. It's definitely one of the top NYC pictures: the opening sequence captures the city in many moods and places before homing in on a Brooklyn bank, scene of a botched robbery by Sonny (Pacino) and Sal (Cazale). What follows is constantly engaging.One of the many fascinating things about DOG DAY AFTERNOON is the quality of the acting, both on an individual and collective level. Pacino is extraordinary as Sonny. Gentle and angry, crazy and lucid, a volatile pack of explosives threatening to detonate at any moment. But he is given rock-solid support from Cazale, Durning (amazing), James Broderick, Chris Sarandon, and the entire ensemble of bank hostages led by terrific Penelope Allen. The only cast member who doesn't score a bullseye is Judith Malina as Pacino's mother: there's something not quite right about her big scene, though I can't put my finger on what. It needed Lee Grant, or Estelle Parsons. But it's a tiny cavil. A work of art doesn't need to be perfect to be great. The two rarely go together, in my experience.The camera work ranges effortlessly over documentary-style helicopter shots over the city to classic claustrophobic close-ups in the bank. The editing by Dede Allen is breathtakingly good - it's completely absurd that she did not win the year's Oscar for her work here. The whole is masterminded brilliantly by Sidney Lumet, at the top of his game.A classic.",

            "content": "I have trouble watching most films from the 70s because they date themselves so badly, and because I despise 70s aesthetics and fashions.  Here's a film that doesn't seem dated at all -- in fact, it seems ahead of its time in many ways.  As far as I knew, crime films of this tone, with \"bad guys\" who are likeable, funny, and basically the guys next door didn't come around until Quentin Tarantino.Besides content, 70s films bug me due to their generally dismal production values and terrible prints -- the print I saw of this film on the USA Network, though, was crystal clear (though unmatted).  The dialogue track has a few creaky places production-wise, but visually the film could have been made last year, in terms of camera technique, editing, lighting (by contrast, I can't even watch \"The Sting\" (1973), with it's HORRID flat TV lighting), and so on.  I guess what helps is that the movie was based on a true story (funny to see the credit \"based on a magazine article by\" ;^>), and the director was going for a very cinema verite approach.  In this spirit, there is no music in the movie past the opening credits (and that song becomes one that's playing on the principals' radio), and this helps the movie attain its riveting tone and avoid becoming dated due to the soundtrack.Other high points are of course the writing, Sidney Lumet's direction (I was not previously familiar with his work), and Al Pacino's always inspired acting.  It's also neat to see the young Lance Henriksen (who looks surprisingly non-different from today's Lance Henriksen ;^>).  The frank treatments of subjects like sex changes and the gay community (a term I would have assumed was coined more recently) are also interesting to see for a mainstream movie of this long ago.Oh, if by any chance you're checking out this movie because you're a Carol Kane fan (my \"Carol Kane\" TiVo wishlist recorded the film for me), don't watch it solely for her -- she doesn't get to do much.

I think the film is at its best when it shows the reactions the civilians have to Sonny throughout the day. Those scenes are all great. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the scenes which occur inside the bank. Sal isn't that memorable as Sonny's accomplice and the other bank workers are pretty bland as well. I do like the rare bit of tension in the bank (mainly in the first act) and how both groups eventually get along with each other, but even those elements grow a bit tiring as the film goes on, especially in the second half. But yeah, whenever Sonny exits the bank, the film gets me on board again. Whether you're referring to how Sonny becomes a celebrity amongst the civilians, the iconic \"Attica!\" scene, or how the civilians remain supportive of him after they learn he's from the LGBT community (I'm curious how well those scenes were received back in the day), those parts of the film are full of life. So much texture and detail is thrown into that one street, it feels like a vivid portrait of New York in the 70's which you could step into. Though yeah, all things considered, the film is a mixture of great and (somewhat) dull which provides a ceiling to my enjoyment of it.",

He mucks up, he's nervous , he has no plan , he hasn't even a clue!.Of course he's not alone along with him is his good friend who also doesn't know what to do next. Sonny describes him as the trigger guy \"i bark , he bites\" but is he really such a tough nut?Well that should get you started without ruining anything.First off Pacino's performance in this film is great it has to be up there with some of my all time favourite roles.The story is gripping and exciting to say the least and is even further backed up by the fact that it's true. Which always make the film more satisfying!.Every aspect of the movie is so simply amazing. Every line, every action every quote it's just simply put a great movie.I loved the way the seriousness of the situation was so often played down as if it were a tea party!. Even a lot of the people being held \"hostage\" didn't take these guys serious. It threw in a lot of sneaky comedy perfectly played off and emphasised by Pacino this guy can be really funny!.I also loved the way the situation began to pan out with Sonny becoming some what of a hero at one point and gaining almost \"celebrity status\" and loving it.But this all helps take your eyes off the ball \"the seriousness of the situation\" and completely shocks you when consequences are met by the \"robbers\". You have to see it to know what i mean so i'll leave it there.I think most people can enjoy this movie and i think most will.Give it a chance you never know the same thing might happen to you you might love it, definitely in my top 75-ish movies i've ever seen.9/10",

Al Pacino (Sonny), John Cazale (Sal), and Charles Durning (Moretti) give incredible performances.\n3. The pacing is superb, and it never loses steam.\n4. The movie really benefits from a scaled-back cinematography which allows the film to feel preponderantly more raw.\n5. The lack of a soundtrack/ score helps to keep the movie grounded, and it adds a certain grittiness to the scenes.\n6. The scope of the movie is truly impressive, especially considering its anchoring to one location for most of the run-time. The extras, also, really help to breathe life into the story.\n7. The ending is beautifully tragic, and it miraculously entices the viewer to sympathise and empathise with Sonny and Sal, even though they're bank robbers who took hostages.Cons:\n1. The tension is undercut as the hostages, as characters, are underdeveloped, and they never feel to be in any danger.\n2. The sub-plot featuring Sonny's gay transgender husband, Leon (Chris Sarandon), just feels out-of-place and rather pointless.",

Ask the crowd for females to volunteer as more hostages. There would be a handful.8. As soon as they turned off the air conditioning and the lights, Sonny should have said that everything is stopped until they turn them back on.There were a hundred options to try.

Quickly, you find out that the characters are conducting a bank robbery, OK. Sure, the reason is revealed later, but at the beginning, you're looking for some kind of sense in the movie, and it's not to be found. Once the police come in, the movie seems to make even less sense, with the police being emasculated by Pacino's character, and surrounding crowd that supports a bank robber... it just doesn't make any sense, and it's quite hard to believe it was based on a true story. I guess Pacino's character was crazy at the time of this robbery, and that becomes quite plain, yet he's not really sympathetic or interesting, just crazy and bizarre. Even when he's nice and concerned with the hostages his character isn't sympathetic, because he doesn't come off as someone with a measure of sanity, and until the whole bit about his wife, you mind as well think there's no reason at all for his robbing the bank. Anyhow, I'll admit I only watched half of the movie, but that half was entirely monotonous, and a waste of an hour of my life.I don't know why people think this movie is so great.

            "content": "Dog Day Afternoon is an on-reel embodiment of Murphy's Law - anything that can wrong will. Three men decide to rob a bank. Nothing seems to have been premeditated; it is almost as if they were going for lunch but make an impulsive detour. They go in and brandish their guns. One chickens out, leaves, while the two hold fort. Murphy springs his evil trap. The bank is found to have been emptied the same day, leaving only $1,100. And the cops have surrounded the building. The cops cannot storm the place since the two men Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) are holding hostages - the bank manager, an asthmatic guard and a bunch of female recruits. The situation is precariously balanced on a knife's edge. One wrong move and the whole thing blows. It's a deadlock; a stalemate. Despite bleak hopes of making out, Sonny refuses to surrender. He and his partner don't want to go to jail. The cops too are willing to play ball, for it is a hostage situation. Placing everything neatly on a landmine, the story unfurls. That is Dog Day Afternoon for you.Easily the most distinctive feature of the film is Pacino as the flamboyant Sonny. He is not a professional thief and does try to be one. He is a street-smart war veteran with almost no experience of working on the other side of the law and it succinctly shows. He is amateurish in every way possible \u2013 his clothes (brown tuxedo, pale yellow shirt with a stripped red and orange neck-tie), his demands and his behavior under pressure are all marred by the lack of professionalism. He is awfully kind to his captives and tries to keep them under the utmost care, perhaps a symptom of Stockholm syndrome. He isn't a cold-hearted, callous thief, and that is why you feel sorry for him. Pacino plays his role so delightfully that even watching him is sheer ecstasy. He does not impersonate Sonny. He slips into his skin and adopts his identity with perfection.John Cazale as Sal too does not get overshadowed under the imposing stature (at 5'7'', not literally of course) of Al Pacino. It is unfortunate that Cazale got to do merely five feature films (The Godfather, The Godfather: Part 2, The Deer Hunter, The Conversation and Dog Day Afternoon) before his untimely demise. Though in demeanour, he is quite the opposite of his partner \u2013 dark, silent and brooding with a foreboding air about him, the two get on pretty well, except for trivial disagreements when the look in Sal's cold, black eyes makes you fear that he will convert the entire bank into a slaughterhouse. He is the one who holds the hostages when Sonny, ever the people's man, negotiates with the cops under the sign of truce. He maintains his character with dignity, never letting the viewer slip from the impression that this is a dangerous man.Another highlight of the film is a trademark Sidney Lumet move \u2013 the way in which he has treated political issues, a thing that further adds to the drama and the taught, uncertain atmosphere. The director is popular for such twists in the tale. While in 12 Angry Men, he took on racism and darker sides of human idiosyncrasy and in Network he tackled the media, this time he has brought to light Attica prison riot, homosexuality and media, the latter in a different manner.Sonny cites the example of Attica when asked to surrender, which was a similar hostage situation in a prison where the prisoners demanded for better living conditions. Around forty people were killed by the State police, the innocent with the guilty. The memory of this incident helps him incite the masses who suddenly begin sympathizing with him and makes him something of a messiah. Around the middle of the movie, Sonny is revealed to be homosexual. Though not much has been said about the rampant prejudice against homosexuality, this fact helps him gain support from the homosexual community of the town. They appreciate that Sonny hasn't kept his secret closeted. It isn't long before almost all the throngs of people waiting outside the bank back Sonny. But it certainly makes us hope that Lumet wasn't trying to insinuate that all homosexuals should start grabbing guns and robbing their neighbourhood banks to gain recognition and popularity. That would be slightly inconvenient.The media plays a crucial part through this tumultuous roller-coaster ride. The thing about robbing a bank that appears so tantalizing so everyone, except the police, is the instant stardom, which is beautifully highlighted by a scene in the movie, where a delivery boy delivers a pizza to Sonny and yells excitedly to the cameras, 'I'm a f*****g star!'The concept is simple; nothing fancy, nothing extraordinary, but the prowess with which it has been portrayed constantly keeps the viewer on tenterhooks. The movie has a nonchalant, almost caustic sense of humour. It does appear overdrawn (125 minutes), but a Scorsese-like ending which gives the viewer the impression that the director suddenly decided to pack up makes up for it. The movie, however, might put you under the belief that the tale is too far-fetched to be feasible ('no one robs a bank just like that!'), but then again, this is a real-life story.",

            "content": "If the idea of an entire two hour movie being solely based on a single bank robbery sound boring than I would have agreed with you. But Dog Day Afternoon is extremely intriguing, why you may ask. Well the simple fact of it is that this film is more than just two hours of footage from inside a bank. First we have the media. We see how the bloodthirsty media will do anything to get their story and will feed the public as much information as they can get their dirty hands on no matter how relevant it is to the situation. We also see that the media seem more content on making heroes out of these criminals than covering the actual story, you think it's unbelievable just look at Charles Manson, this is justified in the film just by hearing the crowds reaction every time one of the robbers steps outside. Then we deal with family, love, identity and homosexuality, that sure is a lot for a bank robbing flick isn't it? To actually enjoy this film you have to dig a littler deeper, scratch a little harder and listen a little clearer to pick up on what is really going on, if not you will probably be experiencing the most boring two hours of your life. Al Pacino is fabulous, as always, as Sonny, the man who is robbing a bank so that he can pay for his lovers sex change operation. But he sees himself struggling not only to find his way out of the mess he is in but to find himself as a man and try to justify his actions. Pacino gets so deep into his character that the suspense created by the film has a very natural feel to it, not to mention that this was also based on a true story and it is very hard to make an audience believe that this has actually happened but Pacino does it beautifully. In the end we see that life is only as hard as you make it, as complex as you make it and as complicated as you make it, to use others as an outlet for you frustration will only dig yourself a deeper grave than you have already made for yourself. I highly recommend this film if not for the message beneath the surface than just for the overall impact the film has.",

First, because it contains one of the most fascinating movie-characters I've ever seen: bankrobber Sonny, wonderfully played by Al Pacino. Yes, he robs a bank (or tries to, that is), but that doesn't mean you'll dislike him. I felt sorry for him, the way he was jammed in between all those people who expected different things from him: the hostages, the police, his partner Sal, his wife, his mother, his lover. And, not to forget, the audience outside the bank. Sonny really fascinated me, and every now and then I still wonder how the real Sonny is doing nowadays. Second, I liked this movie because of the way the atmosphere in and outside the bank was presented. It's great to watch the New York crowd. And the humoristic elements all just had the right touch. Third, the casting was perfect. The woman playing the hostages were very good, Chris Sarandon was great. And I especially liked the way John Cazale played Sal, you'll always wonder what is going on inside that man's head, whether he will become violent or not. Although this movie is almost 25 years old, it's still one of my favourites (in fact: it was my first 'favourite movie' ever, I started to become a movie-fan thanks to this one!).

This is a film where you will see a different side. The film opens with a bank robbery and revolves around the struggles of a common man to steal money from the bank. The main problem which stopped sonny from achieving what he wanted was his kind heartedness. The film is a delight to watch. You would not want to miss it.PROS: Al Pacino has dominated in every scene. His acting in this film was the best I had seen. The story was based on a true incident so I would say that it was properly handled. You will watch it till the end whatever might be the case because Al Pacino will not let you leave even for a minute.CONS: The story seemed to be kind of dragging in the middle. It looked as if things were inserted forcefully. But considering that it was made on true incident, I don't think that there can be any better representation than this.MESSAGE: \"Plan everything.\"VERDICT: \"A must watch.\"",

Generally, I'd say that the 70s were very kind to him, since he starred in many great films: \"The Godfather I and II\", \"And justice for all\" and this one. On the other hand, Lumet was also at his artistic peak during that time. It was such a combination; Nothing could possibly go wrong.The plot is based on real facts: Two miserable guys intend to do a robbery, but everything goes the wrong way. Before they split, the police arrive. Being quite desperate, they search for a helping hand in the mob that surrounds the bank, who see them as anti-heroes. All of a sudden, they are the heroes of the day; but they are also desperate.The movie goes through a lot of major issues, which appeared in the 70s, but continue to concern us even today: the press exploitation, the human desperation, the need for working-class heroes, the good and the wicked cops. It's all here. And to be more pleasant about it, it's not a sheer drama. Once the transvestite appears, comedy starts slipping in.I have to admit that it's not a flawless movie. I was quite shocked when that transvestite came in. But I still adore the whole atmosphere of the film, the fact that it's full of energy going on, even though it's generally a slow movie. And the finally scene is quite astonishing. It's a fast, surprising, but silent, scene. It captures the atmosphere of feeling disappointed exquisitely. I recommend it to anyone who'd like to see a great, but demanding, film.",

            "content": "After seeing it on the big screen for the first time, one thing I took away from the film when I reflected on it was that this film is similar to early Spielberg works in a way.What I mean by that is I read a book on interviews done with Spielberg, which touched on the idea that his early work revolved around stories where the media was involved somehow; the media looking at the event was an undertone of the film. In Dog Day Afternoon we get these aerial shots of Sonny outside the bank that captures what an event this was to the public - hundreds of extras as policemen, the media and the general public trying to catch a glimpse of the excitement of a bank robbery.Sonny even becomes an icon to the public when he says he doesn't want people killed, and gets people in an uproar when he reminds them of a similar situation in Attica (I believe) a short time ago. We see the people's reactions change as it is revealed that he has homosexual lover; some give him hate but he draws the attraction of the gay community.And these people aren't even inside with him as we are, missing out on how he acts in person. We see a performance by Pacino that cries out desperate and excitable in the best of ways. We see him stumble over problem after problem with the robbery, but he refuses to give up. He's a smart guy, having worked at a bank before, so it breaks him when his foolproof plan goes haywire in all sorts of directions.John Cazale is also in this film, and from what I have seen him in I say that he is a very underrated actor; without saying much in the film he has to pull of his character with subtleties, not exaggerations, and he does this very well. His best scene in the film is when he is being accused of being a hypocrite since he thinks the body should be protected since it is god's temple, yet he is in the process of robbing a bank.The film seems to drag at points with overly long sequences leading up to when transportation to an aircraft arrives for them. That doesn't mean these sequences lack content; there is a great moment when Sonny is making his will in case he dies before getting on a plane, but it feels like we wait half an hour between steps to his plan. Also, I was unimpressed by the actor who plays Sonny's lover.My friend pointed out that this film is somewhat anti-climactic but I didn't really think a big climax was necessary for this film, though I get his point. This is a great work of art that makes me want to watch more of Lumet's work in the near future, such as 12 Angry Men or Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.",

Based on a real incident which happened in Brooklyn, New York, Sonny played by the acting maestro Al Pacino robs a bank to pay for his lover's operation; it turns into a hostage situation and a media circus. The whole story claimed to be real always seems so unconvincing like hostages playing with the gun of Sonny, public cheering for Sonny, cops never seem too serious about the situation and so on. But what keeps you glued till the end is the unpredictable nature of events and remarkable performance by Al Pacino. His expressions, dialogs and whole persona is just irresistible. Supporting actors; John Cazale playing the eccentric crime partner and Charles Durning playing the brave cop who has to negotiate with Sonny before FBI takes over do their part quite right. Sidney Lumet tries hard to keep you engaged but story losses its juice because of lack of back story and a rushed climax.

The movie's great tension comes from the fact that even though it has a time span of only few hours, the mood changes constantly as the exposure of the character's inner fears and needs gradually comes to fruition. Al Pacino is great as the clumsy, yet determined bank robber, who became sort of a celebrity through all his wrongdoings. While the robbery doesn't go as planned, Sonny slowly shows his true self, as his insatiable desire to become a star exceeds the urge to steal the money. Unfortunately, his friend Sam isn't as strong and charismatic. He starts to crack, and feels weaker and weaker every minute, and wants for this nightmare to end. And it ends, but not nearly as perfect as the boys imagined. A clever play on clich\u00e9s, with an emphasis put on the society's reaction to a horrible event, which actually comes as more entertaining that harrowing in the final evaluation. An iconic movie, supported by electrifying performances by Al Pacino and John Cazale. A bank robbery that turned out to be a reality show for the masses. Intriguing.",

On the interior it focuses on issues related with how an ordinary individual can make an impact and become a someone from a no one in a few hours (the ATTICA scene) ,homosexuality is a also a theme in this film and it is portrayed in way in which gay people are also human and have to accepted into society n most importantly the entire movie was not just carried by sonny but also by sal ,whose character I cannot forget.This is an excellent film .See it .See it Again n again till u learn something about society was in the 70's n how it is now",

            "content": "(some spoilers)Ultimately, the audience has a tough time deciding what genre Dog Day Afternoon belongs with. The storyline is very slow paced, but the subtleties in action and humor that progress the story are very strong contributing elements. As with many of his films, Lumet takes a very even-handed approach to telling tales. This strategy clearly began with 12 Angry Men as nearly the entire film takes place at one location. Both films easily take advantage of the audiences' desire to alleviate tension from time to time. Though Dog Day Afternoon is ultimately a crime-drama, it dabbles relentlessly in comedy. Naivety is initially displayed when Sonny and Sal begin the heist. After the film progresses, it is clear that Sal maintains this characteristic to support contrast between leader and follower. The film also incorporates a healthy amount of absurdism through Sonny's first wife Leon. There is nothing more surprising or shocking in this film. The subject matter is bewildering yet intriguing, its application is upbeat and non-partisan, and the effect is hilarious but poignant. Ironically, one of the film's most dramatic scenes is the (improvised) telephone conversation between the two former lovers. This particular sequence earned Chris Sarandon a Best Supporting Actor nomination for the 1976 Academy Awards.Finally, exhibitionism exercises the audiences' right to sympathize with the men. Our perspective is echoed in the mobs outside the bank. These individuals have decided to support the determined (but socially detached) thieves. The public seems eager for the spectacle to unfold, yet they rally against law enforcement and instantly assimilate their influence into the conflict. A good look at the consequences of stupidity.***1/2 (of ****)",

            "content": "\"Biography\" is a genre tag that generally indicates a story of dry fact and dull predictability, but Dog Day Afternoon convinced me otherwise. Having seen the relatively recent Joker (2019), a few minutes of digging brought me to a clip of Todd Philips citing this movie as an inspiration for his own script, and that was all I needed to hear.Starting out with a montage of 70's New York that shifts from grand panorama to unbecoming filth, Lumet clearly leaves no stones unturned when it comes to revealing the candid truth. Only the first minute or so of the film is accompanied by a score and the rest is a saga of silence, giving a documentary feel to the gripping events that follow. Portraying a true story is admittedly a challenge, and despite protests from the real life \"Sonny\" concerning certain aspects of the narrative, the story we see succeeds to a great extent in encapsulating the truth of the actual incident while also retaining an engagingly dramatic tone. Especially commendable is the handling of the homosexual theme of the event, which in the period of its release, was a much controversial topic.Taking the viewer through a wide range of emotion, the story evolves from an almost goofy comedy to a chilling tragedy, with the claustrophobia of the closed bank space bringing out the peculiarities of each character. Pacino's performance as Sonny is a masterpiece of method acting, each nervous twitch a measured decision on the part of the actor, bringing us ever closer to the complex character he portrays. Cazale maintains a mostly mute presence, yet a disturbing sense of determination and fear shines through his aura of silence.With outstanding acting, perceptive directing and a surprising story, this is a movie that belongs at the top of any crime/biography genre listing.",

            "content": "IMDb Top 250: 180Dog Day Afternoon is a unique film. It's a heist movie, but a special kind of heist movie. There are no gritty stand-offs; this is a smart, tell-it-like-it-was kind of film, and it can seems a little silly at times. That's because it actually was silly at times. The summary almost reads off like the start of a joke: 'So a gay man walks into a bank...' In real life, Sonny (real name John) robbed a bank to pay for his lover's sex change operation. I won't spoil anymore, because spoiling the truth is spoiling the movie. The direction is perfect. The tone of the film is almost light-hearted: Sonny fumbles his gun, one crook cracks... it reminds me of Goodfellas in a sense that while not being funny, you can't help but smile.A big part of this is Sonny. Al Pacino, in one of his best (unfortunately underrated) roles, play the rookie bank robber AMAZINGLY. When you look at great actors, it's easy to say \"Oh yeah, he is the character, he's real good\" but here it's incredible. His eyes, facial expressions, the way he walks and talks, its an absolute sell. You feel for him, all he wants is to help someone he loves but things just went to #%@*. He's the best part of the film. Everyone else does their job, but are unfortunately in the same movie as Al Pacino. Sal isn't a lovable guy, he's kind of dumb (Wyoming) and a follower. He could've been fleshed out a little more.One thing of interest is the crowd. If you are like me and like to know NOTHING going into your films, skip this paragraph. If you've done even a little reading, you know Sonny is gay. I did not, which is why it was a little surprising, but then not: he subtly conveys it throughout the film. I found it interesting to see the crowd's love of Sonny before the reveal, including the small things like flipping off the officers, as well as cheering for him. But after they learn, there's more subtle movements: you can here \"He's a queer?\" in an offensive tone, as well as see members of the crowd doing a \"package-grab\" gesture in the background as Sonny pats down the FBI agent. Seeing this in 2011, it's an interesting time capsule, seeing the social norms of the 70's towards a gay man. He's a hero if he's straight, but just a gay man if he's gay.Dog Day Afternoon is a really good film, highlighted by great directing and a very strong lead that makes everyone weak in comparison. It's also a time capsule to when things were different, in the long-ago time of... the 70's. 8.3/10",

The plot is based on a true story and is pretty much filmed as if in a theater stage only comprised of a small urban New York bank and its immediate surroundings. One of the highs is found in the amazing cast that so naturally portrayed what was a set of challenging roles. Al Pacino is not only convincing, but in his lunacy and rhythm finds a way to charm us with his wit and the natural quality he manages to give his character. His male lover Leon makes another convincing short presentation that never makes us doubt about the truly dysfunctional lifestyle they have. Sonny's partner Sal played wonderfully by the late John Cazale speaks with the same frailty and emotional instability he gave his famous Godfather character. The movie does well to seem natural, far from the flamboyance that tends to haunt Hollywood when making films about cops trying to take down bad guys. The 2 hour long film also keeps you at the edge of your seat, giving you sufficient thrills along the road to keep you guessing and wishing for the best. The only criticism I have are the unnecessary shots of New York City at different moments in the movie as if watching Manhattan will helps us understand anything more about the movie and its characteristic New York characters.",

            "content": "In 1972, two men decided to rob a small Chase bank in Brooklyn, New York. The robbery should've lasted ten minutes, but due to poor planning and a couple simple mistakes, the robbery quickly escalated into a hostage negociation that involved the NYPD and FBI. The media quickly picked up the story, and within an hour of the report going out, dozens and dozens of New Yorkers and news vans flooded the area to catch a glimpse at the unfolding crime scene. After 14 hours, the standoff ended, resulting in one fatality and a crazy story that would eventually become one of the 1970s best movies.Al Pacino is Sonny, a young Vietnam veteran who is attempting to rob a bank to pay for his gay lover's sex-change operation. His partner, Sal, and him really don't have much of a plan, and when it all goes wrong, they demand the FBI send a limo and an airplane to get them out of the country. Sonny is not a bad person, per se - he's emotionally unstable and has had an extremely difficult time re-entering civilian life after fighting in the war. Sal is a bit more disengaged altogether, and has no real backstory other than that he has had several run-ins with the law before.The surprising part of this movie is that the audience comes to sympathize (in a strange way) with the robbers as well as the hostages. In real life, the tellers and bank manager reported to news outlets that they actually enjoyed their time with the robbers, saying they were very funny and surprisingly good conversationalists. This comes through in the movie, especially at the end when a teller, being let go as part of an agreement between Sonny and the FBI, gives Sal a cross and tells him not to worry - even if it is his first time on a plane, it'll be all right. \"I'll pray for you,\" she says, almost sad to be leaving him behind.The performances are all top-notch. From the rowdy mob in the street to Sonny's gay lover, Leon; from the goofy teller who seems to be enjoying the hostage situation to Pacino and Cazale themselves, everyone does a terrific job of keeping the audience engaged and entertained. With the exception of a song played during the opening sequence, there is no soundtrack, which is shockingly effective and adds to the vivid realism of the movie.If you've never seen this movie, please watch it.

            "content": "An incident/procedural drama studying all roles in its unfolding--perpetratorss, hostages, cops, the media, and spectators. The sum of the parts is greater than the whole, and all parts have a responsibility in any moral judgement of its outcome. Especially criticized is the relationship between the perpetrator of actions and the media, and the media's position to both report to and represent the spectator public. What starts out as an act of personal desperation escalates into public forum as self-described \"good Catholic\" Sonny instigates his own gladiatorial trial of grievances using the loudest voice in the land--media--to build camaraderie and incite sympathy. \"Attica! Attica!\" is the mantra of the day. Sal, Sonny's fellow perpetrator, has no such self-cleansing need. His inner demons have never heard of the Geraldo show.The film quickly takes an hysterical tone. Most of the dialogue is shouted. As the heat increases, Sonny's neuroses are paraded out.Halfway through the Nixon years, the steam ran out of the protest movement. Why? One reason was that the powers that be--government and big business--had re-gained control of the media by learning the lessons taught by the radicals in how to manipulate it. Demonstrating became passe. Counter-culture was absorbed into the mass media--Mod Squad, Laugh-In, Alice B. Toklas, etc--and its idealism trivialized. TV sees only surface. It does not have the attention span to unearth deeper thoughts.Sonny is a good man using the wrong means for his hopes and dreams. He becomes a symbol of a larger body of protest and anger.As a result, the movie negates the moral crux of its time by making Sonny subject to such hysterical judgment. It is saying it was all a temper tantrum collectively thrown by a bunch of neurotics who couldn't work out their personal problems. Sonny, as a character and a symbol, is finally deemed pathetic and small, his power diminished to nothing more than the deafening but harmless noise of jets at the airport.Ultimately, this film constricts the art and possibilities of cinema into the confines of its bastard child--TV.",

            "content": "Dog Day Afternoon is more than a simple heist film. For me, it's unrivalled in the genre because it genuinely has something to say about the world but it also delivers us a captivating story. It's also a triumph in film naturalism - it's clear it's based on a true story, but it's also a movie at the same time.By the ten minute mark, you're already inside the bank watching Sonny and Sal brandishing weapons, haplessly demanding what they've come for, right in the thick of the action, surrounded by a cast of relatable and interesting bank employees. The rest, as they say, is history. The slow, sometimes painful to watch, and at times hilarious, unravelling of their plan, as well as their desperation growing into fear as the media circus outside the building explodes into a frenzy, makes this film endlessly riveting and hugely entertaining.Al Pacino, who should have won the Academy Award for this film, has never been better and leads with unpredictability and intensity. John Cazale, who I've no doubt would be considered one of the great film character actors if he were alive today (he can wear that title even so, in my opinion), was robbed of a nomination for his role as the vulnerable Sal. The smoking scene alone should have clinched it.My favourite thing about Dog Day Afternoon, and there are many to choose from, is the sound. There's no soundtrack, only a few diegetic songs included, and the very careful use of gunshots. You think of a heist film, you hear gunshots. That's the way most Hollywood movies work now - to go in \"all guns blazing\". But Sidney Lumet (I think this is his finest piece of direction) uses only a few in the entire film, and you have to wait a while before you hear the first. When it comes, it rings out with enormous power and it becomes a key moment.What else can I say? As a very keen film fan, I often struggle to answer the question \"what are your favourite movies?\" because I love so many, but Dog Day Afternoon is one that always comes to mind. Top ten, definitely. Top five, almost certainly.Oh, one more thing: Attica! Attica! Attica!",

            "content": "\"Dog Day Afternoon\" is the more-or-less true story of an inept Brooklyn bank robbery by Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale). The robbery is comically inept from the start, with a third accomplice getting cold feet and leaving, and Sonny's massive bag for the cash dwarfing the few thousand dollars the bank has in the vault, as the mid-day pickup has occurred already. After starting a fire to burn records of the traveler's checks they're stealing, neighboring business owners are tipped off and the chaos begins.This is definitely a movie about chaos. A crowd gathers to enjoy the drama, at first cheering on Sonny as he famously chants \"Attica! Attica!\". The movie is about so much more than just an inept bank robbery, as clearly we are seeing a society in confused, quasi-rebellion against corrupt authority, but as in real life, the rage in this movie doesn't really go anywhere, with the crowd more interested in cheap thrills than politics. The media is on hand in droves, turning the standoff into the night's feature entertainment for the entire city, especially once they learn that Sonny was married to a woman-in-a-man's body by a defrocked priest. The crowd turns to homophobia and gay liberation protesters show up as darkness falls on the scene.Meanwhile, Sonny is manic as he tries to keep his hostages in check, manage the emotions of his dim-witted accomplice Sal, negotiate with police for a helicopter and jet to the tropics, or maybe Algeria (or Wyoming). He also has to deal with no less than both his wives and his mother, in conversations that in a darkly funny way show that even amid a hostage standoff his basic problems with the people in his life are inescapable. The movie is shot in a cinema verite style aside from a musical intro, with no background music. It is effective for the most part. I found that the movie drags as it goes on, unfortunately, especially over the very long phone conversation between Sonny and his new wife. The movie starts out so wildly unconventional, based on perhaps the most preposterous bank robbery ever committed, but its ending seems to be done more in the style of a typical crime film of the 1970s. Perhaps that is how events really unfolded, but I found the way it was presented to not quite live up to the film's tremendous start.This is nevertheless definitely a film worth watching, it is as quintessentially a movie of 1970s New York as Taxi Driver or anything by Woody Allen. It is also one of Pacino's greatest performances, and some of Lumet's best work.",

The insanity of this true story is painstakingly captured. The bank tellers are a hoot and the crowd egging on Pacino after each time he makes an appearance outside of the bank adds to the insanity.

            "content": "The problem with a lot of modern movies is that have a message, is they tend to really whack you over the head with it. Either that or they are hopelessly obscure.No such problems with Dog Day Afternoon. It doesn't even have a \"message\" necessarily, but its still one of the most thought provoking movies ever made. It's also probably one of the saddest, and the funniest.I could give endless praise to everyone involved ( except for Chris Saradon sort of struck a wrong note with me ), I could say how brilliant John Cazale is (RIP), and Charles Durning and every one of the hostages. But I really can't think of anything I could say to give everyone their due. They are portraying individual people, but they are all also saying something about people in general and how we operate and communicate with each other. They are perfect.And there is nothing I can really say about Al Pacino here. All I can give you is that this is probably one of the greatest performances of all time. Thats going to sound funny to those who have seen it because its not that kind of performance. Its almost a small performance, actually. Sonny's just not that kind of person. He doesn't draw attention to himself, but you can't take your eyes off him. He is a small spark of manic energy and constant movement. He lights up the screen, but he doesn't fill it up. This isn't something Marlon Brando or Jack Nicholsen or somebody like that could have done in a million years. The extent to which he makes Sonny exist, that he shares his nerve endings, as I like to say, is simply extraordinary. People always love to say ,\"you can't see them acting\". Here it's really true. Pacino and his costars also seems to share with the screenwriter a mischievous appreciation of the absurd and an understanding of the overwhelming pathos, joy and humor of normal, unimportant little things. And its precisely those little things that make the movie.It did have its big-scale effect though. Besides laying out a pattern for most bank heist movies today, it also gave Pacino his first opportunity to exercise his vocal chords on camera. American cinema would never be the same.Dog Day Afternoon is certainly one of the best movies of the seventies. its as good in its way as some of the most beloved movies ever made. But while most great movies seem to share a certain sweeping, epic feeling, Dog Day afternoon feels personal, real and unpolished and thats what makes it so fascinating and wildly entertaining.",

            "content": "\"Dog Day Afternoon\" is the famous (purportedly true) story of a bank heist gone wrong. Because its reputation precedes it, it lacks in flashy shoot-outs, and its social commentary tirades are a bit outdated, the movie may not deliver to modern audiences with the same gravity as it did when it was released. The film is a showcase for one of Pacino's most controlled, nuanced performances and the story has some interesting things to say about loyalty within relationships and friendships. There is some amusing dialog with regards to Vietnam veterans, transgender and homosexual romance and even smoking (maybe a touchy subject at the time).The film feels longer than it is and seems to build toward a surprise twist that never appears, but it is solidly crafted throughout and the climax itself is much more intoxicating for the masterful build-up. The tasteful camera cinematography (a staple of pre-80s films!) and the absence of a musical score both work to accentuate the character portraits and claustrophobic nature of the situation.While maybe not one of the greatest movies of all time, it's certainly one of the notable ones of its decade, expertly crafted with some stand-out performances by Pacino and John Cazale. And while influencing a number of films since its release, \"Dog Day Afternoon\", also seems to have been the inspiration for the charming early '90s comedy, \"Airheads\", about a band of metalheads who get trapped while holding up an LA radio station.",

            "content": "DOGDAY AFTERNOONEvery movie has a setting. Every movie has a plot. Yet it is only when the two are so heavily dependant on one another, and so intertwined to become the sole backbone of the film, that a movie like Dogday Afternoon comes around. And there are few films that remain faithful to the facts of a real-life true tale. These are things to consider as we witness the historical re-enactment of one of the most famous bank robberies of our time.From start to finish you will primarily see only two locations in this film's setting: The bank, where history was created, and within the vehicle, where it suddenly ended. Sidney Lumet's emphasis on having nearly an entire film take place behind closed doors illustrates the intensity and heightened tension of every character's situation. The only other scenes that were filmed away from the bank were roughly on par, perhaps, with the number of audaciously performed acts of him emerging from within. Yet most of the pressure arises from the inside. Then people start becoming very hot, very hungry, and very very stir crazy. And whenever Sonny steps outside, he releases all that energy out onto the awaiting crowds, furthermore fueling his supportive fans.As much as the inhabitants of the bank are gradually exhausting, a phenomenal occurrence takes place; Sonny has won the favor of his own hostages. This fact was one of the most intriguing processes in film history. As the film proceeds from the intro, the majority of the captives slowly unveil their eyes to realize the true nature of Sonny's intentions and motives. They realize that this man is no killer, this man is no lunatic, and for all essential practicality, Sonny (last name) is no criminal.This feature is truly a milestone in blockbuster history, and any viewer can attest to the captivating journey through history's window of intrigue. This film should have the impact of leaving someone nothing less than speechless, and rendering at least one major conclusion to its purposeful essence: This film is powerfully important.Many inhabitants of this great planet will make a weekly trip to deposit their hard-earned wages, and many go daily. But next time they step outside their doors, perhaps they should take a closer look at what the mornings atmosphere has to offer. Maybe even take a long drink of the fresh air's pureness. Absorb the finer details of life's greatness and hopefully realize, today just might be a Dog Day Afternoon.",

When he says he's prepared to send out bodies, I had a feeling he meant it. Some of the shouting-match negotiations between Sonny (Pacino) and Detective Moretti (Durning) are really funny.  While I thought it was pretty solid, I don't rate it as an all-time classic like others seem to.

Everything else was new to me and Al Pacino being one of my favorite actors I was more than thrilled when I noticed that Dog Day Afternoon would be on TV tonight. And it wasn't a disappointment. Right from the start, when the third robber with Pacino and Cazale gave up, I knew that this is going to be interesting. For me that was a totally new way to start a bank robbery. And it got interesting, I can say that. The dominant feeling during the film was that the two robbers were completely out of their element and in the wrong place. The whole time I had a feeling that Cazale's character Sal would do something hazardous and blow the whole thing. Pacino's Sonny was also a big question mark. What would a nice guy like him do in a situation like that? And I couldn't get a straight answer to that question. Although he had big problems with money and family he didn't seem that desperate. Well, they say that the quiet ones are the most dangerous and unpredictable ones in reality. This quiet and odd pair got my sympathy right from the start and had it all the way till the end. Sonny was the one who exceeded himself time after time (or so it seemed) and Sal was only trying to hang on and do what Sonny tells him to. It was a surprise that they got as far as they did. Also the other people in the movie were a bit different than in most of these kind of crime movies. There were no panicing and screaming hostages or cops with a too heavy trigger finger. The usual and annoying cliches were left out. The cops and the crooks had an unusual understanding between each other, for example in the negotiation situations. I've never seen the cops saving the villain from a raging civilian when the villain has come out to negotiate. Maybe I haven't seen enough these kind of movies or then it's just one of the particularities of this one, I don't know. Anyways, the great suspense and atmosphere lasts all the way till the end of the film when the final solution takes place. Also the solution feels really realistic (well, it is based on a true story) and it also seems to be the only right one to end the story. As a whole, Dog Day Afternoon is a great and entertaining film with all its unconventional characters and situations. Pacino also makes a convincing performance while other performances stay in the background much because of Pacino's great work.",

I mean, it is as good as the godfather part 1 and 2.My fren used to tell me long time ago about 3 best movie of pacino after the great godfather movie. And here, the three movie which i check out in the movie database, as one of the top movie in the world. At that time, i still haven't watch these movie. It was none other than SCARFACE, HEAT and of course, DOG DAY AFTERNOON! The first movie of al pacino that i watch is SEA OF LOVE, and so ifall in love with al pacino movie. Let me tell you,i'm really a fan of al pacino after watching his movie. SCARFACE is the 2nd movie i watch and consider the BEST! Then i watch HEAT,of course,as good as SCARFACE.But..after watching DOG DAY AFTERNOON...(by the time i'd watched GODFATHER 1,2,3), i had to admit, this is the BEST of his carrier ! no wonder there are nobody say this movie is stupid,because it is the greatest ! I can guarantee that nowadays,nobody will be able to create a special movie like this !Pacino has given his finest performance in this movie.I juz disagree that this movie is not rated as high as THE GODFATHER. Spend your money and watch this movie. You wont lose anything about this movie. The actor are definitely great,(especially CHRIS SARANDON),the director himself,(who won an Oscar for this great movie),and the storyline, are all powerful indeed!! A very classic movie..a legend...don't lose it! buy it! 10/10*******",

There is some touches of humor. One of my favorite part was when one of the bank clerk hostages pulled out a cigarette and Sal tells her to put it away because it's not healthy. Almost all the story takes place either inside a bank or on the street just outside. The premise is simple - Sonny and Sal attempt to rob a bank and are surrounded by the police. In order to get out of this, Sonny and Sal tries to cut a deal with the sheriffs by using the bank clerks as hostages. Seems like all is going well for Sonny and they actually make it all the way to the airport. The ending, by the way, was just a little too short and simplistic. I expected a little bit more considering how much time and suspense was built-up until that point. Everything else was great though.",

Everything about this movie is impressive and Al Pacino above anything else.The characters are marvelous,so identifiable and yet so over-the-top.The movie also succeeds in making collective characters (the public,the police,the press) so vivid and together with the individual characters, are perfectly coordinated in a crazy dance right before our eyes. Too bad about the Oscar competition with One Flew Over The Coockoo's Nest that year,where it lost to almost every category in favor of Milos Forman's masterpiece, because it definitely deserved more hype than it got.But it is a cult classic nevertheless,I've rarely seen people talking so passionately about a movie than about this one, and it's interesting to note that it appeals to almost all ages (except under 18, maybe). On a last note,I find that Lumet's work is so underrated.His movies are just as impressive as Scorsese's or Kubrick's,and yet he is one of the least hailed.",

Too modern. Sonny is a character that defies genre and cinematic norms. Al Pacino's genius acting sends the character into the stratosphere in that regard. Not the bumbling fool, not the sympathetic case, not the hearthrob hero, he exists somewhere in between all three at once and outside of all three at the same time. You want him to succeed because he's relatable, and he's relatable because he's perfectly human.Furthermore, it's hard to consider this film anything other than a crime drama, but being a crime drama, Dog Day Afternoon hardly feels like a drama, and it hardly feels like it fits into the canonical crime drama umbrella. Mostly it feels so hard to categorize because Sidney Lumet does such a fantastic job genre bending this film into both a dark comedy and something of a slice of life. What we're left with is a film that truly pushes the boundaries of what was even enjoyable at the time into something that laid the groundwork for all modern crime drama.Films like The Godfather and The Sugarland Express maybe better and character study and sprawling drama respectively, but Dog Day Afternoon turns the character study on its head and condenses the sprawl into a single setting. Truly inventive and extremely enjoyable: 8/10.",

I really wish that this movie is watched by everyone today to appreciate what brilliant cinema is like and to watch in awe & understand as to why Al Pacino received 5 successive Oscar nominations in only his first 6 years into movies- a feat that leaves me awe-struck even to this day- The man is BRILLIANT in DDA to say the least. The way Pacino conveys his innermost fears, intensity, love, vulnerability, strength, optimism and innocence (all at one and the same time) with his eyes and his body language is a treat to watch. He leaves you wonder-struck and enchanted. I truly believe it was highly unfair on the part of the Academy not to have awarded him an Oscar for this.

This is a tour-de-force for Pacino, even by his standards, as the bungling crook who has instantly become the biggest media star in the city. There are more twists and turns we won't go into here. This is a great work by Pacino, Lumet, and most of the other actors in the film. I loved it.Pacino's performance is exceedingly excellent, manic and energetic. He'd display this same talent in \"Scarface\" again eight years later; only he would be bashed by the critics for going over-the-top. (Although they really just had problems with the excessive profanity and violence, just like Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\" will soon become a well-known classic and people will laugh when they hear that someone once called it the most violent film ever made.)In a nutshell I would say that it is one of the great movies of all time. Anyone who calls himself a movie buff, this movie is a must watch for him.This amazing film somehow manages to capture the dense texture of real life. Improvisational acting, no artificial lighting, no costumes or makeup other than what was essential to the character, and no musical score help make it that way. So do intense performances from Al Pacino, John Cazale, and Charles Durning. Frank Pierson's screenplay was well-constructed, although 60% of the dialogue was improvised. It allowed room for moving drama, so-surreal-it-could-only-happen-in-real-life comedy, and quite a bit of suspense.10/10",

But additionally there was a lot of economically involved and well specifically the scene where Al Pacino is being interviewed on the news and makes the point about his inability to get a decent job and how he could survive on any wages that aren't union... I was of course surprised and delighted how the crowd took his side. Largely this was due to him calling out attica A reference to a prison riot in which people were killed I don't know a lot about it we'll have to research that more. My other big take away was how this took place in 1974 grand in about 50 years ago, when he got pizza for themselves and all the hostages there were 10 people and they showed up with three large pizzas... Granted later we found out that he didn't eat any of the pizza, however in 2021 America if you were to order pizza for 10 people under no circumstances would you show up with three large pizzas... That's 24 slices of pizza for 10 people just one work in modern America especially any circumstance where are the people haven't eaten in a long time (just an observation I made ) Just made for a better story.

Being based on a true story it comes off as a period piece, but actually the film does not post date the actual events so much. There is no sense of dated film-making or performances. The question for the potential viewer is just what kind of film experience they want to have. Sure, there are times you mentally cheer or laugh or find some victory, but this hopeless situation takes a poke at society from a number of angles.

            "review_title": "An excellent film",
            "content": "'Dog Day Afternoon' is definitely one of the finest films of the 1970s. It perfectly captures the pessimistic view of America at the time, and succeeds in creating the ultimate anti-hero whom people across America turned to. The film has a very simple storyline. Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) attempt to rob a bank, but only manage to get $1100. To make matters worse, the police arrive and the duo are trapped in the bank with 12 hostages. Sidney Lumet had already proved his ability to direct long conversational scenes with his masterpiece '12 Angry Men', but Dog Day Afternoon', as mentioned before, does so in a much more sympathetic manner. The audience feels real sympathy for Sonny, despite his criminal intentions. The character struggles through life as so many Americans did at the time. Sonny is kind hearted, and his inexperience and struggles only earn him more sympathy. Al Pacino portrays Sonny in a very realistic manner, based upon the real life Sonny whose attempted robbery inspired the film. The sympathy and support for Sonny is intensified further when crowds in the film cheer him on, and the issue of homosexuality was raised, being a controversial topic. These make 'Dog Day Afternoon' an almost unbearably realistic film, and this only enhances the quality of its direction. The mixed pace of the film, sometimes fast and sometimes slow only intensifies the confusion experienced by Sonny, and again intensifies the sympathy toward him. The film is intense, and this is a result of the pace as the audience feels the anger and frustration that the characters do, unaware of what will happen. This is a very successful feature of the film. However, this does remove the ability to revisit the film regularly as the impact is not the same the second time around. Nevertheless, I consider 'Dog Day Afternoon' to be one of Pacino's best films, and also John Cazale's second best performance. The chemistry between Pacino and Cazale (real life friends) is clearly visible on screen and adds massively to the film's emotion, especially at the end. Had the film not been up against 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' for the Best Picture Oscar in 1976, I am sure that 'Dog Day Afternoon' would have won. This is a must see film guys, and definitely as fiercely relevant now as it was in 1975 in my opinion!",

            "content": "I've seen it said frequently about this film that it is a commentary on the nature of media and sensationalism, and how those things can warp the perception of certain events and people. This is a fair analysis, but what I think is perhaps more significant to me, though perhaps not as clever, is that this film is a careful study of how different people react to a crisis. Of course, these things are not mutually exclusive. The media certainly acts as a major force of change both in the nature of the story and in the characters. I think though, that the idea that this film is just about how the media affects people is insufficient. How then is the viewer meant to understand the scenes which altogether lack any media presence? In the quieter moments of this film, when the cameras have gone away and the crowd is silent, the heart of this film reveals itself. It is about people reacting to crisis. Not just the crisis of a robbery gone wrong, but personal crisis. What drives characters in the film is not how they think the cameras will perceive them (not saying that part is not also essential in appreciating this film). The protagonist, masterfully performed by Al Pacino, is not motivated by it. He's motivated by the tumultuous nature of his life which has led him to this point, and the desperation it has instilled in him. The police too, are not driven by cameras and crowds, they simply measure their actions differently. Media changes the dynamics, but it doesn't change reality. The reality is that people are brought together by a tense situation and are defined by how they compose themselves when the pressure's on. The best example of this theme in action within the characters is in the transition of police leadership of the stand-off from Moretti to Sheldon. I found watching this film that when Sheldon confronts Sonny for the first time, I could tell it was the beginning of the end. It isn't just that Sheldon represents a more formidable branch of law enforcement, but that he conducts himself in a more powerful way. He's cool and collected. Up to this point in the film you sort of get the sense that Sonny and Morreti are approaching the situation with pretty similar attitudes. They're both struggling to maintain their composure and they're seemingly blindsided by the fiasco that is the hostage situation. Sheldon is not blindsided. They're isn't a trace of doubt or fear in him. He has it all under control, which means that Sonny has lost all power. Watching his interactions with Sheldon I just knew that it was already over. How could a mere victim of circumstance best what is obviously a master of fate and will? The direction of this film is also demonstrative of this theme. You might notice, especially if you've seen a Lumet film before, that the use of music in this film is very limited. This strikes me as being very deliberate both stylistically and dramatically. After all, wouldn't it make more sense to play up the sensational nature of the story by adding a melodramatic score to punctuate every little interaction? That would be very meta. What this selective choice of music suggests, to me at least, is that reality is distinct from the media circus. It surrounds the characters, it influences their behavior to a certain extent, but ultimately it isn't the reality they occupy. They are still trapped in their circumstances, and no amount of cheering, jeering, or filming can change that. All that's left for them is to decide how to handle their crises. That also explains the nature of the cinematography, which also seems a bit restrictive at times. There's little movement and the often the camera is sort of just set at eye level. Nothing too crazy. The effect of this is that you find yourself, as the viewer, just as trapped as the characters you're observing. You don't get to have a dozen montages and swoop over the roof as the police plot their infiltration because that isn't something any of the characters can do. This film respects the barrier between crisis and coverage. It endeavors to thrust its characters into a disaster and ask you to consider how they're reacting. The commentary it makes on the media is valid, and should be considered carefully, but in doing so don't forget what's happening when the cameras are away.",

Two men attempt to rob a bank that turns into a hostage situation.Review: Now in my opinion I think this movie started Al Pacino's career as a movie actor. What I love about this movie is how the film has a lot comedy in it and there's a great twist in the story. The acting is terrific. Pacino and Cazale have great chemistry working together. Also the film seems like it's making fun of how the media acts. The story is also very intense because you never know what's going to happen to the robbers or hostages. I think this is probably one of the best movies that was made in the 70's. Everything in this movie is perfect from the acting, story, and the dialogue between Pacino and the cops which is very good. If your a fan of Pacino or heist genre then this is your movie.\"ATTICA ATTICA!\" -Sonny",

It's not just a roller-coaster anymore. You admire the actors, you appreciate the direction, the story, you try to look at the details, there's a lot to learn by watching a movie. But now and then, a movie comes by that makes you be a kid again. You forget all about yourself and when you realize you're shaking, you're nervous and scared about what's going to happen to this guy, like your very own life depends on it.Dog Day Afternoon is like that.You know what I'm talking about. Those movies that make you stop and realize that this is why cinema is a great form of art. In the times we live in it's like there's a pop-video infection out there, all movies have to be slick and fast, no time to talk no time to think, it's all action and boom, there you go again... Moviegoers are becoming addicts to this new visual style. All action movies must look like Matrix to be cool. Hell, I loved Matrix, but let's get real now okay. We even have a `matrixized' version of the three musketeers for that fashionable new look. What the hell! Let's rewind please...I'm not going to bother you with the story. It's a bank robbery but it's so much more than that. It's the story of a desperate man trying to set things straight when all has gone wrong. It's about the media exposure, it's about politics, it's about sexuality and incomprehension. It's about a society that has no answers for you and me man, a machine in motion with no soul and no forgiveness (and what a contemporary view of the world it still is today). And if you have doubts on why Al Pacino is a fantastic actor, just look at this! I don't care who you are, this man is great and always will be!Finally, if I were to choose my favorite directors I probably wouldn't remember Sidney Lumet at all. Still, Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico stand, to me, as two monuments of that big american movie-making legacy we all grew up with. A reference and a lession that movies should, at their core, be about people and the complexities of the human spirit.So, let's rewind...",

Not many classical film quotes are popular among younger generations, but these two film quotes-which come from a single actor-are among the very few that are.This fact alone speaks volumes of Al Pacino's strength as an actor, a strength matched only by few. It is also testimony of his versatility as an actor, for the characters he portrays in DOG DAY AFTERNOON and SCARFACE only have their controversiality in common.Al Pacino may be the star in DOG DAY AFTERNOON, but one must not forget that the strength of an actor's performance is a reflection of the film's entire cast and director. Al Pacino delivered extraordinary performances in these films because he worked with extraordinary people. DOG DAY AFTERNOON is a film that will stay with you.I can not conclude this opinion without mentioning the director's full name: SIDNEY LUMET. A legendary director who will, undoubtedly, only rise in appreciation. If you have not watched any of his films yet, I suggest you start with any of them.",

I assume it had the same impact on me that it did upon release for audiences at the time.This film challenged me, and made me ask questions that most movies have not:1. Why did every cop in Brooklyn show up armed and dressed to kill to a small potatoes bank robbery worth less than $1500?2. Why did Sonny not run when the riot he caused distracted everyone, from rioter to pig, to media camera people?3. Why did Attica happen? Did it cause the overreaction on this hot August afternoon?4. Why did the hostages stick around? Was it because they wanted attention, to get their '15 minutes?'Draw your own conclusions, you can infer from my sneaky premises above and below how I feel.Dog Day afternoon is the 7th best film I've ever seen, only behind master works of Melville, Kobayashi, Antonioni, and Hitchcock.If you are less than 30 in 2020, and were a young person during the Ferguson incidents in the early millennials, you'll be brought to tears in watching this, as I was.A truly relatable film for anyone who has lived in poverty as well.A line to leave you with:\n\"That guy (cop) there wants to kill me (Sonny) so bad he can taste it!\"",

Surrounded by a good cast with actors like Charles Dunning this is a good movie, though it is more about his performance than an incredible plot.I would just add that for modern times it is a bit slow; if the movie came out today, they would have cut a half hour of footage.

I can't remember now whether that's in the film or not (it's literally been DECADES since I've seen it) -- but I was looking up Pacino in another context and this one came to mind. And it all came flooding back to me from half a century ago, with the bank robber on the phone with Scott Muni at the old WNEW-FM in NYC, and me at home up at the top end of Westchester County, listening to the conversation and suddenly realizing that it was NOT a put-on. That it was really happening and some guy in a bank holdup gone wrong was on the phone talking to a DJ on what was at the time my favorite station (and the DJ played what is now one of my favorite songs of all time -- the first time I ever heard it -- a year or so later).

ALTHOUGH, the best part is also the cause of the worst: next to Pacino MOST other performances felt mundane. There were important scenes, while still great, would've been far more impactful had both actors been on the same level, rather than just being carried by one.Now I did emphasize \"most\", because there was an exception: Mulvany played by Sully Boyar. Boyar delivered a solid supporting performance, and while others beside Pacino felt bland, Boyar was able to play off of him very well and vice versa; The acting and dialogue during their intense confrontation scenes were Electrifying! -- Not really important, but Boyar was totally snubbed. Chris Sarandon (Leon) was okay (I guess), but he was not worthy of a Best Supporting Actor nom, Boyar was though.-- Anyways, in addition to Pacino's and Boyar's great performances, the film is successful at getting you to understand the criminals. By showing you Sonny's struggles, altruism, and possible mental disorder (PTSD), you're able to sympathize with, worry, and in a way root for him. There were moments throughout the film where I found myself actually becoming annoyed with the police's slick attempts at trying to capture Sonny, AND THEY'RE THE GOOD GUYS! More credit needs to be given to Sidney Lumet, whose craftsmanship was Excellent! Every new complication that arose felt organic, the developed relationship between the hostages and robbers felt believable, and the characters actions felt reasonable; nothing felt contrived.So, aside from a few uninspired performances, this film is pretty freakin' fantastic. While other bank robbery films make robbing banks out to be sexy, it's pretty refreshing and unique, to me at least, to see how one can go wrong. It's a pretty great deterrent.",

The longer you watch, the more amazed you get that it's a true story. Pacino has this skill to become a character and not himself. Several of his films get the treatment like this and this is one of them. He becomes Sonny. He has all the ticks, the mannerisms, and you feel like he's lived his whole life as the character. All of this film just works and you start to wonder how far they take it. My advice is don't look anything up while watching it. It's better without spoilers.10/10.",

Obviously, the first thought that comes to mind is, MONEY! but what's the real reason?\n\nThe story's simple, three amateur (are they really amateur though?) bank robbers plan to hold up a bank. A nice simple robbery: Walk in, take the money, and run. Unfortunately, the supposedly uncomplicated heist suddenly becomes a bizarre nightmare as everything that could go wrong does.\nI just wrote the plot synopsis that's available on IMDb because I want you to personally experience the story unfold as it throws some amazing and shocking reveals about characters one after the other whilst simultaneously making a commentary on a bank robber's psychology (how one plans it, how one manages to follow the plan, what to do if the plan goes sideways and most importantly whyyy do it???)\n\nI started this film due to me having a personal bias for Al Pacino and I think that's what made his performance in this so special for me, he just shines throughout! I cannot appreciate how much I felt for him. Never cared for a single thief in Money Heist (even though they had 5 seasons of character development) but here, felt nothing but sympathy for Sonny (Al Pacino) even when the film's barely 2 hours long! This gotta be one of his top-notch performances.\n\nThe screenplay is just briliant. Screenwriter Frank Pierson manages to reveal info to the audience at the perfect time possible (and that's a pretty hard thing to do by the way) for which he deserves extra praise. The directing of this film is also great, there are no extraordinary shots as most of the film has been shot inside the bank and the street beside but the camera work on display here is exceptional. After seeing the film, when I saw the film's production process, I learnt that most of the shot's have been captured using roller skates so as to allow mobility to Al Pacino's character which is just such a satisfying thing to know!!!\n\nThe only thing that bugs me a bit is the ending but I can't really rant anything about it since it's a true story and they intend to keep the facts as it is and maybe I was expecting more cleverness after the first two acts.\n\nOverall, a must watch film with a completely unexpected motivation for the bank robbers.",

He's desperate to make the people around him happy with their lives too. He's snapped. Is he doing this to help others, or to help himself, or for no reason other than he's lost his grip on reality? \n\nDespite his act of antisocial behavior, his antics have drawn a crowd. Not just onlookers, but participators. They happened to be in the area, and thought why not watch this scene? They've got their good guys, their bad guys \u2013 or wait, they've got their bad guys, and they've got their good guys \u2013 who do you support in a moment like this? The cops, the same cops from the Attica prison riot massacre, are trying to keep nearly a dozen hostages from being killed. And they're right to be worried. Sal is the real question mark here. The quiet ones are the dangerous ones in these altercations. You've got Sonny, venting his existential frustrations out in front of the cops, the crowd, and the universe. Like a chess piece surrounded by the enemy but protected from a distance by a checkmate blow. \n\nSonny throws money from the bank to the crowd, and they end up trampling each other and a police officer. What are we to take from that? Do we ask about why the bank has the money that the people desire enough to compete with such viciousness? Sonny himself has decided he's not going to play games to get the money he needs for the things that are important to him. \n\nThe press is there too. Making sure everyone knows that Sonny isn't heterosexual. And maybe that's the deepest part of this movie. Sal would rather be killed in a failed bank heist, with no similar motivations to Sonny's, than be even thought of as a homosexual. He hasn't said a word to anyone, and no one has seen his face outside of the bank the entire movie, but he speaks up to the FBI officer to tell him to inform the news that he's not a homosexual. \n\nSonny and Sal fought in the Vietnam war for the country, and they came back without fear of reprisal. They'd already learned that morality requires social order, and in lieu of that, the strong make the rules. The strong make the rules that suit their interests. In this way, coming home from a destabilized war zone, where military generals and guerilla warlords set the moral standards, to a stagnating society where banks and police set the moral standards, it can be no wonder that a man like Sonny, pushed to his financial and emotional breaking points, would make a decision that could change his world. It could change it for good. It could change it for bad. He and Sal decided to kill themselves if they got caught; they'd already chosen death over the lives that would await them, yet Sonny keeps seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. And I think the message is that the light isn't always real. Hope is endearing, but it can be fatal. \n\nSonny lost everything he had. He keeps his pain. His wife remained on welfare. Leon got his surgery, but Sonny didn't pay for it. And that's okay. Relationships come and go. Sometimes your suffering increases while those around you have momentum. Other times your star rises while others fall. Fate befalls us all, and the masters of society should be aware of the side-effects of marginalization. The name Dog Day Afternoon implies that Sonny had his day, after years of toil. But I don't think he did. He didn't have his day. He never will. What he did do, was pull back the curtain and glimpse the power he'd lacked throughout his life. He had the crowd, he had the private jet, and if he died, he had the assurance that his wives would be cared for. He lived, and got nothing. How's that for a moral?",

Disillusioned by Watergate and Vietnam, the country is embodied by Pacino's frantic Sonny - a veteran now left a paranoid wreck after being shaken to his core by the past few years' turmoil, and the absence of present opportunity or any promise for the future. Through him the country got to live out a communal passion for anti-authoritarianism, experience the rising LGBT consciousness and presence in the cultural mainstream, and see an unfortunate reflection staring back (Sonny isn't a perfect figure; he's noticeably very flawed, and is holding people hostage at gunpoint no matter how you interpret the situation). In Pierson's screenplay, it's evident that there are clear problems with the established order, but the methods used to combat them aren't exactly problem-free, there are no easy answers.\n\nWhat stands out is the acting talent on display, I've never seen Pacino's more manic tendencies mesh so well with the character he's portraying before. Paired up with a restrained, despondent John Cazale (who is always great, literally no exceptions) and a pair of foils in both the vaguely-inept-but-loud Sgt. Moretti (Charles Durning) and the quiet, dangerous FBI Agent Sheldon (James Broderick) as the two faces of American authority, Dog Day Afternoon is one of the better anti-authoritarian films to come out of the mid-70s cultural melting pot.

Sidney Lumet here didn't achieve the same brilliance with dialogues that Quentin Tarantino did in Reservoir Dogs and The Hateful Eight, at least to my mind. The second block has more energy, and it's almost perfect. More characters are introduced and well-developed, like Leon and Angie, the dialogues are better, the atmosphere is more thrilling and the best phrase to describe the ending is \"WTF?\". I loved how the film concluded. Besides that, the movie makes a social comment about homosexuality and transsexuality, something I would never think to see in a 1975 movie. And to crown this undeniably great picture, despite its slow rhythm, Al Pacino is perfect as Sonny: he is intelligent and smart at the same time he has no idea of what he's doing, due to his inexperience on robbery.",

It even garners the attention of the media lasting 14 hours. The FBI steps in to address the crisis. \nThe situation keeps changing as the day goes by, it appears that Sonny didn't think this all the way through. \nAt one point his mother gets wind of the whole thing and tries to appeal to him. \nThe plot thickens as one of Sonny's closest friends ends up sharing eye opening information to the police force. This makes it more clear why he needs the money badly. Even during this holdup the movie finds an unexpected hero in Sonny being as flexible as he can. He's an anti-hero but also a human being like any of us. \nThis was the quintessential 1970s movie since it reflected the tipping-point anxieties of battle-scarred and pissed-off Americans at the mid-decade mark. They even referenced the Attica 1972 prison riot that left 43 people dead. It bottled the mood of a nation, as cynicism became a normal way of life. Even a Vietnam vet can get backed into a corner when the country itself has failed and discarded him. Director Sidney Lumet crafts a tense movie and a surprisingly sympathetic anti-hero.

They had tried so hard. The problem (surely the original bank robbing couldn't have been so mishandled or eventually so boring), was that they crammed way too much resulting in a self-indulgent, labyrinthine, silly plot. A host of individual ingredients are wonderful in a banquet but, unlike the film, at such a meal we don't have to eat EVERYTHING! In this very long film, to avoid nausea, you have to leave the table early.",

Even though we came into this movie knowing it would be gold (with Al Pacino, you can't lose), Jim Cavezale as his quiet natured partner gives him a run for his money! Sadly, there is not a lot of money in this movie, and that's where things go wrong for the boys. Faced with impossible odds from this botched job, the drama that unfolds between these two brothers in crime is akin to \"Of Mice and Men\", and has a sympathetic disposition as the film exposes the personal struggles that drove them to this situation. We thought it was cool that Pacino made a popcorn connection to Gattica! We don't know why he was screaming it in this movie, but maybe they left it in cause the director is a fan of Gattica too! There was not a lot of music in this movie; it would have been nice if they gave Hanz Zimmer a call. This movie was based on real events and does deviate from the facts here and there. Its interesting that they used Sal's real name and changed the name of the main character in the movie (John Wojtowicz to Sonny Wazowski) even though John is the one who got paid for the story.  Sal got killed and John, despite failing to rob the bank, got his payday from selling this story irl. That's not cool.",

Dog Day Afternoon feels like the poor middle class screaming out in frustration at the unfair system and quality of life we are all subjected to, so in desperation, two unprepared men attempt to rob a bank with little preparation for the impending hostage situation. Frank Pierson's script is full of hilarious black humor with a morbid sense of dread. He cleverly dissects the bank robbery genre with conflicted emotions and complex motivations.\n\nSidney Lumet's direction is phenomenal in how realistic every gripping moment of Dog Day Afternoon's harrowing ordeal. It's an entertaining, funny, tragic, and absurd movie that would make for a great farce or tragic play if it were not a true story. Dede Allen's editing is very crafty for the time with long drawn out scenes followed by rapid fire cuts for emphasis. Victor J. Kemper's cinematography is stuffed with heartfelt close-ups that feel all the intimate thanks to Al Pacino's vulnerable and commanding lead performance as Sonny. You feel every moment of uncertainty and anguish from John Cazale as the disturbed and deeply troubled Sal.\n\nYou can see the insecurity and confusion passing across Pacino and Cazale's faces throughout Dog Day Afternoon. It's a beautiful story with a fondness for the LGBTQ community and people struggling with poverty. Dog Day Afternoon feels important, but it's so simple. It hits you so hard because of its moving message and down to Earth performances and Lumet's realistic direction.\n\nStop what you're doing and give Dog Day Afternoon a watch. I found it quite moving and I only hope it touches you as well.",

In Dog Day Afternoon, the bank robber trio becomes a bank robber duo within the first 10 minutes, leaving Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) to carry-out the tissue-paper-thin plan. We know these aren't professionals, as they call each other by their real names, burn papers in a trash can, thereby bringing attention to the building, and conduct their heist so late in the day that the armored truck had already come for the afternoon's pick-up \u2014 typically, robbers are so jazzed to score that they arrive too early before any transactions have taken place. It's tough to dislike Sonny and Sal, and they even strike up something of a friendship with some of their female captives, they let the security guard (John Marriot) leave when he starts showing signs of a heart attack, humorously let the women take turns using the restroom, and make sure everyone gets some pizza. When it's revealed that the whole heist, at least Sonny's cut, was to pay for the sex-change operation of his trans girlfriend, Leon, a sort of humanity takes hold and you hope at least he makes it out alive. And for a second there I really thought they were going to get away with their minuscule score \u2014 even though I knew this was based on an actual event. Didn't want to see Sal go out that way, but damn that FBI agent (Lance Henriksen) set him up good. It's considered one of Pacino's best performances, if not one of his least recognizable, and it's true, he's electric and gives a full range. You ever hear some college asshole yelling \"Attica! Attica!\" at campus safety? (Okay, that was me.) Well, this is the film the famous line comes from. I often write about how I love films that take place in an NYC I never experienced and Dog Day Afternoon falls perfectly in that category \u2014 it's the 70s, it's hot, it's violent, there's John Cazale.",

This isn't \"Set It Off\" (as entertaining as that was) - this is a biopic. And in this biopic there is a call to how those tied to the institutions of society are treated, as opposed to the those that never get the opportunity to speak. Would Sal have been given Sunny's same treatment if he too was a war vet and an incidental spokesman for homosexual activism and mental health advocacy, but purposely the director never lets the viewer get that perspective by maintaing the primary focus on Sunny as he half-heartedly attempts to pull off a bank job while really trying to become a martyr in the process to leave the institutions that he is so tied to behind, ending with him institutionalized once more while his accomplices both cowardly and brave are in their own ways set free.\n For a character penning his will in the middle of the film to throwing money at the crowd claiming he's a hero, Pacino delivers Sunny as the ultimate anti-hero for the audience : in his selfishness you can hate and relate and in his selflessness you rally around him like a saint. Only movie magic can make a story rooted in this reality this compelling and while watching \"Dog Day...\" (or nodding off on it, damn thing needed an intermission) I cant help but have my belief in fairy tales renewed while knowing this won't end pretty.",

We get to really know and understand our protagonist and his motives. Additionally, the supporting cast isn't filled with one-dimensional characters as well. The employees of the bank act accordingly and Sal played by John Cazale is always worried and uncertain of how it'll play out now that they're surrounded. The more unnoticeable aspects are executed in a manner to further the film without distracting you, such as the editing which allows for a perfect pacing of the worsening situation. Overall it isn't too fancy or huge in aspirations, but what it does accomplish with what it has is very impressive. Nice work from Sidney Lumet in directing this classic.",

What seems like a slight concept is compellingly stretched out to feature length here as we see how the plight of this one man effects those around him and the willingness of others to profit off of him and then quickly abandon him. I can't say that I loved this film but I did admire how well it was constructed and could of course appreciate the fact that the distinguished cast puts in great performances. This film was also a part of the incredible 1975 Best Picture lineup and while it is my least favorite of the five films I still find a lot to appreciate in it.\n\nFather and husband Sonny Wortzik, Al Pacino, decides to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank in an attempt to pay for the sex change of operation of his longtime lover Leon Shermer, Chris Sarandon. Accompanying him is Sal Naturale, John Cazale, who is equally inexperienced at robbing banks. When the two arrive they quickly realize that they have not adequately planned to successfully rob the bank and discover that all of the money had already been collected before they arrived. They attempt to extort the police through bargaining with the hostages and Sergeant Eugene Moretti, Charles Durning, is kind to Wortzik and attempts to diplomatically negotiate with him. Wortzik decides that he wants a plane to fly himself and Naturale out of the country to another nation and speaks to his lover and his wife before he departs. With the arrival of a new negotiator Wortzik realizes he is in over his head and tragedy strikes when he eventually reaches the airport he was meant to depart from.\n\nPacino gives one of his most famous performances as the crazed, incompetent bank robber who is driven by a deep and genuine love even as he threatens to shoot several innocent women. He uses his wild eyes to great effect here as we are absolutely convinced that he is insane but the occasional dropping in of his knowledge of the day to day operations of a bank encourage us to believe that there is a certain intelligence behind his dogged persona. He has the thick New York accent and the mannerisms that we have come to expect from him but in many ways this feels like his most naturalistic performance as he is asked to seem vulnerable even with a gun in hand and an off kilter personality. You feel for him as he talks to his lover for the last time and realizes that his love is not returned by him but terrified of him as he screams at a stuttering Carol Kane.\n\nLumet's direction is masterful, as it so often was, as he constantly reminds us of the wider implications of this event and the small scale of Wortzik's efforts to extract this money someway, somehow out of the police. He is smart to let the pacing slow down in the second act as even I was shocked by how quickly the first stages of the robbery progress. This was obviously a deliberate decision to show how, as the robbery slowed down, so did the media and public interest in the event leading Wortzik and Naturale to become burnt out and bored instead of passionated and concerned. Shockingly, Lumet never won an Academy Award and while 1975 was too competitive of a year for him to deserve the Best Director award he should have been rewarded for 12 Angry Men (1957) one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nThe end of the film is depressing as we see a man we care about die but there is a finality to this tragedy that feels in keeping with the realistic tone of the film as a whole as losing this man forces Wortzik to wake up to the reality of his situation. Yes, we get the usual postscript informing us of the fates of the many characters we followed but this was not an average bank robbery film and the characters will stay with us for a long time because while they were unsuccessful they had good intentions and their flaws were real and human.",

It is truly a great film and its reputation has only increased with time. Watch this one. 8/10 (Watch it for Lumet's crisp direction and Pacino's acting). Solaris (1971):  Stanislaw Lem's Solaris is a highly regarded book and Andrei Tarkovsky's film adaption is pretty much spot on, though Tarkovsky being an auteur brings his own touch to the proceedings. The story is about a cosmonaut who is sent to a space station revolving around a mysterious planet in the future. The cinematography and production design are haunting- the spaceship is so different than what we usually see in Hollywood. The acting is restraint and works here. Some people have said there is a sense of pretentiousness and rightfully so as some scenes go on way too long. But hey, this is Tarkovsky we speak of. This is one of the finest hard science fiction films and you should see it at any cost. (A meditative take on a famous novel).",

The action and slows down, the tension drops for a bit, and you're mesmerized to learn more about the characters pasts and personalities. In films today, such scenes would doubtless be cut out by producers.",

Sidney Lumet still needs to be a bit strict on editing part but other than that he has done a great job from his side. Al Pacino is as usual, brilliant on portraying this broken real persona and brings out the best of him without any support (he literally is a one man show in this one).

            "content": "I love the wonderful sense of New York in the 1970's that this film gives us.  The characters, dialog, and shots on location in Brooklyn are all highly authentic.  It's Al Pacino who really makes the film though, with a performance that is captivating and endearing.  He's bumbling and ill-prepared as the leader of this bank heist, yet he's cagey and street-wise as a New York rat.  \n\nWe first get a glimpse of how amateurish these criminals are when one of the three bails early on in the robbery, which is a comical moment.  We also smile at Pacino's handling of the situation.  He realizes the importance of the hostages he suddenly finds himself holding, but far from being heavy-handed, he tries to be decent with them.  He whips the crowd up into an anti-establishment frenzy by shouting \"Attica!\", throwing wads of money into the air, and paying for pizza delivery.  He gets into a shouting match with a police sergeant (Charles Durning).  He talks to his wife, mother, and transgender lover (Chris Sarandon), and each conversation is touched with pathos, and fantastic.  To his mother he says \"I'm a fuck-up and I'm an outcast. If you get near me you're gonna get it.  You're gonna get fucked over and fucked out.\"  It's the outcast underdog that we find ourselves rooting for.\n\nI love the simple acceptance of his sexuality, which is incidental and doesn't devolve into some type of stereotype - well ahead of its time.  Director Sidney Lumet shows the seamy side of New York, but at the same time, its humanity.  The characters are blunt, but understanding of one another when they simply say what they want.  The relationships in this tense stand-off are fascinating.  \n\nI also liked how Lumet gets us into the story immediately.  We learn the backstories and characters of the criminals, including Pacino's henchman (John Cazale) gradually, and in little moments, such as finding out he fears their escape plan because he's never been on an airplane before.  The film works as both a hostage drama and as a character study.  It may be a teeny bit too long at 125 minutes, but has held up well over the years, and is definitely worth watching.",

As for how the real story of his character -- a mediocre bank robber turned local TV star of the day -- is told, picture a freshly sharpened knife being used over the course of several years, still sharp enough to cut but noticeably duller. Director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Frank Pierson search to agree on a single point of view, as they examine different dimensions to the day-long tale. And in many isolated scenes, they really are on point when it comes to media scrutiny, crowd mentality, contemporary relations with authority figures, etc. Speaking of contemporary times, you gotta give some credit to the two for detailing a truthful relationship between Sonny (Pacino) and his to-be-transsexual wife Leon (Chris Sarandon). Sonny knows how to play a show, and so does Pacino. There is a catch to empathizing for Sonny, under Lumet's vision. By the ending, we lose some of the important context that Sonny and his partner Sal (John Cazale) have been holding several people as hostages for the entirety of the day, outright saying to each other that, if necessary, they are ready to kill. This is intentional for the final twist to come out of nowhere, and in its execution, a job well done. Who do I care about then? Hostages, certainly, I want them to be safe. The police, fuck them. The FBI, goddamn, fuck them! The bank robbers, um... They deserve punishment, but be easy on them...? A good true story to snag, with great dark humour bolstered by Pacino, but, if Lumet wanted to complete his analysis on small felony justice, he may have fared better by taking inspiration from the story instead.",

In the early parts of the film, I thought it was going to be a simple story about a bank robbery gone wrong. In reality, that is exactly what we get for the first act. Then things start to transition and it becomes almost a satire of how the media spins a story like this, and how people can idolize a sympathetic criminal. What I never saw coming was the explanation of why Sonny is committing the crime. That twist was hidden from us for at least half of the film, and when it is revealed it amazed me. Dog Day Afternoon was so ahead of its time, and it doesn't approach the topic in an offensive or mean-spirited way. Of course this is just a subplot to the main story, and whenever it got back to the simple hostage crisis I wasn't nearly as impressed with the movie. The conclusion had the stakes set high, and built up a lot of tension. Unfortunately, I think they telegraphed the ending a little too much, so it didn't pay off with a finale that lived up to all that came before. However, I have to hand it to Dog Day Afternoon for being progressive, and Al Pacino for delivering a superb performance.",

            "content": "If you have been a fan of any Al Pacino role and you have not seen Dog Day Afternoon, you have not yet experienced all that Al Pacino can offer. Dog Day Afternoon is by far Al Pacino's best work, and yes, I've seen The Godfather films. Sidney Lumet's 1975 feature Dog Day Afternoon showcases a depth of Al Pacino that I was unaware existed. Also starring John Cazale, Dog Day Afternoon explores the debilitating feeling of being torn in two directions by the world around you. The crisis one may confront by not being able to live their identity pushes Al Pacino's Sonny to rob a bank in order to get the money for his lover's sex-change operation. Gritty, true, and soul-crushing, Lumet proves his directorial force while bringing out the best in Al Pacino to illustrate the depths one will go through to save himself by saving those around him.\n\nOn a hot summer day in Brooklyn, New York, Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) set out to execute their plan to rob the Chase Manhattan Bank. After weeks of mulling over their plans, coordinating delivery times, casing the outside and learning the best times to attract the least amount of attention, they finally enter the bank. Sonny is at a time of extreme desperation in his life. He is in a listless marriage to his wife and two kids, and he desperately wants to rob enough money from the bank to afford his partner Leon's (Chris Sarandon) sex change operation so the two may live together full-time. Sal, the understated partner in crime, a listless man seems to have no direction in his life and is easily brought into the scheme by the promise of riches from the heist. The bank manager and teller staff agree to not interfere with the robbery, even helping the downtrodden robbers as best as they can. Thinking it will be a quick in and out affair, Sonny and Sal are rushing through the job until they realize that there is little money in the bank, as a majority of the money was taken out of the bank that same afternoon. Before they can escape, a call comes in from the police department that they have the bank surrounded. What began as a robbery quickly develops into a hostage situation as Sonny sees his plans foil all around him. Eventually, feeling sorry for the men who continuously vow not to hurt anyone, if they even could, a kinship develops between Sonny, Sal, and the bank employees. Now seeing the only way out as a jet out of the country in exchange for the safe release of hostages, Sonny unwillingly turns into a captor continuously negotiating the release of hostages and listing demands. At the depths of his own despair, Sonny prepares for the worst while hoping that he can still manage to make a life out of the mess he had before he ever stepped into the bank.\n\nThis is one of those films that you watch and you hardly realize there are any other actors in it besides Al Pacino, he steals the show that much. Within the first 10 minutes, you could see the nuance brimming over the top of Pacino's characterization of Sonny. The most incredible part of this film, which also shows the directorial prowess of Sidney Lumet was that by the 10-minute mark, the duo had already entered the bank. A film that jumps into the action so early in the film also falls victim to poor pacing, especially considering that this is a film that takes place largely in one place. The pacing was never a problem in Dog Day Afternoon; each wrenching minute that elapsed emerged the audience even deeper into the mindset of Sonny and the desperation he was experiencing. I am a huge fan of films that take place in one setting, and I never thought I would like one more than I liked 12 Angry Men, also by Sidney Lumet, (obviously it's time for me to watch even more of his films) but Dog Day Afternoon takes the crown of best one setting film, in my book anyway. One setting films are so hard to do well, oftentimes, they come off stiff or too theatre-like, but Lumet knew what he was doing behind a camera leaving audiences with the best in the genre. You feel the desperation of Pacino's portrayal in such a way that stays with you days after viewing. Dog Day Afternoon is a standout, more than earning all of its critical acclaims. What a miss for Pacino from the Academy that year!",

He's like this crazy, humorous guy that matches his expressions, he's just unbelievable in this film. The only flaw that I saw on this one, are those slow dramatic moments inside the bank which is kinda unnecessary, which still it says the side of the hostages.

And I found this movie to be great. the acting is top notch of course from Pacino and Cazale. and it is very capably directed by Sidney Lumet. the first hour of this movie is perfect from the dialogue to the attempted robbery and the great suspense that doesn't let up. however around the halfway point, the movie dragged a little bit as yiu find out more and more about Sonny as a person. certain things are revealed about his character and his motivations for the robbery, and although it is interesting and important, it slowed the pacing down a lot. the movie is also not predictable at all which is a huge plus for me personally. Overall this movie deserves to be a classic, it is great, the pacing was just a tad bit off and you don't learn much about Sal as a character which were two flaws that brought the movie down from what I was hoping would be a 10/10. still very good. \n\n7.8/10",

            "content": "The prime goal of a bank robber, besides immediate financial gain, is efficiency, and this is for a number of reasons. Nobody wants to hear the story about a successful bank robber for the very virtue that he was successful and, on that particular day, evil won. The immortalized stories and the ones that get repeated through generations, or, in this case, get movies made about them, are those that were peculiar or not-so successful. An inefficient bank robber has more of a probability of their identity being discovered, their alibi in case of indictment being compromised, or their ultimate goal of getting the money and running being corrupted by the police, who's prime goal is also efficiency. The issue is that robbing a bank can go a number of different ways and nobody really knows what will happen until it is happening.\n\nThese reasons and more are why the story of John Wojtowicz is so intriguing. Based on the true story - a story so absurd that it must be reiterated time and time again that it is indeed rooted in fact - of a bank robbery taking place in Brooklyn back in 1972, Dog Day Afternoon follows three men, Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino), his friend Sal Naturale (John Cazale), and another accomplice named Stevie (Gary Springer). The three men attempt to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank one morning, and the plan goes awry almost immediately when Stevie loses his cool and abandons the two men after Sal first draws his gun. In another unfortunate circumstance, Sonny and Sal realize they've chosen to rob the bank right after the daily cash pickup truck has arrived, meaning the bank only has around $1,000 in the vault.\n\nSonny attempts to make up for this circumstance by stealing the bank's traveler's checks and burning the bank's ledger that keeps track of all of them. The smoke from the small blaze alerts nearby businesses and law-enforcement of suspicious activities, and what was supposed to be a routine, by-the-numbers robbery becomes a hostage situation and a media spectacle. The incompetent and defeated Sonny winds up attempting to hold the young, female bank tellers hostage, as well as maintain his cool long enough to request enough supplies and transportation to get him and Sal to safety as quickly as possible.\n\nThe problem is that, throughout the course of Dog Day Afternoon, nothing happens as quickly or as conveniently for the characters as possible. The result is like watching a pathetic bank robbery put on by a band of Saturday Night Live cast members, as both Sonny and Sal are stuck between a rock and a hard place throughout the entire film. This also makes this particular film so interesting because of its constant situational humor that seems to keep building and developing as the film goes along. Nothing goes right for the characters, despite their efforts to make things work, and that's one of the fundamental building blocks of comedy that director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Frank Pierson constantly toy with.\n\nBy classification and its inherent nature, Dog Day Afternoon is a crime drama. It centers around a bank robbery and, regardless of how ill-conceived and managed such the bank robbery is, its narrative is ultimately fixated on a crime. Having said that, it's worth noting how seamlessly Lumet and Pierson interweave comedy and dry wit into the film's narrative, not turning the contents of the story into a laugh riot desperate for uproarious reactions from the audience, but allowing the pathetic characters and the poor circumstance to work for themselves and create comedy very naturally. It's only right that Al Pacino, an actor who can play both low-key and over-the-top, often in the same film, lead the cast as a character who, throughout the course of the film, looks like the personification of an unattended pot left to hopelessly boil over on the stove with nobody in sight to save or cool it down.\n\nDog Day Afternoon's sole setting and slight number of characters allows for familiarity in faces and locations to build very elegantly. Neither Lumet nor Pierson get too caught up in the spectacle of the entire event and shift the focus away from the interior meltdown to the commotion occurring outside. I'd actually be hardpressed to believe, at least after seeing this, that a short film centered around a successful bank robbery captured in one setting would be as tense as this. The unpredictability and the sheer lunacy of all that is unfolding really assist the film in creating something so crazy without gratuitous shock value that it's truly something to behold for all of its one-hundred and twenty minutes.\n\nStarring: Al Pacino, John Cazale, Gary Springer.

            "content": "\"Come on, now. Who do you think you're dealing with? A fucking idiot here?\" Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) asks the employees of the bank he's attempting to rob as he scurries about unmasked, without a plan, and with a partner (John Cazale) who thinks Wyoming is a country.  If he didn't have such a big gun and wasn't in such a reckless emotional state, then I might, if in the shoes of the head teller, respond with a hard yes.  But I'm a nice guy without enough good sense to avoid messing with the slightly unhinged - to sit back and bathe in the pathetic events of this criminal train wreck might be better for my health instead.\n\tAs audiences, we have grown accustomed to robbery-based films that glide by with lightweight finesse, the cinematic population consisting of a few too many \"Thomas Crown Affairs\" and \"Italian Jobs\" to prove that, in actuality, most crooks are bumbling, not suave.  So it's no surprise that \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is based on real events - in the nonfictional world, slippery Steve McQueens and Michael Caines do not exist.  We are, unfortunately, stuck with unbalanced Al Pacinos who leave us ripping out hair out rather than ricocheting back in fear of their sinful prowess.  \n\tSonny is a man acting out of desperation, not rationality, and that's what makes \"Dog Day Afternoon\" such an enormously involving film; it is more concerned with why the guilty parties are so bent on committing high-attention theft than on the crime itself.      Sonny is not a playboy nor a mastermind but a perpetual loser whose life is all work and no play - it is a workout to simply psychologically ready himself to wake up in the morning.  He is party to a failed marriage and a party to a dying extramarital affair; but Sonny, it seems, is more driven by the latter, as it acts as his motive for robbing a bank.  His lover (Chris Sarandon) is in dire need of money to fund a sex change operation.\n\tIt doesn't take long for the robbery to turn into an event, as Sonny isn't much subtle and catches the eye of a group of policemen perched across the street - minutes later is a crowd attracted, the hold-up becoming a major hostage situation.  The public loves him: they see him as an anti-hero standing up for the 99% (until his sexuality is revealed and they turn into a body of jeerers).  But two dim-witted men cannot hinder the movement of bank tellers for very long - especially considering the FBI soon camps out in front of the building - and Sonny is eventually forced to come to terms with his reality, and how an act of spontaneity is no way to go about changing one's life.\n\tBest about \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is its cockeyed humor; robbing a bank and threatening to kill a group of vulnerable women is no joke, but it sees the human comedy that forms when society's most prominent outcasts get it through their heads that they can emulate Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid without a blueprint in mind.  No one in the film actually feels threatened.  They are so entertained by the spectacle that surrounds them that even the hostages themselves are having a good time.  \"My place is with my girls,\" the head teller replies to a cop who pricks her with the idea of the opportunity to run away from the building in hopes of escape.  She sounds heroic, but she likes the attention of the media, and Sonny is not enough of a threat to make her want to discover safety.  Similar is a pizza delivery boy who shows up at the front steps of the bank to serve Sonny and company's dinner; \"I'm a star!\" he shouts after he collects his cash.\n\tI suppose \"Dog Day Afternoon\" could be looked at as a biting media commentary, but it is more compelling of a film when viewed as a character study.  It begins with the tone of a black comedy, but little by little is the sheer tragedy of the situation revealed, particularly when we meet Sonny's lover for the first time.  Then and there, we come to understand just how parched Sonny is for some sort of a normal life.  Not committing a crime is not a thought that passes through his head.  He can only see the end result, which is a crooked view of happiness that even he can't seem to understand will never arrive.\n\tPacino, at his most formidable in the mid-1970s, gives one of his greatest performances in \"Dog Day Afternoon,\" though his characterization can hardly be called a \"performance\": he becomes Sonny, not with actor contrivance but with ease encapsulated by a mere twitch of an eyebrow.  Charles Durning, as the lead detective who does most of the negotiating, is excellent as a man not concerned enough to take extreme measures but concerned enough to sacrifice his reputation for the safety of Sonny's hostages.  Most startling, though, is Sarandon, whose uncanny ability to portray an underlying hurt causes our hearts to ache as he makes up for the judgment Sonny so heartily lacks.  \n\tCinema has changed a lot since the 1970s, and one can only wonder just how much of a success a modern-day film equivalent would be - are present audiences as capable of absorbing a gripping character study that never changes location, that relies solely on a handful of accomplished actors? \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is an intricate configuration of what Sidney Lumet does best: finding entertainment, consolidation, sympathy, in people.",

            "content": "After seeing it on the big screen for the first time, one thing I took away from the film when I reflected on it was that this film is similar to early Spielberg works in a way.\n\nWhat I mean by that is I read a book on interviews done with Spielberg, which touched on the idea that his early work revolved around stories where the media was involved somehow; the media looking at the event was an undertone of the film. In Dog Day Afternoon we get these aerial shots of Sonny outside the bank that captures what an event this was to the public - hundreds of extras as policemen, the media and the general public trying to catch a glimpse of the excitement of a bank robbery.\n\nSonny even becomes an icon to the public when he says he doesn't want people killed, and gets people in an uproar when he reminds them of a similar situation in Attica (I believe) a short time ago. We see the people's reactions change as it is revealed that he has homosexual lover; some give him hate but he draws the attraction of the gay community.\n\nAnd these people aren't even inside with him as we are, missing out on how he acts in person. We see a performance by Pacino that cries out desperate and excitable in the best of ways. We see him stumble over problem after problem with the robbery, but he refuses to give up. He's a smart guy, having worked at a bank before, so it breaks him when his foolproof plan goes haywire in all sorts of directions.\n\nJohn Cazale is also in this film, and from what I have seen him in I say that he is a very underrated actor; without saying much in the film he has to pull of his character with subtleties, not exaggerations, and he does this very well. His best scene in the film is when he is being accused of being a hypocrite since he thinks the body should be protected since it is god's temple, yet he is in the process of robbing a bank.\n\nThe film seems to drag at points with overly long sequences leading up to when transportation to an aircraft arrives for them. That doesn't mean these sequences lack content; there is a great moment when Sonny is making his will in case he dies before getting on a plane, but it feels like we wait half an hour between steps to his plan. Also, I was unimpressed by the actor who plays Sonny's lover.\n\nMy friend pointed out that this film is somewhat anti-climactic but I didn't really think a big climax was necessary for this film, though I get his point. This is a great work of art that makes me want to watch more of Lumet's work in the near future, such as 12 Angry Men or Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.",

            "content": "It's nigh impossible to think of this movie without one word ringing like a Church Bell inside your head over and over: Attica! Attica! Attica! Shouted relatively early on during its running time, it is arguably the most deeply resonant element from a movie made way back when the heady optimism of the 60s Hippie era was dead and buried. In a decade when the common man was at a loss at every step, our main character Sonny, played with all with the right notes by Hollywood heavyweight Al Pacino, is the embodiment of that misfortune, and along with his hapless partner Sal, a very understated John Cazale, robs a bank in broad daylight, and things seem doomed from the get-go.  Sidney Lumet crafts a movie which is funny, suspenseful, claustrophobic, and constantly keeps you guessing which way it's going to swing. Pacino is electrifying as the leading man who goes from petty thief to folk hero in record time, and you can see why the masses would love such a character. One of the primary strengths of the movie is that we see the action from both sides: The robbers and the authorities, and are constantly forced to question who are the 'good' guys and who are the 'bad', and if such a line can be so clearly drawn. The movie opens with a frenetic energy, and if it could sustain that throughout the film it would be mind-blowing. Alas, the film begins to drag as it becomes evident there isn't enough story or action to fill its rather excessive length, and so we are forced to endure some unnecessarily long scenes and even longer exchanges of dialogue. It does get fairly boring, but the positives are just too good to ignore. The first half of the film alone is worth the price of admission. The second half, not so much.",

Unlike most heist films nothing goes to plan for Sonny and his dim witted sidekick Sal, arriving at a bank with no money their great heist quickly falls apart leaving Sonny to try scheme his way out whilst having no intentions to hurt anybody. Arguably one of Pacino greatest roles we see the characters depth as his reasons for the attempted bank robbery are revealed as well as a deeply tortured soul. The film shows the exploitation of the media industry, as we discover more of Sonny's humanity the media turns him from Robin Hood anti hero with the onlookers cheering him on, to a crazed blood thirsty mob mocking his sexuality and condemning his actions.

The fact that this bank robbery scene actually happened is what makes the movie more compelling to watch, especially the fact that it happened in Brooklyn, New York 1972, and where else better to have a crazy bank robbery in New York, where the most impossible happens. Al Pacino gives without a doubt one of his most best and iconic performances ever in Sidney Lumet's \"Dog Day Afternoon.\" Sidney Lumet is no joke of a director, after wtaching \"Serpico\" today I thought I would give \"Dog Day Afternnoon\" another shot since I had mixed feeling about it when I first saw it, but I was just a kid then driven on action flicks, but now seeing it as a young adult I can say this is without a doubt one of the best movies EVER made. The time period for the film is captured so well and the performances between Pacino, John Cazale (Who always amazes me) Chalres Durning has the New York hostage negotiator to even Chris Sarandon who plays Pacino's gay lover Leon, to hell even having Lance Henricksen as the FBI agent that drives Pacino, Cazale and the hostages to JFK Airport with the rtest of the hostages is enough for me as a movie buff to love this movies especially since it is so well directed by Sidney Lumet who I desperately have to start getting into after watching \"Dog Day Afternoon\" again. This is a movie that keeps you glued to your seat from beginning to end and truly deserves to be in the ranks of the 100 best Hollywood movies ever made. This was made during ther Golden Age of Hollywood as I truly believe the 60's and the 70's was the best time for movie making as so many memorable movies came out around then. \"Dirty Harry,\" \"Apocalypse Now,\" \"The Godfather Part 1&2\" \"Saturday Night Fever,\" \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" but that's just the 70's but you get the point. But there is something about \"Dog Day Afternoon\" that just sticks in the back of your mind when you watch it because it truly is a remarkable film and deserves to be one of the best American movies ever made and no one can take anything from that....not even the FBI\n agents in this movie lol.",

Working as a dramatic thriller, a love story, a riveting character study, penetrating expos\u00c3 (C) of a media feeding frenzy and a poignant statement on the American sociopolitical landscape of the early '70s, Afternoon makes Pacino's bank-robbing fuck-up extraordinarily moving. Masterfully constructed by one of cinema's most eclectic directors, Lumet's extraordinary lengths to make film feel as natural as possible (No score, eye-level camera work, and a largely improvised script) adds nail-biting tension, and a true you-are-really-there sense of realism.

            "content": "Sidney Lumet is the master of making a fantastic drama out of something that takes place in one location and Al Pacino is the master of giving outstanding performances and never winning anything for it. Dog Day Afternoon is a great film where everything goes wrong for our characters in the first 5 minutes and it only gets worse from there.\n\nWhether or not this film sticks to what actually happened, and from what I've read- it doesn't, the film feels very real, it has a documentary style feel to it all and it makes it feel very authentic. For the first 20-30 minutes, at least, it looks like a continuous shot and again it feels very authentic, it looks like we are watching a real bank robbery happen where everything goes wrong, so the filmmakers did their job fantastically. I also like how there is no music, it just increases the realism, even to the point where the end credits happen and they just appear. \n\nAl Pacino knocks it out of the park by doing something a little different and does a fantastic job, and has our undivided attention. His accent was very good just like everything he was doing, a lot of the film was improvised and added to the script later (which was a good idea because they won their only Oscar for the script) and it comes across on screen in the best of ways. Not that its badly made but the fact that Sonny needs to think of everything on the spot comes across great and we're left wondering what could go wrong next. It's perfect casting, not only because he does a brilliant job but because he looks like the real Wojtowicz, which he was actually compared to when the robbery happened. It's also a fair portrayal, we get to see why he's doing this and really gains a lot of sympathy. I think Durning should have been nominated for an Oscar, he gave a great performance and worked with Pacino great. Sarandon also did a great job and I liked the build up to his character and his eventual reveal, it's subtle and surprising. John Cazale was good as usual... For what they gave him.\n\nWhile we get to understand Sonny and see why he's doing what he's doing, John Cazale almost had nothing to do and we really don't learn anything about his character at all. We get snippets here and there and a very touching scene about cancer because of what happened to him but he's really underdeveloped. While that might be true to what happened in the real robbery and he wasn't really the focus of the event, it doesn't make for a good character. I also think the film was too long, it was around the hour forty mark that I thought this but I can't really think of any scene to take out, those scenes are important to the plot and nothing in this film is filler. It tells its story and ends straight away. \n\nDog Day Afternoon is a very impressive film that actually has quite a few nice surprises in store, given some of the subject matter, it is a very respectful and quite impressive thing that was accomplished in 1970s cinema. One character laughs at something Sarandon's says and everyone looked at the guy that laughed in shock and I really liked that moment. With great acting and directing, Dog Day Afternoon tells its odd story in the best of ways.",

            "content": "August 22, 1972-Two young men hold up Brooklyn's Chase Manhattan Bank at closing time. What begins smoothly quickly goes awry, leading partners-in-crime Sonny Wortzik and Salvatore \"Sal\" Naturale to inadvertently take the bank's employees hostage in a desperate attempt to escape the 200 policemen surrounding the building. The media immediately gets involved, allowing locals to immerse themselves in the melodrama and use it as a distraction from the late summer heat wave. A crowd of intrigued onlookers swarms the bank, observing the ongoing events and loudly expressing their reactions in equal parts cheers and jeers. Sonny finds himself in a position of celebrity, a would-be spokesman for the workingman, fed up with union wages and discontent with what his country has to offer him. His initial popularity vanishes when his supporters instantly turn on him after a local news station exposes his homosexuality and reveals that the motivating factor behind his criminal behavior is to fund his partner's sex change. \nThis dramatization of real-life events comprises the narrative of Sidney Lumet's 1975 film, Dog Day Afternoon, a \"naturalistic\" work that sits firmly within the pantheon of 70s cinema (Hollywood's \"Golden Age\"), a genre of films made between 1967-1976 that is defined by omnipresent themes of isolation, hopelessness and disbelief in the American Dream. In an era when \"movies mattered,\" filmmakers chose projects that responded to and commented upon the defining cultural and political aspects of the time. Elements of these films included French New Wave stylism and neo-Western narratives, typically following morally ambiguous (often male) protagonists to an ambivalent conclusion and conveying nihilistic themes along the way. Late 60s counterculture had an obvious impact on the genre, as many 70s films carry overt anti-authority messaging, Dog Day Afternoon included. \nA perfect storm of changes within the studio system and America's cultural climate allowed for this renaissance of filmmaking to occur. As a self-censoring industry, Hollywood once had a strict Production Code, which subsequently fell apart in 1966, allowing for more grown-up films to make it into the multiplexes. Simultaneously, Hollywood began to alter the ways it financed its movies and allowed directors more creative control over projects. The Production Code and studio system provided little room for \"auteurs\" (Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock stand as notable exceptions), so Hollywood directors with distinctive styles did not emerge until the late 60s. Around the same time, the audience for films began to gear toward the younger \"rock n' roll\" generation, so morally ambiguous screenplays covering subject matter such as pot-smoking drifters (e.g. Easy Rider) suddenly looked much more lucrative to producers.\n  By the time Dog Day Afternoon came around, Americans had survived a decade of social division in response to the Vietnam War, perpetual loss of trust in American politicians (and authorities) due to Nixon and-of most relevance to this particular film-crippling economic recession. The first two of these trends could not have unfolded the way they did without the sensationalism of modern media (notable moments include the Tet Offensive and the live broadcast of Nixon's Watergate testimony), a development that forever changed American culture. The instant celebrityhood attained by news coverage even managed to incentivize criminal behavior, leading fame-hungry individuals to commit acts of violence in exchange for notoriety.\n\tBased upon a 1972 LIFE article entitled \"The Boys in the Bank,\" Dog Day Afternoon contrasts the media's portrayal of events with the deeper realities that actually comprise them. Within the film, the media presents to the public a bizarre tale of a homosexual gone mad. Lumet's camera instead exposes a deeply human portrayal of a desperate man trying to support his loved ones, and for the first time in his life, be somebody. This instantly accessible humanity goes on full display to reveal the media's corruptive ability to alter events and sway public opinion. As Roger Ebert wrote in his original review of the film, \"The presence of reporters and live TV cameras changed the nature of those events, helped to dictate them, made them into happenings with their own internal logic\" (Chicago Sun-Times). Lumet attempts to capture all of this and more with Dog Day Afternoon.\nBorn in Philadelphia but raised in New York City, Sidney Lumet began acting at five years old, appearing in Yiddish theatre productions that his father produced and directed. He would later study acting at Columbia University and direct Off-Broadway plays for a few years before moving onto television in 1950 during the dawn of the so-called \"Golden Age of Television,\" a breeding ground for many of the key players in 70s cinema. \"Lumet has suggested that the key to his talent as a director may well be his origins as an actor,\" Joanna E. Rapf writes in her compilation book, Sidney Lumet: Interviews. This background likely contributed to his reputation as an \"actor's director,\" or someone who could \"deliver powerhouse performances from lead actors, and fine work from character actors\" (Thomson). This skillset, and his working relationship with New York City (an omnipresent character in 70s film) catapulted Lumet into the top tier of directors with the help of a string of successful films, including 12 Angry Men, The Pawnbroker and Serpico. Lumet's varied choices in directorial projects quickly established his fierce \"anti-auteurship,\" with which he denounced the idea that \"good\" directors need to have their own recognizable style. Perhaps fittingly, several critics have pointed to Lumet's lack of noticeable aesthetic as a weakness in his skillset. \nWhen Lumet initially chose to take on Frank Pierson's screenplay in 1974, he had reached the point in his career where he not only had great freedom in choosing his projects, but he also held the coveted right of \"final cut,\" the privilege of deciding-without studio interference-which cut of a film got released to theatres. \"I'm pretty sure that if I want a new writer on the script, the studio or producer would let me pick one,\" Lumet writes in his autobiography. \"Final cut is a tremendous source of security\" (Lumet 48). To give a sense of Lumet's clout at the time, fewer than a dozen people working in Hollywood held this privilege. His critical and commercial success up to this point secured studio funding for Dog Day Afternoon with relative ease-no small accomplishment, and this at a time when producer Robert Evans had to fight bullishly to get Chinatown made. \nIn the original LIFE magazine article, journalist P.F. Kluge describes John Wojitowicz (Sonny) as \"a dark, thin fellow with the broken-faced good looks of an Al Pacino or Dustin Hoffman\" (Kluge). By 1974, each of these actors had already contributed heavily to the mythos of 70s cinema, Hoffman with The Graduate and Midnight Cowboy and Pacino with the first two Godfather films. Having worked with him on Serpico in 1973, Lumet cast Pacino in the part of Sonny. \"It was a remarkable group. Pacino led them with a mad courage I've seen only two other times,\" Lumet writes (Lumet 33). One of the earliest Hollywood stars to subscribe to the \"Method\" school of acting, Pacino had shown time and time again his ability to embody characters right down to their smallest tendencies, from Frank Serpico's pervasive paranoia and androgynous swagger to Sonny nervously toying with his pocket watch. By juxtaposing his vastly different performances in Godfather Part II and Dog Day Afternoon, released within a year of one another, one can begin to comprehend the dedication young Pacino had to his craft. He and Hoffman, among others, made way for a new type of leading man in an industry that had historically only hired those who fit the bill of \"Hollywood Handsome\" (e.g. James Dean, Cary Grant).\nAfter securing the role of Sonny, Pacino insisted on the casting of his friend John Cazale as Sal despite the actor's twenty-year age difference with his real-life counterpart. As a character actor, Cazale had already turned in a remarkably consistent body of work, having played habitual screw-up Fredo Corleone in the first two Godfather films and Harry Caul's (Gene Hackman) starry-eyed coworker in The Conversation. Lumet then chose relative newcomer Chris Sarandon to portray Leon, a gamble that clearly paid off, as he received an Academy Award nomination for his performance. To contribute to the film's naturalistic feel, Lumet cast untrained actors as bystanders and even as minor supporting characters, including the pizza delivery boy who famously proclaims, \"I'm a star!\"\nLumet continued to round out the important positions in his crew with formidable 70s figures, including editor Dede Allen, who had established her tendencies for innovative, New Wave-style cuts in films such as Bonnie and Clyde and Serpico. Lumet had developed a close relationship with the renowned editor on the latter film, as the two worked closely to edit it concurrently with production to meet time constraints set by the studio (Lumet). Finally, Lumet chose Victor Kemper (The Friends of Eddie Coyle) as his Director of Photography to \"reinforce the film's documentary feel\" (Lumet 89). Despite complaints from the studio, Lumet chose not to commission a score for the film, as he felt he could not \"justify music weaving in and out\" of a project designed to imitate real life (Rapf). As a result, the film's only music comes in the form of Elton John's \"Amoreena\" during the opening credits.\nLumet's significant amount of creative control led to some tensions with studio executives and screenwriter Frank Pierson. \"You have euchred us!\" an anonymous production manager yelled at Lumet through the telephone (Lumet 35). He expressed anger over a scene the director had chosen to cut from the script, which included footage of Sonny and Leon's real-life counterparts' wedding. Lumet thought it would inspire too much sensationalism and render audiences incapable of relating to Sonny, while the studio saw it as a marketing opportunity to build up the film's notoriety (A common tactic; just a few years earlier Midnight Cowboy sold tickets using the tagline, \"Whatever you've heard about Midnight Cowboy is true.\").  Final cut allowed Lumet to have his way, and he replaced the footage with a picture of Leon in his wedding dress. \n\t\"The first obligation was to let the audience know that this event actually happened,\" Lumet said of Dog Day Afternoon's distinct visual style, though he may as well have been talking about Pierson's screenplay (Lumet 88). Lumet and the cast improvised upwards of 60 percent of the film's dialogue during table reads, a staggering amount, but a decision that led to naturalistic characterizations by each of the key players. It also provided for much of the film's trademark humor. Legend has it that Cazale improvised his \"Wyoming\" line, which acts both as a recurring joke and an effective bit of character development. Lumet even left a few scenes (including Pacino's infamous \"Attica\" speech) for improvisation on the day of shooting. Of course, all of these improvisations resulted in an almost complete rewrite of Pierson's original dialogue. People commonly joke about writers getting slapped around in Hollywood, but Lumet insists that \"[Pierson] was selfless and devoted to the subject matter. The actors may not have said exactly what he wrote, but they spoke with his intention\" (Lumet 34). Lumet calling the shots on set may have allowed for a more holistic take on the material, but the other players' contributions should not be underestimated. Pierson won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay and, according to Lumet, \"he deserved it\" (Lumet 34). \n\tUpon its September 1975 release, Dog Day Afternoon received almost universal acclaim from the major critics, with much of the praise falling upon the film's darkly hilarious dialogue and Pacino's moving performance as Sonny. \"The interactions between Pacino and other key characters are magnificently written, acted and directed,\" writes the staff of Variety. Pacino had established himself as something of a critic's delight by this point, having earned their allegiance early on with his performance as a heroin addict in 1971's The Panic in Needle Park. \"[Sonny] becomes one of the most interesting modern movie characters, ranking with Gene Hackman's eavesdropper in The Conversation and Jack Nicholson's Bobby Dupea in Five Easy Pieces,\" writes Roger Ebert (Chicago Sun-Times). The film went on to earn five Academy Award nominations, including one for Pacino, though its only win was for Pierson's screenplay. The film found box office success as well, capitalizing on its broad and timely cultural appeal to earn $50 million off of a $1.8 million budget (Lumet became notorious for finishing productions under budget, having picked up a tendency for thrift during his time spent working in television.). The movie holds up to this day, and stands tall as some of Sidney Lumet's finest and most culturally impactful work, providing poignant commentary on the modern era's exploitative media and the humanness behind seemingly absurd behavior.  \n\"The televised image certifies the reality of events and, at the same time, removes them by equating their meaning to that of the commercials-the cheerful haiku-that frames them.\"-Vincent Canby; New York Times\n\tCanby included the above piece of wisdom in his 1969 review of Medium Cool, an extraordinarily meta film about the media's role in inciting politically-charged events. I would argue that it applies more accurately to Dog Day Afternoon, in which a man finds both a voice and an audience by lashing out at the world, only to realize that his actions represent little more than a distracting freak show on the periphery of a hot summer afternoon. The public values him and Sal based upon their entertainment value and little else. The local media feeds this furnace of exploitation to feverish heights for the sake of its own ratings, simultaneously piquing the public's interest in the story and preventing them from seeing the relatable truths behind it. The public sees a man madly screaming \"Attica!\" and hurling money at riotous crowds. They see a man crazy enough to have a drag marriage presided by a defrocked priest. What they do not see is Sonny Wortzik, a loving husband and father who grew disenchanted with life and wanted one last shot at changing things for himself and for others. \n\tLumet wastes no time in setting the tone for this humanization, opening the film with a montage of everyday events in order to achieve the opposite effect of the media's sensationalism. The five-minute opening credit sequence (featuring the aforementioned \"Amoreena,\" a moseying tune with lyrics about everyday life) serves to set the film's overall feeling of normalcy. Instead of building up tension toward the bank robbery, we barely even notice when it has started. As city noises begin to drown out the music, Lumet transitions seamlessly from hidden-camera footage of New York City to a shot of Sonny, Sal and Stevie sitting in a car outside the bank. \"They seemed like just one more shot of a group of people on that oppressive summer day in New York,\" writes Lumet (Lumet 57). This visual aesthetic provides the viewer with no choice but to acknowledge that these are normal people, not unlike the ones shown immediately beforehand. \n\tWhile much debate amongst film academics goes into the definitions of Realism and Expressionism, Lumet has said that Dog Day Afternoon's aesthetic falls more along the lines of \"naturalism,\" or \"as close to documentary filmmaking as one can get in a scripted movie\" (Lumet 54). In some ways, this approach provides for fewer esoteric conversations regarding shot composition and imagery. It makes Dog Day Afternoon entirely different from a more expressionist work like Citizen Kane, in which nearly every freeze frame tells a subliminal story. Lumet and Kemper craft a visual narrative that observes the characters and events without necessarily commenting on them; the camera draws as little attention to itself as possible. This commitment to naturalism demanded that Lumet and Kemper use no artificial lighting (the only lights used to shoot inside the bank were the ceiling fluorescents), shoot exclusively on location and-for many of the indoor sequences-use handheld cameras. They could have easily shot the film in a more conventional manner complete with neorealist imagery and archetypes, but Lumet believes that style stems from \"organic connection to the material\" (Lumet 51). Of course, for him, this meant a visual story that matched the narrative one, which itself shows the humanity behind a so-called freak. He could not further sensationalize Sonny's actions. On the contrary, he attempted to reverse the damage the media had already done. \n \tAs the credit sequence comes to its conclusion, we find ourselves observing what quickly establishes itself as a bank robbery. Stevie (Gary Springer) walks casually, hands-in-pockets back to a beat-up car in which Sonny and Sal sit. He says something inaudible to Sonny, who proceeds to shut off the radio (implying the characters could hear \"Amoreena,\" yet another example of Lumet's dedication to naturalism), prompting Sal to walk up to the bank, take one more look back at the car for self-assurance, and enter the building. Exterior shots of the bank show its guard (John Marriott) lowering the flag and locking the doors behind customers, implying that the bank will soon close for the day. Sonny-with a suspiciously long package under his arm-and Stevie enter the bank, putting in motion history's most prolonged failure of a heist. \n\tThese early moments with our protagonists prove instrumental both in terms of characterization and in making obvious their impending doom. As Lumet writes, \"Inevitability is the key... The script must keep you off balance, keep you surprised, entertained, involved, and yet, when the denouement is reached, still give you the sense that the story had to turn out that way\" (Lumet 31). Sonny and Sal hurdle toward their self-made ruin, which makes itself obvious as soon as the former fumbles around when withdrawing his rifle from its packaging. Sal projects a stoic intensity that seems to suggest barbarism akin to that of Hannibal Lecter, but will later reveal itself as something else entirely. Stevie then gets cold feet and-in a move surely designed to establish the film's comedic tone-rushes out without even thinking to leave the keys to the getaway car with Sonny. All of hope of a successful robbery seems lost, but wait! Sonny quickly goes about reestablishing a cool professionalism that matches his two-piece suit. He makes a series of quick-witted moves, suggesting an intelligence that seems contradictory to his already long list of screw-ups. \"We'll just move it right along,\" Sonny says repeatedly, presumably to reassure Sal and himself that they are still in control of the situation. Pacino runs back and forth across the bank floor with a bug-eyed intensity, drawing the blinds then blacking out the cameras to prevent video transmission. When the bank manager goes to open the vault, Sonny barks at him not to trip the alarm using the \"spot key.\" A spot key? How many people know what that is, let alone how to differentiate it from the real key? He similarly rejects the head teller's (Penelope Allen) attempt at giving him decoy money. Sonny soon reveals that he used to work in a bank and that he is a \"Catholic so [he] doesn't want to hurt anybody,\" thus flipping the audience's initial assumptions about him and quickly turning him into a puzzle that the viewer is asked to dissect. \"Sonny is many things and wants to be all things,\" Ebert writes (Chicago Sun-Times). Sonny seems to think this of himself as well; he at one point declares, \"I know a lot about a lot of things.\" Lumet and Co. proceed to reveal those \"things\" to the viewer in a manner befitting of the film's quasi-documentary trappings.\n\tAs previously stated, the film makes obvious the bank robbery's failure to the viewers, even if they are not aware of the events it is based upon. After burning the registry in another example of his recurring foolishness, Sonny gets a phone call from a group of policemen in the building across the street. \"We've got you right by the balls,\" says Sergeant Eugene Moretti (Charles Durning). \"You don't believe me? I'm looking at you right now. Right now I can see you.\" An immediate look of panic in his eyes, Sonny glances through the window and sees a stereotypically fattened cop pointing at him. While the screenplay does not reveal how the cops came to know of the robbery, Kluge's original story details a conversation in which Mulvaney (Sully Boyar) sends a coded SOS while on the phone with a client. As Moretti and Sonny converse, the camera does not immediately opt for the standard reverse-angle shots that filmmakers usually use to dramatize conversations, but instead stays with Sonny to keep the faux-documentary's focus consistent. \"Look, I told you to get out of here while you could, but you just had to hang around,\" barks Mulvaney. Sonny and Sal drop to the ground in despair, but their story has hardly begun, and is yet to become media frenzy. \nAs the narrative progresses, Sonny and Sal's character development occurs in two arcs that seem to contradict one another: via their exchanges with the other characters and the local media's (as well as the authorities') attempts to uncover their backstories. Lumet's viewers get to know the complex man that Sonny is simply by observing his uneven behavior. He first tells the police that he will \"start throwing bodies out the front door\" if they approach the bank and uses his status as a Vietnam War veteran (supposedly, though this is likely untrue of Sal since he admits to never having flown in an airplane) to validate this threat, but he then allows the bank's employees to take phone calls with their loved ones and even use the bathroom. \"He's the kind of man who would take care of you,\" Pierson once said of Sonny (Rapf). Sonny verifies this statement repeatedly, as he makes sure to cater to his \"hostages,\" even going as far as to order them pizza and teach them rifle twirling. Sal's seemingly ice-cold demeanor similarly fails to hold up under scrutiny once he reveals his silence to simply be isolation when he suggests that he and Sonny shoot themselves. The accessibility of these two becomes even more apparent once Sonny calls into question his own opinion about whether or not the authorities are the good guys. \"They'll shoot you, you know? The cops...you see what they did in Attica? 42 people they killed, the innocent with the guilty\" he says to Mulvaney. The film seems to affirm this point when, just a few minutes later, incompetent police officers nearly shoot an asthmatic security guard as he exits the bank. \nAt this moment, the turning point occurs in which the media makes Sonny into a local celebrity, giving him the power to captivate the attention of nearly everyone in New York City. Meaningful high-angle shots show both police and media helicopters alike flying overhead, symbolically linking the two. The camera cuts to Pacino, who barks back and forth with Moretti in one of the most intense improvised confrontations ever set to film. In the meantime, buses full of armed policemen arrive, adding to the purposefully absurd number of them already on the scene. Realizing he can call the shots for perhaps the first time in his life, Sonny runs back and forth like a Shakespearean protagonist delivering his soliloquy. \"Get back there!\" he yells, pointing at a cop. \"He wants to kill me so bad he can taste it! Attica! Attica! Tell them to put their guns down! Put your guns down!\" The newly formed mob cheers, screaming \"Attica\" in call and response. Then, in an oft-overlooked but powerful moment, Sonny proclaims, \"If it wasn't for the TV guys they'd kill us all!\" In a perfect example of intentional sequencing, the film then cuts to Sonny's parents watching the news coverage on television, affirming that the media does in fact alter the course of events for everyone involved. Sonny's mother was watching live coverage of her son's tragic downfall from the comfort of her own living room. This serves to reveal to the film's viewers an essential component of Sonny's character (his Freudian mother issues) while contrasting this inside knowledge with what the news anchor tells the public. This type of juxtaposition occurs again after Pacino's second outdoor demonstration. Lumet chooses to cut to Sonny's wife Angie Wortzik at home with her two kids, ranting about how crazy her husband has been acting lately. The pieces of his character start to come together for the film's viewers, but the public still sees only a charismatic bank robber. Sonny has become an instant celebrity, impregnable because of the public's irrational obsession with him. He feels the power this gives him and capitalizes upon it as much as possible, needlessly yelling slander at the policemen to draw a response from the crowd. Even the bank's head teller panders to the audience when Moretti tries to keep her outside. \"They're my girls, I'm going back in there!\" she says, with a smile and a wave to the laughing crowd. She excitedly runs back into the bank to brag to her \"girls\" about her live television interview. If this wholesome, maternal character is controlled by a desire for any small amount of fame, then surely all of us are. \nSonny soon recognizes that he does not possess a real voice to speak to the people, as evidenced by his declaration to a newscaster: \"I'm here with my partner and nine other people, and we're dying, man. You're going to see our brains on the sidewalk. They're going to spill our guts out, and you're going to show that on television, have all your housewives watch it instead of As the World Turns?\" Sonny knows that he and Sal represent a freak show to the public and little else.\n Small bits of character development continue to occur within the bank, including Sal's insistence that cigarettes \"taint the temple of the Lord,\" but the true shock to the film's viewers as well as to the onlookers within the film comes when Leon arrives. It's important that Lumet and Co. choose to deliver this information to both audiences at once. The film's viewers find themselves shocked at first, just like the mob of onlookers, but we then get the joy of peeling back the layers of Sonny's complexity. We see the media's coverage of the revelation and the aforementioned photo of Leon in his wedding dress. The newscaster then cuts to a commercial break and says, \"We'll be right back with coverage of two homosexuals robbing a bank.\" In a particularly funny reaction, Sal whines to Sonny about the false reporting. The news station has no basis to assume Sal was also gay, and yet they say it anyway to stoke the public's interest in the event. As Bob Dylan famously said in an interview with Time magazine, \"They've got too much to lose by printing the truth...you know that!\"\nIn Dog Day Afternoon's tragic last act, Lumet allows the viewer to more fully comprehend Sonny's motivations, imbuing the character with nearly universal accessibility in order to critique the media's dangerous tendency to distort the reality behind events. The camera follows Sonny through a sequence of two phone calls: one to Leon, and the second to his wife Angie. The first is a desperate plea for forgiveness, an apology for failure and a sorrowful goodbye, while the second is resentfully done out of a sense of obligation (\"the kind of man who would take care of you\"). With Leon, we feel Sonny's love come through in an honest and affecting way, as the back-and-forth close-ups of Sarandon and Pacino tell a powerful narrative simply via facial expressions. Lumet filmed this scene twice in back-to-back unbroken takes to build up Pacino's level of emotion as much as possible. \"By the end of the second take, Al didn't know where he was anymore,\" Lumet writes. \"His eyes locked into mine and he burst into tears, then slumped over the desk he had been sitting at\" (Lumet 122). This level of raw emotion provokes a visceral reaction in the viewer, creating an instant sense of connectedness to Sonny that is more deeply personal than anything the media could ever convey, as if it would ever want to. The similarly affecting Last Will speech that Pacino delivers serves the same function of providing insight to the film's viewers that the mob outside the bank could not hope to comprehend. At this point, their sole relationship to the event is still just the initial shock of learning about Sonny's homosexuality. Visually, we see this when-after the phone call scene-the camera cuts to the street, where gay rights activists chant \"Out of the closets and into the streets!\" Viewers of the film can see the depths of Sonny's complexity, but the public remains fixated on his sexuality because of the media's sensationalist coverage. \n\tMany people would argue that the film's most important message lies in its anti-establishment ideals, which make themselves apparent in the portrayal of the police force as inept public servants who oppress the people. The cops' stupidity shines through on multiple occasions, including when they let an angry bystander through the barricade to tackle Sonny, or when the tactical unit behind the bank fails to communicate to the ones out front that they are going to try to sneak through the back window. This messaging culminates with the film's denouement, when a lieutenant brutally shoots Sal-with whom the audience sympathizes-in the face (A conscious decision on Lumet's part to alter what happened in real life, in which they shot him in the chest). I do not argue against this reading of the film, as I think it works alongside my critique of modern media to comprise effective social commentary. However, I do believe that Dog Day Afternoon functions best as a critique of the media's sensationalism and man's obsession with fame. It is a deeply human portrayal of someone whom the public may mistakenly label an outcast, or as Lumet puts it, \"Freaks are not the freaks we think they are. We are much more connected to the most outrageous behavior than we know or admit\" (Lumet 14).",

In the lead role, Al Pacino is absolutely killer and you can really feel the nerves, frustration, and exasperation, that he feels without even having to hear him say a thing. John Cazale is also great as the slightly unhinged accomplice who Sonny (Pacino) has to try to keep under wraps. I also really enjoyed the news footage look to it, considering the story became a major news spectacle, so it was as if we were simply watching the story on the news or a documentary after the fact (especially considering the story was based on a true story).\n\nMy main complaint with this one would probably be that it slowed down a bit in parts, but whenever it picked up again, thoughts of those slower moments disappeared, so it was not a major issue for me at all. Yet, it is definitely worth mentioning.",

A brilliant movie, and a mesmerizing Al Pacino. If u thought he was spectacular in GF I, II, and Scarface....then just watch him in Dog Day Afternoon. Quite simply one of the greatest performances in movie history. Definitely my favorite. The depth with which he plays Sonny is such a treat to watch that I lost count of how many times he left me in AWE. There's this indescribable nervous energy to his performance that there's no way he'll leave u NOT feeling sorry for Sonny.\n\nSadly, for some reason this movie is kinda forgotten when discussing Al's greatest movies/performances. That's because not many people have watched it. So please, if u consider yourself a movie fan, then go rent DDA and watch a fine movie with the legendary Al Pacino performing his art at the absolute peak of his career.  5 stars   8-20-13",

Director Sidney Lumet (who was nominated for Best Director) did an unique portrayal of directing a bank robbery gone wrong & its eventual hostage situation, all the while the characters are starting to deal with life on one side, death on the other side, & choice(s) in-between the two.

But then there's Al Pacino, whose performance is so adrenaline-filled and emotionally palpable that it catapults this film from great to a masterpiece deserving of classic status and every bit of acclaim it gets. This is a near perfect film, and it's influence is well-deserved and very apparent in today's heist and thriller films.

You truly see Al Pacino's character Sonny nerves, will, and patience be tested in this movie. Overall the movie is slow to start and lengthy, so it's not a movie you would causally watch.",

The events that conspire are based on actual happenings and that just makes the movie experience more enjoyable.  This is more than a film, it is a social statement.  The cast does an excellent job of bringing this to life despite the fact that they worked in a very limited film setting. The main protagonists Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) attempt to rob a bank only to find that they are surrounded by NYPD within minutes of the thefts commencement.  Dog Day Afternoon takes place almost entirely in this New York bank and that is really one of its major strengths.  Direction from Sidney Lument makes the audience feel like they are in the bank with Sonny and his hostages.  During the film I often felt that I was Sonny, just trying to think of a way to get out of this extremely difficult situation.  Al Pacino contributes to this film with an always dependable performance.  He brings Sonny to life.  Combine this with a realistic script and an excellent plot and you have the cinematic experience that is Dog Day Afternoon.  Though this film is primarily a thriller with some funny moments, it is also a tragic drama about the consequences that come with violating the law.  If there is one theme in Dog Day Afternoon it is that crime does not pay.  I would recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys a good thriller/drama and an overall quality movie experience.",

Sunny and his band of robbers become more like rock stars than robbers to the people outside the bank watching as the police try to negotiate with them.\n\nWhile Dog Day Afternoon isn't action packed or fast paced, it's a classic film that everyone should see at least once.

The movie's screenplay was just terrific because it had a really interesting story that had me invested while also having some great characters and some great dialogue. Sidney Lumet does Pierson's screenplay justice because he did a fantastic job directing this film. Lumet did a great job at creating suspense in this movie but he also did a good job at balancing the drama in the film and the humor in the film. In this film you have Al Pacino as the star and he is just brilliant. Pacino is just a terrific actor and he just knocks it out of the park in this film. To me Pacino's performance in Dog Day Afternoon is one of the best performances of his entire career. The supporting cast is also magnificent in the film which includes John Cazale, Chris Sarandon, and Charles Durning. Overall Dog Day Afternoon is a terrific film that I highly recommend seeing.",

Dog Day Afternoon follows a man named Sonny Wortzik (Pacino) so desperate for cash he attempts to rob a bank along with his friend Sal (John Cazale). A job which was suppose to take minutes turns into a downard spiral for the pair as they can't escape from a sticky situation.\nThe film is absoloutly exhilarating from start to finish, Sonny is an amazing human being to say he is robbing a bank you can't help but sympathise with his life story which unfolds throughout the film, to back this up the hostages move around freely and seem to enjoy the antics. As for Sal his character seems very on edge, a ticking time bomb waiting to unleash chaos. The chemistry between the Al and Johnny is very realistic and i really did route for the two to make it out alive.\nWhat i thought of the plot is that it was almos too spoofed to be true. Fans was cheering Sonny's name as he came outside to negotiate with the cop, Sonny really was infectious in his human spirit to the point the cops was humbled in his presence. Sonny was so in control of a what seemed a ridicoulous situation that it seemed unreal to be a true story.\nOverall Dog Day Afternoon is an absoloutle thrill ride, an amazing film with references to a french new wave cinematic style giving the film the sense of realism in time and space with helicopter shots and energetic shots. This film for me is a sentimental piece of art which should be enjoyed by women and men alike due to the social issues the film implies, racism, sexuality and equality.",

            "content": "I knew (before watching) that this film had had its fair share of critical acclaim and I was keen to give it a look. There\u00e2(TM)s something in the title that conjures a picture in my mind of a violent bank siege; boy was I in for a surprise! It is most definitely not what I was expecting\u00e2\u00a6 so slow I had to keep checking my pulse to see if I was still alive! Don\u00e2(TM)t get me wrong, I\u00e2(TM)m all for a slow paced taught drama, but this one didn\u00e2(TM)t really work for me. I\u00e2(TM)ll tell you why after this very brief summary.\n\nWhen Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) rob a bank in Brooklyn on August 22nd 1972 they get more than they bargained for. Based on a true story, the events of the day slowly unfold. The men take too long getting out and find themselves trapped in the bank with several hostages. The manager, Mulvaney (Sully Boyar) is very cooperative, as is the chief teller, Sylvia (Penelope Allen); even so, the police are soon in touch in the guise of Moretti (Charles Durning). What follows is the usual thing; promises made in return for a hostage or two. Before they know it there are large crowds outside and the whole thing has become a media circus with Sonny even being interviewed by phone live on the air! As all this is going on we learn more about Sonny\u00e2(TM)s life and his motivations for committing this crime. As things progress the FBI takes over the negotiations in the form of Sheldon (James Broderick). He is much more with the programme and events begin to move more quickly. Is there a way out for these men though?\n\nQuite a daring film for its day, showing events almost exclusively from the point of view of the robbers. There seems to be a little Stockholm Syndrome going on where the hostages begin to identify with their captors, but this isn\u00e2(TM)t explored too closely. All the performances are very good with Pacino doing some of his very best scenery chewing with Cazale consequently playing it down and very understated (I liked that). It didn\u00e2(TM)t work for me though because I never bought into the stories we learn about Sonny; it\u00e2(TM)s him the film concentrates on mostly. He seems quite savvy when it comes to banks and police/FBI procedures and yet still panics when the police first arrive. I never had any connection with for either of the robbers and so found it quite a bumpy road to go down. Having said that I thought it was well made but certain scenes came across like a bit of an improvised scene in an acting class. I doubt I\u00e2(TM)d watch it again, but at least it\u00e2(TM)s another I can cross off \u00e2~The List\u00e2(TM).\n\nSteelMonster\u00e2(TM)s verdict: RECOMMENDED (\u00e2\u00a6just)\n\nMy score: 6.1/10",

Directed in a sophisticated direction by Sidney Lumet and lead strongly by Al Pacino, Dog Day Afternoon starts strong and never lets up.\n\nBeginning with an intense mood and varying in intensity throughout the whole story, the only real flaw in Dog Day Afternoon is the inconsistency of the pacing and the occasional simplicity of the situations.\nThat being said, Dog Day Afternoon turns a simple bank robbery into a dramatic tale. Sidney Lumet directs the bank robbery in several directions and situations and he ensures they all hit hard. The screenplay is also very strong here and supports the actors as well as the movement of the film.\n\nThe Acting is the high point of Dog Day Afternoon. Chris Sarandon's flamboyant and emotional portrayal of Leon was very good, and next to it was John Cazale as  a haunting, introverted character.\nThe Best part, however was the intense and loud performance given by Al Pacino. As flawless as ever, Al Pacino gives a performance of Sunny so finely that it's one of his greatest. It's loud, it's conflicting, it's intense, it's AL PACINO! He blends elements of Tony Montana and Michael Corleone into this one, and when he shouts \"ATTICA! ATTICA!\", thats the moment you realize he is perfect for the role.\n\nDog Day Afternoon features dynamics used fairly commonly in films now, so to see one of the earliest portrayal of such events in Dog Day Afternoon is great.",

I can't find anything wrong with the actual making of the movie. I'm usually a sucker for \"based\" on a true story movies. This one is even considered to be very accurate. Props to Sidney Lumet and the writers for taking a run of the mill news story and making it a darn excellent movie. The movie only lost a star because of the back story behind it. This was just some bum off the street, and he died a bum living with his mom despite the money he made from the story.

What makes this film interesting is that the man was gay and was married twice.  Also he got the community hating and loving him at the same time.  The mom, the wife, the gay wife who needed a gender operation, all great characters. \r\n\r\nA great film, definitely worth a watch, probably not going to watch it again though.  The performances are probably the strongest thing about this film.  Everything else is solid but not amazing.",

Two bank robbers run into some outrageous hiccups while robbing the bank. An accomplice backed out in the last minute. One bank robber tries to be smart and burns a register in a bin. The smoke attracts a passer-by, risking being caught. After going through all the trouble, the bank vault is actually left with a small sum of money only. Then, without a clue, they are on national TV, surrounded by police, TV media reporters, a huge crowd and ... gay supporters. Al Pacino's character is a bisexual who is married to a chubby woman with two kids and has a guy he claims to be his wife. He robs the bank for his sex change operation. It is afterall a comedy?\n\nNot really. The second half sees the movie declines into darker depths. It ends in a tragedy. I really hope the movie will end with a lighter note. It feels unbalanced. \n\nBased on true events so I kind of cannot complain much. \n\nRating: B",

The movie has a great plot, Al Pacino's character and his friend rob a bank, Al Pacino's character, Sonny, wants it for his gay lovers sex change, you know, turning his lover into a woman... Point is the movie's still amazing. It's one of those movies that I could watch a billion times. Absolutely brilliant! The way all the hostages are all having' fun and enjoying themselves while Sonny and his friend are holding them 'hostage', yeah, they don't want to hurt any of the hostages, and they don't, they treat them very nice, they aren't really criminals, just people that sadly need a lot of money, and that is makes you feel for them and feel bad, they don't mean bad, but they need money, and that made me feel like it was realistic. And I LOVED the way all the towns people agreed with Sonny. The movie itself felt very real, I could imagine watching the news and seeing Al Pacino holding hostages, except the hostages weren't being tortured, they were having a decent time!

Al Pacino is great as the clumsy, yet determined bank robber, who became sort of a celebrity through all his wrongdoings. While the robbery doesn't go as planned, Sonny slowly shows his true self, as his insatiate desire to become a star exceeds the urge to steal the money. Unfortunately, his friend Sam isn't as strong and charismatic. He starts to crack, and feels weaker and weaker every minute, and wants for this nightmare to end. And it ends, but not nearly as perfect as the boys imagined. A clever play on cliches, with an emphasis put on the society's reaction to a horrible event, which actually comes as more entertaining that harrowing in the final evaluation.

IThis is a very tense film, with good dialogue. Your constantly unsure of how things will develop, plot wise and obviously what the ultimate outcome will be for the hostages, as well as the two rather quirky main characters, Sonny and Sal. I found myself feeling empathy towards both the hostages and the hostage takers, which isn't always the case in such films. I found it particularly engrossing due to having read that its based on a true story - the film being based on a magazine article. I found it interesting the relationship between the police and Sonny, as the situation developed. I found myself questioning the actions of the police at times, in as much as there are numerous scenes with Sonny just outside the bank entrance, in clear view of the police and snipers, whereby I'd have thought it would have been pretty quick and easy to shoot him down and knowing its an American film, I was surprised that the authorities weren't more gun-ho. This is very much a character driven film and I felt there was a good amount of character development, with some witty dialogue thrown in. I thought this film was quite engrossing - its very tense at times and was certainly an easy and entertaining watch. I liked that the female hostages came across as generally quite sharp-tongued and certainly not very ditzy, which is good to see, given the fact its a 70s film. If anything, the main characters of Sonny and Sal come across as having more vulnerabilities than the bank staff, who keep their fear(s) to themselves.This is a tense and engrossing film and the fact its, if in part, based on a true story, made it more intriguing a watch for me. I felt the performances were especially good and I liked the character development and plot pace, although if im to be overly critical then I suppose I may question the response (or lack of at times) of the authorities. I'm happy to recommend this film as a good example of a crime drama/bank heist based film, with good performances.",

This study is highlighted all the more by one of Al Pacino's best performances alongside that of the under-appreciated Joe Casale.\u2028 Given the year of 1975 that this film was made, as well as being based off of a true news article in 1972, the film can be interpreted as a post-Vietnam whiplash effect on the American public (particularly the youth).",

When I'm being f**ked, I like to get kissed a lot.\u201dDog Day Afternoon is a fantastic 'bank robbery gone wrong' movie, but becomes so much more than that.I\u2019ve been planning on watching this movie for awhile, but failed each time. Now it makes me appreciate my patience after finally checking it out at LIFF (Leeds International Film Festival). Seeing this on a big screen rather than a small one made the experience even more special.The run time of two hours and 30 minutes, which is crazy because none of it dragged. I loved every minute of it. I was surprised how comedic it is, as I originally expected it to be a crime drama. It's hilarious seeing the hostages who were scared at first, but eventually got so comfortable around the robbers, they toy with their semi-auto rimfire rifles. Even ordering pizza and sodas, and Sonny (Pacino) pays for it with bank money.Al Pacino is one of the all time greats. His voice, facial tics, walk, hunch, accent, etc. There\u2019s so much to pick up on his performance. He\u2019s better than sex. John Cazale is a national treasure and left us way too soon. The chemistry between Sonny and Sal is dynamic. Sidney Lumet directing captives the entire event and makes it absolutely gripping, especially the climax which had me on edge.Pacino is fire. Cazale is holy. Sidney is god.",

So, when I found out about this film, where it plays the lead role and it's still a robbery, I said to myself, why the hell. Al Pacino is simply the best movie gangster / mobster / robber. He just plays crime to number one. That's my opinion of the actors. Back to the movie. He won't let you wait long and we will find ourselves at the scene in the first minutes and the robbery begins. Fast pace. No planning. From the beginning, something happens all the time. After a while, however, the film will slow down, so if you are not interested in this topic or this event, which was filmed in truth, then it will probably not be very lively for you to watch. But for me a great film that I recommend.",
