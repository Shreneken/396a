            "content": "No director ever personalized a genre the way John Huston could. While some critics have claimed his style was a 'lack' of style, the opposite is actually true; his sense of irony, love of the absurd, respect for personal codes of honor, and twist endings that always remind us that the true value of a journey is not arriving at a destination, but in the 'getting there' all set apart his best work from that of his contemporaries. Even his lesser work has value, and his best films, which certainly includes THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING, are unforgettable.The tragicomic tale of two ex-Sergeants turned confidence men with a grand scheme to fleece a near-legendary kingdom had been a 'pet' project of Huston's since the forties, and he'd spent years tinkering with the script, planning to film it with Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the leads. With Bogart's death in 1957, he'd considered various other match-ups (including Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole), until he found the ideal pair, in Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Connery had just finished the spectacular THE WIND AND THE LION (in which Huston played a small, but memorable role), and the Scot had often been compared to Gable with his dark good looks, machismo, and lack of pretense. Michael Caine, a long-time friend of Connery, was one of the industry's busiest actors, and had already proved himself adept at playing both soldiers and con men. Together, Connery and Caine had a camaraderie and chemistry that even Gable and Bogart couldn't have equaled, and Huston was \"quite pleased\".Christopher Plummer was another inspired piece of casting, as the legendary author Rudyard Kipling. Bookish, with a keen intellect and rich sense of humor, Plummer's Kipling, sharing Masonic ties with the future 'Kings', is the perfect foil for the duo, offering sound advice which they totally disregard, with a wink and a smile. As Dravot (Connery) tells him, \"We are not little men\", and India, bound up in British bureaucracy (as well as becoming too 'hot' for them) could never provide the immensity of riches they dreamed of.Huston eschewed the 'traditional' approach to adventure films, with cardboard heroes performing near-impossible deeds until the inevitable 'happy ending', and grounded his story in reality, which disappointed any viewers hoping KING would simply be a variation of GUNGA DIN. But in not romanticizing the story, he gives it a sense of immensity and the exotic, a richness of character, and an understanding of human frailties that far surpasses a typical Hollywood product. While Dravot orchestrates the pair's ultimate ruin by taking his 'godhood' too seriously (as he turns 'noble', trying to bring order to his 'kingdom', and decides to start a dynasty by taking a wife), you can understand why Carnehan (Caine), seeing their 'get rich' scheme disintegrate, would be anxious to leave, but also why he would forgive his friend, when they face torture and certain death. Loyalty, to Huston, is not lip service, but a true measure of a man. While Dravot and Carnehan are certainly not role models, their love and respect for each other transcends their faults, even their lives, putting the film's final scene, as a physically crushed Carnehan leaves his 'bundle' for Kipling, into perspective. It is a moment you won't soon forget.\nTHE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING proves, yet again, why John Huston, as he once described his friend, Humphrey Bogart, is \"irreplaceable\".",

            "content": "Ruyard Kipling's epic of splendor , spectacle and high adventure at the top of a legendary world. It begins with some words which Rudyard Kipling pens in the opening scene are the opening lines to an actual Kipling poem, \"The Ballad of Boh da Thone\" that contains several elements which feature in the movie . The flick tells the tale of Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery's favorite film character , though John Huston also considered Richard Burton) and Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine , though also was deemed Peter O'Toole) , two ex-soldiers in India when it was under British rule. Kipling (Christopher Plummer would have been dismissed early on by the producers but for Sean Connery's insistence that Plummer stay) who is seen as an important role that was there at the beginning and the ending , he advised about a dangerous journey . They decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan , a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander . There Daniel becomes a king and attempts to marry a princess (Shakira Caine, this is the only feature film to co-star Michael Caine and wife) under High Priest Kafu Selim (Karroom Ben Bouih was 103 years old when he made his first and only film appearance , when he saw some of the footage he declared that now he would live on forever.Long live and spectacular adventure with an extraordinary duo , Connery and Caine , they form the best pair of all time . A glorious tale with two heroes who head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right . John Huston tried to launch the film version of \"The Man Who Would Be King\" many times before completing it . It was originally conceived as a vehicle for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the fifties, and later as a vehicle for Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. When it was considered as a vehicle for Robert Redford and Paul Newman, Newman suggested Sean Connery and Michael Caine . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Oswald Morris filmed in Pinewood studios with magnificent production design by Alexandre Trauner and shot on location Glen Canyon, Utah, USA , Grande Mont\u00e9e, Mont-Blanc, Chamonix , France ,Atlas Mountains, Morocco and at the Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou, just north of the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate ; this site was used in Gladiator as the North-African arena where Maximus first fights. Ouarzazate is known as \"Morocco's Hollywood\" since many international productions - such as Kingdom of Heaven and The Hills Have Eyes - were shot in the area. Imaginative as well as sensitive musical score composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre .The motion picture well produced by John Foreman was stunningly by the great John Huston at his best . The picture was made in a good time of the 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City, (1972), The man who would be king (1975) and Wise blood (1979). He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano (1984), the afore-mentioned Honor of Prizzi (1985) and Dublineses (1987). Rating : Above average , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to adventure film . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie , providing classic scenes and unforgettable dialogs .",

While blackmailing a local Raj, the pair are exposed by author Rudyard Kipling and brought before an officer.  They are warned but released.  Later the visit Kipling to get him to witness a contract for their latest plan \u0096 to become kings of a small country by training a village to conquer the rest of the villages and then leave months later with riches.  The conquest begins in earnest, but when Danny's vigour in battle makes him appear to be a god to the villagers new dangers are introduced.I have seen two interviews recently with the two leads (separately) and both time clips of this film were shown that made me think `I must watch that again'.  Come Christmas and the repeats on all channels gave me the chance to see it.  I had forgotten just how funny the film is and it really helps the film to be an enjoyable adventure to add to the dark edges.  The plot is from a Kipling story so it is of a good stock and stands up well.  The addition of humour is well pitched and really helps.It is a great adventure story, with a cautionary twist in the tale and can be enjoyed on all levels.  The directing is as good as you'd hope from Huston but what really made the film for me was the two leads on top form. Both Connery and Caine have a great chemistry and totally convince as the old school military types.  They bring the roles to life and make them enjoyable and get us behind them effortlessly.  Admittedly most of the support cast are only jabbering natives who aren't allowed characters with the odd exception.  Plummer is good in a minor role but this is the Connery/Caine show all the way.Overall this is a great story that is well told by director Huston.  The film is made even better by the gentle camaraderie between Connery and Caine and the good vein of humour that underpins the strong story and quite downbeat climax to Caine's story.",

Second, all other \"buddy films\" are simply comedies. And while the Man Who Would Be King has some laughs in it, and Connery and Caine bounce off of each other almost as good as Abbott and Costello, the story itself is a drama. And what a drama it is. Two English soldiers set out to be the rulers of a country, but can anyone who was a grunt one day, and a king the next, become a King without getting an inflated ego? The answer is no and that becomes the ultimate test for these two friends. Terrific performances by Caine, Connery and even Christopher Plummer, who gives a brief, but good performance as Rudyard Kipling, the man who wrote the short story this film was based on. This film features perhaps the greatest ending to a movie ever made. You will never forget it, and you will wish that you had a friendship as strong as these two individuals.",

            "content": "Based on a short story by Rudyard Kipling, The Man Who Would Be King tells the story of two friends; Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine) and Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery) that go to Kafiristan in order to rule the country as kings and become rich in the process. The tale itself if relatively simple, but through great storytelling, the film is lifted into the realms of the masterpiece. The Man Who Would Be King tells a story on two levels; on the one hand, it's an epic masterpiece, spanning across Asia and embracing the Eastern culture, but on the other hand; it's a simple tale of two friends that are out for all they can get. The film switches between the two sides of it's story with great ease, and the smaller, more intimate side of the story is actually complimented by the epic battle sequences that run alongside it.This movie is headed by two of the very finest actors of all time - Sean Connery and Michael Caine (both British too, I might add). The two have a great chemistry, and seeing them on screen together is an absolute treat. Both actors have a very defined style as to how they act and how their lines are delivered; in fact, they're perhaps two of the most defined styles ever, and they play off each brilliantly to give fantastic performances in this movie. Michael Caine always seems to be more willing to give a better performance when he is on screen with another fine actor, and they don't come much finer than Sean Connery. The great John Huston directs the movie, and this is easily one of his best movies. In fact, I rate it as his number one colour film. He's got a good story to work with, and he makes the best of it, not to mention that he gets the best from his cast. Many of the locations are fabulous and the battle sequences, although not on the same scale as some other films of the same nature, are well choreographed and an epic sense is captured through the utilisation of many extras.This film is a masterpiece. All the players have come together to create a film that is both intimate, intelligent, interesting and on a massive scale all at the same time. A must see.",

The film looks wonderful, with evocative locations and stunning cinematography. Maurice Jarre's score is very stirring, and while not his best(Lawrence of Arabia) it is up there. The script is sly, the story is riveting, the pace is spot on and the ending gives another meaning to the word pathos.

It is in Eastern Afghanistan next to Chitral, which is in Northwest Pakistan.Place names in the movie, such as Kamdesh and Bashgal, are real places in Nuristan. The explorer Robertson, whom Billy Fish reports has having died, did not die in real life but was rescued by a British military force in 1895, after Kipling wrote his story.The people of Nuristan are believed to be descendants of Alexander the Great, who came there in 328 BC, just as the movie states. They had a pagan religion as the movie describes until they were forcibly converted to Islam in 1892. There are still some believers of the old religion in the Kalash Valleys of Pakistan.For more about these people see http://www.samsloan.com/damik.htmI know about all this because I have been there and I married a woman named Honzagool there.

However, the main thrust of the narrative concerns the exploits of two ex-army rogues and their efforts to rule a remote corner of a kingdom that lies in modern day Afghanistan.The film itself is an out and out comedy and both Michael Caine and Sean Connery play it to the hilt as the impossible to dislike scoundrels. Watching the story unfold, you're aware that it can only end in disaster but that doesn't make the telling of it any the less entertaining. It's refreshingly old-fashioned in that the story evolves from the nuances of the two leads and that they're far from the clear-cut heroes of many lesser adventure films.It's also worth singling out Saeed Jaffrey in his role as the loyal Billy Fish - an excellent supporting performance if ever there was one.",

            "content": "My friend threw this DVD at my head one night while we were arguing about film. I said all adventure movies left me feeling a little hollow - adventure movies tended to abandon story, really, in favor of plot (important distinction: stories are interesting, plots boring; consequently a film with a story to tell is better than a movie with a plot to move forward). I think he hurled the disc at me out of pure frustration with my point of view. In doing so, he also won the argument.The Man Who Would Be King is the single greatest adventure film I've ever seen. It's a story - It's a tale - It's not a series of plot developments (to me, to go further with this plot/story dichotomy, a plot is mechanical (and sometimes that machine is well-oiled) while a story is organic and feels less contrived (though the story, as organic matter sometimes is, can be rotten)). It's a very good story at that. The Man Who Would Be King (I believe as a result of its derivation from Kipling) has a depth and development of character that is foreign to most adventure tales. Few films are as rousing as this and few films that are this rousing have nearly as much to say about mankind.John Huston, of course, is a master of instilling greatness into traditionally tedious genres. He transformed the mystery, the western, the swashbuckler. Why not the adventure story too? As evidenced in The Maltese Falcon and Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Huston can take what might wind up a plot and transform it into a story. He understands that characters - human, conflicted, devious characters - are essential to creating genre pictures that transcend their genre. Without Huston, this film would have undoubtedly faltered; his steady and determined hand guides this film from the hazards of superficiality without sacrificing entertainment and adventure.He does not create a great film single-handedly though, as Connery and Caine, who both give tremendous performances, bestow upon Peachy and Daniel immense likability despite their scoundrel airs. Caine proves again why he may be the greatest living British actor and Connery reminds us that there's more to him than 007.As I said, this is one of the greatest adventure tales brought to the screen. Though some may disagree, in particular my friend who threw the DVD at my head, it's better than any of the late 30s swashbucklers and better than most shoot-em-ups made since.",

Huston's films so often include that quintessential scene -- the one where his characters realize that they've lost everything, and respond with unbridled true character. Those who cry or bemoan the loss are beyond redemption.  But those who can laugh in the face of disaster, who can ask forgiveness for the patently unforgivable -- they are the greatest of Huston's figures, and perhaps the greatest characters of cinema.  Just as Bogart and Hepburn laugh while they lie in the bottom of a boat awaiting death, Michael Caine and Sean Connery face certain death in this film and respond with complete honesty and complete honor.  For all of their lies and arrogant ambitions, they are still a pair of b*****ds you would love to know.Which brings me to the two incredible performances.  It is nearly impossible for such recognizable actors to fade into the guise of their characters. But Caine and Connery manage it, and with perfect aplomb.  As best friends, they are perfectly inseparable, and their innate connection makes for one of the most affecting male friendships in history.  Surrounded, with no reasonable hope in the world, Danny asks Peachy to forgive him for being \"so bleeding high and so bloody mighty.\" And, of course, Peachy forgives him.

But his winners are first-rate. I'll only mention \"The Maltese Falcon,\" \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,\" and \"The African Queen\" in passing. Hardly anybody seems to be turning out well-crafted work like this anymore, pieces in which plot, character, and atmosphere cohere.\"The Man Who Would Be King\" is a fine example of Huston at or near his best. It is completely without pretense -- a kind of blustering, masculine, tragicomedy with two superb actors in the leads and fine support by Christopher Plummer as Brother Kipling. Nothing that Caine or Connery feel seems to be more than an inch deep. Stranded on a snowy mountaintop in the Hindu Kush, they sit around a dying campfire discussing how they're going to kill themselves, since they will otherwise slowly freeze to death. \"Let's wait till the fire goes out,\" suggests Caine, \"and I'll do the necessary.\" Connery muses, \"Peachy, do you think our lives have been misspent?\" \"Well,\" replies Caine, \"I wouldn't say the world is a better place for our having been IN it.\" They start laughing as they reminisce, provoking a life-saving snow avalanche.They are clever, treacherous, greedy, and very human. They've taken a serious vow against the use of women or liquor until they've completed their plan of robbing some remote tribe of natives \"six ways from Sunday.\" Learning that they have no interest in sleeping with his daughters, a friendly chieftain suggests that maybe some boys would do the trick, sending the heroes into a Victorian dudgeon.I can't carry on much more about the jokes or about the underlying theme, which is pretty sad. Hubris, the Greeks would have called it, defying the gods and presuming to rise above your station. The lawyers might have called it lex loci. Having been proclaimed king, Connery tells Caine, \"I'll be going now. You mortals remain outside.\" Connery breaks his vow where women are concerned and marries the lusciously exotic Roxanne (Caine's wife at the time). The spirit grew ever weaker and the flesh was all too willing.Neither Caine nor Connery has ever disgraced or damaged a movie they've been in, although the reverse hasn't always been the case. They're not exactly heroes here, either. Huston and his writers were unsentimental. The two are racists. Caine throws an affable Indian gentleman off the train -- \"Outside, Baboo!\" -- and Huston treats it as a comic incident. That unapologetic lack of political correctness also spares us any nonsense about noble savages. Each of the isolated mountain tribes complains about the next tribe living upstream that they wait until the local women are bathing or doing laundry in the river, then they pee into the river. Offered the title of \"Ootah The Great,\" one chief grumbles and says he'd prefer to be known as \"Ootah the Terrible.\" It would have been easy to sentimentalize these people, a bit of teaching of Oriental Wisdom, \"a man's reach should not exceed his grasp,\" or \"all things in moderation,\" or some such nonsense, but we don't get it here. These are pretty rough dudes who play ball with the heads of their enemies.In trying to capitalize on the success of this movie, the company brought out a \"novelization\", which turned the screenplay into a novel, as if Kipling had never lived to write the original story. (Talk about barbarism!)I could watch this a hundred times and still marvel at Connery's mastery of the military style of speech when he says lines like, \"There'll be no summary executions in THIS ah-my!\" And, \"Sorry about that. Blood was up. Won't happen again.\" He does it at least as well as Nigel Greene, Harry Andrews, or Jack Hawkins -- those mess hall terminal contours.Don't miss it.",

They're a pair of lovable con artists who nearly pull off one big old swindle and take over an ancient inaccessible kingdom in the Afghan mountains.This was a labor of love for John Huston. As a kid he read Rudyard Kipling's famous short story and it became his favorite work of fiction. Huston as far back as the Fifties wanted to film this first with Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart and then later on with Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole. Try and picture this story done with either of those combinations.Huston even worked Kipling himself into the act with a fine small cameo by Christopher Plummer. Kipling who was a newspaper correspondent covering the British in India, is told this wild tale about what these two did in the forbidden land of Kaffiristan.These are the kind of people Kipling himself knew well from the British army in India which back in the day was its own entity and a great tradition of military glory albeit in an imperialist cause. For American audiences just think of Connery and Caine as a couple of GIs recently finished with their service.I think I understand their characters. What would Connery and Caine be back in civilian life if they returned to the United Kingdom? No one terribly important no doubt. They've spent time in India, learned a lot about the language and customs and want to turn some profit in it, doing something really big. It's a dream we can all identify with, but few of us have the gumption to see it through.Connery and Caine give some of their best screen performances in The Man Who Would Be king. This film became both a critical and box office success for John Huston, his first really big smash hit in a long time. It holds up well today and will for all time to come.",

            "content": "John Huston must know, equally, how great and how damn flawed man can be. A lot of his films- some might say the bulk of his oeuvre- focuses on this, from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre to Moby Dick. Sometimes, it might seem, a man has both the writhing worm of ambition and promise and the potential for complete failure in a single bound. He excels at this, not because he has to but because he needs to tell these stories of men like this - his heroes were manly male stories by the likes of Melville, Kipling, Hemingway and Hammett, but one can also sense the spark of criticism, of questioning what makes such men the way they are. The Man Who Would be King is no exception, and may be the pinnacle of such a tale, where we see two men, formerly failed soldiers, make themselves into the rulers of a nothing country right off of Afghanistan in the 19th century - one of them becomes a God by luck (or destiny) - and how it eventually ruins them. Whether Huston's film, by way of Kipling's story, is meant as a cautionary tale or a wicked satire (or maybe both), it's still tremendous storytelling, acting, direction and musical composition, etc. In the film, two ex-soldiers of the Royal English Army are in India, Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery) and Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine). They both tell the impressed if a little doubtful Rudyard Kipling himself, merely a journalist at the time (Christopher Plummer by the way), that they, being pretty much without any real place to go or things to do as disgraced soldiers (lots of crimes such as theft and blackmail), have a plan: to go to Kafiristan, which is a country few know exists and hasn't been inhabited by any kind of real ruler since Alexander the Great. In short, a great place to rule and take charge with their skills as soldiers.After braving the terrain, in some brief but effective scenes showing how much of a duo Draven and Peachy are in battling the weather and a few stray wanderers, they arrive at the country, which is in shambles, and they train some of the locals to fight their way against their rules (the one guy who is sort of, kinda ruling things wants \"Terrible\" to follow his name, not \"Great\" as it were). But somehow Draven stands out - first when he is hit by an arrow and it doesn't hurt him or draw blood (since, yeah, it struck a part of his shield), since this shows that he is automatically King. Next, when the High Priest calls him out, he happens to have around his neck a Free-Mason symbol, which sets off the High Priest to declare him a God (since, well, it's the same image as on a tablet or something). For all of the riches now at Draven's disposal, over a short period of time - that is, he really starts to like the idea of this God thing, when before he was on par with Peachy, a tough and smart and witty entrepreneur. No Guts, No Glory, I guess.This is the sort of story that reads interesting and raises questions about Colonialization and worship in general. On the screen, when delivered by a director who lets the backdrops of the mountains and hordes of middle-eastern mountain people, and the glorious acting of Connery (I might say at a career high here) and Caine (who is no slacker either, certainly when he realizes how crazy Draven has become), it becomes something to behold. The dialog is one thing that sticks out as particularly clever and intelligent; the script could easily fall into some kind of delirious or ridiculous swashbuckler story, or even something that praises what they're doing. But Huston and his co- writer's script give these characters smart things to say, things that people like these British officers with carte blanche, as well as their go-between guy who translates for them, would say in this unlikely cinematic situation. Like other Huston films ala 'Falcon' and 'Sierra Madre', it's very quotable.The themes are very potent, and not dumbed down or so sensational that they become incredulous. Huston and Kipling draw upon the history of man's ability to overcome obstacles, be it climbing a mountain or training a small army or becoming enamored with the responsibility of a God, what the outcome of adventure and ambition does to people. It's significant, for example, that Draven is told about how Alexander the Great picked his wife from this region when he ruled, and so he decides he must take a wife and bear a son for future rulers, even as it's spoken that women fear being chosen to become the wife of a God since they'll burn up in flames. Things like that, or how simple a small group of monks can stop an entire battle with everyone bowing in heed. It's remarkable how astute the commentary is in the film, while at the same time not detracting from the action or the power of the performances.The Man Who Would be King is elegant and harsh, with a beautiful and harrowing Maurice Jarre score (if not as iconic still as fantastic as Lawrence of Arabia for him), and memorable for its star power and how its story is really about something. It's also a grandly British story, of guys who sing traditional songs when they're bored or near death) and joke when they can and are so likable for how they just go for broke. That's one other thing: these guys are never so distasteful as to be hated, and even their 'scheme' is sort of endearing because of everything they go through to get to Kafiristan. There's a reason at the end Kipling stands mouth agape instead of reaching for his gun; in spite of everything these guys are truly, painfully human.",

            "content": "It took John Huston more than 20 years to bring one of his favorite stories, \"The Man Who Would Be King,\" to the big screen. Originally, he had Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable in mind for the lead roles. Sean Connery and Michael Caine would end up in the roles. Overall, it was worth the wait.Based on Rudyard Kipling's short story, \"The Man Who Would Be King\" is a tale set in the 1880s at the height of the British empire's rule in India. Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan (Connery and Caine respectfully) are two soldiers turned con men who decide to conquer Kafiristan, a remote section of Afghanistan. Once there, the two men plan to train the natives into an army, become rulers, and steal the country's treasure left behind by Alexander the Great. However, due to a misunderstanding, Daniel is crowned king and is seen as a possible god and descent of Alexander. Peachy wants to stick with the plan, but Daniel soon becomes consumed by his new power.In a decade that evolved around the 'New Hollywood,' Huston was one of the very few filmmakers from the Studiio-era to be able to continue his craftsmanship and turn out some fine stories. In a way, \"The Man Who Would Be King\" is a big screen epic presented on a smaller scale. Despite all the breathtaking scenery and fine set pieces, it ultimately is a character driven story about two friends staying together until the end. The performances of Connery and Caine rank among the best work from their distinguished careers. Christopher Plummer also gives a fine performance as Kipling himself. Huston, who always seemed to adapt other's materials successfully, achieved one of his most personal projects into fine perfection. With beautiful locations and a wonderful musical score by Maurice Jarre, \"The Man Who Would Be King\" is not only one of Huston's best, but is also one of the best films to come out from the 70s that still had a certain feel of stories that had a feel of a time long gone when film audiences were able to enjoy films that had everything. Adventure, comedy, drama, suspense, and so forth. I guess you could say 'They don't make them like they use to' after viewing this film from one of the great film mavericks of all time.",

You shouldn't have to miss out a movie this good just because you haven't heard of it.That said, I will concentrate more on the movie. It's based on a short story by Rudyard Kipling, but this is one of the few occurances where I find the film better. It's an amazing story set in India from when it was under British rule. As the main characters we see Sean Connery and Michael Caine, and they do great roles. I'd always known Sean Connery was a great actor, but I hadn't seen Caine's potential until I saw this movie. Their characters' friendship makes this a warming movie, but at moments it's also quite sad. Besides Connery and Caine, it has many memorable characters, like Christopher Plumming as Kipling.Stan Huston directs, and I think it shows. The environments for example, really are outstanding; the icy mountains, the crowded market and the Pakistan deserts. When I had finished watching I was overwhelmed, it felt like one of the greatest stories ever told, much like the feeling I had after watching Lawrence of Arabia and Dersu Uzala. There's really nothing that goes against this movie, and needless to say I gave it 10/10.",

There are some modifications to the original but, in this case, I actually think that they improve the story, make a little more sense, or at least are beneficial for turning the book into a film. One example that comes to mind is the decision to have Billy Fish be a lost soldier, which makes his ability to act as interpreter and his loyalty to Danny and Peachy more understandable. The makers also decided to throw in a few references to other Kipling stories and while these are unrelated, and probably meaningless to those not familiar with Kipling, Kipling fans should get a kick out of this.Kipling fans should also thoroughly enjoy how Huston and the rest successfully bring to life the wild, colourful, larger-than-life characters of Peachy and Danny, and their amazing, exciting, and appropriately tragic adventure. For those who are not Kipling fans, the fun, wonderful, yet heart-moving story that goes beyond a mere adventure into an exploration of finding one's place in the world, friendship, and death, should provide rich entertainment that is both fun and meaningful.The cast is simply wonderful. The roles of Danny and Peachy are among the greatest roles, in my opinion, that Sean Connery and Michael Caine have ever played and they do the job beautifully here. Christopher Plummer is outstanding as the cerebral, literate Kipling while Saeed Jaffrey and Doghmi Larbi, among others, also put in strong performances.The directing, costumes, settings, etc., also are excellent. The end result is a complete success that has been one of my favourite films for over 25 years. In fact, I have watched this movie well over 20 times, more than any other film.

It's an amazing, gut-wrenching journey into human soul, which contains everything one needs to know about human strengths and weaknesses. One of the reasons why this movie works so well is that it doesn't try to elude the \"dark\" side of the heroes. They are greedy, rough, sometimes selfish. But the film suggests that this \"dark\" side has no importance because they have an incredible capacity of redemption. At the end of the film, when Caine and Connery are about to be slaughtered by the monks, Connery says he's been a fool for having played with their lives and he asks Caine if he forgives him. Caine says he forgives \"totally and with no restriction\". A few seconds later, Connery falls into the precipice. Caine, whose eyes have been put out by the monks, goes down the ravine, retrieves his skull and leaves with it. Wow.In my opinion, you can't make stronger than that. This is a guy who's just been beaten to death and whose eyes have been enucleated because his friend played God and who searches his corpse to bring it back home - just because he's his friend. Man, you would have to be a rock not to be a little concerned about that.I hope all the people who took a part in the making of these 2 hours of pure magic and who are still alive are proud of their work, because they can.If you've never seen TMWWBK, do it.

            "content": "Outside of the obvious reflections on the immoral and absurdly hypocritical nature of early British colonialism, it's just a damn entertaining movie.But you have to think that Rudyard Kipling, who grew up under British rule in India, was certainly trying to shake some sensibilities when he first wrote the story as part of an 1890 package called The Man Who Would Be King and Other Stories, nearly a century before it was made into a film and during an era when the British Empire was still very much a reality.From the perceptive realization that even the staunchly important Masonic Lodge -- which had infilitrated every aspect of Britain's upper classes -- could be easily corrupted; to the arrogance as Sean Connery's character Daniel Dravot, who elevates what he sees as mere social superiority into a god-like status; to the inevitable humbling of both men at the hands of the 'savages' they profess to rule, the film is ultimately about the humility all men should exhude, particularly in the face of the unfamiliar.Kipling's tale also preached tolerance, though you might not consider that to be the case based on the film's climax:   consider that if Daniel and Peachy had shown an iota of respect for the religion that they instead decided to fleece, how differently the tale might have played out.The film owes much of its success to the chemistry between Caine and Connery, who regardless of later plaudits, gave the finest performances of their careers. Connery is particularly nuanced, with Daniel Dravot starting the tale as a somewhat lackwitted second fiddle to the scheming Peachy but later seeing his limited vision help him surpass his friend in terms of villainy with an equally heavy price. Caine plays, to some degree or another, the same charming British sheyster/teddy boy he popularized in the Harry Palmer films. But without a backdrop of similarly disaffected cockney bad guys, it's stunningly effective.John Huston's direction is among the best of his career, and in terms of his ability to use both sprawling vistas and tight, almost claustrophobic photography, owes a nod to his earlier work, including The African Queen, Night of the Iguana and the Treasure of the Sierra Madre. As examples, witness the zenith of Peachy and Daniel's hazardous trek through the mountains played out in full panoramic detail, only to be followed 90 minutes later by the tight shot of Kipling's face, the revulsion fairly etched into every crease as we reach the climax.But perhaps the true hero of this film was Boaty Boatright, who also cast Connery's classic \"The Wind and The Lion.\" He managed to take some of the most strident, forceful personalities in the film industries, threw them together and came up with a film about humility.

This is the type of film that you do not hear from many critics or many best movies list, but this is one of those films that is vastly underrated and is incredibly worthy to be considered one of the best. The story is a great adaption of Ruddy R Kipling's short story of the same name, and the main plot of the film flows fantastically throughout the spectacular cinematography, landscape, and musical score. Considering that this film is from one of Hollywood's top directors, John Hutson, you might not believe that this film has all the glory, and amazement to have the consideration to be among Hutson's other masterpieces, like the African Queen, but the film amazes with having the key elements of adventure and moral value that any great film should have. Seeing Sean Connery and Michael Caine playing two veteran British soldiers, that have become friends over the past several years is truly astonishing. These characters are not that strong on their own, but when they're together they seem like they were made for each other, and the other acting performances in the film are equally impressive, especially Christopher Plummer playing Rudyard Kipling himself. What the man who would be King does most effectively though, is that it really has a great element of moral value in it. Themes like perseverance, cleverness, loyalty, trust, and most importantly friendship, are all themes that are displayed incredibly well in this movie. This is a film for the ages, and I hope in the future that it will get more and more recognition from critics, filmmakers, and audiences alike.10 out of 10 stars, or five out of five stars A truly moving and incredible adventure for everyone to see.",

            "content": "\"I think it's one of the greatest adventure stories ever written!\" \u2013 John Huston (on Rudyard Kipling's short story, \"The Man Who Would Be King\") A glorious tall tale by director John Huston, \"The Man Who Would Be King\" stars Michael Caine and Sean Connery as Peachy and Danny, a pair of ex-British Army Sergeants. Realizing that 19th century Imperialism is not designed to benefit the lowly foot-soldiers who enact the policies and mandates of the Empire, Peachy and Danny decide to become \"private Imperialists\"; they resolve to conquer territory for their own personal gain.Huston made many films about rugged adventurers and affable scoundrels. Few of his rapscallions, though, are as much fun as Peachy and Danny who, in typical John Huston fashion, are seeking fame, fortune and adventures in exotic faraway lands. \"We're not little men,\" they say with a smirk, \"and there's nothing we're afraid of!\" Fittingly, Huston's film is structured as a \"tale within a tale\", our heroes recounting a story to Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer), the legendary writer upon whose novel the film is based. This technique allows Huston to adopt a very farcical tone: we're always aware that \"The Man Who Would be King\" is a very TALL TALE, falsified and made larger than life by both the narrator (Michael Caine) and the man who in turn narrates the narrator's narration to us (Rudyard Kipling/John Huston).The film thus unfolds like a ridiculously embellished adventure, our heroes travelling over mountains, through Afghanistan and into the desert nation of Kafiristan. Their journey is absolutely preposterous (\"Nobody's done that before!\" Kipling growls in the film), but it's only the beginning.Once in Kafiristan, Danny and Peachy defeat a local army, conquer a castle, raise a militia and proceed to conquer yet more territory. By the film's end, our duo has an entire monastery believing that Danny's an ancient god and so deserving of their riches, women and adulation.Of course, like Huston's \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", the good times eventually come crashing down. If \"King's\" first half offers camaraderie, wit, and funny banter, its second half offers madness, egomania and eventually defeat; the natives of Kafiristan figure out that our rogues are con-artists, and promptly kick their butts out of Afghanistan. But even this defeat is taken with good cheer by our two rascals. They really are an infectious bunch.All adventurers need a side kick, and so Huston provides an ex-Burkha soldier called Billy Fish (Saeed Jaffery), a funny guy who serves as the interpreter and friend of our rogues. Fish spouts a ridiculous accent \u2013 a merger of British and Indian \u2013 and is constantly spewing an array of silly one liners.It's not all fun and games, though. Though the film can be enjoyed as a bouncy adventure, it can equally be viewed as a story of two men battling convention, naysayers and nature, as a comment on colonialism, as a psychological parable about greed and ambition and as a study of religion and the role it plays in certain cultures (as well as the way the very same faith which enables heroes to move mountains can quickly and easily lead to self delusion).Like many of Kipling's works, the film also critiques White Imperialism. This was, after-all, an Empire which stretched across the planet and which would be directly and indirectly responsible for billions of deaths. In Huston's hands, Danny and Peachy thus become a metaphor for the Empire's arrogance, brashly conquering territory, promoting itself as a saviour/god, misunderstanding customs, acting racist and pitting one tribe against the next, all in an attempt to wrestle away more wealth and control. Furthermore, the fact that our heroes are exposed as frauds and chased out of Kafiristan, strongly resembles the various revolutions that rocketed across the British Empire during the decade in which Kipling's tale was written (late 1880s). ie - the Empire came, saw, conquered, and then deservedly got kicked out of town.What's remarkable, though, is how sophisticated \"The Man Who Would be King\" is compared to other similar films of the era. One must remember, the 1950s-70s were packed with films which attempted to rehabilitate the Age of Empire, and which attempted to white-wash and glorify British Imperialism (\"Khartoum\", \"Zulu\", \"King of the Khyber Rifles\", \"The Planter's Wife\", \"Safari\", \"North West Frontier\", \"East of Sudan\" etc). Countering these films were \"serious\" directors like David Lean, Satyajit Ray, and straight-faced fare like \"Gandhi\" and \"Guns at Batasi\". Huston, though, has made an anti-Imperialist adventure with the bounce of a 1930s-50s Imperialist lark. He pulls this off thanks largely to Michael Caine's performance and a subtly tongue-in-cheek script.8.9/10 \u2013 One of Huston's greatest films. See Pontecorvo's \"Burn\", Herzog's \"Wrath of God\", \"Goodbye Uncle Tom\", \"Passage to India\", \"Full Metal Jacket\" and \"The Quiet American\". Worth two viewings.",

Those submitted twenty years ago reflect the range of subjective response you might expect from any film. Move forward to those submitted in the last few years and a common theme arises. The film is \"unwatchable\" because it portrays people in a colonial era with a colonial perspective. Somehow it's assumed that the writer casting forth this judgement somehow from birth knew all that is right and just and can, without a shred of arrogance or hypocrisy, see clearly the sins of the past and guide the rest of us as to what is correct and incorrect for us to allow our weak eyes and ears to take in or avoid so that we can also live a similarly enlightened life.Someday I hope those who so arrogantly seek to cancel or at least condemn any film from an earlier era that did not by some miracle anticipate what would be politically correct in 2022 will gain some humility. Hopefully they will then finally come to recognize that they too suffer from the flawed human condition and are blind to what the next generation will someday condemn them for.If you want to see how great filmmaking was done before digital technology made it easy to create any setting, this is a great film to watch. If you want to see how people viewed the world in the colonial era - and - of you want to understand how those who lived through the Great Depression and WWII sought to portray the colonial era, this is a great film to watch. It's also a well told story if you have the ability to follow a story that doesn't unfolds slowly and doesn't flash from one action scene to another.However, if you are like those who led the cultural revolution in China and believe that history must be eradicated or revised, I guess this is one of the cultural artifacts that must be destroyed.

He (Michael Caine) and his buddy (Sean Connery) were soldiers in the British army but got badly separated from the rest of the troops. They wandered and wandered until they came upon an odd civilization that had never been exposed to the outside world. The two men's oddly colored skin and dress frightened the people and it looked like the two might be killed. However, Connery is able to convince them that he is a god and the people actually believe him! And, as a god, he is able to rule over the people and have his pick of any woman he wants. Suddenly, life is very good for the two men.However, I said that Caine was reduced to looking like a decrepit beggar. How this all came about and what happened in this magical land is just something you'll have to discover for yourself.The film has wonderful acting from the two leads, as well as terrific writing and locations. They just don't make adventure movies like this any more and that's a real shame!",

            "content": "I was surprised to read that when the film was first released some critics thought that Michael Caine infused too much humour into \"The Man Who Would be King\". However, there were others who thought the whole thing was simply a brilliant return to form by director John Huston. I'm with them. The plot, based on Rudyard Kipling's short story, has two ex-sergeants of the Indian Army, Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery) and Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine), setting off from British India in the late 19th-century to seek their fortune in Kafiristan.\"We are not little men\", Carnehan tells Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer) before setting off on their quest, and this isn't a little movie; it has size to spare. Of course these days, 50 years later, \"The Man Who Would be King\" is as politically incorrect as they come; it probably was in 1975 when Huston made it, but not so much in 1888 when Rudyard Kipling wrote the story and the British Raj still ruled.However, for those who can see it as the pure adventure it was intended to be, it is a unique experience. It has similarities with \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\". Both films feature two buddies pushing their luck outside the law, but who have each other's backs despite the occasional disagreement.As for Caine's comedy? Peachy is an irrepressible cockney who can see the irony in the worst situation; he keeps things in perspective even when Danny overreaches himself. The critics who didn't appreciate the light touch Caine brought to the film couldn't have read the Kipling story - much of the dialogue and that grandiose turn of phrase is sourced directly from there.Huston added a lot of business to the story. It's as though Kipling composed the broad notes of the symphony, but Huston added the orchestral colour.And the music? Maurice Jarre's score blends orchestral and Eastern instruments; at once mysterious, intimate and triumphant. He also incorporated the hymn \"The Son of God Goes Forth to War\" set to the tune of \"The Minstrel Boy\", which Peachy actually sings at the very end of Kipling's short story. It was another inspired touch in an inspired movie.Huston made more than his fair share of masterpieces including \"The Man Who Would be King\". He could also write, he could act, he could be a tyrant and he could be a charmer; one thing's for sure though, he was not a little man.",

I've never read the novel, but the movie is something to behold. Sean Connery and Michael Caine play a pair of men stationed in British India who decide to set up their own fiefdom in the remote Kafiristan. The movie isn't just an adventure story. It also shows the protagonists' arrogance (\"You'll learn how to fight like civilized people!\"). No surprise that things don't go quite as the men planned.It's more than a little ironic that the regions on which the movie focuses - the Afghanistan-Pakistan region - are back in the news in the 21st century. The more that things change, the more they stay the same. The protagonists should've learned a lesson from Alexander the Great's experiences in the region, as should every empire that's gone into Afghanistan.But anyway, the movie is more proof of what a great director Huston was, and what great actors Connery and Caine are (as well as Christopher Plummer, who plays Kipling).

Caine and Connery make a superb duo whilst Saeed Jaffrey is an excellent Gurkha even though he looks nothing like a Nepalese. The visuals are terrific, although it is sometimes possible to tell that this has been shot in Morocco rather than Afghanistan. The story provides an interesting look at colonialism. Caine's character wants to go in fast, make a bundle of loot and peg it for the border. At first Connery agrees but after making himself King and being mistaken for a god he grows to develop feeling of paternalism and tries to create a European style state involving religious and social reform. Predictably the natives discover that he bleeds, hence is not a god, hence is a deceiver and promptly decide to butcher him (leading to one of the best and bravest death scenes in cinema). Kipling is much excoriated these days but he was no mere jingo but a clear sighted man with no illusions about imperialism. This fable is not just an adventure but also a warning.A warning that has not been heeded by ISAF in Afghanistan. As the film tells us, in a land of mountains each valley will fight the next. Yet Connery and ISAF have tried to make a centralised state out of disparate and often hostile peoples whose terrain defies such attempts. Furthermore these are people with their own beliefs and attempts to change them are almost certainly doomed to failure. Thus Connery's abortive efforts to marry a local woman in defiance of tradition and ISAF's promotion of causes, particularly women's rights, that are not only inimical to much of the native population but which promote resentment. The British Empire learned this after the loss of her American colonies. With the conquest of her second, non-American, empire, they would learn to rule through the locals rather than over them. Connery, like ISAF, can win the battles because, spurning the indecisive raids an Afghan chief urges them to fight, they can organise men, drill them, equip them and bring them to one decisive battle. But winning the battle is only half the war, for you need a political solution to go with your military one. In the end Connery dies, Caine is mutilated and ISAF will return home, leaving a sorry state of affairs.",

I would place this film among my top 5 favorite movies of all time, and I am definitely NOT a man!This film is the epitome of everything that is good in a film.  Great locations, great direction, great art direction, great story, great plotting and most especially, great acting.Michael Caine and Sean Connery have done \"bigger\" works, but together, they have made the \"biggest\" work they could ever do.  The spirit and life in their characters--the sheer optimism that they show, even in the final scenes of the film are heart wrenching and beautiful.  They \"make\" Daniel Dravot, Esquire and Peachy Carnehan come to beautiful life, embodying all that is innocent in two men who have been to war, conquered their demons, and now desire to fulfill the rest of their dreams.The underlying subplot of freemasonry is an interesting one as well.  For it would not have been out of character for men such as Danny and Peachy to have been masons, nor for Kipling to be one as well. (Did anyone ever note that this was Christopher Plummer's first of two roles that dealt quite a lot with freemasonry? Murder by Decree, four years later, is the other)I just love this movie for itself.  I've been a fan of H. Rider Haggard, and it's the same kind of thrill you get in reading his work.  I just HATED it when they started remaking the Haggard movies and putting women like Sharon Stone in them, when it's supposed to be a \"male\" adventure.  You would certainly never find a woman like that in The Man Who Would Be King--it is the TRUE essence of a film about MEN in a MAN'S era.Michael Caine and Sean Connery are, for lack of a better word, geniuses in the art of filmmaking.  They have become true ACTORS, because they love their craft so much, and know the difference between acting and faking it. They are not out to prove themselves \"stars\" because they don't need that--they know how to ACT and that is far more important.If any filmmaker now were to tackle a project such as The Man Who Would Be King, they would likely try to cast some big name \"star\" such as Tom Cruise, and ruin the story.  Let's hope this film is NOT remade--it would certainly taint what is perhaps one of the few masterpieces of modern day story telling.",

But here the telling is more leisurely and for awhile we don't know where the story is going. First, it seems a comedy, then the more adventurous elements take over and finally it goes for a gripping climax in which all hell breaks loose when the two con men are about to get their comeuppance.\nAs the decidedly shady characters, corrupt and acting out of a simple desire for riches, SEAN CONNERY and MICHAEL CAINE give probably the most skillful performances of their careers. My only complaint about Caine is that sometimes his Cockney accent (spoken in a hushed voice at a key moment in the film) is hard to understand. Some post-production dubbing would have been advisable.For all of its sense of adventure, the film often plods along at a snail's pace between its more colorful episodes and could have been more tightly edited to tell its story in far less running time.Frankly, I enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek GUNGA DIN infinitely more than this Huston film. That's not to say the film is a failure. The cinematography is great and all of the performances are extremely well done--with special mention of CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER who is highly effective as Rudyard Kipling himself. His final scene is a memorable close-up after Caine has told him the truth about the harrowing end of their adventure.Although highly entertaining at times, it's easy to see why this story of two con men is not considered to be one of John Huston's greatest. By no means a failure, it nevertheless has enough flaws and is just uneven enough to make you realize it could have been a truly great adventure film.",

Here the mountain dwellers believe the rouge white fellows to be Gods, and thus things are about to get very interesting indeed.Written by master writer Rudyard Kipling, directed by behemoth John Huston and starring British legends Sean Connery & Michael Caine, there really isn't any way this film could have failed - sure enough the picture exudes a classy structure that is coupled with deftly smart writing. The Man Who Would Be King was a project that John Huston had coveted for many a year (decade), as far back as the 40s he was looking to adapt the Kipling short with Humphrey Bogart & Clark Gable in the leads. Some time after it was mooted that he fancied Peter O'Toole & Richard Burton to play Messrs Dravot & Carnehan. Fast forward to 1975 and the eventual pairing of Caine & Connery now looks like a masterstroke of casting, and it really is impossible to imagine anyone else in the roles of the amoral scavenger duo of the piece. in short, the wait for the film was indeed worth it.That the film is known as an adventure genre staple is a given, but it should be noted that in amongst the delightful fusion of fantasy and swashbuckling values, there lies wonderful characterisation, cheeky sly glances at the power crazy, imperialism, greed, and it pulses a political beat. A highly entertaining picture that stands up really well ever more today in this new millennium age. I mean it's got Caine & Connery playing rapscallions for Gods sake!

Connery and Caine play the two lovable rogues who attempt to seek their fortune in the mythical land of Kafiristan. Their portrayal of the two ex-British Army sergeants is masterful. Only someone who had served in the British armed forces could have achieved such an accurate characterisation of a British NCO teaching drill to raw recruits. Caine himself had served in the British Army during the Korean War, and he appeared to be reliving his army experiences with relish. We are indeed fortunate to have been spared the original partnership of Bogart and Gable, or the other, later planned partnerships of Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster, or Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Fine actors that these all are, they simply wouldn't have been able to play the roles of Peachey or Dravant with the understated humour that sustained British soldiers abroad through thick and thin. Only Newman and Redford could have come close, but their version would more likely have turned out to be \"Butch and Sundance Go to India\". Saeed Jaffrey is also magnificent and infinitely believeable. The whole film makes those with a spirit of adventure yearn for the lost days of Empire.

The Man Who Would Be King is another triumph for director John Huston on the subject of excessive greed and written destiny. The Treasure of Sierra Madre was a Classic film and it has remained an iconic film for years but despite the influencing factor The Man Who Would Be King separates itself because of adventurous and regional plot supported by historical names. Two British former soldiers decide to set themselves up as Kings in Kafiristan, a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander the Great but one of them tries to be mighty by fooling priest in the name of god. Who could ever beat destiny and so does the climax implants expected perishing stuff. The film has 3 main characters of Sean Connery, Micheal Ciane and Saeed Jaffery and all 3 of them have done great job. The beauty of the film lies in it's cinematography and locations because adventurous plot needs to be told in that way. If you can't get locations and Cinematography right then adventure will never look an adventure. Screenplay tackles all the conditions perfectly whereas dialogues are mostly in regional zone. John Huston took up the same subject but explored it in totally different manners with the help of different characters, different shades, different era and different storytelling. Anybody who liked The Treasure Of Sierra Madre with definitely like The Man who Would be King but certainly the impact won't be same, though it won't be too less. Nevertheless, getting close to it is a victory for any director and especially when the director remains same.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

After seeing it again a few weeks ago, it has not only lost non-of its appeal, but it rewards occasional, repeated viewings. I also realize that its credentials in terms of acting, script, direction, photography are impeccable, but unlike many films that the critics rave about, these are matched by its entertainment value. Connery and Caine play two ex-British army sergeants who attempt to become kings of a small, unknown Asian country, but are eventually betrayed by their own greed and convey a strong sense of vanity to human endeavor as a whole. Yet these weighty themes are perfectly treated by Huston and Hill's script that makes the audience like and admire these two men, in spite of their deep immoralities. Their relationship is comic, but is not just a case of one-liner swapping, but a believable and ultimately moving bond that is enhanced but the perfect casting of Connery and Caine. The result is one the most memorable male screen partnerships ever. Huston as director keeps things moving along at an enjoyable pace and his camera work and visuals create a beautiful and epic scope to the story.

These two scoundrels aspire to become kings in their own right in a distant land of Kafristan. Despite its downbeat ending, this ambitious saga has some amusing moments early on as the roguish pair visit the famous writer Rudyard Kipling before they march off to glory. This is an old-fashioned melodrama about a pair of mercenaries who get everything that they deserve in the long run. Nevertheless, Connery and Caine have a field day as the Queen's own until they encounter tragedy. Our protagonists masquerade as natives and enter a land where no white man has been seen since Alexander the Great in 230 B.C. They raise an army from a small ruler's kingdom and march into battle against one tyrant after another until Connery's Daniel Dravot leads a reckless charge against the enemy in their first battle against the orders of his comrade-in-arms Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine) who reprimands him for his amateurish behavior. During the charge, an arrow plunges into Daniel's chest, but lodges harmlessly in his bandoleer and he survives. However, everybody who witnessed his exploit believe that Daniel survived because he is nothing less than divine, a god, and they fall down on their knees and worship him. Predictably, our heroes amass a fortune in gold, but Daniel begins to believe in his own divinity and makes the mistake of taking a wife. When the dame bites him during their wedding ceremony, they realize that they have cooked their collective geese. Everybody realizes that Daniel isn't a god and they sent him to his death and crucify poor Peachy.

Later, Peachy and Danny, who are ex-soldiers, ask Kipling to witness a contract between them that they will venture to become kings of Kafiristan (a then mysterious province in current day Afghanistan) rather than stay in India or return to Britian. Before leaving, Kipling gives Danny his watch charm (the masonic square and compasses) for good luck. The rest of the story, is told by Peachy as he recounts the journey he and Danny took to get to Kafiristan and their subsequent attempt to become rulers of that land.The cast certainly is strong. Some of the supporting cast are unknowns, such as Karroom Ben Bouih as the High Priest (his only film role at the age of 103), or Doghmi Larbi as Ootah, and the relatively unknown Shakira Caine (Mrs. Michael Caine) as Roxanne. Saeed Jaffrey who plays Gurkha Billy Fish is relatively unknown to the United States, but has a very strong acting resume (the first Asian to receive an OBE for services to drama). This is added to by a rich stable of stand-ins who look as close to the real thing as one can get. This adds to the already powerful performances by Connery and Caine.Director John Huston certainly did a fantastic job on this film. It may not be as well known as \"The Maltese Falcon\" or \"The Treasure of Sierra Madre,\" but it delivers as powerful of a performance as either of those two films. Huston shows in this that he never lost a step as a director or a story teller (he co-wrote the screenplay).What I really enjoy about this movie is that it has quite a few masonic overtones. Kipling was a Freemason and certainly put masonic content into all his stories (in this film it is a major plot point). However, this story is enjoyable and poignant regardless of whether you are a Mason.",

Directed by venerable and acclaimed director John Huston, the film starts from a series of exotic South-Asia vistas, then bumps into a rapid hustling with Christopher Plummer as the avatar of the renowned writer himself intermingling with Sean Connery and Michael Caine's Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan, two British solider resigned from the army and going to try their luck in Kafiristan. Then the cut-back narrative slowly but thoroughly turns into a slapstick daredevils' wacky adventure into a tribal residence. The action part is awfully crass, the battle fighting and using rifles to massacre local tribes could never be shoddier, at least they could have hired a team of more professional extras or at least trained them with a little bit more commitment. Only the props and the settings opaquely convince me it is a big budget film, the mind-blowing blizzard and avalanche are something quite spectacular to watch, but all fail to be foils; The two leads Sean and Michael, both at their prime, delivered a solid bromance which could be the only non-artificial part I could recall. Colony and religion, are like guns and roses, they never mesh together well, plus the patronizing attitude alone could exasperate its audience especially foreign ones like me to consider the film is a sheer miscarriage (though it had received 4 Oscar nomination with no wins).",

A rollicking Gunga Din type of work, but given the zeitgeist of the 70s, anachronistic to the period. Defying conventional wisdom he went ahead and enlisted Sean Connery and Michael Caine and turned it into a classic that today holds up far better than many of the \"cutting edge\" works of that era.Former British Army vets, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan devise an elaborate and audacious plan to trek across Afghanistan to rule their own fiefdom. After an arduous journey they settle on Kafiristan, an area that has not seen a white man since Alexander the Great, centuries before. Deeply superstitious the locals recognize Dravot as a god after he takes an arrow to his protected chest without bleeding. Winning battles, improving the infrastructure, judging squabbles Dravot starts to become drunk with power, much to Peachy's dismay. Delusions of grandeur begin to take hold of Dravot however when the so called god announces he will take a human wife as his queen.Greatly assisted by regular DP Oswald Morris' epic feel capture this is probably John Huston's best high adventure film since Treasure of the Sierra Madre and one of his better late career works. The Man Who Would be King features the ideal pairing of Connery and Caine as the con artist vets in search of power and treasure. With Caine as the more grounded, Connery inching toward vainglorious the duo's loyalty to each other remains steadfast, never wavering even as the plan starts to unravel they display the best of buddy picture chemistry. While one can speculate what the first pairing of Gable and Bogie may have produced they would be hard pressed to match this perfect teaming. An excellently done neo-epic with staying power.",

Its written by a man who more or less accepted that truth while wondering about its human dynamics. The film is made by a man who is of the same mind as Victoria and not Kipling. There is no questioning at all in his approach: the means to a competent movie is largely a matter of having enough confidence to appear consistent.And its presented by two untrained British actors whose acting technique depends on simply bulling their way personalitywise. (Actually, Connery is a Scot, a distinction he would consider significant now.) The \"pretty girl\" here who is the undoing (after signed pledges promising no sex), is Caine's wife. She's a Latin American beauty queen that he fell in love with by seeing her on TeeVee (made beautiful by Ridley Scott, then a director of commercials).So the thing is set up by an unbroken line of bold interlopers with only Kipling having any reflective reservations about the enterprise. It actually works insofar as that matters. I mean its coherent; few large movies are. But its broken in the same way that it portrays cultural brokenness, which I suppose is to be expected.The thing I liked about this was the depth in the images. Its not depth that actually matters, but it shows intent. The business about the compromised sanctity of the Freemasons and how ridiculous it is. Engineered superstitions.The bit about \"God's own Trousers\" as the epithet of choice from a person in whose culture trousers are a sign of civilization. The stuff about heads, both literally and as leaders. Even the simple business about temporary bridges. Its high school stuff, but fun to see.

            "content": "John Huston had long cherished the ambition of making a film of Rudyard Kipling's novella \"The Man Who Would Be King\". His original plan, rather oddly, envisaged both the main roles being played by American actors, Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart, but this came to nothing when Bogart died in 1957. Later suggestions were to use approached Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, or Robert Redford and Paul Newman, but Huston was eventually persuaded to use British actors and Michael Caine and Sean Connery were cast.The film is set in the India of the 1880s. Kipling himself appears as a character and acts as narrator, relating a story he was told by an acquaintance named Peachy Carnehan, a disreputable former soldier turned gun-runner, swindler, thief, blackmailer and general all-round crook. Carnehan tells of how he and his equally disreputable comrade-in-arms Danny Dravot travelled to Kafiristan in search of adventure. (Kafiristan, the \"land of the unbelievers\" is a real place, a remote province of Afghanistan. Before the inhabitants were forcibly converted to Islam in the 1890s they practised their own polytheistic religion).There then follows a sort of picaresque yarn as Carnehan and Dravot make their way across India to Kafiristan where, after numerous adventures, Dravot is crowned king by the superstitious local people, who believe him to be the reincarnation of Alexander the Great. This, in fact, was exactly what the two men hoped to do- impress the locals with the aid of modern European weaponry, set themselves up as rulers and then cut and run, stealing enough valuables in the process to enable them to live as rich men on their return to Britain. And then things begin to go wrong. Carnehan wants to go ahead with the original plan, but Dravot wants to stay on as king of Kafiristan. Needless to say, things do not quite work out as he plans.Connery and Caine were perhaps Britain's most celebrated screen actors of their generation, but this was the only film in which they acted together. Connery's performance was much praised, but Caine's was criticised by some who felt that it was too broad and comic. I would not agree with these criticisms. Dravot and Carnehan initially seem like similar characters- dishonest chancers, living by their wits- but as the story progresses the differences between them become more apparent. There is a reason why the film is called \"The Man Who Would Be King\" and not \"The Men Who Would Be Kings\".Carnehan is a cynical rogue, although a not altogether unsympathetic one, whose only concern is with riches. Dravot is a more complex figure. He is motivated by an odd mixture of idealism and arrogance. During his brief reign he shows a well-developed, if crude, sense of justice and believes that as king he will be able to transform the impoverished backwater into a modern state. His motives, however, are not completely altruistic; one of his fantasies is that he will be invited to London to meet Queen Victoria as an equal. Because of their different personalities, the two men need to be played in different ways. Carnehan is essentially a comic figure, something signalled by Kipling in giving him the rather ridiculous forename \"Peachy\". (There is a lot of comedy in the film, particularly in the first half). Dravot is in the last resort essentially a tragic one.Although it predates by about a decade the 1980s vogue in the British film and television industries for tales of the Raj (\"A Passage to India\", \"Heat and Dust\", \"The Jewel in the Crown\", etc.), \"The Man Who Would Be King\" is one of the great cinematic epics of British India and one of the best films of the seventies. More than an adventure story, it is also a study of character and a parable about ambition and about the relationship between religion and political power. (Dravot's power over his subjects depends upon his ability to convince them that he is a god). As one critic commented, \"John Huston has been wanting to make this movie for more than 20 years. It was worth the wait.\" 9/10 Some goofs. The story is set between 1882 and 1885 when Rudyard Kipling would have been a teenager. He is played by the 45-year-old Christopher Plummer. (Plummer does, however, look remarkably like the older Kipling). We learn that Dravot is a native of Durham, but Connery plays him with his normal Scottish accent. (Geographically, Durham is not too far from Connery's native Edinburgh, but linguistically the two cities have very different accents).",

A land where no white man has set foot since Alexander The Great.Hands down Sean Connery's best movie of the 1970's. It could be the best movie he had made at this point. An argument could even be made that it's his best movie EVER. It is certainly his best performance. He is simply superb. I think the Academy were blind not to nominate him. I'm not saying he should have won, as Jack Nicholson was superb in One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest. But he should have been nominated. Connery and Caine were a good double act as the inseparable rogues, who dabbled in blackmail and gunrunning, and were the best of friends, the type of mates, whom you'd go to your death, fighting beside. Caine dominates the first hour, Connery the second. If I have any complaints, it's that Caine hams it up a little too much early on. Connery hard the harder role of the two, especially when he became to believe his own myth, first as another Alexander The Great and then thinking he was a god. He truly was growing with every movie he made outside of Bond to become a brilliant actor.Christopher Plummer was great as Kipling, and I also enjoyed Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish too.If you have not seen this, I highly recommend it.

Daniel Dravot (Sir Sean Connery) and Peachy Carnehan (Sir Michael Caine) are former soldiers who make it their mission to undergo an arduous journey to the remote land of Kafiristan (where no white man since Alexander the Great has set foot) to set themselves up as rulers. This they will do by helping the locals to defeat their enemies. But, not unpredictably, Daniel ends up taking his position rather seriously.With the equally great Christopher Plummer appearing as Kipling, this story takes hold immediately, engrossing the viewer while giving them a solid, old-fashioned Hollywood adventure. The production values are first-rate (this was largely shot in Morocco), the music by Maurice Jarre is affecting, and the teaming of Connery & Caine (good friends in real life) ensures some great chemistry in what could be seen as an earlier example of the \"buddy film\". Some real tension is derived from Connery possibly being exposed as an average flesh-and-blood mortal, and not a god as the locals start to see him. While watching, the viewer knows that this may not end well, in the tradition of any tale of a character or characters \"playing God\", but it's a journey well worth taking.Connery and Caine offer their incredible charisma and screen presence to these shameless but ingratiating characters. Offering excellent support are the briefly seen Plummer (seen mostly in the first act and then briefly at the end), Saeed Jaffrey as Daniel and Peachys' amiable countryman \"Billy Fish\", and Larbi Doghmi as the character Ootah. Caines' striking real-life wife Shakira, playing a lovely lass named Roxanne, is mostly a scenery attraction and doesn't really have to do much acting.The atmosphere is wonderful, the storytelling keeps its grip throughout, and Daniel & Peachy make such a memorable pair, from their introductory scenes to their scheming to their incredible journey across the mountainous Asian countryside.If you want to see the stars at their best, \"The Man Who Would Be King\" is the film for you.10 out of 10.",

Nah, it is offensive in such a silly way that being offended would be silly. Still, no director would dare to make such a move.And this is how refreshing it is to discover such gems four decades after they graced the screen. The scene I just described isn't even the highlight of \"The Man Who Would be King\", John Huston's glorious adventure movie, but it serves to make my point, the film is fun and politically incorrect, so old-fashioned it is actually ahead of our time. Maybe John Huston found a parcel of liberty in the 70's that could allow him to explore all the colonial clich\u00e9s for a great mix of humor and escapism, and the result is just too enjoyable and entertaining to inspire a negative reaction.And how could anyone snub a film that features the two most talented Englishmen of their generations, both associated to famous spy series (although movie lovers are more familiar with James Bond than Harry Palmer), both tall and strong guys, one blonde, one dark, and both with an instantly recognizable accent. Say what you want about Michael Caine and Sean Connery, but their chemistry is as believable and enjoyable as the way they complete each other, and have fun playing their respective roles. Peachy Carnehan (Caine) and Daniel Dravot (Connery) are two ex-Victorian soldiers, free masons, in quest for riches, hidden treasures, power and the pride from going further than the British Empire itself where the sun never set, but neither did the British foot in that remote country hidden behind the Afghan mountains: Kafiristan. Speaking Arabic and knowing that the term Kafir means pagan, it is very revealing of the place's hostility if no religion ever got there.And this is where the two men decide to go, and they take a young correspondent in India, named Rudyard Kipling (played by an unrecognizable Christopher Plummer) as a witness. They make a pact: to never drink or touch women until they conquer Kafiristan. The young Kipling warns them that no man ever went to these Godless cities after Alexander the Great, to which Peachy replies: if a Greek did it, we can. Indiana Jones was an adventurer but he was mostly driven by necessities and intellectual quests, here, you have two obvious antiheroes, driven by pride, greed, selfishness and yes so utterly convinced that they are in the right path, that we follow them with the same enthusiastic fun. And we see them venturing in these exotic lands full of beggars, snake charmers, old smoking soothsayers, crowded markets and some hints of the British civilization, but there's always more to see. That's the motto of adventurers and that's the curse of Hustonian heroes.I mentioned Indiana Jones but indeed, \"The Man Who Would be King\" is such a brazenly entertaining and nicely nasty film that it would make you wonder why is it that \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is perceived as the one that resurrected the adventure genre. We have heart-pounding fight sequences, exotic locations that go from snowy mountains, road-stopping glaciers, from rocky deserts to inhabited oasis waiting for the civilization to \"bring order\". It has larger-than-life characters and meek, funny sidekicks like Saeed Jaffrey. The humor is sometimes racist and colonialist but it is done in such a free-spirited and comical way that it is obvious the joke is on the leads and this is typical of John Huston's movies, to distract us from the heroes' flaw by confronting them to worse people. And the two con-men are put in a place where a series of misunderstandings will allow them to be seen as Gods or kings, and just when you think you've seen all, the movie provides a completely new story in Kafiristan.And this is where lies my only \"problem\" with the film, if problem is the word, I am Moroccan, so I can't be fooled by the shooting locations, the locals look nothing Indian or Afghans but pure Moroccan natives, but it's in the language that my suspension of disbelief was challenged, the people don't speak in Arabic but in Moroccan dialect, so I was pleasantly surprised to realize I could understand the people of Kafiristan. This doesn't really ruin the enjoyment and I appreciate the underrated performance of Moroccan then-star Larbi Doghmi (he'd also have a small but memorable role in \"The Black Stallion\") as Ootah, he manages to steal the show, and when you have Caine and Connery, that means a lot. The population also does justice to the film, I didn't spot any smiling extras and some old men were into the role, so the whole thing works overall. But it was a little bit distracting.Huston wanted this project to star Bogart and Gable, but Bogart died, then it was Gable with Caine and Gable died, but this film couldn't have had a better pairing, the two Englishmen have a sort of Pythonesque detachment while still being into their characters, and somewhat this film is like a strange and bizarre masterpiece, so anachronistic that it manages to be beyond its temporality. It feels like an older film but the cynical tone is more modern than you'd think, and even the titles, gives away one of Huston's most cherished characters: people who lose, but never without trying, these cocky bastards are full of themselves, but what a price to pay for failure rather than a life of writing behind the desk.There's a discussion near a glacier where the two men prepare for their death and wonder whether they'd trade their lives for another, the answer is obvious and the laughs that follow are irresistible. This is a quintessential Hustonian moment.",

John Huston was no stranger to stories which explored the darker aspects of the human psyche, and borrowed Kipling's short-story to weave a tale about greed, arrogance and above all friendship.Michael Caine and Sean Connery, during the best period of their careers, play two former British soldiers who make their living as con-men throughout Her Majesty's mighty empire, hatching daring plans and getting out of scraps with panache. One day they decide to travel and conquer Kafiristan, a land visited only by Alexander the Great. Their plan is bold: to cross the mountains, survive the winters and the raiders; defeat the local tribes with modern weaponry and then unite all tribes under a single nation.It all looks pretty sound until Daniel (Connery in one of his best performances) starts believing the local legends that me may be Alxander the Great's son; power goes to his head and, like in a Greek play, he brings about his own demise.The movie is equally funny, adventurous, sad and epic. There's never a dull moment in it, thanks to the great script full of amusing dialogues and thanks to the great performances by Caine and Connery. Endlessly watchable and unforgettable, The Man Who Would Be King is the movie anyone should watch when their looking for a way to have a good time.",

On a thoroughly unpredictable adventure, the duo constantly converts lemon to lemonade as they meander from a publisher's office in India to a fictional holy land in the desert. There, intending to conquer a few villages and live the high life, the stakes suddenly spike as they find themselves anointed saviors, kings and (eventually) gods. Connery and Caine, good friends away from the screen, bubble with chemistry throughout. Their relationship is essential, and that obvious bond lifts an already-ambitious screenplay into something greater than the sum of its parts. When viewed with contemporary eyes, the pace is a little slow, akin to similar films of the era, but that deliberate tempo reaps unique rewards. By lingering in the atmosphere and dutifully setting the stage, director John Huston expertly depicts the vast cultural differences between our conniving, almost-modern Brits and the ancient ways of life still at play in turn-of-the-century Asia. A fine example of old-style filmmaking, loaded with snappy humor, surprising plot turns, high stakes and creeping peril.",

The glimpse it provides into this time period feels fine-tuned in its authenticity and the cinametography is excellent. Caine and Connery star as Peachy and Danny, two soldiers who are enjoying imperialism too much to leave it. One asked by a fellow Brit why they haven't gone home, Peachy responds \"Home to what? A porters uniform outside a restaurant and six penny tips from belching civilians for closing cab doors on their blowzy women?\"\n     The two good friends decide that just for the hell of it, they'll conquer Kazakhstan, a remote kingdom on the other side of the Himalayans. Danny and Peachy are two brilliant creations, obviously because of what the actors bring to them, but also because they are the perfect embodiment for Eurocentric foolishness. They are guided by the modern-day equivalent of the Spanish Conquistadores' 3 Gs: gold, god, and glory.      So the ambitious pair trek across the mountains heavily confident that even though they'll be heavily outnumbered, they'll be able to unite everyone and be kings. The two find themselves overconfident and underqualified when they arrive, but for a short while, very lucky. After an arrow shot into Danny's (Connery) heart gets stopped by his armor, the primitive tribes start seeing him as a God, and things become very interesting for the pair.      Because most of the film is presented as a flashback, we know from the beginning of the film that at some point things went awry, because only one of the friends made it back alive. I won't tell you exactly what went wrong, but it has a little to do with their Euro-Imperialistic mindset I mentioned earlier. However, at the end of the film I was glad that one of the two friends made it back so that we could've heard such a beautiful story about friendship, ambition and ultimately, greed.",

Traveling across the treacherous, snowy mountainous terrain of Afghanistan, they enter the country of Kafiristan. There, they ply their trade as experienced British soldiers and slowly work their way to the riches of Alexander. All goes well, until they are discovered not to be Alexander's children and must now face the wrath of the local peoples. The movie is impressive with wondrous scenes and exciting action scenes.

The story was written in the 1800s, and the film was made in 1975. The area probably was not well known in 1975, but soon became better known in 1979 when the Russians invaded. In 2001, the Americans also invaded the area... and as the film says, no one has held it since Alexander the Great.So, the film's appeal for me is the tie to modern history and current events, though the factuality of the story is quite questionable.",

(It is worth noting that all the above were based on novels or short stories; few if any succeeded in translating literature to film with the skill Huston had.)The two greatest parables of the downfall of colonialism are \"Heart of Darkness,\" by Joseph Conrad, and \"The Man Who Would Be King,\" by Rudyard Kipling. Kipling, of course, championed the British Empire right and left; I wonder, then, if he quite knew how deep he had plumbed with the cautionary fable he created. Huston catches the subtext instinctively, and produces a true gem. Without sacrificing Kipling's facility with language or his sense of high adventure, Huston nails the bloody arrogance of the colonial mind, and nails it DOWN. If we begin by laughing with Dravot and Carnehan at the simplicity of the \"savages\" they seek to rule, we end in shuddering awe of the depth of what we have stumbled onto; the truth of a life and belief that can blow our greedy, venal ambitions away like dust.Connery and Caine go over like fish and chips-- they've never been better as individuals and they score mightily as a team. (And they have the perfect voices for Kipling's cadences-- you could listen to them all day.) Great kudos to the wonderful Saeed Jaffrey, Christopher Plummer, and Doghmi Larbi, whose funny, sad Ootah just about steals the movie. The music brings tears to my eyes whenever I hear it. The movie is just improbable enough to be great adventure and just poetic enough to be more. With this movie it's unbearably tempting to give a little spoiler, so (SKIP THE REST) --***************SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD******************I can't help it. Because the final shot is so wonderful; it is the reason, in fact, that I have watched this film so many times and been in awe of it each time:The fable ends as fables must, with a moral, and this simple, eloquent final shot perfectly echoes Shakespeare:\"...for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of the king keeps Death his court, and there the antic sits, scoffing at his state, grinning at his pomp, allowing him a breath, a little scene, to monarchize, be feared, and kill with looks; infusing him with self and vain conceit, as if this flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable; and, humoured thus, comes at the last, and with a little pin, bores through the castle wall, and farewell King.\"Let us paint an inch thick, to this end we will come.",

            "content": "From director John Huston (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen), I was told that this was a fantastic film, and I was certainly attracted by the two leading British actors, based on the book by Rudyard Kipling. Basically, in 1885, in India, the journalist Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer) is approached by a ragged, derelict man in his office. The seemingly crazed man reveals himself to be Peachy Carnehan (Sir Michael Caine), an old acquaintance, and tells the story of his adventures with his comrade-in-arms Danny Dravot (Sir Sean Connery). Three years earlier, Dravot and Carnehan met Kipling on a train. Carnehan stole Kipling's pocket watch, but realised that he had robbed a fellow Freemason, and had to return it. At the time, he and Dravot were planning to blackmail a local rajah, which Kipling foiled, but Carnehan stops them from being deported by blackmailing the British district commissioner (Jack May) who intervened in their plot. Frustrated with the lack of opportunities for lucrative criminal mischief in a more more civilised and regulated India, and with little to look forward to in England, the two turn up at Kipling's office with an audacious plan. They will head with rifles and ammunition to Kafiristan, a country virtually unknown to Europeans since its conquest by Alexander the Great. There they will offer their services to a ruler, help him to conquer his neighbours, but then overthrow him and steal his riches. Kipling tries to dissuade them, but lets them go, giving Dravot his golden tag as a token. Dravot and Carnehan set off an epic journey north beyond the Khyber Pass, travelling through Afghanistan, fighting off bandits, blizzards, and avalanches. Eventually, they find the unknown land of Kafiristan and chance upon Gurkha soldier, Billy Fish (Saeed Jaffrey), the sole survivor of a British expedition some years ago. Billy, speaking English, becomes their translator and smooths their way into the village. To begin their rise, they train a force of men in modern weapons and tactics, to fight against some hated neighbours. They are enticed by the people to accepting gifts, including alcohol and women, but they cannot accept, having pledged mutual loyalty and sworn not to take these temptations. During the battle, an arrow pierces Dravot's jacket but he is unharmed. The two sides are fooled into believing Dravot to be a god. Victory follows victory, with the defeated added to the ranks of the swelling army. There is a point when the people may turn against Dravot and Carnehan, and the high priest in the holy city of Sikandergul wants to determine whether Dravot is a man or a god by seeing whether or not he bleeds. When his shirt is torn open, they are amazed to see the golden tag, given by Kipling, around his neck. It contains the sacred symbol left by Sikander (their name for Alexander the Great), who had promised to send a son to rule over them. Hailing Dravot as king as well as god, the people give him a golden crown, and show him the royal treasury, full of unimaginable amounts of gold and jewels to do with whatever he wants. Carnehan suggests that they leave with as much loot as they can carry when the snow melts. But Dravot enjoys the adulation of the locals and feels a need to settle their disputes and issuing laws. He is also struck by the beauty of a girl called Roxana (Shakira Caine, Michael's real-life wife), the name of Alexander's wife, and cancels his pact to avoid women, saying he will marry her. During the ceremony, which Carnehan agrees to attend, Roxanne is reluctantly brought to him. Dravot tries to kiss her, but she is terrified of being touched by a god, and may die being mortal, so she bites his face. The people are shocked to see him bleeding and realise he is only human and try to grab the English impostors. Outnumbered in the ensuing battle and captured, Dravot is made to walk onto a rope bridge, where he sings the hymn \"The Son of God Goes Forth to War\". The ropes of the bridge are cut, he falls thousands of feet to his death. Carnehan is crucified between two pine trees but released after being found still alive the next morning. Carnehan was crippled and unhinged by this ordeal and made his way back to Indian as a beggar. Finishing his story, he leaves Kipling's office after putting Dravot's severed head, still wearing a golden crown, on his desk. Also starring Dohmi Larbi as Ootah. Connery as the man mistaken as a god and Caine as his reliable sidekick both play terrific and likeable characters, you really enjoy seeing how they can keep up the pretence as they seek their fortunes, with a sweeping score by Golden Globe nominated Maurice Jarre, a must see period adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted from Other Material, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design.

Firstly, it's the sense of adventure and discovering unknown lands along with the two leading adventurers. The madness and chaos of Indian markets leading to vast, unforgiving and exotic regions of northern Afghanistan and eventually Kafiristan was almost a documentary at times. The director's ability to capture the essence and atmosphere with each scene was a joy to watch.Secondly, this was probably the best performances from Connery and Caine I've seen. They fit their roles like a glove. The chemistry and genuine sense of inseparable friendship was evident throughout. The light hearted manner in which they approach their goal of trying to conquer a mysterious, far away land by themselves makes it a far more fun film to watch. They don't take themselves too seriously yet their razor sharp humour and intelligence caries them throughout.The two friends may have prepared themselves for all challenges along the way and overcome everything with humour and quick thinking. But can they prepare themselves for the eerie paganism of their destination and their own reaction to the huge responsibilities?

Sean Connery and Michael Caine are perfectly cast as the gruff, fearless Daniel Dravot and the sneaky and thoughtful Peachy Carnehan, respectively. These are two of the finest actors based on their own credentials, but here they put all that aside and give us two characters that have been through a lot together and are willing to put it on the line in order to find their dream: head for the mountains of Kafiristan and make themselves kings of the country.As the adventure starts out, we see the two friends meeting up with the famous British writer Rudyard Kipling (Christoper Plummer) who seems to have some important words for these two. They set out and face many obstacles and when they arrive they put their plan into action. I could go on as to what they do or what the outcome is, but that would spoil the outright fun of this wonderful tale of high-risk, action and adventure. As mentioned before, Connery and Caine are perfect in each of their roles, balancing each other and giving us a clear portrait of the British mindset at the height of their power. Huston directs with bold and outrageous shots of mountains, crowded marketplaces and vast kingdoms. In many ways, this reminded me of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, perhaps Huston's masterpiece. Just like that tale of greed for gold in the mountains of Mexico, this is a cautionary tale of greed in the mountains of Afghanistan. I encourage anyone interested to see this film; as unappreciated as it is it is just as enjoyable.",

            "content": "This film is high on my list of \"Movies I Was Looking Forward To, But Found Disappointing.\" The first half-hour, focusing on Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling, feels like something to be endured. The second half-hour, the trek of Daniel and Peachy, reaches for an epic feeling, gets close, but lacks depth, lacks any sense of spiritual struggle by these men to get to their destination. (It's possible that this lack of spiritual struggle is a deliberate choice by the writers, i.e., the two men struggle physically but not spiritually, they do not grow, and this is the core reason for their later problems. Still, the trek needs more juicy danger and less fake snow.) Sean Connery, whose work I generally like, seems not well-suited to the broad, blarney-filled character of Daniel. He's trying too hard. He's far better at relaxed elegance. Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish is one-dimensional; the actor is talented but the role is pinched and thus is irritating at times. That said, Jaffrey's last moment is absolutely superb.Michael Caine is perfect as Peachy - exactly the right tone. The film's physical settings are mostly uninspired. The terrain, when they finally arrive at their destination, is ordinary, even a bit dry and dull, when we want gorgeous.The room full of treasure exemplifies for me one of the film's problems. The room has no magic to it whatsoever, it's just a pedestrian room full of not-very-gleaming gold, and un-cut big rubies that don't say \"big rubies\" so much as they say \"boring rocks.\" Huston decides with this treasure room to emphasize stark historical realism, to make us aware of the fact that rubies were probably not cut to gleaming perfection in the day of Alexander the Great. Huston thus abjures magic and fantasy. This is a mistake. We want magic and fantasy. They are fundamental to how we think of history, deep-down. Huston's basic problem, which he never resolves, is, how do I treat history? What is my conception of the past? Do I want to make a fun historical fantasy or do I want to make something real, something with the gritty, stark feeling of historical reality to it, as in my earlier project \"The Red Badge of Courage\"? Or....can I perform a miracle and stitch together the two genres?\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" six years after \"The Man Who Would Be King,\" achieves the miracle that Huston probably thought he could achieve. \"Raiders\" recognizes that if a history film receives a light seasoning of magic, if the director makes a significant-but-not-heavy-handed commitment to glittering fantasy, the project can click nicely, can bring to the surface our unconscious fantasies about the past - that it's a place of magic and mystery. (I'm not saying the past is actually magical. I'm saying that's how we feel about it, deep-down.) Connery's last shot is good. The crowd scenes are consistently good, especially one shot where Huston, years before CGI, seems to have a couple of thousand people, actual humans, trudging along, forming an army.",

            "content": "Hugely enjoyable epic based on Kipling's cautionary adventure tale in the only film to co-star probably Britain's two biggest stars of the 60's and 70's. Adapted and stirringly directed by the then veteran maverick director John Huston, this rags to riches to rags saga seems to anachronistically belong to a different era of film-making some ten or twenty years earlier.Not that you'd confuse it with a David Lean marathon, there's plenty of action within the detail and even if the unsavoury whiff of colonialist superiority taints somewhat the initial perception of our two heroes as hapless adventurers, by the end we're won over by their honourable and regret-free acceptance of their fate even if it means the fatal demise of Connery's Danny Dravot character and the reduction to penury of Caine's Peachy Carnehan character. A cautionary tale it may be about pride coming before a fall and the risk men take in setting themselves up as gods, but the film is more about the friendship which endures between Connery and Caine, not forgetting their devoted \"batman\" Billy Fish, enjoyably brought to life by Saeeed Jaffrey.In the days before CGI & SFX, Huston does a fine job with the cinematography, particularly on location, as well as marshaling his large cast around the convincing sets. I'm fine too with the utilisation of writer Kipling as a character, introduced no doubt to frame the story as well as pointing up veracity and reminding us of its origins, with Christopher Plummer a convincing look-a-like. Caine and Connery reflect their own real-life friendship with mutually deferential performances, neither hogging the lime-light and staying true to character throughout, although as ever Sean's \"English\" accent never moves south of Edinburgh! I've read somewhere that some critics believe the movie could have worked even better if they'd switched roles but I don't see this at all, Connery's character has a naturally lofty demeanour, leading to his god-like aspirations, while Caine's is that of the down-to-earth conscience and confidant, both just as they should be. I also liked the minor irony in Caine's new wife at the time (they're still together, even now) spurning Connery's advances and thus, in fact precipitating the Englishmen's fall from grace.This then was a film I've long anticipated watching and was delighted that it didn't let me down. No sex, little violence, a fine old-fashioned story well told, just the way they used to make them...",

            "content": "Having heard my father rave about this movie, I decided to give it a try. The story concerns three main characters, Rudyard Kipling, the author of the tale, and two ex British army sergeants who, with a bit of help from Kipling, set out for the adventure of a lifetime. At first, Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine) and Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery) are played as somewhat unlikeable people, con men, blackmailers, thieves, but before long, you fall right under their spell as does Kipling, whose even been robbed by Peachy! The two military men devise a plan, witnessed by Kipling, to head to the nether regions of Afghanistan (Kifiristan I believe) and proceed to vanquish all the foes of the king there, depose him and \"Loot the place four ways from Sunday\" as Dravot puts it. I won't reveal too much, but suffice to say, this movie has many meanings and themes. Loyalty, friendship, humility, and sacrifice are chief among them. A real adventure story, with a decidedly human element. The two leads are superb, and they have the chemistry of two men that really HAVE been through the wars. Christopher Plummer really inherits Kipling, as he gets caught up in the magic, and charisma of Peachy and Daniel. A special movie, that everyone will enjoy. Highly Recommended",

            "content": "Considering that John Huston wanted to film this Rudyard-Kipling-yarn in the 50\u00b4s starring Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable, one can only sigh in relief that this plan never materialized. Because when John Huston finally was able to make the movie the result was the most engaging, the most adventurous, the most suspensefull, the best looking, the most intriguing plotted and the best cast screen-adventure of all time (it\u00b4s only possible rival being David Lean\u00b4s \"Lawrence of Arabia\"). Everything starts and ends with the casting of Michael Caine and Sean Connery as the two treasure-hunters who happen to stumble over Alexander the Great\u00b4s long lost city of Gold, where Connery is thought of as a God, starts acting wise and respectful and becomes alienated from his pal Caine - until in the end they are united again. There is a lot of talk around about John Ford\u00b4s theme of glory in defeat. In the last sequences of \"The Man Who Would Be King\" you can actually see what this means at an highly emotional level. Caine and Connery are so good together that one tends to assume they\u00b4ve made a lot of films side by side. This is tragically wrong. \"The Man Who Would Be King\" is in fact the only one; not considering Richard Attenborough\u00b4s all-star-extravaganza \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977)where they are not to be seen on the screen together. To praise the two stars doesn\u00b4t mean to underestimate the achievement of the then veteran director. Any sequence of the film shows that this was not an easy shoot and Huston being 68 at the time of shooting didn\u00b4t spare his stars, his team and least of all himself anything. The result being that \"The Man Who Would Be King\", for all its air of adventure, its sense of mythical wonders, its eyeblinking exaggerations, hits the viewer with a strong feeling of honesty. This is the finest hour for anyone involved!",

First, the whole opening market sequence, then the dance and lu-lu-lu of \"Kafiri\" women, and later the Bashkai elders' talk which is clearly Arabic.

No one in their right mind, or even in their wrong mind, would have had anything to to do with these obvious phonies. There is such a thing as literary license, but literary license has its limits too which this movie blatantly ignores. And what's even worse is the movie's ridiculously shabby portrayal of Freemasonry, a treatment that is entirely unwarranted and which undeservedly casts Freemasonry in a negative light.

The balance of the film - the first hour and a bit - is nowhere near as solid as this end section. The tone is uneven, Caine's slipping accent is very noticeable and it feels totally implausible. The characters' motivations are also hard to decipher in the first half of the film, and at times it is just plain difficult to understand what exactly is happening. Still, there is a good general feel for Indian and other cultures, thanks in part to great costumes and sets. The overall picture is the best thing for one to judge, and overall there are many good aspects about this production.

To be honest the movie wasn't quite what I expected it to be, but it sure was a great movie. The movie tells about two men, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan, who decide to resign from the Army and travel to Kafiristan to become kings. No white man has set foot in Kafiristan since Alexander, but as ambitious as Daniel and Peachy are they decide to give it a go and leave on the adventure.Being a story by Rudyard Kipling it has all the right ingredients what an adventure movie requires. The film wisely uses those ingredients, but after I had seen the movie I honestly thought it could have been better. The film just has this certain style of telling the story, which can sometimes be a bit long-winded. It does seem that sometimes there isn't that much happening and it may be unbearable for some viewers. Well it is a movie from the 70's and movies were different even back then, though it isn't a long time ago at all. Despite that it's still a great adventure movie throughout and when it's directed by John Huston (who has also written the screenplay with Gladys Hill) it is indeed guaranteed quality. The cinematography's used how it's supposed to, when shooting in exotic locations you must shoot the beautiful landscapes as well to give the viewer that certain feeling of a real adventure. We see all kinds of astonishing sceneries throughout the movie and overall the movie is shot incredibly well by using every resource the milieu has to offer.What makes this movie so great, despite the already mentioned and complimented story, directing and cinematography, is undeniably the chemistry between Sean Connery and Michael Caine. If the movie doesn't interest you at all, try at least for god sakes watch it for Connery and Caine. There's just this unspeakable chemistry which can not be described with words, undeniably one of the best I've ever seen in a motion picture. Both, Connery and Caine, have this certain charisma which can only be accomplished by just a few actors. And by putting all that charisma together, uniting it, you see a charisma which is more than you expect it to be. Sean Connery as Daniel Dravot performs the role flawlessly and same goes with Michael Caine who plays Peachy Carnehan. Just perfect. There is also a clever dialog between Dravot and Carnehan, which is a real treat for the fans. And when there's written this familiar witty sarcasm throughout the screenplay there honestly couldn't be better lead actors doing it, Connery and Caine exceed it.\"The Man Who Would Be King\" is more than just an adventure movie. It also tells a story about a true friendship, how friends should help each other in tight situations and what a real friendship is all about. This evolves the movie into a beautiful story which also makes it surprisingly dramatic. Backed up by the fantastic music by Maurice Jarre it really makes you shed a tear, even tears. Despite the movie having an opportunity to be something much better it still hangs on to be a great movie by having such magnificent lead actors in it. When each other area works really well too the movie is much better than the ingredients given to it. Sean Connery and Michael Caine can't become kings, as they already are kings. If not actual kings, then at least kings in our hearts. My heart says they are.",

Huston did not change the dramatic viewpoint, and he includes ample touches of comedy. Though the movie is a grand lark, a gripping adventure, and a rollicking good yarn, at the end we feel both emotionally drained and wiser than we were.

Two powerhouse performances to create a friendship that leaps from the screen and reminds you of the people in your life you are closest to.

            "content": "In his greatest performance outside playing James Bond and even out doing his Oscar winning role in \"The Untouchables\", Sean Connery is a sensation as the British officer who ends up in a part of the mountainous region of India where no white man has been since Alexander the Great, and in a sense, becomes him. Or so he thinks. He thinks he is the embodiment of the famous Greek conqueror and for a brief time rules that people who need some sort of leadership, but as madness takes over, his destruction awaits. Standing by his side throughout all of this is his fellow officer Michael Caine, putting up with his Madness and eventually living to tell about it to none other than famous writer Rudyard Kipling, played in a brief cameo by Christopher Plummer.If there ever was an example of cinematic motion Pictures at their best meant to be seen on a big theatrical screen, it is this. It is also one of John Huston's very best films, and he has made many classics. Saeed Jaffrey is very funny as the native Indian who becomes the liaspn between mad King Connery and the other native-born people, basically kissing up to him and guessing the indication that he's not 100% on Connery's side. Connery starts off the film just slightly nutso, but as his desire for power grows, his madness turns to insanity, and his performance just gets all the more riveting. Caine gets his moments in the spotlight, but his assignment has him trying to keep some sanity so he won't become a target once the awe over Connery's supposed God-like persona are exposed as phony.It's ironic where they are located looks a lot like the top of Mount Olympus, and when Connery put on the crown, it's as if he's Zeus in human form being possessed by the spirit of Emperor Alexander. The musical score by Maurice Jarre, the gorgeous photography and production design and the witty script are other pluses of this 70's classic that is filled with a ton of irony, something Huston specialized in. 1975 was a pretty weak year in American Cinema history, so when a film like this pops up and ends up being one of the best films of the 70's, it's pretty surprising that this didn't get the award recognition that it deserves. The film, direction and Connery certainly are among the best that 1975 had to offer, certainly in my top 10 of those categories among the best.",

            "content": "I originally thought that this was a movie about Jesus, but it turned out that it was based on a Rudyard Kipling novel, which is just as good. Kipling is well known as the author of The Jungle Story (which I have not read) but he wrote many other books, this being one of them. Kipling grew up in India, where most of his books are based, and worked there as a journalist. Kipling appears at the beginning and the end of this movie, which brings some legitimacy to the story.The story is about two British Army sergeants who decide to cross the Hindu Kush and conquer Afghanistan. They meet up with Kipling at the beginning and their interaction with him demonstrate them as being quite sly and underhanded. This underhandedness is what they take over the mountains in Afghanistan however there is a lot of luck involved as well. Firstly they are saved in the Hindu Kush by an avalanche that enables them to continue on their journey. When they arrive at the first city they meet up with an Indian guide who is able to act as a translator, and when they are taken to the holy city, the priest finds a symbol on one of them that corresponds to a symbol carved on one of their stones.However, it is very clear that this movie is going to end badly for both of them. When one of them survives an arrow shot (namely because it hits a leather strap) they believe that he is a god and worship him as such. However, there is a catch. It quickly becomes clear that while he is a god (the son of Secunda, the name of Alexander the Great, who promised that his son will return to rule them) there are limits to his power, and the priesthood make this clear. Everything comes undone when he decides that he wants to marry one of the locals (a girl named Roxanne, after Alexander's love interest). Despite all of his rhetoric he is unable to convince the natives that it is his right to marry, and when Roxanne bites him, it becomes clear that he is not a god, and is thus executed. His companion manages to escape, and this is how the tale is returned to Kipling.I guess this story is a tragedy of those who go to seek power and in finding it, are encompassed by it. To us westerner's a king is a mortal (and was so when the book was written in the late 19th Century), but to the natives, he was a god. There is no playing god, especially around non-European cultures. Captain Cook found that out the hard way when he returned to Tahiti only to be killed by the people that originally worshiped him. The same happened here when he decided that he would overturn the natives' tradition and attempt to marry. It wasn't going to happen, and no amount of rhetoric is going to change that. As the bible says, 'what does it profit a man to gain the whole world only to lose his soul'.",

On a thoroughly unpredictable adventure, the duo constantly converts lemon to lemonade as they meander from a publisher's office in India to a fictional holy land in the desert. There, intending to conquer a few villages and live the high life, the stakes suddenly spike as they find themselves anointed saviors, kings and (eventually) gods. Connery and Caine, good friends away from the screen, bubble with chemistry throughout. Their relationship is essential, and that obvious bond lifts an already-ambitious screenplay into something greater than the sum of its parts. When viewed with contemporary eyes, the pace is a little slow, akin to similar films of the era, but that deliberate tempo reaps unique rewards. By lingering in the atmosphere and dutifully setting the stage, director John Huston expertly depicts the vast cultural differences between our conniving, almost-modern Brits and the ancient ways of life still at play in turn-of-the-century Asia. A fine example of old-style filmmaking, loaded with snappy humor, surprising plot turns, high stakes and creeping peril.",

Having not seen it in years I decided to give that another go. Truth be told, it's been about six weeks since I actually watched the film, as I write this review - and it hasn't left that much of an impression, but we'll soldier on (pun intended).Two former soldiers in the British Army, Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery) and Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine) make their way across the outer reaches of the British Empire, with a plan to train a warlord to defeat his enemies, then to overthrow him and loot the country. In an encounter with a neighbouring tribe, Dravot is shot with an arrow, but protected by his uniform. This act, together with a masonic symbol that Dravot wears around his neck has both tribes convinced that he is not just a king, but also a god. An idea that goes to Dravot's head particularly quickly.Originally written by Rudyard Kipling, it's hard not to see \"The Man Who Would be King\" as a parable about the actions of the British Empire at large, pick a patsy, make them king but subservient to The Queen, tax them to death, it was a common strategy.The film, if I'm honest, struggled to hold my attention. It's hard not to be impressed by the chemistry of Michael Caine and Sean Connery, at the height of their powers, performing as they do - but I feel it's not in service of very much (on top of that, I'd consider them charismatic film stars, rather than either of them actually acting very much). I found the film to be a over long, and sluggish in the middle.To each his own, but I do feel that there's more films deserving of classic status than this.",

The biggest flaw is that it's predictable, once the two main characters make it to India, everything from their can be told twenty minutes in advance, we knew what would end up happening to each character, there isn't any unexpected twist that takes the audience away, and it's predictability is the reason why I'm giving this an eight instead of a nine that it easily could have received.

            "content": "The epic is one of several old-time genres to have all but died out in the new wave era of 1970s Hollywood. The Man who would Be King, a pet project of writer-producer-director John Huston, works by virtue of its having had a long gestation period, and its coming to fruition under the savvy guidance of Huston. It is an adventure epic in the style of a bygone era of filmmaking, but it has enough modern overlay to its adaptation to prevent it from appearing an anachronism.One of the big advantages of its being produced in the 70s and not a preceding decade is securing of the right cast. Originally the leads were to have been Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable. Another time Paul Newman and Robert Redford were posited. While all these choices were great actors and would have no doubt been fun to watch, I can't imagine any more suitable duo than Michael Caine and Sean Connery. Caine in particular is adept at making the half-poetic, half-colloquial dialogue of Rudyard Kipling's original story sound, well, just that \u2013 poetic and colloquial, and very natural when it could easily have sounded bizarre. Caine also has the earnestness of a good storyteller, so makes an ideal narrator. Connery shows comedic touches totally at odds with his usual screen persona, with some great moments like his put-look expression when Christopher Plummer declines to see him foam at the mouth. But later Connery demonstrates the presence and charisma that made him James Bond. Saeed Jaffrey is perfectly cast as their Ghurka companion, and again he is an actor the like of whom we would not have got in a 1950s production. Jaffrey creates a very likable and mischievous caricature, showing some superb and gleeful comic delivery.Huston himself was a director with a long track record, having made his directorial debut in 1941, and writing screenplays as far back as the early 30s. However he had proved himself endlessly versatile and always able to remain fresh with the times. The Man who would Be King features a few nods to such de rigeur techniques as the zoom and hand-held camera, but these are used sensibly and not with the showy abandon of the many young sprouts that were grabbing cameras and calling themselves directors around this time. And Huston still has all his original expertise intact, unlike some of the older directors around who had begun to lose their touch. One of Huston's best assets was his ability to juggle multiple actors in the frame using depth (a large part of the contrack-signing scene is done in one take), avoiding the need to edit back and forth between characters in the shot, and giving more impact to the more functional or stylised cuts such as the attention-grabbing insert of Kipling's Masonic watch chain or the powerful montage of mountains.Another aspect of The Man who would Be King in relation to its being a 70s production is its reflection of the changing political climate. It was only by this point that having Asian people played by Asian actors became the norm, as oppose to the poorer blackface copies we would have likely got had this been produced in the 50s. Bear in mind too that practically every movie in the 70s had some kind of political agenda, and the left-leaning Huston here draws attention to the anti-colonialist interpretation of the story, for example in the marketplace montage which precedes the opening credits, which relates not at all to the plot, but seems designed to emphasise the power and durability of culture on the subcontinent. These things add to the richness of the picture, without once being overbearing enough to detract from its innocent adventuresome roots.",

At the same time he stated that Kipling was a racist and an imperialist. That is an opinion held by many intellectually challenged and stunted people, who have otherwise not read or understood his works. Conversely, T.S.Eliot wrote in 1941 \"I cannot find any justification for the charge that Kipling held a doctrine of race superiority.\" Eliot found instead, \"An immense gift for using words, an amazing curiosity and power of observation with his mind and with all his senses, the mask of the entertainer, and beyond that a queer gift of second sight, of transmitting messages from elsewhere, a gift so disconcerting, when we are made aware of it, that thenceforth we are never sure when it is not present: All this makes Kipling a writer impossible wholly to understand and quite impossible to belittle.\" That is shown in this film. Another author who considered Kipling to be a great and incomparable poet was Jorge Luis Borges. A nauseating and inexplicably repellent view of Kipling's work was penned in 1942 by George Orwell, otherwise a distinguished, if plagiaristic, novelist. Huston's memorably masterful film can be considered a metaphor for the rise and fall of the British Empire, as observed and objectively recorded by its literary genius. The Empire was not founded by little men; but high and mighty pride precedes a fall. Some of the low-star reviews on this site are unbelievably inane.",

This is a time before globalism and political correctness and when men were men. Michael Caine and Sean Connery play the parts with great enthusiasm and humour and are realistic in their portrayal of men who have been Soldiers and are Free Masons.

I rented a DVD a few nights ago and they had a special features segment. Did you know that John Huston owned the rights to this film for -- get this -- 25 years!! And that he originally planned to have the characters of Peachey and Daniel played by Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable!! In my \"notso\" humble opinion, I think the film did much better with the two British actors!!! And that except for the scenes in the mountain peaks, which were filmed in the French Alps, nearly all the outdoor scenes were filmed in Morocco!! The man who played the part of the high priest (sorry, I have forgotten his character's name) was 100 years old and was a shepherd!! After filming scenes in the daytime, he would return to his shepherd's job at night, with the result that for the duration of the filming he had practically no sleep!",

It does very realistically create the atmosphere of Asia which is where Kiplings story which is the basis of the script is set. It is a well done production.There are not many films where Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer are together. This film really benefits from all of them being here. The Kipling story of the land in East Afghanistan where no outsider has been since Alexander The Great is an interesting premise.The main weakness of the film is that Allied Artists who made it were on the verge of bankruptcy. In places that lack of money in the production shows very plainly. There are a few sequences which do not meld together well either and some special effects short cuts that are obvious.Still, the 3 pillars of the film that are strong carry the day. Connery and Caine play off each other quite well and the comic element written into the screen adaptation make the movie a good one. It is one of Alied Artists last film productions and it is rumored that the bankruptcy took any salary away from Connery and Caine and neither of them got paid for their work. If that legend is true, this might be some of the best free acting ever put on the screen.",

            "content": "THE FILM: In the mid 1950's, John Huston picked up a copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Man Who Would Be King. Huston felt the story would make a great film. He approached both Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable for the lead roles, and they accepted. Unfortunately, due to Bogart's death in 1957, the project stalled. Interest was regained during the making of The Misfits, when Clark Gable expressed his desire to do the film. Unfortunately, due to Gable's death in 1961, the film was once again shelved.It would be brought up in conversation now and then, with names like Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas attached. Nothing came of it, and the project was yet again shelved. Finally in 1973, during the making of The Mackintosh Man Huston approached Paul Newman about doing the film, with Robert Redford. Newman thought the film sounded excellent, but if the film was to be about British men, British actors should be cast. Newman mentioned Sean Connery and Michael Caine as possible leads.Huston thought the idea excellent, and immediately contacted the two. Both agreed, and the shooting commenced in Morocco. It would be the last large scale epic Huston would ever tackle.THE PLOT: Rudyard Kipling is the author of a newspaper in Victorian era India, and one night as he types the next day's paper, a figure in rags approaches him. It comes with great shock to him when he realizes that this is a man he had befriended years prior. Indeed, it is Peachy Carnahan, whom Kipling had met when Peachy stole his watch. Carnahan begins to tell the story of his adventures, with fellow rogue Daniel Dravot.Years earlier, they had the idea to walk to the mystical land of Kafiristan, where no man has been since Alexander. The idea was to make peace with the warring tribes, and set themselves up as kings. After many sidesteps, they reach their destination and kick their plan into action. After Dravot is hit with an arrow, blocked by an ammunition belt, the local populace think him a god. After a great coincidence, he becomes the ruler of the land, and people worship him.Unfortunately, Dravot begins to think himself an actual god...THE CRITICISM: If ever the phrase \"they don't make 'em like they used to\" is applicable, this is a shining example. This kind of epic, big budget swashbuckling adventure is distinctly old Hollywood, but also incredibly entertaining. The film balances drama with comedy, adventure and greed, and does it flawlessly. This film hits all the right buttons, and then even more. Caine and Connery have tremendous camaraderie and their friendship is one of the most believable of all time.Indeed, in their performances, they exude a remarkable charm and drama. Caine, as Peachy Carnahan is charming, dangerous and greedy, while the same can be said for Connery's Daniel Dravot. Those who know Connery only as James Bond will be in for a shock when they see this film. He proves that he can not only act, but act well. For those who know Caine as an old man, will be surprised to see that in his youth he was an excellent actor.Christopher Plummer, in the role of Kipling is absolutely excellent. He is the lens through which you observe the story. The many years, and drafts of the screenplay, definitely show. All of that time in pre-production result in a perfectly realized script, and film. The score, by Maurice Jarre can be too much at points, but is still quite moving, especially in the last scene. The cinematography is beautiful, although it might feel slightly old school at points, so is the film.Too many epics find that with a big budget, the film must be intense and brooding drama. As Huston realizes here, that is not the case at all. With a big budget, he manages to craft an excellent, drama that doesn't mind verging on the comic at points. This is but one of the many literary adaptations Huston would tackle throughout his long career. As is the case with almost all of those films, I have not read the source material. From my understanding Rudyard Kipling was an actual British writer, who at one point did live in India.I am once again bring light on Huston's direction. He brings a masterful touch to the proceedings, crafting what could even be considered satirical by some. The film comes together through his direction, and indeed I cannot think of many directors whose range extends as far as Huston. If there was ever a running theme throughout his films, it is greed. This is no exception.As I wrap up, I call attention to the last scene of the film. To those who have seen it, and those who haven't, I believe you might be able to sympathize with me when I call attention to the incredibly moving nature of the ending. The singing was an incredibly sad and fitting end to this, one of the greatest epics ever made.The Man Who Would Be King, 1975, Starring: Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Christopher Plummer, Directed by John Huston, 9.5/10 (A) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston film.

            "review_title": "A memorable epic adventure",
            "content": "\"The Man Who Would be King\" is based on Rudyard Kipling's famous short story of the same name. It centres on a pair of scoundrels who, fresh from military service in India, hatch a plan to trek to Kafiristan and lead the locals in combat, eventually gaining the throne through their heroics (or so the plan goes).The two stars of the film, Michael Caine and Sean Connery, were well chosen and deliver a pair of fine performances. Among the supporting cast I thought that Saeed Jaffrey (as Billy Fish) was easily the best of the lot.From a technical standpoint the film is also well done. The Middle Eastern setting and presence of a Maurice Jarre score beg comparison with \"Lawrence of Arabia\", which is a tough yardstick for any film. Huston's direction is impressive but not as breathtaking as Lean's while Jarre's score isn't nearly as memorable as his earlier work. On the whole, though, this film is an excellently crafted epic (although perhaps a trifle short for the 'epic' moniker).In conclusion, if you enjoy epic films then this one is a must-see. It seems to be mostly overlooked these days but I'd say that's only because it arrived after the golden age of epic movie-making.",

            "content": "This movie is loosely based on the Kipling short story by the same title, but for once the adaptation is a big improvement. In the short story, there is much less character development, and the Daniel character is allowed to dominate; in the movie, the two main characters get a fairly balanced exposure.The result is one of the great adventure stories, and at the same time a great Shakespearean tragedy. In this respect, it can be compared to that other Huston masterpiece: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.Yet, even this high praise does not do full justice to the movie, because I have not yet mentioned the scenery, the music, and, most important, the two unforgettable main characters. Daniel and Peachy are crooks and megalomaniacs, but, on the whole, it is hard not to sympathize with them: because it's only a movie, of course, but also because of their quiet self-confidence and dry sense of humor; because they do not lose dignity in failure; and because, for all their flaws, one can sense that they have lived interesting lives, and wishes to hear them tell their stories.Sometimes Daniel and Peachy treat the natives pretty shabbily, but only on one occasion I thought that they would behave differently to a white man. This occasion, unfortunately, is at the very beginning of the movie, in the train scene. You should not let this scene alienate you from the Peachy character, because you won't see him behave like that again.There are a few remarks that might offend the overly sensitive, such as: \"(we are) not gods, but Englishmen, which is the next best thing!\". (Incidentally, this might have been inspired by Cecil Rhodes.) But this remark should be seen in its context. It is pretty clear that Daniel and Peachy believe themselves to be close to gods, not because they are British, but because they are Daniel and Peachy. They are quite happy to make fun of their fellow Britons and of the entire colonial enterprise: witness lines such as \"It was detriment like us that built this bloody Empire!\" or \"We are going to teach you (...) to slaughter your enemies like civilized men.\"From their talk to Kipling and to the District Commissioner, one gets pretty soon the picture of the individualistic, libertarian philosophy of Daniel and Peachy. Perhaps this is best encapsulated in their conversation when they are trapped at high altitude and expect to die from exposure. They consider whether their lives have been wasted, and decide that they would not go back even on the point of dying, if that means giving up on their memories. Without giving anything away, I can say that their best memories were yet to come.",

            "content": "If you rate foremost by sheer entertainment, then yes, for me this John Huston gem is arguably the best adventure put on film, ever. I love Apocalypse Now, and Lawrence of Arabia, and several classic films perhaps even greater than this Caine/Connery collaboration, but this could best all the greats for sheer fun. I can understand that Huston's other masterpiece, \"The African Queen,\" might appeal more to women; the interplay between Hepburn and Bogart was incredible. The love interest in The Man Who Would Be King is deliberately cold and minimal, in part because it is the ultimate \"buddy movie\", which might be pejorative, but not intended so. It's a transcendent buddy movie, part epic, part comic, part morality tale. It seems strange that 1% of critics were underwhelmed. When positive consensus is that close, one has to wonder how one or two \"experts\" could diverge so much from the glories piled on by the many critic worthies, like Roger Ebert, who adored it: I trust him more than some half-baked know-it-all form Variety for appreciation of the art of film making.Based on a Rudyard Kipling short story, itself inspired by the true story of Josiah Harlan in mid-19th century Afghanistan, it is the rare film that is better than its own source material by any measure. Also, you can find dozens of great movies starring Michael Caine, but here is one of the handful of really great movies that did not squander the massive talents of Sean Connery. For this last reason alone, The Man Who Would Be King is a must- see.",

            "content": "A classy John Huston action yarn that melds high adventure with an abundance of belly laughs, \"The Man Who Would Be King\" stands high because of the brilliance of its two leads and Huston's undeniable craft.Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine) and Danny Dravot (Sean Connery) are former soldiers in Her Majesty's army who dare to dream big on the Indian subcontinent. Making the acquaintance of a newspaper reporter named Rudyard Kipling, they hatch a plan to travel across forbidding mountains and appoint themselves rulers of a distant, fabled land - then rob the place four ways from Sunday. They expect it will be all in a day's work for two enterprising Britishers.\"We're not little men, so we're going away to become kings,\" Peachy tells Kipling.\"We hear they have two and thirty idols there, so we'll be the 33rd and 34th,\" adds Danny.Of course, it's Huston directing, and co-writing the script with Gladys Hill, so they may want to bone up on how \"Treasure Of Sierra Madre\" turned out before venturing forth.Watching Connery work here is a revelation. Gone is much of the suavity he made his name with playing James Bond. He presents us with Danny as a bit of a dunce, caught up as Danny is in the role he is playing until he literally plays out his string. Connery sings, he dances, he even forswears women, until meeting a beauty played by Caine's real-life wife who proves his undoing.You really shouldn't root for these guys, con-men that they are, except for the way they interact. Peachy's the brains of the outfit, the one who says they should \"pull stumps and run,\" but your heart is with Danny, who wanted to be another thieving king but gets caught up with bigger dreams.Caine's performance is every bit as good as Connery's, though he plays more in tune with his typical screen character. The banter between them, like that of Butch and Sundance in another film, really makes this work, and it's Caine who pushes most of the tension. His reaction shots throughout the film, especially as Danny begins to spin out of his control, are subtle but solid, giving Connery the room to carve out one of his greatest character performances.There's a wonderful moment, among many, when they find themselves in a treasure trove that's theirs to take away. The look in their eyes tells you this is no happy occasion, but a moment of real fear. Peachy licks one golden bauble and tells Danny, very tentatively, that \"it ain't brass.\"There ain't much brass to be seen here, with the amazing scenics and compositions on display. Making a film in the fabled age of the auteur, Huston nevertheless works from an older school that prizes storytelling over vision. The result is a film out of time, and one of the best in this great director's career.It does run long, and the story gets thin as it gets to the end, spun as it is from a Kipling short story. \"The Man Who Would Be King\" doesn't have the rewatchability of many great films. But it has its own kind of greatness, and may leave you at the end with a lump in your throat.",

The locales are not Central Asia but instead French mountain ranges and Moroccan exotic backdrops.  The extras work well to convey masses of Asian commoners and priest/monks of the Buddhist/Hindu religion.  Other comment sharers can review for you the plot details and give praise to lead actors Connery and Caine (also Plummer as supporting actor); my USER COMMENT will instead focus on this film as a parable about colonialism and the developing world.  The script carefully locates the decade and background to be the 1890's at the dawn of the British Victorian Empire that subjugated many parts of world civilizations in decline or pre-modern capacity.  The Kipling story from which the film takes inspiration tethers us to a time and place when that world superpower's \"superiority\" has enjoyed days of golden antiquity theft and widespread profitmaking and despoiling.  The heroes of this piece are actually villainous, second-rate crooks who become entangled in a web of deceit that they spun themselves.  As would-be \"strip-miners\" of the tribal and religious powers-that-had-been in the fictious land past Afghanistan, the duo plus translator/stooge get access to the treasure trove of the civilization but fall prey to basic sins and character flaws.The \"man who would be king\" lets power go to his head as did victors in the Colonial expansionist ages of the past and present.  By their doomed attempt to get everything away from the underprivileged, the would-be Colonialistic oppressors get their comeuppance.  Such Western macho consumerists, despite some feeble self-serving propaganda, are still human and vulnerable.  Their divine pronouncements to \"know it all\" receive exposure in the end as having been cheap imitations of what life is really all about.  Down with such \"god-kings\" who deserve the bites of the weak who are about to be raped!  Their downfall will not be slow-motion sequences but swift thwacks of the Reaper's scythe.  The true and valid relationship of the developed, Western nations toward those sheltered by remoteness must be one of co-development along with democratic progress and humanitarian improvement.  Unfortunately, the world powers didn't learn a whole lot from such 19th century parables during 1901-2000; let's hope that Asian peoples will have their stories told and lay hold on the attention of the world for longer than just the \"run\" of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON from last year.

I did back in '74. Don't now. What I do still delight in, though, are the performances of Sean Connery as the deluded title character and Caine as his more realistic sidekick, as well as Maurice Jarre's beautiful score and, most of all, John Huston's skill at cinematic storytelling. I mean, this director's ability, as he enters his late sixties, to weave serious themes of megalomania and sic transit glory with action/adventure is fairly awesome.

The ending is truly great and ironic. Sad and full of hope at the same time.It almost made me cry. Connery and Caine have great chemistry and I wonder why they never had another pairing in a movie, which is a truly pitiful.This movie is a true classic worthy of being seen again again.

In any case i found this on HBO/Max and was thouroughly entertained. Director John Huston had some hits and a few misses in his career (that last offering of his I watched is the over-rated \"The Misfits\") but he does a grand job of retelling the Rudyard Kipling tale. Connery and Caine seem to have a lot of fun playing a pair who are either somewhat lovable grifters, con-men, saviors or mercenaries, depending on what role is needed.

They are great actors and we lap them up on screen. Funny, though, I rented this because Saeed Jaffrey was in it playing \"Billy Fish.\" I enjoyed watching Saeed in the Merchant-Ivory pictures and in the British thriller \"Killing Kind,\" and in the new pyx w/ Burt Reynolds set in Amsterdam called \"Snapshots.\" These guys have such appealing chutzpah together and twinkle along with preposterous schemes and grandiose impulses, and they have a kind of honor about friendship and loyalty. Guided by a lot of luck, they do manage to take over leadership of a small, devout country that accepts the Masonic emblem as proof of Connery's Divinity! What a comedic romp this becomes. And Sean, at first Solomon-like in his wisdom,soon becomes tarnished and, with veiled lasciviousness, decides to wed. That sets off the old Dudes who were the Guiding Gurus before Connery got there. Michael Caine should not have stuck around for the wedding. Caine was ready to split because he couldn't stomach the direction Connery was going in, with the Kingship Routine and the hedonism. But Caine DID stick around and when the wedding day dawned, and when the bride BIT Connery and he BLED, well, the Old Dude Gurus gave the go-ahead for the mob of citizenry to give Connery 'what fer.' And they managed to do this. Caine lived thru it all to come back and regale Kipling (what a terrific, never-before-seen job of underplaying a role Chrisopher Plummer did here - he was simply magnificent and I did not recognize the actor in any way/shape/form as accustomed to him by his later roles)with the entire story. This is an original tale. The photography was luscious. It makes you appreciate John Huston's work all the more. Some movie people you just don't wanna see age. And that applies to Caine, Connery, Huston, Plummer, and certainly not the fine Saheed Jaffrey, whose cultured speaking intonations are thrilling to hear and who has aged to perfection, now around 76. I hope the movie-makers will utilize this gentleman in good roles of grace and meaning until he is too old to memorize dialogue! This is a great film for younger people to go back and see. It will remind them of their own fragile humanity and give them an idea of the passage of time and the parade of viable and gifted humans who inhabit our earth.",

But Huston saw it as tale of the human spirit, and that is what comes through as we follow the misadventures of Danny and Peachy. In another film, a lesser film, these characters and their actions would be judged, especially in today's culturally sensitive world. Not so here, as Huston's gift for getting to the marrow combines with the top-grade acting skills of Sean Connery and Michael Caine to get us past the morally ambiguous details of the story and fill us with admiration for the heroism of these two deplorable rogues. Best of all, it is a rousing adventure yarn that truly makes you think- at moments when you least expect it. It is one of those rare films that imparts complex wisdom through simplicity. And although it is a 30-year old film of a 50-year old idea based on a 100-year old story, it is not dated- the underlying observations about imperialism are eerily relevant to our world today.",

This is classic story-telling at its best for the most unsophisticated and most erudite among us. Michael Caine's wife Shakira plays Roxanne for you trivia buffs.

This is the ultimate of buddy, road-trip films similar to Easy Rider or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. You're supposed to enjoy the ride even if there's foreshadowing that things don't end right. At the same time, there's a Doctor Zhivago aspect of a grand epic. The scenery is stunning as is the whole scope of the film. In Doctor Zhivago, you know from the beginning how the tale ends and you almost forget it because of 3 hours of grand (although sad) story. In this one, the two hours seem to fly by. The jokes and clever human insights are thrown out, at several levels (both vaudeville as well as more subtle) faster than than you can follow along or laugh. The material is wonderfully unPC by today's standards and consequently, a few (few) reviewers were turned off by it but simultaneously, it was a film of it's times (the 1960's, the late Victorian era, and even the cultures portrayed in the film) that you feel immersed and drawn in. This Is An Epic Film. Like life, sometimes we are too busy having a good time, or not, to stop and smell the roses. You can do that after a 2nd viewing which I guarantee you'll want to have.",

            "content": "Is it really possible to hate a movie like The Man Who Would Be King? While it is understandable that it may not be your favorite movie, you just can't help enjoying at least some parts of the movie. At the same time nothing stands out about The Man Who Would Be King. The acting, directing, and story, all good, but none of them stand out as defining or extremely memorable. But this movie is still remembered and praised over thirty years later. Why is that? It's because, while nothing about The Man Who Would Be King excels, nothing about it is bad either.Told through a flashback, the man who would be king tells the story of two con men, played by Michael Cane and Sean Connery, who decide to con an entire country for its wealth wealth. After tracking across deserts and frozen mountain peaks, the two men come to the fictional country of Kafiristan, which is made up of about thirty warring tribes. After picking one of the tribes they began to train the natives to fight the other tribes with the intent of eventually taking over and unifying the entire country. However one of the men, Daniel Dravot (Connery), survives an arrow shot in battle and is mistaken for a god. Using this newfound advantage the two Englishmen began to take control of the entire country. The story is interesting and told well enough that the viewer does not get bored watching it, yet at the same time the turn of event throughout the movie feel almost inevitable. Its like reading a mystery aimed for young readers where and older and more advanced reader has spotted the fairly obvious clues and solved the mystery by chapter four.The choice of putting Connery and Caine together for this movie seems like an unusual choice but was an undeniably successful one. Film critics have compared their teaming up to that of others such as Robert Redford and Paul Newman. Connery and Caine play very different characters that feel like they should be conflicting with each other but instead each seems to complement the other nicely. Connery is reserved and stone faced through out the movie. Confident in his beliefs and determined to get them Connery pulls of the character so quietly that you can almost forget that you are watching Sean Connery on the screen. Michael Caine is another story altogether. Loud, crass, rebellious and fun loving, Caine's character of Peachy Carnehan almost seems like a young boy trapped inside an mans body. Throughout the movie Caine is the one who speaks back to authority and makes witty remarks to everyone that he meets. Both actor's strongest moment is in the same scene when they are arguing, and ironically the almost seem to be playing each other. Connery, while still quiet and stone faced wants to say where he is enjoying life, and Caine while still being a loud and crass character plays the more mature one who recognizes that they both need to leave.If there is one thing that can be considered epic about The Man Who Would Be King, it is the stunning scenery that is shown throughout the movie. Wide shots that show extensive deserts can take the audiences breath away with the raw beauty that is captured on footage. During a sequence where the heroes attempt to cross a mountain range, there is almost a montage of still clips of jagged cliffs and snow capped mountain peaks. Combining this sequence with almost the perfect music, it is one of the most captivating things in the entire movie. Even when majestic landscapes weren't being shown, the scenery was still captivating. The opening shots are of a market place in India, and while I knew ahead of time that they were actually filmed in morocco it had me believing that I was seeing an authentic Indian marketplace.Set in the 1800s this movie takes place around the end of British exploration and colonization. While the political message is subtle, it does seem to stand against colonization. The Man Who Would Be King shows all of the negative effect that come about by forcing a modern society onto an uncivilized people. Rudyard Kipling, the writer of the original short story was very much in love with the wild and the unknown that was left in the world and probably felt that the colonization of the British was taking away what unknown was left. Director John Huston had long been a fan of the original short story by Kipling and had wanted to make a movie of it for some time. In fact he had gotten the rights to the story early in the 50s hoping to use other actors. When he tried to get Paul Newman, who he had worked with in The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean, to be in the movie, it was Newman who suggested using Connery and Caine.All in all, The Man Who Would Be King is a memorable movie. It does not inspire you or make any shocking political statement but it does thoroughly entertain you for two hours. Fifty years from now, Film historians will probably not look back on it and say that it was one of the most defining movies of our time. But fifty years from now they will probably still know what it is.",

The key to this movie working, which I think Huston recognized, is in the chemistry between the two leads. And I don't think anyone could have fit these roles better than Michael Caine. Individually they fit their respective parts well; Caine leaning into that familiar cheeky sort of charm while Connery reaches into that outer-Bond range he so desperately wanted to demonstrate. Yet what fully ties it together is what they create between them. Their real life friendship seeps into the film or perhaps more than seeps, it is the movie. The rest of the film is okay but it's a lot of meandering on arid locations that's more plot than character.",

Even a stinker like Ralph Meeker's \"Iceman\" in \"Big House USA\" gives one a desire to root for him - even though he's a real schmuck! I was really disappointed at the end when Peachy drops in on Kipling with his bag. I expected for him to pull the huge ruby from it's depths and say that Peachy was living fat and sassy among the natives as their ruler, but nooooo! It brings to mind Addison Richards' ill-fated character Krofton in 1940's \"Northwest Passage\" where he asks the other rangers if they're hungry......\"Hungry? - I'm not!\" He just happens to have the severed head of an Abanaki Indian in his bag that he, ahem, uses in place of trail mix.....Get my drift?",

            "content": "The Man Who Would be King is a film about colonialism. It illustrates the notion that the arrogance of the West leads to a dangerous sense of empowerment.There is much to admire in The Man Who Would be King. Huston's direction and the work of his cinematographer is breath taking. The pace and premise of the film are superbly crafted, and the camaraderie and timing displayed by Sean Connery and Michael Caine are the centerpiece of the film.\nYou realize that these two work extremely well together, at least on film, (lord knows how well these two got along off camera). It makes you wonder why they did not work together more often after this.The film also takes a stab at the 'old boys' networks, the fact that men will claim loyalty to vague and distant ideals, tribes and clubs for no reason and at great expense. It wonderfully ties the notion these networks pre-date our civilization, even pre-date Christ and yet they continue to exert tremendous influence over us. Is a warring tribe any different than a warring nation? Is a Free Mason any different than a colonial soldier, or a high priest dedicated to some temple on a mountain? Our belief systems are forged with two notions, inclusion and exclusion. If you are 'in' you benefit from the club's power, if you are 'out', you feel that tribe's wrath.Every loyalty that is forged in this film is exposed for its hypocrisy and the lies underneath that fuel it. There is only one loyalty that seems to be genuine in this film and that is the friendship between Caine and Connery. Everything else is a rouse, to gain power and to condone war.If the film falls short, it's in the portrayal of the natives as utter barbarians with no redeeming values. Now to be fair, the country they portray is fictitious and the contrast is there for comedic value, but just consider the film opens in India, and rather than show the Taj Mahal or the beautiful music and art of India, it goes into a large montage of scorpion eaters and snake snatchers.We're lead to believe, that England had no right to lead a barbaric culture, no matter how much 'good' that leadership might have brought. The reasoning behind this film's morale is that England's perceived superiority is a lie, and is in fact, based on the same tribal fears and prejudices as the people England are colonizing.The story has strange holes and some laughably implausible incidents to keep the story going. There are moments that make you wince, Saeef Jaffrey's character who seems the most grounded of all, suddenly snaps to his death, for no particular reason other than to rid him from the story line. There are also candid moments, like when Connery begins to question the incredible happenstance that has taken place, and questions that perhaps life is destiny rather than series of meaningless and random events.\nOf course, the ending of the film, refutes destiny, it in fact implies we yearn to craft destiny out of meaningless coincidence just because our superstitions and our tribe affiliations yearn for meaning.In reality, this is more of a comedy than a drama, the film works best when it doesn't take itself too seriously. With a destitute Caine returning to India to tell his tale and morale, that \u0091no man should play god', the shock value of the final minute of the film, doesn't quite register, because for the most part, we've just been chuckling along.Despite my nit-picking, this is a fine film, crafted from great text, shot wonderfully in breath taking locales, with a superb pace and rapport amongst its central characters. You get pieces of adventure, drama, comedy and a nice little morale in the end, to make you think. What more can you ask for?",

            "content": "Based on a story by Rudyard Kipling, this is one of those films that I've always wanted to see but never managed to, until today. The gods of time were always against me with this one\u0085 I'd always turn over when it was half way through, or there would be something else I wanted to see on the other side, but I finally bagged & tagged it today! A film of great scope with a lot of action and adventure, it keeps you guessing until the end. I enjoyed it, with a few reservations, but more of that after this brief summary.Late one night, a shadowy figure visits reporter, Rudyard Kipling, in his office in India. The visitor is Peachy Carnehan, and he is there to tell Kipling a tale. He reminds Kipling that they had previously met three years ago when he had witnessed a contract between Peachy and his colleague, and friend, Daniel Dravot. The two men, latter-day confidence tricksters, had recently left the army in India and had decided to go and seek their fortune in the little-known land of Kafiristan. The contract stated that they would abstain from alcohol and women for the duration of their adventure\u0085 amongst other things. They set off and after a torturous journey they finally arrive. Having scared off some natives with their rifles, they are surprised to find a Ghurkha living in one of the villages. He was the only survivor of a geological expedition several years earlier. This man, known as 'Billy Fish' would act as interpreter for the pair. And so they begin their rise to power by persuading the leader of the village to let them train their men so they can defeat all his enemies. Things continue in a similar vein until Daniel is hit with an arrow that doesn't kill him in a battle. Word of this gets back to the holy city of the region and the pair is summoned. I won't say any more because what happens next is key to the whole plot & I don't want the Spoiler Police raising an army and chasing me down.Very well made a beautifully shot, but you wouldn't expect anything less from the likes of John Huston. Great performances all round, particularly from Sean Connery as Daniel Dravot and Michael Caine as Peachy Carnehan, they seemed to spark off each other really well. It's a shame they haven't made more films together on this evidence. Also worthy of note were Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling and Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish.There is some great dialogue in this film and it is delivered with great aplomb by both leading actors. They are supposed to be common men; non-commissioned officers of her majesty's army, and that's just what they speak like. Very much an old-fashioned adventure film, it really delivers on that front. I mentioned there was a problem with it though, and it's that it's just too damn long, you could easily lose thirty minutes of the running time from the beginning and the film would be just as good, if not better (in my book). If it wasn't for this I would have definitely scored it higher, but even so, it still a great film and comes with my seal of approval\u0085 Recommended.My Score: 7.8/10.IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 20,799 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96/100 (based on 23 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",

The physically ruined yet indomitable Peachy is off to the same junction that served as a starting point for his grand adventure with Danny. Danny's grotesquely shriveled head still wears a hollow king's crown but Peachy leaves it as a reminder that it is not the destination but the shared journey that makes life worth living. Friendship, loyalty, exercising and improving upon your skills and pushing the limits of your endurance is what Huston himself seemed to enjoy and are key to his adventure films.",

The portrayal of virtually every character in this film is so comically exaggerated it borders on b-movie exploitation and prevents the movie from ever achieving even the slightest impact dramatically. The \"action\" scenes have all the power of an elementary school stage play and not one line delivered by the fine actors ever strikes a truly emotional chord in the entire film. I love Plummer, Connery, and Caine but even their combined talent cannot help the movie find redemption with a viewer that possesses remotely modern sensibilities. It simply cannot hold up as a \"classic\" the way even far older films like Casablanca, Sunset Blvd., or those by Sergio Leone, Hitchcock, Welles, Lumet, etc. all can and do. When I think about the fact that this was made 3 years AFTER The Godfather, and the very same year as One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, I am actually downright embarrassed for everyone that participated in the making of this.",

            "content": "What a peculiar story! It's almost a philosophical tale, and certainly not what I expected when I chose to watch this movie (I haven't read the original work). The Caine/Connery duo works terrifically well and is in my opinion the main attraction to \"The man who would be king\". Although the story was thrilling enough for me never to be bored, I thought that the direction lacked rhythm, especially in the first two thirds of the movie. In fact, I thought that this movie suffered from the same problem as some other literary adaptations that give the impression that they rest too much on their source material and struggle to find their own unity.I've always enjoyed \"exotic\" adventure stories, written at a time where a big part of the world could still be a mystery, even if it means putting up with the condescending attitude of the westerners of the time. Of course, today, the Victorian Englishmen are hardly less exotic to us than their oriental contemporaries. I don't know what the tone of Kipling's short story was, but the movie, at least, seemed to me to be watching the protagonists with a distance appropriate for our time, without, however, cutting us completely from any identification or empathy (it would have lost much of its impact otherwise). In a few words, I had a lot of fun watching this movie, but I didn't find it memorable. The actors' performances, on the other hand, are (the actor playing Billy Fish was excellent, too!) and they're well worth the watch.",

They put out a contract to confirm a few rules for their journey through Afghanistan, a contract that is signed by Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer) as a witness. Some years later, Carnehan returns to Kipling\u00b4s office and tells him the story of his journey with Dravot. Plummer\u00b4s character is less flamboyant than any of the other characters, but Rudyard Kipling is actually the most important person in this story: what we are watching is his experience of Carnehan telling him about what happened to them.A great movie with splendid acting that makes you laugh as well as cry...",

These rogue con-men make their living trapesing across the country and eventually they set their sights on exploring a part of the world which the white man has not been to since Alexander the Great. The mission is to infiltrate the warring tribes of Kafiristan, lead them against one another, and then set themselves up as kings amongst the victors.The chemistry between Michael Caine and Sean Connery is absolutely phenomenal and to witness it is worth the price of admission alone. The story captures the very essence of adventure in exploring the unknown and becoming master of all that one can see, and what better man to bring it to the screen and to direct but John Huston of \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", \"The Red Badge of Courage\" and \"The African Queen\" all under his belt. Saeed Jaffrey as 'Billy Fish' provides a solid supporting performance and complements the duo by making this, by the conclusion, a trio in a land that Marlowe from the aforementioned Conrad tale would have equally found as perilous and wonderful as the heart of darkness as Africa.",

Further, though the acting was not shabby, I guess I was not as impressed by the performances as many others were. I understand that most movies require a certain suspension of disbelief. However, this movie had SO MANY bizarre coincidences that I could not stomach it (avalanche scene, rationale for not wanting a character to marry, and MANY actions of the priests). The cinematography was stunning at times, but the effect was often undone with loud and pretentious music in the background. I really cannot comprehend how this film got 4 Oscar nominations.

            "review_title": "The Adventures of Two Adventurers or the White Gods of Karifistan",
            "content": "Adventure. The film adaptation of the story of the same name by the famous English writer Rudyard Kipling, which in turn is based on real events. And since I have nothing to say for the book source (because I haven't read it), I will evaluate the film adaptation as an independent work. Of course, I understand that the topic of Afghanistan is very hot right now, but the picture was chosen for viewing long before the flight of the\" exceptional nation \"from bearded shepherds with kalash, so do not write in the comments that the author is\" hyping \" on a hot topic. This is not true. One of the reasons that prompted me to watch this movie was the participation of the late Sean Connery and Michael Caine here, and even in the main roles. And here is my brief opinion for you-The adventures of two adventurers. There were both pros and cons in the picture, and therefore I finish the introduction and get to the point, so to speak.So, the pros:\n1. Scenario - two friends, former soldiers of the British army, and now adventurers decided on a bold raid to the north - to get to Afghanistan, or rather to the historical region of Karifistan, and become no less than the rulers of these possessions. They conclude a contract, and take the journalist Rudyard Kipling as a witness. And so begins this adventure, full of danger, ups and downs, hope and despair. And although the ending is guessed almost from the very beginning, the viewer is still interested in finding out how this event happened and what happened to the characters throughout this journey. The writers hooked the viewer with this hook, and did not let him go right up to the final credits. There is of course one point that slightly spoils the impression, but I will tell you about it below. In general, the script can be called successful, the characters are prescribed, and the production is great.2. Full-scale shooting - unfortunately, everything was shot not in Afghanistan (due to many reasons, including due to the difficult political situation), but in Morocco, beloved by Hollywood, where the terrain resembles that of Afghanistan. Nevertheless, the picture was a success, because the viewer believes in what is happening. Especially captivating are various little things, such as the way of life of local residents, their mores and the huge difference between them and the heroes who arrived.3. Fights and battles-of course not\" War and Peace \" by Bondarchuk, but it looks tolerable, because it would be stupid to expect large-scale battles with the participation of several tens of thousands of people from this picture, so we were shown not very many such scenes. And it looks good for the mid-seventies. But even in these moments, you feel tension and even fear for the heroes, despite their combat experience.4. The music is quite entertaining, because it almost did not remind of itself, but when it happened, it blew up the brain with its compositions. It clearly does not pull at a masterpiece (and it will never pull), but within the framework of this picture it is a good option.5. Humor - I was even surprised at its presence, but in the end I was satisfied with it. Typical British humor. It is served in a dosed manner, there is no overkill, and it pleasantly dilutes this adventure.6. Conclusions - the picture leaves behind a rich food for thought about many things: about power and the way to achieve it, how to preserve it, comparing a person with God, about the \"civility\" and \"barbarism\" of different peoples, the conflict of cultures, the price of human decisions, responsibility,friendship and a lot more. This is what distinguishes a good movie from a bad one, because the bad does not leave anything behind, because you do not want to think about it, it does not teach anything, it just exists, and it wants to earn money. This picture is a typical representative of a good movie, which every viewer is simply obliged to think about.So, the cons:\n1. Tightness - with all the advantages of this picture, it is worth honestly admitting that it is monotonous and in some dreams even slow, and it is the script that is to blame. I can't even imagine myself what could be reduced so that the picture would get rid of this flaw. But you can't go against the facts. Alas!I thought about the second minus for a long time, but I didn't remember anything, so we move on!A little about the main characters:\n1. Daniel Drevott, played by Sean Connery , is one of the adventurers who set out to become the rulers of Karifistan. A smart, cunning and cheerful guy who gets a chance to become a living God for the locals. But will he be able to pass this test of power? After all, there are many temptations. Sean Connery is a master of his craft, and he definitely succeeded in the role of this adventurer. Bravo!2. Peachy Carnegan, played by Michael Caine , is a cautious friend of Daniel, who is infected with the idea no less than him. He is also a cheerful and cheerful person who turned out to be much more prescient than his friend. And Michael Caine masterfully performed this role and caused much more sympathy, although both of them, in fact, are antiheroes. Bravo, Michael!3. Rudyard Kipling, played by Christopher Plummer , is a casual acquaintance of friends who turned out to be at a good time and in a good place. He is a witness to their contract and a bright secondary hero. Kipling was shown truthfully, because he was a racist, at the same time a talented writer who knew the East perfectly, and Christopher Plummer could only transfer it all perfectly to the screen, which he did.A thinking picture, a fascinating picture, a good picture that I dug up completely by accident, and about which little is known, which is sad. Maybe at least this review will open the veil over her a little. I am amused by this reliable one.As a result, we have a good adventure movie, with a good script that makes you think about a lot, good music, battle scenes and great acting works.My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",

These men had never worked an honest day's work in their lives: they stole, robbed and used every trick in the book to gain profits by tricking people. At their arrival, they wasted no time introducing themselves to the people or the land by shooting some of their enemies. They quickly gained fame by teaching the men to fight and to conquer their enemies one at a time. During one the battles, Connery's character was shot with an arrow in the heart, but did not die or bleed. He quickly was deemed a God and was thought to be the Son of Alexander The Great. Connery's character used the ruse of the arrow to become king of all of the land. He had wealth, fame and fortune for the rest of his life, but wanted more: a wife (this was forbidden by the priests because a God could not marry a mortal). On the day of the wedding, a simple bite proved to be the turning point in the story. The men now had to run for their lives and was quickly outnumbered. Connery's character took the punishment full of song and still with a crown on his head.

I say this because when Sean Connery passed away I saw some respected film historians that listed this movie as the best film of his career; and when Christopher Plummer passed away I saw the same thing, and I was thinking, The Man Who Would Be King, better than The Insider or The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo?? I don't think so.Again, it's a good film, and I believe having the legendary John Huston Directing 3 actors that were and became even more legendary since the film was released in Sean Connery, Michael Caine & Christopher Plummer have caused film historians to rate a film that is good and rate it as great instead. Don't get me wrong, it is directed good, and Connery and Caine are good and they star alongside Plummer, and he is good also. The 4 legends did good together, and put out a good film, but not a great film as historians are trying to tell me.

            "content": "Saw quite a few movies in early 1976 and two of them stand out even after all these years: one is Barry Lyndon and the other is The Man Who Would Be King. So many people haven't heard of these films and I always recommend them. John Huston had been wanting to make this movie for years but wasn't able to until the 1970s. I think it was worth it, because he picked a great cast.It takes a while to get into The Man Who Would Be King, but once you're in, you're hooked. Danny & Peachy (brilliantly portrayed by Sean Connery & Michael Caine) are a couple of hell-raisers, stationed in India as part of the Queen's forces. They've done everything imaginable and are longing for a new adventure. They hear about a remote land beyond the mountains where no white man has gone since Alexander the Great. After almost killing themselves getting to this little place, they finally arrive--and, through a series of coincidences, Danny is crowned king. Who is he to tell the natives that they made a mistake? Danny & Peachy have a great time as the king & his consort (so to speak) until the natives find out that they've been hoodwinked; Danny is a mere mortal like everyone else. And they aren't too happy.I had to purchase the DVD because TV hardly ever showed this movie. But it's worth the price. John Huston directs a wonderful adventure story that stands the test of time.",

When I watched it as a child, I was so captivated by the movie that when Connery accepts fate in the bridge and starts singing, I could not help it and shouted: Sean, Run, Escape\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1 I almost cried.It is indeed a very good movie, one of my favorites. They do not really make movies like this anymore. This movie has pure magic for several reasons:1. It is a movie about unconditional Friendship. 2. It is a movie about the realization of a very old dream: a man who wants to conquer a kingdom. Many tried, most failed. In fact, Peachy and Daniel could have been the perfect mercenaries in the armies of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, Conqueror of M\u00e9xico, or Francisco Pizarro, Conqueror of Peru. Connery and Caine are two thoroughly unscrupulous buddies whose only redeeming qualities are their capacity for dreaming and their loyalty to each other. 3. This movie is indeed high adventure.The only thing i do not like in this movie, and the reason why i give it a six, it is because the whole freemasonry thing is totally unnecessary, a total sham. So, Alexander the Great was a mason, and a couple of English blokes who are masons too end up being kings of the Masonic Kingdom of Kafirist\u00e1n. That is just not believable, and destroys the story. As for the rest, the movie is just great: good script, superb actors in very fitting roles, good directions, good scenery, magic atmosphere, it is pure magic. Pity they blundered it with the stupid masonic twist, which is unnecessary, not realistic, and plain silly, as it borders the ridiculous. Nevertheless, it is a classic, it is good to watch, and it is indeed a very good movie.",

            "content": "Praised by critics as one of Huston's great films, this adaptation of an interesting story by Kipling is an adventure fantasy that narrates how two soldiers of the British Empire, by the mere fact of being soldiers, consider that they belong to no less than being kings of one of those miserable peoples who exist to be natural subjects of their majesties.The attitude is ambiguous: while they are clearly a pair of scoundrels, it is true that they are presented as likeable and endearing, two of those intrepid Britons whose courage, poise and knowledge made them natural lords of the land. Good old days.There is some make-up of anti-imperialist criticism, but underneath that superficial layer the film, with its playful and funny tone, is racist and colonialist to the core. It is not that this is exceptional in adventure films (or by the way in westerns, or in mystery films), and it falls within the conventions of the genre, so should not necessarily outrage us too much. But there is in this case a certain boast, a certain nostalgic pride that certainly bothers.The sense of humor is often unpleasant and crude, especially at the beginning of the film, as in that awful train scene in which Michael Caine tries to make us laugh by throwing a man from a running train.The final feeling is that the protagonists have been justly punished, but that is still a pity, because they were so nice!Apart from these problems for a current viewer, the film is somewhat slow in the first half, where the main adventure is the magnificent natural settings, and reasonably funny in its second half, where the narration takes the course of a children's story with content morals.Michael Caine and Sean Connery demonstrate their acting abilities, with an exaggerated, often ridiculous tone. Christopher Plummer as Kipling, brings the usual storyteller sanity.All in all it's a good adventure movie, but nothing exceptional. The film is counted among Huston's greatest hits, but it falls far short of the great masterpieces he made in the 1940s, '50s and early '60s.",

Something didn't add up though, this film fails to be the sum of all its parts. The film is over long and failed to fully grip me. It may be that I missed something or that Iam a philistine but to me it felt stilted and dated. Michael Caine described this as \"the only film I've done that will last after I'm gone\" but it is far out shone by his other works, such as the Italian Job, Get Carter, etc. In fact it is Caine that is the most guilty of overacting of the whole cast.",

That of course is due to it being directed by HUston who was a product of Hollywoods Golden Age.That is one of my favorite things about the film. I love that it is filmed in a elegant manner straight out of the Hollywood of yesteryear and does not at all look or feel like most films that saw release in the mid 70s.That said, without a great story and great characters that wouldn't matter much. Luckily the film as both. The story of two soldiers who head of to take over a little known country out of greed is simple yet epic.The film is filled with excitement, drama, humor, and more. It constantly keeps you drawn in. The acting is also top notch, it is likely Conery's best and may very well be Cain's as well.On a side note, the women who plays Roxanne is Cain's actual wife, he's a lucky man lol.",

If you have never seen it, you MUST track it down on DVD (I assume it's on DVD by now).The characters simply jump off the screen. They are vibrant and real and alive in a way Hollywood just doesn't capture very well any more. In fact, the only recent character who has the same panache is Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow.

I think the problem is that it doesnt quite know what it wants to be, either an action comedy romp (Butch and Sundance go to India, as one reviewer on here described it), or a serious and quite dark psychological exploration of the idea of suddenly acheiving absolute power. It falls between two stools, and as a result is not as good as it could have been if they had taken one treatment or the other to its full extent. What we are left with feels like the mutant offspring of Heart of Darkness and It Aint 'Alf Hot, Mum (a British comedy tv show set in India). If you liked the darker side of this, I suggest you read Heart of Darkness, and if you prefered the action, Butch Cassidy or The Sting would be a good choice. Caine and Connery clearly had a great time making this film, its just a pity the viewers cant quite share it. Still, it looks wonderful.6.5/10",

It has action and adventure, set in an exotic location, and it has an unbeatable cast.According to the stories I heard, director John Huston wanted to make this movie for many years. Apparently he first considered Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy and, later, Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole. I also heard that he also approached Paul Newman and Robert Redford.Eventually, he selected Michael Caine and Sean Connery, and, after seeing the movie, it was well worth the wait. Caine and Connery are terrific together as, respectively, the main characters Peachy Carnehan and Daniel Dravot. In addition, Christopher Plummer plays Kipling and Saeed Jaffrey is Gurkha soldier Billy Fish, who helps Peachy and Danny once they reach their destination. After seeing the movie, it's hard to imagine anyone else in those roles.Of course, a good movie requires an appropriate score and it's amply provided by Maurice Jarre, whose previous credits included \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and \"The Professionals\". It's hard to top someone like that.I first heard of \"The Man Who Would Be King\" soon after it was released and I saw the ads for it in newspapers and on television. Everyone I knew who saw it had high praise for it. I finally got to see it while I was an undergrad when the on-campus student cinema showed it in 1977. It lived up to its reputation and I went home knowing that I had just seen a wonderful film.This is one movie that has improved with time. Not only have I come to regard it as a classic, it's become one of my personal favourites and I look forward to adding it to my collection. It's excellent entertainment from beginning to end.",

The story really did not have anything to say and was unbelievable to boot. The idea that any group of people could so easily be persuaded to believe that a stranger had the qualities that made him worthy to be worshipped as a god is ridiculous. Perhaps Kipling thought that the people of India were so inferior to the British that they would do this, at least that is the way it came across in this story. There was no attempt to explore the personalities of the two leading characters portrayed by Sean Connery and Michael Caine, as a result, it was hard to identify with them or care about what could happen to them. Any actors could have been cast in their parts and would have done no worse. Perhaps this is why Connery and Caine never again appeared together again in another movie.

Then they defend themselves from desert raiders. The raiders using the accurate long Afgan rifles that caused the British army nightmares in the Khyber Pass. So it's very well research as well.

Huston's work provides perhaps the best pre-cursor to the \"Indiana Jones\" movies of the early 80's, as British mercenaries Carnahan and Dravot travel the seeming ends of the earth in 1800's South Asia, getting in and out of as much trouble as Connery's Bond character could ever hope to. Based on Runyard Kipling's novel,The movie is epic in it's adventure, but still deep enough to outline the philosophical roles of the king archetype as well as the absurdity of 19th century British imperialism. Connery (The man who longs to be king) climbs the traditional spire to monarchy through military prowess and the superstition of the masses, (not to mention a little luck!) Yet once king he suffers the same scrutiny that the pharaohs of Egypt and modern dictators face; a ruler's power rests with the people's contentment, when expected services are no longer delivered, the \"King\" will lose his mandate. Carnahan and Dravot are products of British imperialism, which operated on \"racial\" mandates of European supremecy. By the time Connery realizes the fallacy of his mindset(Like the tragic hero, when he begins to believe his own myth the downfall follows), it is too late.

Caine and Connery play Peachy Carnehan and Daniel Dravot, two quick witted rogue soldiers who desert the army at the time when the British empire ruled the world. Based on the Rudyard Kipling story, Christopher Plummer plays the author who first encounters the two men when the decide to set themselves up as rulers of the tribal Kafiristan, and plunder fame and fortune along the way. Plummer is merely a foil for the central duo, and is used sparingly, only really appearing at the beginning and end of the movie. Probably because of his hideous Graeme Souness moustache. Huston's masterful direction brings the best out of Connery and Caine, and as a double act they sparkle and fire off each other in every scene, almost in a brotherly, telepathic way. Indeed, it's Caine's early scenes, where he delivers quick fire lines in his broadest Cockney, that work exceptionally well, and as mentioned earlier, I often think this is some of Caine's best work that gets scandalously overlooked. People do refer to this movie once in a while, but always seem to just mention Caine, Connery and Huston. View it objectively, and from a Caine point of view you will see he totally nails the part and perhaps the great friendship he has endured with Connery off screen brings the best out of his performance on it. The turning point of the story is when the native tribesmen mistake Connery for a God when a stray arrow strikes him but he does not bleed. In fact, the arrow gets embedded in his bandolier which the locals do not realise. There is a masterful change of direction in the movie when Connery begins to lap up the total worship that suddenly befalls him, and his character's ego becomes swept along with disastrous results. But at this stage, his relationship with Carnehan changes from equal partners to one of attempted superiority, and here as well the ability of Huston to so successfully convey this between the two men is seamless and masterful. The chemistry between Connery and Caine is as good as Newman and Redford at their best (Newman was allegedly approached for the role but recommended Caine) and the stunning location work in Morocco is simply beautiful, especially the backdrops when Connery is on his way to see the local high priest. And of course, no review of this picture would be complete without mentioning the one and only movie appearance of Caine's good lady wife Shakira. Despite the well documented story behind Shakira's role, she only has one line to deliver (in fact, actually just one word - 'Roxanne'), and for the record plays Connery's wife, who also famously refers to her (in the script of course) as a slut who has bitten him. That's one for the pub quiz champions of the future.",

            "content": "Michael Caine, Sean Connery, and Christopher Plummer. It's a trifecta of silver-haired British actors before most of them had silver hair. \n\nRudyard Kipling hasn't really aged very well as an author, when some of his best-known stories focus on Westerners going out to exotic foreign lands full of simple-minded peoples with a bit of conquering in mind (this is the author of The White Man's Burden, after all), but The Man Who Would Be King is more a testament to the poet's undeniable skill as a storyteller and the spirit of grand adventure that set the imaginations of young boys on fire. A long-simmering project that director John Huston had been after for decades and commonly considered his last great film, the story pairs Connery and Caine as a pair of semi-retired British army regulars with a penchant for grand journeys, less-than-ironclad morals, and great chemistry in their friendship (the film is as much a buddy comedy as anything else); Plummer bookends the film as a fictionalized version of Kipling himself, listening to the story as it is recounted. The pair make a treacherous journey to Kafiristan, an ancient land with a more primitive way of life, and quickly find that their training and rifles plus a convenient prophecy regarding the return of Alexander the Great offer an opportunity for godhood. It's only bad luck and a bit of greed that can undo the good fortune of the conquerors.\n\nBeautifully shot on-location, the film is a marvel of production design that brings to life all the tropes and assumptions about life in England's interpretation of the exotic Orient - primitive cultures, ancient rites, massive treasures, and busy bazaars. Both Connery and Caine commented that it was their favorite film to produce, and that comes through in their performances - both bubbling with energy and the spirit of discovery, which only makes their ultimate fate all the more tragic, particularly given the exceptional depth given to developing the friendship of these not-so-upright men. The execution really does smooth over problems with the source material, even though the story probably wouldn't be touched by a major studio these days thanks to the broad strokes of the story beats; but that's okay, this version is a perfect look at the material through the eyes of a veteran filmmaker that too many had thought was past his prime.

            "content": "Classic John Huston epic!\n\nJohn Huston's epic adventure-comedy The Man Who Would Be King (1975) is an all timer with a grand scale and intimate dramatic performances. John Huston seems to revisit his Treasure of the Sierra Madre days with this old adventure classic, while clearly influencing Dreamworks for their delightful adventure-comedy musical The Road to El-Dorado beat for beat. \n\nFrom the man who reinvented the film noir genre as well as the adventure genre, The Man Who Would Be King is a splendidly entertaining picture with scores of extras and massive sets. The camels, goats, and mules are outnumbered by all the Moroccan actors in the vast deserts there as Huston filmed a believable odyssey through Afghanistan. I think John Huston's screenplay is brilliant and strikingly adapts Rudyard Kipling's original story, while conveying his parable theme of greed destroying men without morals.\n\nSean Connery is very funny as this stout Scottish conman Daniel Dravot, especially alongside the ever hilarious and engaging Englishman Michael Caine as Peachy Carnehan. Their chemistry has perfect comedic timing and a natural charm. You are so engrossed by their banter and comradery, that you're always in on their devious scheme to rip off an entire nation. You always know and acknowledge that these two lead actors are the villains of the story and the innocent civilians suffer because of them. \n\nChristopher Plummer's stunning portrayal of Rudyard Kipling is neat as he cheerily opens the picture with freemasonry and an intrigued curiosity over Caine's narration. It's Plummer's horrified and astounded face of shock in the end that seals the deal and ensures The Man Who Would Be King is forever an impactful classic.\n\nSaeed Jaffrey is excellent and very funny as the translator Billy Fish, who loyally fights alongside Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Notably, Michael Caine's real life wife Shakira Caine portrays the Afghani beauty Roxanne. She doesn't get much to say, but her character is surely important.\n\nIn conclusion, John Huston directed his massive adventure feature The Man Who Would Be King with a reverence for the sacred and a joy in the irreverent. His good humor and stark morality frames the film with stellar filmmaking, while Connery and Caine delight you.",

Thanks to Rudyard Kipling corresponding to a newspaper he grants them a map to leave and it provides the movie's symbolism.\nOne day they both stumble upon a village in Kafiristan who mistake them for kings. They decide to play along since it's the less-stressful role than what they're normally doing, it's a new land of opportunity so to speak to enjoy the worship, the wealth, the hospitality.\nThey even teach the natives to fight to fend off their enemies but how long can they keep up the illusion? It gets to a point where one of them is believed to be a god before it gets out of hand; certain things to abide by such as not making love to a woman or not accepting any more hospitalities until all enemies are crushed.\nThis is actually a nice buddy adventure movie; two of the best actors of their generation in an exotic part of the world interacting with one another naturally.\nConnery in particular isn't afraid to get down and dirty for this particular war, he reveled playing the occasional anti hero. With this he's a not so bright, morally flawed individual and the conviction he has being a higher authority has a deep voice. He assumes his mantle as one of the great rulers of the past taking the deity role literally. \nHe and Caine bring an amount of amused cynicism with charisma. \nThe characters laugh at the messes they make since nothing else matters.\nBoth these men are under the impression that they can find a kingdom not yet touched by civilization which can be easily taken over.\nThe movie tells the story of bad men held accountable to the indigenous people they encounter, it's not that you hate these two for what they're doing you're actually enjoying their misfortune given their self-ascribed superiority and racist attitudes.\nEverything from power, greed, war, false worship, and manifest destiny of entitled Europeans while lampooning the superiority of British colonialism. \nNo one man can be king, no single government can rule, would you rather follow a god or blind luck?, is the ruling more important than the friendship?\nSome might take the ending as fake feminism considering how it plays out but it's still tragic nonetheless.\nTwo of the classiest actors around strengthen the plot making a wild ride, a simple script that works, you feel the dangerous trek of their journey across the mountain peaks and glaciers, and it shows the gravity of a con of how long it can go for. Some ominous foreshadowing at the beginning too that ties it all back. \nEven individuals like these two can have weaknesses leading to their downfalls but they can still have each other.\nOne of Connery and Caine's finer outings.",

Michael Caine and Sean Connery are charming guys, and their portrayal of these two con artists is endearing despite their conniving personalities. It gets you rooting for them despite the fact that they are constantly taking advantage of the people around them. However, because of their personalities and their track record, I clung onto a false assumption that at some point it would be revealed that the entire story was just deception for Kipling and they were tricking him again. It colored my view of the film a little, but didn\u2019t change how effective it was at showing the adventure of these two men. Also, since I mentioned him, it\u2019s worth pointing out that the amazing Christopher Plummer is also in this film in a minor role as Rudyard Kipling. Of course, he elevates this from being a minor part with his few scenes, and makes me wish he was in the film more. I don\u2019t know if this movie would be as successful without the awesome cast, because they bring a lot to the story. At times I struggled with the motivations in The Man Who Would Be King. It seemed to be such a simple plan, but misguided choices plagued the entire thing. Sean Connery\u2019s character in particular takes an abrupt turn that didn\u2019t fit with the personality they established. If it had been a gradual shift for him then I would understand, but the opportunity to take a massive reward and leave came a bit too early so the decision to stay felt out of place. That doesn\u2019t change how well this film presents the drama, because I was engaged in the story. It didn\u2019t quite hit me on an emotional level, possibly because I was still riding on false assumptions, but I thought it was a good film. It did feel similar to some other films I\u2019ve seen in the past. I assume those would all be copycats, though, since Kipling wrote the story in the late 1800s. The Man Who Would Be King is a solid adventure film, and one that I\u2019d gladly watch again, but with some elements of the ending it was a bit less satisfying than I would like, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll seek it out.",

I find parts of the Indian culture fascinating. Like how raw and chaotic they live in some places. How they can fit an extra hundred group of passengers on the roof of the train when that's so dangerous. Michael Caine's accent is so fucking heavy. God damn. \n\nReally charming to see Michael Caine and Sean Connery together acting like there jokesters. I do have to say, this movie has some jaw dropping locations in India and along the Middle East. Quite a treacherous journey those two went through, but they were prepared. When the preachers passed by right before they were about to fight, that was funny. Pretty crazy how lucky they've gotten with all the predicaments they got themselves into. \n\nWow, he really let the whole being a god/kin thing get to his head. He's ignoring all these signs that are going on around him. Bad things are going to start to happen. It's so chaotic. All the women crying and moaning making weird animalistic noises. In the end they both resorted to committing two sins. One was obsessed with power and the other with greed. In the end, none of them got what they were seeking. That must be so hard to watch your friend dying before your eyes and you can't do anything but just watch. Pretty dark towards the end. Being crucified and all and walking around the desert and mountains with your best friends head in a bag. Christopher Plummer's expression at the end says it all.\n\nThis turned out to be a pretty funny movie. There's a lot of moments in this movie that can be used for sampling in songs, kind of like what Bonobo did.

On a thoroughly unpredictable adventure, the duo constantly converts lemon to lemonade as they meander from a publisher's office in India to a fictional holy land in the desert. There, intending to conquer a few villages and live the high life, the stakes suddenly spike as they find themselves anointed saviors, kings and (eventually) gods. Connery and Caine, good friends away from the screen, bubble with chemistry throughout. Their relationship is essential, and that obvious bond lifts an already-ambitious screenplay into something greater than the sum of its parts. When viewed with contemporary eyes, the pace is a little slow, akin to similar films of the era, but that deliberate tempo reaps unique rewards. By lingering in the atmosphere and dutifully setting the stage, director John Huston expertly depicts the vast cultural differences between our conniving, almost-modern Brits and the ancient ways of life still at play in turn-of-the-century Asia. A fine example of old-style filmmaking, loaded with snappy humor, surprising plot turns, high stakes and creeping peril.",

But when John Huston gets his hands on something, it will be impressive. However, I won't fawn over this film like the critics have. This epic is more haunting (at its best) and near ridiculous, in most respects, than memorable and moving. It is wrapped nicely though with grand sets, hundreds if not thousands of extras, and everything needed for an adventure; war, treasure, an ancient city, and two bumbling comics with a talent for disruption on a national scale. While I don't consider this a masterpiece, I wanted to watch it because where else do you get to see Michael Caine and Sean Connery fumbling around with swords, costumes, and conquest. I think Huston saw the potential for the grandeur of Kipling's tale but for me, 40 years after its release, there's not much in it that leaves an impression. It isn't a film for modern audiences but a more patient one. It has humor but it also suffers from implausibility and at the end of the day, who cares what happens in this superstitious remote part of the world. Hate to say it, but indifference is what happened. Reflecting, I do see pride becomes the villain and reconciliation is only possible after the truth is set free. While a solid adaptation, it isn't up there with my favorite epics but actually closer to the bottom half of large scale extravaganza that doesn't really leave you with anything.",

It's not really an in depth movie, but more just fun and full of colours (as many people would coin this as \"escapist\" which is truthfully a term I don't like using because it sounds derogatory). Connery and Caine, who I believe are friends in life, work very well together, and the scenery footage is incredible.

Not since \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) had an entry in the de facto genre of British Empire Adventure been so well-shot, well-acted, and well-written.  The story is straightforward, at times even predictable, but this is not the same as being simplistic or unedifying.  It is a morality tale, and the moral is... there are perhaps different morals to glean from it, depending on which point of view you take.  There is the viewpoint of Michael Caine's Peachy, a con man with a seemingly nihilistic view of life who would, however, never abandon a friend or break a contract.  There is Sean Connery's Danny, brave and fair-minded but with perhaps more ambition than sense.  And there is Rudyard Kipling himself, played by Plummer behind mustache and makeup that make him a near dead-ringer for the writer, who is envisioned here as a level-headed observer of spectacular people, events, and places who knows how not to go too far.  The joy of the tale is in seeing these personalities play out the inevitable outcome of a mad trek into the Asian hinterland, and then pondering the political, religious, cultural, and historical messages that have been artfully and entertainingly conveyed.",

Despite their amorality, the pair are quite charming and it is fun to watch them succeed, especially since we are not witnesses to the harm their actions will cause. There's even a strange nobility in their arrogance. The film makes a very clever decision here to have us see the pride and wonder of the British Empire before taking us on a tour of its dark side.

            "content": "Usually, I would consider a title like that to be pretty cool, but really, it kind of diluted my interest in the film, because it doesn't really seem all that well thought-out. I can see the book's author, Rudyard Kipling, sitting around, trying to think of a title he finally thinks to himself, \"Hm, let's see, it's a period piece about a man... who would be king; oh, pip-pip cheerio and all that crumpet, I do believe I've got it!\" I think that it's safe to presume that he said something along those stereotypical lines, because the film alone is British as all get-out. Granted, it's directed by an American, but it's John Huston, and he was hardly shy of flaunting his English roots, so you better believe that this film is British something fierce, as if the cast wasn't enough evidence, because we're talking about Sean Connery, Michael Caine, as well as, of course, Christopher Plummer as Kipling himself. Yeah, Chris Plummer wishes he was British, and thank goodness for that, because in order to be more like the Brits, he learned to pull off flawless faux accents, and that's amazing when you consider that he's an Ameri-oh, wait, he's Canadian, so nevermind. A lot of Canadians have a flat accent, much like Americans, and yet, everyone from an accented country seems to forget that and only call out Americans as the people who can't usually do other accents well, though that might just be because Canada's got Chris Plummer on its side, and he makes for a pretty strong argument, because he managed to pull off Rudyard Kipling, and that's pretty darn English, as made clear by much of his work, including this film's source material. Hey, say what you will about the, well, still admittedly pretty cool title, but I'm betting that short story sure made for a good read, though the film, on the other hand, while reasonably worth watching, isn't exactly all that consistently thrilling of adventure film.\r\n\r\nThe earlier acts of the film are limp something fierce, dragging along with a dry atmosphere and even a considerable bit of quietness that taints the film with a degree of dullness, the sting of which goes worsened by the simple fact that very little happens in that first act. The film fails to open terribly strong and just kind of limps out, but just when you succumb and fear that the film will descend to underwhelmingness, the film, well, just enters second act, and that's about it. The film perhaps picks up at the body, though if it does, then it really doesn't pick up all that much, dismissing enough limpness to keep from getting dull, yet sustaining much of the limpness that tainted the first act and plagues most of this final product. Little happens throughout long periods of this film, and after a while, it's easy to become disengaged, as the film's breaking from its consistently dry and somewhat bland tone is an event that doesn't occur as often as it should, and such tonal consistency is not only problematic because there's not much bite to the tone to begin with, but because the film's running a mostly straight line of tone leaves narrative structure to take damage the film to not always pick up when it should. Now, the film never falls too far when it limps out and isn't likely to at some point along the way, as the film does, in fact, pick up slowly but surely, until by the final act, we're facing an actually genuinely good film, yet that's too little too late, as the remainder of the film fails to hit as hard as it should have, because John Huston fails to do that could have saved this film from underwhelmingness: provide enough depth. This film is definately an adventure piece, and after a while, it becomes something of an epic, though that's almost all in concept, as Huston's directorial execution doesn't quite provide enough tonal sweep or depth to really milk this film for all its worth, and with Huston instead further diluting intrigue through slowness and limited tonal dynamicity, the final product comes out not quite what it should have been. However, what ultimately emerges is nevertheless an enjoyable film that may not be able to consistently sustain your attention, let alone full investment, but provides enough of what you want to get you by, particularly if you're looking for a production fit for the epic that this film should have been more like.\r\n\r\nThe film is not exactly heavily produced, though its production value remains reasonably hefty in quantity, as well as fairly impressive in quality, reconstructing this time period with grand yet delicate authenticity, while keeping dynamic in design concepts for you to feel the progression of this adventure, maybe even to the point of feeling some of the epic sweep that John Huston needed to deliver more of. What certainly provides a degree of epic sweep is Oswald Morris' photography, which has dated in several areas, yet remains grand and lively with a broad scope that captures this environment and brings it to life, particularly during the scarce yet worthwhile battle sequences. The film is certainly impressive on a technical level, and while those technical values have dated to a certain extent, they carry this film quite a long ways, while the man who keeps this film going the rest of the way is Rudyard Kipling, who really has crafted a fascinating and lively story that I'm sure must make for a pretty good read, as it does make for a pretty good concept for this film. John Huston's and Gladys Hill's execution of the concept, however, doesn't entirely do it justice, yet neither does it betray the concept entirely, as Huston and Hill do provide a screenplay that is flawed, yet generally well-structured, with some snappy dialogue, lively set pieces and charming characterization, and with his directorial execution, Huston makes many missteps, yet still does an adequate job for the story to charm, while the lead performers fire on all cylinders when it comes to delivering on charm. Sure, Christopher Plummer charms as the legendary Rudyard Kipling during the few times he's present, but this is Sean Connery's and Michael Caine's show, and you better believe that our legeneray charmers of British leads let you know for sure that this is literally Sean Connery's and Michael Caine's show, because they are playing themselves, as they always do, which is just the way I like it. Connery and Caine deliver on distinct, firecracker charisma that defines the Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan characters as, well, Connery and Caine, respectively, but also as down-to-earth, yet still strong and unique enough for them to be bought as people who would find themselves in such grand situations as the ones portrayed in this interesting story. Connery and Caine charm by their own rights, and as a duo, they're sensational, boasting electric chemistry that defines the definitive comradery between our two leads and does the most in carrying this film, something that I wish had more than just the charm of its leads, worthiness of its source material, quality of its technical value and inspired occasions in writing and direction to keep it going, yet is still nevertheless kept going enough for you to walk away, maybe not terribly satisfied, but still with more reasonably fond memories than disappointments.\r\n\r\nBottom line, the film has its occasions of being dull, yet is consistent in being rather bland, as it is slowly, if not limply told, with limited tonal dynamicity, overlong periods of filler and, worst of all, not enough depth or sweep to sustain your complete attention, let alone full investment, thus leaving this final product to fall from its throne of potential satisfaction, yet never fall too far from grace, boasting clever production designs and sweeping photography, as well as a strong story concept that is generally well-structured by John Huston's and Gladys Hill's screenplay, as well as occasionally well-executed by John Huston's direction, but mostly brought to life by the sparkling charisma and chemistry between leads Sean Connery and Michael Caine, who do the most in making \"The Man Who Would Be King\" an enjoyable adventure opus that's reasonably worth sticking with.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

            "content": "This is an old-school Hollywood epic with two trickster lead characters; it's halfway between a buddy comedy and Lawrence of Arabia. It's a fairly faithful adaptation of the Rudyard Kipling story, though I think it's a bit lighter in tone than the story. More than anything though, it's a good opportunity to watch two of everybody's favorite actors beside each other at a young-ish age.\n\nThe story follows a couple of ne'er-do-well British soldiers (Sean Connery and Michael Caine) in the 19th century who decide to march from India into the unknown lands of Kafiristan and set themselves up as kings, seemingly just for the jolly good fun of it. The main action is framed by one of them telling the story of their adventures to a journalist named Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer).\n\nThe main reason to watch this movie, of course, is to see Sean Connery and Michael Caine travel and bicker and take over a country. This was made in 1975, so Connery was already beyond most of his Bond movies (except for Never Say Never Again, that one that kind of doesn't count), and here he is in his full Scottish-accented, mutton-chopped glory. His performance is quite funny, even if his character is rather morally questionable. The same goes for Caine: his character is more ethical and aware of reality than Connery's, but only slightly. It's really fun to watch these two together. Christopher Plummer is fine as Kipling, but he mostly is just there to witness the other two.\n\nThe movie was directed by the legendary John Huston, and plays like a bigger-budget version of his The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. There are a good number of sweeping vistas and mysterious ancient cities to be seen, which lends it the somewhat Lawrence of Arabia vibe. Some of the big crowd scenes have just an unbelievably large number of extras. This is one of those action movies that was more exciting at the time than it would be for today's jaded audiences, though that's no fault of the movie's. And of course the way the movie treats a couple of white guys taking over a bunch of benighted brown natives is less than politically correct, though the movie doesn't seem 100% uncomplicatedly imperialist. Still, it's a big and likable movie.",
