            "content": "Federico Fellini, the genius of the Italian cinema left his imprint in all the films he directed for all of us to enjoy forever. \"Le Notti di Cabiria\" stands as one of his best because of the character of that invincible woman at the center of the story: Cabiria! Having recently seen the excellent copy that was shown at NY's Film Forum, this is a film that like good wine gets better with age.Fellini was the man whose idea was translated for the screen with his usual collaborators, Tulio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano. Pier Paolo Passolini contributed to some of the dialog. Essentialy, this is a timeless tale of a woman that despite adversity, bad times, and all that is wrong around her, keeps her chin up and never begrudges a thing. In fact, Cabiria, despite of her profession, is a woman with a highly moral character.The film takes us back to another, more innocent era. We are shown a prostitute with a heart of gold who is always cheated by most of the men who comes in contact with her. Cabiria is never resentful, or bitter at the hand life throws her way.One of the best realized sequences of the film involves Cabiria being picked up by a handsome and popular actor, Alberto Lazzari. Alberto is about the only one in the movie that treats Cabiria with any semblance of warmth. Unfortunately, nothing happens between them because Alberto's lover, the gorgeous Jessy, arrives at Alberto's apartment to claim what's hers, leaving Cabiria shut up in a bathroom. If only her friends could see her then! Nobody would believe it!There is not a moment out of place in the film. Of course, Fellini had the incomparable Giulietta Masina playing the leading role. Ms. Masina is just too wonderful for words. She makes us believe she is Cabiria, and that's that, which in itself it's something other actresses try harder, without the same results. Ms. Masina's face reveals all that is going on within Cabiria. Together with all her other creations in other Fellini's films, this is perhaps her own triumph as an actress.Franca Marzi, who plays Cabiria's best friend, is also excellent. Amadeo Nazzari is perfect portraying the matin\u00e9e idol, Alberto Lazzari. This was one of his best appearances in a distinguished career in the Italian cinema. The rest of the cast is wonderful.Fellini's masterpiece is a film that satisfies any time one sees it thanks to his vision and the presence of Giulietta Masina.",

            "content": "I would not argue that there could be better films made before and after Cabiria. Perhaps. But there never will be another \"Nights of Cabiria\" - the last Fellini's film with the linear structure, his third and the most successful collaboration with his actress wife, Giulietta Masina, his immortal love letter to her. Of all his characters, Fellini once said, Cabiria was the only one he was still worried about. Of all the characters, I've seen in the films, Cabiria is the one I often think about - what ever happened to her? Did she survive? Was she able to find love? I've never seen the face so alive, changing its expression every moment. If the face is the soul's mirror, Cabiria's (Masina's) face reflects her every single emotion and how effortlessly she goes from bitter cynicism to wistful yearning, from despair to hope, from tears to smile. While there's life there's hope. As long as Cabiria smiles in the end of this tragicomic masterpiece, there is hope for all of us.",

            "content": "What do I love most about Federico Fellini's wondrous THE NIGHTS OF CABIRIA?I love the opening scenes when Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) is robbed and dumped in the Tiber River, and the bikinied Roman boys jump in to save her, but she is annoyed that they have saved her life because she wants to know what happened to Giorgio, who she thinks ran away because \"he was scared.\" He's the one who had robbed and nearly drowned her.I love the many nocturnal scenes around the Passeggiata Archeologica in Rome where the gargoylish prostitutes, like angelic gargoyle Cabiria herself, are selected by their customers approaching in cars, and the wild and saucy humor that accompanies those scenes, particularly when they deal with one elephantine hooker named \"Bomba Atomica.\"I love the scene at the religious shrine of Divina Amore, where everyone comes to vociferate their desired favors, and Cabiria pleads to be released from her life as a streetwalker, and the old lame man falls at the foot of the altar, unhealed. The intensity of the build-up, the virtuosic camera work, the faces of the pious, are all breathtaking.I love the famed scene in the sleazy theatre where Cabiria, at the hands of an unscrupulous hypnotist, relives a tender and poignant scene from her youth in front of a crowd of louts.I love the scenes in and around Cabiria's Ostia Road hovel, and the little boys who climb giant Jungle Jims and call out her name, and she waves back.I love Cabiria's friend Wanda (Franca Marzi), whom she loves dearly. She is a million times less vulnerable that our heroine and takes Cabiria's rants with gracious generosity.I love the scene of that night Cabiria spends in the luxurious villa of a movie star (Amedeo Nazzari.) She is totally out of her element, doesn't recognize lobster, cuddles a cute puppy as fragile as she is, butts her head against unseen doors.I love the deity-kissed music of Nino Rota, lilting us, as it captures the soul of Fellini's lovely wife, Giulietta/Cabiria. And I love the overwhelming and moving finale, when Cabiria is robbed by water once more, this time by a cruel scammer feigning love and for whom Cabiria was ready to start life anew. She rises from her anguish, and as she follows the road revelers, turns and smiles to us, to ME!\u0085the most eloquent smile in Italian artistic creation since La Gioconda.Smile at us, Cabiria, or are you Giulietta Masina smiling now? Or both of you at once? We truly need that smile.",

It involved me more than at least 99% of other films I've seen, and the main character, Cabiria, is a character to cherish and love forever (of course, we who have seen La Strada are already partly familiar with the character). I've hardly ever cared more about a character, and even after only five minutes into the film, I wanted so desperately to protect her. Giulietta Masina is so masterful in her performance, and Federico Fellini, her husband, is as masterful in his direction. I did not believe that they could match their success with La Strada, but, in fact, they succeeded in surpassing it. Bravo. 10/10. One of the best films ever made, plain and simple.",

            "review_title": "\"Nights\" of Fellini and Masina",
            "content": "A prostitute whose life is a veritable study in the resilience of the human spirit is the subject of `Nights of Cabiria,' directed by Federico Fellini. Giulietta Masina stars as Cabiria, a gentle soul at heart who manages to maintain a positive outlook even in the face of adversity.  Experiences that would leave those of lesser mettle jaded she is seemingly able to ward off and emerge from intact, with a guarded optimism that nevertheless leaves her open to whatever ills life may have in store for her next.  But it is just that optimism and her sense of joy in the simple things that makes her so endearing.  She is proud, for example, of the fact that she owns her own house, hovel though it may be.  Though not one to be easily duped, she is vulnerable to sincere persistence, which has in the past rendered her victim to those who would take advantage of her, which is succinctly established in the opening scene of the film. \tFellini's film is a study of how good may succumb to evil, and yet still triumph in the end (though open to subjective interpretation).  It's something of an examination of endurance; how many times can one be knocked down before finally being unable to stand back up again.  At the same time, however, it's an example of how purity can prevail against even the utmost cruelty.  There is a humanity manifested in Cabiria that somehow gives absolution, not only to her lifestyle, but to those who would willingly do her harm.  And it is in that very same absolution that we find a message of hope and redemption. \tAs Cabiria, the diminutive Masina gives a performance that is nothing less than superlative, filled with nuance and expression.  She has a face and a manner that convey an unbelievable depth of emotion, and Fellini captures every bit of it with his camera to perfection.  It sometimes seems that she is a sprite merely masquerading as a woman; she has a light, almost ethereal presence, though at the same time she exhibits an earthy quality that gives her character such complexity, which removes any semblance of stereotype one may assign to her character as a `lady of the evening.'  It is a heartfelt, memorable portrayal that quite simply should have earned her an Oscar for Best Actress.  Turning in a noteworthy performance, also, is Francois Perier, as Oscar D'Onofrio, the stranger who comes into Cabiria's life with an offer that ultimately seems too good to be true. \tThe supporting cast includes Amedeo Nazzari (Alberto Lazzari), Aldo Silvani (The Hypnotist), Franca Marzi (Wanda), Dorian Gray (Jessy), Mario Passante (Cripple in the `Miracle' sequence), Pina Gualandri (Matilda), Leo Cattozzo (Man with the sack) and Polidor (The Monk).  `Nights of Cabiria' is a film of extraordinary depth that is beautiful as well in it's humanity; Fellini has created images, both visually and emotionally, that are stunning and indelibly realized.  Highlighted by the performance of Giulietta Masina, this is a film that begs to be embraced, one that will stay with you long after the last shadow has passed from the screen into darkness.  In Cabiria, Fellini somehow touches something eternal, for there is a lasting sense of innate goodness about her that simply cannot be forgotten.  For seekers after wisdom and truth, this is definitely a film that must not be missed. I rate this one 10/10.",

            "content": "Gorgeous early Fellini, often considered the mid-point in his career, between the more obviously reflective, supposedly realistic early work, and the bleak extravaganzas that followed.  But Fellini was never a neo-realist in the dull way Rossellini was: his use of landscape was always heavily symbolic or subjective.  Here Cabiria lives in the middle of a bleak wasteland, which perhaps serves to figure the emptiness of her life, the sterility of life for women in macho Italy, or a comment on post-fascist Italy itself.It doesn't really matter.  The sentiments of the film are actually quite trite - women are treated badly in Italy, etc.  What's riveting and astonishing is not the experiences of Everywoman, but the experiences of one particular woman.  Although there is a great variety of locales, and Cabiria seems to be always moving forward, the film is actually a melodrama. Cabiria never escapes, whatever her adventures, wherever she goes, she always ends up where she started, at home.  Even when she finally sells her home for a supposed new life, her last (in the film; we just know the circle will never be broken) mirrors her first in a depressing circularity.Yet the film, for all its melancholy, is anything but depressing.  Fellini is most famous for being an indulger of frail male egos, but CABIRIA's strength lies in its imaginative sympathy with its heroine.  The film's structure mirrors her situation - the film has no plot as such, just an accumulative series of self-contained episodes which follow the same pattern: escape, hope, betrayal.  In each episode, the further Cabiria moves away form her 'neo-realist' base, the more dream-like (verging on the fantastic) the film becomes, as if she is stepping into an enchanted world (this is made literal when she follows the actor into the nightclub, like some mythic warrior entering the dragon's lair).  And each time she gives into the dream world, the illusion is rudely shattered -  the scene at the hypnotist's is as heartbreaking as anything in CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT.  So while the reality/illusion dichotomy is facile as an idea, it is extraordinarily powerful as cinema experienced through character.Fellini's filming is as beautiful as anything in 50s cinema, that decade mirabilis: more restrained and grounded than later, with less obvious flourish, but the mixture of realism and dream is made all the more convincing with the gentle, coaxing camera movements, beguiling us as well as the heroine, but with the strange editing, and sometimes disruptive composition giving us a distance she can never have.Giuletta Masina gives the most sublime performance by an actress in Italian cinema- an exuberant mixture of hope and resignation; her gorgeous big eyes not quite ready to give up yet, even at the end, although the submitting to the youthful racket seems as hopelessly bleak as 8 1/2.  Her seemingly unprepossessing body is actually an instrument of unparalelled grace, and the comparisons with Chaplin are not unwarranted - when you see this performance you'll realise how unexpressive most actors' bodies are.The Chaplin model is not always helpful - there is a mawkishness and emotional manipulation towards the climax that almost grates, but by then you so adore Cabiria, and so hate everybody else that thought doesn't really come into it (although doesn't it seem that many male viewers seem to prefer her as helpless).  Throw in a lovely, playful Nino Rota score and you're in movie heaven.",

            "content": "...alongside La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2 and Amarcord. Fellini's films are not for everybody perhaps, but I admire them how well made made and directed they are, some of them like Amarcord and the peacock in the snow have breathtakingly beautiful images that stay long in the mind, for his choices in composers and actors, for his deliberately paced and sometimes ambitious stories(8 1/2 is especially true of this) and also that the characters are not always what they seem at first glance. Nights of Cabiria I have seen before criticised as grating, sentimental and self-indulgent(the latter being a criticism of Fellini's films in general and him also actually), and while I am understanding, I personally don't agree.I find Nights of Cabiria to be one of his accessible films, and along with La Strada also his most moving. Again it is incredibly well made, with beautiful scenery and cinematography. The images are again very memorable, and done with much emotional resonance, the best of which being the ending which is both tragic and uplifting. Fellini's direction is superb, the personal nostalgia that is apparent in all his films is here and you do identify with the story and the titular character. The music has much beauty and nostalgic charm, while the story perfectly tells of the sheer happiness and then tearful sorrow of unfortunate Cabiria's life. Cabiria, the titular character, is one you can identify with immediately, feeling pity and also her conflicting emotions as she tries to remain positive even in the face of adversity. Giulietta Masina gives a bravura performance, her face and eyes are beautifully expressive and she is just heart-breaking. Francois Perier also shines as the stranger who makes the offer that is almost too good to be true.Overall, a truly beautiful film and one of Fellini's best, certainly one of my favourites as well. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

She's rough, vulgar, not very attractive, a showoff, loud, proud, inelegant. I just didn't feel anything for her character at the beginning. But Fellini must have been reading my mind. He purposefully played it that way to draw the viewer in.The streets of Rome are unforgiving and harsh for a prostitute. There are those who sleep in caves and in the archways. Cabiria braggingly says, \"I've got my own house...here's one girl who's never slept under the arches. Well, maybe once. Twice maybe.\" By the end of the film I was completely hooked by her charm, desire, and hope. For hope is what keeps Cabiria going. A great film.",

It's not just the amazing perfomance by Giullietta Masina, it's not just the wonderful, semi-crazy characters wondering around the screen and emphasizing Kabiria's sad and lonely world, it's -and that's the film's greatest quality- this sense of optimism that Fellini wants the viewer to take with him/her as he/she is leaving the theater. The master takes everything from his heroin but at the end he wants to convey one simple, eassy-to-grip but so essential message: \"Please, don't give up\". The power of the film's last ten minutes is unpreceded in the world of movies and, sad to say, never again have we seen such an amazing finale. This is a must-see film, and, most important of all, a film so generous to its viewers that one time is not enough. A total 9/10",

Her emotional journey allows us to understand why and how she retains hope during this whole time, yet the theme of a \"hooker with a heart of gold\" was overdone in this film (especially during the church sequence) and the betrayals felt too repetitive.",

Fellini and his amazing muse, Giulietta Masina, created one of those rare movie masterpieces in 1957 that comments on its time, yet remains fresh and contemporary as well.

But if I had to pick just one title, it would be Nights of Cabiria. I saw it when it first came out in this country--I was a junior in high school and fortunate enough to live near a theater that showed foreign films.  It ran for several weeks and I kept going back to see it over and over, giving myself permission by dragging friends to see it.  No one was ever disappointed, though only a couple of friends developed a comparable enthusiasm with mine. I have continued to seeit every chance I get, though I have not had the opportunity to see the latest reissue--I probably will have to see it onvideo or dvd, since the city I now live in rarely shows any foreign films.

            "content": "Like Maria Falconetti in \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\", Meryl Streep in \"Sophie's Choice\" or Gena Rowlands in \"A Woman Under the Influence\", Guiletta Masina in \"Nights of Cabiria\" displayed, with a poignant authenticity, the courage to overcome the adversity underlining her vulnerable condition.Coincidentally, like Gena Rowlands with John Cassavettes, Masina was directed by her husband, Federico Fellini. And I believe this is the key of intimacy that liberates the actress in front of the camera and allows her to express every single emotion with intensity, and no fear of being over-the-top, the man behind the camera takes care of everything. And \"Intense\" to describe Guiletta Masina's performance is an understatement, so is the very word \"performance\". Masina lives Cabiria, with an endearing generosity and universal appeal. Rarely have I felt so much empathy toward a character who happens to be a loud-mouth thirty something prostitute.Cabiria is introduced as a joyful woman living a passionate romance with Giorgio, she kisses him, embraces him, then he suddenly steals her purse and pushes her into the river, where she nearly drowns before being saved by a group of young men. The opening scene is intriguing by its setting, an industrial area far away from the city, and the broad daylight, and its cheerful tone followed by a tragic twist, then an optimistic resolution. Basically, after a first viewing, you simply realize how the first minutes, in their tragicomic aspect; represent the movie in microcosm. But the emotional trap not to fall in is to consider Cabiria as a pathetic woman on which bad luck keep going on, Fellini's film is the chronicles of a series of misfortunes punctuated with optimistic statements about human nature, and it's up to the viewer, to Cabiria, to see the half-filled or half-empty glass.Cabiria's surprisingly ungrateful reaction after she's rescued is another indication of her unique temperament. She trusts any bad intentioned smooth-talking Don Juan over any genuinely caring person. In the following scene, her best friend Wanda seems very concerned and friendly before being harshly dismissed. Cabiria has the sweetness and the temper of a child, and her tragedy is that she never displays the right reactions at the right time, making the general mood of the film fascinatingly unpredictable. Cabiria never misses an occasion to dance, with her unique charisma; she steals the show and creates an eccentric cheerful mood even inside the prostitute's circle. Her positive attitude is a personal way to rise herself above her condition. As she likes to remind everyone: she owns her house. She has an almost childish way to brag about the fact that she's not like any prostitute. Indeed, we never see her in activity, she embodies the condition of being a prostitute, disdained, insulted, taken advantage of, and her eternal suspicious attitude toward any sign of kindness is an unfortunate professional bias. Both tragic and comic, Cabiria reminded me of two classic movies notorious for having inspired Fellini.Cabiria's appearance is almost comical, she's short but doesn't embarrass herself with high heels, instead she has these white socks worn with very unlikely sandals, and eyebrows a la Mickey Mouse. During the Mambo part, every eyes stare at her. She dances and moves a bit like Chaplin in \"Modern Times\", Cabiria is a sort of female clown with the right mix of pathos and burlesque, the Tramp with the umbrella as cane-like accessory. And when she gets in the beautiful house of the rich movie star, and he starts developing a fondness on her, we expect a disillusion to come, like the Tramp with the Rich Man in \"City lights\". Mickey Mouse or Charlie Chaplin, Cabiria is the female incarnation of the universally appealing figure of \"little fellow who does his best\" in a quite hostile world. The music of Nino Rota embodies the playful mood of Cabiria's misadventures until the sense of urgency in her quest of a new life started to remind of another masterpiece: De Sica's \"Bicycle Thieves\". Like the new bicycle changed Ricci's life, a new love would transform Cabiria, and the desperation growing deeper and stronger as indicated in that scene where she joins the pilgrims and asks the Virgin Mary to change her life, was a powerful reminiscence of Ricci visiting the Wise Woman.This is the dilemma that inhabits \"Nights of Cabiria\", romantic or realistic. When after having been so mistreated during a magic show Cabiria was approached by the kind accountant Oscar, played by Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier, I wanted her to keep her guard up. And as he seemed genuinely in love, convincing her after several meetings, to marry him, and leave everything for him, my heart pounded as I was expecting the worst to happen. And then came the climactic scene in the cliff when Cabiria understood Oscar's dark motives, just like Giorgio's, and she started sobbing, my heart literally melted. Cabiria is the quintessential romantic person, in the denial of the world's reality, and the pain in her heart, was her realization that the vision she always tries to reject was true. But she pulled herself together, started walking when a group of happy young people dancing and playing music formed a cheerful parade around her. This was the \"City Lights\"-like ending the movie needed: the ultimate triumph of the faith in human spirit. Cabiria is like reborn in this scene, her eyebrows are natural, her smile genuine, her wounds healed, as she feels in security again, hence her quick glance at Fellini, behind the camera, or was she simply thanking us, viewers, for loving her?Kabir' means 'big' or 'powerful' in Arabic, and I wouldn't be surprised, if the name was a derivation from that Semitic epithet. Cabiria is a character defined by a personality that transcends the limits of her tiny little body. Size-wise, she's everything but Cabiria, street-wise, she has one hell of a big mouth and as a human being, her heart is simply gigantic",

            "content": "Night of Cabiria (1957) **** (out of 4) Oscar-winning drama of prostitute Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) who has very little in this world except for her dream of finding someone who really loves her. It seems each time someone serious takes an interest in her, it's for some reason other than true love. I still haven't seen too many Fellini movies in my life but the ones I have seen have left me rather cold even though I was highly impressed with the talent shown in them. I was really looking forward to this one and as it would turn out this here is my favorite that I've seen from the director so far. I read quite a few reviews before watching this and each of them seemed to have a different opinion on the film. Some called it a chic flick. Some called it a black comedy. Some called it a depressing nightmare. The one thing I agreed most with was a critic who compared it to a female version of Chaplin's Little Tramp character. I think what works so well about the film is that it contains a little bit of everything and all of these emotions are perfectly pulled off by Masina who turns in a masterful performance and really makes this character one of the most memorable female roles in film history. I think she perfectly nails the darker side of the comedy in scenes like the beginning when she returns home after her \"true love\" trying to drown her by pushing her in the lake. The scene with her on the bed is so sad it's hilarious. I think she also does a great job in terms of being a woman simply wanting love. The innocence of this dream really comes across as something very touching and something we want her to find. Then, there are the darker moments that I won't ruin but she again nails these perfectly. There have been countless films with women playing prostitutes and quite often people joke that this is the type of role any actress would want to play and I can't help but wonder if that feeling started here. I guess it goes without saying that Masina was overlooked at the Oscars this year. Fellini's touch is also on hand and I thought that for the most part he kept the film moving very well, although I didn't care too much for the scene that was added to prints in 1998 with the mysterious man delivering the blankets. Outside of this scene the director handles the various emotions quite well and the beautiful photography really jumps out at one.",

            "content": "I think there's just two reasons to make make this film the most beautiful thing I've ever seen on screen. I have yet to see a more beautiful movie. I'll explain below.The first is the play of emotions. At first Cabiria is upset after falling in the water. Then she smiles and laughs. Then she's upset. This transformation of emotions makes you throughout the movie want to see her smile. And when she laughs you're in heaven. With her. This is one reason: transformation of emotions, and your wish for Cabiria to get to laugh.The second thing that moved me with all my emotions was her reaction to sufferance. In her life she suffered before the movie (bad parents, prostitution, social status, poverty), throughout the movie (although her way of living rarely show you her sufferance in the movie, you feel she's very happy), and probably after the movie ends (again, bad future most likely). At the final part of the movie the pain is excruciating. She loses everything that connects her to the life (all her money & house), love (lover), social status (marriage) and some hope (in life and Virgin Mary). This is all in one scene. Actually, all she has left are her friends and possibly a suitcase. And then it happens: she's happy. In the very final part her reaction is: she yells, while crying, to the rubbing lover to kill her. She repeats this. And the final scene is a victory on life. Sure, her life was, is (oh, boy, what must her feelings be right now) and will be filled with pain. But he takes this reality, a certain fact, nothing's more concrete than this, and twists it: she's happy. In a face of tears, after a horrifying painful experience, she looks at the unsuspecting people around her that are joyful, happy, friendly, and takes their feeling: she smiles, almost laughing. There is no reality. The sufferance is beaten. Life has no hard touch on her. This is much more than hope. She is not wishing for a better future. She's living it now. Life is transformed with her final joy.I have yet to see a better movie. It's the one movie for which: I registered on IMDb, I voted, I read all the comments, I wrote this comment. No second place. My current top movies: this movie and below this everything else. There's not another movie I would recommend to anyone older than 15.",

            "content": "Federico Fellini's tale about a prostitute named Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) is a tale about trying to escape your own life, which has become unbearable. Cabiria works as a prostitute, and she's not had the best of luck when it comes to men, or anything for that matter. The film is a collection of scenes with her as she tries just about everything to break the mold. She tries anger and shouting. She tries friendship. She tries religion. Just about everything. But it all seems to circle around, over and over again.Masina is very good in her role. Her Cabiria is a vulnerable little thing, whose bark is just about everything she has. Even when she's acting tough, because there's really nothing else to do, you can see that she's one step away from crying. And that makes her sympathetic.The film is also shot well, as expected from a director as renowned as Fellini. The locations are interesting, the camera moves well and the scenes are constructed nicely.Yet I can't really claim that I liked the film. And that's because the film is frankly speaking depressing. Cabiria is a writhing ball of misery, all the people around her are either indifferent or using her for their own gains, and whenever there seems to be hope in sight, it turns out to be false. Sure, that's very much intentional, but it still means that you leave the film feeling downtrodden. And the film offers nothing in return. It simply wants to show you that this exists.",

            "review_title": "Fellini's humanness",
            "content": "Le Notti is a very rich,thematically, and diversified movie:the freshness and the concreteness,a strange inebriate detachment (in the \"Alberto\" the movie star episode),men's wickedness,the horrible baseness,the sordidness,the suavity,the gentleness and the bitterness,the irreverence towards the Christianity,also themes from previous (Il Bidone,La Strada) and even future (La Dolce vita,Toby Dammit,the easy-going eccentric Roman inebriate night life,Rome's night life) films.Fellini no longer believes in,or no longer practices the Shakespearian notes he used in Il Bidone,that kind of Shakespearean intensity.Anyway,like \"Il Bidone\",\"Le Notti\" changes register in its last part,and offers that unsparing insight deeper than the reality itself.Transitional movie,\"Le Notti\" is at once a recapitulation of themes from previous works,and a preparation for his future essays (the 4 great movies from the '60s).The epic texture is still important.I don't think that Fellini ever bets on the \"social document\",etc.,and his ephemeral,or,at least,temporary association with some Neorealists in the '50s is generally misunderstood and made to mean something it never was.A thin-skinned prostitute,\"Cabiria\",meets a bashful accountant.Seen through Cabiria's experiences,her tribulations,the things she sees, tell more about her own mind,she is not,as such,the director's representative,though Fellini depicts reproachfully the malice of some of those met by Cabiria in her way.The world as presented in \"Le Notti ...\" is,at least partially,seen through the prostitute's eyes,hence the touch of grotesque and even some kind of a twisted naivet\u00e9,a la Sue.In this world seen by Cabiria,there are some landmarks of concrete humanity,e.g. the philanthropist met by the prostitute,or the Friar.It is always surprising,but also heartening, to see a man of great intelligence needing to give goodness and humanity a place in his work.(Kusturica,who refused any resemblance with Fellini and denied any influence,uses the same kind of endowing the sleazy worlds he explores with at least one firm landmark of goodness,so this world it is not left to its own degeneration and cowardice.)I see in this lapidary insert that never patronizes the sign of a distinguished deftness.(In \"Il Bidone\" such a character misses.)Albeit mixed with irony and sarcasm (those of an exceptional mind ),Fellini's compassion is none the less authentic.His relative neutrality,his neatness in handing this humble epic stuff do not make him an indifferent witness.(As a youngster,Fellini planned to make a movie about a \"little wildflower of grace\", Serenella ;more interesting is to note that this \"little wildflower of grace\" was,for Fellini,one of \"the two faces of the Church\".Fellini had opinions,had ideas about real life,goodness,etc..Fellini even had a very keen and salubrious idea about the true task of Christianity for man,to \"restore him to his divine greatness\".)He was also known to admire humility, simplicity,and he knew to be politically incorrect in this.\"Le Notti\" may be Fellini funniest movie:it abounds in comical things,and this comic is always tasteful and intelligent.It also has a certain quality that can be simply described as gentlemanly.Also,let us note that in \"Le Notti\" Fellini avoided the cruelty's altitude reached already in \"Il Bidone\",but maintains a more comical and grotesque register.In \"Le Notti ...\" Fellini still has a narrative thread;he gives shape to various intuitions,feelings, perceptions,dreams,in an impressionistic and fancy but well-conceived and finely molded way.His enjoyment of the clownish aspects of the reality is a relish.Cabiria's world is explored with Fellini's appetite for the concrete.He connives with the prostitutes and the hussies,sends Cabiria in the medium of the rich,in that of the religious pilgrimages....There are some powerful vignettes,displaying Fellini's gusto and skills for seizing various facets of the social life.His mastership in depicting realist scenes that none the less have a bizarre and ambiguous twist is obvious in Cabiria's tribulations.With the air of making a purely reflexive and intransitive work,Fellini still expresses freely,with an Un-faked ingenuity, his thoughts about life,people,etc..While affecting to leave outside his feelings and opinions about everyday life and the common experience,Fellini none the less slipped his own thoughts and reactions,because he did have them and was not sank into some kind of impassibility,placidity and indifference.Fellini's ironic detachment,caustic sometimes,was,in his '50s movies,a good way to perceive the reality and to depict it without being patronizing or Thesist.The man was very refined and subtle and he refused to be encapsulated,enclosed,encompassed in an artistic formula;he believed in the richness and irreducible character of both life and art.This playful man wasn't a joker.Fellini passed a judgment on certain aspects of life,and resented the cruelty and the wickedness,without ever being didactic or moralist;but it must be said that,as director,he was both very intelligent and ironic,and ingenuous,natural,spontaneous;one,no less than the other.He was as impassible and as ingenuous as his very keen intelligence made him to be.Nobody was farther than Fellini from conforming himself to a theoretical model about how should man be and create.I want to praise \"Cabiria\"'s actors' genuineness,beginning with Mrs. Masina;this was her fifth movie with her husband.She was ever more than a \"Fellini actress\".Her ethereal and funny approach denotes a very mature understanding.(But it is true that Fellini wanted for his movies real actors, great actors,not puppets,he favored the creative skills of the actors.) Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier's performance is simply gold;it has that sensitivity,delicacy,nuances and fineness that are compelling.\"Cabiria\" is on the iridescent side of Fellini's '50s career,the other side being the \"realist\" and narrative one.This iridescent side is irreducible to schools and trends,expressing Fellini's refusal to use the standard methods and to work within a common code,and favoring,at first through this poetry of the Faubourg,the experimental and a new Apprehensibility.It is important to notice that Fellini was a great experimenter,and one that never cogs;he is probably the most famed cinema experimenter.( \"I have one great limitation\",said Fellini,\"not having general ideas about anything\".)Fellini agreed,once,that \"all my films revolve around \" the \"love toward one's neighbor\".Those who are used to receive this only in a conventional,didactic way,won't even recognize it in Fellini's works.Averty did the best homage to Fellini,considering him one of the three directors that never made a bad movie,and unable to make one.I subscribe.",

Poor Giulietta Masina, one of the greatest film actresses of all time, she always gets the short end of the stick and because the movie magic is so intense, our heart breaks right along with her.Fellini is the Great Director Italian style. I don't mean he isn't the greatest director, better than Hitchcock, Welles, a modern like Scorcese. I'm looking at his work, have seen most of them, and I can't make up my mind. He might be the greatest that ever lived. His films in black and white, the Neo-Realism of Italian film after the war, the incredible original vision, the writing, and directing, it's as though Michelangelo came back as a director.Masina is a prostitute, but her loves turn out to be pocketbook grabbers. Her physical well being is not high on her boyfriend's priority list. She's such a little women, frail, and in Nights she plays a tough, brawling, whimsical, and hopeless romantic. Her acting style is over the top, almost carnival character as she had played it in La Strada, but as Cabiria, she's older, but not necessarily wiser. The final revelation with French actor Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier is so heart rendering because after an hour and a half of Cabiria's, laughter, trials, and disappointments, we identify with her completely.

The film carries an episodic storyline that follows our heroine Cabiria as she has to use a hard act of cynicism and street-wise attitude to cover up a girlyish interior. Run-ins with a celebritie and other louse-abouts, a visit to a church, and a life-changing bit on a magician's stage, and most of these sequences are filmed superbly. Not only is there Fellini's usual under-current of laughs, but a perfect sense of imagination behind the on-location sets and real-life actors.I've seen this and La Strada now (Masina's other notable work), and I feel a little more inclined to go with this one as the better. Some critics have written that Fellini's films, in the evolution of his career, show a gaining momentum up till 8 1/2. Although I'd have to see both each a second go-around, Nights of Cabiria had me enthralled and amazed for the whole two hours. There's something so appealing about a character like Cabiria that's pulled off without a hitch, even into the seemingly 'easy' third act. Add another fantastic Nina Rota score, fascinating supporting cast, and a genuine ideology behind the environment of Cabiria's world, and it's a winner. This is the kind of film that COULD have appealed more so to women than men, but as it stands, the film holds up as a great romantic character study for anyone. A+",

The main character stays always optimistic despite her harsh life, which makes her in a sense a feminine copy of De Sica's \"Umberto D\".\nMassina plays a prostitute named Cabiria, who lives in the outskirts of Rome. She is full of vitality and is a free spirit, but at the same time naive: love blinds her. Her lovers are after her only for the money she has, and this deeply affects her, though she always tries to fight for a better life.\nThis films starts off fairly well, but then (as I've noticed in other Fellini works) becomes increasingly tedious. His films usually have 2 or 3 great scenes, but then again the rest leaves me cold. I also loathed the moralistic, preachy tone this movie has, which makes it quite schematic and unrealistic.",

In particular, I did not like LA STRADA the first time, but now think it is a wonderful film and his earlier \"forgotten\" films are exceptional. My particular favorite of all his films is the segment he did for BOCCACCIO 70--it was very surreal and hilarious. However, despite my increased appreciation, I STILL don't particularly like Le NOTTI di CABIRIA--though I liked it a little more the second time because at least I could see that it was technically well-made. However, the story itself of a prostitute who wants to be loved and cared for is unrelentingly awful and depressing--so much so that I never want to see it again. Part of this might be because I am more a romantic at heart and part of it is that I just feel the film is wildly overrated. Sure, Giulietta Masina did a fine job--she was a fine actress (as well as Fellini's wife), but this doesn't make the movie. The problem is that the movie is so unrelentingly realistic and grim. Sure, in real life prostitutes don't find love and are often abused--but do I really have to see this movie to know this?! The film starts with Masina getting beaten up and nearly killed by her \"boyfriend\" and the film ends much the same way. Everything else in between is leading us to believe that this inevitable ending might not occur, but it does. Now I am not saying I want a vacuous and insipid film about a prostitute with a heart of gold--after all, my review for PRETTY WOMAN was savage (I truly, truly hated that movie). But other than a grim lesson that life sucks, I really can't see why I would recommend this film. It's good, but not at all pleasant. For people that can stand all the emotional pain, you may like it a lot more than me--I just want something a little more uplifting and likable.",

Watching the movie, I wanted to shout to her to \"watch out!\" and to jump into the screen to take her away from the parasites who wanted to feed on her.  So entranced was I by Masina's performance.  Telling the surface plot is unnecessary here; the film's substance happens between the lines: Cabiria's emotional depth between the devastations, her perpetual longing for better and, despite it all, her indomitable happiness.  It's the story of predators and prey (Cabiria), and it's a picture of the enduring human spirit. Only an actress of transcendent powers could pull off such a task, and Masina manages it beautifully.  Look at the IMDb \"Awards & Nominations\" page for this film: in 1957 Masina won \"Best Actress\" at Cannes; in 1958 the film won the Oscar for \"Best Foreign Language Film;\" and in 1959 the film was nominated for a British Academy Award for \"Best Film From Any Source.\"  Three of the film's magical moments:  1) the \"Hypnotist\" scene.   2) After falling asleep atop a cliff where one of those \"predators\" had taken advantage of her, she awakes and the sea below this cliff is now covered by a misty shroud (you interpret what \"being above the clouds\" means).  And 3) after a final personal devastation, she joins a small troupe of carefree youth in their singing and dancing as they walk the road.  Joining them, her dirt-smudged and tear-swollen face regains its radiance and we feel happy that she's smiling again.  But the real brilliance of this moment - one of the most affecting in all cinema - is when Cabiria glances briefly INTO THE LENS, smiles and nods AT *US* that she will be alright.  Watching this movie that first time I was happy that she was smiling among these young troubadours, but not until she glanced, smiled and nodded directly TO ME did I feel released from my need to rescue and protect her, free to leave the theater and let her go on her own (without me).  Personally, no other actress has ever been able to penetrate so completely to my emotional core. Brilliant director, brilliant actress.  SEE THIS MOVIE.",

And yet the movies conclude quite differently. Cabiria is one of those characters that really get under your skin in the progression of the film - it's a woman who seems difficult to understand at the beginning when she's saved from drowning, yet doesn't even have a word of thanks for her saviours and heads off ranting. What follows is grand character development. Episode by episode we get deeper in Cabiria's heart and mind, her hopes and dreams, see her praying for a miracle, but again and again she fails, is used, ridiculed, ignored. Cabiria is not just a naive girl stumbling into her doom, she rather seeks salvation in simplicity and belief when everything else shatters to pieces. She's actually quite a complex character - emotional, earthy and proud in her own way, yet vulnerable and always on the brink. And we are swept away with her when eventually that turn in her fate is actually happening, the change for which we've all been rooting by then.It all leads up to one of the most striking final scenes in cinema history - Fellini's camera work and Masina's performance invoke pure movie magic: Never before is a greeting from a total stranger as heart-warming as here, never again will a well-timed nod into the camera be so electrifying as Cabiria's. Maybe you already know what I mean. In any case I conclude with: Buona sera!",

            "content": "I've never seen a Federico Fellini movie that I didn't like, and \"Le notti di Cabiria\" is certainly another great one, telling the story of naive but self-standing prostitute Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) wondering through Rome looking for love but never finding it. Whether she gets pushed into the river (and then gets angry when the boys saving her don't know where the man went), or acts out a childhood scene for a hypnotist, or gets involved with a movie star, Cabiria never loses faith in her aim.I thought that the two most effective scenes in the movie were the church and the movie star's house. In the church, there's an invalid hoping to get cured, but it doesn't happen, much like how Cabiria never attains her goal; not even in the seemingly holiest of places can people come across what they seek. In the movie star's house, she has to walk up a staircase to get to his room. The camera angle faces up, making it look as though she is walking up to heaven and can finally get what she wants. But she doesn't, and then walks back down the stairs. They film it from above, so that it looks as though she has to leave this fantasy world that she had entered and come back down to reality. (Note: this is all conjecture, so don't quote me.) All in all, Fellini accomplished another masterpiece here. Part of what's so great about the movie is how he introduces the characters. Not just Cabiria, but also her prostitute friends, and how men pick them up. It's a movie that I recommend to everyone. Even if you're the type who only likes Hollywood movies saturated with mindless action, you at least gotta give this movie a try.",

I don't think so -- I believe this to be Fellini's first film concerned with the nature of what film is: part prostitution, part promised miracle; part mesmerised fantasy; part romantic pretense.And that's how this film is constructed, four set pieces dealing with these four ideas:-- The film actor as reluctant prostitute-- The masses flocking to the madonna based on the magic of the ritual performance-- The audience being hypnotized by watching someone be hypnotized-- The play that is behind love, and all it is, is a play for money (which connects to the small sequence in the beginning)This is definitely worth watching, and it has historical significance as well. But I think it s pretty weak Fellini so far as the visual elements and the narrative adventure. So many of the dramatic metaphors are peculiarly Italian -- somehow they don't translate to the universal as well as say the Japanese of Kurosawa.",

            "content": "\"Le notti di Cabiria\" is a French/Italian co-production from 1957, so this film is already clearly over 60 years old and it is among the more known films by Federico Fellini, who is considered Italy's finest filmmaker of all time by many. I would only say \"more\" and not \"most\" though because the latter probably applies rather to the films he made with Mastroianni. FF and MM. By the way, Fellini also worked on the screenplay here together with many other writers. You can see from the rating here that these 100 minutes are liked, maybe even loved, by many and also back then it received lots of awards recognition, including a Best Foreign Language Feature Film win at the Oscars and a Palme d'Or for lead actress Giulietta Masina. The former is certainly too much, there must be better films from that year, but Masina's win does not make me mad because she was really good in here. You can certainly say that she was the female equivalent to Mastroianni when it came to working with Fellini. Sadly though her films did not make as much of an impact. Or maybe they did back then, but today she is certainly not included in as many talks as is Mastroianni when it comes to Fellini films, maybe also because she was never nominated for an Academy Award. Perhaps a bit undeserving because like I said here she was really good and I will probably watch \"La Strada\" tomorrow and I am certainly curious about her turn there. But now let's take a more detailed look at this one here. There is a clean structure I felt in terms of story-telling here. First we had the scene in which she almost drowns, but surprisingly quickly recovers. Next chapter would be the guy who is an actor apparently. Then we have a brief church sequence before the action moves to a stage performance including hypnosis and finally it is about the man about to marry her.I would like to say a few words on these segments. First thing that came to my mind is really how the longer the film goes, the more tragic it becomes for the protagonist because she desperately wants to be loved (we also know that without the hypnosis scene), but is not just disappointed again and again, but even humiliated. I mean it is obviously bad if you are pushed into the water, but there is hardly anything that tops being taken to a guy's apartment and then the ex-girlfriend from the guy shows up and they have sex while you hide in the room next door. And in the morning the man you thought has feelings for you escorts you quickly outside before the other woman realizes, no matter how much money he gives you that every same moment. The public humiliation by the hypnotist (even if I don't really believe in it) was also pretty sad to watch how they were laughing about her showing everybody her true feelings and color and desperation, especially when they say something like who should want her and after she did not even want to enter the stage initially. And in the end, with the guy who saw her (I don't want to call him Oscar because I somewhat doubt this is his real name, but was just a trick to fake a connection) at said stage show and the two get closer to each other and are about to marry and you wonder how she will be disappointed this time. It was kinda obvious it would happen again. For example I thought when she was waiting for the bus that she was waiting for him and he would not be in it or so. Just me though. Still in the end he may not have had feelings for her and he may have stolen the money, but at least he was not evil enough to kill her, maybe he even started to like her a bit because she is a pretty likable character. Obviously, she is a simple girl, even if sometimes she tries to hide it and the bragging towards the other girls does not feel too cool, but it is just her, she just wants to let people know that she is happy. And I thought she was not that unattractive honestly. Anyway, i kinda felt that if this had been a (later) American movie, Frances McDormand could have played the part pretty well, or I don't know, she was pretty stunning when she was young, maybe too stunning even for the role.Another thing i want to say here is that in terms of style that felt very Fellini, especially the humor and how many characters were really very over the top as they often are in Federico's films, but he keeps getting away with it because it just somehow reflects the dolce vita of it all (no pun intended) and also the music is very dominant here. There are several examples for that as well. take the very final sequence after she is on her own again (and even lower than the really low people she sold her house to) or the circus music we hear before the stage show or the great deal of music at the church (where I only liked the final part with the guy on crutches in the sense of the miracle not happening, but this is not because the saint is not powerful enough, but because he has been too much fo a worm. There are more examples for interesting music inclusions. Frequently, Fellini takes the path that it is just indirectly a soundtrack because the music is actually made there on location. One thing I found pretty shocking was really the (ab)use of pets in this film, birds to be more precise. That poor D'Artagnan (was his name I think) had literally zero space to move in his cage and when she leaves her home for good, she just says bye to the animal and vanishes. Oh my, what was up with that. She cannot be that good of a character, can she? I think she is certainly a bit on the shallow side in general, not just on the simple side. I still wondered why near the end she told Oscar that she does not want to see him again maybe because clearly she did not only want to be loved, but be loved by him. I guess you can come up with explanations that make sense there though. So yeah, as you can see from my title I did not really enjoy this film too much early on and it took almost an hour until it really sucked me in. So the first half was a 2.5 out of 5 maybe and the second half was a 3.5, so overall a solid 6 stars out of 10 for this film, but I cannot agree with the high rating here on imdb or with the great deal of awards attention for this film except for Masina, without whom it probably would have been an even weaker watch. Then again, my opinion is perhaps not completely representative here because I have never been a huge Fellini lover like many others have, even if it impossible to deny his talent and he shows it here too. For example the ending as really challenging when it came to finishing the film on a bit of a high note in the sense of \"life goes on\" and \"hope never ceases to exist\" after all that happened before, even right before. And he masters this challenge. So I am glad I got to watch this for the first time on the big screen and for the first time ever now on the occasion of a little Fellini retrospective for his 100th birthday. I give \"Nights of Cabiria\" a thumbs-up. Go watch it unless you hate old European black-and-white films.",

            "content": "Nights of Cabiria is another neo-realistic Italian cinema that took us down-right to the world of misfortune,despairing,unloved world of a prostitute.The story of a woman Cabiria who dreamed up of finding true love in her life.The story follows Cabiria in her quest for love where she wanders the streets of Rome during night awaiting a wonder to happen when one day she will find the love of her life,but ironically in her quest she always get betrayed,disrespected and used-up by the different men she encounters in her journey.In this tragicomic tale,Giulietta Masina portrayed the role of innocent and naive women which is one of the greatest performance i have seen from any actress in my life.You will gravitate towards her wide,round glittering eyes and her innocent smile.You will grieve for her griefs, felt sympathy for her and when she smile,the innocence and purity of her smile compel you to smile and rejoice for her, when she pray to Madonna in a shrine i felt like praying with her.Her character was so energetic,full of passion ans positive attitude towards life,no matter how much she is in pain and grief she always found a way to laugh.Nights of cabiria is certainly one of the most perfect and equally powerful movie ever made.There is not a single flaw in the direction of Federico Fellini.The movie was more than perfect in every department from plot development,cinematography,performance to editing you cannot point-out a single sign of blemishness in the movie.This movie was entertaining throughout, perfectly paced that allow the audience to get deeply involve with the story and also prevent from boredom.The scenes were shot with precise details, perfection and beauty,whether the scene of the prayer in the shrine or the tension and sadness build at the climax ,every scene was exquisitely brilliant.This movie have one of the most tragic ending i have ever seen.The movie ended like it started,when she get betrayed again by another man she fell in love, in-spite of being sad and severely honest to audience about the harsh reality of world all the time, movie still inspire us at the end same time to never to loose hope. Nights of Cabiria is not a chick flick,this movie has an insight ,the character study of a misfortune women.Just like a mirror,this movie shows us the reality of life,true depiction of the cruel and unaffectionate world we live in but still inspires us.Sometimes,I wonder how can i relate myself so much with a movie that is not even near around to my culture,language,era and the country.Nights of Cabiria is one of those movies.this movie was made in 1957(the year even when my parents were not born) and from the country of Italy,i hardly know anything about it's culture and language.But still love the movies from Italy,the country where one of the most beautiful movies of the world are made.It is because of that these movies have boundless emotions that flows beyond the border of any country,passes all the hurdles of language and time and equally capable to penetrate the emotions of audience,irrespective of it's language and country.The movies like Nights of Cabiria are like Diamond which have no influence of time,only they get more and more beautiful as the time passes.The world will never forget the cinematic gems like this.",

The title character, portrayed by the waif-like Giulietta Masina, wife of director Fellini, has it all and loses it all in the space of an afternoon, and one would think she would have thrown herself off the cliff when the scoundrel Oscar (Francois Perier) left her penniless and with no place else to turn. But then, as she joins the makeshift procession out of the woods, a wistful smile returns to her face, perhaps knowing that she's finally been freed from a life of hopelessness and frustration. It almost doesn't make sense given the way she's left penniless, but there's a tremendous sense of liberation that I felt for Cabiria when she emerged from her experience that day. All throughout the film she managed to persevere and come out of her troubling situations with a certain amount of poise and good cheer. Perhaps her prayers to the Madonna were answered, when she asked for the grace to change her life. Life's good fortune and miracles don't always follow along a straight line path, and as the picture comes to a close, one has a sense that for Cabiria, everything was going to be okay.",

And I must say that this is probably one of my favorite Fellini movies! As basically all Fellini movies, it has a very simple concept and an extremely straightforward storyline. It's simply following its main character around, who is in search of love and happiness. The story is getting told almost like an adventure movie, as the main character visits lots of different places and is meeting a wide variety of characters. The movie is foremost a drama but it also has a strange comedy tone to it, making this still a very entertaining movie to watch as well.The message you can take from it is that you shouldn't desperately search for happiness and then expect to end up getting more happy than you were before. That's a lesson the main character in this movie learns the hard way. But luckily it really isn't a movie that is being preachy in any way. It never tries too hard to get its message across or to try to get any emotions out of you. It's a far too subtle and superiorly made movie for that.Most credit of course needs to go to Federico Fellini, who does a wonderful job with the storytelling. But the cinematography also is an important aspect. The movie has some very dynamic camera-work in it, that makes the movie a very lively and warm one, even thought its shot in 'cold' black & white.But just as much credit needs to got to Mrs. Fellini, or rather said Giulietta Masina, who plays the lead role. She goes through some amazing transitions throughout this movie and she was an actress that could act just as well with just only her eyes and facial expressions. Truly a wonderful performance and all a real pleasure to watch. It's probably even a better performance than the one in the other Fellini movie \"La strada\", which was also a movie that I just loved.Simply storytelling and film-making at its very best!9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

She exudes emotional depth, and an abundance of animated expressions. But through most of the film, Cabiria's attitude is too belligerent to render her sympathetic. Yes, she has lots to complain about. But early in the film, we don't know that. And the expressiveness that makes her so endearing in the last Act makes her callous at the start.\"Nights Of Cabiria\" is a typical Fellini film, in that it lacks basic plot structure. Instead of weaving a unified story from an underlying premise, the film mostly presents viewers with a series of unrelated vignettes. We see Cabiria in varying situations, and how she reacts to an assortment of secondary characters. But these vignettes are presented in structural isolation. Only toward the end does Fellini begin to connect the dots, and thereby compose a cinematic portrait that is thematically coherent.Not only does the screen story lack structure, the dialogue is maddeningly talky. And again, most of the chatter is battling and argumentative. It gets stale, quickly.Visually, the film looks great. The B&W cinematography conveys wonderful lighting contrast, especially in the nighttime scenes, along with a variety of camera angles and interesting compositions. The background music also contributes to the film's artistic feel.Overall, however, the film's structural weakness, the expressed hostility, and the talky dialogue burden the film to the point that I just can't recommend it, except to viewers who naturally gravitate to Fellini's unorthodox style of film-making.",

There is a magic here both within the story and the way Fellini makes us believe and encourages us to believe. We see the near tragic incident at the start, where all seems over before it begins, witness not only a recovery but a seeming renaissance, a true new beginning and then we seem to be back where we began. But for that sparkle in the eye. Is that a childlike spark of joy from behind those tears?

Giulietta Masina's performance is truly one of the most impressive I've ever seen - her face is as expressive as Buster Keaton's or Charlie Chaplin's.The movie is a deceptively simple story about the day-to-day encounters of a prostitute who does the best she can to make a living and maintain her hopes and dreams of a better life. Her relationships with her neighbors, friends, and street-corner associates are a major focus, as are her relationships with the many men that come and go in her life. In the latter regard, it is obvious that this film was the inspiration for many other plays and films, including Sweet Charity. The series of people encountered by Cabiria in the movie shows us the full range of human reaction to life's adversity - some respond with cynicism and prey on others without remorse, some respond with generosity and hope, some respond by clinging to certain belief systems that don't really help them in a material way, etc. Cabiria definitely stands out as a unique character within the gritty, grimy community of post-war Rome, where there are stark differences between people of different classes and livelihoods. We can see that she is a good person living in a world that is not always humane or fair.I won't give away the ending, but I will say that it took a lot of creativity and inspiration to include the ending of this movie as it is - I'm sure it was as startling and unexpected to audiences in 1957 as it is emotionally moving still today.The direction, photography, and acting are all first-rate in this classic. Everybody involved was obviously engaged in a labor of love. I cannot recommend it more highly.",

Over an over again she is brought to believe that she can reach absolution and happiness, by means of dreams, by means of people, by means of religion, yet every tie she is deceived, just to raise again and get back to fighting life with her unforgettable smile among tears. The film is very well made, and represents a milestone of the evolution of Fellini from the neorealistic films of the first part of his career to the more sophisticated and aesthetic movies of the next decades.

            "content": "`Le Notti di Cabiria', Federico Fellini's 1957 Academy Award winning film, is a poignant, touching and timeless work of Italian cinema.  The film details the life of Cabiria (played by Fellini's wife Giulietta Masina), a `night bird' who leads a cynical life of prostitution on the streets of Rome.  Throughout the film, Fellini guides us through her search for true love, refuge, and eventual salvation.  Her poetic story is one of sadness, hope, and the unending search for a true place to call home.  Giulietta Masina's brilliant performance draws her audience into her ravaged world and leaves them forever changed.Cabiria has been a prostitute since her youngest days - she recollects entering the streets at 15 with `long, dark hair', unaware of what she was getting into.  As we learn in the opening scene, she has been consistently taken advantage of by men, yet attempts to walk a fine line between clinging to them in a search for true happiness and remaining ever independent and self-sufficient.  As soon as the film opens, she is robbed by her pimp, and later spends the night with a self-consumed wealthy director.  However, the director throws her in the closet as soon as his girlfriend arrives and in the morning quickly escorts a sad Cabiria out of the house, with all her hopes crushed.  During the film Cabiria is frequently enticed by the promise of a new life in her encounters, yet consistently meets impending doom.The most heartbreaking theme of the film is Cabiria's hopeless search for happiness and salvation.  We see that her friends in the business are no better off - Cabiria's story is a universal account.  She is cynical and cold only because of the tragedy she has suffered when she has chosen to share herself.  However, she makes a gradual transformation throughout the film as soon as she meets D'onofrio - a handsome, intelligent and caring man who finds Cabiria at a comedy show.  Cabiria is at first doubtful and aloof around him, but as the story progresses becomes more open and loving.  She has finally found the answer in D'onofrio; she proceeds to sell her house and gather her life savings to live the married life as her mother had with D'onofrio.  In the end of the film, her hopes are once again crushed as Fellini brings us to a cliff overlooking a river, the same setting as the opening scene in which Cabiria was robbed by her pimp and thrown into the river.  Cabiria recognizes why D'onofrio has taken her there, breaks down crying and asks for him to throw her over the cliff.  D'onofrio takes her life savings and leaves her on the cliff to her sorrows.  Fellini ends the film with a shot of Cabiria looking into the camera smiling through her tears - she still has some hope for humanity inside her.It seems that no matter how desperate her struggles, Cabiria can not leave her life on the streets.  She tells D'onofrio that as a teenager she and her friend Wanda had tried to escape the streets through starting a newspaper stand and could never get it off the ground.  Perhaps it is something about Cabiria that keeps her working on the streets, perhaps it is her eternal hope in the goodness of mankind.  She will never stop believing someone good is waiting for her out in the obscurity of the night.  While at a holy site where Mary was to have appeared, she begs in tears for Mary to change her life.  Her prayers, expectedly, are not answered.  In `Le Notti di Cabiria', Fellini breaks our hearts through Giulietta Masina's brilliant portrayal of an infinite search for love amongst a dark world ravaged with deceit and pain.",

By today I mean since its re-release, uncut in the late 1990's. The sequence with the man with the sack, mysterious at first as he descends into holes in those marginal wastelands on the borders of Rome. From his sack he gives to the starving and the homeless who live there. No wonder Fellini wanted it restored. It is a shameful contrast to the Via Veneto where the rich and the tourists indulge their pleasures. Cabiria, who is a prostitute, goes to both areas, and it is a symbol of her life; longing for the security of a real home and husband, and the life of vagrancy that arguably society has driven her towards. Giulietta Masina gives her greatest performance playing her. Not beautiful in the conventional sense but beautiful to the core of her being, she gives herself to one inferior man after another. The saddest scene is when she meets a fading male actor, rich and wasteful who takes her briefly into the world of the rich. Amadeo Nazzari, a famous actor in his own right, bravely takes on this role and is superb. This scene alone justifies the scenes with the man with the sack. She gets a glimpse of a world she is not part of and never will be, and returns to her companions on the streets, and the men who try to kill her for the amount of money she does have. In this poverty world she cannot fulfill her dreams of romance and being truly wanted, and in the final scenes with their despair and pitiful hope, Fellini soars to his greatest heights. Pasolini worked on the film as well and it shows. The film 'Accatone' made by him is a few years ahead but the deprived landscape is similar. 'Le Notti di Cabiria' for me has a double meaning. It is not only her nights on the streets, but her journey into the dark night of the soul and her fight to return to the light.",

It's use of character is so clear and on point while it's perfectly acted, centered on Giulietta Masina's wonderful performance as the eponymous Cabiria. From the opening to its tragic but still hopeful ending, Nights of Cabiria is a marvelous creation from a director who is in full command of every element on screen.The joys of this movie are evident from the beginning. Masina was a well known comic radio performer when she met her future husband Fellini during the war, but her talents extended to the physicality of her performance. As Gelsomina in La Strada, that was obvious and to the forefront, but when Cabiria, who has just been rescued from the Tiber after her boyfriend pushed her in and stole her purse, she arrives at her small stone house in the middle of a desolate stretch of land just outside Rome and needs to get in. The way she holds her body as she peeks through the keyhole and pushes a barrel to her window to sneak through it just so eminently watchable and interesting. She contorts her body in fun ways to do simple things.Anyway, the movie is a series of episodes as Cabiria navigates her life and the contradictions that she has built into herself. As a streetwalker, she's always hoping for a man to settle down with. She's surprisingly independent financially, but she wants a savior to take her away. She's been hurt by men, but she's always looking for the one. She's viciously cynical on the outside, but she's still got the tender heart of a young girl on the inside (the heart of gold, so to speak). The episodes themselves range from her getting picked up by a famous actor who ends up leaving her in his bathroom all night when his girlfriend shows up tearfully after a fight and the couple reconcile to Cabiria going with some fellow prostitutes on a pilgrimage to a remote church where a miracle was to have occurred. Though these events are unconnected by a strong plot, they are tightly connected by a strong sense of character exploring a central theme.That theme is the idea of the contrast between who we are internally and who we are to the rest of the world, with another idea that feeds into it, the vacuousness of the modern world. Ultimately what Cabiria wants isn't a man, or money, or a way out of her life, but meaning. Her life of walking the streets at night and sleeping during the day is unfulfilling, and she searches for meaning where she can find it. The key to this part of the story is the pilgrimage. It's there, in that out of the way church, surrounded by people, that she reveals herself fully (one of only a few times that she does) as she begins joining the chant for the Madonna to bless her and give her the escape that she so sorely needs and wants. There's commentary about how Fellini uses the spectacle of the Church, but I think a lot of it misses the mark.The spectacle we see in this and La Dolce Vita is the spectacle of the people rallying around extraordinary spiritual events that may or may not be true. Both films contain crowds of people trying to take part in a miracle, but in Cabiria, the main character doesn't get anything. However, we do see people with religion at their heart walking at the edge of the scene, asking quietly for help, and they seem far more content than Cabiria, implying, to me, that there is power in religion to Fellini, but it cannot be a mass event. The spiritual touch of God, to Fellini, was a personal and quiet one.Everything seems to change for Cabiria when she goes to a magic show and is hypnotized. On stage, she play acts a meeting with a nice man named Oscar in her mind where she reveals her real name (Maria, which she only reveals in her most vulnerable moments) and her dreams of living peacefully. Angered after she comes out of the daze, she storms off only to be met by another Oscar who eagerly wants to get to know her better. They see each other repeatedly with Cabiria wondering what the whole innocent acquaintance means until Oscar proposes. He's fine with her past life as a streetwalker and has paid for everything since they met, so his motives must be pure and she accepts. The joy in her as she tells Wanda, her friend, of the news is infectious, but this being a Fellini movie, this can't end well, and it does not.You see, when Cabiria was on stage, she revealed that she owned her own house outright which implies that she has some decent amount of money. Oscar clung to that until he convinced Cabiria to marry him, after which she sold her house and took out all of her money (which came to about 750,000 lira which would probably be about $12,000 today) as her dowry. Oscar, though, was playing a long game and steals her money in her purse in a scene that recalls the opening scene of Cabiria being thrown into the Tiber by her previous boyfriend. And then we get the fulmination of the movie's central ideas and characters as Cabiria, broken and robbed, walks back from her secluded spot in a strange part of the country when she comes across a roving band of young people just playing music as they dance down the road. Cabiria tears up, her tear smearing her mascara like a painted tear on a clown. Slowly, her frown turns into a smile and she glances at the camera. It's a marvelously magical moment that caps the entire film of a woman, beaten down and abandoned by everything she tries to invest herself into, never loses who she is underneath, finding that there still is life worth living mere minutes after she begged her new husband to murder her because she couldn't take the pain of the betrayal.Nights of Cabiria is a great film. It fits well in Fellini's earlier period with grounded aesthetics built on real Roman locations including caves and street corners and also has touches of the elements that would later come to define his films, the carnivalesque atmosphere and parades, but they're far more in the background and never really the point. The point is always Cabiria herself, her contradictions, and her spirit. I adore this film.",

            "content": "It would be far too simplistic to feel that the film merely presents an optimist's commitment to live and enjoy life in an imperfect world. \"Nights of Cabiria\" has always intrigued me among the many Fellini films that I have seen\u0097-it is great cinema that asks more questions than it provides answers.Question one\u0097who is the altruist who provides alms in the night to the wretched of the earth? The only reason for the addition of this character seems to be that Fellini wants a contrasting figure who works in the night\u0097one who gives sustenance to others in a commendable way\u0097a way Cabiria would have preferred to live her life if she had an option. It was amusing for me to find out that this entire sequence was deleted in earlier released versions of the film. My guess is that this sequence was an addition of screenplay writer Pasolini, as it would fit into his style of Christian Marxism, more than the neorealism of Fellini. Interestingly, this is one of the three males in the film (others being the actor who invites Cabiria home, and Brother Giovanni) who seem to have a pure heart and good intentions\u0097all the others seem to have a predominant evil streak.Question two\u0097-Brother Giovanni leaves a profound effect on Cabiria. Confessing to him (she thinks he is a full fledged priest) and having Mass celebrated by him was Cabiria's wish but the cold response she receives from Giovanni's colleague, who is apparently a full-fledged priest, seems to be Fellini's/Pasolini's comment on the Church\u0097otherwise why have the scene? Question three-\u0097Cabiria's eyebrows change their shape as she contemplates a married life. This is not in line with Fellini's Cabiria, who would think about the effect eyebrows will make as she switches gears in her personal life. Or is Fellini suggesting that as Cabiria steps on the threshold of marriage, the personality of Cabiria changes to a more calculating woman, in contract to the earlier simple, waif like personality.Apart from questions such as these, it is unquestionably one of Fellini's finest films. I preferred \"La Strada,\" another Fellini film with his wife Guilietta Massina in the lead role, and his later less talked about \"Orchestra Rehearsal,\" made some 20 years later, in which social commentary takes center stage and storyline the backstage.I am surprised that most Fellini viewers are taken up with performances and the story each Fellini film offers. The more poignant world of Fellini revolves around the commentary on the divide between the rich and the poor, the honest and the dishonest, the religious and the agnostic. The allure of Fellini to me remains his social commentary\u0097-he underlines this with Cabiria, in the final shot looking at you the viewer, bringing up the nexus between the character and the viewer. In fact, this final shot ought to wake up the sensibilities of the laid-back cinema viewer.",

            "content": "Rome, 1957. A woman, Cabiria, is robbed and left to drown by her boyfriend, Giorgio. Rescued, she resumes her life and tries her best to find happiness in a cynical world. Even when she thinks her struggles are over and she has found happiness and contentment, things may not be what they seem.Wonderfully engaging movie from Federico Fellini. There's a lightness and sweetness about the main character that makes her easy to support. Some great comedy too. It's not all wine-and-roses though. There is a fair amount of struggle, bitterness and cynicism involved. The ending is particularly cynical, possibly too cynical. I am generally not in favour of Hollywood, happily-ever-after, endings but this story deserved a bit more happiness and closure than it ended with.While Fellini pulls the strings to perfection, it is the performance of Giulletta Masina as Cabiria who makes the movie. Street-wise and sassy yet sweet and vulnerable. Very funny, yet able to convey great sadness and struggle too. Some of her physical comedy is Chaplinesque in its brilliance. Her performance spans the whole gamut of human emotions and expressions and she does it incredibly well. Incredibly engaging and it is this engagement that makes the movie so great.",

            "content": "It is almost considered heretic to write something negative about Fellini. As a matter of fact, Fellini succeeded to create an ambient of adoration around him like possibly no other film director ever. However, all is not gold that glitters.In Fellini's \"Cabiria\" we see some whores of Rome, although they are bitterly poor and misused by their pimps, jumping and dancing in the streets, merrily laughing, having fun with drinks and food all together enjoying their lives. Even the pimps are there, and if something bad happens than it is a curse or a smashed car-door, not more. And when they fight, it is less harmful than amongst children. Even in one of the last scenes, where an old whore is shown who must live in an earth-cave: she is happy, and as long as the angel provides her with food, she thanks god that she is allowed to have such a miserable existence. Fellinis whores have no diseases, and when they suffer, than because of loneliness and not from hunger, gonorrhea and bloody limbs.It is hard to believe, yet true, that the screenplay of this movie was written by Pier Paolo Pasolini, by the same Pasolini who portrayed the world of the whores of Romes in a quite different way than Fellini did. In film theory, one tries to absorb this difference by a notion of time: Fellini is \"realistic\", Pasolini is \"neo-realistic\". In literature one would speak about the difference between realism and naturalism, and in truth one has to speak about the difference between the blissful stupidity of Fellini who by guarantee never has made a step down to Ostia and Pasolini who lived there and was killed there. Pasolini's \"Mamma Roma\" is not a childish grinning clown-esquire puppet like Masina's \"Cabiria\" with her school-girlish white socks, but the Academy Award went to Fellini's wife and not to Anna Magnani. Clearly, Fellini who resided on one of the 7 hills of Rome made the money, Pasolini was 36 times before court and was poor almost like his friends in Ostia.This is bitterly sad because it is objectively false. One of the main reasons why the big earthquake came in film in the Sixties, called \"Nouvelle Vague\", \"Neue Welle\" of \"New Wage\" is that film makers in whole Europe were fed up with rose-red lies, conformism, idealistic prosthetics of fascism and other wonderful post-war achievements. In Germany, Fassbinder ended brutally the \"Schulm\u00e4dchen-Report\"- and \"Lederhosen\"-culture. In France, the \"grandfather of Nouvelle Vague\", Jean-Pierre Melville, lead the level of the French gangster film up to that of the best American Film Noirs. And it Italy? In Italy where the fascism was almost more popular after than during World War II, supported by the Catholic church, Fellini continued his artificial sugar-sweet artistic, astonishingly untouchable by any critique who wanted to make film besides Fellini. Less than 20 years after \"Cabiria\" was released under his own collaboration, Pasolini knew only one answer to the deplorable and miserable intellectual situation in Italy: his gigantic masterpiece \"Salo\" (1975).",

Basically Maria 'Cabiria' Ceccarelli (BAFTA nominated Giulietta Masina) is the wide-eyed street walking prostitute with not many friends but a seemingly good outlook on life, and despite living on the poor end of Rome she does have a small house, a bank account and her dreams to keep her going. The story follows Cabiria through a few nights (and days) spending time with various men who have the same thing in common, they all treat her rotten and disappear very quickly. These mistreating men include a man who steals 40,000 lire and almost drowns her with her inability to swim, a movie star who pays little attention to her, and a man of god giving to the poor but again not drawing to her in any way. All Cabiria can do is spend a little time with her friend Wanda (Franca Marzi), and religious services to pray to the holy one in order to have her dream of a better life come true, including finding a man who truly loves her. After helping an illusionist/hypnotist act on stage she meets accountant Oscar D'Onofrio (Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier) who seems genuinely kind and as they get to know each other liking the idea of a future together, at first she is cautious and suspicious, but she does fall in love with him. They marry within only a few weeks, and during their honeymoon they spend time walking through the woods and towards a cliff overlooking the lake, and Oscar becomes very suspicious indeed. Cabiria realises he intends to push her off the cliff and steal her money, so she just gives up her purse and lets him get away, but walking down the long road back home she can only smile through her tears in a parade of people, she must be hopeful that things will be alright. Also starring Amedeo Nazzari as Alberto Lazzari, Aldo Silvani as The Wizard, Dorian Gray as Jessy, Ennio Girolami as Amleto, Mario Passante as Uncle of Amleto and Pina Gualandri as Matilda the prostitute. In the leading role Masina, also Fellini's wife at the time, is wonderful with her quirky facial expressions, venerability and child like attitude, she is pretty much the key to why this film is so watchable, the character having all these misusing men are the most interesting scenes, it is a thought provoking and enjoyable masterpiece, a great drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Very good!",

            "content": "Ever since I was bored to tears by both 8 1/2 and La Dolce Vita; Federico Fellini hasn't been at the top of my favourite directors list. However, he went up a little in my estimation after I saw La Strada, and Night of Cabiria ensures that my opinion of him has risen further still. The film is a very bleak portrayal of the life of a young woman in Italy, who becomes the victim of several men; but isn't completely blameless herself. The film starts with a sequence that sees this woman, named Cabiria, dumped into a river shortly before her purse is stolen by her supposed 'love'. Any sympathy we have for her is quickly lost after she is rescued by some helpful villagers, and proceeds to mock their rescue by being very rude indeed. The central character is very hard to like, as she's seriously lacking in good points; but this seems to be the point of the movie. Cabiria doesn't treat others very well, and as such; she doesn't get a good deal very often herself. The character is never really allowed to develop - she always has the same motives, but her situation changes around her - and Fellini gives us a cinematic interpretation of the old proverb 'a leopard never changes its spots'.The film takes place largely in the downtrodden areas of Rome. Fellini does an excellent job of enforcing the character's situation on his audience, and the black and white cinematography helps to ensure that the movie always looks suitably bleak. This film represents a reunion between director Federico Fellini and his La Strada star Giulietta Masina. Masina delivers an energetic performance, which ensures that the film is never boring; but it also means that her character often appears over the top, and the film loses credibility because of that. To be honest, I don't think this actress suits the film too well. She fit her role in La Strada like a glove, and it may be for that reason that she is hard to accept in such a different persona. Anyway, the style of the film is great; Fellini ensures that the film feels very Italian, and this combined with the energy from the lead makes the film more enjoyable than quite a few similar art films. The ending is great, and fits everything leading up to it brilliantly. This is the only way the film could have ended properly; making the climax both fitting and satisfying. Overall, Nights of Cabiria is an excellent classic film and one that I recommend to fans of art cinema.",

The main protagonist is an ordinary prostitute in Rome. The story follows her adventures and life experiences.This is a very touching film in which a seemingly innocent life becomes a victim of unfortunate circumstances and conflicts between pathos and irony. Emotions are strong and visible even in the smallest details. The fear in this film almost does not exist. This is a very bold move by Mr. Fellini, considering that he deals with a life story. Scenes and dialogues are mostly tragicomic. Mr. Fellini made a kind of emotional trap, which causes a strong sense of optimism in the viewers.Giulietta Masina as Cabiria Ceccarelli is \"funny face\" with which we can read the children's joy, sadness, bitterness of life, love, temperament and hope. She is lost in her own emotions, playfulness and temperament. That is why the story is interesting and unpredictable. A charismatic and a somewhat eccentric prostitute tries to rise from the world to which she belongs. She is cheerful and positive. Her appearance is at least reminiscent of a \"Countess\" from the street. She is s sort of a female Chaplin. However, she is not dancing tramp of the street. She is a small woman who wants a change in her life in a rather confusing and hostile world.

            "content": "Disagreeing with many of Federico Fellini's opinions, I don't deny that he has not belonged to the list of my favorite directors. Some of his movies are really difficult and a bit psychedelic. However, I have to admit one thing clearly: Fellini was one of the few men in cinema who was able to create something really powerful, captivating, enthralling, controversial, something really innovative: and that is what one may undeniably say about NIGHTS OF CABIRIA, his 1957 movie where again, after marvelous LA STRADA, he cast his wife Giulietta Masina in the lead, a performance that may be regarded as one beyond any awards. But let me analyze the content of the movie first before I comment on acting.Cabiria, an outsider among outsiders who is \"living the life\" is a Roman prostitute whom we find rather individual and with whom, from the very beginning, we can easily empathize. She is robbed, thrown to the Tiber River and, fortunately, rescued by a group of men. From this \"in media res\" opening moment, we start to get to know her. In spite of Cabiria's profession, she is not that \"immoral.\" What Cabiria gets through is disappointment. She cannot understand that someone who always said \"I love you\" stole a few thousand Lira and was going to kill her. Although she seems to have a friend at her side, Wanda (Franca Marzi), also a prostitute, she feels lonely and desperate. The director masterfully supplies us with Cabiria's physical and psychological journey through different places, realities...something very life-like. Therefore, the movie appears to be built upon various worlds=various moments that do not have much in common with one another but which constitute a perfect integration at a higher level of life analysis. This is rather a series of events than a linear plot and... these events are really unforgettable being embedded in highly unpredictable action.Perfect harmony, wonderful insights into social realities, memorable, innovative, brave (as for these times) MOMENTS. Fellini appears to draw a parallel between Cabiria's experiences and everyone's life. Consider, for instance, the main motifs why she goes to these different places: she wants to find herself, looks for happiness, looks for love. Does she find it? Difficult to say... I particularly loved the moment she is so confused in a luxurious house of a famous film star, Alberto Lazzari (Amedeo Nazzari), but, from the social point of view, so lucky to get the autograph of his. But does this autograph give her satisfaction? A different must see moment is the visit to the Sanctuary of the Amore Divina - a pure realism of people in prayer trance shouting \"Grazie Madonna!\" Cabiria seems to be touched by them but is she able to ask Madonna for the right thing? Events are one factor why I really appreciate this film.Another reason for my love to this movie are the top notch performances. The cast, particularly Giulietta Masina (foremost she), make NIGHTS OF CABIRIA nearly a masterpiece. Giulietta Masina patterns her acting on purely original building block of cinema's charm which is FACE. That is where you can read her feelings, that is where you realize what is going on. As a matter of fact, dialog is only an additional aspect when applied to her. From portraying anger, disappointment, confusion, trance, hope, to affection, sorrow and yet an optimistic smile, Giulietta is a marvel! I would not compare her acting to the ones in other Fellini movies, including LA STRADA and JULIET OF THE SPIRITS, because she is unique as Cabiria, the same as she is unique in the roles of Gelsomina or Giulietta! The supporting cast also give fine performances, particularly Francois Perier as Oscar D'Onofrio, Amedeo Nazzari as Alberto and Franca Marzi as Wanda, seemingly Cabiria's real friend.But for me what will always play a decisive role after seeing this movie is the specific Italian charm of long ago. This is something I found in many old Italian movies and and that is something Fellini managed to entail here like other geniuses of cinema from his country. The film is nice to watch but not light to watch, it has reflections but also relaxation, all is in its right place. Moreover, all is enriched by the wonderful music by Nino Rota, a genius with whom Fellini worked with many other movies.As one reviewer before me has already stated, NIGHTS OF CABIRIA is like Cabiria's or Giulietta's smile, the smile of optimism, the smile of long ago, the smile that after 50 years still moves us and uplifts us. What was happiness for Cabiria? Was it the luxury she found in Alberto's life? Was it a group of pilgrims she joined? Was it Frate Giovanni who insisted on maintaining the Grace of God? She illusively found her angel in D'Onofrio; yet the truth occurred entirely different. What is happiness for us? Have we found it or is it just like in Cabiria's life...it passes by as such an unnoticeable, simple thing and we look for it and expect it in totally wrong places? Great movie as a real experience and touching empathy with the heroine. 9/10! If it's one of the first Fellini's films that you see, you're on the right track!",

            "content": "At long last, I finally managed to sit through a Federico Fellini film without falling asleep well before the halfway mark. And it only makes me wonder if I should've started my stint with the influential Italian filmmaker's works with this one instead of 8\u00bd which I still have no desire to return to, having tried it several times before yet falling prey to its sleep-inducing power every single time.As for Nights of Cabiria (Le notti di Cabiria), the film is a surprisingly accessible, thoroughly human & consistently tragic story of a woman who longs for love & happiness yet only finds pain & heartbreak on every turn. For a narrative like this, it is necessary to have a character who viewers can get behind, one who can compel them to invest in their journey but Cabiria didn't intrigue me enough.Instead, from her first scene, she comes across as naive & arrogant. And as the plot moves forward, her heartaches turn out to be less coz of bad luck & more due to her own stupidity. Nevertheless, beneath her bitter skin, there also lies a purity that Giulietta Masina is able to capture & express beautifully when she isn't hyper or hammy. And she hits perfection in the last minute that also drives home the film's point.Overall, Nights of Cabiria is a bleak yet hopeful story about the indomitable will of the human spirit and renders it through the titular character's unfortunate journey through life. The film's final moment leaves a lasting impression of its own and in retrospect also redeems everything that came before but there is a lot of meandering to get there. It does better when connecting the dots later than in the moment. And in the moment, it was a slog.",

All that, and he could do the million-and-one other things necessary to create what is, after all, a treasured objet d'art that speaks to the masses about what is universal and important; true love.  And it does all this absent a cop-out \"feel good\" ending!I'm so thankful for the recent restoration and DVD, including the reinsertion of the \"man with the sack\" scene.  I was particularly thankful for De Laurentiis's angle on the story of the original excising of that segment.  It only serves to impress upon us that Fellini was in no wise kidding when he characterized himself as a professional prevaricator.  Amen to that!  And see this movie!

            "review_title": "a potent feminism manifesto from Fellini and a master-class performance from Masina",
            "content": "NIGHTS OF CABIRIA, Fellini sixth feature film, which marks that he has assertively reached the full- blown phrase in his creativity and sleight-of-hand at the age of 37, and anticipates the acme of his career, LA VOLCE VITA (1960) and 8 AND A HALF (1963). The story (with Pasolini inside the coterie as a collaborator), is a tale of woe about a roadside streetwalker Cabiria (Masina) in Rome, whose real name is Maria Ceccarelli.In the opening long shot, we see Cabiria gambols with his beau on a Sunny day in the field near a river, and quick as lightning, he grabs her handbag and pushes her into the water. Cabiria is almost drowned, the same course of events will (almost) replicate itself in the arresting culmination, this time, with another suitor, a well-groomed but greasy self-claimed accountant Oscar (P\u00e9rier). Why Cabiria hasn't learn anything from her miseries? It is much easier to shoot out pointers in post- mortem, in fact, as we audience follows closely to these non-interrelated episodes of Cabiria's experiences, her wretched destiny doesn't strike more like a subjectively injudicious decision than a fusillade of flak targeting at the injustice of contemporary society and the worst of human vice.Cabiria is petite, petulant and starry-eyed, apart from a narrow escape from death thanks to her dastard boyfriend, she is perfectly content in her own achievement, her self-reliant means of earning secures her a house of her own and some savings in the bank, even during her serendipitous \"one-night-stand\" with a famous movie star, Alberto Lazzari (Nazzari in his Erroyl Flynn suaveness), in his palatial villa, she is not ashamed of her bog-standard house. Only when she peers from the keyhole of the star's bathroom when Alberto romantically reconciles with his trophy girlfriend Jessy (Gray), she realises there is something missing in her life.A pilgrimage with other working girls jolts her out of her hard earned fulfilment, she transforms from a non-believer to a devotee, daydreams a miracle will bestow on her. After religious epiphany, next in line is prestidigitation, Fellini cunningly alludes to the collusion between them, religion seduces a simple soul and illusion brings her the undoing. In the hypnotic performance, a cynical Cabiria unwittingly reveals herself, the inner child, a love-longing Maria Ceccarelli, which instigates Oscar, a spectator in the audience to conspire his act. Since manifestly Cabiria is not an accomplice of the magician (Silvani), then her state-of-hypnosis is indeed real, which is boldly against the common savvy, and can be perceived as a further tactic to turn realness-and-illusion topsy-turvy, with the sudden arrival of a Prince Charming, willing to marry her and doesn't want to know anything about her past, only with an ulterior motive.Giulietta Masina, what can I say, such a godsend to her hubby, a force of nature can effortlessly entice a viewer to vicariously discern and undergo her character's emotional trajectory, all the more she provoke immense sympathy along the way, the suspense-heightened final revelation is so gut-wrenching to watch yet it is completely captivating and emotive (bolstered by Nino Rota's sublimely emotionally manipulative score). What a triumphant performance, Cannes' BEST ACTRESS honour has never been so worthy!NIGHTS OF CABIRIA won BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURE in the Oscar race, a consecutive second win for Fellini after LA STRADA (1954), unlike its tragic protagonist Gesumina, also played by Masina, who succumbs to the hardship and abandonment, in the coda, Cabiria manages to squeeze a smile through her tears with a parade of people singing and dancing around her, like a phoenix back from the ash, the message is uplifting, she may be homeless and penniless, but she has a true friend Wanda (an ace Marzi, in her very naturalistic mien) to rely on, she can go on working the next day and start every from the scratch, what can not kill you only makes you stronger, girl! Such a potent feminism manifesto, one might not expect it from a Fellini's creation.",

            "content": "Giulietta Masina and Federico Fellini go together like bread and butter. Fellini has often been considered one of the best directors to ever contribute to the industry, and this film is a perfect example of how good non-american cinema can be. If you've seen La Strada already, Nights of Cabiria will seem familiar, but I only say this because the same actress from that movie appears here. Giulietta Masina easily made moviegoers sad and dejected for her portrayal of Gelsomina in La Strada; the naive girl who accompanies an abusive and intimidating Anthony Quinn as he forces her to join him on his circus-related travels. Once again, Masina plays a role in Cabiria that is sure to make the audience sad. This is true for almost the whole movie, but gets especially apparent towards the end. The movie begins with Maria Ceccarelli (Masina), a prostitute being chased by a man near a river. We assume that this is her boyfriend, but then with no warning, he pushes her into the river and steals money from her. After being rescued by some strangers, she still insists on being with her boyfriend. She goes home, and after realizing he's not coming back, starts an argument with her friend Wanda, who tells her no sane person would continue a relationship like that. Later on, we see a rich man who owns an expensive convertible, and Maria goes for a ride to his house. Its interior is very gaudy and expansive, but Maria wants to stay here because she thinks it will make the guy like her. Just when things start to appear normal, the guy's ex girlfriend shows up and Maria is forced to leave his house. Some time after, Maria attends a stage performance by a so called magician and he hypnotizes her to the amusement of the audience. Not being in control of her actions, Maria is extremely angry at being taken advantage of in front of many people, as the magician makes her admit how she wants to be married despite living as a prostitute. Once she leaves the event, a guy named Oscar is waiting outside for her. He and Maria begin a relationship, and after just a short amount of time together, she already decides to marry him. In order to have as much money as possible, she sells her house and acquires 700k lire. Oscar and Maria then arrive at a tall cliffside that has water hundreds of feet below. When Maria starts talking about their future together, Oscar suddenly gets strangely quiet. It then dawns on Maria he's not talking because he secretly wants to kill her by pushing her off the cliff and then taking her money, exactly like the guy at the beginning of the film. Maria, knowing that being a prostitute is no way to live her life, tells Oscar she wants him to kill her, but he only takes her purse and runs off. Abandoned, alone, and now left with absolutely nothing, Maria leaves the cliff and walks down a street that features a parade of unusually happy people playing instruments. I have to say, I really enjoy these types of movies that have a big \"oh, so that's how it is\" moment towards the end. When you see the beginning, you might be a little confused at how Maria is pushed into the water. By the end, you finally understand the significance of the scene because the film ends the way it started. It's also a strange sight to witness a movie that has a prostitute as the protagonist. Just like her performance in the legendary La Strada, Giulietta does not disappoint. Both movies have her playing unlucky and misguided characters, but Nights of Cabiria makes her out to be more tragic. After all, she gave away everything she owned for love and got nothing in return. There's even a scene that involves Maria going to a church to pray to Mary because she feels her dishonest way of life will never end. What a cruel movie. Despite its bleak and depressing outcome, Nights of Cabiria is a film that clearly demonstrates for all to see why Fellini was simply one of the best (and strangest) directors.",

Cabiria's character is essentially an innocent, and it is hard to watch people take advantage of innocents (and innocence).  Well Fellini makes you sit through it, and the effect is awesome.When it finally seems as if Cabiria has found the right man, the viewer cannot help but to be wary after all of the s**t she had to go through with the others.

She gets rescued by some kids and some local people but when she wakes up she absolutely doesn't care about them and is very rude and bad to them. She has had such a hard life, a life where people just use her, a life of no love or respect that most of her mind is just callous.But as we spend time with her, we slowly see that, just like anybody, she too just wants to be loved. But its subtle. She has been burned so many many times that trust is 'extremely' difficult for her.By the end of the movie, we will fall in love with her. You just want to hug her close, kiss her and tell her that she is truly loved for who she and that she will not be harmed. That is how good the acting by Giulietta Masina is (the story too). She has the most expressive eyes that I have seen on screen. If she was in Hollywood, she may have been one of the greatest actresses of all times! This movie is also not for everyone. Its a sort of slice-of-life of just one person, so it doesn't have a conclusive ending. Its not a, she lived happily ever after or she died or she achieved that, kind of movie.

And that, with her spirit, makes watching the film all worthwhile.Fellini wants you to hope for the best for his character Cabiria (Maria) and Giulietta Masina plays her well.

But she does meet her \"prince\", and she is led to believe her story will end \"happily ever after\", and that's when we the audience is let in for a shock of horrific proportions. But, as we sit and watch this unfold, Fellini delivers skillfully what only Fellini can; and in that, we sigh with relief as we are still on Cabiria's side of love and hope.Filmmed in Black and White (subtitled) with all the artistry and rawness of Fellini, this is the type of picture that makes you fall in love with film and story.

Sure, one should be able to judge a film on its own merits, but I feel like it would be more fair to put this one in context of his overall career, seeing as this was 55 years ago...Bosley Crowther gave the film a mixed review, saying \"this one is aimed more surely toward the development of a theme than a plot. Its interest is not so much the conflicts that occur in the life of the heroine as the deep, underlying implications of human pathos that the pattern of her life shows... But there are two weaknesses in Cabiria. It has a sordid atmosphere and there is something elusive and insufficient about the character of the heroine. Her get-up is weird and illogical for the milieu in which she lives and her farcical mannerisms clash with the ugly realism of the theme.\" I include this here merely to show how time has aged this film well -- no critic today would come down so harsh on Fellini.What I actually found most interesting was the producer being Dino De Laurentiis. Now, that in itself is not strange, because he has produced a great many things (and other Fellini films).

Fortunately, his wife was in front of it, and Giuiletta Masina's performance does far more than carry the weight of the plot. She transcends practically every scene, basing her performance on Charlie Chaplin and dancing as much as she can. Of course we love her, but more than that we sympathize for her; despite her job we see her as someone we might know, sweet and gentle but very naive.Also to be commended is the style in which Fellini documents this journey; we are taken through the seedy undergrounds of Rome some 50 years ago. Cabiria's life has its most unpleasant moments, such as the opening sequence and when she goes home with a famous Italian movie star, but Fellini always feels for her and so do we. By the time the ending arrives, we are utterly ensnared in the short, rather unusual looking woman.

I'm glad that I bought and viewed the two DVDs in this order.How the character developed in La Strada was extraordinarily compelling and at its conclusion, I was in distress and tears. I was also in tears at the end of Cabiria, for different reasons, of which I'll keep to myself, so as to not spoil for others.Cabiria, is a plucky little prostitute in a poor, run-down Rome area whose sassy lip and terrier like fight-back saves her bacon, many times. From an attempted drowning at the start, to being a distracting plaything for a film star who gets back with his mistress in front of Cabiria's eyes.There's always that fiery competition and catty dialogue one presumes street-girls the world over are forever rattling off. Bettering themselves, moving on, meeting Mr Right etc. Her entanglements are counterbalanced by that other Fellini (La Dolce Vita especially) fascination, the Catholic church. Cabiria isn't a fallen angel, just one that's stuck in a degrading and constricting 'profession', always at the mercy of someone else.Eventually, she believes she meets her Intended-to-be. The immense joy that radiates from that wide-eyed face of hers then; but at other times can send rods of acute sadness through you in seconds just by a held expression. Maybe, she's the original Meryl Streep, in that, even without dialogue, her face alone can express a whole scene. Direction from one's husband obviously helps.Really very good films generally don't get more than a 9/10 from me. There is always a sliver of room for improvement in 99.9 of films. To get a 10, it has to have a profound, personal effect on me. This did and whilst not having any idea how the film was going to end, my emotions went through every scenario - and back again. When it was in an unexpected way, I just knew that it was the only way that Cabiria, as we'd got to know her, and love her, WOULD have made it.This is an absolute must for anybody and everybody, who has a TV (or PC, or Ipad, or whatever). I'm still bristling with feelings from it, 12 hours after seeing it.",

            "content": "It seems as if every hokey, inspirational sports or teacher movie and every other POW or prison escape drama is marketed as \"a triumph of the human spirit.\"Well, here's the genuine article or, if you want to get fancy, a film about the indomitability of innocence as the title character gets pushed into a river at the start and robbed of all her savings at the end, both by men she thought loved her, and still manages to summon up a teary smile at what Sturges called the \"cockeyed caravan\" of life. If it all seems a bit sentimental, I would agree. That lugubriousness, however, never entered my head at any point in the film can be attributed to the genius of Fellini who, whenever the proceedings seem to be getting treacly, throws in a cynical anti clerical motif or a clear eyed look at Roman slum life, and his wife and star, Giuletta Messina, as the title character, a whore with a heart of gold, to be sure, but also possessed of a nasty temper and a wonderfully comic, misplaced bravado that is continually being stomped upon but which just as stubbornly springs fresh.My only criticism is that following a light and airy first forty five minutes, with the wonderfully comic interplay between Cabiria and an aging, jaded movie star, the movie gets increasingly heavy and dark. It would have been nice if Fellini had saved bit of the whimsicality for the second half if for no other reason then I feel it is this great director's most beguiling mood.Give it an A minus.PS...How many times have you seen that soulless, exurban, Roman cinderblock housing development in Italian cinema of the 50s?",

However, \"Sweet Charity\" being one of my favorite musicals when it appeared on Sundance one Saturday night, I couldn't resist.  And I'm glad I didn't.  Frederico Fellini is a skillful and masterful man.  His direction is absolutely AWESOME, to say the least.  And words cannot describe the glorious performance of his wife, Giulietta Masina.  Fellini did for Masina what Bob Fosse did for his wife, Gwen Verdon on the stage when it was transposed to \"Sweet Charity.\"  Masina is so believable and so real... with that street-urchin appearance, those huge, sparkling eyes, that wistful smile, and her petite figure... she is absolute perfection in the role of Cabiria.

            "content": "Before Federico Fellini became the audacious and surrealistic film auteur of the 1960s he was a lauded and accomplished Italian Neorealistic film director of the 1950s, more in league with Vittorio De Sica and Lucchino Visconti, and no film better represents this era of Fellini's art than his sterling 1957 film Nights Of Cabiria (Le Notti Di Cabiria), written by Fellini, Tulio Pinelli, and Ennio Flaiano (with Pier Paolo Pasolini scripting the Roman street slang), and starring his wife Giulieta Masina. It won the 1957 film Oscar for Best Foreign Film, and deservedly so. The film deals with the trials and tribulations of the impoverished and downtrodden in a humorous but realistic way that Hollywood still does not dare to do. Yet, even in this film, one can see the filmmaker that Fellini was to become in a few years, for, despite its seeming realism, there are many neat touches of Absurdism, Symbolism, and Surrealism\u0085. In many ways, the film is a picaresque of one of the oldest clich\u00e9s: the hooker with the heart of gold, but such a generalization utterly disservices the 'how' of how art affects one, and how it does its task. Masina's brilliant performance, which won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival, is often compared to Chaplin's tramp character, even though it is more like Lucille Ball's TV character of Lucy Ricardo, from I Love Lucy, albeit with depth, delicacy, and heart; such a depth of a character that a lesser actress would have let descend into burlesque. Yet, Cabiria's expressiveness is more subtle and true than either Chaplin's or Ball's characters, for they exist only in comedies, and Nights Of Cabiria is not a comedy, despite some funny moments. Cabiria exists in a far more complex and realistic world than the Tramp or Lucy Ricardo. Her face contorts into twists of pain Lucy Ricardo never dreamt of, and which the Tramp simply shrugged off, or responded to with wild slapstick. Cabiria is wary, mistrusts, and does not seem to learn, frustrating both her and the audience she has gotten to root for her. I knew many such women in my New York neighborhood while growing up. And they can be tough, street smart, yet still gullible enough to fall for an Oscar. That said, critics have disagreed, over the years, over whether or not Oscar was conning Cabiria from the start. I think it's clear he was, for from her answers to the mesmerist he felt she was an independent woman of means, assuming a poor woman would never even go to such a show. One can even see from their scene of meeting at the train station that Oscar is putting on an act, changing his facial expressions the moment he sees her, dropping a toothpick from his mouth, after looking like the consummate con man, and then assuming a weak demeanor to lure Cabiria into his trap. That the woman who makes her living in sex is still so na\u00efve to the ways of emotional sexual involvement says a lot of Fellini's prescience in parsing out realities of character development. Then, when he found out she was a prostitute, he felt a bit guilty, as if preying on someone from his own class, and thus wanted to not know of her 'job'. A part of him, it seems, wants to not con her, at the cliff, and this was why his demeanor is so different. Yet, ultimately, he's a con, she's a whore, and reality dictates they act their parts. But, unlike Giorgio, he is no would be killer. The only question is what his initial con was to be- to marry a woman of means, and then, failing that, to just take Cabiria's money the moment he saw it, knowing his original plan was dead, for he could not sponge off of her. Such small ambiguities, even if not pertinent to Cabiria's ultimate unhappiness, nor the film's ending, makes Fellini an artist of the first rank, for only such artists pay attention to such things. These things, not the great things, are often the difference between greats and minor artists.These sorts of subtleties in common folk are never even broached, much less dealt with, in modern Hollywood films. Such is the richness of this marvelous study in class and self-deception, where humans live in small concrete boxes they call homes, as if lab rats. That the film does not follow a conventional narrative format is a good thing, for it heightens the realistic sense of the film. It also subtly repudiates religion, although not so much in the overtly religious scenes, where Cabiria's spiritual entreaties go unheard, nor where she mocks the religiots as fools, but in those scenes where Cabiria reveals her most human side, the non-fantastic, which is ironic, since she works in a profession that deals with fantasy. The film also deals with survival, at its basest level, for Cabiria barely grows intellectually through the film. Yes, by film's end, one could argue that her latest user and abuser, Oscar, is a step up from Giorgio, whom she began the film with, but has Cabiria really ameliorated?To close, Nights Of Cabiria owes much to City Lights for its focus on the poor, as well as to De Sica's The Bicycle Thief, for its realistic view of life at a certain time and place, especially its end, which simply ends, with no indication of whether or not Cabiria will be better off or not, and this helps viewers more strongly identify with her, because we all are unknowing and uncertain of our futures, and even though Cabiria's uncertainty is half a century removed, the tingle we get in our bellies, at the film's end is a recognition of our fears in her gaze toward us, and despite it's unsettling effect, such butterflies still flap their wings for the future.",

Julietta Masina is a superb actress who had actually sacrificed her might-have-been outstanding career(in fact, what she had accomplished is remarkable,but she could have done much much more as an actress) for the sake of her husband, and that makes her even greater as a human being.Of course, her \"smile through tears\" is unforgettable. Nino Rota's music does not just add to ,but co-creates the atmosphere of the film , the rarest case, when two genii(Rota and Fellini)found each other as wonderful partners-in-art, never trying to overshadow each other.

She survives only by being saved by nearby kids who see her in the water.The film then follows her experiences as she searches for grace and a better life while never leaving the profession she needs to survive. She has bought a small shack she lives in independently and has put some money away in the bank. On one occasion, she encounters a famous movie star, Alberto Lazzari (Amedeo Nazzari), who has fought with his girlfriend. He takes Cabiria home, where she is impressed by his wealth, and enters his bedroom. But his girlfriend returns, and Cabiria has to hide in the bathroom overnight.On another occasion, she participates in an elaborate worship service for healing, at which she prays for a change in her life. But it doesn't come. Nonetheless, she is later impressed when she sees a man helping the poor who live in caves. And still later, a Catholic Brother encourages her to continue to search for grace.Cabiria attends a magic show in which she is hypnotized and confesses her desire for love and regular married life. The mostly-male crowd laughs at her, but Oscar D'Onofrio (Francois P\u00e9rier) intercepts her after the show and says how impressed he was by her and desires to see her again. She initially resists but does continue the relationship until she is fully in love within weeks. After Oscar asks her to marry him, she sells her shack and takes all her money from the bank because she believes they will be setting up a shop in another town after marriage. They meet at a hotel just prior to the wedding, and they go for a walk. Cabiria finally understands that Oscar only wants her 750,000 lire and plans to push her into the water. He runs away with the money, and she slowly returns to a nearby road where she joins a parade of young people. Her face gradually reflects her resolve to keep on living.This is the third of Fellini's trilogy on loneliness. It is anti-clerical in tone while recognizing the importance of the church. Masina is quite a remarkable character actor.",

Some do so in ways which are harmful to others. Some, like Cabiria, harm themselves.Fellini's examination of illusion draws on a rich tradition, particularly in European theatre (the dominance of \"seeming\" over \"being\", illusion and deception over honesty, goes right back to Hamlet and beyond).The film is structured around a series of expositions of illusion, involving a bogus lover, a famous actor, a pilgrimage, a variety show, and, finally, to close the circle...a bogus lover again. Add in the fact that the central character is a prostitute...I think you're starting to get the picture.So if all is illusion, why watch the film? Because the central purveyor (and, more importantly, victim) of illusion (the prostitute Cabiria) is a convincingly-portrayed, complex character who exhibits a tough, life-affirming drive to take on the world (in the best Camusian, post-war existentialist sense). It is this that makes the film such an exhilarating experience. Millions of people in Italy and all over Europe in the 1940's and 1950's had to live in a world which had utterly collapsed. In this world, one did what one could to get by, and religion, love, sensual pleasure, and, of course, the cinema, offered only brief respite from the everyday realities.The classic neo-realist edge-of-city building-site sets add the requisite touch of alienation and barrenness to the action. But this is not the kind of hardline neo-realist tract satirized by Nichetti in \"The Icicle Thief\". Fellini's natural sense of cinema as fantasy enables the viewer to feel good at the end of a film where no conventional feelgood factor is offered. And surely that's an achievement in itself.",

Period. I have watched about 10-15 REAL great woman oriented classics from world cinema right from silent era's 'Way Down East' to 'Johnny Belinda' to Bollywood's Most revered 'Mother India' to 'Anuradha' to Japanese Cult 'Life Of Oharu' to modern masterpiece like 'Incendies'. I was firm that Incendies is the Most Tragic Female film i have ever seen but i am gonna change my views Today after watching Federico Fellini's Nights Of Cabiria. And i am not gonna argue about it with nobody. There's nothing that can change my opinion. Nights Of Cabiria was made in 50s when such stories weren't even part of imagination and Today when i saw it i found it extremely relatable even for 2021. This isn't a bluff i mean it and i mean it fully. So, what's this film got? It has a prostitute as the lead character in Rome who searches in vain for true love. She gets abandoned, she is cheated but yet she didn't stop dreaming that someday there will be someone who will want to have her, not her money. At once, she even rejects the thought of having someone for lifetime as she is convinced that she'll never get someone because her identity doesn't deserve such man and yet she lives only to get shattered again. That scene when she meets a film star and suddenly his girlfriend arrives. She listens their romance through a locked room. Instant heart breaking moment that was. I am sure any other director would have used those bedroom noises but Fellini muted the sound and let the moving background tone do the job. And the climax, those men are playing music instruments and this woman is walking along with that Caravan. She is silent, heartbroken, shattered and almost dead yet she doesn't scream or cry out. I hear the music but i feel her pain. Yes, i am a man and felt the pain of a woman. Giulietta Masina, what are you really? This is just my second film of her after 'La Strada' and i am a big fan of her already. Many legendary Hollywood actresses of that time haven't impressed that quick. I wanted to go with 8.5/10* but i am gonna add 0.5* extra only for this amazing lady. And Fellini man you are a freaking Genius. I don't know how you thought of writing such a mind-blowing script in 50s decade and above that made a staggering Masterpiece that will live Forever. Whenever i will talk about Tragic Woman Tales, i will have Nights Of Cabiria in my Top 3 of All Time. Ohh, top 3? Beat it.. Top Rank Of All Time!RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest.",

We were all sitting around, and my film student friend popped in \"Nights of Cabiria.\" I had no idea what to expect. I had never even heard of the movie. Talk about the proverbial sucker punch! Cabiria has stayed in my mind ever since, and I find myself thinking about her all the time. That's the power of this film. There's no need to comment on the acting and directing, which are simply astonishing. What makes this movie so exceptional is the fact that the audience cannot help but fall madly, tragically in love with Cabiria (and of course with Masina). Throughout the movie, as others have noted, I just wanted to jump into the screen and hug her, save her from those around her and her own naivety. At the end of the day, it is our affection for Cabiria that pushes this movie to the heights of raw, emotional power.And that phenomenon is displayed so beautifully in the famous, magical closing ten minute sequence. I have to admit, when Oscar stole her money on the cliff, and we saw her (yet again) go from the euphoria of being in love to rolling on the ground, begging him to kill her, I was furious. How could Oscar do that to our beloved Cabiria? And more importantly, how DARE Fellini do this to me!!!! And that was the magic of Fellini. He KNEW that, by this point, the audience was so totally invested in Cabiria that her heartbreak was our heartbreak. Widely hailed as one of, if not THE most emotionally powerful endings in film history, Cabiria's final walk through the forest is simply beyond words. The explosive power, again, lies in the fact that we care SO much for this character, and when she smiles through her tears while walking among the festival goers, she looks in the camera (and in our eyes) and nods, letting us know that she will be okay. It's the most generous moment I have ever witnessed in film. I have chills just thinking about it.",

Fellini's approach to the cinema is that a drawer or painter, that's where he started. He had then to find partners to write the script and found only third class ones.The great writers of WWII times in Italy like Moravia, Caesare Pavese and others were not invited, or refused...Fellini was never an active fighter of Mussolini...The result is that Fellini's movies have no dramatic structure... They are mere vignettes. The musical equivalent is Moussourgski's \"Pictures at an Exhibition\". This became a masterpiece only after Maurice Ravel orchestrated it to perfection..In films like \"La Dolce Vita\" and \"Otto et Mezzo\" this lack of dramatic structure is quite acceptable. In Amarcord, which is my favorite Fellini's movie, it is not needed, because it is so close to the truth as a documentary , rings so true and therefore becomes beautiful.But in Cabiria it is badly needed and is missing..When Amedeo Nazzari, in bed, after drinking champagne, prefers to listen to Beethoven's 5th instead of making love to Cabiria, who he does not wish to humiliate, on the contrary, this is the work of guys that know nothing about whores, women or the meaning of Beethoven's 5th.The ending sequence is stupidly pathetic.No wonder that the OIC (Vatican's Movies Office) gave this a prize.Fellini kind of redeemed himself next year in \"La Dolce Vita\" dressing Anita Ekberg as a \"Putana Monsignore\".

Masina's character isn't as sympathetic as the one created by MacLaine. I don't mean that in a bad way. It's just that MacLaine's Charity is dripping in pathetic lovableness, while Masina's Cabiria has been around the block and knows the score. She's a broad who knows how to handle herself, but she's also prone to making decisions that keep her exactly where she is even while she wants to be somewhere else.The ending of \"Nights of Cabiria\" is much darker than \"Sweet Charity,\" and more heartbreaking for it.

It is like watching an eighth grade Italian Kabuki presentation.I have seen and enjoyed many Fellini films. Many have the characteristics seen here, but also include some redeeming qualities; fine acting, attractive people, an engaging story. Not this turkey. Cabiria would have done better to have drowned, as was threatened in the opening scene. Of course she was saved (or there would be no movie) and promptly chews out her rescuers. Just because a film is European, black & white, and done on the cheap does not make it art.I am so glad I rented this instead of buying it or paying to see it in the theater. But, after playing it, I felt like I needed to clean my living room! Absolute dreck! Avoid it like a plague.",

Now I can't disagree with that, because in a certain way it does, but I most definitely can't agree with it. I would describe it differently, although the comparison with wine will still be relevant. The thing that makes this film great, in my opinion, is its 'aftertaste' . While I was watching the film, I was stunned by the acting of Masina, yet not in another way then with 'La Strada'. When the film ended I was very impressed, yet not as much as when I saw 'Otto e Mezzo'. The thing is, I'm finally realising how much I loved this film, while I'm writing this. Maybe the acting wasn't superior to 'La Strada's' acting. I actually liked the rest of the cast better in 'La Strada' (which included Quinn and Basehart besides Masina). Nor was the film as challenging and sophisticated as 'Otto e Mezzo'. But 'La Strada' didn't have a story like 'Le Notti di Cabiria' and a divine character like Cabiria. And 'Otto e Mezzo' didn't have Masina in it. That's what makes 'Le Notti di Cabiria' as memorable as it is. And because of that, this film can be called Fellini's true masterpiece and, by saying that, one of the best films ever made.",

            "content": "Review:I think you can make the argument that Fellini's \"Juliet of the Spirits\" (1965) is the female counterpoint to his \"8 \u00bd\" (1963). Both are films that analyze a central character whose life seems to be coming apart at the seams, in large part due to extra-marital affairs and existential concerns. In \"8 \u00bd\" we have the Guido, who wants to tame all the women in his life to restore a semblance of continuity in his career and in his existence. With \"Juliet of the Spirits,\" we follow Juliet, a woman who has been shattered by her cheating husband and who decides to leave him to restore that same sort of continuity of existence Guido sought.But before \"8 \u00bd\" and \"Juliet of the Spirits\" Fellini made two other films that serve as gender based counterpoints \u2013 \"La Dolce Vita\" (1960) and \"Nights of Cabiria.\" (1959). Both films explore similar characters and similar themes. Fellini's heroes in these films are the bottom rung of society and we watch as they try to scrape their way out of their positions in search of greater meaning and purpose. While \"La Dolce Vita\" is the superior film, \"Nights of Cabiria\" still holds its own.In recent years \"Nights\" has joined Fellini's \"La Strada\" in accruing a wider and wider audience. Slowly, these films are becoming as widely seen as \"8 \u00bd\" and \"La Dolce Vita.\" \"Nights of Cabiria\" tells the story of Cabiria, a tiny and cute prostitute whose innocence is her greatest charm and weakness. Fellini buffs will note that we have met Cabiria once before in Fellini's first feature \"The White Sheik\" (1952). Both times she is played by Fellini's wife, the great Giulietta Masina.Masina always has such an expressive face. In some scenes she can exhibit the angelic demeanor of a child and in others she can look as morose as an old, dying woman. \"Nights of Cabiria\" begins with Cabiria's pimp stealing her purse and pushing her into a river. She nearly drowns. When she is saved she is discouraged to understand her pimp valued her life less than the 40,000 lira he stole with her purse. Cabiria leads a sad existence but she is indomitable. She does not give up, no matter how dire the circumstances.Like with Marcello in \"La Dolce Vita,\" we follow Cabiria through a series of episodic adventures that mostly take place at night. One night she gets picked up by a famous movie star who's had a falling out with his finacee. Another time, Cabiria follows a rhapsodic crowd that longs to have a vision of the Virgin Mary. Another night she meets a Good Samaritan handing out food to the homeless. With this Samaritan, Cabiria meets an older prostitute who used to be a beauty, now living destitute in a cave outside of Rome. For Cabiria, this woman is a forecast of things to come if she doesn't change her life.Thus, when a nice man comes out of the night, expressing love and his intentions to marry Cabiria, she sees her way out. Are these man's intentions true and honest? I will not give it away - but I will say that Fellini has a tendency to bookend his films.The final scene of \"Nights of Cabiria\" is beautiful and one of Fellini's best endings. It is a synthesis of a parade and a party with Cabiria at the center, staring with quiet determination into the camera. Of all Fellini's vivid images, this one may best encompass his vision of the human experience.Rating:On a scale of one to \"Casablanca\", this film is an \"About Schmidt\" (2003).Rationalization:I think you'd be hard pressed to find a person who wouldn't admit that sometimes life can be a series of low-blows and inequities. And yet, we struggle on, trying to make the best of our situations in an otherwise cruel and indifferent world. Movies like these make me grieve and hope for humanity, showing us what is best in our natures while never denying we are pathetic creatures with a loose grip on even our own lives.http://iamdatabasefilmjournal.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "This is a superb vehicle for a very much on-form Giulietta Masina in the title role. She is a lady of the night whom we see, right at the start, being shoved into the river by her robber boyfriend and left to drown. Rescued thanks to an alert local urchin and a few locals. She is shaken but largely undeterred! From now on, we follow her on her continuing escapades as she defiantly refuses to give up on love. She thinks she has lucked out with a champagne and caviar film actor, but is soon further disillusioned and it is only a chance encounter with the rather unassuming \"D'Onofrio\" (Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier) who had admired her on stage one evening, that things might - just might - offer our wandering spirit that which her heart desires most. Fellini uses the still largely war-torn streets of Rome as an effective backdrop to this most human of stories, and the writing allows Miss Masina to deliver her quick-fire, frequently comical (and always unerringly optimistic) dialogue expertly. She is very much in her element as the story develops. There is an air of cynicism to the whole thing, but somehow her character manages to punch through it - and that's what made this entertaining for me. It could have been just a procedural and predictable drama, but it isn't. There are no certainties with the plot. Indeed, the only certainty is that she is never going to give up! The supporting cast deliver really effectively - either as characters with a direct bearing on her life (\"Wanda\" (Franca Marzi) for example) or as a means for the audience to recalibrate and come up for air for a moment or two. It's an emotional film, but not a sentimental one - and I really enjoyed it.",

            "content": "This is the very first time I see an Italian movie, and I loved it! This was very adorable movie. It was a nice journey, that I am glad I took. The movie was produced in 1957, set in the beautiful city of Rome and directed and co-written by Frederico Fellini.The story of the movie is about a pretty crazy prostitute who we join in her journey of life, she looks for love and salvation. It's funny and true. She is an optimist who sings, dances and swears a lot.The idea is really nice, I don't know how often was a prostitute's story shown in a movie in the 1950's, but it's defiantly an interesting idea. Let's see what I loved, I loved how open minded and independent was Cabiria (main character) in the movie, she owned her own house and was so proud of it. She wasn't looking for marriage as much as love.She wanted to change her life and didn't accept just how things were.I also enjoyed how although she went to church and asked for grace from virgin Mary, nothing changed in her life, because she kept it as it.I thought the directing was very good, it kept me interested and enjoying the movie. I loved the scenery and acting of all actors. It was fun, lots of fun, even the soundtrack is fun, please listen to itMy favorite scene involved Cabiria hypnotized and revealing here true innocence in front of many people on stage.I still had few comments that I didn't like, when she met a father in the church, he told her you must get married, it's women's duty to have children and be wives, that was a little lame. And it made me feel as if its sending a message that those who want to be independent, must be bad and that they should go back to their \"natural\" duties. Also it kinda made me sad that although she such an optimist, things never turned out right for her. I absolutely loved the ending scene, brought a smile back to my face.At the end, I would recommend the movie and would say it's very enjoyable. Oh, almost forgot that the Italian language is awesome, extremely lovely to hear. Definitely worth of being on the top 250 list.its-lalas-land.blogspot.com",

They can just show interest in her to make her give them everything she has.\nGiulietta Masina found a great gesture for Cabiria - a wry smile, the smile of shyness and despair, loneliness and uneasiness, and at the same time of great dare and resoluteness. And it is this smile that makes us love and sympathize with Cabiria - a delicate and awkward child who has to overcome herself to earn her hard living. But she is the one who has guts: robbed and betrayed, deceived and disillusioned, she is never beaten; she goes on living, no matter how hard it might be.Although filmed in 1957, \"Nights of Cabiria\" is still exciting and revealing, since it touches the inmost human feelings and depicts true human characters.",

Nights of Cabiria is one of those great films about the dichotomy of life - its capability for extreme pain and simultaneous potential for happiness; this has got to be up there alongside De Sica's Umberto D. and Kurosawa's Ikiru for its powerful storylines about beaten-down characters realizing the beauty in life even in moments of tragedy. However, even compared to those masterpieces Nights of Cabiria has something of a darker tone regrding its protagonist's ultimate fate - her jubilation in the impromptu procession after her devastating betrayal can be interpreted as either a turning point for a future of greater potential, or an exasperated and drained response to an unfroeseen loss. Her representation of the cautious optimism and benevolence of the human spirit even in the face of antagonism (and as a representative of the reemerging but disenchanted postwar Italy, clarified through the context of the charitable organizations and destitution surrounding her) are potent metaphors. The film is made what it is by Masina, who delivers a powerhouse performance with her exuberance and devastation in equal measure. The final ten minutes of this film linger in the air; as the motivations of key characters are revealed to Cabiria her pain disillusionment is our own. Terribly empathetic, Fellini will manipulate your emotions as easily as lighting a cigarette with this one. (4.5/5)",

Though an impossible prostitute (a word that's never used, at least according to Criterion's astute subtitles), Cabiria is tragically naive in the ways of love.  If not love, per se, then perhaps life.  Several key scenes play out before desolate postwar landscapes, the cranes of supposed progress rebuilding the city into an expansively modernist and efficiently sterile version of its former, ancient self.  Another Fellini classic, another soulless soir\u00e9e.  In this film's ill-advised night out, Cabiria mambos the night away and into our hearts (not necessarily in that order) in an upscale yet skeezy night club with no shortage of ominous snake ladies at every table.  Cabiria is out of place in this place, but how could she possibly mind when she's have this much fun?\n\nBut all of that is fleeting.  Though lovelorn and terse, this is still the portrait of a woman who, nevertheless and very deep down, holds out hope for love.

Cabiria is revived by some local boys and runs off by herself, shouting. What follows is a series of similarly humiliating episodes, in which the defiantly positive prostitute Cabiria is hurt, but never broken.\n\nThis feels weird. Because life has gotten so busy, I haven't written a movie review in over a month. For the one person that might read this, I don't write these for other people - these reviews aren't polished, nor are they spell checked, obviously. I write them so I can learn more about film and think deeper about the films I watch. Anyways, I watched this weeks ago so my memory is hazy, but what an old classic this was.\n\n\"Nights of Cabiria\" was a very interesting story. It's the story about how much someone can get sucked up because of lust. How lust / love can blind one person so much and the consequences it brings. It hurts to see and it's unforgivably comical at times. It's a well written screenplay translated to a solid film. \n\nGiulietta Masina did so well as the lead. She really made this character her own. The character isn't the most likable by any means, as she really just an everyday person. But the themes present throughout the film are shown through her character ark, up until the very last scene (which was very nice by the way). \n\nThis is certainly an artsy-esk film that many people probably won't see if they're not in the film industry, but it's one that's pretty good. I'm not the most into old classics but this is a story with some really intriguing and relatable themes.",

Giulietta Masina plays Cabiria, who kind of reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's Tramp in that she's unselfconsiously underclass, rolls with the punches, and full of life. Roger Ebert also believed she was channeling Chaplin. It all builds up to the ultimate betrayal, which can't completely destroy her character.",

It seemed every time there was an opportunity for things to turn around for her, she\u2019d get smacked back down. I struggle with films that are so opposed to their protagonist, because I have a tendency to empathize too much with their ordeal. I appreciated that she had such a positive outlook on things despite all the difficulties she faced, but it seemed to just be the strength of her character that allowed her to rebound. Since there was never a legitimate silver lining, I had trouble finding the same reasons to look on the bright side. I suppose I don\u2019t have the same resiliency. I\u2019m not sure if there is an arc for Cabiria in the film, it just amounts to a series of ordeals where the rug gets pulled out from under her. That being said, it is a well-told story that delivers on the theme of the undying human spirit. Giulietta Masina is superb in the lead role, and does so much emotional work with nothing more than her eyes. She totally blew me away. If this is a style of story that doesn\u2019t faze you, then it might be the best version you could possibly find. It\u2019s just a type of narrative that I find ridiculously hard to watch, but I will say the last few frames of the film were marvelous and did my heart good. ",

Even when she thinks her struggles are over and she has found happiness and contentment, things may not be what they seem.\n\nWonderfully engaging movie from Federico Fellini.  There's a lightness and sweetness about the main character that makes her easy to support.  Some great comedy too.  \n\nIt's not all wine-and-roses though.  There is a fair amount of struggle, bitterness and cynicism involved.  The ending is particularly cynical, possibly too cynical.  I am generally not in favour of Hollywood, happily-ever-after, endings but this story deserved a bit more happiness and closure than it ended with.\n\nWhile Fellini pulls the strings to perfection, it is the performance of Giulletta Masina as Cabiria who makes the movie.  Street-wise and sassy yet sweet and vulnerable.  Very funny, yet able to convey great sadness and struggle too.  Some of her physical comedy is Chaplinesque in its brilliance.  Her performance spans the whole gamut of human emotions and expressions and she does it incredibly well.  Incredibly engaging and it is this engagement that makes the movie so great.",

            "content": "Fellini's movies often involve innocents at cruel odds with a cynical world. In his beloved Giulietta Masina, he found a ideal human form for this theme. Petite, almost elfin, warm and spirited, she was the perfect muse for his vision as the greatness of his movies waxed in the late '50s.\n\nIn La Strada, she plays an almost impossibly innocent woman enslaved to a brutish circus performer. In Nights of Cabiria, Fellini puts her into a seemingly polar opposite. She plays Cabiria, a strong-willed, resilient prostitute, unafraid and defiantly independent. Her principle dilemma is how much of her heart she should permit to open. This is the soul of the movie, Cabiria's attempt to negotiate how much to let in and how much to seal out.\n\nShe maintains a veneer of cynicism, but still manages to open her heart, unwisely to the detestable men she meets, but also to spirituality. She puts her heart into a trip she and her prostitute friends make to a shrine to pray for grace to the Virgin Mary, and a week later realizes that she is the same old whore she was before, that she never got the grace she prayed for, and lapses into a spiteful harangue to a passing parade of nuns. \n\nLater, however, she meets a kind-hearted Catholic brother, and she allows him to reconsider the promise of the Church. She goes to the church the next day to confess her sins to him, but he is not there, and in any case, he cannot hear her confession because he is not yet ordained. Rather than confess to another priest, she tells him she will wait for his ordination. The Church would like you to think that their priests are interchangeable for the purpose of the sacraments, but she knows better. She saw a spirit in him that others lacked, and that's to whom she would open her heart.\n\nThere is one particular scene that is the most important in the movie, and appallingly, it was excluded from the film for over 40 years. One morning, trying to make her way back home after entertaining a customer, Cabiria witnesses a man silently distributing food and necessities to the poorest of the poor, people living in hollows beside the roads on the outskirts of the city. She recognizes one of the poor folk as an ex-prostitute she used to work beside, now haggard and destitute. The man goes about his charity, and gives Cabiria a lift back to the city. \n\nThe man is not in clerical garb and his function is never explained. It's just a thing he does, matter-of-factly, without reward or praise. Cabiria observes him as if he is an exotic creature. She does not understand why he does what he does, but she perceives some special kind of grace from his action.\n\nOf all the scenes in this movie, filled with prostitutes and unflattering images of the Church, the scene that the Church wanted cut from this movie was this one, because it shows a layman tending to the people that the Church should have been aiding. The scene was cut, and not restored until 1998. I suppose this scores low on the list of grievances one might have with the Catholic Church (please see my review of Spotlight), but we can recognize the Church's demand to cut this scene of quintessential human kindness as typically venal and disgraceful.",

Starring Giulietta Masina (wife of Federico Fellini - considered female version of Charlie Chaplin). Film won Best Foreign Language Oscar award, and Masina won Best Actress award at Cannes Film Festival. Fellini also had directed Masina another Oscar-winner 'La Strada 1954 (The Road - Anthony Quinn). Cabiria was a small character, from another Fellini's film The White Sheik.\r\n\r\nCabiria is street-prostitute in the post-ww2 Rome - she lives in her own single-room house that she is proud of to boost in front of everybody, including her bank-account - she is often at fights with other street-prostitutes. Sentimalist as she has been all along, and inconvincible to accept betrayal in love affairs at the hands of men - having been pushed into water by her boyfriend who robbed her of 40,000 lira in her purse, only to be saved by near-by swim-expert children. Her kind-hearted, too interfering-and-yet-sweet neighbor friend Wanda (Franca Marzi) is always there to condole her, despite, often been slighted by Cabiria. \r\n\r\nJust as the case was with me, when I first watched La Strada in 2010. I sent sms to my brother in capital city, telling him, \"I just found reason to live\". Events repeated themselves, after I watched this film, and there was only single word coming out of my repeatedly \"magical\". And by God, I still cannot make up my mind as to where should I begin this review from, what am I supposed to write about legendary personalities like Fellini and Masina. \r\n\r\nYou barely, receive performances as impactful as Masina's - her smile, her making-of-innocent-facial-expressions, her delivery of dialogues, sarcastic use as well as dance-moves (like, when she does in the start of the film on the street) are enough to hypnotize you. \r\n\r\nApart from all this, we come to Fellini's perfect direction, maintaining surrealist atmosphere - and while he does this, there is no space left to suspect artificial use. Is Cabiria really Cabiria? Or a movie-character indeed? - Fellini's mastery at wiping the memory of audience of scene in the beginning, as the movie progresses until the end, makes us wonder at the level of his skill to take the full advantage, when he desires. And he perfectly executes at the climax - and what a sheer heart-piercing climax, it was no lesser than the shocking climax of La Strada.",

I think I could like his film weren't it for his neo-realistic roots (most apparent in the milieus in his films and the notorious scenes of people wandering around in bleak suburbs) and his desire to cast his wife Giulietta Masina in every other of his early films.\nCabiria like Gelsomina in La Strada is an utterly na\u00efve girl who seeks love and luck but seems to not have the guts to actually achieve any of it.\nOf course, this is partly because of the time period the film was made in, but these whimsy and weak female characters are just killing me.\n\nWhat I most enjoyed were the scenes when the neo-realistic bleakness is exchanged with 8 1/2-esque extravaganza (most prominently in the scenes in Alberto Lazzari's house). I think this is more like Fellini's natural environment and I think his visual style suits lavish luxury more than bleak naturalism.\n\nWell, let's continue. After this scene at the film star's mansion, the story goes nowhere for a while until Cabiria meets the next man in her life (the first one, right at the beginning, throw her into a river after stealing her purse), Oscar who she madly falls in love with - and so does he, apparently. It's not that easy though because, as I already mentioned, Cabiria is a na\u00efve, kinda dim-witted, cow.\n\nThe ending is great though, Fellini has a knack for leaving the stage with a big bloody bang and this film proves it.",

            "content": "Aside from being a masterful surrealist, it is also very notable to state that Federico Fellini is also a morally powerful and spiritually transcendent filmmaker. This is, of course, very much evident here in \"Nights of Cabiria\", an unforgettable cinematic masterpiece that traverses the widely unseen and unheard (at the time) world of prostitution and the soulful humanity that bleeds through and through albeit the blind sexuality contained within it. \n     \nAlthough it is much expected that the film shall highlight the more obscene aspect of what many consider as the 'oldest profession in the world' just like, say, Luis Bunuel's later film \"Belle de Jour\", \"Nights of Cabiria\" is surprisingly very mellow with the jobs' details and instead delves not on the inner workings of the affordable sex that they offer or on what motivates prostitutes to continue on doing what they're doing but on the reasons why they should not anymore. At the center of it all is the energetic yet at times very temperamental Cabiria (played by Giulietta Masina), a prostitute who can be the most romantically jaded one minute yet can also be the most hopelessly romantic in the next. With a face that still echoes her heartbreaking turn in Fellini's earlier film \"La Strada\", Giulietta Masina, with her sometimes tomboyish facial expressions and mime-like gestures reminiscent of silent film stars, is a beautiful embodiment of both melancholy and hope. \n     \nWith her consistently comical body language and a face that fluctuates between naughtiness and confusion, Cabiria is evidently a most complex character to pull off. But despite of that, Masina has done it as if without much effort. Yes, perhaps there are no scenes that show her participating in any simulated sexual congress. And yes, perhaps Giulietta Masina does not, in any way, physically resemble an actual prostitute, what with her small stature and relatively frail body frame. But with the help of her masterful evocation of Cabiria's romantic naivety and pure humanity, she has been most believable as one in much the same way Philip Seymour Hoffman is never a dead ringer for Truman Capote (Toby Jones relatively gets that distinction) yet he has made us believe that he actually is the \"In Cold Blood\" writer for close to 2 hours mainly because of how inspired his performance was. \n     \nBut then of course, Giulietta Masina's powerful performance wouldn't really be as penetrating if not for Nino Rota's stirring musical score, the film's often dream-like photography and Fellini's patient direction which has perfectly built-up the film until its heart-breaking yet hopeful finale. \n    \nJust like Fellini's masterpiece \"La Dolce Vita\", \"Nights of Cabiria\" is a film that's highly dependent not on how or where the so-called 'carnival of life' will bring the main characters to but how he/she may figure in the playfulness and hysteria of it all. In one of the film's most resonant sequences, Cabiria, along with her co-workers, joined a small pilgrimage heading towards the Santuario della Madonna so that they can ask her for forgiveness and guide. Albeit her countless pleads for mercy and various promises to change her way of life, Cabiria never felt any better or different, and so do her co-workers. Although a filmmaker that largely incorporates religious symbolism into his films, Fellini seems always aware that religion will always be a mere spiritual opiate and nothing more; that fate solely depends on whatever life a person leads and not on some higher power; that some music and a smile, not some wooden idols and a haplessly fevered devotion to the great unknown, can make the world of difference. With \"Nights of Cabiria\", Federico Fellini has made us all believe that despair can merely be shrugged off by a more than hopeful countenance. \n     \nFor the longest time, cinema has often made us feel the utter fruitlessness of existence and how it is almost impossible to graduate from life pristine and unscathed. \"Nights of Cabiria\", perhaps the best film ever made that deals with the emotional and moral conflict buried deep within the heart of prostitution, is a precious piece of art that genuinely captures the elusive essence of hope amidst anguish rarely seen in today's cinema.",

When she comes to after being rescued by some children, she furiously stomps to her home (which she owns, as she never fails to proudly mention), yelling out the thief's name and scowling. Ten minutes later however, she's all smiles and seems to have forgotten about the incident as she embarks on something else. This is the kind of structure the film has all the way through, many major events occuring in a series of episodes rather than a traditional structure.

She thankfully survives thanks to some passersby who save her, but she continues her journey into pain and neglect. Cabiria is also full of herself, stating she has money and she owns her own house. Masina is magnificent as the lead actress, constantly getting into trouble and demeaning herself to new and bizarre lows throughout the film, not even learning from her mistakes. Interestingly enough, her and Felini were husband and wife until his death (a 50 year marriage), and they did three movies together. This, and \"La Strada\" from 1954 rank among the director and actress' finest films (the other film was Juliet of Spirits from 1965 which I have not seen).

Cabiria (Masina) is a feisty but sweet prostitute living with her friends in the bad parts of Italy. She has many misfortunes and tragic incidents throughout her life, but never stops trying to get a better one. Fellini was not having much success with his films, though highly regarded today, they were mostly flopping. \"La Notti de Cabiria\" was an exception. It is widely considered his breakthrough movie, and it's so easy to see why. This movie is so appealing, dramatic, funny, romantic, and adventurous, and even without a plot (like most of Fellini's films) this movie still is perfect. Fellini makes the most of Italy, and gives us wonderful glimpses at the countryside, as well as some city shots, which I love. It's Masina however, that makes this movie so much fun. She was actually the director's wife, and he had already had her have parts in films like \"The White Sheik\", \"Il Bidone\", and \"La Strada\", but they were all supporting roles, except for \"La Strada\" where Anthony Quinn seems to overshadow her. This is definitely HER film. Masina has often been called the female Chaplin because of her wide use of body language and facial expressions, and I couldn't agree more with the opinion. She is absolutely magnetic as Cabiria, and you really do care about what happens to her. She's excellent in every comedic scene, and does justice to the dramatic ones, proving how much of a versatile actress she was. You can't see her in a movie and not like her. \"Le Notti di Cabiria\" is a wonderful film. Very highly recommended.",

Well fuck, we're just setting these people up for disaster, because someday the rude awakening will come along for everyone and they'll realize: sometimes life is shit.\n\nSo how do you find anything jovial in a world where everyone is really just looking out for themselves? You could start by watching Nights of Cabiria, which stars Giulietta Masina as Cabiria, a prostitute in the slums of Italy's scummiest streets. You wouldn't know it though: everyone dresses fashionably, listens to music, drives new cars and flirts and dances all day. Although, that's just the environment Cabiria surrounds herself in. She really lives in a small shack with a bed and some water, all she really needs to get by. She bought it for about $500, and she doesn't have much more saved up in her bank account. But Cabiria doesn't much care about her financial situation. As long as she's surrounded by her friends and a man who loves her, she's going to be OK!\n\nWell, that's the problem. Cabiria is surrounded by assholes and jealous prostitutes. She has one true friend who cares for her, but Cabiria manages to repeatedly push her away. She's convinced herself that she needs a good man to take care of her and love her. But the men she meets either rob her, abandon her or are too good for her. Hell, one of them is even imaginary. And while these men are shitting all over Cabiria and driving her towards insanity, we have the film's optimistic message in the works.\n\nWhoa, that threw you for a loop, huh? In many optimistic films, characters do overcome oppression and hardships and stuff, but rarely are they so integral to the film's final message. They're just roadblocks that lead to a grander realization that leaves all the hardships behind. And, most of the time, the hardships themselves really tell nothing about the character...other than that their lives suck, man. But in Nights of Cabiria, we're learning more and more about Cabiria as each man uses and abuses her. I don't think I'm being too revealing by just coming out and saying it: Cabiria finally realizes that the only person that can make Cabiria happy is Cabiria herself. It's not an overly complicated message or an especially remarkable revelation, but for this character, it's a matter of life or death.\n\nWe start the film with Cabiria and another man laughing and running happily in a field. While Fellini's greatest strengths as a writer make this a classic film, his best non-experimental camerawork is at hand. We watch Cabiria from afar, running in a seemingly endless, barren dirt field with nothing more than a lake to accompany it. I think it says a lot about the vast loneliness Cabiria must constantly feel, but really it just looks beautiful, revealing the Italian landscape as wide-open for possibilities and possibly cruel and unforgiving. Just when Cabiria seems to settle in with the man, he pushes her into the river and steals her purse. After she's revived by a couple of men (she can't swim), she immediately scolds them and goes searching for Giorgio, who she believes ran away to get help. She's also looking to get her purse back, which he, apparently, politely picked up for her.\n\nWell, we all know he didn't do that. And with each man, we see faults that Cabiria ignores. Alberto Lazzari, a famous actor who takes Cabiria out for a \u00e2luxurious\u00e2? night on the town, is too caught up in his own lifestyle to ever recognize another woman's needs, which is why he's clung himself to an equally selfish woman. The second man she encounters says the most about the woman Cabiria strives to be. With Alberto, she remained herself: she danced ridiculously at the fancy nightclub and never ate the caviar and lobster served at Alberto's home. The second man was kind, shuffling around to various homeless individuals and handing out food. She wanted to walk with him and hitch a ride, but really she just wanted to be with this man. She was intrigued by his sincerity towards others, but really she saw what she really needed: independence. Here was a man who interacted with many people everyday, content with never sticking anywhere too long or having a life partner. Cabiria selfishly wanted this man, but for reasons she wouldn't discover until later.\n\nHer third and fourth men were both named Oscar, except one of them wasn't real. Coincidentally enough, the imaginary man says the most about Cabiria because it's the first time we see her acting freely. At a magician's show, she is invited on stage and put into a trance. In one of the most beautifully heartbreaking scenes I've ever witnessed, we watch Cabiria dance and pick flowers with the never-seen Oscar, who brings forth her desires to be married. She opens herself up to this man, revealing how her hair used to be black and memories of her mother. More than anything, Cabiria wants somebody to open up to, and she believes she finds it in the real-life Oscar, who presents himself after the magician's show. Moved by her story, Oscar persists in meeting with Cabiria and forming a relationship. Cabiria is resistant, but eventually warms up to Oscar. Her friend questions Oscar's intentions, but Cabiria defends him with, \u00e2He loves me!\u00e2? But does she love him? And eventually this question leads to: does she love herself?\n\nThat becomes the final question when Oscar reveals he only intended to marry Cabiria to steal her money. He stands behind her at the top of a cliff, ready to push her off, but is unable to do so. Cabiria's realization of the situation sends her into a hissy fit, and rightfully so. Just when she thinks she's finally found a man to shower her with love and kindness, he reveals that it's all about the money. In one full cycle, Cabiria had shifted through enough men to end up right back where she started at the beginning of the film. Oscar, who is obviously stricken with guilt as she sobs on the ground, still picks up the money and runs away. This moment, as small as it is, really shows Cabiria's biggest flaw and biggest endearment. Of course she doesn't care about money; she made that very clear. But in this scene, she outright dismisses it as nothing more than materialism, claiming that none of it mattered if she couldn't be happy. But she still hasn't addressed the fact that she's completely dependent on those around her to be happy.\n\nAt this point, the film is getting ready to end. Cabiria has been chewed up and spit out, left with no money and no home. There's only one way this film can end, right? She's standing at the top of a cliff, looking out into the world that never gives back. While she's looking beyond the horizon, let's flash back to an earlier scene: Cabiria is in a church, surrounded by hundreds of other lost souls looking for meaning and forgiveness. A crippled man prays to Madonna, asking to be healed and given a new way of life. Cabiria mimics the man, asking for some sort of guidance that will steer her life in a new direction.\n\nWe're back with Cabiria on the cliff, but she doesn't jump. She leaves and walks down a road, pouting and whimpering to herself. And then, to completely throw off the mood and melancholy orchestration, a group of locals pop out of nowhere and dance and sing alongside Cabiria. What a bunch of douchebags, right? Let Cabiria wallow in her sadness; anybody else would do the same thing. But Cabiria isn't mad, or frustrated, or anything of the sort. In fact, she starts to watch everyone. She turns her head left and right as they pass, and they come up to her and smile and offer their warmth. And Cabiria turns to the camera, looking right at you, and smiles. And suddenly you realize that all the shit wasn't for nothing. Not roadblocks, but building blocks; steps towards a life where the only person that can truly keep you happy is yourself. Alberto won't bring you out of the slums. Oscar won't make you love yourself. And God won't cure the crippled. You live with the hand you're dealt and you let it tear you apart. But you don't regret anything. You never, ever regret. You take it as it comes, and you use it. All emotions are useful, but optimism isn't an emotion. It's an idea that's fueled by hope. And while you can't always control your emotions, you can always hope for something better.\n\nRead more reviews at http://cinemabeans.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Federico Fellini has the sky falling in \"Nights of Cabiria\", around the dreams of a singular woman with threats to drown. It's also a weird tale of caution, parts seductive and elusive, Fellini often blurring the line. Albeit, there's one drawn, and \"Nights\" checks out both sides with equal promise and specificity. There's all the allure and lush glamour you've come to expect, with the tops of a brilliant mind in a would-be sudsy world. And here's Wanda Cabiria, smoke where there's flames by the superb Giuliette Masina, a hooker played as theoretical, fighting for the right to own her shame.\n   \nOf course, it doesn't come easy when even God's against you. Cabiria has eyes on a settled life, one she recreates with faux dates and friendships with that of fellow escorts, mainly a worn chick sketched by a great Franca Marzi. The dynamics are set to tumble. \"Nights of Cabiria\" might be Fellini's picture through and through -- it's the characters making his money, and who steal the show. They die trying to erase memories of their present when it isn't breathing down their necks, and something always is. \n\nFellini late in the game pulls from his book of tricks one of the oldest and well-traversed, a steamy magic that teaches the craft of spontaneity to climb past in order to take back your life. There's always down time on Cabiria's fast track, up to her to exploit. It's the clock once again that wheezes in the darkness of Fellini's boogie nights, and who, like a gifted mistress, steps over the bar when it's low.",

Such is the case with the positively glorious and devastatingly heartrending masterpiece about the tempestuous prostitute who breaks our hearts through the unexpected love transformation and that legendary walk at the end: the stuff movies legends are made of.

Perhaps this was Fellini's device in keeping the viewer sufficiently involved, but emotionally removed from the extreme tragedy of Cabiria's experience.  There is no resolution or happy ending here; but I suppose that is a suitable message about the life of prostitution. Hollywood made \"Pretty Woman;\" Fellini gave us true grit.",
