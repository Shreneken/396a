            "review_title": "3 Good Reasons To Watch This Film",
            "content": "There are three reasons that movie fans should check this film out, if you haven't seen it yet:1 - Outstanding dialog. I can't recall a film in which I heard so many clever film-noir lines as this one. Almost everyone in the movie has a unique way of expressing their feelings. It makes the movie one that you want to go back and HEAR again. Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman wrote the screenplay and deserve special recognition as well as the people below.2 - Fabulous acting, led by the two male leads: Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster. Curtis is the star of the film with many more lines than anyone else, and many consider this to be his greatest acting achievement. I have no quarrel with that. It's one of the finest acting jobs I've ever witnessed by anyone. It's that good. Lancaster is memorable and plays to his strengths as a tough guy, not only with his physical presence but his tactless and cutting verbal assaults. He has the best and most brutal lines in the film.The minor characters in here, from the cop to the comedian to the cigarette girl to the young romantic couple are all top-notch.3 - The cinematography. A big name in the film business, James Wong Howe, more than lives up to his reputation. This is beautifully photographed and looks absolutely stunning on DVD. I have watched hundreds and hundreds of black-and-white films and this ranks with the best of them. He captured nighttime New York City as well as anybody ever has done.\"Well,\" you might ask, \"if this movie is so great, why haven't I heard more about it?\"Maybe because it never did well at the box office. It wasn't promoted a lot, from what I heard, and the storyline is not a pleasant one. Basically, this is about two immoral people who smear a nice guy so that it will ruin the romance between he and Lancaster's sister. Lancaster plays an absolutely ruthless newspaper columnist who makes and breaks careers and Curtis plays his slimy press-agent who will do anything to please his powerful boss, including doing the worst of his dirty work.Furrther details of the film can be read by many of the other fine reviewers here on this website, so no need to go into that.I am not one who generally likes films that feature mostly nasty people but this was done so well that it fascinates me every time. A final tip of the hat to director Alexander Mackendrick. Why he wasn't given more films to direct is a mystery to me. Highly-recommended.",

            "content": "Tony Curtis learns the hard way about the \"Sweet Smell of Success\" in this 1957 film that stars Burt Lancaster, Sam Levene, Susan Harrison, and Barbara Nichols. In the pre-Internet days when the newspaper was king, the columnists ruled - Winchell, Ed Sullivan, Cholly Knickerbocker, Radie Harris, and let's not forget Hedda and Louella! But the King was Winchell, and while I don't think the Burt Lancaster character of J.J. Hunsecker is modeled on him, the power and control the man wielded certainly is.Tony Curtis plays one of his best roles as Sidney Falco, a low-ranking press agent who is dependent on people like Hunsecker to mention his clients in their daily columns. But Sidney is on the outs with Hunsecker, a very bad place to be. Hunsecker has ordered Sidney to break up his sister Susan's relationship with a jazz musician, Steve (Martin Milner), and Susan is still seeing him. Sidney comes up with a plan to tear the two apart which probably would have worked, but when Steve stands up to J.J., Hunsecker is out for blood. He demands the plan be taken one step further and dangles an attractive carrot in front of Sidney to make it happen.Done in black and white with most of the action taking place at night and often on the streets of Times Square, \"The Sweet Smell of Success\" has an atmosphere of slime and grit. The handsome Lancaster and Curtis are not particularly well photographed - it's not meant to be a glamorous picture. The dialogue is fast, to the point, and witty and the performances are breathtaking. Lancaster underplays the twisted Hunsecker so that his contempt for the people he writes about - and his sick attraction to his sister - can be clearly shown. He could have played it more along the lines of Curtis' Sidney - an obvious, manipulative rat - but it wouldn't have been as right as Lancaster's tightly-controlled J.J.Curtis was born to play Sidney - an attractive, fast-talking man with no morals who plays both ends against the middle. He's a New York character, ideal for a New York guy like Curtis who grew up on the streets. Sidney is totally outrageous - he invites a cigarette girl to his apartment and then pimps her out to a columnist so he can get an item in his column; he tries blackmailing another columnist, but that backfires. It doesn't stop him from trying again.The two victims of these piranhas are Susan and Steve, a young couple deeply in love who want to be married. Their simple story is told against a backdrop of scandal, revenge, manipulation and blackmail. Their situation makes the actions of J.J. and Sidney even seedier and more cruel than they already are.\"Sweet Smell of Success\" has become a cult classic and was actually mounted at one point as a Broadway musical. Like \"Nightmare Alley,\" it probably was too grim for audiences back then. Is anything too grim for audiences of today? Doubtful.",

            "content": "The fact that in 1957 this film was made at all is proof that Walter Winchell's decline was already setting in. Burt Lancaster's J.J. Hunsecker based on Winchell and very frightening accurately portrays the columnist and the power he wielded.For those who are interested in how Winchell got to where he was J.J. Hunsecker I would recommend Neal Gabler's biography of him which came out a few years ago. Sweet Smell of Success is the story of a day in the life of this monster who everyone on the planet it seems is terrified of offending. Like Winchell at the Stork Club, Hunsecker holds court like some monarch at a nightclub where people are obsequiously asking for some recognition in his column.One of these is Sidney Falco, press agent and bootlicking dog extraordinaire. Hunsecker is mad at him because he sent him on an errand to break up a romance his younger sister is having with a jazz musician he doesn't approve of. The film is essentially Falco's attempts to carry out his master's wishes.Burt Lancaster had already received critical acclaim as an actor, but this was a breakthrough role for Tony Curtis as Sidney Falco. Up to then Curtis was the handsome romantic lead in many lightweight films for his home studio of Universal. Sidney Falco was a lot of things, but heroic wasn't one of them. Next year Tony Curtis would get an Oscar nomination for The Defiant Ones. How Lancaster and Curtis were ignored by the Academy for nominations is beyond me.The young lovers are Susan Harrison and Martin Milner. This was probably Marty Milner's finest screen role. As Lancaster was also the producer he personally cast Milner in the part having worked with him on Gunfight at the OK Corral. Susan Harrison strangely enough never had much of a career after a promising debut. She ultimately wreaks a terrible vengeance on one of our protagonists.One of the ironic lines in the film is Lancaster saying that he'd fold up if he had to exist on a press agent's tidbits. But ironically that's how Winchell/Hunsecker did exist. Winchell had no real skill as a reporter as Gabler's biography pointed out. When the tidbits stopped, he dried up and blew away. Sweet Smell of Success was a commercial flop, movie audiences did not take to the offbeat casting of the leads nor to the gritty realistic story. Today the film is a deserved classic.",

            "content": "Remember how scary Robert Mitchum was in Night of the Hunter?  Or Darth Vader in the first Star Wars movie?  Well Burt Lancaster as J.J. Hunsecker is right up there with them.  With his clipped words, ice-cold gaze, rigid neck and steel-rimmed glasses, he looks like he's ready to break people in half with just the power of his voice.  He drifts through the film like an unstoppable barge, commanding every scene with just the turn of his head. Seldom is there such a powerful screen presence.Lancaster's performance alone is worth seeing this film, but the writing cracks like a whip.  This is some of the best writing I've ever seen in any film, recalling the brilliant writing of All About Eve or Citizen Kane: \"Come back Sidney, I want to chastise you some more\", \"turn around and look: is she still standing there?\", \"you're a cookie full of arsenic\", \"I see your brother's words coming out of your mouth like a ventriloquist's dummy\", \"I would never use an elephant gun to shoot a mosquito\".  Over and over, the witty dialogue slices through the scenes like a razor.  You have to see this film to believe it.Tony Curtis was never better as a sleazy PR guy as he pimps his secretary, slobbers at J.J.'s heels like an obsequious mutt, and colludes with the crooked cops to frame people.  Within this maelstrom of cynicism and anger are two young lovers, driven apart by J.J.'s overbearing presence. \nThe photography is excellent, you can almost smell the wet NYC streets. Black and white never looked better.This is an excellent film, and highly recommended.  I wish they still made movies like this.",

            "content": "BURT LANCASTER was at the height of his illustrious film career when he played J.J. Hunsecker, the Broadway gossip columnist who dipped his pen in poison to destroy careers. TONY CURTIS was a long way from the days when he was ridiculed for saying \"Yonda is the castle of my fadder\" in films like SON OF ALI BABA and THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH. Here, Curtis is every bit up to the chore of playing the slavishly obedient but hateful publicity man who seems to be fawning over Lancaster, but really despises him. Two towering performances in a film with some of the sharpest exchanges of dialog ever heard.The cruel side of show biz gets full and rich observation from screenwriter Clifford Odets from a novel by Ernest Lehman. The bright lights of Broadway play against the rainswept streets of Broadway and Times Square, a shadowy sort of film noir background for the brutal story being told.The story abounds in quotable moments, such as when Lancaster tells Curtis, \"You're a cookie full of arsenic.\" The jazz score background sets the appropriate mood for a story as cynical as this, and the twists and turns of the plot will keep you hooked until the uncertain ending. The main plot line has Lancaster opposed to his sister's suitor, a jazz musician (MARTIN MILNER) and his efforts to get this man out of his sister's life with the help of his obedient slave.But mainly, this is a film worth savoring to watch the intense performances of Lancaster and Curtis. I doubt whether either of them has ever done better work. For Lancaster, it only cemented his reputation as a man already judged to be a fine actor in the right role. For Curtis, it made film critics take this \"pretty boy from Brooklyn\" seriously for the first time and was the first big milestone in his budding film career.",

Great script, great cinematography, great acting, great music.  Christ, what do you want, blood? From the first moment we see Burt Lancaster as the impossibly sinister J.J., we know we're in for a cracking time.  There he is, sitting at the restaurant table, wearing those strangely scary glasses, his face expressionless (perhaps he's smiling, just a little bit), talking to Sidney without even looking at him, firing the dialogue like bullets.  When the action seeps into the New York streets, oozing menace, there's J.J. - master of all he surveys, twisting cops round his little finger, snarling and seething like some desperate animal.  And there is something animal about this film: its characters writhe and twist in the lights and the shadows - demented, tortured creatures, all of them trying to maintain some semblance of normality, all of them aware, deep down, how corrupt and helpless they are.  The symbols of goodness - J.J.'s sister and her boyfriend - are weak, pathetic, hopeless, unable to keep up with the neverending twists and turns of this awful labyrinth of manipulation and cruelty.  Curtis and Lancaster were never better, and it's awesome to see them play such grotesque yet believable roles.  How do people get like this?  Where do they go from here? Perhaps it's best not to think about it, and just wallow in the brilliant nastiness of it all, before maybe going home and getting in the shower for a long, long time.",

            "content": "Make no mistake \u0096 you will not walk away from Sweet Smell of Success feeling uplifted and carefree.  It is a dark, gritty tale of deception and the desperate strive for survival in New York City.  It also happens to be one of my all-time favorite films.*Spoilers within*Burt Lancaster plays J.J. Hunsecker, a powerful gossip columnist whose emulation of Walter Winchell was so thinly veiled that Winchell himself tried to stop the film's release.  Hunsecker is so powerful that underling press agents like Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) will push aside any scruples or morals they may have in order to do him favors just to get a favorable mention for their clients in Hunsecker's column.  In Falco's case, he must try to break up the relationship between Hunsecker's young sister Susan and up-and-coming jazz musician Steve Dallas, as Dallas is not `worthy' in Hunsecker's eyes.  It becomes quickly apparent that due to an almost incestuous fascination with his sister, no one will be worthy of her, something that Susan has to come to terms with and finally resign herself to.  In his pursuits, Falco finds himself compromising any moral fiber he may have had left, and no one escapes undamaged.Sweet Smell of Success is indeed a dark film and morally bereft, but it is so compelling and thought-provoking that it is hard to imagine any viewer, love or hate the film, not able to come away from it without at least a few questions in mind:  How far would you go for fame?  What would you do to survive?  The majority of the main characters has the morals of an alley cat, and is as unconcerned with doing anything for survival.  Ironically, one of the few people to exhibit any modicum of pride and conviction is the one who ends up getting slandered and unjustly punished.The backdrop for this film is the vibrant, busy and exuberant New York City, usually at night.  Every social scene is crowded; every outdoor shot shows bustling streets.  Wild, loud jazz music is the soundtrack the compliments the frenetic surroundings.  The film is shot in crisp, sharp black and white, and any hint of color would have changed the film drastically for the worse.  Lancaster plays Hunsecker as a level, even toned man which belies his hateful personality and only makes him more sinister.  Curtis' Falco is like the yipping and bouncing dog in the old cartoons, and delivers his lines with a machine gun-like staccato, but his eyes are dead and bleak, and the only emotion he can convey that approaches regret is nothing more than fleeting until `survival mode' visibly kicks in.Sweet Smell of Success is a certified classic, but it is easy to see why it is not more popular.  The good guys don't win because there ARE no good guys.  And every time the viewer thinks that something may not be realistic or that something is overblown, with even a second of reflection, one realizes that this IS real life, and it's hard to look at sometimes because it is not always pretty.--Shelly",

Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) was able to use various factors in the society he did his work in order to destroy any enemy, any adversary or any person whom he did not like at all. An example was the boy friend of his sister Susan, a working young man, devoted to music and strongly in love with Susan, completely discredited by JJ. Certainly JJ was a kind of a sick man, unable to accept any reason from any other person. He was born to have adversaries and not friends. To do all his work JJ needed snakes (not persons) as Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis), who behaved worse than a reptile, always praising JJ although he in fact hated him and creating the intrigues whenever there were necessary. Very good film and probably a lesson, the acting was also excellent, particularly of Lancaster as a tough columnist JJ and Tony Curtis as a low ethic man.",

            "content": "The main characters in \"Sweet Smell Of Success\" are two of the most unpleasant, unprincipled and unsympathetic people imaginable. Both are utterly corrupt and would do whatever it takes to achieve their own perverse ends.J J Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) is a gossip columnist who wields enormous power in New York and has the ability to make or break the careers of anyone who features in his articles. He plies his vicious trade without any concern for those whose lives he damages and frequently influences people to do his bidding by threatening to expose some unflattering or scandalous information about them. Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) is a press agent who makes his living by providing material for Hunsecker's column. When Hunsecker becomes unhappy about a relationship that has developed between his sister and a jazz guitarist, he orders Falco to do whatever's necessary to break them up. Hunsecker racks up the pressure on Falco by not accepting any of his contributions for the column until he succeeds in his mission.Hunsecker's power and threatening manner preclude him from having any genuine or meaningful relationships with other people. He is unconcerned about this but has an unnaturally close relationship with his sister, who on various occasions, he describes as being all that he's got.In his efforts to get a smear about the guitarist published, Falco threatens to blackmail one columnist by telling his wife about one of his indiscretions with a cigarette girl and also provides another columnist with an inducement to print the story by getting his girlfriend to prostitute herself. He later plants marijuana in the guitarist's pocket and tips off a corrupt police officer who has the guitarist arrested.Hunsecker thrives on the amount of power and control that he is able to use and it's ironic that he has such a hard time using his power successfully in the area of his life which is most personal and important to him.\"Sweet Smell Of Success\" is expertly directed by Alexander Mackendrick and the story and it's characters are considerably more original in nature than those found in the vast majority of movies. The dialogue is impressively incisive throughout and some of the remarks made by Hunsecker are delivered with great panache. When he says \"I love this dirty town\", the comment exemplifies what he's all about and also highlights the source of his power. His remarks that Falco is a \"cookie full of arsenic\" and \"lives in moral twilight\" are typical quick-fire put-downs. These and his \"40 faces speech\" could seem pretentious and contrived if uttered by some characters but sound perfectly credible when said by Hunsecker, who is clearly very literate and well practised in coining such bitter and brutal insults. Lancaster and Curtis both contribute exceptional performances which must rank among the greatest achieved in their illustrious careers.",

            "content": "**MILD SPOILERS** It is amazing the number of different ways a great film can weave its alluring web and pull you into its story. Of my 100 favorite films, this one's journey into that rarefied status is unique, based on but a single viewing. I saw \"Sweet Smell of Success\" when I was too young to really grasp the subterranean motivations of the characters who so vividly populate the film. I did not understand, for instance, why this powerful, loathsome gossip columnist, Burt Lancaster's JJ Hunsecker, who so clearly despised Tony Curtis' Sidney Falco (press agent), nonetheless tolerated his presence. There was much that I DID appreciate--the brilliant and daring acting of the two leads, the beautifully oppressive cinematography, and the scintillating dialogue--but after that single viewing, the film slowly faded from my consciousness. Twenty-five or 30 years later, I decided to make a list of my favorite movies, and came across the title of this film. Apparently, memories of seeing this production had been roiling around my unconscious all this time and now, triggered by the little blurb in the Leonard Maltin book, these half-forgotten images came bounding back into mind, now concatenated with a quarter century of life and movie-going experience. Honing my list over the next few months, and considering this film's merits, I more and more began to realize what a truly marvelous work this was. This was a study nonpareil of two creatures wholly wrapped up in themselves and their ambition, yet bound together in a mutual parasitism (the term symbiosis sounds much too nice to describe their relationship). I understood, finally, why JJ tolerated Falco's presence. He NEEDED Falco. It wasn't just that Falco would occasionally offer up tidbits that he could use in his column. It wasn't that the fawning Falco could be manipulated into performing certain . . . Uh, tasks that were too dirty for JJ to touch. No, as a ruthless power-monger, he needed the treacherous sycophant as a constant reminder and test of his superiority. Falco could be demeaned and ridiculed, but he also represented a danger, a challenge. Falco might seem a toady, but he was also a cobra waiting his chance to strike, and Hunsecker relished his role as sadistic snake charmer. Watching these two play at their oppressive games of perfidy, and dealing dirt, provide a fascinating character study perhaps the equal of the more famous examination of one Charles Foster Kane in an earlier film. There are many other characters in the movie, such as JJ's sister and her lover, and some are played with great aplomb, but they are all pawns in this disdainful dance between JJ and Falco, and it is their personalities that stay with you long after the lights come back on.Everything about this movie seems to be nearly perfect (some have criticised the film for the relatively weak portrayal of the two hapless lovers, but a stronger emphasis on these two would only detract from the real focus--JJ and Sidney) even to the choice of names. JJ Hunsecker and Sidney Falco seem perfect monikers, by themselves conjuring up images of loathsome characters. Unfortunately, for the team that put together this masterpiece of film-noir, \"Sweet Smell of Success\" was no success, and critics and movie-goers alike left the theaters convinced that the \"smell\" generated by the film was far from sweet. Amazingly, this film not only failed to garner an Oscar, it failed to receive a single solitary nomination--not for Alexander Mackendrick's direction (this abject failure truncating his promising career), not for the incisive, endlessly quotable screenplay (Ernest Lehman & Clifford Odets), not Elmer Bernstein's wonderful score, nor the tremendous performances of Curtis and Lancaster--not even James Wong Howe's gritty cinematography, beautifully capturing the seamier side of New York City. Fortunately, history has stepped in to provide a more accurate critique of this once ignored masterpiece. I can hardly wait to see it a second time.",

Here in \"Sweet Smell of Success\", however, he breaks with this and portrays a meaty and incredibly unlikable guy. The strength of this performance served to do something VERY difficult--to upstage Burt Lancaster--an actor who usually dominates the screen.Curtis plays a press agent--a very slimy and weak one who will do ANYTHING to make a buck and get into the good graces of people who can help him. In particularly, he hopes to get a cold and nasty columnist (Lancaster) to work with him--at any cost. Lancaster's character seems as if it's based on Walter Winchell--a real life columnist who used to wield tons of power but who, according to most accounts, was a vicious and power-hungry jerk. Watching Lancaster's character so coldly and callously manipulate those around him was great--almost as captivating as the depths to which Curtis would go to debase himself. They made a very compelling and slimy team--hateful but something you just can't stop watching. As for the rest of the cast, they do a fine job but they are way off in the background--it is a Curtis-Lancaster film and they dominate the picture.So why did I give the film a 10 Well, first, it's very original and gusty--very different from the nice image of stars and those who make them. You see an ugly side--like watching people bathing in a sewer. And it's unforgettable and relies solely on excellent writing, acting and direction. Sets and plot devices are irrelevant--just darn fine work by the priniciples involved.So why didn't it win anything at Oscar time or get nominated?! Well, first, I think it was a film that slowly caught on and many people also just didn't know what to think of this anti-Hollywood and anti-Broadway film. Second, 1958 was an amazingly good year in films and all but one of the Best Picture nominees were amazing films. Whether or not they were better or worse than \"Sweet Smell of Success\" is debatable but they almost all were terrific films--\"Bridge on the Rive Kwai\", \"12 Angry Men\", \"Sayonara\" and \"Witness for the Prosecution\" were all up for the big award (how \"Peyton Place\", a very glossy soap opera, got nominated is beyond me).

There is hardly a non-greedy guy in the movie, although the three women are all okay.But here we have Burt Lancaster as the all-powerful columnist J. J. Hunsacker (read \"Walter Winchell\") and Tony Curtis as the slimy press agent Sidney Falco and Emil Meyer as the brutal and corrupt cop, supported by one columnist who cheats on his wife with a cigarette girl and another columnist who simply does the cigarette girl without cheating on any wife because he has none to cheat on. These are people who treat virtue with scant reverence.There's a loud jazzy score to back up this energetic night-time flick. (There is no such thing as daylight here.) And Clifford Odets has lent his usual stamp to the script. Nobody says anything as simple as, \"I don't believe you.\" They are made to say, \"That fish is four days old. I won't buy it.\" And the sweating laugh-a-minute cop is given to misusing big words -- \"Rectify me something, Sidney, did J. J. really say I was fat?\" Even when the cop uses the word correctly it still SOUNDS wrong -- \"Ha ha! Come back, Sidney, I want to CHASTISE you.\" The dialog is also studded with everyday phrases that are repeated as if part of a litany -- \"credit where credit is due.\" And, \"indulge me on this,\" and, \"correct me if I'm wrong.\" The best of this dialog is given to the evildoers, meaning every guy except Curtis's uncle (Sam Levene, underused in my opinion) and Martin Milner as an innocent young jazz guitarist afloat in this sea of sharks. \"You twist words around,\" he says, addressing another actor, not Odets. This movie is, by the way, some considerable distance from the director's (Alexander MacKendrick) usual stomping ground. (Cf., \"Tight Little Island.\")Burt Lancaster gives a quiet, barely restrained performance as the gossip columnist and TV personality who tells presidents what to do. He's so tense with ego, power, anger, and an incestuous jealousy of any attention paid to his sister that he gives the impression of a boil about to burst. But he rarely loses it. Instead, if he shows any semblance of emotion at all, it's usually pleasure in the exercise of power accompanied by a reptilian, almost alligator-like smile of beneficence. It's a good performance, and so is Tony Curtis's. Nattily dressed in black suits, his hair flawlessly groomed, his expression alternating between a phony bonhomie and greasy anxiety, he seems always to be in motion, darting rather than walking, and talking almost always, usually lying. Barbara Nichols as the careless and exploited cigarette girl plays Barbara Nichols. I have no idea what she was like in person but on screen she's never been anyone else. And as someone once remarked about the adolescent AnnMargaret -- \"Everything she does comes across as dirty.\" Martin Milner looks right but mumbles his way through the part without much conviction. Burt's sister is a washout.What a splendid photographer James Wong Howe was. His blacks are really black, his highlights seem to glisten, and when Lancaster's mogul stands on his balcony staring down at his domain from on high, the streets of New York look like rivulets of glittering silver poured from a beaker. Compare this with the subtle, crisp grays of his Texas ranch in \"Hud.\"The movie gives us a glimpse of the sizzling New York City night life of the 1950s. It may have looked corrupt at the time but from our present perspective it was an age of innocence. Well-dressed people walk alone down deserted streets at night. You want to try that in today's New York? Maybe the greatest change since then is suggested by the puissance in the hands of a newspaper columnist -- a guy who writes words that people must then read. Read? Who gets their news from newspapers nowadays? Who would be shocked by the revelations Lancaster and his colleagues in gossip come up with -- an unknown musician who is said to have smoked marijuana and is fired because of the slur? Today it would lead to hemorrhage-inducing mirth. So it might have been rotten then, true, but there are times when it seems to me that it would be nice to listen to the hoof beats of yesteryear and travel back in time to a period when people still read and when one of the worst lies you might run into in the news was that a musician did some grass.",

Oh, well.\"Sweet Smell of Success\" is a great, wildly entertaining movie. It reminds me of \"Dangerous Liasons\" in both it's subject (\"bad\" people making life worse for more decent folk) and how swiftly and imaginatively directed it is. It's juicy from beginning to end. Burt Lancaster is once again terrific as J.J. Hunsecker, Walter Winchell-esque writer of a \"society\" column which is more of a tool of destruction for those who cross his path. But it's Tony Curtis who holds the movie together. Always scheming and plotting and never letting a decent human emotion take precedence over his drive to succeed at any cost. He's Marvelous and was never again to achieve what he did here.But there's a third star to this production and it's New York City itself. The on location photography is stunning. What is amazing is that at the time the movie was made (1957) on location filming was just becoming \"in vogue\". For a film like this, it HAD to filmed on location or else it's power would be substantially diluted. I work in Manhattan near where a lot of this film was made (J.J. lives in the Brill Building which is on Broadway between 49th and 50th Streets, right around the corner from me). To see what the neighborhood looked like over 40 years ago is amazing. Surprisingly, it's the astonishing on site photography that prevents the film from really feeling dated. Also, the themes in the film are timeless as well.\"Sweet Smell of Success\" is a classic from top to bottom.",

            "content": "Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster play against type in this unapologetically but delightfully nasty film about the desire to be \"known\" in the New York social scene, and the lengths to which people will go, or the depths to which they will sink, to achieve fame.It's rare to come across such a blisteringly pessimistic film as this one, even today. Lancaster gives one of the best performances of his career as J.J. Hunsecker, gossip columnist to NY's social elite, who lurks in dark corners of exclusive restaurants like a bird of prey waiting to pounce on those weaker than him. He can make or break a career with a few words put to paper, and he doesn't insist that the words be true. Tony Curtis plays slimy loser Sidney Falco, who desperately wants to be somebody, and jumps to J.J.'s commands like a circus animal. Together, these two prowl the grimy, shadowy streets of a nightmare version of the Big Apple, creating a vision more steeped in film noir than the most noirish detective movie. Accusations of Communist sympathies are made, while Hunsecker reveals an unnatural fondness for his sister. All of this is set to a discordant and jazzy score that's like the aural version of neon signs.You could fill a book with the quotable lines from this film. My favorite.....\"That fish is four days old, and I ain't buyin' it.\" Or the ever classic \"I'd hate to take a bite out of you. You're a cookie full of arsenic.\" Indeed, the movie is a cookie full of arsenic -- bitter at its center, but so damn sweet and enjoyable.Grade: A+",

            "content": "Burt Lancaster is a ruthless newspaper columnist, J.J. Hunsecker, and Tony Curtis is press agent Sidney Falco who needs his clients featured in Hunsecker's column. The film starts with Falco trying to get in touch with Hunsecker who has refused to feature any news about Falco's clients for the past month. As a result, Falco's clients are upsetting and firing him left and right. He needs to get back in Hunsecker's good graces. It turns out that Hunsecker wanted Falco to break up the romance between his sister, Susan Hunsecker, and Steve Dallas, a local jazz musician. Falco failed in his first attempt to break them up, thus Hunsecker is punishing him. Hunsecker gives Falco one more chance to break up Susan and Dallas. Falco decides to plant a false rumor in a competing column as a means to hurt Dallas' reputation. Then Hunsecker will defend Dallas in his column, in which Dallas will dismiss Hunsecker's attempts to smooth things over and in effect, he will look bad to girlfriend, Susan. That's the plan anyway... First thing. I loved the music in this movie. It was great rowdy, raunchy jazz music that I love and it fit the aesthetic and the mood of the film perfectly. I also loved the cinematography in this film. I thought the black and white looked great. I also liked how some characters would be presented in an extreme close-up, but also at an angle. There's a shot like this of Falco in the beginning. I think it is supposed to symbolize this character's corruption and uneasiness. Extreme closeups can be somewhat uncomfortable for the audience (at least for me anyway, it almost seems a bit claustrophobic, if that makes sense). I also loved the New York settings. In addition to the music and camera work, I thought Curtis and Lancaster were excellent in their roles. While I didn't dig Lancaster's crew cut, I thought it worked well for his character who seems like he's pretty much all business all the time. He kind of had a Hank Hill thing going on in this movie--but of course, he's smarter and more shrewd than Hank Hill could ever be. I also really liked Curtis in this movie. Before I kind of dismissed him as a big of a lightweight actor (though I do really like him in Some Like it Hot), but this film demonstrated that he was adept at drama. I thought he was great as Falco, the agent who would stop at nothing to be successful. I didn't care much for the actress who played Susan. She wasn't bad, but I didn't like how she talked. She ov-er e-nun-ci-ate-d her words. I thought this was a great film.",

Go ahead and say it to  yourself, and I'll say that David Mamet's Glengarry, Glen Ross comes  close. Both feature snarling, biting dialog. Both have irredeemable  characters that will do anything for success. Mamet's characters are  mostly down-and-outers who are scrapping at each other to find some  sampling of their former successes. In Sweet Smell of Success there are  successful characters and losers, both of which need each other to  survive. It is a tale of a successful columnist and his need for a low  life press agent. It is a bitter, bleak story of power, success and the  desire to have more.  Burt Lancaster plays JJ Hunsecker, a powerful, successful columnist who  is at the top of his game. He gets what he wants, when he wants it with  no questions asked. He can make or break celebrities with a quick blurb  in his column. He dines with politicians and gets any girl he wants.  Tony Curtis is Sidney Falco, a low rent press agent who needs  Lancaster's blurbs for his clients to keep in business. Problem is,  Hunsecker has cut Falco out of his columns because Falco hasn't  delivered on a deal they made. Though Hunsecker can garner the love and  admiration of anyone he chooses, the one woman he cannot win over is  his own sister. As he repeatedly says throughout the film, she's all he  has. Problem is she is in love with a jazz singer, and they plan to  marry. Hunsecker can't bear the thought of losing his sister, so he  forces Falco to get rid of the boy by any means necessary.  The film is relentless. From beginning to end it never stops its  pounding. There is never a breath of kindness. The two characters with  some redeeming characteristics Hunsecker's sister, Susan (Susan  Harrison) and her boyfriend, Steve Dallas (Martin Milner), are so  overshadowed by the continual foul play by Hunsecker and Falco that  they come away with a foul stench.  Tony Curtis pulls a performance that reminded me of his turn as the  Boston Strangler. It is not difficult to see his Falco turning to  murder if it helped him succeed. Though as the strangler, he seems to  have found some remorse for his actions, where Falco is irredeemable to  the very end.  There is a seen in the middle of the picture where Falco pulls a trick  to convince a mid level performer to make Falco his press agent. At  this point Falco needs all the clients he can get. Later the performer  comes to Falco, ready to sign him as his agent. Falco, now feeling some  signs of success brushes the performer off without a second thought. It  is a telling scene of just how heartless and uncaring Falco has become.  Where has Burt Lancaster been all my life? Sadly enough, the only film  I can remember watching him in is the 1986 toss-off comedy Tough Guys.  His performance here is nothing short of astonishing. He is the king of  his castle, never stepping off his high throne, treating everyone as  servants. Even his shows of affection for Susan are grotesque and  menacing.  This is a story that his hard to watch. It is brutal, and menacing with  nary a redeeming aspect. But it is a film that must be watched. The  craftsmanship of the filmmakers and the performances of the actors  elevate it above so many others. It is nearly a morality tale of the  horrors that befall humanities greed.",

            "content": "In its April 2000 issue, \"Vanity Fair\" ran a brilliant article by Sam Kashner about the making of the film, \"A Movie Marked Danger\". Kashner's research was deep and it cut deep. The story and the characters behind the camera were just as intriguing as the ones in front. I kept that issue for years.\"Sweet Smell of Success\" tells the story of how powerful Columnist, J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) uses toadying press agent, Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis), to try and wreck the affair his sister is having with a musician.Many people have noted that Hunsecker was based on influential columnist, Walter Winchell, but it went deeper than that. According to Kashner's article, Hunsecker's smothering relationship with his sister paralleled Winchell's wrecking of a relationship his daughter had with a producer. No wonder Winchell wanted to stop the movie being made.The making of it was also fraught for Ernest Lehman who had been a press agent feeding gossip to Winchell and other columnists. However he hated himself for doing it. As part of his redemption he penned a story based on his experiences that became the basis of the screenplay.Kashner, who was given rare insights into the film by Lehman and Tony Curtis, went on to detail how Burt Lancaster's company became involved, and how Lancaster was an intimidating presence for Lehman as he attempted to write the first screenplay. Eventually the stress got to Lehman and his doctors virtually ordered him to leave the project. Two of the producers were so enraged they reportedly said in unison \"I hope the SOB dies\" A dangerous movie indeed, and the cameras had hardly started rolling.Lehman's departure ushered in Clifford Odets, the writer who once had five plays running simultaneously in New York. That's when the dialogue took on the distinctive passages that mark the film. When British director Alexander Mackendrick was worried that they sounded exaggerated, Odets reassured him: \"Play it real fast - play the scenes for the situations! Play them 'on the run' and they'll work just fine\".The other great contributor to the film's brilliance was Mackendrick. However it was just about his last movie. Like Lehman, after dealing with Burt and co., he'd had enough; he later became a highly-regarded teacher at the California Institute of the Arts.Kashner gave background on each of the stars, but one seemed particularly enigmatic, Susan Harrison. He claimed she had problems and disappeared from the Hollywood scene a few years after the film was made and could not be located.She hadn't totally disappeared though, it appears she opted out of Hollywood to raise a family. She actually gave a 2011 interview about the making of the movie where she said it had been particularly democratic on set with opinions welcomed. Fascinating! She died in 2019, the last of the principals involved in the film.For those who love the film or even for those who don't, Sam Kashner's \"Vanity Fair\" article is full of revelations and makes compelling reading. At the time of writing, it can still be found online.",

J.J. Hunsecker reminds me of a glowing radioactive ball of plutonium, terrible in its simple existence. He can make or break you with a single word, and everyone knows he can and will without a single look back. The film captures perfectly the smoky nightclub world of 21 and the Stork Club along with the grubby little burrow belonging to Sidney Falco, press agent and repellent social climber.

We see the creatures that populate this dark aberration of society, polite or otherwise.One of the creatures inhabiting this Eco system is Press Agent Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis). Immediately we see him as a manic personality, living in the bars and clubs all around the Broadway Theatrical District. He is ever running, telephoning or kibitzing with clients and potential clients. His small, sort of shabby office has a bedroom set up in order for him to crash, or whatever else requires the use of a bed.As it seems obvious, he apparently also lives there. Sidney needs to stay in the good graces of the big, newspaper columnists, like the top guy, J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancester). It is columnists like him who \"use\" the little items in their columns, which they receive from the Press Agents. The more items from Sidney, the greater is his asking price from clients.Mr. Hunsecker has acquired more power over those in the entertainment field than one could believe. He holds figurative powers of life and death over the various numbers of actors, singers, dancers, musicians and comedians. A good word from his column is viewed as a blessing by any producer as a panning o the very same show would hurt it grievously.However as we soon see, his megalomania is not limited to his show biz reporting and gossip in the printed page. He has a young sister, Susan (Susan Hucksetter) of whom he maintains an iron grip on her life; having a compulsion to \"protect\" her from any outside influences, be the business or social.When Susan falls for musician, Steve Dallas (Martin Milner), J.J. pulls out all stops in attempting to break up the young couple. He has a direct meeting, where he insinuates that it would not be good his career if he didn't break off the relationship. Things didn't work out with that little chat, so J.J. gave the job of discrediting Steve to Sidney Falco, once again.The finale features the use of a crooked and brutal Police Lieutenant and the use of planting false evidence. Much like MOBY DICK, the story ends with a lot still going on, a sure indication that the author believes there to be no relief from such situations.The story is woven in such a manner as to never seem to be to long or to be dragging. The Director and cinematographer, Alexander Mackendrick and James Wong Howe respectively, gave the film a real up-close and personal feel to it. They make the viewer surrender himself and accept all sorts of bizarre behaviour.There has been many a claim that the Story and Character of J.J. Hudsecker, while fictional and emphatically so stated, is really based on Walter Winchell, who was top-dog in the Broadway & Show Biz Columnist business. Others have pointed to Alexander Woollcott. Our guess is that the author used bits and pieces of many real life folks; as well as blending in a heaping portion of embellishment, for good measure.Our Recommendation: Definitely see it. Just make sure you're in the proper frame of mind as the overall mood of the film is a definitely a downer.",

But much like the Ida Lupino/Humphrey Bogart flick \"They Drive by Night\" which is about a bunch of truck drivers, this seemingly mundane story packs a lot of power, suspense, intrigue and thrills. Backed by great acting and excellent cinematography, this flick is definitely worth 96 mins of your time.Charming, fast-talking, \"ice cream faced\" Tony Curtis plays Sidney Falco, an unscrupulous press agent who would pimp his own grandmother if it furthered his career. On the other end of the spectrum, monotonous, cruel, stone faced Burt Lancaster plays \"J.J. Hunsecker\" a sort of diabolical Mephistopheles character, except that he would make Mephistopheles quake in his hotboots. J.J. is a feared newspaper columnist who runs the town with his cunning propaganda, spouting righteous venom all for the purpose of making himself a god.So rather than having a typical goodguy-badguy, protagonist-antagonist story, here we have 2 antagonists: two self-serving sleazebags who are essentially the same except that one scurries around in dark alleys while the other towers above in his penthouse. The plot revolves around J.J.'s dark obsession with breaking up his sister's romance, and to do this he employs the questionable methods of Sidney. I said that there's no real protagonist, but Sidney fits the role as someone we associate and sympathize with, and the question we explore is how low Sidney will sink in this Faustian tale. He is a scumbag, but we sense that there is just enough humanity left in him that he may be able to redeem himself. Will he? Watch the movie.",

            "content": "This highly quotable film noir is quite different than any other, before or sense. This deals with the darkness inside so-called respectable people, so true right the stories that keep the public intrigued over their bacon and eggs. Columnist JJ Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) makes and breaks careers through his goosequill dipped in venom, and he can be more vicious than the killers and thieves and con artists that dominated most of this genre from its earliest beginnings. The only difference, is that he gets a check for what he does, and there is no law against his amoral ways of getting the scoop. But with a man as immoral as him, there are also a lot of people that go down thanks to his dirty dealings, and here, an ambitious press agent (Tony Curtis) willingly gives up his soul so he can use JJ's influence to make it as a Broadway big shot.The story here, however is a personal one, showing a tender side of JJ that has sinister motives. Obsessed with his much younger sister (Susan Harrison) in a borderline incestuous way, JJ greatly opposes her involvement with musician Martin Milner and uses Curtis to sabotage the relationship any way he can. The grittiness of the New York streets (perfectly represented with James Wong Howe's stunning black and white photography) and a brilliant jazzy score by Elmer Bernstein (emulated by Marvin Hamlisch for the 2001 Broadway musical version) are technical highlights that will have you checking out every physical detail of the film outside the script, acting and direction.The wonderful Barbara Nichols is simply outstanding as a cocktail waitress with a heart of gold exploited by Curtis and forced into a seeming act of prostitution with client David White. Jeff Donnell, as Curtis's secretary who has her desk outside his bedroom, makes the most of her brief appearance at the beginning, having a breakdown that made me want to see more of this pathetic character. Edith Atwater, as Lancaster's no-nonsense secretary, gets to be quite a bit tougher than the other women and get some of the film's best lines. This shows the desperation of humanity in many different aspects, from ruthless ambition to the determination to control to the fragility of the human heart. It is a film that will have you riveted from beginning until end, and has stood the test of time and showing a society is that has gotten more complicated with the increase of various media outlets past just newspapers and the evening network news.",

The sense of location and period is really strong - sleazy and vibrant.Sadly, the characterisation is a let-down. The press agent's situation doesn't make sense: he operates out of an office with a bedroom in back, yet he has a secretary, yet he's down to his last cent, yet he has the trust of a powerful man, yet he can't cover the simplest jobs, yet he's got everything it takes to succeed in a dirty business. Confusing. And he starts off sleazy, carries on being sleazy, and gets a bit of cheap redemption in the end. He is the main character, so everything flows from that, and it's all a bit off.The other problem is the highly mannered dialogue - hard bitten, sometimes obscure, never believable. The actors do deliver it well - but I ain't buying it, see? The columnist is an interesting character, but the lovers are pretty plain, and in the end we just get a jerky old melodrama with nothing true about it.The one part I did enjoy was the subplot with the stage comedian, where the hero's nerve and trickery shone through. So, although impressed with the atmospherics, I was left cold by the rest of the story.My guess is this movie's reputation really rests on the surprise of Lancaster's performance. Overall: big production built on a flawed screenplay.Ps. I've read the screenwriter was drafted in very late, and ended up ripping fresh pages out of his typewriter on shooting days. Lancaster was not happy.",

            "content": "Sidney Falco is a press agent. His livelihood depends on him getting coverage for his clients with influential newspaper columnists. The most influential is JJ Hunsecker and Falco would do anything to get in his good books. Currently he is trying to break up the relationship of Hunsecker's sister with a jazz guitarist that Hunsecker doesn't like. This leads to a Machiavellian plot and profound repercussions. Superb. Incredibly clever and complex plot - Falco and Hunsecker's scheming is something to behold. Quite Shakespearean in the planning, the knock-on effects and how innocent people get sucked in and affected by the plan. Incredibly enthralling as you get pulled into a very realistic cut-throat world where nothing gets done without a quid pro quo, kindness is a rarity and there seems no escape from the influence of the main protagonists.Quite engaging - you feel for the characters and your loyalties change as the facts change and people reveal their true selves through their actions. The movie is rounded off by an excellent performance by Burt Lancaster as JJ Hunsecker. He's a manipulative, unscrupulous villain in a suit and revels in the role. Genuinely scary.",

            "content": "This movie apparently had only moderate success when it was released 50 years ago - presumably due to its film noir character, with the iconic Lancaster and the rising young matin\u00e9e idol, Curtis, both very unctuous, and one seeming smarmier than the other at every turn. Lancaster is so selfish, ego-maniacal and unfeeling - except for his obsession with his sister (and even that unhealthy and self-serving, having turned her into a basket case). Curtis is just as bad in terms of his character; he just doesn't have the power or influence of Lancaster's \"J. J.,\" but is trying hard to acquire it. Viewed now, this film is not only superb drama with two of the greatest stars in Hollywood history. It is also a relic in the sense of conveying the influence of gossip columnists in that period and the preceding decades - Winchell, Earl Wilson, Ed Sullivan, Sheila Graham, Hopper and Parsons in Hollwood, and usually a comparable columnist for more local tidbits in almost every American newspaper. These have for many years been supplanted by the plethora of \"gossip\" programs on the wide spectrum of cable/satellite channels today.There are some details in this film which can be criticized, but these only make its \"10 stars\" just a little dimmer. Even with his hand-to-mouth status in the film, Curtis' Sidney would at least have a better sign on his \"office\" door, and something a tad more office-like. Martin Milner looks as though he's consumed about a triple dosage of tranquilizers, and for most of the picture, so does Susan Harrison; if J. J. were to have a legitimate beef about Marty's attentions to his sister, it should have been his apparent furnishing her with \"downers.\" If you have seen \"The Caine Mutiny,\" released three years prior, you'll recall the young lovers in that film, Robert Francis and May Wynn. It would be a a dead-heat tie with the pair in this film for the title of the most insipid young couple in filmdom history.However, this fact works in this film, to point even more emphasis towards Lancaster/J. J. and Curtis/Sidney. Likewise for the rather one-dimensional character to all the supporting parts and cast. The fore-mentioned \"noir\" quality and the rather over-the-top acting of the two leads is a nostalgic look at the acting styles from \"The Jazz Singer\" through the '50's {nobody - but nobody - was more \"over-the-top\" in style (or greater) than the pioneering Al Jolson}.This movie, like so many classics of its period, is great to view, in its own right - but doubly so as an historic, nostalgic view of a time past.",

The king of the thinking mans cinema. Has better dialogue ever been written, the meetings between all the different characters that inhabit this world of shadows and intrigue, constantly draw the viewers attention to this masterpiece. When the so called film buffs compile there lists of the \"best\" films and so on, this should always be talked of in the top five and yet though recognised more as the years go by this is still a highly overlooked film. That Marlon Brando, De niro, Nicholson and the like should be recognised so often in said lists when Burt Lancaster in this film and in so many others has equalled or surpassed there best performances is a real scandal. Perhaps because this film strikes at the very heart of the establishment and shows the media and press up for the unscrupulous scum they are that this is one those fellows would like to forget. It is always difficult to look the truth of oneself in the mirror and this is one mirror the media should look very closely at. A masterpiece from Lancaster, who's courage never failed when making films and was always ready to tackle the kind of film making that lesser men would not have dared to, not to mention casting himself in a \"bad guy\" role that defied his heroic, handsome leading man status. Let us not forget that this is the same man who through out his life was never afraid to speak out on subjects that were important to him, a life long liberal and contemptuous of anyone who excepted limitation. I love this film and both Lancaster and the picture were far ahead of their time.",

            "content": "This film is way over the top in every department, with only a few redeeming features, notably its photography, plus a few good actors in small roles, especially Sam Levene and Emile Meyer. The story concerns a soulless press-agent who seeks to curry favor with a powerful, corrupt Walter Winchell-like gossip columnist. Every twist and turn of the plot is telegraphed well in advance, and the machinations of the various players are out of a Victorian melodrama. What makes the movie wretched is that it, or rather those responsible for it, are so damned pleased with themselves. The atmosphere is fifties-edgy; everyone seems to be either on speed or caffeine overload. Most of the people speak to each other in little arias, expressing either self-interest, a contempt for others, or both, these always underlined by a sense of moral irony inconsistent with the characters in question. The movie is like a tabloid, always ripping the lid off this or that, telling us either what we already know or don't care to find out about various hot topics of the time. As a character study it doesn't work because the bad guy is so amoral that he is a monster pure and simple. We never get to know him because there's only one thing about him that matters, his willingness to destroy and humiliate those who won't do his bidding. If he has friends or a personal life they are not shown. He does not seem like a human being and Burt Lancaster plays him as not like a human being. Tony Curtis, as the toady of the moment, is more credible, but all we learn about him is how ambitious he is and how much he wants to be like his idol and chief torturer. No one else, not even Lancaster's (much) younger sister, really matters. In comparison one can imagine the Nazi high command as vastly more charming and magnanimous than the characters in this picture. The film barrels along at about 200 mph and is certainly never boring, but it isn't moving, either. New York at night never looked more menacing. Nor is it ever, for an instant, attractive, as it is strangely unseductive, and overall disgusting, like a bad piece of corned beef stuck in the back of the throat. In the end the picture itself seems sleazier than those people whose souls, or lack thereof, it is purporting to expose, and it left a bad taste.",

            "content": "I missed this film when it first came out (when I was in my late teens) \u0096 and I kept missing it whenever it appeared on TV, which was a rare occasion. So, I was very pleased to finally get a DVD and relish in one of the definitive stories about...power and how it corrupts.Arguably, this narrative is a true classic and ranks as one of the best dramas ever put to film. First, the two main actors \u0096 Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster \u0096 both give truly outstanding performances. Curtis went on to other projects like The Defiant Ones (1958), Some like it hot (1959) and most notably The Boston Strangler (1968); but, as Sidney Falco, he's the quintessential slime ball, the guy whom you really never want to meet because he's the one you know you can never trust. He makes Paul Newman's Hud (1963) look like Mr Goody Two Shoes, and that's no criticism of Paul Newman. Curtis's acting is so good, he should have won an Oscar.Lancaster is also excellent in the role of a power-corrupted syndicated columnist, J.J. Hunsecker, who'll use whatever and whomever to protect his interests \u0096 and in this slice of slimy life, it's his sister who forms the central interest. That by itself makes for a gripping tug of war between him and a very effective and young Martin Milner as Steve Dallas, the guitarist who wants to marry Susan Hunsecker, played by Susan Harrison (an actor who faded away very quickly, it seems). What's more interesting, however, is the interaction between J.J. and Susan, with distinctive allusions to a brother-sister relationship that seems to go a bit beyond normality; with a longer narrative that could have been explored more, and to great effect, I think.What's even more interesting is the unspoken undercurrent between J.J and Sidney, both handsome guys, one dominant, one submissive, both dependent upon each other, both repulsed by each other \u0096 and probably themselves, deep down. And both always on the make for the next conquest, including sexual.However, in 1957, to extend both of those aspects into this story probably would have ensured an even faster death at the box office...In addition to the acting, the other big strength is the dialog that contains some of the best one-liners in movie history. Check out the Quotes section to gain an appreciation of the quality of this script. For sheer use of word power and word play, you have to look at Sleuth (1972) for comparison, a lesser film, sure, but still entertaining.The production was top-notch as was the cinematography from James Wong Howe, an operator who started out in the silent era, in 1920. And, it shows. Looking over his credits, I spotted a half dozen movies that I rate among my favorites, particularly Pursued (1947), the very best black and white photography I've ever seen. And of course, the mise-en-scene: New York, as few have seen it, and which is gone forever. Like On the Waterfront (1952), The Naked City (1948) and a few others, that gritty city is The Metaphor for the tough grittiness that seems to permeate the citizens of that great place \u0096 good and bad alike.It's not surprising that the critics and the public, at that time, shunned this masterpiece: nobody likes to look inside their soul to shrink back from the truth. None of us like to think what we might do or not do in the same situation; it's too much for most to even acknowledge that old saying: there but for the grace of God, go I.Unquestionably, one of the best movies I've ever seen.",

            "content": "****SPOILERS**** Realistic movie about a powerful and ruthless New York city gossip columnist J.J Hunsecker, Burt Lancaster, and how he treats people who dare to sand in his way. With Tony Curtis giving the best acting performance of his career as the sleazy and manipulating Sidney Falco a local publicist who's very existence depends on J.J giving print to the people who he represents in his column. Falco being iced out of the J.J Hunsecker gossip column, which is the death penalty in the newspaper world for a publicist, because of him failing to break up the relationship between J.J's kid sister Susie, Susan Harrison, with the up and coming popular guitar player Steve Dallas, Martin Milner, of the Chico Hamilton Quintet.Trying to get back into the good graces of J.J Falco gives a competing gossip columnist Otis Elwell, David White, a hot story to print about Steve being a pot smoker as well as card carrying commie! This can not only ruin Steve's but the Chico Hamilton Quintet's careers. Even though J.J could have done a much more effective job of destroying Steve he and Falco manipulated Ewell to do their dirty work in order not to have Susie suspect that it was her brother who is breaking up their relationship as well as their future marriage. When J.J with the connivance of Falco invited Steve and his manager Frank D'Angelo, Sam Levene, and Susie to the TV studio where J.J, with Falco in attendance, all hell breaks loose. J.J is to talk about the the rights of Americans not to be trampled on with false and unsubstantiated accusations, like what J.J was doing to Steve. This is for J.J to show those in the audience as well as the shows some 60 million TV viewers how he took the high road in the Steve Dallas case of \"Guilt by Gossip\". Steve seeing through J.J's and Falco's scam and at the same time having too much pride and dignity to play along with their squalid game let J.J have it, verbally. This shakes up the normally cool as a cucumber J.J to the point where he really lost his cool and embarrassed himself in front of every one there. Furious J.J, after that spectacle, not only wanted to destroy Steve's career but also his life! He then had Falco plant a pack of joints in Steve's coat at the nightclub where he was preforming and then tipping off the brutal and vicious Lt. Harry Kello, Emile Meyers, to not only arrest him but work him over. Susie who agreed to break up with Steve after J.J browbeat her into submission at the TV studios and left her with an emotional breakdown heard the news about what happened to Steve. Going to the hospital Susie found out at that Syeve may not pull out of his coma from the beating that Kello gave him. Later as Falco came up to J.J's apartment, to give him the good news about Steve, that he pulled out of his coma but suffered permanent brain damage, he saved Susie's life as she tried to kill herself by jumping off the balcony. J.J coming into the room and seeing his sister in a nightgown and in the arms of Falco, who was holding her in order for her not to jump out the window and kill herself, went wild. Slapping Falco around an outraged J.J then called the police and Lt. Kello to come over and arrest Falco for planting pot on Steve; which J.J himself had Falco do. Falco running from the building is cornered by Lt.Kello and savagely beaten and arrested but Susie who knew that it was her brother J.J who was behind Steve's brutal beating, and everything else that was done to break Steve and her up, walks out on him as the movie ended. Razor sharp black & white photography as well as dialog gave \"Sweet Smell of Success\" that real New York city look of the 1950's. The stunning on location filming makes the movie a must for those of us who appreciate the \"Big Apple\" as it was back then before it became a cheap imitation of what it is now. That's before the explosion of the real estate market in the mid 1970's made the city look like the nondescript and undistinguished town that it is today. Instead of the great Majestic Metropolis by the rivers, the Hudson an East, that it was back then.",

            "content": "Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster were two incredible actors, and both of them make up the two most important characters of this movie. This is a film which benefits greatly from its cast, because it probably wouldn't be rated as highly if these two men were not in it. Sweet Smell of Success is unusual in that it has Tony playing a nasty guy who schemes all the time, when typically he would play a much more likable character. Lancaster is even worse, playing a newspaper columnist who uses his huge influence to silence and crush any opposition to him. At first glance, Tony Curtis appears to be more of a pawn than his own person in this movie. He plays Sidney Falco, a man who works for JJ Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster), writer of a hugely successful newspaper column. Sidney's trouble comes from the fact that he is unable to find good things to say about his clients in his boss' column lately. We learn that JJ has a younger sister named Susan (Susan Harrison), of whom he is fiercely protective. JJ later finds out that his sister has become romantically attracted to a jazz musician named Steve, and he wants to find a way to get them to stop dating. Rather than climb down and lose face, JJ gets Sidney to do his dirty work. Sidney agrees, and in order to break up Susan's relationship, he prints a story about how Steve smokes weed and is also a socialist, neither of which is true. Still, the plot works and Steve gets expelled from his band. After this, Sidney sinks to a new low and tries to blackmail other columnists, which eventually leads to Steve's band getting fired from the place they play at indefinitely. Then, JJ changes his mind. He wants to get Steve back his job, but Steve doesn't want to hear it, believing JJ is nothing but trouble. Now aware that her brother has it out for her boyfriend despite promising to rehire him, Susan stops seeing Steve. JJ isn't done with Steve yet. He now orders Sidney to frame Steve as a marijuana smoker in order to back up the lies made about him earlier. To do it, Sidney goes to the club where Sidney is and puts the weed in Steve's coat. The move works, and Steve is beaten severely by a corrupt, corpulent cop named Kello. Sidney decides to celebrate by drinking with his friends, but he knows what he did was wrong. While celebrating, he gets word that JJ wants him at his apartment immediately. Upon showing up, he finds Susan ready to kill herself by jumping out the window, obviously upset about Steve's fate. Sidney grabs her and says she's making a mistake, which unfortunately coincides with JJ appearing. He demands to know why Sidney has his hands on his sister, and Susan refuses to speak up about her suicide attempt. JJ beats Sidney mercilessly until Susan tells him to stop. JJ then calls Kello on Sidney, but Sidney remains undaunted and tells JJ he's publishing the fact that he made Steve appear guilty when he wasn't. Sidney is beaten (again) by Kello, and Susan leaves her brother's apartment after telling him she'd rather die than live with him. Quite a complicated movie, but the acting and dialogue is all excellent, which shouldn't surprise anyone given who is playing the main characters. The cinematographer was also none other than James Wong Howe, a true master of camera operation. Every shot in this movie is something to behold. The plot shows how gossip is one of those things that's often more destructive than physical force, and JJ is really good at abusing this fact. I myself was very impressed with Susan Harrison's performance, even though she basically abandons Sidney to his fate at the end. Only after Sidney leaves does she tell JJ she tried to kill herself. Curtis and Lancaster are arguably both bad guys in this movie, it's just that Lancaster is worse. He gets Tony to ruin other people's reputations in order to send a message to his adversaries. Unlike them, Tony isn't afraid of him anymore in the closing minutes. Like I said earlier, people back in the 50s were having a hard time believing that Tony Curtis was not playing a good guy this time around, and it made the movie suffer reputation-wise. Even financially the movie was a failure. Ironic because it's considered one of the best noirs today and is also in the Library of Congress. Art is rarely understood in its own time.",

            "content": "Back in the 1950s, New York City had several daily newspapers that were read by its citizens religiously. Some of the more sensational ones had a resident gossip writer whose take on the society, local showbiz, and juicy stories involving celebrities was followed by everyone because it gave them a glimpse of the glamour and dirt at the same time. One of the most notorious columnists was Walter Winchell, a powerful man that ruled that world with an unequaled amount of chutzpah, making everyone fear him. One mention in his daily column could make, or destroy, whoever he wanted.\"Sweet Smell of Success\" takes a look at the New York night scene of that era with a keen eye at the people who wielded such power. J J Hunsecker was the most influential man working that circuit. He was sought by everyone who wanted to be mentioned on his newspaper, or in his radio show reaching a captive audience who took as fact whatever this man wanted to tell them.Sidney Falco, a publicist, is a hustler willing to do anything to make himself, or the clients, he represents, be noted. He wanted to be closely associated to Hunsecker. Falco would do anything to be in J J's good side. That is why he agrees to 'take care' of the problem caused when J J's sister falls for a jazz musician. Sidney, who is a kind of vile man, will go to whatever lengths in order to deliver what he promised his powerful man: separate the two lovers. In doing that, Sidney will pay dearly for his meddling. The smear he plants with a rival columnist backfires because he contributes to bring the lovers closer rather than separate them.\"Sweet Smell of Success\" was a film that reflected the type of journalism prevalent in that era. Most people were willing to sell their souls just to appear in the papers. Directed by Alexander Mackendrick, the film captured that time in New York like no other. The screenplay by Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman, took an incisive look at the people at the center of the hype being created to give the public a taste of a life they had no chance to experience. Reading about the news makers gave the common person knowledge about how the other half lived and partied. Burt Lancaster as J J Hunsecker made an impression because he clearly understood what made the man tick. Tony Curtis, who passed away recently, matched his co-star in one of his best appearances in movies. Mr. Lancaster was instrumental as a mentor of Mr. Curtis' film career. It was clearly the case of a pupil doing well to prove his worth to the man that gave him a break as an actor. Among the supporting cast, the marvelous Barbara Nichols' take on her Rita is one of the best things she did in films. David White is also impressive, even though he is not credited. The only weakness in the cast were Susan Harrison, shaky in her screen debut, and Martin Milner as her love interest.This is a film that gives today's viewer a taste of New York in one of the most exciting films of that period.",

Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) is J.J.'s gopher press agent, a petty little man who schemes to make it big among the powerful in-crowd. It's a dog-eat-dog rat race in a desperate culture populated by blonde floozies and sleazy two-bit businessmen, on the make for a fast buck. Characters are mostly angry and sarcastic. A few, like Hunsecker, are downright slimy.The film's setup is a bit garbled. Trying to figure out who is doing what to whom is a tad problematic, early on. Eventually, the plot clears up; but it doesn't get off to a good start. And I never bought the idea that a powerful man like Hunsecker required the assistance of a guy like Falco to manipulate the romantic affairs of Hunsecker's weak, pathetic sister. The film's only character worth rooting for is Steve Dallas (Martin Milner), member of a jazz group, whose ethics get him in trouble with Hunsecker and Falco.Tony Curtis gives a really fine performance in a deadbeat role. But the film's best elements are the cinematography, with those stark B&W images and noir shadows, and that jazzy Elmer Bernstein score. One almost expects beatniks to pop up in the next scene.

            "content": "Sidney Falco is a complex character. He has certain positive qualities - engaging personality, good looks, quick mind - which are canceled by his many flaws \u2013 vanity, ambition, envy, just to name a few \u2013 which drives him to worship a false god, in the person of J. J. Hunsecker, the epitome of everything Falco wants to emulate. The trouble is, Falco's false god is so flawed that anyone who worships him will be corrupted. Falco's god does not dispense blessings. Rather, he dispenses meanness. Yet, Falco by nature is not inherently mean. He is not ruthless like Eleanor Iselin or Joel Cairo. He wants to better himself socially but is guided by a distorted set of values which he has learned from a culture that is depraved. Falco knows the difference between right and wrong, yet he chooses to do wrong because to do right simply does not pay off. But by doing wrong he pays the price - not for his amorality but because he messes with the wrong people: Hunsecker, Steve, Frank, Officer Kello, Susan, Rita. These people know the street and are aggressive, and when they're hit, they hit back, hard, and Falco is doing everything he can to get a beating. But he is oblivious to that because he doesn't yet realize with whom he is dealing. But he finally learns it, the hard way, when he does something good, i.e., saves Susan's life. Instead of thanks, he gets his butt kicked, and then not once, but twice, first by Hunsecker, who gives him a taste of what is to come, and then by Kello, who finishes the job. Falco's good deed means nothing in a culture in which the most valued form of social interaction is the trading of information for favors. Falco would have done himself a huge favor by having let Susan jump; it would have given him leverage, which would have jump-started his career and earned him the instant recognition that he craved. He would have had the inside scoop on the most sensational story of the year, one that would have destroyed Hunsecker: \"Sister driven to suicide by overbearing brother.\" The resulting scandal would have propelled Falco to instant stardom. It would have made him king of the gossip-mongers. He would have shared with the world every sordid detail, from how Hunsecker first recruited him to destroy a romance involving Steve and Hunsecker's sister, to how Hunsecker's launched a vendetta against Steve, to how Hunsecker ordered him to frame Steve, to how he got the message to rush over to Hunsecker's apartment, to how he arrived just at the moment that Susan was about to jump, and finally to how Hunsecker reacted after learning that his sister had committed suicide. Everyone involved would have become the subject of the most intense scrutiny, by the police and by the press. Falco's name would have been blasted all over the media. It would have become a media circus with Falco as the ringmaster. The relationship between Hunsecker and Officer Kello would have been revealed. Kello might have quit his job and gone to work for Falco. The whole world would have learned about Hunsecker's cold and ruthless nature. Speculation on the nature of Hunsecker's relationship with his sister would have been rampant. Every gossip columnist in the world would have been knocking on Falco's door for the story, not so much to learn about a tragic death of a young woman but to gather mud to use against Hunsecker, with Falco in charge of the mud pit. But Falco messes up; although brash and pushy, he's not yet cruel; he's still not jaded enough to exploit death; he does good when the situation required that he do bad, like Hunsecker would have done. The moral of story: if you can't be a player, then don't try to play.",

And for me it doesn't deliver on its set-up. We just get similar nasty scenes over and over. Will Lanccaster get nastier? Well yeah, of course, that's all he does. I think putting Hensecker next to that sister (so wholesome it's hard to believe she grew up anywhere within twenty miles of him is improbable, if not grotesque). Ditto for jazz guitarist Martin Milner who is horrified to be associated with marijuana. When the cig girl sells out and puts out, I didn't care. Because her characterization is drawn so broadly.

Hunsecker (AFI's #35 villain), played ruthlessly by Burt Lancaster.Hunsecker treats Falco, and virtually everyone else he encounters including a Senator who is beholden to him, like \"a poodle\" that will \"jump through flaming rings\" for him, or so says Hunsecker's weak and vulnerable younger sister Susan (played by Susan Harrison); of course, Falco will.The columnist, who wields his power confidently, fearlessly, is particularly upset with Falco for not doing him a favor by breaking up his sister's love for a young, up-and-coming musician named Steve Dallas (Martin Milner). Hence, he's cut off the publicity man's ability to continue to make his living by selling access to his powerful associate's column.Hunsecker justifies his actions because his warped mind has enabled him to believe that he is the lifeblood of the 60 million people who read his column, and that what he does is somehow patriotic (when he's really a scoundrel). But J.J.'s weakness is his sister; he acts like a father-figure and believes himself to be her protector because she's really all he's got. He tries to (surreptitiously, through Falco) control her life by crushing anyone (like Dallas) that comes between them and threatens to bring about the lonely, miserable life he'd have without her.Falco avoids his own secretary (Jeff Donnell) because she reflects the conscious and self respect that he should have, but doesn't. Sam Levene plays the musician's agent; Emile Meyer plays a meat-fisted cop who owes Hunsecker a favor. Barbara Nichols plays a pathetic cigarette girl whose misguided love Falco uses to advantage for his own sordid purposes.Directed by Alexander Mackendrick, who'd received his only Oscar recognition for co-writing The Man in the White Suit (1951), the drama was written by Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman. The film was somehow completely and inexplicably snubbed \u2013 especially its lead acting and James Wong Howe's gritty B&W cinematography \u2013 by the Academy, though it was added to the National Film Registry in 1993.",

And as much as I did like The Big Knife from two years earlier, with Jack Palance, which also had writing by Clifford Odets, Sweet Smell of Success was a far better and more consistent film.There are so many things that are done so wonderfully in Sweet Smell of Success that it is hard to decide where to start praising it. It is a very accomplished looking film, with atmospheric lighting and elegant-looking costuming and settings. Elmer Bernstein's jazzy music score is both electrifyingly characterful and hauntingly powerful, matching the atmosphere brilliantly and enhancing even more effectively. The story is ceaselessly compelling, with the gritty realism of it being so ahead of its time(i.e. Lancaster's relationship with his sister) and the atmosphere whether bitingly satirical, poignant or moodily oppressive is so rich. It's very intelligently directed by Alexander MacKendrick, and the characters are astonishingly vivid. Has Tony Curtis ever had a meatier character? Possibly not.In Sweet Smell of Success there are three components that are especially great. The outstanding cinematography(by far the standout elements visually) is one, both luminous and moody, Sweet Smell of Success has to be one of the best-looking films of the late 50s. The screenplay sizzles and crackles thrillingly, not only boasting some of cinema's quotable lines but also bringing the characters to life so vividly, nothing whatsoever over-heated here like the writing in The Big Knife has been criticised to be by viewers. Then we have Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster, who both give career-best performances, Curtis has the showier role and completely lives it in a way rarely seen before with him(for the record, I happen to like Curtis so this is in no way a criticism) while Lancaster has never been more spine-curdling. The rest of the cast are fine too, but it's Curtis and Lancaster who really live long in the memory.Overall, a fantastic film, and deserving all the praise it's received and deserves even more. It's a touch anti-climactic at the end(a slightly longer length might have helped) but even that is nowhere near enough to drag down the film when everything else is so good.

Basically Sidney Falco (BAFTA nominated Tony Curtis) is the hustling New York publicist who is consumed by desperate ambition and hates himself because of it, and he will do anything to gain the admiration of powerful newspaper columnist J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster). J.J. hires Sidney to break up the love between J.J.'s young sister Susan (introducing Susan Harrison) and Steve Dallas (Martin Milner) by any means possible. What makes J.J. such a terrible brother to Susan, and the villain of the film, is because of his incestuous relation with his sister, not just calling her \"dear\", but stroking and kissing her, and she obviously is too afraid to do anything. Towards the end, Susan attempts suicide after finding out Steve was killed in an accident, and J.J. catches Sidney in her place, accusing him of doing something to his sister, and slapping him constantly. In the end, Susan finally plucks up the courage to leave his brother, and tell him what she really thinks of him and all he's done to her. Also starring Sam Levene as Frank D' Angelo, Barbara Nichols as Rita, Jeff Donnell as Sally, Joseph Leon as Joe Robard, Edith Atwater as Mary, Emile Meyer as Lt. Harry Kello and Joe Frisco as Herbie Temple. It wasn't quite the film I had in mind, because it was a bit too chatty, and it didn't seem like there was a lot of point, but it was certainly worth watching. J.J. Hunsecker was number 35 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, Tony Curtis was number 86 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and Burt Lancaster was number 19 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 48 on The World's Greatest Actor.

Hardly any good men in this, though, as we see how the popular newspaper gossip writers go about their business and the pleasure they take with their snide insinuations and malicious digs. Curtis is fantastic playing against type and this is probably his finest work, Lancaster is similarly playing it more darkly and is so scary, with minimal movement and a steely glare. Much has been said about the seeming weakness of the young lovers and maybe Lancaster's sister could have been more of a wild child and her jazz friend more of a hip cat.

            "content": "Film noir? Black comedy? Journalism morality play? The secret to loving \"Sweet Smell Of Success\" for me is watching it as a horror film once removed.All-powerful newspaper columnist J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) is this movie's Dracula, his eyes gleaming out at you from a newspaper delivery van in the opening sequence like a bespectacled Nosferatu. He prowls Manhattan at night, his heavy jacket with upturned collar like a cape, sucking Manhattan of every vagrant juice of life he can find and corrupting it into something malignant. Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) is his Renfield, servant to his darkest impulses even when he twinges with regret.A terrifically nasty comedy/horror story, \"Sweet Smell Of Success\" is justly prized for its harsh tone and snappy dialogue. Lancaster dashes off his lines with an assurance that only barely conceals his pathology. \"Don't be a two-time loser, Sidney. The penalty could be severe.\" \"Here's your head, what's your hurry?\" \"You're dead. Get yourself buried.\" J.J.'s problem is he needs love but has no concept of how it works. Like Charles Foster Kane, he understands love only on his own terms, and sad terms they are.Other commenters suggest possibly incestuous feelings for his sister Susie (Susan Harrison). As I see it, he's not that way at all. Rather, he's selfishly possessive, fearful of the world he holds at bay and imagining somehow he can keep his soul safe in the form of his relationship with Susie. Threatened by Susie's relationship with jazzman Steve Dallas (Martin Milner), he plots to break up their romance so aggressively he fails to see the damage he can cause.J.J. and Sidney are both remarkably asexual for lead characters. Sidney is only interested in women for what they can do for his career, and is probably the film's nastiest character. As played by Curtis, he's also remarkably sympathetic. When we see him try to plant a \"blind item\" against Dallas by blackmailing a rival columnist, I actually root for him to succeed, and wince at his failure. Though Lancaster is the lead-billed actor, this is Curtis's movie more than anyone's - and does he deliver.Not that Lancaster isn't great as well, in a performance of measured coldness and not a few vicious laughs. \"Well, that's show business\" he chuckles when a cop tells him a woman he's been writing up in his column died in the hospital.This is still a moral movie, with two decent characters in Susie and Steve worth rooting for and a grounded ending that suggests some residual optimism. Susan Harrison is this movie's secret weapon, her luminous dark eyes timid and trusting as the light falls upon her asymmetric beauty, captured so vividly like New York at night by legendary cinematographer James Wong Howe.The film never comes at you the same way two scenes in a row, testament to the combined genius of writers Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman and the mordant pacing of director Alexander Mackendrick. A cruel cop threatens Falco with merry quips. The columnist Falco tries to blackmail has a breakthrough with his jaded wife instead. J.J. is sharp, as his zippy lingo attests, but not too smart - he has to ask Falco how to spell \"Picasso\".It's a world I like to visit and worry I might live in, and it comes alive in this movie in a way cinema rarely accomplishes. Like a great horror film, \"Sweet Smell Of Success\" repels you with the depths of its depravity but beguiles you with its commitment and sinister charm.",

            "content": "When it comes to the newspapers in the movies, they are usually portrayed in one of the two following extremes. Either they are heroic figures, fighting against political corruption and sleaze, or uncovering a massive conspiracy that have failed to have been noticed, in such films as The Killing Fields or the classic All The President's Men. Or they are complete scum, sticking their noses in or desperately trying to spin a story to the expense of someone's privacy, such as in Salvador (although James Woods' character is the central figure, he is portrayed as sweaty, booze-addled and pathetic) and La Dolce Vita, where the term 'papparazzo' was formed. In terms of the latter, never has the newspapers been so viciously portrayed as in Sweet Smell Of Success, where desperation and lies are the name of the game.Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) is a young press agent working for columnist giant J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster), who has set Falco the task of breaking up the relationship between up-and-coming jazz musician Steve Dallas (Martin Milner) and Hunsecker's sister Susan (Susan Harrison). Falco is at the point of desperation, as the two are on to his plans, so Falco puts into motion an act so complex and devious that it just might work. He sets about ruining Dallas' reputation by spreading the rumour that he's a pothead Communist, only to have Hunsecker then salvage his reputation. Falco foresees that Dallas would then reject Hunsecker's help, opposing the nature of his work, and thus causing Susan to break off the relationship. While all this is going on, Falco is losing money and clients, and must scheme his way out of his situation and have to deal with the monstrous Hunsecker.The greatest thing about this stone-cold classic is the complete lack of conscience between the two leads. While Curtis' good looks may make him the more sympathetic of the two, his character is an absolute slimeball, and we watch him repeatedly cheat, scam and bulls**t his way out of corners, all for the benefit of his career. In my opinion, it's Curtis' greatest performance. He will always be remembered primarily for his cross-dressing performance in Some Like It Hot, but here he puts his charm and good looks on the line for the sake of a complex and extremely mature performance. It is a performance he would come close to equalling later on in his career in the thoroughly underrated The Boston Strangler. Lancaster is nothing short of terrifying. One of the greatest 'villains' in history, he is a tower of rage and brutality, using people left right and centre for his own selfish means. He is completely lacking in sympathy and ethics, and Falco laps up every order and direction like a obedient dog. He is the domineering force of the film, even though Tony Curtis eats up the majority of the screen time.The screenplay has enough words to fill about 5 feature-length scripts. It's full of wonderful one-liners and riveting monologues and they are all delivered with skill by the cast. It's similar to another classic set in the world of newspapers His Girl Friday. Yet while the fast-paced dialogue was used in that film for comedy purposes and to allow leads Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell to bounce sexily off each other, here it is used as a way to portray the evilness of its leads, confusing the audience as much as they confuse the victims of their acid-tongued schemes. Director Alexander Mackendrick, who also directed Ealing classics The Man In The White Suit and The Ladykillers, shoots the whole film with a noir-ish bleakness. Even though the film is set in a fast- paced world filled with stars and classy settings, the film managed to capture the emptiness of the surroundings and of the profession.A true classic, featuring staggering performances by the two leads, and fantastic, unfussy direction from Mackendrick.

In the end her ego turns out to be less vulnerable than his own.\"Sweet smell of success\" is an outsider in the oeuvre of Alexander Mackendrick, but it is an outsider with everything in the right place. The cynical story, two brilliant lead actors, a perfect jazzy score and very beautiful black and white cinematography of James Wong Howe.",

            "content": "Sweet Smell of Success (1957) **** (out of 4) Broadway columnist J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) is afraid of losing his younger sister (Susan Harrison) so he gets press agent Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) to try and fix some evidence that will ruin the man she's in love with. With such a simple storyline you'd never expect something like this to turn out to be one of the greatest movies ever made but the SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS has enough power for three movies and on a technical level it's flawless as we get some tremendous performances, a bitter and stinging story and one of the greatest looking pictures ever made. This film has been called a noir even though there's not a single murder, gun or even the slightest bit of violence. The murder weapon here is a cruel heart and the evilness of men to corrupt anything just as long as they get their way and I personally can't think of another film ever made that captures the corrupt side of the media. The movie is about a lot of things but it's easy to see why this movie didn't clean up at the box office or at the Oscars when it was originally released. Seeing how the media or at least one man could ruin the life of someone might not have struck people as much back in the day but when viewed today it's clear this film was way ahead of its time and it probably plays a lot better today than ever before. The entire film is so brilliantly made that you just float from one scene to the next with a tension in your stomach because you know an innocent life is mixed up in all the lies and that there's only one way it will all come out. The cinematography is without question some of the greatest ever seen as James Wong Howe makes the visuals their own character. The beautiful way he uses darkness to show the evils of the characters is remarkably well done and especially whenever Lancaster is on the screen and his \"meetings\" are held in bars where the shadows mark all the cruelty that's in his heart. When the press agent is running around town trying to push his clients into the newspapers, the way the bright lights and terrific jazz score from Elmer Bernstein jump off the screen to show the fast paced side of the business. The performances by Lancaster and Curtis are two of the greatest you're ever going to see so seeing as how neither was nominated for an Oscar is just downright shocking. Both men are so good that you never see Lancaster and Curtis but instead you see these rather evil characters who will stop at nothing to win. What I loved most about Lancaster's performance is how you can just look in his eyes at any point in the film and see that he's thinking. This character's mind works a mile a minute and the way Lancaster shows this is remarkable to watch. The two men certainly know how to work off one another as their chemistry is perfect. Harrison, Martin Milner, Jeff Donnell, Barbara Nichols and Same Levene all add strong support. Another major \"character\" here is the dialogue, which is some of the sharpest you're ever going to here with one terrific line after another. In the fifty-plus years since it's release, the movie has become a classic and rightfully so as you're really not going to find too many movies that do so much with such a simple set-up.",

            "content": "British director Alexander Mackendrick's \"Sweet Smell of Success\" should be required viewing for all journalism and communication majors. Cinematographer James Wong Howe's 1957 brilliant black and white, noirish Manhattan Bistro Belt leaves no shades of doubt: The newspaper business, with its public-relations half-brother, is a quagmire of greed gone unchecked. The powerful Broadway columnist J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster), a thinly veiled portrait of the real gossip king, Walter Winchell, pressures publicist Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) to break up J. J's sister, Susan, and her boyfriend.The way to discredit the innocent boyfriend, jazz guitarist Steve Dallas (Martin Milner), is through innuendo in a newspaper column. Falco is happy to please J.J. by arranging the matter. An Iago to a blameworthy Othello, Falco descends into gritty urban politics to advance his career and destroy Steve 's.The caution in the tale about abusing the public trust is obvious; it's the subtexts that fascinate, for example, J. J's obsessive protection of his nineteen-year-old sister that borders on incest (He says with too much caring, \"You're all I've got in this whole wide world\"). Under the terms of this civilized warfare, however, Nemesis, although a lame goddess, will catch up with the sinners (Even Winchell, who tried to stop his daughter's marriage through his column, is thought to have suffered severe damage to his career because of this film).The screenplay, adapted by two writing greats, Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman, is so good that you'd want to see it on DVD in order to back up to hear the lines again and again, for example, when J. J. says to Falco, \"I'd hate to take a bite out of you. You're a cookie full of arsenic\" and \"You're dead, Son. Get yourself buried.\" Lancaster and Curtis, with the roles of a lifetime, transcend their glamorous Hollywood personas to become unforgettable as the slimy protagonists.The jazz accompaniment to the film, both in the night club and on the film's track, is tense and anti-romantic, a score most suited to this noir hell full of conniving, selfish, brutal urbanites. Mike Nichols' recent \"Closer\" depicts the same dangerous landscape, this time T.S. Eliot's \"Unreal City,\" London, where deceitful lovers ruin each other's lives through infidelity rather than slander. The result is the same--dark films about the underside of greed, fraught with danger and disappointment. Hunsecker says about New York, \"I love this dirty town.\" But Eliot again sets it all straight in his \"Choruses from 'The Rock'\": \"When the Stranger says: 'What is the meaning of this city?' . . . What will you answer? 'We all dwell together to make money from each other'?\" Only the city survives in a film noir perfectly suited to the arguably greatest town on earth. Or Hell.",

Based on celebrity columnist and powermonger Walter Winchell, Hunsecker is to Winchell what Charles Foster Kane was to William Randolph Hearst - a bitter portrait that has forever (perhaps unfairly) become inextricably associated with the man, and one of the great monsters of Twentieth Century Cinema. This was a critical and commercial failure on first release, only to become one of that much-misnamed breed, a \"cult movie.\" In Barry Levinson's \"Diner\", one the characters endlessly quotes the astringently poetic dialogue from the movie, written by blacklisted playwright Clifford Odets. A Scottish director of Ealing comedies,  Mackendrick worked with cinematographer James Wong Howe to achieve a cold, glistening look to the film - Howe washed the walls of rooms for the interior shots with oil to achieve the right glycerine glitter.\nThe film is a portrait of the New York worlds of showbiz and the media years ahead of its time in its harshness and cynicism. Tony Curtis plays Sidney Falco, a slimy publicity agent who will do anything to slide to the top; when Hunsecker wishes to break up his sister's relationship with a jazz musician, Falco acts as his bagman. The good characters in this film are ineffectual ciphers - the vaulting ambition of Sidney Falco and the incestuous control-freakery of J.J. Hunsecker linger long in the imagination. As Sidney himself says, \"the best of everything is good enough for me\" - and this is one of the best.",

The biting script by Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman boasts lots of spot-on stinging go-for-the-throat lines (Hunsecker to Falco: \"You're a cookie full of arsenic\"), provides a trenchant exploration of ethics and the abuse of power, and presents two unforgettably mean'n'rotten main characters who share an extremely tense and uncomfortable symbiotic relationship, with Falco in particular standing out as a disgustingly stark embodiment of ruthless ambition at its most vile, overt, and obsequious.Lancaster and Curtis both do sterling work in their meaty roles; they receive sturdy support from Jeff Donnell as loyal secretary Sally, Sam Levene as antsy agent Frank D'Angelo, Barbara Nichols as sweet cigarette girl Rita, and Emile Meyer as the crooked Lt. Harry Kello. James Wong Howe's beautifully crisp black and white cinematography gives this picture a moody noirish look. Elmer Bernstein's swinging jazz score does the groovy trick.

Although Ernie Lehman gets a co-writer credit (and it was, after all, his original novel) his contribution is a bad nowhere to Odets and aficionados of the plays recognize instantly the unique brand of Odets dialogue. Lancaster turns in another sterling job as a thinly disguised Walter Winchell and Tony Curtis is surprisingly adequate as Sidney Falco the desperate and amoral PR man living off J.J. Hunsecker's handouts. Martin Milner was equally good playing his second hot-headed musician (drummer Joey Firestone in Pete Kelly's Blues, guitarist Dallas here) in two years. Sam Levene, Barbara Nichols and Emile Meyer are also effective as is Susan Harrison, making her debut - that strangely led nowhere - as Lancaster's catalyst sister. From the opening shot of night-time Manhattan overlaid with Elmer Bernstein's quintessential 'fifties' jazz-inflected soundtrack the film never lets up, telling its story in visual and oral - 'the cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river' - shorthand.

But it did score with critics, and has since achieved status as a minor masterpiece. Never has the tawdry world of New York show business been so savagely portrayed as in the characters of Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) and J. J.

Still it's fascinating stuff. Tony Curtis gets the role he was born to play, a charmingly unscrupulous press agent, and a gutsy departure for this former matin\u00e9e idol. The dialogue is first rate with many memorable lines, as the characters bounce off one another like competitors in a demolition derby. Photography is aptly noirish with emphasis on lounge lizard locations. There's a distinct feel to this movie setting it apart from other depictions of New York decadence. It's a style and mood that linger: the leering cop, the offended wife, the crawling street scenes. Somehow a bunch of Hollywood types got together with a British director, a Chinese-American cameraman, and a couple of New York writers to craft this timeless foray into mid-century America.

            "content": "Sweet Smell Of Success is one of those films which stands out and stands alone. It is almost indefinable. Directed by a Scotsman, Alexander Mackendrick, who until then had only directed comedies for Ealing Studios, it reputedly had a painful genesis according The Bad And The Beautiful: Hollywood In The Fifties by Sam Kashner and Jennifer MacNair (a rather more intelligent account of various Tinseltown shenanigans than you might assume from the book's rather lurid title. Get a copy and learn all about how the gossip sheet Confidential hounded many stars, the cynical betrayal of closet gays to save the careers of other closet gays, and how many big names ratted on friends to the House Unamerican Activities Committee to save their own skin.) There were deep disagreements between its three producers and Burt Lancaster, both a producer and one of the films two stars putting the fear of God into all and sundry. The film was based on a novella by Ernest Lehman, one of the screenwriters, but every one of the screenplays he came up with was more or less rejected and golden boy playwright Clifford Odets was recruited to beef them up. Even then, director Mackendrick also had a hand in writing the screenplay and rewriting took place while some scenes were already being shot. The character portrayed by Lancaster was a thinly veiled portrait of the deeply unpleasant Walter Winchell, who tried to have the film shut down and banned. He didn't succeed, but the studio took fright, refused to promote the film and, inevitably, it flopped horribly at the box office. That is deeply ironic because it might well deserve mention in any list of the best top ten films ever made. The cinematography by James Wong Howe was, for its time, revolutionary in that he filmed on location in New York by night in natural light. I believe, in fact that more or less the whole film was shot on location. A jazz score by Elmer Bernstein features prominently, and Susan Harrison, who plays the female lead was said to be so scared by the whole production that she called time on her career at the young age of 25. That might or might not be true, but whether true or not, it gives you a flavour of the bad vibes which emanated from the making of the film. Quite apart from the film's difficulties and new approach, Sweet Smell Of Success is remarkable in that neither of the two leading players is by any stretch of the imagination a 'hero'. Both in fact, Tony Curtis's highly memorable but deeply unpleasant publicity agent Sidney Falco and Lancaster's supremely odious newspaper columnist J.J. Hunsecker \u2014 the supposed Walter Winchell character \u2014 are thoroughly despicable. Both are prepared to go to any lengths to get what they want: Hunsecker will have his sister's beau framed for marijuana possession and beaten up by corrupt police in order to break up the romance and Falco manipulates the cigarette girl who is sweet on him to sleep with another columnist in order to obtain a favour. You don't watch Sweet Smell to find role models. There isn't, in fact, much of a plot \u2014 the whole point of the film is its depiction of these two lowlifes. There is not a bad performance in the film, but outstanding by a country mile is Curtis's performance as the amoral, cynical and manipulative but charming Falco. It would be unfair to claim that he carries the film because that implies others aren't up to it. But it would be wholly fair to claim that Curtis is quite simply mesmerising. You might catch this late at night on TV or at a retrospective, or you might, like me, go out of your way to buy your own DVD copy. But if you do get a chance to see this, don't miss it. You'll love everything about it.",

The cinematography is very good - McKendrick was an excellent director, but much of what goes on is obscure, the lines are mumbled, the proceedings are supposed to be gripping but in fact are just melodramatic. Judging from the reviews, the movie has its fans but for me, it is just another example of how quickly films setting out to be challenging and contemporary can become ... faded.

I think that Tony Curtis, despite his reputation, did a great job. Burt Lancaster as J. J. Hunsecker is a dominant character. The columnist, who suffers from excessive possessiveness and pathological love for his younger sister. He is elegant and restrained. However, his character is revealed through violent emotions.Both characters are two-faced in different ways. Their relationship best describes the mutual dependence and a thin line between love and hate.Susan Harrison as Susan Hunsecker is distraught, dejected and helpless character. She fought, at the same time, for her love, and healing in an unhealthy world. Martin Milner as Steve Dallas is a talented musician and honest young man. A harmless romantic, who becomes the victim of sick minds. Love will find a way at any cost. This sounds a bit cynical, but it is real in this film.Finally, a big fish mainly eat small fish, but one small fish, meanwhile, has become too much.",

He captures New York at night in such a striking way that if almost any of the frames flying by us at 24fps was captured as a still image, it would rival the works Brassa\u00ef, Berenice Abbott, and other great black and white photographers. Add to that a very snappy script brimming with electric dialogue, performances from Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis that are easily among their best, and a very cool jazz soundtrack. The film is slick and stylish in its aesthetic, which is contrasted in a story showing us the worst sides of power and manipulative behavior. Apparently the character of the ruthless columnist J.J. Hunsecker (Lancaster) was based on Walter Winchell, who was a real piece of work. It's mesmerizing to watch him keep a press agent (Curtis) under his thumb; while the two have a symbiotic relationship at least in theory, they're like watching a couple of reptiles.

It's simply brilliant! It's an absolutely captivating, good old fashioned, movie that sucks you right in and plays around a lot with you. The movie its story is far from a predictable one and you are constantly unsure on how to feel about the characters and their actions in this movie. Basically all of them are rotten, dirty, lying ones that will do about anything for a good and juicy story.It's actually a quite surprising movie coming from director Alexander Mackendrick, a man who was mostly notable for the British comedies he did. Everybody knows his movie \"The Ladykillers\", so seeing that he could also direct straight and heavy drama's so extremely well came as quite a surprise.It's not just the story that is great but it foremost is also really the dialog in it. Every line spoken in it is so well written, which also really help to build the movie its characters and make them such powerful and memorable ones.But credit for this should not only go to the screenplay writer Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman but of course also to the actors that are portraying them. It might very well be true that this movie features both Burt Lancaster's and Tony Curtis' best performances.In this movie its characters are constantly fighting each other. They however don't do this with their fists or other means of violence but verbally only. The one person says one thing and other tries to overtake him, purely by talking to each other. They call each other and get themselves into all kinds of tight corners, just to get what they personally want. Everybody in this movie is being extremely egocentric and they often don't take others people's feeling into consideration. They constantly try to be one, or two or even three steps ahead of the other person. This requires some great writing and acting, in order to let it all work out well and this movie obviously has that all.There is really nothing bad to say about this movie.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

But it was impossible for me to figure out why everyone hated each other and their jobs. It was like watching a movie on fast forward.

            "content": "\"Sweet smell of success\" is a good film, with an interesting and rather unusual story, a steady pace, but somehow damaged by a melodramatic script. A main credit to the movie lies in the cinematography, with plenty of beautiful shots of a nocturnal New York. The screenplay is not wholly convincing, since it seems more suited to the stage than to cinema. I mean, all the characters are so ready and brilliant in their dialogs, exactly like in a stage-play. We may expect a sharp wit from Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster), since to be witty is his job. But what about, say, the cigarette-girl? Or the straightforward wife of the non-corrupt journalist? Some lines, the like of \"I love this dirty city\", are dated, to say the least. Hunsecker's morbid, psychotic love toward his sister is the crux of the film, but it remains somehow unexplained. My guess is that he is eager to preserve her virginity as the unique pure thing in a corrupt world... But who knows? Sometimes he seems to love his own power more than his sister. An interesting character, no doubt. Tony Curtis shines in his trade-mark role of the good-looking cheater, sleazy and greedy womanizer. Here we have the drama-version of the character, and I liked it, although I prefer Tony's comedy-version in masterpieces like \"Some like it hot\" or \"Operation petticoat\". Actually, Sidney Falco is the most hateful character ever played by Curtis. Burt Lancaster is very good, although slightly over-the-top. All the cast makes a fine job. Such an overwhelming power of the gossip columnist Hunsecker as shown in the movie seems unlikely, not only today but even in the late 1950s. The movie presents some more or less subtle political messages which, honestly, I didn't appreciate. And I was even more displeased discovering that Hunsecker's character was based on a real person (allegedly, at a time when he had already lost his power). Not very elegant stuff out of authors devoted to condemn in the movie writers stabbing people in the back... I am not sure to like much \"Sweet smell of success\" (in fact, I don't like the title, either). However it is certainly an exciting and interesting movie, worth to be viewed.",

For his d\u00e9but, after a few projects initially fell through, he chose to adapt the Ernest Lehman novelette about power, greed and corruption. Working from a screenplay by Lehman (who subsequently co-wrote the screenplay of Alfred Hitchcock's \"North by Northwest\" [1959]) and acclaimed American playwright Clifford Odets, he made this black as midnight noir.Tony Curtis plays press agent Sidney Falco who (who would sell his soul to get ahead and to have the \"Sweet Smell of Success\") cannot get his clients mentioned in the influential, but horrifically egocentric J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster in a towering performance) column. Employed by Hunsecker to disrupt his younger sister's romance with an up-and-coming Jazz guitarist Steve Dallas (Martin Milner), who is a relation of Falco', things go terribly out of control.Mackendick details the inevitably downfall of Falco with unsparing precision, a man who is always just outside of the big time. Tony Curtis gives possibly the best performance of his illustrious career, Burt Lancaster, as I mentioned before, is stunningly brilliant at being bad, Martin Milner, an actor who never seemed to make it big in movies, perhaps undeservedly so, despite appearing in classics like \"The Long Gray Line\" (1955), \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" (1957) and \"Compulsion\" (1959), is surprisingly good as the man in sensitive Susan Harrison as Susan Hunsecker;s life and Emile Meyer as Harry Kello is suitably crooked as the cop in J.J.'s pocket.

            "content": "\"Sweet Smell of Success\": an olfactory alliteration littered with the foulest aspects of greed and ambition, how far ego can go, how dignity doesn't amount to a hill of Heinz beans and how ethics are no match for the green rectangle's appeal.This is a film made by a director whose named has faded into oblivion, Alexander McKendrick, it was poorly received by the audience but not the critics. As members of the Press, they could relate to the corners some unethical members of their professions cut... or were driven to. I'm no journalist but the film made me understand paparazzi, the pictures they take are just bargaining ships, nothing personal, only business.And in the film, the principal currency of this business consists of articles that can make or break people just like Twitter comments undo careers today. As smears, they become weapons with the newspapers as crime settings... the muscle is Sidney Falco and the mastermind is J.J. Hunsecker, the shady press agent and the egomaniac press columnist and national icon. The two men are as thick as thieves and form an unforgettable Faustian duo, they don't like each other, but Falco allows Hunsecker to see how high he climbed his way up and Hunsecker is the Sherpa who can take him to the same Everest of power, watching New York City as microcosm of the very America he just conquered. \"I love that dirty town\" says Hunsecker... ignoring that he's part of that very dirt, a furoncle stuck to New York City's body pulsating to the rhythm of sex, drugs and jazz.For the trivia, J.J. Hunsecker was named 35th villain in the AFI's Top 50 but Falco is the soulless soul of the story, only redeemed by the fact that he's not as bad as his mentor, which is not saying much. When we first meet him, his name isn't even painted on the door but taped on it, his office and room make one, he's to his profession what Lionel Hutz is to lawyers, a disgrace... but of the sympathetic type. Who can resist that smile? Tony Curtis wanted to prove he wasn't just a cutie pie and battled to get the role, I can't picture another actor as Sidney Falco (same judgment with the \"bigger one\"). I admit it, I appreciated his boundless ambition that kept him awake all the night on the lookout of any scoop, any tip to a scoop, any promise to a juicy reward. I liked his clean-cut image, his rapid fire repartee and his tactical genius combined with a total lack of scruples. As one of his employers told him \"I wouldn't hire you if you weren't a liar\"there are layers or liar. One who plays in another league is definitely Hunsecker, based on sulfuric columnist Walter Winchell... actually, that contextualization is irrelevant, we don't remember \"Citizen Kane\" for being a merely disguised pamphlet against William Randolph Hearst, do we? But it's interesting how a film meant to denounce sordidness of its time spoke statements about the excesses of power modern audiences could easily identify, especially in our social media time. Hunsekcer wants to crush a decent jazz player because he disapproves his union with his sister and Burt Lancaster plays him in the kind of smooth performance that doesn't give you the heart to despise him, maybe it's the signature grin, the catchy lines such as \"You're dead. Get buried\" or the little truths behind cruel thoughts... or maybe the glasses, but when you see Hunsecker, you kind of understand Falco. Hunsecker paved the way to all corrupt and charismatic executives such as Gordon Gekko or Buddy Ackerman and in his establishing scene, we're tempted to admire him. Seated at a fancy restaurant, the bespectacled muscular tycoon is verbally crucifying a manager and lecturing a senator when Falco joins him, earning himself an unforgiving description concluding with the film's most defining line \"Match me, Sidney\". The real pay-off of that moment isn't in Falco's refusal to light Hunsecker's cigarette, which of course is part of his \"smiling street-urchin pal\" act, but when later, both manage to break up the relationship and Hunsecker doesn't even have to ask Falco, the right-hand man complies as automatically as a living Zeppo. At that point, he's a match to Hunsecker, will it last? Later, Hunsecker admits \"I'd hate to take a bite out of you, you're a cookie full of arsenic\". How many 50s movies feature such hateful but eloquent protagonists, some blamed the bland performances of the romantic pair but they were merely pawns, the story is about the chess-master and the game. And the game is played in a short period of two nights where we see Falco moving his pieces, going as far as framing an innocent man, lying, pimping a poor woman and blackmailing an editor in front of his wife, with such ardor that he's immediately taught a lesson of decency, but no one can checkmate Falco because the real adversary is himself, as Hunsecker points out, \"you're prisoner of your own fears and ambitions\". Little did he know that he was also prisoner of his own ego. \"Sweet Smell of Success\" is a quotable masterpiece that feels as fresh as it was sixty years ago, proving that America didn't wait for the New Wave to reinvent itself and maybe that's why the film didn't meet with commercial success, it was ahead of its time... and forgive the hackneyed expression, severely underrated.Though it's quite a poetic irony that the film didn't meet with success because it provides a rather stinky image of success. Nonetheless, the film is a noir classic, modern in every sense of the word and certainly the best performances of both Curtis and Lancaster. Success stinks in the film but the films has a cinematic fragrance for the ages.",

The story of a powerful man who controls everything and everyone around him is a bitter and cruel portrait of the dog eat dog world of media, press agents, social columnists and artists.Burt Lancaster in his best performance plays J.J. Hunsecker, a mean newspaper columnist who uses of his power and influence to destroy everyone against him. His major concern appears when his sister (Susan Harrison) gets involved with a Jazz musician (Martin Milner) something J.J. doesn't aproove. The unscrupulous press agent Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) is the right guy on the right time and he's going to destroy this relationship, making false accusations about the musician, helping his boss to fulfill his plans. And what Sidney gets with that? Well, maybe a future in the press world writing his own column, something he treasures for a long time. And if you think J.J. is friendlier to Sidney you're totally wrong. He's frightening, despises everyone, everything and in every single moment. The quotes delivered by Lancaster are some of the most sharp and mean of the film history such as \"You're dead, son. Get yourself buried.\" ignoring Curtis character; or \"Son, I don't relish shooting a mosquito with an elephant gun, so why don't you just shuffle along?\" and, of course the classic \"I'd hate to take a bite outta you. You're a cookie full of arsenic.\" My favorite quote is when he talks about New York with a bright gleam in his eyes: \"I love this dirty town\". Directed by Alexander Mackendrick, this almost forgotten classic fought against everything Hollywood used to make at the time of its release back in 1957. By developing a story with no likable characters, plenty of scenes shot at night, presenting a mean and cruel world (but very realistic) audiences simply passed the chance to appreciate many of the qualities this film presented and the movie bombed at box-office. But critics even then always recognized the value and importance of the film, quoting on how interesting and relevant the story was, the rhythm and originality of the dialogs and all.Besides the incredible screenplay written by Ernest Lehman and Clifford Odets and the spectacular performances of the cast, I need to highlight the music composed by Elmer Bernstein, using jazz themes very suitable to the moment; and the cinematography work by James Wong Howe, who shoot many night scenes in black and white, setting a beautiful and noir atmosphere to New York (many scenes were filmed on Times Square). You have the sensation that the nights are endless in New York, with all those shining lights, the open bars and the fancy restaurants. This interesting character study about success, greed and unethical journalism is still relevant to date. Or you think that some media professionals don't act like J.J. Hensecker? Well, maybe yes, maybe no. I think people have a little bit of tact while doing things because they remember the famous quote: \"Treat people good and with respect, on your way up since you will meet the same people on your way down\". But this is not one of J.J.'s quotes so you're going to enter in a ferocious and careless world but it's a cinema masterpiece. 10/10",

I don't know if 'slimy' and 'gritty' go together very well, but this edgy Fifties film noir contains elements of both with just about every characterization delivered by the principal players. Burt Lancaster's J.J. Hunsecker is a noted gossip columnist with the 'morals of a guinea pig and scruples of a gangster', while his stooge Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) will do anything to achieve that 'sweet smell of success'. He puts it best actually when he says - \"In brief, the best of everything is good enough for me\".These aren't the only despicable characters, merely the ones who maintain our fascination the most. But the film also offers crooked politicians, crooked cops, and crooked females mostly trying to play it straight. All of the portrayals are marvelous, and with dialog that crackles, the film zips along with a heady jazz score that eerily complements the sordid machinations of a press agent doing his dirty work to break up a romance for personal and professional gain.The only issue I have with the story is the lack of motivation supplied by Lancaster's character. It was never really clear to me why he wanted to insulate his sister from growing up and having a life of her own. Simply explaining it away as a power trip doesn't go far enough, and targeting Steve Dallas (Martin Milner) just because he was sister Suzie's (Susan Harrison) boyfriend didn't seem logical. Dallas looked like a stand up guy all the way around and wouldn't compromise his principles even when facing down Hunsecker directly. You would think a power broker like JJ would actually admire that in a guy.But get beyond that and you have a fascinating character study of power players and manipulators at the top of their game, portrayed by actors at the top of theirs. Lancaster and Curtis are brilliant, and for Curtis at least, a departure from lightweight comic roles like Joe from \"Some Like it Hot\". The supporting cast is uniformly top notch, making their characters believable in a world filled with dishonesty and deceit.",

Burt Lancaster plays a ruthless columnist who uses his press agent (Tony Curtis) to break up his sister's relationship with a jazz musician.The movie's strength comes from several things. There's the gritty New York setting. There's the jazz soundtrack. But most important is the dialogue. Despite the physical violence that takes place in the movie, the dialogue is like salt in wounds. The line about an arsenic cookie is but one example of the cutthroat world that these characters inhabit. One of the surprises was the line about marijuana. Of course marijuana was already illegal by then, but I always assumed that no movie would've been allowed to mention the stuff.All in all, it's a masterpiece. In addition to the main cast, the supporting cast includes David White, best known as Larry Tate on \"Bewitched\". In fact, it appears that every one of his roles was in something about the corporate world.

            "content": "Throughout the history of the movies, we've seen many classics that were a box office dud in their day, only to see their reputations grow over the years. CITIZEN KANE and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE are the two most obvious examples, but there are many more. THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, Buster Keaton's THE GENERAL, PATHS OF GLORY, VERTIGO, and Erich von Stroheim's GREED also suffered from the stigma of public indifference until vindicated by posterity . THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is the most recent example I can think, greeted with a ho-hum response until word of mouth elevated its status completely. SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS was another misunderstood gem containing big name stars (Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis) and an acrid plot that was too strong for 1957 audiences. Like the other movies I mentioned, SWEET SMELL eventually took on a life of its own, becoming a Tony winning Broadway play in the 90s.SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS was the brainchild of writer Ernest Lehman, future scribe of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, WEST SIDE STORY, and THE SOUND OF MUSIC. He'd first written his treatment as a novella in the early Fifties apprenticing as a press agent's assistant. Lehman had seen the dark side of celebrity culture, and there was no doubt that SWEET SMELL's JJ Hunsecker was patterned after Walter Winchell, the foremost gossip columnist in America. Lehman knew that his story was never going to be seen on the silver screen without either a bankable star or an independent producer with a lot of moxie.....or both!Burt Lancaster was one of the first actors since the days of Chaplin, Fairbanks, and Pickford to take charge of his own creative destiny. He shrewdly alternated risky personal projects with surefire commercial hits to balance out his collateral in Hollywood. One of Lancaster's first ventures in that field was the big screen version of Paddy Chayefsky's MARTY -which he did not appear in. Its surprise success at the Oscars, which included Best Picture, considerably strengthened his credentials as a producer. When Lehman's screenplay crossed his path, Lancaster wasn't sure if it was going to turn a profit, but he knew it had to be made.Directed by Alexander Mackendrick, best known for his Ealing comedies, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS tells the story of J. J. Hunsecker and Sidney Falco. The megalomaniac Hunsecker is the most widely read gossip columnist in America with his own television show. He's got his own table at Club 21 where he conducts business and pleasure, and in most cases the two are mutual. Wielding his power like it was a lightning rod, people are anxious not to get on his bad side and shamelessly suck up to him. J. J.'s only kryptonite is his meek little sister Susie -who looks young enough to be his daughter- whom he controls so fiercely that she's terrified of antagonizing him. When she falls in love with a jazz musician who's the opposite of her brother in every way possible, Hunsecker puts on a phony fa\u00e7ade of fraternal support while secretly trying to sabotage the relationship. This is where Sidney Falco comes in.Falco (Curtis) is a sleazy press agent who'll do anything to get his clients' names mentioned in Hunsecker's widely read columns. He's so bottom rung that his office door doesn't have stenciling on the glass window; just a piece of paper with his name pasted on it. He even lives in his workplace, too. Sidney is the proxy tasked by Hunsecker to break up Susie's romance, and his failure to accomplish this has him on J. J.'s blacklist. I wondered why a big shot like Hunsecker would use someone so two-bit as Falco. Then I realized that his cruelty extends towards giving desperate people a taste of the brass ring, then vindictively snatching it away when they fail to perform to his satisfaction.",

            "review_title": "Not Really a Favourite of Mine",
            "content": "Alexander Mackendrick is widely regarded in Britain as one of our greatest film directors, especially for his work on Ealing comedies such as \"The Man in the White Suit\", \"The Ladykillers\" and, of course, \"Whisky Galore\", set in his native Scotland. There is only one thing wrong with that assessment. Mackendrick was not, by birth, a native of Scotland or anywhere else in the UK. He was actually born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Scottish parents and went to live in Scotland when he was a child. After the series of Ealing comedies came to an end he returned to work as a director in the land of his birth. \"Sweet Smell of Success\" was his first Hollywood movie.The story is a satirical black comedy set in the world of journalism, and the main characters are J.J. Hunsecker, a powerful but amoral nationally syndicated newspaper columnist, and Sidney Falco, an equally amoral press agent, who makes a living by obtaining favourable press coverage for his clients. Falco is desperate to get his clients mentioned in Hunsecker's column, something Hunsecker is willing to provide if Falco will do him a favour. Hunsecker takes a very protective attitude towards his younger sister Susan, and disapproves strongly of her boyfriend Steve Dallas, a jazz guitarist. Hunsecker is therefore prepared to give coverage to Falco's clients provided that Falco can engineer the breakup of Steve and Susan's relationship.The film was not a box-office success when first released in 1957, and although it was more popular with the critics than with the general public it did not receive any Oscar nominations. Part of the problem was that audiences were used to seeing Tony Curtis as a clean-cut young hero and were shocked to see him as the sleazy, corrupt Falco. Eyebrows might also have been raised by Burt Lancaster's character and by his very odd, almost incestuous, relationship with the attractive young Susan, almost young enough to be his daughter. It is never really explained why Hunsecker objects so strongly to Steve, a talented and promising young man with no obvious vices. Perhaps he would object to any man becoming emotionally attached to Susan. Under the Production Code a storyline dealing directly with incest would have been unthinkable, but this was about as close as Hollywood dared to get.This is one of those films whose reputation among the cognoscenti has improved over the course of time, and today it regularly ends up on lists of the top thousand, even the top hundred, movies of all time. It is not, however, a great favourite of mine, although Lancaster and Curtis are both actors I have admired for their other work and, indeed, although both give good performances here. The plot is a complicated one- my above synopsis is very much abbreviated- and, especially during the first half of the movie, not always easy to follow. Perhaps its subject-matter is too American to appeal to audiences outside the country. Powerful syndicated columnists like Hunsecker have no real equivalent in Britain, for example, and he is said to be a satirical portrait of Walter Winchell, a figure few Britons would have heard of even in 1957.The picture improves in the second half, especially in the treatment of Susan, a tragic victim caught between Falco's amorality and her brother's obsessive over-protectiveness. James Wong Howe's atmospheric noir-style cinematography is also a plus, as is Elmer Bernstein's musical score. Overall, however, I felt that the film would have benefitted from a simpler plot and a greater psychological analysis of the Hunsecker/Susan relationship. 7/10",

            "content": "Worth watching if for no other reason than the excellent atmosphere and convincing settings, \"Sweet Smell of Success\" also features two good leading performances by Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster. The story, while interesting, is rather empty, and although the movie is generally entertaining to watch, it leaves you with a feeling that something important was missing somewhere. Perhaps, though, that is at least partially by design.Regardless of what you think about the rest of the film, it would be very hard for anyone to deny how effective the atmosphere is. Many times, it is easy to feel as if you are right there watching the characters. Likewise, Curtis and Lancaster are both effective in portraying the two cads whose schemes drive the plot. They make their characters interesting enough to follow, while also making their inherent shabbiness quite clear. They do well in preventing their characters from becoming the kind of phony romanticized villains that are so overused by present-day film-makers.It could well be by deliberate, but the lack of any characters really worth caring about does reduce the impact of the story. Even the relatively sympathetic characters sometimes make some strange decisions. The story in itself is well-written and interesting, and it easily holds your attention. When it's over, though, it has really not accomplished all that much except for depicting the rather obvious faults and blunders of a set of largely objectionable and/or dull-witted characters.",

Hunsecker objects to his sister's jazz musician boyfriend and won't hesitate to engineer a smear campaign, though he uses Falco as a pawn in order to avoid direct involvement.The script is dialogue-heavy but what dialogue! The screenplay by Ernest Lehman & Clifford Odets is full of acid-tongued remarks, with most of the best lines coming from Curtis & Lancaster. However, I found the premise slightly unconvincing and the ending was a bit of a letdown considering the preceding events.Tony Curtis and especially Burt Lancaster give fine performances but the supporting cast is less than impressive. Susan Harrison, Martin Milner and Barbara Nichols are no better than average and few supporting actors stand out, Emile Meyer being a notable exception.Overall, I wasn't especially impressed by Alexander Mackendrick's direction but he did show some interesting touches from time to time. Musically, the film benefits from a jazzy score by Elmer Bernstein which is supported by music from the Chico Hamilton Quintet.In the end, I appreciated the excellent dialogue and the acting of the film's stars but I didn't really feel that the story lived up to its full potential.

When the words aren't enough, dirty cops, planted marijuana, and pummeling fists (not to mention, prostituting) come in handy for Lancaster's columnist, JJ Hunsecker, who resorts to whatever tactics are necessary in order to keep his sister (the incest part, mentioned earlier in my quick assessment of the film), Susan (Susan Harrison) by his side. JJ even has a photo of her right on his penthouse desk, which tells you exactly what she means to him\u0085it is creepy. JJ has this military haircut and mathematician glasses, talks with purpose, rarely mincing words at any time, always working an angle that typically includes damaging the rep of somebody so he can continue to thrive financially (including his visits to the finest restaurants and clubs, maintaining a sophisticated, affluent lifestyle), and continue to use frenetic, always-moving, dastardly devious yes-men (in this case, Curtis' Sidney Falco) in order to remain at the top of the hierarchy in the world of gossip and intrigue so addictive and compelling to an audience with the taste for the salacious. Curtis amazes me in the film as this snake in the grass who wakes up, moves through the day, and scurries around the city, in whatever joint that might have the goods to benefit his ambitious goal to get ahead, while Lancaster is all cold-blooded, ice-water-in-his-veins, steely-eyed, egomaniac, who wants things his way and that's it. Martin Milner (Route 66 & Adam 12), as Susan's jazz musician beau that JJ despises for potentially taking his sister away, has a crowd-pleasing moment where he tells the columnist exactly who he is really is and what he truly represents. Emile Meyer, as a bad cop JJ uses when needed, David White, as competitor of JJ's who Sidney lures to a bimbo (Barbara Nichols) he keeps in his good graces for seducing men he needs to use for purposes to further his career (and keep JJ happy), and Sam Levine as Milner's long-suffering agent (trying to keep his client employed despite the impending crises arising due to Milner's involvement with JJ's sis) round out a solid cast. Every character has a monologue or conversation containing dialogue rich with ironic, poetic, mean-spirited, blunt, pointed, or manipulative design, Sweet Smell of Success has an acidic quality that stays with you, I think. Its reputation is justified in how the film is shot, scored, acted, and orchestrated, with the development of characters (most involved in something sleazy and/or self-important) and plot (many out for themselves, using tactics that ultimately backfire) resulting in the two romantics still coming together despite all the efforts to keep them apart.",

You're a cookie full of arsenic\", and \"Your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty\". One could argue that Alexander Mackendrick's amorality tale is most remembered for its slickly written screenplay, boasting one sharp one-liner after another. However, the film also succeeds in utilizing its top-notch cast (led masterfully by Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis) set against the backdrop of an atmospheric New York City to the tune of a fittingly accompanied jazz score - never has the city appeared as charming as it does sinister, with its shadowy presence and dark undertones felt throughout the film. To immerse yourself in this film is to hypnotically experience the 'City that Never Sleeps' as a setting of estrangement, overcrowded sidewalks, excessive street noise and the smoke-filled nightclubs and bars.The story is of Sidney Falco and JJ Hunsecker. JJ is a powerful jazz columnist while Falco is an unprincipled press agent much of whose success is contingent on getting that next big story into Hunsecker's column. (\"Exactly how does a press agent work?\", a man asks him. To which Falco responds, \"A press agennt eats a columnist's dirt and is expected to call it manna\".) JJ is unhappy with his sister's latest romance with a jazz guitarist named Steve Dallas and seeks out Falco to break it up. We remember these names because these are some highly memorable characters; they talk fast, talk smart and use their charm to persuade people to do what they want from them. Together, both Curtis and Lancaster project a cynicism and otherworldly pizazz that almost transcend their own surroundings. Consider also the script's persistent attribution of its characters to dogs (\"Tell me sir, when he dies, do you think he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?\") I think what's most compelling about these characters is not so much their complete disregard for human emotion but rather how their hunger and drive for dirt on anyone will come at any cost. Both Falco and JJ are constantly scheming and conniving in their pursuit for success, that 'sweet' smell of it. It's intoxicating to them and their aggressive wordplay distracts us from the true lack of elegance these men have. At their core, their sleaze balls and toy with innocents like puppeteers as a means for personal gain. This kind of greed and narcissism is maybe more relevant today than it was back then and understandably makes this film timeless in its themes and characters. Overall, it's a black and white film whose morals are anything BUT black and white. \"I love this dirty town\", JJ states in the film's beginning. He's right about the dirty part...",

Burt Lancaster stars as JJ Hunsecker a very powerful columnist for the New York Globe and who has lots of readers to his name, asks a young press agent named Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) to break up the relationship between Hunsecker's little sister Susie (Susan Harrison) and a jazz musician named Steve Dallas (Martin Milner) while Falco tries to go even further as to framing him as a dope smoker. The film isn't a typical film noir with a private eye investigating a murder though it does have the ingredients of one. This is a movie that is truly flawless thanks to the extremely intense screenplay written by Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman, the glorious black and white cinematography by James Wong Howe, Mackendrick's direction, and all of the performances especially from Lancaster and Curtis stand out from all the rest and each of them give some of the best work of their respective careers and are truly Oscar level work that was snubbed that year. In his review of this movie Roger Ebert wrote that the relationship between the Lancaster and Curtis characters was like \"two junkyard dogs\". of which there is no better way for me to describe it. Burt Lancaster is one of my all time favorite macho men in the movies along with John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, James Stewart, Clark Gable, Liam Neeson, Harrison Ford and many others.

Like 'Citizen Kane,' it may annoy you with its artifice and politics, but there's enough richness in dialogue and production values to carry you through to the end. Let's talk about some of the out-of-the-way stuff that usually gets forgotten or overlooked. Joe Frisco--legendary vaudeville star, bowler-hatted hoofer with the \"Jewish Charleston\"; and inspiration to the Marx Brothers in the 1920s. Frisco appeared in few movies, and this is his last. He's Herbie Temple, the washed-up vaudeville comedian whom J.J. gives a plug to, and whom Sidney Falco snares as a client. Barbara Nichols--the unattractive blonde (second-string Shelley Winters) who is Sidney's working girl. Barbara appeared in dozens of movies, yet this is the only classic in which she is usually remembered. Leonard Lyons and Earl Wilson: they don't appear, though they are suggested by the two rival columnists whom Sidney tries to butter-up as alternatives to J.J. Hunsecker (presumably a Walter Winchell type). All these columnists were household names in the 50s, at least in the New York with its seven daily papers. The tragic Clifford Odets, plugging away heroically in Hollywood after a brief and blazing career as a daring leftist playwright, wrote the screenplay from the Ernest Lehman story. Odets never really got beyond the 1940s in his outlook, and this shows here, as it does in his play and screenplay, 'The Big Knife.' Here we are in 1957, and the big slur is still being a Commie. We are expected to believe that press-agent Sidney Falco can trash a jazz guitarist's career by implying Red-front associations. No no no...no one would have cared by this point. This premise, like the caf\u00e9 society setting, is too anachronistic.This deserves a remake, but set in the latter 40s rather than the 50s.But it's still a great movie, as-is.",

I thought i had been through all important and fine film noirs of 50s from Hollywood and then i saw Sweet Smell Of Success to break my personal myth. What an intelligent writing it is. I have seen many intelligently written crime noirs but this was less about crime which ultimately helped it to not look dark. And if the noir is not in dark mode then engaging factors float high and you never loose interest on the film for a moment. I just spent 96 minutes watching Sweet Smell of Success and i didn't move sight for a moment, that's what actually happened to me. I am so happy to have watched this less known film. Basically it is story of selfish men vs gentlemen, with the flourishingly written characters of Columnists, Artists, Cops and A Musician. The story is complex, it has so many scenes built intelligently and set at different places but connected to each other somehow. The planning is fantastic and interesting and it is not simple so be aware that you are not up for a simplified task. That complexity worked for me because i love watching such films and simplicity is too mainstream anyways. After great writing, the next best thing about the film is acting of all actors especially Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster, very well supported by Martin Milner and gorgeous Susan Harrison. Another major victorious thing about this film is dialogues, i remember some quotes and will keep them in mind for some time. Watch this, \"I'd hate to take a bite outta you. You're a cookie full of arsenic.\". The main two characters of the film were Evil but don't know why i enjoyed watching them and their tricks even though i wanted them to get punishment at the end. Direction is just brilliant, i don't know how to say enough but i would say, an intelligent writing like this needed and intelligent crafting and that's what Alexander Mackendrick's did. Bravo. Overall, a Must watch film for movie buffs who loves watching clever and intriguing stuff. The less known tag of this film needs to be buried, can we do it?RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "review_title": "A film full of arsenic.",
            "content": "Throughout the history of the movies, we're familiar with a lot of now considered classics that were a box office dud in their day, only to find its reputations -and audiences- grow over the years. CITIZEN KANE and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE are the two most obvious examples, but there are many more. THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, Buster Keaton's THE GENERAL, VERTIGO, PATHS OF GLORY, and Erich von Stroheim's classic silent GREED all suffered from the stigma of public indifference until vindicated by posterity. THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is the most recent example I can think of, greeted with a ho-hum response during its theatrical run until word of mouth following the home video release elevated its status considerably.SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS was another misunderstood gem that contained big stars (Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis), but also had an acrid plot and badly flawed characters which was too strong for 1957 audiences. Like the other films I mentioned, SWEET SMELL eventually took on a life of its own, later to become a Tony winning Broadway play in the 1990's.SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS was the brainchild of writer Ernest Lehman, future scribe of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, who later adapted WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF. Lehman first wrote his treatment as a novella in the early Fifties while apprenticing as a press agent's assistant. He'd seen firsthand the dark side of celebrity culture, and there was no doubt that the character of J. J. Hunsecker was patterned after Walter Winchell, the foremost gossip columnist in America. Given SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS' sordid nature,Lehman knew that it was never going to make it to the silver screen without either a bankable star or an independent producer with a lot of moxey.....or both!!!!!Burt Lancaster was one of the first movie stars since the days of Fairbanks, Pickford, and Chaplin to take charge of his creative destiny by forming his own production company. With Harold Hill as his business partner, Lancaster shrewdly alternated his risky personal projects with sure-fire commercial hits to balance out his collateral in Hollywood.One of his first ventures as a businessman was a big screen version of Paddy Chayefsky's teleplay MARTY- which he did not appear in. Its surprise success at the Oscars, which included Best Picture, strengthened his credentials as a producer. When SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS crossed his path, Lancaster wasn't sure if it was going to turn a profit....but he knew it had to be made!Directed by Alexander Mackendrick, best known for his Ealing comedies, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS tells the story of J. J. Hunsecker and Sidney Falco. The megalomaniac Hunsecker is the most widely read gossip columnist in America, with his own weekly television show to complement his articles. Club 21 has a table reserved for him where he conducts his business and pleasure, and in most cases the two are mutually intertwined. With the power to make and break a career, he wields that power like a lightning rod. People are anxious not to be on his bad side, and shamelessly suck up to him.J. J.'s only kryptonite is his meek little sister Susie -who looks young enough to be his daughter- whom he controls so fiercely that she's terrified of antagonizing him. When she falls in love with Steve Dallas, a jazz musician who's the opposite of her brother in every way possible, Hunsecker puts on a phony fa\u00e7ade of fraternal support while secretly trying to sabotage their relationship. This is where Sidney Falco comes in.Falco (Curtis) is a sleazy press agent who'll do anything to get his clients' names mentioned in Hunsecker's popular columns. He's so bottom rung that his office door doesn't have stenciling on the glass window, just a piece of paper pasted on it bearing his name in ink. Struggling to make his mark, Falco even resides in his workplace, complete with cot, because he can't afford a home of his own.Sidney is the proxy tasked by Hunsecker to break up Susie's romance, and his failure to accomplish this so far has him on J. J.'s no-contact list. I wondered why a big shot like Hunsecker would use someone as two-bit as Falco in the first place. Then I realized that his cruelty extends towards giving a desperate person a taste of the brass ring, then vindictively snatching it away when they fail to perform to his satisfaction.To get back into J. J.'s good graces, Falco uses one of Hunsecker's rivals to plant a false story about Steve being a communist sympathizer. By doing so, the libel can't be traced back to J. J. But the smear campaign only draws the lovers closer together than ever before, making Falco's position even more untenable.I'm not sure which Ealing film it was that convinced Lancaster and his producing partners to hire Mackendrick, but it was an exceptional decision. Of the many clever visual touches Mackendrick brought to SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, my favorite is the one taking place on Hunsecker's balcony. Showing the back of Lancaster's head, the frame flawlessly illustrates the level of J. J.'s megalomania as he stands on the terrace high above as he surveys his neon fiefdom below. It uncomfortably calls to mind the photos of Hitler and Mussolini also basking in the idolatry of their subjects.Lancaster acquits himself very well as the evil Hunsecker, but it's Curtis who truly stands out as the amoral Falco. After years of pretty boy roles in scores of forgettable pictures, Curtis had a part that he could sink his teeth into and show everyone how good an actor he was. It was a performance that should have netted him an Oscar nomination.Thanks to the superb black & white photography by James Wong Howe, the high end locations of Manhattan's look just as seamy as any other borough in New York. SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS absolutely qualifies as one of those films you must see before you die.",

But so much power has caused him a god complex, which never works out for good. Tony Curtis plays a petty press agent who would stop at nothing to please the famous columnist and with his help feel the \"sweet smell of success\". When the columnist's younger sister falls in love with a club's jazz musician, the two start a series of plots and blackmail in order to separate them.This late noir, from the late fifties, instead of murders and private detectives, shows us how journalists and PR agents, arrogant, unscrupulous, greedy and possessive, alter destinies as they see fit. Superb black-and-white cinematography and directing build a tense and dark atmosphere of noir, which with the fast pace of the film holds the attention from beginning to end. But the story itself is so melodramatically told and acted out, that the film eventually left a bland overall impression.7/10",

City ish,either upper or lower east side.Manhattan or no Manhattan.I give Odets credit for creating characters with a disagreeable and cold-hearted nature that seem real and at same time contrived.However if viewer is to develop a true interest in either character than some pathos is warranted,for without which,all one is left with are self-absorbed and callous individuals who cannot evoke empathy or likable concern for their characters.Therein lies the hurdle that this film never overcomes and is too deeply concerned and preoccupied to even try.Call me Ol fashioned ,but a movie that ends with a kiss or redeeming of protagonist thru trial and tribulation is more to my liking.Bombastic,cold-hearted ,gotta push,push,push social-climbing and job pandering ,big-city types are not what propel an interest in me.Too soap-operish and commonplace.And some of Odet's other work affects me the same.Half of which is either pretty good {The Country Girl,Golden Boy,Clash by Night}or too talky and plastic. Other than screenwriting,cinematography and music are first rate,although Elmer Bernstein has done far better with his talents {On the Waterfront}and James Wong Howe {Hud} to cite just a couple.The blending of these two,is however an exercise in having to put up with all the shenanigans of not at all Sweet and truly Smelly lead characters.I harken back to ,casting against type of Lancaster and Curtis,who believable play their smarmy roles given them,but begs the question why should I care?? That hurdle is never resolved and reason for my overall dislike and unfavorable rating.  2 1/2 star or 5/10 for Talky expose on Smelly success story.Dig Daddio's.",

In a span of just a few hours, this wicked wench has just managed to steer her fiance Steve and her friend Sid into apparently irreversible comas, while ruining any chance of peace of mind for her trampled upon older brother J. J. Though the horrid harlot appears to kiss J. J. more than anyone else, she relies upon fall guy Sidney to pry her off high-rise ledges. Film historians are beginning to properly recognize SWEET SMELL for the horror show that it is, as jaded Jezebel Sue seems Hell-bent about having her brains, and eating them, too. With Susie's fellow hooker Rita on hand to provide shades of comic relief, this otherwise unrelenting account of sinful Sue's shortcomings could well prove too strong for average viewers to stomach. While Susie's stench is anything but sweet, she's probably like a corpse flower, blooming only once per century.",

            "content": "Is the goodness of their actions ever questioned by the men in Sweet Smell of Success? They are all selfish, and scan their targets with steely eyes that betray their desires. They feel entitled to these things, as if a little power makes any obstacle move out of their way. Late in the film, Sidney Falco is seemingly at a moral impasse, the slimy press agent himself outraged at the lows that his boss would go to to destroy a young man's life and career. But like the whipped dog he is, Falco is instantly panting and begging when J.J. dangles the possibility of taking over the main column for an extended period of time. From this we can extrapolate that J.J. is used to snapping his fingers and quickly getting his way - and no one, not until the very end of the film, has ever stood up against him. Steve Dallas does so in a minute, almost insignificant manner, and J.J. sets his sights on obliterating him, and cannot be swayed by anyone else. His introduction is a key scene, telling us as much about him from the man himself but also how he affects the behaviour of those around him. See how Lancaster controls the table with an air of absolute authority, his gaze daring you to utter a wrong word. Observe how his thick browline glasses add deep dark furrows over his eyes, giving him the constant appearance of an oversized bully. The rest of the characters are flustered - they attempt to quickly seize any opportunity in the conversation to impress, and are disturbed by how Lancaster is unperturbed at these interruptions. Nothing can distract the king from his duties. Mackendrick is never shy about hiding his film's noir elements. James Wong Howe's photography utilises the deepest of blacks that hide depravity in every corner of the room, and focuses the key lights so that each image produces a stark contrast; see how simply a hat's shadow can make J.J. into a sinister monster. And the dialogue is snappy and distinct; maybe a little too flashy for what the hardboiled setting entails, with its smoky, jazz-filled bars, murky streets and even murkier inhabitants. But perhaps it envisions the city as J.J. sees it, the setting plucked straight from an old pulpy novel. When he stands on the rooftop and looks over his kingdom, night-time New York almost seems like a gliterry paradise, and the man who rules it almost seems like a guardian. In the end Falco gets beaten by the corrupt cops and arrested, no doubt off for a lengthy prison sentence. This makes some sense from a moral perspective, and we feel justice has been served. Susan, the angel within the dark reaches of the city, is driven to the very depths of despair, but only momentarily, and is the only one to walk away with a brighter future in mind. The sorriest of them all is J.J., who by trying to control everything has lost even himself and his sense of decency towards his family, and in the end, is the loneliest and most despondent of them all. Could we ever imagine his beginnings as a decent man, whose good intentions have spiralled into an overly obsessive and corrupt tirade? Lancaster makes it very difficult, and possible.",

A very youthful Tony Curtis plays an immoral publicity agent, Sidney Falco. In between hustling for additional clients and attempting to satisfy those who have already paid him, he attempts to keep his star client J.J. Hunsecker (played by Burt Lancaster) happy. Unfortunately Hunsecker is both extremely (and, improbably, increasingly) demanding throughout the film, as well as remarkably disparaging to Falco and other players.Falco himself is (initially) entertainingly manipulative, but the film seems to spiral beyond humour about 90 minutes in. Most of the main players either get their (just?) deserts or escape their oppressive lives, in a sour finale that almost seems more appropriate to a film noir. Maybe the film never achieved the success that (I think that) it deserved because of this perceived change in focus, from cheerful humour to extremely cynical manipulation.Immediate memories of the film? I've never seen Tony Curtis playing such a youthful character, and I've never seen Burt Lancaster play ANYTHING half as good as J.J. Hunsecker.

There is the trust in a stock's success, the trust of the weather man's forecast, and the trust in your car starting. One of the most important and overlooked is the trust in your friends. You share secrets, make promises, and stand behind them.Betrayal is the last thing one would want to do to someone you trust. In Sweet Smell of Success, the corrupt world of journalism is exposed. Publicity agent Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis, Some Like it Hot) is trying to make ends meat and his friend J. J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster, From Here to Eternity), a popular columnist, helps him by printing Falco's client's names in his column every so often. It's all about leverage when it comes to publicity in this town.In order to have Hunsecker give Falco's clients some ink, Falco must help out Hunsecker handle his sister Susan and her boyfriend Dallas. Hunsecker isn't a huge fan of Dallas so Falco needs to \"smudge\" him out of the picture. He goes to another columnist, Otis, to have some print on Dallas that could be detrimental to his career as a musician. The only way to get the press is to have Falco's very close friend Rita spend some time with Otis. Rita, whose boss is not too happy, will have Otis put in a good word about Rita. Already scandal is afoot.Director Alexander Mackendrick (The Ladykillers) uses the camera very well in this picture. Like any film noir, shadows are very useful and important to convey dark and mysterious emotions. The characters are sometimes hidden in shadow, giving them an intimidating appearance. Lighting and camera shots were one terrific achievement of the movie. Another was its script that fit like a glove to the time period. Written in a know-it-all fashion, the characters explode with gripping dialogue and make the story much more intense.Lancaster and Curtis steal the show. There deliveries are so smooth and real. Lancaster is intense as the tough-talking columnist. On the street he would be confused for just an average pencil pusher, but when he speaks, his words could pierce a tank. Curtis's character needs to be sly, selfish, and sometimes nasty. He goes above and beyond portraying Falco with such intricacy that it's possible to cheer for him and hiss at him. The character development is remarkable for both characters. In particular the part of Susan transforms from a frightened girl to an outspoken woman.Although at first the storyline might be hard to follow due to how it jumps right into Falco's conflict without much introduction, it gets incredibly involved as it progresses. After Falco and Hunsecker's first encounter on film, the movie takes off. The one-liners exchanged throughout the film are so clever and well thought out. It's an intelligent script with an \"edge of your seat\" flow. Mackendrick's adaptation of Ernest Lehman's novel is spectacular. The sights, the sounds, and the feel of the movie illuminate from the screen. It's a classic film noir and one to be treasured. Lancaster and Curtis make the movie a joy to watch. Full of suspense and an intense storyline make this film sweet to watch and a success all around.",

Times Square and other iconic locations (\"21\", Toots Shore's, 23rd & Fifth Ave.) that figure prominently are today either gone or hardly recognizable...and it wasn't all that long ago! The cars jamming those mean streets and the way people dress and behave are long gone too. But the riveting thing sitting in the audience is that you aren't witnessing some clinically researched painstaking Hollywood recreation of late 50s New York - this is the real deal...there's a documentary quality to Sweet Smell from that standpoint. Watching the film you realize we may live in New York now, but it's not the same place - not anywhere near. And viewing Sweet Smell is about as close as you're going to get to that mythical city...sorry, that's just the way it is. The music provides the right atmosphere...Bernstein and Chico Hamilton in marvelous collaboration. And the Lehman/Odets dialogue, as others have commented, just knocks you out.

He can make or break just about anyone or anything especially in New York-the capital of the Hunsecker Empire. And for a man with that much power he has a dangerous ego,he can tear you apart and he's not afraid to do so; as a matter of fact he's eager to. In many ways,even more contemptible than JJ Hunsecker is Sydney Falco. Nearly as unscrupulous as his boss,Sydney will do anything if it means giving him a leg up. Always trying to hustle something from Hunsecker or some other big shot.With a distinct look and feel that perfectly captures the themes of the film,it was the directorial debut for Alexander Mckendrick and one of the best since Citizen Kane. Speaking of Orson Welles,Burt Lancaster considered him for the role of JJ Hunsecker;the character is very similar to Charles Foster Kane and Welles probably would have been excellent in it. Nonetheless, it's incongurous to think of the film without Lancaster.\nThe script was cowritten by Ernest Lehman and Clifford Odets so I'll refrain from praising one man but I will add that the dialogue in the film is scindilating and some of the best to be spoken on screen.It's a picture about power,ethics and all the people pursuing The Sweet Smell Of Success.",

            "content": "Sweet Smell Of Success is one of the most iconic films ever to be set in New York City.And is appropriately filled with a cast of some of the most sleazy and loathsome a-holes the city has to offer...which is why it's so alluring.Throughout the film, we follow Sidney Falco (expertly played by Tony Curtis), a low-level press agent who moonlights as a crony for his gangster-columnist overseer, JJ Huchenson.Huchenson is a cutthroat columnist for a local rag, who will publish anything that will get him ahead.Likewise, Falco exploits his dashingly good looks, and crude ability to convince those around him, to get articles published in favour of his clients, who pay him to keep their names in the press in a positive light.The plot focuses around JJ attempting to break up the love affair between his sister and her guitar playing lover, Steve, who has just asked for her hand in marriage.Falco acts as Huchenson's lapdog, because he feels it's his only way to get ahead in the game...not realizing he is being set up as the fall guy...as he is being pushed to all lengths to do JJ's biding, on the promise he might get his own column one day - hence the ironic title of the film.Falco attempts to gaslight Suzy into ditching Steve, while he is being gaslit in order for JJ to achieve his ends, without looking bad in his sister's eyes.But she is too smart for them both...and things don't exactly play out as they are planned.The whole fiasco is chock full of harsh and abusive street vernacular, making for some of the most intriguing dialogue you'll ever hear in film.It's only fault is really the rather abrupt ending, which I feel could have been drawn out a bit longer, with a little more elaboration...but that is a petty beef, that doesn't take away from the rest of the film.On the flipside, what I love about the ending...is that, in a film full of villains, the victim of their whims is the one who comes out on top at the end.A rather refreshing- and unexpected- twist, from your typical noir.Having love win, in a scenario that otherwise takes place in the darkest holes of the underbelly of that dirty city.Such a classic...that offers a timecapsule glimpse of New York City, that has since been lost.8 out of 10.",

            "content": "The 'Sweet Smell of Success' is a lesson in how power corrupts, and absolutepower corrupts absolutely. Burt Lancaster plays J.J. Hunsecker, a powerful, Walter Winchell-likenewspaper columnist, who, with the stroke of his typewriter keys, can, and often does, destroy people's reputations. J.J., as he likes to be known, has a younger sister, Susan. J.J. has a proprietary hold over her, believing that he knows best when it comes to how she lives her life. Susan wants to marry jazz musician Steve Dallas, but J.J. doesn't approve, and is determined to break up the relationship. Tony Curtis, in one of his best performances, plays Sidney Falco, a publicist , whose job is to supply 'items of information' to people like J.J. Hunsecker - especially to J.J. Hunsecker. The film is basically told from Sidney's perspective, as it follows him around, by turn fawning over J.J. to turning like a trapped rat, on anyone who dares tocontradict J.J., including J.J.'s sister. No character in this film has any redeeming quality. They are all so left centred as to seem like a parody of what people think people like them act like. Perhaps that was intentional - perhaps not. The very cold-bloodied way the actors handle their parts, is I think, what makes this film work for me. The complete lack of emotion, and the characters love/hate relationship towards each other andthose around them, makes for powerful cinema. This film was directed by Alexander McKendrick, who, just two years earlier,directed 'The Ladykillers', one of the funniest comedies to come out of Ealing Studios.",

The quips are witty and roll from the actors like venom off a snake's tongue. It's all that the clunky writing of Sin City wanted to be and so much more.It's so good I named my website after a line from the script.All of the performances are of a high quality and it just shows how much actors revel in great dialogue. Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster never really impressed me as actors until I saw this film, then they both leap frogged into my top ten. The main characters are all fairly despicable but manage to seem redeemable throughout.A great jazz soundtrack and the lights of night time New York are captured in exquisite black and white.This film's perfume is definitely success.",

The first 20 minutes or so were kind of slow in presenting all the characters, but once the on going insults and drama start it gets very entertaining.My only problem with it was how anti-climatic the ending was, it left me wanting more, much more.

The lead character is a P. R. agent and he's generally referred to as the scum of the earth and thoroughly hated on throughout the movie. Nowadays it's a standard position in the media game, but back then when it was new it was this sleazy thing generally perceived as equal with being a con-artist. This movie is from the 50's so it was really eye-opening to witness that, but beyond that I did find the movie to mostly be a little vapid and redundant.The lead actor Tony Curtis puts in a strong performance, effectively portraying one of the earliest cases of a proper anti-hero that I can think of, but I didn't find the movie's overall payoff particularly enthralling or even very memorable.

It had a quiet mis-en-scene about it and I really enjoyed the immediacy of the contrasting lighting of the scene.

            "content": "Film noirs usually don't dip into favorite territory for me and this film wasn't an exception to that, but I do enjoy it quite a bit and it held up well when I rewatched it.Interestingly enough though, it barely qualifies as a noir. Noir isn't an easily defined genre and a number of definitions of the term exist, but an integral plot point which remains consistent throughout the genre is that the film in question needs to involve a clear and identifiable crime. While some of the characters in this film have corrupt morals, they operate within the law throughout much of the film and a major crime isn't introduced until about an hour or so in. It's in this way, by refusing to define a major crime till the final act, that Sweet Smell of Success redefines the rules of the genre.I think noirs are reliant on the quality of their dialogue more than all other genres and Sweet Smell of Success doesn't disappoint on that front. In terms of classic noirs, it doesn't quite have my favorite dialogue (I'd give that designation to Out of the Past), but it still comes with plenty to enjoy. The script is packed with a handful of well-placed and biting remarks which add stakes to the less dramatic moments in the first couple acts, ensuring that you remain engaged all throughout the film. I appreciated the dialogue when I first watched this film and I found more to like about the script with my second viewing.Tony Curtis does a great job as Sidney Falco, a press agent determined to break apart the romance between Steve and Susan. He's willing to do anything to accomplish the task, including spreading lies about Steve and betraying his friends. Burt Lancaster does a similarly great job as J. J. Hunsecker, a major media kingpin who's unscrupulous, vindictive, and just as bad as Falco, if not worse. Steve and Susan act as contrasts to the two of them as they're both good people, albeit powerless against them. The conflict amongst the four of them resides on a fairly low stakes level of intensity in the first couple acts before spiraling out of control in the final act. By way of the complex characters and the aforementioned dialogue, I think the film attempts to add stakes to the first couple acts, but this choice didn't always work for me. Pretending that the first couple acts had higher stakes than they actually did was (occasionally) disconcerting. This blend eventually came together though in the final act.Overall, I'm glad I got to rewatch this film as my memory of it from a few years ago was pretty poor. Again, I wouldn't say this film dips into favorite territory for me, but I did enjoy it quite a bit and I can see myself watching it again down the road.",

Love is shattered, deals to make sure it happens for good are agreed upon by none other than the sweet innocent Suzy's brother who doesn't want to ever part with her. He wants to keep her in his life and be close with her because she's all he's got in terms of family, and he's willing to destroy the true love her sister had been lucky enough to find while still under his wing.

Ernest Lehman's script crackles with snide comments and sarcastic monologues, and everything is photographed in chilling shades of grey. The characters in this film may have few redeeming features, but Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis rarely turned in better performances.",

The movie's music is a delight.This movie has too many machinations. Burt Lancaster seems to be the strategist and Curtis the tactician. My head swam. Underneath all, I could understand but I couldn't fathom their business. Why are these guys struggling to be Number One? What's the point? -Spoiler- Protect a sister? Earn respect? Get lots of money? Is this a pseudo-documentary on public relations? The work of a gossip columnist?Final points: The decent guy, the Fifth Business/foil/love object to propel the plot, is one of the Adam-12 TV-show cops.

Tony Curtis's character is trying to help out J.J who is played by Burt Lancaster, who does a great job of being a scary jerk like in the rest of his movies. And J.J's little sister, Susan. They really tried to make Lancaster look scary in this movie and dark so they used very dark lighting with scenes of Lancaster. I thought this was a good a movie, and it had many shots of the city, the photography was really great. This was my first time watching a Tony Curtis film and I thought he did really good in this movie and opposite of Burt Lancaster. I would highly recommend watching this Tony Curtis film.",

Curtis' portrayal is BRILLIANT.Burt Lancaster as the ruthless columnist and Martin Milner as the honest arrow of a jazz musician are a metaphor for good and evil - they are also riveting to watch.The dialog throughout is poisoned and very effective: \"I'd hate to take a bite out of you...you're a cookie full of arsenic!\" If you love jazz and Manhattan \"the way it was,\" this is a MUST-SEE.",

            "content": "\"Sweet Smell of Success\" follows scummy people doing a scummy job and exploits them for what they do. Sidney Falco is a publicist who works for a newspaper writer named J.J. Hunesecker. Sidney Falco has almost no regard for other human beings, and that's because his job demands it. It's a job that rewards his greed, selfishness, and backwards morals. He plays everyone against everyone, no one is truly his friend, but somehow no one is truly his enemy. Everyone is just viewed as a tool he can use to rise to the top.J.J. Hunesecker keeps everyone below him, because in order to stay on top in his job, he has to. J.J.'s fatal flaw, however, is that he cares about one person and let's that person control (or influence) his actions. And the fact that his fatal flaw is that he cares about someone more than himself obviously shows the business him and Sidney work in and the kind of person J.J. had to be to rise to the position he's in. But J.J. gets carried away in the one person he let's himself care about, and he becomes obsessed with her to the point that he won't let anyone else have her. But eventually J.J. ends up bringing everyone else down with him. The film satirizes the media by showing that they are even worse than the people that they chastise, and we listen to them because we blindly believe that whatever we see in the news is fact. This creates a cycle where they keep getting paid to be jerks because we keep buying their papers, and the more we buy, the more they can get away with.The film's fast dialogue and general fast pace resembles how fast Sidney's world moves and how fast he needs to think in order to survive in his job, and one of the major strengths of the film is how there is always something happening in it. This film isn't dull for a second and the fast, witty dialogue make it genuinely entertaining from beginning to end, which is something I can't say for most films. But beyond pure entertainment, nearly every character in the film (and there are many) is interesting and follows a believable character arc, and on top of that, it's commentary on the media makes it truly one of the best film noirs of all time.",

            "content": "This movie could be easily dubbed \"The Battle of the Immorals.\" Two loathsome individuals, the powerful tabloid columnist J. J. Hunsecker (an offshoot of Charles Foster Kane and a precursor to Rupert Murdoch) and his fawning press agent Sidney Falco (\"match me, Sidney!\") plot to break up the romance between Hunsecker's 19-year old sister Susie and talented and popular jazz guitarist Steve Dallas. Hunsecker, whose sole ambitions are money and power, is consumed with the break up and the press agent, whose small apartment doubles as his office, is eager to get in on that wealth and power.The reason for the obsession with breaking up \"the kids\" is never explicitly mentioned - perhaps it was too taboo a subject to mention incest, but that certainly could play a part. More likely, it's that Dallas is all about jazz and the arts. So it's not too far-fetched an idea when Hunsecker devises a scheme to brand Dallas a communist (this film came out a few years after the McCarthy era). Any American with an interest at the time in the arts, which encouraged independent thought, was deemed a communist, and Hunsecker certainly could have been a player in the witch hunts under the infamous Wisconsin Senator.When Susie gets wind of this plot, she carefully constructs a plan of her own to escape the clutches of her sick and possessive brother and into the arms of Dallas. This culminates in a finale in the apartment of J. J. and Susie with Sidney serving as a pawn for both siblings. And despite the bitter pill the story is, it does have a somewhat happy ending.Ernest Lehman co-wrote the screenplay, based on his own novella, along with left-wing playwright Clifford Odets. Hitchcock apparently loved the film, and hired Lehman to write the screenplay for his upcoming spy movie North by Northwest. The cinematography captures a real sense of time and place - Manhattan in the late '50s, Times Square adorned with flashy neon signs advertising everything from Admiral electronics to a Grand Union supermarket. Certainly not the Times Square of today. And as the case with any great film noir, the light and the shadows cast a spell over the film.J. J. Hunsecker is widely considered to be one of Burt Lancaster's signature performances. His plotting, controlling, cynical character is a far cry from Elmer Gantry, another memorable Lancaster performance the world would see 3 years later. But even Hunsecker is not blind to Sidney Falco's complete lack of moral compass. An individual who will cross anyone in order to get ahead: \"You're a cookie full of arsenic. I'd hate to take a bite out of you.\" This is one of Tony Curtis's greatest dramatic performances. Despite his slimy behavior, he elicits a bit of sympathy, especially during the climax, when both J. J. and Susie use him as a \"patsy\" to get what they want.The one minor quibble is the lack of humor in the film. It is stone cold serious. Some black humor would have been welcome. Perhaps there is black humor in the film yet only the most cynical viewer will find it.",

Fortunately, we've moved from this naivete so that this film now gets the recognition it is due. Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster give stellar performances. I like Susan Harrison too. You might have wondered, like me, how it is you've never seen her in other movies. She retired from acting in 1963, just six years after this movie was made. Clifford Odets contributed to the screenplay, and it's he we can probably thank for much of the hard-boiled dialogue. It sounds tough, but not illiterate. You have the crooked cop say, \"Come back, Sidney, I want to chastise you\" and the cigarette girl uses the word \"Consequently,\" but it all somehow sounds believable. The direction by. Alexander Mackendrick (who also is credited with the screenplay in addition to Ernest Lehman, the author of the original story) is very fine.

Stories about cynicism often succumb to their subject-matter and become merely cynical themselves. This one never does, no matter how repulsive the subject: the sordid muck of newspaper tittle-tattle, the publicity agents that peddle the muck and the columnists who climb the heap. There are a fistful of great performances here: Burt Lancaster, the maniacal columnist, Susan Harrison as his vulnerable sister, and, especially, Tony Curtis, the publicity agent of whom Lancaster's character remarks: \"I wouldn't want to take a bite out of you; you're a cookie filled with arsenic\". But still and all \u2013 and this is the quality that marks out Curtis's performance as his greatest on film \u2013 a cookie, a guy who attracts as well as repels, a guy who poisons us like a bad habit. Filmed by the great James Wong Howe, scored by Elmer Bernstein, with a cracking good script by Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman, and featuring some great location sequences in mid-50s New York, this is a brilliant study in self-deception and mass manipulation.",

I believed his only two good performances were in The Defient Ones and, of course, Some Like It Hot. Now I have to add Sweet Smell Of Success.Sweet Smell Of Success is about a lowly press agent, Tony Curtis, who had a deal with a big columnist, Burt Lancaster, that has fallen through due to Curtis' inability to stop Lancaster's sheltered sister from seeing a jazz guitarist. But, when Curtis decides to give it another try, he finds out that success isn't all it's cracked up to be. The performance by Curtis marked a career high, fresh off of The Defient Ones, and a couple years away from Some Like It Hot. Curtis gives a great performance here, his Sidney Falco is a smarmy, seedy press agent, who will do anything for publicity. Anything.Burt Lancaster plays J.J. Hunsecker, second only to Waldo Lydecker and Addison Dewitt for the best on-screen columnist. Lancaster dosen't play the part with an above-everyone-else air, unlike most film columnist's. Here J.J. is smart, but volatile, tough, but soft. He'll do anything to keep his sister to himself. It's one of Lancaster's best performances. The sister, played by Susan Harrison, is sheltered and does everyone thing her brother says, except avoid falling in love. her relationship with a jazz guitarist provides a great backbone to the story. Harrison is wonderful here.The film dosen't follow the usual restraints of Film Noir. There's no big controversy, no femme fatale, no private detective, no falcon. Instead there are everyday people, doing their everyday jobs, that's what makes this film unique. The cinematography is excellent, the score is the perfect combination of jazz and suspense. The performances are excellent, and the direction by Aexander Mackendrick is above par. However, you can't make a great Noir without atmosphere, and that is something Sweet Smell Of Success never lacks. If you haven't seen it watch it. If you have seen it, watch it again.

A cynical, manipulative, god-like New York gossip columnist called JJ Hunsecker who fawning press agents, senators and others fear, he is fawned on by Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis in one of his best roles) who hopes to get to the top, and like his mentor, doesn't mind what he does to people in the process. Even his secretary Jeff Donnell feels the sharpness of his cynicism and at one point is told to accept that his world is the real world.Hunsecker's kid sister (Susan Harrison) has fallen for a jazz guitarist (Martin Milner, later of TV's Route 66) but brother JJ does not approve and wants Falco to break it up, cutting him out when Falco initially tries and fails. Desperate to get back into JJ's grand circle, Falco hatches a nasty little scheme which ultimately goes wrong, eventually resulting in Hunsecker and Falco both coming to grief. Lancaster and Curtis are riveting while on screen, a double act involving mutual dependence, punctuated by some of the best dialogue written for any film. But its not just the dialogue, but the photography, music, the playing and New York itself which together make this such a memorable picture, one of director Mackendrick's best. He made classic British comedies Whisky Galore, The Maggie and The Ladykillers among others, all of which, together with Sweet Smell of Success, rely on characterisation to move on the plot and hold your attention.Emile Meyer as a slimy cop and Barbara Nichol as a put-upon blonde are also memorable in the cess-pit media world inhabited by JJ and his cronies.One to remember.",

And there was the beautiful female, who was the fulcrum to the whole movie. She was the main headline for eighty percent of the characters that had an impact in the film. I would love to watch this movie with a bunch of Italian taxi drivers for some reason",

It's one of my Top 10 from the 50s because it is so successful in making the characters come alive. Lancaster's cold, even sadistic nature is shocking yet entirely believable, while Curtis' sycophantic, amoral performance as the groveling p.r. flack begging crumbs from Burt's gossip columnist's table is one of his best.From the opening scene to the end, the noirish music, the stark, gritty exterior shots and the unsparingly lit interiors, the sharp-pointed dialogue, and the powerful acting, this one lives with me and leaves me looking forward to the next viewing!",

Tony Curtis in his best and most definitive dramatic role as a hustling, conniving press agent paying court and doing favors for Burt Lancaster as a sinister, unscrupulous columnist with an unhealthy (to say the least) determination to break up his younger sister's romance with jazz musician Martin Milner. Curtis is completely convincing in every scene, every word, every expression. Hard to imagine any actor--then or now---better suited for this part; this film-- and \"The Defiant Ones in 1958---marked Curtis's transition (for a while) from teen heart throb to serious dramatic actor. The dialog is arch and richly stylized with many famous lines (\"I'd hate to take a bite out of you Sidney, you're a cookie full of arsenic\"); garish, depraved, devious, decadent, despicable and totally delightful; not much of a hit when it was first released it gained a loyal following over the years and is now considered by some critics (and yours truly) to be one of the best movies of the 50's. Photographed in glorious black and white by James Wong Howe on the teeming nighttime streets of Times Square and the New York nightclub district (in part while a chronically hung over Odets was frantically rewriting scenes inside a prop truck and sending them over to the set by messenger). Based on Ernest Lehman's novella. Lehman had worked at one time as assistant to a Broadway press agent who was a close associate of Walter Winchell----for many years the best known, most influential and most feared of all gossip columnists",

Filled with excellent script (mainly dialogue), great performances, top-notch score, exquisite direction and a great morality theme.It is a film about corruption in the journalistic system and the dirty truth hidden behind the powerful. The payoff of the film is quite interesting since the film ran away from the conventional ending. It is surprising how injustice is aimed at those who least deserve it.Tony Curtis makes one of the most likable protagonists I have ever seen (after all, which character is not sensational here?) The way in which he is treated as a minor, as a mere press officer by his superiors is portrayed in a significant way. Burt Lancaster as JJ Hunsecker plays what may well be one of my favorite movie characters. Several supporting characters are of great importance, and they all seem to be equally a positive force in this film. The \"problem\" that is Steve's involvement and JJ's sister is a big 'test' of the characters' morality, resulting in a big influence on all of them. Themes like \"I will win a materialistic prize if I commit this bad deed\" or \"I want someone innocent exterminated because I don't want my sister to be happy\" and so on.As I said before, the dialogues are of the highest quality. Not only the scenes of that skilfully written conversation between Sidney Falco, JJ and other politicians, or not just in the final verbal confrontation of JJ and Steve, but as in the whole film, the dialogue is entirely great.The direction is very good. There are several scenes with excellent sequential shots where the editing is consistent.In the end, Sweet Smell of Succes is a master of a film noir that explores evil, intolerance and journalistic corruption. Containing great writing, great direction, acting and great themes of corruptive morality, it is a masterpiece of cinema noir and one of the great films of the 1950s, one of the best in the history of cinema.",

            "content": "In all of cinema's history, it is hard for me to think of a film that is so great of a sleeper.  While it has achieved a small reputation among film buffs in the years since then (Entertainment Weekly listed it as the 49th best film of all time), it has not ballooned in a noted film classic like some initial flops (\"Touch of Evil\").  This is unfortunate, because \"Sweet Smell of Success\" is one of the greatest films, period, and probably the best film of the 50's save \"The Manchurian Candidate\".  It positively oozes with sleazy atmosphere, perfectly recreating the New York nightlife of columnists, press agents, quasi-celebrities, and cigarette girls.  And the screenplay has enough memorable, snappy dialogue to make your head spin. The cinematography is quite impressive, and the camera is always used to the greatest effect without trying to blitz you with tricks like many modern-day films.  The acting is superb all around, especially the leads Tony Curtis, as a smarmy press agent with the \"scruples of a guinea pig and the morals of a gangster\", and Burt Lancaster, as a powerful, cold-hearted gossip columnist whose only soft spot is his sister.  Yet what really holds this film together and sets it apart is the harsh moral tale at the core.  What price will Sidney Falco (Curtis) have to pay to taste the \"sweet smell of success\"?  See the film (more than once to soak it all up) and dissect it for yourself.",

If the subject wasn't the control of persons and information, at least one character managed to end happily, and the cigarette smoke and other staples of noir cinematography weren't so seductive, the effect might be entirely comic. I dare anyone to compare the two instances in which J.J. asks Falco for a light -- the one at 21, and then again before J.J.'s show airs -- and tell me that everything between the two frames isn't skillfully contrived to increase the comic effect, daring us to keep laughing as terrible events spiral out of control. Plenty of other examples are proof for this, but I won't spoil them. Just rent it, and keep your eyes peeled. It's not just Walter Winchell who gets sent up: it's the entire genre, guffawing and crying at the same magical time -- all according to a lost movie lexicon that, pushed far enough, can't help but mock itself.

            "content": "Sweet Smell of Success is a film about the value of morality in an age where getting to the top is the be-all and end-all of life and, as such, is the most scathing deconstruction of the American Dream of the 1950's, an era of overwhelming commie-bashing and rampant patriotism/nationalism. Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) is the embodiment of this type \u2013 a press agent who'll back-stab, sell-out and jump through hoops just to make it big. For him, that sweet smell is everything, but he's not as detached as he'd like to believe; his despicable actions make him uncomfortable and reduce him to a state of self-loathing, which makes him lash out at anyone who'd try to help or change him. He needs to get to the top \u2013 even if he isn't sure why. This is the American Dream. Already at the top is J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster), an angry, intimidating newspaper editor who fits the classic definition of \"evil\". He will destroy anyone he feels like, for his own satisfaction. He has reached the top and has absolute power over his writers, the police, his readers and everyone else he meets. Remind you of anyone? So when anyone disputes that power, such as when his sister Susan (Susan Harrison) begins a relationship with a jazz guitarist Martin (Martin Milner) and threatens to leave, he steps on anything and anyone to get that power back. Sidney and J.J.'s relationship is classic sadomasochism \u2013 Sidney disgusts J.J. and makes him the constant focus of his abuse, even while Sidney acts like a puppet on a string for him; Sidney takes this abuse with without defence \u2013 perhaps because he feels he deserves it. Susan and Martin are the only characters in the film not to embrace the rat race and they are, as a result, run over. Sweet Smell of Success was directed by Scottish director, Alexander Mackendrick and is a harsh, hilarious and cynical look at the pathetic scrabble for power that is the bedrock of capitalist society. Not too surprisingly, the screenplay was co-written by blacklisted communist writer Clifford Odets. The film is a visual and aural feast too \u2013 the sumptuous black and white New York location footage combines with a smoky Chico Hamilton jazz score and the result is one of the most atmospheric portrayals of the Big Apple and the people inside it. It is a film about small men who want to be big and big men who really are much smaller than they think. Dig it, rasclart!",

In the figure of J.J. Hunsecker portrayed with calculating coldness by Burt Lancaster we see an amalgamation of Charles Foster Kane's formidable megalomania and Michael Corleone's monstrous adherence to an unforgiving moral code, all appropriately buttressed by the smoky and frenetic milieu of the New York jazz scene. Tony Curtis in turn creates a peculiar counterpoint to Lancaster's domineering presence in the form of a sniveling sycophant, ever chomping at the bit to make a quick buck regardless of the degree of amorality involved. \"Sweet Smell of Success\" thus stuns us with the bitter irony of its title in its scorching portrayal of success that reeks as much as ever with the rotten stench of corruption and phony grandeur.",

            "content": "A bleak world of gritty realism and salacious dealings.\n\nAlexander Mackendrick's noir drama Sweet Smell of Success (1957) is a gripping black and white picture about how greed, capitalism, and power will allow a person to abandon morality and ethics completely for the almighty dollar. It's a parable warning against greed, cruelty, and manipulation for if you lose your integrity, you may never get your good name back. Tony Curtis is sublime as the slimy publicity agent Sidney Falco literally willing to do anything for a spot as a newspaper columnist, no matter who gets hurt. Curtis plays a real selfish jerk, who uses everyone around him to achieve such a small worthless dream. It's a masterclass in Tony Curtis' gazes of admiration or disgust at each character.\n\nBurt Lancaster is unreal as the controlling, gaslighting, creep older brother J.J. Hunsecker, willing to twist reality in order to maintain his ungodly control over his abused sister. Lancaster is such a revolting lecher, you'll hardly believe his crass manner of rude insults and insufferable arrogance to all in earshot. You will hate Lancaster by the end of this magnificent role.\n\nSusan Harrison is endearing and sympathetic as Susan Hunsecker, the clearly abused young sister to Burt Lancaster's all powerful brother J.J. Her hurt eyes and body language make you melt into sorrow. Harrison is very natural and realistic in Sweet Smell of Success. She sells you on the damage men like J.J. inflict and men like Sidney make excuses for endlessly. Similarly, Barbara Nichols is a revelation of melancholia as her poor cigarette girl Rita is tossed to predatory men like she's nothing. There's a particularly heinous scene of gross sexism that makes your blood boil and Nichols makes your heart sink into oblivion.\n\nErnest Lehman and Clifford Odets' writing is stuffed with mature wisdom, cautionary tales, seedy crimes, grotesque treatment of women, and the callous men that use them. Sweet Smell of Success' script is unique in that every single line has some deeper meaning, euphemism, significance, double entendre, or unbelievable wit. You'll be engaged just by the clever dialogue, let alone the harrowingly depressing narrative about a revolting perverse brotherly love forbidding a genuine romance.\n\nAlexander Mackendrick's direction is striking with a focused storytelling and shocking maturity for dark subject matter. Sweet Smell of Success is endlessly entertaining with Mackendrick's directorial tricks to keep you enjoying all the misery and manipulation along the way. It's amazing how daring Mackendrick was to make this timeless classic that is so revealing about newspaper men, publicity agents, and millionaire tycoons today as it was back upon its release. Alan Crosland Jr.'s editing is slick with neat cuts from faces to juxtapose the gaslit and the gaslighter. His classy cuts keep Sweet Smell of Success to a savory 97 minutes of pure pain and cinematic bliss.\n\nJames Wong Howe's stunning cinematography is impressively technical with smooth panning shots, yet it's his unique framing of Tony Curtis' face reacting to everyone insulting him and the horrible things unfolding in front of him, that he causes mind you, and he just doesn't care. Howe uses the black and white aesthetic to highlight and obscure faces with shadows and silhouettes in every scene, while he ensures all close-ups focus on the eyes of the subject to get their perspective on the tragedy before them. Mary Grant's suits are stylish and the dresses are all so pretty and fitted perfectly to each lady. Robert J. Schiffner gives Tony Curtis these dark eye make-up that makes him look perpetually tired and driven by his insatiable desire for status and currency.\n\nElmer Bernstein's score features exciting and playful jazz with moody numbers throughout Sweet Smell of Success. His music adds a New York authenticity and murky vibe that keeps you on edge for all the conservative actions and plotting on screen. The music is surprisingly light despite the bleak themes and black humor to all the suffering caused by an obsessed newspaper CEO and his sycophantic toadie. You hear the chaotic jazz and haunting theme crescendoing into despair as the film goes on to the bittersweet end. \n\nIn conclusion, Sweet Smell of Success has brilliant direction and gorgeous cinematography that's so creative, you'll be thinking about the crafty filmmaking as much as the stomach churning tale of woe herein.",

            "content": "Sweet Smell of Success immediately stands apart in the film noir genre thanks to quick and clever dialogue, similar to that of screwball comedies but communicating darker and more menacing ideas. The language of the characters is filled with metaphors and subtle understandings between those conversing so it wouldn't be hard to miss important comments, hidden among the fancy language, but the way the actors clearly and believably deliver their lines paired with the refreshing simplicity of the plot keep that from happening. While the plot is straightforward, the characters' inner struggles are more complex and it is through the creative dialogue that we learn not only how the characters really feel but also how they want others to think they feel. Burt Lancaster's JJ Hunsecker even says that Tony Curtis' Sidney Falco has 40 faces to conceal what he really wants and to help him get it. Falco is the opposite of what we expect from handsome, likable Curtis so from the onset, he's deceived even us but throughout the film we see him go lower and lower as he tries to reach the top. Though an unusual role for Curtis, it is one where he can really show his skills and give one of his best performances. Lancaster is cast against type as well and plays the role of manipulative columnist and frighteningly overprotective brother better than his usual buff hero. Hunsecker's sweet and fragile sister, played forlornly by Susan Harrison, and her righteous jazz musician boyfriend, played confidently by Martin Milner, are two lone points of light in the shadowy city streets of New York as all the characters around engage in immoral and selfish acts. The film depicts multiple relationships between family, friends, lovers, and enemies, all with an understanding of how they shift and change as circumstances do. Falco and Hunsecker's friendship is the most intriguing as they often seem at odds, even hostile, and business is ever their priority. Even with these tense relationships and multiple acts of violence, there is never a murder, something one would think almost essential to a film noir. However, the movie is stronger without it as we get to see the effects of each dirty decision played out on all the characters involved. It still has distinctly film noir elements including entrancing black and white cinematography and a cool jazz score.",

            "content": "On a subjective level, I really liked this. On an objective level, this is pretty much a perfect movie. Ahead of its time in nearly all aspects, Sweet Smell of Success is a groundbreaking classic. It's no surprise that this bombed at the box office upon initial release; audiences weren't ready for this level of advanced storytelling.\n\nWith nearly zero violence or action, this movie manages to be engaging from beginning to end. I was glued to the screen by virtue of its snappy, razor sharp dialogue. Aside from Steve and Susan, almost every character in this piece is a scummy sleaze bag of some sort. There's so many moments of dishonesty, deceit, lying, greed, you name it. It can be pretty downbeat once you realize this is no fairy tale, but rather a non-sugarcoated commentary on the harsh reality of power-hunger and control. The seedy underbelly of journalism has never been this fascinating.\n\nIt's a relentless movie, both in its characters and lighting fast pace. Not a single shot or scene is wasted thanks to the condensed, airtight screenplay. The soundtrack needs mention too. The use of Jazz music contributes to the film's distinctive personality. The photography, fluid camera usage and lighting deserve credit as well. There isn't a single scene shot during the day, which makes sense; a world as nefarious as this should be accompanied by the darkness of night. What also needs mention is the aggressive dynamics between characters. Every argument and quarrel is executed with utter intensity.\n\nLittle details like the reactionary facial expressions and body language add to the effortlessly effective performances too. Many black & white films contained great, though admittedly theatrical, performances. While this has a modicum of that aspect, for the most part the performances are far more grounded in reality. This aspect too I found to be ahead of its time. Lancaster and Curtis burn up the screen together. Even if their characters are bad, bad people, I couldn't help but be captivated by their smooth, arrogant ways of talking and carrying themselves.\n\nAs icing on the cake, from my movie watching experience, many of the aforementioned aspects I've praised have been used in films released after this. So it's no surprise this movie's as influential as it is. Even if I wasn't emotionally involved 100% of the time due to the overflow of corrupt characters and bleak subject matter, there's really no glaring complaints I have about the film as a whole.",

Incredibly enthralling as you get pulled into a very realistic cut-throat world where nothing gets done without a quid pro quo, kindness is a rarity and there seems no escape from the influence of the main protagonists.\n\nQuite engaging - you feel for the characters and your loyalties change as the facts change and people reveal their true selves through their actions.  \n\nThe movie is rounded off by an excellent performance by Burt Lancaster as JJ Hunsecker.  He's a manipulative, unscrupulous villain in a suit and revels in the role.  Genuinely scary.",

As a result he tries to help a gossip columnist, played by Burt Lancaster, to break up the columnist's sister and her boyfriend. Yes, it is an entire film that revolves around a jealous brother who doesn't want to share his sister. Yet somehow the tone of the film and stellar performances by the actors elevates the simple story to be something better. It has a great look, and feels like it is an accurate depiction of life on the streets. The cinematography is stellar and I really feel the passion in all the lead actors. Tony Curtis is particularly slimy and unscrupulous, and even when he's in the background of a scene you can sense his feelings about what is going on. Perhaps one of the hardest scenes to watch is when he tries to act as pimp for another columnist by whoring out his girlfriend. I did struggle to enjoy Sweet Smell of Success, though, and not just because of that scene. It seemed that virtually every character was so overblown and dishonest that I really didn't like anyone in the film. It's tough to care when bad people are fighting with other bad people. However the real dilemma I had with this film is the dialogue. It was coming so rapid-fire that I struggled to follow along. Also they spoke in such elaborate prose that it was disingenuous and inauthentic. Real human beings don't speak in that kind of language, no matter what era this film took place in, and it seriously threw me off at times. I'd probably watch Sweet Smell of Success again if asked, and a second time through I might catch the rest of the dialogue I missed the first time, but it's not one that I feel any particular need to revisit despite the solid performances.",

Hunsecker - a thinly veiled version of Walter Winchell. In a different time (1940s and 1950s), newspaper columnists commanded immense persuasive power, careers were built up and torn down overnight usually depending on the whims, grudges, or favors of a particular noted columnist or editor. Columnists can't be everywhere at once and they depend on a network of spies, interns, and friendly public officials to feed them information. Enter Tony Curtis' character Sidney Falco, a sleazy, neurotic, hounding press agent who is a slave to Hunsecker's will. Falco falls out of favor and will do anything to get Hunsecker's ear again; including selling his dignity, which he does over and over again. Hunsecker and Falco are positively medieval in their treatment of people's feelings even concerning members of their own family, such as Hunsecker's love-struck kid sister who has fallen for the wrong type of man (a guitar player) in Hunsecker's opinion. Hunsecker is played by Burt Lancaster, but despite Lancaster's best efforts this is Tony Curtis' film all the way. Lancaster is known for his diverse performances, but Curtis completely breaks type. Curtis shows audiences he can do more than romantic comedies. Undoubtedly a hectic film to shoot, Lancaster's firm produced the film and the cast and crew knew all too well the tyrannical nature of Lancaster as producer. Director Alexander Mackendrick pulls off a difficult script in short order with Clifford Odets re-writing almost all the dialogue and delivering it to the actors as soon as it came off the typewriter.",

The key with that film is how 100% committed writer/director Dan Gilroy is to, not only follow through with his character and his storyline to the final credits, he actually doubles-down!\n\nHere, screenwriter / original novella writer Ernest Lehman first created two of the most reprehensible, irredeemable characters in film history. They are truly awful, Godless people. Then, [SPOILER] he bizarrely decides late in the film to punish them both for their villainy. First of all, it completely undercuts everything that came before. Castrating their evil comes across as though you as a writer weren't committed to it in the first place. Second, the way it is done is confusing and clumsy. Plus, it's quick and results in an abrupt ending to the film. [END SPOILER]\n\nThis is something that separates the men from the boys when it comes to film.

I felt his character was a tad over-the-top, however, as per usual for many of Lancaster's characters.  Though he is seedy in his own right, Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) is almost the protaganist of the film.  Though he is completely consumed with making a buck, even at the expense of an innocent person, there's a kind of sense of redemption you want him to experience.  Alas, the angle about  Hunsecker wanting his sister to break off her relationship with jazz musician Steve Dallas (Martin Milner of Adam-12 fame) wasn't really explored too in-depth as it pertains to the origin.  Did Hunsecker just not like Dallas?  Did he not like anybody who would date his sister?  Or something else?",

First off, it's 1950s noir, so you know it possesses a certain aura of \"cool\". And while we're on the subject, it's not your typical noir: most noir films feature a dark, violent crime. Violence is absent in this one, but it is replaced with the ruination of reputations. Second, it is very dialogue driven, with some of the best tongue-in-cheek lines you'll ever hear. I felt like I was watching the average episode of Mad Men haha. The camera is quite steady, with dozens of long takes and cool angles to set the mood. I think a big reason I love noir so much is that the characters are so overly mysterious. You can never quite tell what their true intentions are: good, bad, chaotic, neutral, foolish, conniving, or something else entirely. It adds a whole different element to how you watch and dissect the film. The script was impeccably written, using figurative language at every turn. Used today, it usually doesn't work, and movies come off as arrogant and too, idk, self-aware? (Kicking and Screaming comes to mind.) But if a film can make me smile/smirk for its entirety, that is a rare gift. If you're one of those people that doesn't like a \"talking movie\", you need to sit down and reassess your life, cuz this film was out of this world, and never a dull moment.

Has better dialogue ever been written, the meetings between all the different characters that inhabit this world of shadows and intrigue, constantly draw the viewers attention to this masterpiece. When the so called film buffs compile there lists of the \"best\" films and so on, this should always be talked of in the top five and yet though recognised more as the years go by this is still a highly overlooked film. That Marlon Brando, De niro, Nicholson and the like should be recognised so often in said lists when Burt Lancaster in this film and in so many others has equalled or surpassed there best performances is a real scandal. Perhaps because this film strikes at the very heart of the establishment and shows the media and press up for the unscrupulous scum they are that this is one those fellows would like to forget. It is always difficult to look the truth of oneself in the mirror and this is one mirror the media should look very closely at. A masterpiece from Lancaster, who's courage never failed when making films and was always ready to tackle the kind of film making that lesser men would not have dared to, not to mention casting himself in a \"bad guy\" role that defied his heroic, handsome leading man status. Let us not forget that this is the same man who through out his life was never afraid to speak out on subjects that were important to him, a life long liberal and contemptuous of anyone who excepted limitation. I love this film and both Lancaster and the picture were far ahead of their time.This movie, like so many classics of its period, is great to view, in its own right - but doubly so as an historic, nostalgic view of a time past.",

He goes through with it, and does not carry about who's lives he destroys along the way. Sweet Smell of Success is memorable in every way. The acting is purely unbelievable-- every single person in the cast is so well chosen, it's hard to imagine them in any other role. Curtis is fine in his first bad guy role (he was known for being good guys), and deserved the BAFTA nomination. Lancaster is one of the best villainous characters, and to think he didn't receive a nomination for his acting in any award is extremely shocking, it's one of the best performances I've ever seen. Even unknown Susan Harrison is amazing in her first role-- her character goes down a downward spiral, and she does an amazing job. The cinematography is so ahead of it's time, and the clear black-and-white made this film look fresh and new even now.

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review is super long because I wrote it for a class.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one thing that all men want; one thing that grips the desires of the soul and never lets go. This one thing can sink a man to his lowest depths to achieve it: success. The Sweet Smell of Success shows just how low a man will go and how good a movie about it can be.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Smell of Success is the story of New York press agent Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis). Sidney is as crafty as he is charming. He woos potential clients and women alike and at first it seems that he might genuinely care for them. But it soon becomes apparent that Sidney only uses people as stepping stones on his way to the top. If they lose their purpose, they lose their time with Sidney. Sidney isn't that high on the ladder though, but he knows who is. J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) is New York's most popular columnist and the more he mentions Sidney's clients, the better off Sidney is. J.J. understands that Sidney needs him and he knows Sidney will do anything to be on his good side. J.J. orders Sidney to break off his sister Susan's (Susan Harrison) relationship with her musician boyfriend Steve Dallas (Martin Millner). Sidney, blinded by his own ambition and his trust in J.J., is forced to do everything he can to end their engagement.\r\n\r\nI have always pictured older films as being very light-hearted affairs. They didn't deal with hard topics because it was too taboo to show difficult topics on the big screen. The Sweet Smell of Success shattered that na\u00efve assumption. The first time the audience learns that Sidney Falco is nothing but a scumbag is when he uses a trusting girlfriend as a prostitute. The whole film is imbued with the seedier side of show business, one involving blackmail, police brutality and a vaguely incestuous relationship between J.J. and his sister.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Smell of Success succeeds because of two important things. Firstly, the two main characters bring their A-game to the table. Tony Curtis is wonderful as Falco. This is considered his first dramatic role and Curtis brings it to life. Falco is cruel and handsome, full of guile while still leading the audience into thinking he is a good guy. Burt Lancaster is the perfect foil for Tony Curtis. Lancaster shows us the creepy dominance of J.J. Hunsecker: a man who seems to be perpetually in the dark. His tall presence controls every scene and he somehow always has a response to every quick comment out of Tony Curtis' mouth. Burt Lancaster is a fantastic villain, one the audience loves to hate. The Sweet Smell of Success is a testament to his substantial acting ability and he has been recognized as 19th in the Greatest Male Stars of all Time list.\r\n\r\nThe second thing that helps this movie succeed is its setting. New York feels alive under James Wong Howe's cinematic direction. The city is a character itself, lending its atmosphere to the mood of the movie. No scene would be as powerful without the city as a backdrop. The score as well is phenomenal. Jazzy riffs play in almost every scene, sounding like the natural noise of the city. Any score that creates atmosphere without drowning the audience is a thing to be praised.\r\n\r\nI only have one complaint. Some of the dialogue is a little taut and scripted. Natural flow between actors gets interrupted by lines that only Shakespeare could make up on the spot. For a movie as convincingly wonderful as Success, the very smart dialogue should make it even better, not worse.\r\n\r\nIn 1957, America was introduced to Hill-Hecht-Lancaster Production's latest movie The Sweet Smell of Success. Unfortunately, America didn't appreciate it at first, but saner heads prevailed and Success has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity over the years. It became so popular that it was inducted by the National Film Registry into the Library of Congress. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie and any student of film should put it on their must-watch list. The Sweet Smell of Success is an amazing combination of acting and atmosphere that hasn't lost a thing over the years.\r\n\r\n3 and a 1/2 out of 4 stars \r\n  \r\n-Christopher O'Connell",

While these bouts with their complicated twists and turns are initially highly entertaining, the film wore me down with its unrelenting portrayal of human nastiness. The two decent people in the film (the stereotypical repressed lovers) aren't really strong enough to make me care whether or not they got screwed over or not. Still, even with the negatives The Sweet Smell of Success does prove to be intellectually engaging is generally well-composed. I would hesitate to call it an enduring classic--though other people seem to think so--however, it is a good movie even if it is rather emotionally tiring.",

Burt Lancaster plays one of the great evil villains in cinema history, but Tony Curtis is miscast.  He's too pretty, and should have been someone we could root for.  Instead, he's as sleazy and despicable as J.J. Hunsecker.\n\nFor a perspective of 1950's New York nightlife, and for a lesson in film directing and cinematography, it's a can't miss, but if you want to get lost in the story, well, be prepared to approach it knowing that everyone is evil.",

It's a film that brings a new meaning to witty screenplay. Every line could be used as a quote because every line is expertly crafted with amazing direction. The script is largely what saves the plot from being just a melodrama. Because at face value that is what the story is, but if you look past that you see it is a film about morals and respect for your profession, and toys with the idea of \"How far is too far?\" when professional and personal lives overlap.

Both lead by the \"theology of making a fast buck\" these two men use the careers of quality men as stepping stones in order to gain ground. Lancaster is fantastic as he always is and Curtis succeeds in portraying a morally fickle man caught in the grips of greed. Yet, where the film falls flat for me is the lack of presence by Mackendrick. While I do admire directors who are more austere when it comes to making a film, I still want to feel their presence. There was nothing in this film that made me want to really seek out Mackendrick's other work because it seemed as though anybody could have directed the film. Maybe he trusted the acting and story so much that he felt he could just roll without putting too much focus on the style. I don't really know. In the end, It is a bleak and well acted film about the suspension of morality in pursuit of personal gain",

Perhaps paradoxically, the incredible stark black and white night scenes reminded me of nothing less than Michael Mann's recent exploration of nightscapes in glorious color and depth on the digital front.  To have this happen with a 1957 film, that is obviously drained of color and meant to be as gritty as possible, is a testament to the brilliance of the photography, restoration, and transfer.  It makes me wonder what other night time gems are out there, but simply haven't gotten the Criterion treatment.  The story has never been more relevant as well, although happily I feel that I rarely come into contact with this world.  I certainly know that the non-stop 24/7/365 gossip train exists though, and that it is picking up steam.  These characters are larger than life, especially that of Lancaster and Curtis.  The dialogue is icier and sharper than but few other films and the morals harsher and bleaker.  It seems incredible that the film ever got made, but so much of it is implied and unsaid that it just squeaks by under the radar.  Scripts like this would never have been written without the production Code, which is one of the reasons one can make an argument for it being responsible for the creation of more cinematic masterpieces than it ever prevented from coming to the screen.  This is a Manhattan I've never really known, and I've not seen portrayed comparably in too many films, but I certainly wish I would have had the chance.  It seems just about as cut throat as it gets, at least in civilized society.",

They're just human enough to be believable though, that there are people out there like this.  We are scared and disgusted at the same time.  The writing here is beyond brilliant.  So many good one-liners, but it is also razor sharp and so taut it fries your nerves a little.  \nAdded to that is the atmospheric jazzy-tinged score that embellishes a lot of the time to fit the mood.  But, it's perfect in that sense because everything is a heightened, exaggerated and the music is a part of that.  The lighting is great here, too, lots of harsh lighting and dark shadows only intensify the story we have going on.

You're a cookie full of arsenic.\"\n\nTerrific performances from Burt Lancaster as a ruthless, powerful New York newspaper columnist named J.J. Hunsecker and Tony Curtis as a sleazy PR man named Sidney Falco who'd sell his grandmother if it would benefit him and his clients. Hunsecker is set against his sister marrying a jazz musician and Falco desperately trying to get in favor of Hunsecker, goes along to try and break up the relationship by making claims that the musician is a marijuana user.\n\n\"I'm tasting my favorite new perfume - success!\"\n\nWritten by Ernest Lehman and directed by Alexander MacKendrick, Sweet Smell Of Success is a sharp-edged cookie full of arsenic loosely based on real life newspaper man Walter Winchell. Lehman injects plenty of cynicism into the script that could be compared to anything Billy Wilder ever wrote. There isn't a likable character in the film (except for maybe Hunsecker's poor sister and her boyfriend), everyone of them are despicable. MacKendrick's tight direction is on full display as he directs both Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis to one of the best performances each had ever gave in their entire careers. Lancaster puts away his usual likable charm and plays one of his darker roles as the malevolent columnist Hunsecker and Curtis, then an actor mostly known for his looks and not his talent, shows the naysayers that he could really act here in his first real serious role as the weaselly press agent who would do anything just to have the chance of smelling that sweet smell that is success. James Wong Howe's monochrome photography is absolutely breathtaking as it, along with Elmer Bernstein's jazz score, set a dark atmospheric mood following the characters through theaters, hotels and nightclubs. It is some part the equal to Billy Wilder's \"Sunset Boulevard\" yet with it's satirical view of the media and it's box-office turn out, it can be compared more to Wilder's followup to \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Ace In the Hole\".\n\n\"What does that mean - integrity?\"\n\nBritish filmmaker Alexander MacKendrick creates one of the greatest films of the '50s, possibly ever made. It is an absolute classic of the noir genre that has aged gracefully. This is a film for fans of classic movies. Absolutely essential viewing. 10/10\n\n\"I love this dirty town.\"",

Hunsecker, brilliantly played by Burt Lancaster in one of his finest performances and his unscrupulous press agent Sidney Falco, masterfully played by Tony Curtis in a performance that showed him to be a first-rate actor and just not another handsome Hollywood face, his slick, opportunistic Sidney Falco who would do anything to curry favor with Hunsecker, it is a memorable characterization by Curtis that is the backbone of this gripping drama of big-city corruption. Another standout performance is by Susan Harrison who superbly plays Hunsecker's tormented teenaged sister Susan, whom he harbors incestuous feelings for, a bristling and compelling screenplay by Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman from the novelette by Ernest Lehman that has vivid and hard-boiled dialogue with lines like, \"i'd hate to take a bite out of you,\" Hunsecker tells Tony Curtis's poisonous press agent Sidney Falco, \"you're a cookie filled with arsenic. Soulful supporting performances by Martin Milner, Sam Levene, Barbara Nichols, Jeff Donnell, Joseph Leon and Edith Atwaier, taut direction by Alexander Mackendrick and a superb jazz score by Elmer Bernstein, exquisite black & white cinematography by James Wong Howe that perfectly captures the New York City nightlife of the late 1950s.This film has been selected for preservation by the National Film Registry and the American Film Institute has selected Burt Lancaster's character  J.J. Hunsecker as No.35, on its list of the top 50 villains in cinematic history. Highly Recommended.",

That is to say, the characters talk in hard-edged, mean-spirited quips, and the movie is extremely cynical and dark. In fact, I doubt I've seen anything else from the 1950s that has such plainly sordid, nasty goings-on. Apparently, the main character is based on the infamous gossip columnist Walter Winchell. The story concerns an influential and unscrupulous columnist, his relationship with his equally amoral lapdog, and the way the two of them mess with several other blameless people's lives. Bruce Lancaster, who usually played heroes, is very good as the columnist, who has oddly memorable glasses. Tony Curtis is also really excellent and energetic as the desperate little lackey.

Furthermore, it also casts Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster, who were both known previously for playing heroes, as the villains of the show. Tony Curtis is Sidney Falco, a slimey PR agent who will go to any lengths to get publicity from J.J. Hunsecker (Lancaster), the most powering newspaper columnist in New York. Hunsecker doesn't want his sister marrying a Jazz musician, and so orders Falco to break up their love affair by any means necessary. Curtis is totally convicing as the greasy slimeball press agent, who totally deserves all the bad luck he has coming his way. Indeed, Curtis's fans were initially horrified, since they were expecting him to play another nice guy role. Lancaster's possibly incestuous feelings towards his sister are never overtly stated but are implied, and whenever on screen he is a force to be reckoned with. Possibly because of such a negative reaction from the fans, Sweet Smell of Success failed at the box office, despite high critical praise. Although not as influential as other film noir like The Naked City, this film is nonetheless an important milestone, with some great dialogue to boot.",

Hunsecker (Lancaster). Alexander Mackendrick keeps the film moving at an swift pace from one scene to the next, and even though it is remembered for its extraordinarily quotable dialog (courtesy of Ernest Lehman and Clifford Odets), the film features spectacular nocturnal visuals of Manhattan, photographed by James Wong Howe. Howe captures the noir atmospherics so well that the shadows in the streets appear to be darker than the night sky, which appears as a kind of dark gray, illuminated by the lights of New York. Lancaster gives arguably the best performance of his career, imbuing Hunsecker with a strong sense of menace, and a stare that cuts through his victims like a knife. \nThe plot has Falco trying to keep an eye on Hunsecker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s younger sister, Susan (Harrison), who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in love with a clean-cut young jazz musician, Steve (Milner), that Hunsecker disapproves of with a vengeance. Falco will do anything to curry the favor of Hunsecker, in order to get his clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 names mentioned in his column and become the big-shot press agent he dreams of being. He sells his soul in the process, and is finally betrayed in the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disturbing and unexpected conclusion.\nMuch of the film consists of Hunsecker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind games in trying to trap Steve into some situation where he can break him and tear him apart; indeed, this sums up pretty much all of Hunsecker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interactions with the characters in the film. Emile Meyer is perfect as the slimy police officer who will plant evidence or drop charges on a whim at Hunsecker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s command. The Chico Hamilton Quinet appears as themselves, providing the intense jazz score that drives the film (along with the memorable orchestral score by Elmer Bernstein).",

Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster). Falco is on the outs with Hunsecker because he hasn't successfully broken up the romance between Hunsecker's sister, Susie (Susan Harrison), and straitlaced jazz guitarist Steve Dallas (Martin Milner). The all-powerful Hunsecker is punishing Falco's failure by not printing any of the publicist's items. Desperate to make a living, Falco reveals a dirty plan to separate weak-willed Susie from her beau. While disgusted by Falco's slimy trade, the threatening, malicious columnist is determined to keep Susie for himself, so he agrees. In this jazzily scored, seamy nocturnal world, everyone is expendable as Hunsecker pushes for his twisted desires and Falco grasps for success. With their machine-gun dialogue and despicable behavior, Hunsecker and Falco are as dangerous as gangsters. The person who comes out on top when the sun rises, however, is a true surprise.",

'the cat's in a bag and the bag's in the river.' the characters play incredible, cool-headed mind games with each other through a maze of brilliant dialogue. this film is the pinnacle of noir smart-talk high style. it seems to embody everything that mamet built his style around. i wish i could see this cast perform 'glengarry glen ross.' it's dark and cynical, but relishes the tone, so it's not as bleak as the period's -other- dark, cynical newspaperman movie, billy wilder's 'ace in the hole'",

Its a deeply cynical outlook from start to finish, and little or nothing has changed in the industry to prove it otherwise. Tony Curtis is the stand out performer here, although Lancaster is imposing as the megalomaniac J.J. Hunsecker.",

Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) holds considerable sway over public opinion with his Broadway column, but one thing that he can't control is his younger sister, Susan (Susan Harrison), who is in a relationship with aspiring jazz guitarist Steve Dallas (Marty Milner). Hunsecker strongly disproves of the romance and recruits publicist Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) to find a way to split the couple, no matter how ruthless the method.",
