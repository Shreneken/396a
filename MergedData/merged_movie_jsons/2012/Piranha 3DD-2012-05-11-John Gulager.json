            "content": "Lake Victory is a dead place after the tragic events with the invasion of prehistoric flesh-eaters piranhas. In Cross Lake, Merkin County, the greedy Chet (David Koechner) opens The Big Wet Water Park against the will of his stepdaughter Maddy (Danielle Panabaker). When the van of her friends Travis (Paul James Jordan) and Ashley (Meagan Tandy) is found in the water and the couple is missing, Maddy and her friend Shelby (Katrina Bowden) miss them and they talk on a wooden deck on the lake; out of the blue, they are attacked by piranhas. Maddy visits the specialist in piranhas Mr. Carl Goodman (Christopher Lloyd) with her former school friend Barry (Matt Bush), who works at The Big Wet, and with her former boyfriend, Deputy Kyle (Chris Zylka), and they discover piranhas in the lake. However Chet refuses to shutdown his water park and soon his costumers are under the attack of the fearful piranhas.I saw \"Piranha 3DD\" on DVD and I found it a gross and funny B-Movie, with stupid but hilarious characters. The director knows the B-movie formula, with teats and beautiful girls. Christopher Lloyd has become stereotyped as the mad scientist in American comedies in the end of his career. The uncredited Ving Rhames afraid of the water and shooting with his leg is comical. But David Hasselhoff steals the movie making fun of himself as the most famous lifeguard of all times. If you shutdown your brain, you will certainly enjoy this movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): \"Piranha 2\" (\"Piranha 2\")",

            "content": "Piranha 3DD is set a year after the horrible events at lake Victoria where a once believed extinct species of Piranha ate lots of people, money grabbing businessman Chet (David Koechner) runs the Big Wet water-park with his stepdaughter Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) who both have differing opinions on how the park should be run. Meanwhile in an underground lake nearby yet more ferocious Piranha hatch & make their way in the local water system killing & eating anyone that wanders into the water. With the grand summer opening of Big Wet the park is going to be packed full of people looking to have a good time but the killer Piranha manage to feast on them after being sucked into the park through water pipes. The Piranha seem unstoppable as they tear their victims apart...Directed by John Gulager, the son of veteran actor Clu Gulager who has a small role in this, I am sure the average person on the street will probably hate Piranha 3DD with it's stupidity, moronic character's, over the top gore, in jokes, film references & downright silliness but I have to say I really liked it & I am 100% serious when I make that statement. Every one of the 80 odd minutes that Pirahna 3DD lasts for is either gory, funny or downright stupid & there's never a dull moment if nothing else. It takes a special kind of person to appreciate a film like Piranha 3DD, I am that kind of person as I found the constant in jokes & references absolutely hilarious, seriously I just found this so funny & during the moments that were supposed to be funny as well. Any scene with David Hasselhoff is just brilliant, he makes fun of himself & his public image seemingly in good humour from a hotel room encounter with two gorgeous twenty something girls to his droll reaction to the carnage at the water-park as he states the obvious when he says 'once these moron's get out of the water the fish are hardly likely to follow them home' to a really funny send up of the Baywatch opening credits just after the closing credits here as a curious little bonus. In fact the film itself lasts for a mere 70 minutes yet the end credits last for 12 minutes with lots of outtakes including what looks like a couple of deleted scenes (the female life guard being strangled on her own whistle cord) & messing around by the cast & crew. The whole film is just so much fun to watch, from the first moments with the farting cow corpse to the scene in which Josh runs around with a Piranha clamped to the end of his penis before castrating himself to the young kid who gets his head bitten off at the very end. The more I think about Piranha 3DD the more I like it. There's plenty of gore although maybe not quite as much as the first & there's plenty of flesh on show with nude swimming pools & lots of horny teens wanting sex. Call me easily pleased but I laughed at the right places, I got just about all the in jokes & film references & enjoyed the film as a whole too as it has a reasonable if not exactly brilliant story, in fact the story is basically the same as the original Piranha (2010) but set in a water-park rather than a big lake & it's considerably more funny.The special effects are alright, the CGI Piranha look okay but not much else & I can't believe they roar like Lions. Whose decision was that exactly? It's the aspect of Piranha 3DD that I thought ended up really lame. There's some gore here, there's plenty of blood & chewed up bodies, there's another severed penis as in the original & to go with all the blood there's lots of nudity on show. Blood & boobs, what more do you want? There's nothing particularly scary here, there's not much build-up of tension & you can guess what's going to happen but it's still great fun. There are lots of bad taste humour & tastelessness going on, a guy with a flapping Piranha stuck up his bum & the priceless line of dialogue where a woman says 'Josh cut of his penis because something came out of my vagina' which is surely one of the greatest lines ever spoken in a motion picture. Enough said. No-involved in the making of Piranha 3DD is taking it seriously so I suggest that anyone watching it doesn't either & just take it for what it is.The IMDb says that Piranha 3DD had a budget of about $20,000,000 which it total rubbish, try about half that. Since I am blind in one eye I cannot watch films in 3D so I have no idea how effective it is here. Filmed in Wilmington in North Carolina. The cameos from Christopher Lloyd & Ving Rhames reprising their roles from the original are also pretty funny, especially Rhames & his gun legs which he borough by saving money from 'not buying any socks'! Gary Busey also has a small cameo at the start. The rest of the cast are OK, they were obviously chosen for their looks rather than their acting skills.Piranha 3DD is a film that the majority of people will hate & despise, of that I have no doubt but for those of us who it was actually made for will probably love it. Sure, it constantly tries to appeal to the lowest common denominator with it's nudity, gore, nastiness & outright silly send-ups & gags but there's no harm in that. Is there?",

            "content": "Well this was a huge disappointment! I really liked the first Piranha 3D film so I was looking forward to this. This is a lazy, lifeless, and pointless sequel that had no business being made. Instead of being so bad it's good like the first film, this one is just so bad it's terrible. For starters, the first Piranha film actually had likable characters and somewhat of a plot to it. This one has the thinest of a plot you can get and the characters are incredibly lifeless and not even the main character serves any purpose to the film at all. You'd think that with this being a sequel they would amp up the gore and deaths, but the deaths in this one are actually tamer than the first and there's actually less of them. The film tries to be much more of a comedy this time around by adding more humor which all of it falls flat. The humor in this film is so awful and outdated thats it's hard to believe anyone over the age of 13 actually wrote this film. But, what really annoyed me about this film is just how damn stupid it is! The writers couldn't even come up with a decent way to get these characters in a situation to set up a death scene and instead have them do something really stupid or come up with a really stupid reason to get them in a situation that sets up a lame death. The acting here (even though it's suppose to be bad) is bad even for a B-Movie. And just when you think you will finally get a payoff after sitting through 55 minutes of crap, the film presents you with a lazy and totally underwhelming climax that is filmed so poorly that most of the time you can't even tell what is going on (And this really sucks because that was the highlight of the first film). And then, the film presents us with an ending so stupid and forced that even those who can suspend their disbelief the most will be left frustrated with just how incredibly stupid the ending is. The film is a short (althought it feels much longer) 70 minutes followed by 11 minutes of credits that include a ton of lame outtakes. I can now see why The Weinstein Company decided to only release this in barely any theaters and just put in on VOD. I still can't believe how bad this movie was. The director John Gulager shouldn't ever be allowed to be involved with a film ever again because this guy can't direct to save his life. Alexandre Aja who directed the first film actually understood the material he was working with. John Gulager had no idea what the hell he was doing and just decided the wip out a POS to make a quick buck because he obviously didn't care about this film at all and just wanted to get paid. As far as the cameo's in the film go, Gary Busey is only in the films opening scene and is wasted (the only thing we get to see him do is light a cow's farts on fire). Ving Rhames cameo doesn't just feel forced, but also is just really pathetic and sad to watch. The only positive things I can say about this film was that David Hasselfhoff's scenes are actually chuckle worthy and there's a lot of gorgeous nude women on screen many times. Even though i'm only giving the film 1/2 a star, that feels generous. This film could've really been a blast and fun just like the first one was, but it really is just an atrocity of a film that not even the biggest fans of the first one will enjoy. If you are looking for a fun B-Movie, go rent Piranha 3D and just forget that this film even exist. Piranha 3DD tries to so self-award of itself that it just ends up being exactly what it's parodying.",

I don't understand the combination and would recommend viewers who want to see copious nudity find something better and without the silly piranha plot...either a good porno or a good disaster film.The film is set at a water park where the owner has hired strippers as lifeguards. In addition to seeing various sexy ladies naked, you eventually see insane fish show up and chomp on everyone. 'Nuff said about the plot!The fact that \"Piranha 3DD\" is on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list isn't much of a surprise. After all, it's got '3DD' in the title and is rauchier and sillier than a Porky's film. Add to that cartoonish characters and dopey dialog and you have a film which seems bound to lose a lot of money. In the US, the distributors barely tried to recoup their losses but amazingly the picture did reasonably well overseas.As for me, I'm a bit ashamed I watched it. While I have been working hard to see every one of the Bottom 100, this one is dumber and dirtier than pretty much all the rest.",

I actually didn't mind the movie being short, after all it was always hard to stretch the storyline more than an hour.The whole movie was more like a spoof, and somehow I felt Christopher Lloyd, Ving Rhames and of course The Hoff all added to the fun. The Hoff in particular was great. His role really suited him. He also had a bit more screen time than I would've thought.I didn't see this in 3D, and I'm not sure if that would've changed my rating. There was a fair bit of gratuitous nudity, but I suppose the gratuitous gore balances that out.So if you find gratuitous blood, body parts and boobs (and screaming) hilarious, this movie is worth a look over a beer and popcorn.

            "content": "Piranha 3DD is the first 3D film, or \"3DD\" film in this case, to be released both theatrically and through video on demand. I wouldn't even call this 3D. All you get are creatures, breasts, blood, water, and vomit careening towards the camera amateurishly and in an unnecessary fashion. At least it's in bright colors and not dimmed with a ludicrous surcharge.The film is an affront to the genre of horror-comedy, shielded by the unacceptable and numbing phrase \"leave your brain at the door,\" and atrociously erected off of clich\u00e9s, idiocy, and nude characters. The original Piranha 3D was a surprising summer success, and to be fair, it wasn't horrifically awful. The actors in it knew they were in a goofy, outrageous B-movie ode, and some sequences were well arranged. The problem? The CGI, which killed many of the death scenes, making them look implausible and unrealistic, virtually killed the mood and the idea that this was a low budget, cheesy horror flick.And now, the marginally passable horror flick has a sequel leaching off of it, that pushes the envelope of parody so far that it becomes dreadfully incompetent. It is so indulgent, always trying to be so witty and cute with its puns, references, and spoof-elements that the stench of desperation quickly fogs the screen.Instead of a beach, this time, we are taken to a water-park, ran by the royally perverted and careless step-dad of our main character (Koecher). He is so pre-occupied with prepubescent fantasies that he ignores everyone around him completely. His daughter Maddy (Panabaker), co-owner of the water-park and aspiring marine biologist, is concerned that with the rumor of piranhas swimming through sewers and drain pipes that they may be a hazard to the park. Her step-dad doesn't listen, and it isn't before long that he gets his comeuppance.The remainder of the picture is a mindless shows for the kiddies, containing more breasts than anything I've seen this whole year, sometimes even two or more pairs per frame. The film is so juvenile, crass, and filthy-minded, and the characters so impotent, one-note, and poor that one can not help either drifting away while watching or just simply not caring.There is a degrading, nasty scene in the film I'd like to discuss. It involves a piranha festering around the part of a woman that goes without saying, before it leapfrogs and jumps out onto that part of a man that goes without saying, before he has to cut the whole thing off with scissors. The scene is nothing short of unnecessary and borderline reprehensible.One thing that Piranha 3D had was the star-power its sequel woefully lacks. It had the appearances of great actors like Elizabeth Shue, Jerry O'Connell, Ving Rhames, and Christopher Lloyd, showing despite their well deserved success, could still pull off a campy exercise relatively well. Lloyd makes a cameo in a scene far too short, Rhames does too and earns the only laughs the picture sees, and David Hasselhoff, portraying himself as a lifeguard, shows us why he has fallen off the face of the mainstream world in the first place.Now, maybe I'm being too brazen and unfair. Piranha 3DD is a fairly harmless piece of work, but not a good one at that. Its structure of scantily clad women, many full-frontally nude, phoned-in characters, too little, too late cameos, third rate special effects, and cheap, nonexistent suspense wears so thin so quickly it becomes appalling. I have no problem with horror, even when it creates a hybrid with the neighboring genre of comedy, but this is a work of hybrid indulgence and overkill.NOTE: The film ends the same way Piranha 3D ended, with an abrupt, unsuspecting scene that provides us with one last quick jump and conveniently leaves the franchise open for another sequel. Though with the very secluded release of this sequel, I wouldn't put all my money on \"3DDD\" so quickly.Starring: Danielle Panabaker, Matt Bush, David Koechner, Chris Zylka, Katrina Bowden, Gary Busey, Christopher Lloyd, and David Hasselhoff.

But after we know in which direction this film is taking us - an 'Adults only'-pool with water certified strippers - and the awful acting of several supporting cast members, I knew this wasn't gonna be the good-kinda-bad. Sadly \"Piranha 3DD\" is more boring than its predecessor and could've been more, if you look at the original 'Piranha' sequel (directed by James Cameron himself).

There is an attempt to recapture the gleeful sleazy trashiness of its predecessor, although I felt it tried a bit too hard, and lost some of the innocent sense of fun to be had among the severed penis sequences (and, yes, I am quite aware of how ludicrous that sentence sounds).Making up for everything, though, is a wonderfully funny and self-deprecating performance from David Hasselhoff - the Hoff lampoons his own perceived pomposity mercilessly and with pinpoint accuracy.

Although containing plenty of both intentional and unintentional laughs, \"3DD\" often mistakes simple-minded schlock cinema for parody and balls-out nonsense for organic fun. The Weinstein Company/Dimension Films should strongly consider packing this disc with a six pack of beer combo offer.It's really no surprise that an influx of gratuitous nudity, celebrity cameos (as game and often ironically funny as they often are) and heaps of sheer camp can do little to raise Piranha 3DD to the level of its predecessor. It's even less mysterious as to how populating this film with jerks, ditsy bitches and pure morons (who are seemingly all bipolar judging by their mood, rationalizing and motivations) fail to make for a compelling B-movie. Of course we expect these human-shaped hunks of piranha fodder to make poor decisions for the sake of crimson water, but when it seems like the writers are intentionally trying to craft most of these individuals with the IQ of water-logged bait worms, it comes off more as insulting.A year has passed since the massacre at Lake Victoria, and following an eradication campaign that led to the complete and utter contamination of the water, the town's tourist industry has been likewise extinguished. But to paraphrase Dr. Malcolm from Jurassic Park, \"life finds a way\" and a newly evolved school of prehistoric nasties has managed to elope to another nearby lake, which unlucky for its inhabitants, supplies the local water park called \"The Big Wet.\" Oh and in case you were even going to ask, these piranha have mutated to thrive in chlorinated water or something, so the attack may, in fact, commence without delay. Of the things to enjoy in Piranha 3DD, it's bar none the extended cameos from Ving Rhames (complete with a shotgun leg) and a booze-swilling, out-of-shape David Hasselhoff whose self-lampooning is the only effective instance of parody to be found in this sequel. His reluctant \"celebrity appearance\" at the opening of \"The Big Wet\" amounts to nearly all of the films involuntary chuckles and his bond with a young boy (which forms because he is the only one who doesn't recognize him as the star from Baywatch) is close to the stuff of comedy gold. Aside from those fleeting moments of inspiration, Piranha 3DD is missed opportunity after miscalculated set-piece. I mean, if you've managed to devise a scenario where a fish has managed to enter (and live in) a woman's vagina and then manage to overlook the chance to make an \"eating out\" joke, the filmmakers have failed us all. As far as high camp is concerned, you could certainly find more blas\u00e9 fare, though that doesn't excuse this film from being an unnecessary sequel that seems to think its audience consists of horny preteens who have never seen a proper parody rather than horror buffs looking for a faithful and lovingly crafted follow-up to Piranha 3D.",

            "content": "Wow. Just wow. Let me note that I enjoyed the first Piranha, and went into this movie with an open mind (despite horrible reviews). What a absolutely HORRIBLE sequel. The time around, the directors have obviously run out of ideas. It was a sequel to a movie that didn't need a sequel. You can only get about 1 good movie from a concept as simple as piranhas, and that's all but clear, seeing as this movie sucked. First of all, this movie is disgusting. You see a fat mans bloody ass, the tip of a severed penis, gore galore (and not the good kind...the bad overly bloody fake looking kind), and a piranha that swam up a girls v- a-g. At points you could tell the piranha's were puppets, and the puns were cheesy one liners at best. The whole film made me nauseous, and the deaths of several people were fake as fake can be. A guy gets decapitated from a yellow flag ribbon...yah...that's right...a guy's head gets severed (though the neck bone and all), by a piece of plastic that is soft, stretchy, only about 1 nano-meter thick, and not even sharp. There is also a guy who gets skewered through the eye, because of an explosion that caused a trident to have impeccable aim falling from the sky. Also, one of the main characters has enough aim to skewer a bag of chips and a piranha perfectly from a good 20 feet away, which begs the question of how he is a lifeguard. The whole film makes no sense, with a girl who has a seizure while having sex (due to a piranha inside her)only to come back to life once a guy severs his pen!s, and the kick- butt black man from the first movie has a shot gun leg. And finally, the ending sucked to an extreme. The piranhas have now begun to walk (or really hop), at the end, only to cut off the entire head of a really nice innocent kid, just for a cheesy one liner that wasn't even funny. In short, this movie is complete an utter crap. Avoid watching (unless you like stupid, gross, and fake movies).",

It's not a typical role for what I'm used to seeing her in, but she's does a great job as she's a quality actress.David Koechner leads the humor (and he's good at it) of the movie with some solid help from the rest of the cast. David Hasselhoff, Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames even make cameos.There isn't much to this movie, there's water, fish, and people, and some combination of them to various degrees of humor and horror.",

The makers of this film absolutely had no idea how to turn this into a good and fun genre movie to watch.It should tell you enough already that main cast and crew members of the first movie are no part of this film. I like to believe that they were smart enough to stay away as far as possible from this obvious inferior sequel.From a sequel to a movie like \"Piranha\", you would expect them to go even more overboard with things, this time around. But instead of more gore, more nudity and more fun, there is less of everything. Especially the fact that there isn't really any good gore present is very disappointing. And the gore that is present in the movie is just far too fake looking for my liking. It prefers to use computer effects over practical effects, which was a really poor pick, in my opinion.But what makes the movie just bad to watch is the fact that the story is all over the place. It doesn't really follow a good a clear main plot line and none of the characters is fun or even likable enough to care for.This movie really has some bad and lazy writing in it. This shouldn't always be a problem for a movie of this sort though. I mean, the first \"Piranha\" movie sure had lots of big plot holes in it as well but the fun of the whole movie compensated a lot. It actually was a part of what made the movie so fun to watch. It made it a spoof of the genre, by making fun of all the clich\u00e9s and weaknesses, including lots of nonsensical stuff and big plot holes. So really, deliberate bad written can be fun but I feel that in this case it wasn't deliberate at all. It's just incompetence and that's also what makes it bad and annoying to follow all.When the end comes, you suddenly also start to realize that everything that happened before really didn't mattered and totally wasn't being relevant for the movie at all. You could say that the movie only builds up to its last 30 minutes or so, which isn't even being a good movie finale. It was supposed to be one big bloodbath and orgy or gore but let me tell you that compared to the first movie, this one felt like a kids film.Really, it all could had been saved with some good humor but that is also incredibly lacking in this movie as well. They had no idea how to make things fun and even when the movie is going over-the-top, it just isn't being all that funny to watch.It's just incredibly bad all and not in a good or fun way at all.

Yep, that's about it for the admittedly flimsy plot, but fortunately director John Gulager and screenwriters Patrick Melton, Joel Soisson, and Marcus Dunstan don't take any of this cheery spirited foolishness seriously for a minute; instead they pile on the tasty excessive gratuitous distaff nudity, over-the-top graphic gore, and blithely rude'n'crude humor with a go-for-broke spoofy joy and brio that's both uproarious and entertaining in good measure. The whole gloriously tasteless affair reaches its jaw-dropping sick'n'sidesplitting apex during an outrageous coitus interuptus set piece that's truly something special to behold. The lively cast really sink their teeth into the endearingly crass material: The foxy Danielle Panabaker makes for an appealing and attractive heroine as the spunky Maddy, Matt Bush contributes an engaging turn as the amiable Barry, David Koechner jerks it up nicely as smarmy amusement park owner Chet, Chris Zylka likewise hits it out of the slimy ballpark as hunky, but sleazy and corrupt deputy Kyle, Katrina Bowden brings a cute charm to her part as sweet virgin Shelby, Christopher Lloyd ravenously devours the scenery as flaky fish expert Mr. Goodman, and Ving Rhames has several sidesplitting moments struggling to surmount his hydrophobia as the scared and crippled Deputy Fallon. Best of all, the Almighty Hoffmeister sends up his pumped-up pompous \"Baywatch\" persona something rotten as his own supremely cool and self-deprecating self. Gary Busey and Clu Gulager both get munched early in the action. The outtakes during the end credits are simply priceless. Alexandre Lehmann's slick cinematography provides a pleasing polished look and makes hilariously cheesy use of strenuous slow motion. Elia Cmiral's dynamic score does the rousing dramatic trick.

            "content": "I really enjoyed 2010's remake of \"Piranha.\" It was a rare type that managed to not only work as a stand alone movie, but delivered everything that it promised: boobs, gore, and comedy. It was also well directed, acted, and had a level of wit within the proceedings.Well, the studio decided that it was a movie that warranted a sequel, and decided to hand over the reigns to the guys that brought you \"Feast.\" Well, with it's small (about 75 theaters) theatrical release and On-Demand run, it's easy to see why it's not getting a whole lot as far as promotion is concerned: it's a really s#!tty movie.Taking place one year after the events of the first movie, the movie opens with a cameo from Gary Busey and Clu Gulagar becoming food for Piranhas that come out of a dead but still flatulent cow. Yes, that is the level of humor we are dealing with. Brace yourself, because it gets worse.The next day, Maddy (Daniel Panabaker) is in a bit of a disagreement with her stepfather Chet (David Koechner) because he's turned the family water park (called \"The Big Wet\") into a more adult oriented place with strippers as lifeguards. However, the piranha's are back, and headed to the pool via the pipe system. Her friends Barry (Matt Bush) and Kyle (Chris Zykla) must now try to do something to stop the upcoming onslaught-and you can guess how that goes. Meanwhile, Shelby (Katrina Bowden) is ready to lose her virginity, but a baby piranha goes up her...um, lady parts. Also, Ving Rhames, Paul Sheer and Christpher Lloyd return, and David Hasselhoff shows up as himself.The best word I can think of describing \"Piranha 3DD\" (ha ha) would be \"lazy.\" The direction by John Gulagar ranges from pedestrian to just plain bad, with murky underwater shots, poor editing and no clue how to direct moments of violence or any of the actors. Here, you have people who have proved themselves to be good to decent actors delivering awful performances, with some (in particular Rhames) seeming to be embarrassed to be there. In their defense, they are working with a script that feels like it was written by 8th graders. This is a movie where people do things that are dumb even by the standards of horror movies, and characters change motivations (Kyle goes from being an alright guy to a total asshole just completely out of the blue) without any attention to consistency.So, does the humor work? Well, as you can tell from the third paragraph, no. There's one moment that's funny, but most of the movie plays out like something you'd get from a really bad comedy (stuff like \"Fired Up!\") with gore and female nudity. This is movie that thinks a piranha going up a fat man's ass is great comedy. How about the gore? It's pretty tame compared to the last movie, with the inevitable water park massacre feeling anemic in comparison to the all out slaughter fest of the last movie. Sure, there's decapitations and blood in the water, but it's nothing you haven't seen a billion times before.Now I know, I know. \"It's supposed to be dumb!\" you might be saying. Hell, I enjoy dumb entertainment as much as the next guy. This however, is the bad kind of dumb entertainment. The kind that makes no effort whatsoever, and expects you to go along with it because hey man, tits and ass and gore! I'm sorry, but it takes more than that to make a good trashy movie. This is the kind of thing that gives trash a bad name. Being dumb is no excuse for being lazy.It's really no surprise as to why this didn't get a wide theatrical release and has gotten next to no promotion-it f#@%ing sucks. Everything about this feels like a really bad direct-to-video sequel, and that the studio had no idea what to do with it. This is a movie that's best left avoided. Just watch the previous one, or the original.",

This follow-up to the 2010 movie is just honestly embarrassing. It had all the elements that the first movie had, but everything goes horribly wrong with incompetent direction, laughably bad acting and dialogue, and some of the cheapest gore effects I've ever seen.Why is this movie so bad? Let's start with the plot - there is none. If you can buy the premise that piranhas are going to go in underground lakes and somehow end up in a water park swimming, well then I have a bridge to sell you as well. The characters are all terrible. The one couple in the van early on exists only to die, no other purpose, no even attempted development. Yet later we see other characters mourning their disappearance, only it's forgotten 5 minutes later. The one scene that people will probably remember involves a girl that had a piranha swim up her lady parts (and somehow survive) only to bite her boyfriend's penis during intercourse. Trying to be inventive there, but really just shows the lack of any restraint with this movie. But even if you think the plot and acting are atrocious, at least there will be good gore, right? Wrong. The gore effects can be described in one word: cheap. The special effects with the piranhas are terrible too - you wonder where they spent $20 million on this movie. Not to mention, the inevitable massacre scene is shot so poorly that it has zero coherence and lacks any punch. It looks like they just poured some red dye in the pool and hired a few extras to flop around. The massacre scene in the first film had some of the best gore effects I'd ever seen. This is a joke of a follow-up.So which actors disgraced themselves for a paycheck? There is a cameo by David Hasselhoff where he's basically mocking himself, but you have to wonder what is going through his head when his character mutters \"Welcome to rock bottom.\" I wonder if the irony is lost on this man. David Koechner is just obnoxious and terrible. Jerry O'Connell played this type of character way better in the first film. Every time Koechner was on screen, I was just wanting him to get killed off already.And also surprisingly, we don't even get any good nudity. All the extras they hired for this movie look like washed up strippers. None of the cute female leads goes topless. Maybe they ran out of budget and couldn't pay them enough to do it.I have a feeling that 95% of the people involved in this film will ever have meaningful work in Hollywood again (thankfully).

The narrative drive is held up by self congratulatory mis-en-scene BLAH BLAH BLAH . The camera angles are of an unnatural nature BLAH BLAH BLAH \" and my fears were confirmed by the opening pre-title sequence as we're shown long lingering shots that merely exist to show the audience this is a film in 3-D but after this I saw something totally unexpected - a film so bad it made me forget I was watching something with a gimmick and made me think I was watching something produced by either Mad Mullah Omar or Fred Phelps From the outset we're watching a film that has an entirely ethnocentric world view of America . People of the United states are very young , impossibly good looking and incredibly stupid . The only people who aren't are very old , very ugly and very stupid and everyone has a sex drive higher than Mount Everest . This is acceptable if you're good looking and female and totally disgusting if you're notWe're introduced to heroine Maddy and villain Chet her stepfather . We know Maddy is the heroine because her breasts can't be bigger than 34B and are natural unlike 99% of the women featured . One wonders how the other women can swim since their obviously enhanced boobs make it aerodynamically impossible . We know instantly Chet is the villain because he own's 51% of the water-park to Maddy's 49%. That and the fact Chet comes across as so creepy you just want to look him up on the Megan's Law website And that's the thing about PIRANHA 3-DD . The humour relies on innuendo but it's not the type of naughty but nice innuendo you see in the likes of THE BENNY HILL SHOW but this lazy near the knuckle humour along the lines of \" Are you still wet \" that wasn't funny to begin with and continues for most of the film , so much so you find yourself very tempted to switch off What saves the film from being a total disaster is that the final third works very well when we're introduced to David Hasselhoff playing ..... David Hssselhoffa sort of hetrosexual Liberace . The set-piece of the piranha attacking the swimmers at the water-park are very entertaining in a tasteless way . One thing I remember about the Joe Dante original is the lack of internal logic where people wade through the water for no other reason than to be eaten . This is referenced by a woman asking for the Hoff to help and his replying that \" They've only got themselves to blame by staying in the water . What'd expect the fish to do ? Follow them home \" which had me laughing out-loud while wondering why this type of post modernist wit wasn't employed earlier ? In short this is a very uneven film . It's trash as so many people have said but some of it is slightly witty , or rather slightly witty in comparison with much of the other humour employed . Being a 3-D movie many scenes merely exist to show the audience that it's a 3-D movie whilst some scenes exist merely to show that America has a monopoly on bikini babes with silicon breasts. Most teenage boys will enjoy it while Jihadists will think it's a gritty documentary about infidels in small town America",

Basically it has been one year since the events at Lake Victoria, which has become a deserted and restricted area, dried up and deserted due to no tourism after the infestation of prehistoric piranha fish. But this threat is to return when in a nearby lake farmer Clayton (Gary Busey) and his friend are in the water to recover a dead cow, and below them are many more of the fish eggs that hatch, and they attack and kill the two men. Not far away, the Big Wet water park is making preparations to open to the public for the summer, and marine biology student Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), who co-owns the park, doesn't approve of her step-father Chet (David Koechner) adding an adult-themed section and hiring strippers. She also reacquaints herself with old friends, like policeman ex-boyfriend Kyle (Chris Zylka), friend Barry (Matt Bush) who has had a secret crush on her for ages, and close friends Ashley Fallon (Meagan Tandy) and Shelby (Katrina Bowden). One night Shelby and her boyfriend Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) go skinny dipping in the lake, and a baby piranha swims up into her vagina, and at the same time Ashley and her boyfriend Travis (Paul James Jordan) are having sex in their van when the handbrake is tripped and they go into the lake to be devoured by the fish. The next day Maddy consoles Shelby on the jetty, and it is there that piranhas attack them, but they get out of it and manage to have one of the fish swim on the shore to kill it. The two of them and Barry go to see Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd) to examine the fish, and he gives them the explanation that the fish are moving via sewage pipes and underground in the unseen lakes below, they conclude that the drains the fish may use go from the lake and lead into the new water park. While something is to be done, Shelby and Josh have sex, and the piranha in her vagina comes out to bite his penis, so he chops it off with a knife, and they both go to hospital. Maddy finds out that Kyle is not all that good as well, he has been accepting bribes that allow Chet to drain water for the water park from the lake, with the vast amount coming from the underground lakes. Big Wet opens to the public, with Baywatch star David Hasselhoff appearing as a celebrity lifeguard, and also arriving is Lake Victoria survivor Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames), who lost his legs, and former cameraman Andrew 'Drew' Cunningham (Paul Scheer) who pushes his wheelchair. Maddy tries to shut the park down, but Chet and Kyle stop her doing anything as they do not believe there will be any piranhas, but of course soon enough the fish come along and attack all the guests and lifeguards. Fallon has a shotgun attached to his legs and shoot many of the blood thirsty monsters, and Hasslehoff feels happy that he rescued a little boy - his first rescue in real life, and in the chaos, Chet makes a run with the money he made, before having his head sliced off by a cable. Barry starts to drain the pool to stop the fish getting in and the water flowing to dry the place out, but in the pool Maddy gets pulled down by suction, Kyle refuses to save her, so Barry, who can't swim, leaps in and saves her. Another employee at the same pours gasoline into the pipe system, and with a lit cigarette put in as well an explosion causes most of the piranhas to be blown up, and Kyle is impaled by a falling trident. As Massy and Barry kiss and feel relieved it is over, Mr. Goodman calls them and informs them that the fish are evolving, as his in the tank has grown legs and run away, and soon enough one piranha crawls out the water to attack the boy Hasselhoff rescued. Panabaker is rather dull, Lloyd is still relatively amusing, and Hasselhoff badly spoofs himself, and director John Gulager badly paces the action when it is supposed to be exciting, there are so many problems with this follow up to a hit movie. The story needed a lot of work, the acting is daft, the gore was less grisly and did not appear often enough, the penis munching and cutting sequence is just disgusting, the special effects are wasted, and no big boobs bouncing and flashing can save it, it is a terrible horror comedy sequel.

There's something very calming about being able to sit back and drive oneself into a movie with absolutely no worries about themes, agendas, politico posturing and etc. What shouldn't be tolerated is when film makers ask you to not only leave your brain at the door, but to also dribble with it and slam dunk it into the nearest garbage can.Alexandre Aja's 2010 redux of Piranha was a whole bunch of fun, even away from the 3D, in 2D form it had a devilish glint in its eye, but this on the other hand is an embarrassment to all involved. Who doesn't love the female form? Whatever your sexual proclivities et al, you would have to be dead to not appreciate the splendour of Eve's offspring. But when it's your main selling point, when you are only trying to please a very small movie watching demographic, then you got problems.John Gulager (director in the broadest context of the word) wants to craft a Porky's for this latest hairy palmed generation, whilst he even thinks a touch of Grindhouse might curry favour with the mall rats and skaters. Everything about this picture stinks, the acting, the hopeless attempts at suspense, badly timed jokes, poor stereotyping, laughable effects work, and on it goes. Standing up and saying it's meant to be tacky, corny and tongue in cheek just doesn't cut the mustard here, bad film making is just that, especially when it's done purely to make money.Right, I'm off to dive into a tank full of piranha fish, because that will surely be better than having to ever sit through this movie again. 1/10",

After the dreadful event in Lake Victoria , the blood-thirsty fishes are back into the game when they make their way into the newly opened water theme park - BIG WET. Now , not sure what the director John Gulager was thinking when he made this terrible film. The film is more of porn-sleazy time pass rather than visual appealing 3D entertainer. From top-less women to penis- attack scene, the movie is a complete shame and gives you an yuckee feeling. Worst is not over yet , there is scene where owner's head bounces of in the air which is ultimately caught by topless female who in panic rubs the head against her breast. All these scenes , coupled by way-to-below performances gives a headache and you will surely be out of the theater as soon as you realize that you made the mistake of your life by buying the tickets for this worthless movie. There is nothing called screenplay in the film , the cinematography has been effectively used to take close and angle shots of the naked women. Background score is horrible. Performances wise , it is Ving Rhames who does justice in small role. Danielle Panabaker does shine in the role of Maddy. The CGI gives a sense of feelings as if you are watching some 1980's low-budget slasher film. Overall , I wasted my time watching the good-for-nothing sleazy, skin- show which was more about cleavages rather than good entertainment film. Very Bad 0.5 / 5",

Odd then that my girlfriend and I -- who do not often share a taste in films -- both enjoyed it.Yes, the film has no plot, terrible CGI, and wastes good talent like Christopher Lloyd and Gary Busey. Yes, it seems like nothing more than an excuse to get women naked (and I have to say the nudity got a bit excessive for my liking). But the whole idea here was to have fun, and that is what the writers (and director) did.But, it was also a shining moment in Ving Rhames' career, possibly the funniest character he may ever have. And it was the greatest love letter to David Hasselhoff that will ever be written. The man will never again be taken seriously, and this takes the self-deprecation humor to a whole new level.

I have to admit not much more.This is a sequel made on an obviously smaller budget, which is not actually a bad thingThe film is nice to look at, it has that sunshine bubblegum look that throws back to 1980s comedies. There are less locations and sets used. The support cast/naked women I suspect were deliberately employed because they were ropey looking and were probably past their prime strippers. The story itself is secondary and so it should be, the viewer wants one thing only hungry piranhas, OK two the male viewer also wants female boobs. In the first 30 minutes it is a boob fest, but once David Hasslehoff appears the boobs end, and are replaced by moobs (excellent use of slow motion).In the UK Mr Hasselhoff is a living joke and represents all that is down market about the US. The use of Mr Hasslehoff is one of the films revelations as he plays along with the script and just rips his entire persona to pieces, if he wins a golden raspberry or even gets nominated he should accept it with pride. Gary Busey opening cameo meant nothing to me, I think it was a gag that only Americans will understand. The director gives his father a nice cameo as well. Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames rip their scenes to pieces BUT do come out of the film with their dignity intact. This film probably explains why Rhames was not available for Mission Impossible 4. Who wants Cruise when they can have a scene blasting piranhas out of the water.The lead actors were very bland and nondescript and this helped the viewer root for the annihilation of the cast. Some of the gore is good and inventive.I don't think this film will clean up at the box office, but I think it will have a long after life on home media. The use of 3D does get wearisome after a while and found myself taking the glasses for long stretches of the action. Luckily some of it played OK in this situation",

The original story has Richard Dreyfus getting killed in the first scene. In this production we are happy to see it is Gary Busey. In the original feature, porn stars provided most of the topless scenes. In this one they opt to use main stream women. Perhaps the first feature should be called 3DD and this one 3D.This story takes place in Arizona where Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) is dismayed that her stepfather (David Koechner) has changed the water park into an adult water park with topless \"certified\" strippers acting as lifeguards. Meanwhile the late Gary Busey has released the hideous piranha into the town's lake. So how do we get piranha from the lake into the swimming pools? Christopher Lloyd gives us clues.The movie is a teen sex romp. It has lines which are an adolescent's dream, such as \"Let's take off all our clothes and go swimming\" and a few I can't repeat. The van scene was interesting if not sacrilegious. There is an intense lake scene with our heroine and one of the weirdest sex scenes since \"Teeth.\" Up to this point I was thinking how much I liked what they did, with some new bits. Then at the climax scene, they made it ridiculous, especially the part with David Koechner.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, full frontal nudity, nudity (Irina Voronina, Cody Kennedy, plus many others)",

When I then watched the two inferior sequels my enthusiasm got tempered quite a bit already, and after seeing \"Piranha 3DD\" I'm entirely convinced that he's just another stereotypical dumb and low-keyed director who abuses the genre in order to serve idiotic plots, horrible computerized gore effects and infantile gratuitous nudity\u0085 \"Piranha 3DD\" features everything that gives horror \u2013 as well as sequels in general \u2013 a bad reputation. It is clearly put together too hastily, meaning that the production got green-lighted before there even was a plot in order to cash in on the success of Alexandre Aja original/remake, and strictly aimed at audiences who presume that horror is all about big-breasted bikini girls and ridiculously oversized creatures designed with computer programs. My God, I just feel so old and whiny when I'm writing this down\u0085 Obviously I wasn't expecting this movie to become the next \"Psycho\" or \"Rosemary's Baby\", but I guess I really was hoping for a tad bit more creativity, charm and respect for the source material. The creature-features from the 1970's were also far from perfect (like \"Grizzly, \"Squirm\" or even Joe Dante's original \"Piranha\") but at least they were filmed with a lot of dedication and inventiveness. Yep, here I am sounding old and whiny again\u0085 What keeps surprising me about these nowadays horror flicks is how the director manages to convince terrific actors to lose their dignity! Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames stepped out of Aja's original with a relatively unharmed reputation, but here they simply ridicule themselves. And Gary Busey apparently needed some extra money as well. The same can't be said for David Hasselhoff, as he somehow succeeds in fitting this dud of a film right into his already downwards spiral career. He actually spoofs himself successfully by appearing as washed up TV hero typecast as the Baywatch lifeguard and mumbling things that are so true; like \"Welcome to rock-bottom\". Anyways, in case you give a damn: one year after the bloodbath in Lake Victoria, the sleazy businessman Chet counts down the days to open his luxurious and flamboyant water theme park with a very peculiar (and not at all sexist\u0085) gimmick, namely double-d swims for free! He has even foreseen topless adult pools and installed underwater cameras, much to the frustration of his righteous stepdaughter Maddy (who only has a B- cup). But naturally Chet is a corrupt scumbag and his illegal installations pump up the water from underground Arizonan lakes. Those lakes are infested with prehistoric piranhas, a little detail that Chet and his corrupt buddies actually should know considering the Lake Victoria incident, and a couple of mere hours after the grand opening the hideous razor-teethed fish are munching themselves a way through silicone breasts. The highlights of \"Piranha 3DD\" include a fairly atmospheric opening with images of the forsaken Lake Victoria and an awkwardly uncomfortable moment involving a fish preventing a young couple from losing their virginity in a romantic way. The gore is stupidly over-the-top and the piranhas don't come across as menacing whatsoever. If you ask me this is pathetic nonsense, but hey, I'm old and whiny",

Returning to the big screen with everything we loved about the first film, but with even more substance thrown in to entice new fans of the series as well as keeping us existing ones impressed.The movie is set 12 months after the tragic events that transpired at Lake Victoria, where at a nearby lake, the first sign of the piranha's return is beckoned upon two unexpected townsfolk, with a disastrous end. Now, by the lake, a new water park called 'Big Wet' is opening up, to uplift the general public who have had a morbid and disconsolate year, and what better way to attract customers than with scantily dressed women? But our main character Maddy, has caught wind of the recent piranha attack, and is in a desperate race against time to stop the piranhas from feasting on the unexpected public. This leads to some edge of your seat moments that leaves you totally immersed.This is the perfect example of how you don't need a complicated plot to make something great. The casting was perfection. It has all of the recognisable faces such as Danielle Panabaker, Matt Bush and Katrina Bowden. And if these names are not making your jaw hit the floor then the two amazing cameos by Christopher Lloyd and David Hasselhoff certainly will. And let us not forget about the various porn stars scattered around in this movie. You would think that porn actresses can't act to save their lives and they are there for fan service, but this movie has removed this ridiculous stereotype. From the beginning you can sense the raw emotion that these girls are portraying in their characters; from the ecstasy of them enjoying the carefree lifestyle working at the water park, to the anguish they must feel when they see on of their own friends attacked by a ruthless and unforgiving piranha.And you may be thinking that this adrenaline rush of a movie won't have any character development, but that's where you're wrong. There is a love triangle in this movie that can give 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' a run for its money. (Google it) The conflicts between Kyle (Chris Zylk) an old flame of Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), and Barry (Matt Bush) a childhood friend who was secretly in love with our protagonist Maddy is electrifying; it is very rare to see this much passion in modern cinema these days and provides an enjoyable side story to go with the already fantastic plot.The visuals in this movie was very simplistic to the point where compared to some other blockbusters out there, it looks like some kid shot it from his blackberry. But this wasn't a bad thing. It shows that the visuals do not need to be excessive, and it proves that you don't need a ridiculous budget to fund flashy FXs to stick in people's mind (Looking at you Avatar). It also doesn't use cheap 3D tricks like a guy sticking his hand towards the screen, but utilises the 3D to truly emerge you into the movie itself. When a piranha jumps out of the water, you can sense the raw ferocity of it as it homes in on its unexpected targets, which could only be provided with the inclusion of 3D.Walking into the cinema screen, I had very low expectations, but this film has done more than just exceeded them, but made me re-evaluate cinema as a medium. While writing this review I was hard pressed as to what score to give this, as a perfect 10 may not give it justice, to what may be one of the most influential movies of our generation.So I'd like to advise all movies goers to grab their jackets, match down to the cinema and watch this masterpiece of a movie known as Piranha 3DD.",

I still enjoy it now, even though I know the story by heart: it's an affectionately-made B-movie packed with gore, thrills and genuine laughs. There's little not to love about it.Inevitably, I was excited to learn that a sequel was being made, although less so when I found out that none of the creative team were returning. Then I saw the trailer. Then I found out the director was John Gulager, the man behind the godawful FEAST movies. Then I read the reviews. And I decided to hold off seeing it.Now the movie can be picked up for a couple of quid, I thought it was about time I checked it out, and boy, am I glad I waited: PIRANHA DD is an absolutely execrable movie, a pile of piddling nonsense that vomits noisily all over the original film's undeniable charms. I thought the story was slim in the first film, but this hour-long production (the rest is padding) jettisons any plotting completely and just consists of one cheesy piranha attack after another.Even worse, the story from the original isn't carried on; instead, we get a weak retread of what happened in the first. Imagine PIRANHA 3D made as a no-budget, low brow comedy and you'll be close. It's hard to choose what's worse: Gulager's embarrassing direction, which is either all over the place or so overblown as to be cringeworthy, or the shameful script, crafted by about a zillion screenwriters.The piranhas look good, but there's no gore to speak of, and the special effects are really crappy. The acting is poor, too, and the presence of some blink-and-you'll-miss-'em actors like Gary Busey and the returning Ving Rhames/Christopher Lloyd doesn't add up to much. Way too much screen time is given to David Hasselhoff, as the second half of the film forgets its format and genre and just becomes one weak gag after the next.

This leads them to gradually descend upon a recently opened adult swimming pool. The film does try too hard at points. It really attempts to make itself a pastiche rather than just a bit silly. Rhames comes back with metal gun legs, just so he can start shooting. Hasselhoff plays himself, and is actually the runaway star, but what should have been an extended cameo becomes a major role. Piranha 3DD also sets up lengthy jokes, that are kind of funny but not entirely worth the effort. For example a Piranha swims up a girls vagina, and later has sex with her boyfriend, and you can imagine the rest. But this joke is spread out over 20 minutes.

            "content": "After 2010's hit horror remake \"Piranha\" made a killing at the box office ($83 million worldwide on a $25 million budget), Weinstein Company quickly gave the go ahead to make an even campier sequel with the affectionate title \"Piranha 3DD.\" Tentatively scheduled for August 2011, the release date came and went without any word about the film. Weinstein soon announced that they would be releasing the horror sequel in November 2011. Once again, the release date whizzed by with no word from the studio as to when or if the film would be released. Now, on June 1st, the film has finally been released to horror hell. Opening in 83 theaters this weekend, the film is also showing on demand (where I caught it as no theaters within a 100 mile radius of me is playing the flick). With little press and even littler buzz, the film has little to no hope of making waves at the box office. Did Weinstein Company lose faith in the film? Is the film so awful that it simply doesn't deserve a theatrical release and the studios is simply fulfilling contract obligations? Let's take a step into these piranha filled waters and find out.\"Piranha 3DD\" begins one year after the famous attack on Lake Victoria by prehistoric piranhas. Extremely bad press from the incident has left the lake devoid of any life whatsoever. The town itself has been largely abandoned as a result of the drying-up of their main revenue source, tourism by horny spring breakers. At a nearby lake, two middle aged rednecks named Clayton (Gary Busey) and Mo (Clu Gulager) wade into the water to recover the body of a dead cow. Eggs laid inside the cow carcass, and before you can say \"piranha meal\" the farmers are killed by a hungry and very angry swarm of baby piranha.Enter Maddy (the lovely \"Friday the 13th\" remake star Danielle Panabaker) a marine biology student. She returns home for the summer to the waterpark she co-owns. She finds to her horror, and our amusement, that the other co-owner, her step-father Chet (David Koechner), plans to add an adult-themed section to the waterpark with 'water-certified strippers', and re-open it as \"Big Wet\" where the \"double DD's get in for free.\" At a party at the waterpark that night, Maddy encounters several old friends, including her policeman ex-boyfriend Kyle (the enjoyable slimy Chris Zylka), and Barry (Matt Bush) who has secretly had a crush on her since grade-school. She also runs into two of her close friends, Ashley (Meagan Tandy), and Shelby (Katrina Bowden). It doesn't take long to guess who will and won't become piranha bait.Shelby and her boyfriend Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) go skinny-dipping in the lake, where a piranha makes its way inside her you-know-what(yes, you read that right). Meanwhile, Ashley and her boyfriend Travis (Paul James Jordan) go to have sex in their van. They accidentally trip the handbrake, causing the van to roll into the lake, where they are both devoured by the angry piranhas.The next day, Maddy is consoling Shelby about their missing friends. While sitting on a jetty, they are both attacked by the swarm of piranhas. They manage to kill one, and Maddy, Kyle and Barry bring it to Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd even stranger and more over-the-top than he was in the original) to examine. He informs them that the piranhas may be moving via sewage pipes and underground rivers between lakes. The trio return to the lake, where they establish that the piranhas cannot make their way into the outflow pipes connecting the lake and the waterpark.Back at the waterpark, we find celebrity lifeguard David Hasselhoff (played by himself in a hilarious, mocking tone similar to Jennifer Tilly's role in \"Seed of Chucky\") has been hired on as an \"A list\" lifeguard from the waterpark. It doesn't take long before the piranhas find their way to the park to devour and feast on the lovely young teens and the families enjoying their stay at \"Big Wet.\"Sound silly, over-the-top, and preposterous? Of course it is! The film is \"Piranha 3DD\" not \"Schindler's List.\" You want big breasted girls being torn apart by piranhas? You want David Hasselholff running in slow motion to the Baywatch theme to save a drowning ginger boy? You want the death of not one but TWO annoying kids played up for two of the biggest laughs in the movie? Well, you get all of this and a hell of a lot more. Rating a movie like \"Piranha 3DD\" is a different proposition. The film itself is not nearly as good as the original remake (how's that for an oxymoron?) but I would argue that this sequel is a hell of a lot more fun. Take out the 13 minute credits (stay for them, there are some funny bloopers and behind the scenes video) and you are left with a 70 minute nonstop roller-coaster ride that is over before you can even begin to think of the bad acting and nonsensical plot developments. \"Piranha 3DD\" left me craving another sequel and isn't that the best thing you can say about a cheesy horror flick?",

            "content": "Okay, so many negative words about this Piranha entry. Still not available in a lot of countries did mean also a thing. Bad distribution so a bad film. I have seen it in 3D HD and I must say that I am I guess the only one who enjoyed it. But there are a few reasons why I liked it. First of all this flick doesn't take itself seriously and that's a good start. Secondly the name John Gulager, the director, did ring a bell, famous for his directing of the Feast trilogy. And have a look at Feast you know that that is full of bad jokes and black comedy, let that be exactly what we do have here.For example the way 'The Hoff' is presented. A lot of people hated his acting here but just have a close look, he's laughing with his own acting and his past, the kid don't remember any title The Hoff is saying he played in, back to earth with that, and then as he's running like in baywatch. How funny was that and he said it himself when he stops running. Further this flick is some kind of remake of Piranha 3D (2010). Of course people will compare the two with the use of nudity but face it, the penis being bitten off in the 2010 version was laughable too. Here we do have the same but in stead of naked girls swimming in the water we do see a lot of 3D D-cups in close up running around, covered in bikini or topless. And the nudity is as gratuitous as it can be, girls coming out of the water naked full frontal, ladyshaved. Naturally the penis scene had to be done again but again in Feast-style and if you just can't take it or find it ridiculous then you can't dig black comedy. Look how the virgin asks to be f*cked and how she reacts. It's full of subtile jokes. Sure, the story is written in one sentence, Piranha attack a swimming pool. But I laughed it out a few times and of course searched for the old actors to be seen, Gary Busey, Clu Gulager, Christopher Lloyd...On part of the 3D it do have a few amazing scene's. The key for example in the water really did pop up almost just before my face, just if I could grap it. Some piranhas also are jumping out of your screen. I can understand that geeks hate it, there isn't that much of horror in it or even gore. It's all about naked girls and blood, be honest, this is the only reason why you watch this. Guess if you show this at a party that it will succeed in delivering a few laughs and cheers while the girls will walk out of the room and saying, so childish...and that's exactly what it is.

To impress the teenagers also a bunch of bare breasts got added. Probably director John Gulager was so distracted by this human meat show, that he completely forgot to insert a plot of any kind. But does this really matter at this point? I don't think so. Switch your brain off, lean back, stare at the naked bodies, ignore the nonsense lines and get wasted while the movie progresses. The remake was bad already and anybody who expected a sequel to this would do the franchise any good must be out of his mind... or distracted by... you know the drill!",

I have rated Piranha3D (2010) as 10, and this one as \"1\". Can you believe why?\nI request people not to give importance to this movie, rather if you are disappointed watching this one, then recommend to watch Pirahna3D (2010), which is quite better, but again do watch uncut version of the same, if you are in India, and you watch on Indian Television channel, it is again useless as they are many cuts.

            "content": "Oh dear, this was bad! The 2010 remake of the old \"Piranha\" movie was bad, but this sequel to that 2010 remake, are you kidding me? Where to begin?Well let's start with piranha trashing a wooden pier to get to the people on top of it? So fish are able to selectively single out prey and take down the barriers they are on? Or what about piranha jumping out of the water and onto the shore in order to get to their prey? Piranha starting to walk on land? Piranha jumping up and in one bite decapitate a grown man, then later on do the same to a boy? Or a piranha swimming up inside a woman through her private parts and living inside her womb?Or what about the total rip off scenes from the 2010 version? A piranha biting off a man's private parts? Or having a formerly well-known actor (Garey Busey) have a cameo role in the beginning of the movie only to die within minutes? Can you say 'this also happened in part one?' Or a sheriff (Ving Rhames) having lost both his legs in the first movie and now back with two steel legs, one of which is also a shotgun. Or how about David Hasselhoff playing himself and making an ass of his previous roles and personality? This movie was so lame, words don't even begin to describe it.So why watch it? Well, simply because it is such a cheesy spoof on itself and the 2010 version. It was hard to take this movie serious at all. The storyline is downright insulting to your intelligence, but still it is worth watching because it is so predictable, so cheesy and so stupid. And it is worth to watch because of the blood and gore, and because you will be laughing at the absurdity of the entire movie.The entire movie seems like to be directed by a horny teenager for an audience of horny teenagers. There is an excessive amount of nudity, sexual situations and women in little or no clothing at all. So you should take that into consideration before watching the movie, if you are easily offended by such material or situations. And why did a decapitated head have to land right between a woman's enormous breasts? That was so stupid on so many levels.Having seen the 2010 remake and not overly impressed with it, then it was with some hesitation that I sat down to watch this 2012 sequel. Why? Well because I had the movie at hand and had the time to spare. Having seen it now, I can say that they managed to make the piranha story worse than it already was.It was hard to find the bright moments in this movie. But I suppose if you are a teenage boy, this might be right up your alley. Senseless entertainment with blood and a lack of coherent storyline.",

First, for those upset with the sex, um, the title pretty much clues you in. This is total camp, with lots of intentional humor, as well as lots of gore, sex, and pretty much everything but the kitchen sink. If you think you've seen everything, you haven't---I can't recall a movie where my jaw was open half the time, not believing what I was seeing---but it was all in fun. David Hasselhoff's performance was a spot-on parody of himself, and he did it with aplomb---laughed out loud several times during his scenes. And actually, I laughed out loud during this movie more than I did during the two \"Hangover\" movies (which I enjoyed)put together--- and the laughs were in the right spots, for all the right reasons. There were also some very well-executed tension and scare scenes that I was very impressed by. The effects to me were very, very good, considering this isn't the new \"Spiderman\" or \"Avatar\", but again, it isn't trying to be. The piranhas were creepy-fun, and the gore, well, they don't hold back. The filming even was very competent, with the night scenes looking eerie, the pool scenes chaotic, and the sex/boob scenes over-the-top. This is such a great companion piece to the first one--I ordered it \"On Demand\", but will definitely be buying the DVD---I was not disappointed. Oh, and not that it matters, but I'm not some horny teen getting off on this film, I'm a 50 year-old gay man---my partner and I have been together for 20 years, and have very different tastes in movies, but we both agreed at the end of this one that is was a FANTASTIC sequel!",

            "content": "I feel like I need to drain this pool of Piranha as soon as I can.During Oscar time, or pretty much \"The December Push,\" is an award-movie overkill to a lot of critics. They see a ton of well-made, praise-worthy films and hence, the movie dumping ground, or January, is a refreshing time to relax and watch LEAVE YOUR BRAIN AT THE DOOR features.Well, the opposite is true as well. Once you see multiples, or even one horrible movie, like Piranha 3DD, you want to cleanse your palette with a higher class film. After this terrible sequel, I'm ready for a \"freaking Gone With the Wind\" quality of film.** - Thank you, Parker Posey or \"Kitty,\" for that quote I needed from Superman Returns. It fit nicely.I was excited. I loved the first Bmovie, Piranha 3D. No exaggeration on the word \"loved.\" I saw it opening night, when many didn't. I bought the BluRay. And I've seen it probably six times on both DVD and BluRay.The sequel, or 3DD, started off fairly well. It had a very decent Final-Destination-type news reel explaining the previous film's onslaught of prehistoric and deadly piranha in the fictionally named \"Lake Victoria\" (or, really, Lake Havasu, AZ) and if this could happen again. Following, there were awesome throw-backs to the 1970/1980s WHEN ANIMALS ATTACK films, that I cherish, with some unsuspecting young adults that were picked off one-by-one by the killer fish. And in a few unique ways.In addition, they were giving the audience \u2013 way in abundance \u2013 what they were expecting: a ton of water, a reasonable amount of pretty girls and, of course, countless breasts and more.Well, that was all the way to about the 20th minute of 83. From there, sadly, it went straight down the drain and in a hurry with countless missed opportunities.One MTV-Girl/semi-owner of a water park near the original's movie onslaught of prehistoric piranha attacks discovers that these creatures, for some odd reason, are attracted to chlorine in her swimming pools and all-but whimpers: \"Oh, I guess, shucks, something's gotta be done.\"As with most WHEN ANIMALS ATTACK films of decades past, namely Jaws II, a new resort is just opening and they're gambling a tremendous amount of money to open an (in this case) adult theme water park in the shadow of the previous installment's (animal induced) terrorist attack. There's no difference here, in Piranha 3DD. Except, they left all the fun, originality and spark on the beach and not in the water.I know what you're thinking. This movie is \"silly fun.\" A \"guilty pleasure\" in the making. A movie NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. Well, let me assure you: This is beyond the definition of Bmovie. This is beyond BAD.It's sad, as well. As stated, it did start off promising, but once someone was aware of the creatures, once a character had stomach pains because, well, she had one more egg in her than what she was born with, it didn't just get silly, it got incohesive. It got random. It became aimless, fell apart, felt rushed and had absolutely no clue where it wanted to land in the end. Hell, after the incredibly low body count compared to the first one, the end credits of space-filler outtakes wasn't even a grand finale of minimal success they were shooting for.Most surprisingly, despite the advertisements, it was actually doubling the negative D's in anything in regards to carnage or gore. Sure, it still had its moments, but probably contained a third or less of the bloody and gruesomeness of the first feature.And speaking of advertisements, I do have to note, and YEAH, I'm GOING TO SPOIL THIS \u2013 because I care so little of this feature, I'm glad they did trick me in the previews. The one scene in the trailer I couldn't buy was the girl taking the bath and a miniature piranha filtering out through the faucet. Well, mercifully, that was just a dream of the girl. I originally thought, that was damn silly, but then, so is the movie. Thankfully, as completely implausible as that is \u2013 in addition to everything else \u2013 they rightfully stated that could NOT happen, no matter the faux-pas rules they laid forth.Look, listen: I wanted to support this movie. I wanted to stand behind it and was ready to. I believe, while the first film was candid with its convictions of honesty of being a genuine Bmovie, this one was confused on where it wanted to stand and the lack of a well-balanced script was its downfall. During the last two-thirds, or the majority of the feature, it was all-over-the-place in absurdity and never remembered what made the original so brilliant. The danger was gone, the humor lost and even contained way too many slo-mo scenes for \"laughs\" which were neither funny or imaginative. Heck, even the girls (or guys) all looked like they were found on the street, not the eye candy these movies generate, as the first one got correct.IF ONLY the first third of this movie was a \"deleted scene\" on Piranha 3D's BluRay, we could have a nice closure and not waste any time during one of the worst final half's of any movie I've seen.Needless to say: SKIP THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE! There was a reason it was barely released in theatres this weekend: if it was a wide release, it would proved the (human) terrorists actually did win.",

Even though its not a long film, everything moves fast giving plenty of action along the way.Danielle Panabaker is great in the lead role, David Hasslehoff has fun with his cameo and Christopher Llyod laps up his brief screen time.There's a decent amount of blood and gore but definitely nowhere near as much as the first.

Among the biggest positives here is the fact that this one makes for a rather enjoyable time here in detailing the cause away from the location of the first one into a more outrageous setting being quite natural and believable as there's a nice connection here following up the effects of the first one by again using the logical manner of the underground tunnels to explain everything. That of course follows up the even greater fun here of this one's seemingly glorious cheesy nature on display as there's so much fun here during the main attack of the park that it's an immensely enjoyable sequence all on it's own as the action-packed encounters are so fun and bloody that there's a lot to like on that principle alone. The viciousness of the swarm ripping into bodies and generally taking advantage of the different confines around a water-park to make for a rather exciting time throughout here unleashing plenty of action, solid gore and kills here from the savage bites and dismemberments while also giving this the kind of demented atmosphere and fun found in numerous other works here with this one really taking solid advantage of the creatures to pile on some rather goofy, fun scenarios of the creatures appearing where they really shouldn't be. AS well, the fact that this one can certainly play it straight and keep things running along nicely with some suspenseful scenes at times is a great ploy at counteracting the cheesy nature of the rest of the film where it keeps things focused on the seriousness of the creatures by featuring such great early scenes as the attack on the couple in the van as the water rapidly begins filling the van while they try to get out to safety, a later scene where they attack the friends on the wooden dock by launching themselves through the planks knocking them into the water or the fantastic night-time attack in the lake that's really eerie and chilling for the setting and the knowledge of their attacks previously. By combining all this with the fantastically cheesy sexualized attacks on the couple that are quite shocking and disturbing, the rampant well-delivered nudity and feverish gore, there's enough here to make this one wholly enjoyable enough to hold off the minor flaws present. The biggest issue here is the fact that this one tends to go for a lot more of a clich\u00e9d feeling overall here by running through the same notions as the original only it tends to feel even less impactful because of simply running along the same lines. There's a lot of similar ground covered here that came from the original, and it tends to be quite noticeable. As well, the fact that this one was filmed for 3D means that a lot of gore gags and shots look absolutely atrocious and noticeable when seen elsewhere and if that's not the format being shown in it looks awkward and clunky quite often throughout here. Otherwise, this one tended to be quite exciting and enjoyable.Rated R: Extreme Graphic and occasional sexualized Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity and sexual content.",

Some bits of this crappy sequel are truly funny as they are pathetic. One really pathetic moment, making you realize just how pathetic this movie really is, has Rhame's return as a cop (he played a lot of cops, in this type of horror fare) where his legs are now steel springs from the heavy blow he took in the first, that has him walking like Robocop. His replaced legs, also have an added accessory, which will have some of you saying, \"This is the final straw\".

Luckily, his titanium legs have been outfitted with a shotgun with endless ammo, which will help.There's also a scene where a piranha swims into a woman's nether regions and bites off the member of the man who is attempting to deflower her. Keep in mind that she has had the fish inside her for several hours and that will tell you all you need to know about this film and whether or not you should watch it. There's also a scene where the decapitated head of a man motorboats the bloody breasts of a woman, so just know what you are getting into.Christopher Lloyd returns as Carl Goodman, continually explaining how the fish continue to evolve and the connection between the park and the underground river where the piranha make their home. Interestingly enough, the sound of the piranha was not accomplished in this film in the way that Joe Dante did it - recording a dental drill with an underwater mic. Nope. In this film, they're the sound of a chihuahua barking. Trust me, I have a five pound one of these dogs and it may be the most frightening sound you can be awoken by in the middle of the night.Guess how they kill the fish? Yep. They blow them up real good. Then one of them learns how to walk and kills a small child, with the film ending with people taking selfies of the dead kid.If you're looking for a movie that'll get you through the afternoon and perhaps make you laugh, I guess this will fit the bill if you've already seen all of the other Piranha films.",

With that in mind the original \"Piranha 3D\" was surprisingly good, but this one bails on entertainment value and just goes for really obvious, easy jokes. David Hasselhoff as a lifeguard? I'm sure that got a chuckle at the board meeting, but dear Lord don't actually film it. Everything about this script is just lazy. Ever since \"Jaws\" creature features are obliged to have that one character that ignores the threat for his own financial gain, but here it makes even less sense than usual. The waterpark owner KNOWS there are piranhas in the nearby lake he's getting his water from, going as far as to bribe cops on a regular basis to keep it secret. The chances of a piranha-related bloodbath are roughly 99.9%, but hey he made investments or something so let's move on. What kind of a setting is a waterpark anyway, how long does it take to get out of a pool? Not very long apparently, so the last 10 minutes consists of a fake-looking blooper reel that's clearly just there to pad out the running time (and it's still only 83 minutes, not that I'm complaining). I've said it before but I just want to emphasise it: this thing is bafflingly lazy. If even the combined talents of Christopher Lloyd, Ving Rhames AND Gary Busey can't give your movie one entertaining scene, you're doing fundamental things wrong. Nearly unwatchable.",

            "content": "A follow up to 2010's surprise hit remake 'Piranha 3D', this movie sees the killer fish return to menace another resort. This time it's a water park, 'Wet And Wild' run by the sleazy and unscrupulous Chet, played by David Koechner. His step daughter, and 49% owner of the park, Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) is aghast when he reveals the latest attraction \u2013 an 'Adult Pool'. Of course, this pool is complete with strippers and model female lifeguards. But that's only the start of Maddy's troubles as soon the prehistoric killer piranha are found in the lake next door, into which the resort drains water. Chet, along with corrupt Sheriff Deputy, and Maddy's ex boyfriend, Kyle (Chris Zylka) suppress the news to prevent Wet And Wild's opening being delayed. Christopher Lloyd revises his character Mr. Goodman (to whom Maddy turns for advice) from the first movie and is as watchable as ever. Ving Rhames also returns as Deputy Fallon, although this character was seen dying in the last instalment. The story is that only his legs got eaten. Yeah, right! He's only included to provide another continuity link between the films which seems unnecessary, even if he has been fitted with Robert Rodriguez-esque prosthetics. Inevitably piranha get into the water park, leading to mass bloodletting. 'Piranha 3D' was so popular due to its black humour, explicit gore and nudity \u2013 including a 3D naked Kelly Brook! From the double entendre title 'Piranha 3DD, and the promotion material, viewers would naturally expect this release to be even more extreme. In reality, even though there are graphic mutilations, decapitations, a severed manhood, naked women and large breasts \u2013 it's actually tamer than the original! Being an ex gore junkie I can confidently state there's a lot more creatively shed claret in 'Piranha 3D', almost up in the same league as 'Braindead'. Characters in '\u00853DD' are more generic, less thought has gone into their creation. Another factor to consider is the inclusion of David Hasselhoff playing himself, acting as the washed up celebrity opening 'Wet And Wild'. To start with it's amusing watching 'The Hoff' send himself up, but the joke gets flogged to death and gets tired very quickly. I preferred his cameo in 'Spongebob Squarepants The Movie'. Perhaps my biggest gripe is the outtakes and deleted scenes shown over the closing credits. When a film does this I almost always find it an unforgivable breach of the fourth wall, except in Jackie Chan titles. The ending sets up for another sequel, that if made will be a case of even further diminished returns for the audience.",

She's got a deputy Sheriff-her ex-after her, as well as some nerdy guy. When she's out by the lake with her virgin friend, they are attacked by rabid piranhas that also have learned to jump out of the water and destroy solid objects. They, and some other kids, look for the researcher from part I who tells them that the piranhas are learning and developing some skills- not to mention that they are tough critters that can break through steel.The girl tries to warn the stepfather about the danger of piranhas since the water park drains into the lake. But he won't have any of it. And sure enough, the day of the opening of the park, piranhas make it to the pools and eat everything in sight.One would think that there is quite a bit of story in this movie but the way it's handled all of this takes place in 40 minutes or so. And while I'm making it sound like there's some arc to the story, the way it's filmed is like a series of gags, many of them quite disgusting. At 82 minutes or so this movie is incomprehensibly short, and 15 minutes of those are end credits that have a gag reel mixed in. Danielle Panabaker tries to perform and so do a few other folks. She and Katrina Bowden are very attractive but this director can't direct much at all. He can handle teens being sweet and flirtatious, but put these teens in an emergency or horror situation and the director has no clue what to do. There's some nudity as there well should be but not nearly enough. At the beginning the boss promises a \"coochie cam\" but nothing is made of it. When the piranhas attack the water park, suddenly there is no adult section any more.One can't understand why this movie was so botched. Unless there was a lot more gore, violence, and nudity filmed and someone decided not to include it in the final cut. Otherwise why even bother filming a 65 minute movie? However, not a minute more is on the DVD so clearly, this movie was doomed from the get go.My first conclusion after seeing this movie was that the director of this mess, John Gularger, couldn't possibly have directed the brilliant Feast I. I'm not surprised that I'm not the only one to think that. While Piranha 3DD has some resemblance to Feast II, III, none of those share anything with Feast I. Over time any normal director aims to improve and work on something bigger and better. If indeed Feast I was directed by Gulager he's one of the few directors who's getting worse and worse with every movie he directs. Aja's Piranha I wasn't a masterpiece but it was entertaining and well done. This movie is a disaster. And Gulager is the only one to blame here. There is a story, there is a decent cast, a crew that has the technical know-how, but Gulager managed to ruin it all. This guy is becoming the Olivier Megaton of horror movies- everything he touches turns to hell. Perhaps he should stick to acting (?). Or try directing gross teen sex comedies. Just keep this guy from ruining more horror movies. Piranha deserves better and I look forward to part III redeeming this franchise.",

In this sequel it is the other way around which messes up the whole vibe that the first had going for it.To enhance the comedy they tried to parody David Hasselhoff featuring David Hasselhoff himself.And that was an utter disaster.It wasn't funny in the slightest.Add to that the numerous boring sex jokes.I mean one running gag is this Mexican dude with curly hair sticking his Johnson in those holes you can find in swimming pools for sexual relief.

            "content": "It might have been a B-movie, but 2010's 'Piranha 3D' was a wickedly funny horror comedy that mixed bikinis, boobs, bodies and blood for a gory good time. Unfortunately, its filmmaker Alexandre Aja doesn't return for its sequel (whose title is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the size of a certain female anatomy the movie boasts countless gratuitous shots of), and along with Aja's departure sadly is the series' savvy sense of self-parody- so much so that 'Piranha 3DD' ends up typifying, rather than defying as its predecessor did, its genre stereotype as a Bad-movie.To be sure, plot and character was far from our consideration when we approached this movie- after all, both would have simply been functional devices for the movie to get from one bloodbath to another. Here, the trio of B-horror screenwriters Patrick Melton, Marcus Dunstan and Joel Soisson move the setting from the waters of Lake Victoria to a water park known as 'The Big Wet', owned by the sleazy but enterprising Chet (David Koechner) who intends to re-open the place with former strippers as lifeguards and an adults-only nudist pool.Confining the action to one location could have meant a more intense experience, but neither the screenwriters nor director John Gulager are adroit enough to do so. Instead, they let more than half the movie pass before the blood-splattering finale; and when it comes, they rush through it in such a haphazard manner with nary a care for build-up or continuity that it becomes little more than a bloody mess (pardon the pun).Of course, you can't say the warning signs were not there from the start. Hewing closely to Aja's template from the original, Gulager's first sequence involves a cameo by B-movie veteran Gary Busey to herald the return of the carnivorous fish- but the perfunctory manner in which it is filmed matches neither the smarts nor the thrills of \"Jaws\" alumnus Richard Dreyfuss' cameo in Aja's. Ditto for the strip-and-tease sequences that follow- one where a couple accidentally slide into the lake while having kinky sex at the back of their van is unexciting to say the least; while another with the requisite skinny-dipping teenage couple barely raises the temperature before ending all too abruptly.To be fair, Gulager preserves the latter for a more schlocky sequence in which said couple's first act of making love with each other ends up with the male's penis getting cut off after getting bitten by a baby piranha within the female's vagina. This is about the only sequence that matches the gleefully subversive sense of humour from the original (remember the one where two busty girls get chomped up sans their silicone enhancements), but even in what is undoubtedly the highlight of the film, there is a distinct self-consciousness to Gulager's attempt to top the shock value of his predecessor.The same goes for the display of nudity in the movie, where every available opportunity within the water park becomes exploited for some cheap shot of \"double DDs\" cavorting around the pool or bouncing down waterslides. Certainly, B-movies like this are built on excess, but there needs to be some restraint before the excess goes into overkill. Gulager unfortunately overkills both the nudity and the gore in the film, and without method to the mayhem, you'll soon become indifferent to what was meant to provoke and/or titillate.As if mirroring our numbness to the chaos on screen, the acting by a rag- tag group of B-teen actors are particularly lifeless. You'll care little about the fates of Chet's marine-biologist stepdaughter Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), or her ex-boyfriend and town sheriff Kyle (Chris Zylka), or her nerdy but nice best friend Barry (Matt Bush)- let alone their obligatory love triangle. Getting David Hasselhoff to play himself in the form of a washed-out celebrity lifeguard post-Baywatch is fun at the start, but Gulager's heavy-handed tendencies means that the wink-wink perf gets stretched to the point of tedium.The ineptness of this sequel is a pity really- for we were so looking forward to more of the B-movie exploitation thrills that 'Piranha 3D' let its audience chew on the last time round. But even with the key elements- babes, boobs and blood- intact, this is a largely toothless attempt at recapturing the sly humour and visceral excitement of the original. It is even more pointless in 3D, deployed in such a thoughtless fashion that its only purpose seems to be to cause an unnecessary strain to the eye.",

            "content": "I don't know about you, but I have never seen 20-somethings at any real beach or pool swimming dressed like they were going to a college class. But just as in the original \"Piranha 3D,\" our hero men are fully dressed whenever they're in the water. It's a startling contrast to the treatment of women, who are usually naked or, at most, wearing a skimpy bathing suit. I know the target audience is 19-year-old guys, but I can't believe they'd be squeamish about men being shown in a realistic way. Look at the Hollister Co. website! Even in a bedroom sex scene, the guy's upper body is mostly covered up by a sheet. There is a very brief nude scene with him, but it's more of a flash cut compared to the women's scenes. With \"Piranha 3D\" I speculated the male lead of that film wore a shirt during the big rescue scene because he has a large tattoo on his arm in real life. Maybe that's the case with all of the young male stars today? Now, there is one exception: David Hasselhoff, in a role as a lifeguard, is shown with his shirt off -- but he probably should have left it on. Aside from this strange double standard swimming attire, \"Piranha 3DD\" tells essentially the same story as its predecessor, except with a new cast and more confined location. Aside from a sympathetic performance by Matt Bush, we don't get to know any of these characters well enough to care about them. The script is mostly series of vignettes of characters who just appear, get killed, and we move on to the next random couple. I laughed a few times at some unintentionally funny situations, but there really is no plot, other than the formula that repeats scene after scene. The biggest flaw is opening the show with a summary from the first film. This preempts any kind of mystery element in the first act. I saw this is a major theater on a Friday night...I was the only one in the house. I guess that sums it up best.",

Of course, I was never expecting to see a masterpiece from a movie with such title... But at least I was hoping for something just as self-consciously trashy, funny and splatter as the deliciously camp B-movie first part (which itself was a remake) directed by Alexandre Aja in 2010.There have been several trashy splatter/exploitive horrors in the past (mainly in the 80s and early 90s) which I still consider classics within their own genre (Re-Animator, Society, possibly even Tremors and to a degree the Evil Dead movies just to mention a few). Why couldn't this have been one of them? All the ingredients seemed to have been there: an R rating (18 here in the UK), tits-galore right from the title, exploitive 3D, horrible little hungry monsters (piranha in this case), and a series of more or less famous stars willing to play along...Unfortunately what I found was the most un-inventive, uninspired, un-funny, un-scary, dull piece of junk I have seen in a very long time... (Well, I guess that by itself is quite an achievement since I do watch quite a lot of movies). Yes, it's boring too, despite being only 83 minutes long.How can somebody like Christopher Lloyd, the man with a resume sporting such masterpieces like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Back to the Future, could have accepted to have his name associated with such an insult to human intelligence is beyond me! Was your rent really so behind, Chris?The film is badly conceived, badly filmed, really badly post-converted into 3D (possibly the worse conversion I've seen since a cheap stereoscopic comic I had when I was 10!). The story (if we can call it such) makes no sense (there's a piranha in the swimming pool... well, get the f**k out it!). The characters (again... characters?!) all merge into one and even the gore is way below anything one would have hoped for such a movie and most of the potentially gruesome stuff is happening off camera (I guess they didn't have enough imagination to figure out how to make it on camera!)For the first 30 minutes or so, you don't really know how to take it. It seems a film aimed at 14 or 15 years old kids who are hoping to get a peek at some boobies for the first time in their lives... except that this film is actually rated 18...which kinda defeats that purpose. So in the beginning it all starts building up as a straight horror (a bad one of course, but still a horror). Only once David Hasselhoff shows up you actually begin to get a hint of the fact that this is all supposed to be taken for a laugh... If only it were remotely funny. The \"jokes\" (please notice the inverted commas) are so puerile and genuinely unfunny that it becomes almost embarrassing. Not only we are not laughing with it, but we are not even laughing at it... in fact we are just not laughing at all.This is one of the few films where not even the endless outtakes during the end credits can make you smile (And when I say 'endless' I do mean really endless.. What an indulgent and embarrassing moment!. There is nothing worse than seeing a whole bunch of actors and grown-up film-makers laughing at things which are not even remotely funny to us outside.To be honest, I think the film doesn't even deserve such a detailed review, so I'll just stop here and urge you to give it a miss, even (and especially) if you love this genre. wp.me/p19wJ2-xt",

You know there's a problem with a horror movie when the end-credits montage of gags and jokes is more entertaining than the whole damn movie.I'm really thankful I waited for the DVD release of this movie instead of watching it on the big screen. The only consolation I got was the fact that I didn't spend as much after watching that disaster called GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE and LOCKOUT.",

            "content": "Piranha 3DD (2012)* 1/2 (out of 4) For some reason after the limited success at the box office on the first film they decided for another. This sequel picks up a year after the events in the first film as a new waterpark is about to open and sure enough the piranha are on their way. This is a pretty cheaply produced sequel that's only a few notches above stuff like MEGA PIRANHA that airs on the SyFy channel. I'll admit that I wasn't a fan of the first film but I was curious as to what they'd try here and I'm sad to report that they really didn't try anything. Instead of coming up with something new or original, they've instead just made a copy of the previous film, although I'll give this one credit for not being as annoying. This sequel has cheap and rip-off written all over it as there's really nothing new that happens. The film starts off with some celebrity cameos, we get a perverted guy (this time running the park), we're introduced to victims and then the idiots go into the water and the fish come. There's really nothing fresh here and it's clear that the producers and director weren't interested in anything excepting getting the film done cheaply. It looks rather ugly, the CGI fish are very cheap looking and the overall feel of the movie just doesn't feel like something that would be shown theatrically. The one \"original\" thing is a piranha rape. Yes, I did just write that. The performances aren't too bad and like the first one we get some celebrity cameos. One of the few highlights comes from David Hasselhoff spoofing himself in some pretty funny scenes. Other familiar faces on hand include Gary Busey, Christopher Lloyd, Clu Gulager and Ving Rhames (don't ask). PIRANHA 3DD runs a mere 70-minutes not including the end credits. The total running time is 83-minutes but this is due to outtakes and a few other things during the end credits.",

There are strokes of genuine genius in PIRANHA 3DD: Gulager takes standard softcore sexploitation scenes that in lesser hands would've been forgettable and turns them into moments to be remembered. Like the FEAST Trilogy, PIRANHA 3DD is tongue-in-cheek(s): we see the piranhas gaining entry into their victims via any and all orifices. One of my favorites gags is the one where the water park owner inadvertently \"clotheslines\" himself while trying to get away (which leads into another favorite scene, which I call the \"juggling jugs\" scene- a scene Kitten Natividad would envy); another would have to be the cowardly deputy sheriff who finally summons up the courage to rescue survivors of the attack and wades around carrying the nearly skeletal remains of a victim, shouting, \"Medic! Medic!\" Part sexploitation, part FXploitation, PIRANHA 3DD delivers the goods.",

Of course I didn't expect anything deep in this movie but plain and simple even more over the top gore as could be seen in the first part. Unfortunately, Piranha 3DD did not deliver as expected. Instead, you get lots and lots of completely stupid scenes, that don't even ad up in any way (and I don't mean in really making sense, cause a movie like this doesn't really make sense at all, but they should at least \"work\") but that are plain and simply not thought through at all. As an example: Why does the fish in the water tank doesn't just jump out? They can jump out of lakes as well, can't they? Or how does the bus land somehow in the midst of the lake, why cant that guy rip the tiny chain from the toy-handcuffs open and so on). All in all, it feels like I just wasted 1 1/2 hours that I could have spent watching the rain outside. Even the outtakes in the end are not funny at all. I can only speak for myself but I must say after enjoying the first part this sequel is a sheer disappointment.",

The thing is though it just loses shock factor and the death scene aren't crazy as the one that came before. The first one had a crappy story as well and the actors didn't take it seriously but it seemed like it at least had some effort put into it. But this one just seemed like a quick cash in, with nothing that stands out. It just seemed like a rehash of the first one with the same or similar grotesque scenes. That has hardly anything different, except the Piranha is bigger this time around and the setting takes place at a water park with lots of naked girls. The humor in this one is slightly more messed up though that sometimes works. Overall if you feel like killing time it might be alright to see this, won't be seeing it again that is for sure.4/10",

Overall, it's just like one of those rip-off movies that comes out for rental right before a major movie comes out on disc. Maybe not a good example, but when Tom Cruise's War of the Worlds was due to be released, you saw knockoffs like \"War Between Worlds\". Those movies are drudgery to get through. It's cheap to have actors recite lines for 85 of the 90 minutes of a movie, and build a plot based upon that; but that's a different genre. When it's done and marketed as a comedy or horror, then that's a cheap rip-off. Dialog is cheap. Good, funny dialog (good writers and actors), and SFX are not cheap.Just like a knockoff, this movie tries to be funny and fails. It tries to make you care (big mistake for comedy-horror), and really falls flat on it's face with bits of drama that are tedious to get through. Special FX are blown away by Sci-fi channel direct to disc releases. The original's SFX were not state-of-the-art all the time (most scenes were though, especially where there's gore), this one the SFX are not even TV-show decent. This would have been forgivable if the movie wasn't so boring in between those few shots. Overall, this is a boring, PG-13 movie that fails in every genre. It's not even so bad that it's funny (I watch some very low-grade B-Movies too). It's better than Thankskilling, but at least TK hit it's intended low mark of humor and quality. I'd put this movie in the same league as Black Swarm or Blood Monkey.The only reason someone would see this is because of the titular link to the fantastically better movie, or because there's bodacious boobies on the box. Renting this and expecting either of these components to be there even in high dilution will surely disappoint you.

After all, you'd have to be a complete idiot if you were. However, even B-movies should be better than this. \"Piranha 3DD\" follows the story of a group of teenagers working at a wet and wild water park not far from the lake where the first one took place at. We learn that the main girl is part owner of the park with her sleazy stepfather who, to his stepdaughter's dismay, has tuned the park into an adult playground, even going so far as to hire strippers as lifeguards, (How did he get that past local regulators). The stepfather is also pumping water from a local well that connects to an underground river. I think an intelligent person knows where this is going. The Piranhas attack and its up to the teenagers to save the day. If only they could act, they just might of pulled it off. There are a few cameos from such greats as Gary Busey, Christopher Loyd, and Ving Rhames. Sadly, there are not in the movie very much at all. Then there's the ridiculous cameo of David Hasselhoff (David Hasselhoff??!! Dose he even have a career anymore?) who gives an unfunny performance if one can call it that. So to wrap it all up, the piranhas kill just about everyone, get sucked out by some super powerful suction system, and then everyone celebrates despite the fact that they failed to save anyone.

Overall, this film is highly immature, always aiming low and gleefully ignoring anything resembling good taste. But if this kind of thing floats your boat, it *does* generate some hearty chuckles, with its plethora of fishy predators, and in your face visual effects and gore. It establishes a comical, cheesy and sleazy tone almost immediately, with a scene involving Gary Busey (who's seen much too briefly).The story, such as it is, sees the aquatic menaces arriving at a water park in Arizona, thanks to the meddling of cheerfully scuzzy operator Chet (David Koechner). His conscientious stepdaughter Maddy (the adorable Danielle Panabaker) realizes that they have a serious problem, but of course *he's* not going to believe her until it's too late.Led by director John Gulager, the makers of \"Piranha 3DD\" do have fun with their various cameo appearances. In addition to Busey, we have Christopher Lloyd and an uncredited Ving Rhames rehashing their roles from Alexandre Ajas' film, director Gulagers' actor father Clu, and David Hasselhoff, who has fun playing a jerky version of himself. There's lots of very sexy gals and guys, and a rather overbearing soundtrack. Some of the gags are *incredibly* crude, such as those involving the lovely Katrina Bowden, Jean-Luc Bilodeau as Josh, and Adrian Martinez, playing the aptly named Big Dave. The splatter is very much over the top. The movie proper is capped off by some VERY protracted end credits that feature a number of outtakes.Undoubtedly, this will be MUCH too stupid for some tastes, but others will likely be delighted.Six out of 10.",

Now it's up to Maddy, a young gal who co-owns half the water park, to get the people out of the water.The first Piranha delivered the right amount of blood and camp to make it enjoyable. There were scenes that were over the top hilarious and going in knowing this helped a lot. In this uninspired sequel the setting has been changed to a water park. Huge mistake. I don't really know where to start. Lets start with the 3D. It manages to be worse than the original. Which is bizarre considering the filmed this entry in 3D. This film is a huge disappointment. I went in expecting it to be AT LEAST, half as fun as the original. I knew what I was getting myself into, but I didn't expect it to be utterly unwatchable. Not even the cameo of THE HOFF can save this trash.I don't expect good acting, but I don't expect direct to video fare, especially from people like Panabaker, Bowden and Koechner. The worst aspect of this film is the script. Horrible, utterly horrible. The poor excuse they have for the piranhas getting into the park is ridiculous, the situations the characters find themselves in is laughable. A van going into the water, people stuck inside and on top. The worst offender is when two characters are \"stuck\" on a dock and the piranhas are destroying the wooden planks from underneath. Not only the worse scene in the film, but probably one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in my life. Poorly acted, directed, edited and written. The entire film is lazy. The fun is gone, most of the laughs are from The Hoff, but even that wears thin quickly. Gary Busey has a small role in the beginning, the film seriously needed more of him. He never had the opportunity to get his crazy on. The scene where he bites the head off the fish and spits it out is in the trailer, that's all he does. Ving Rhames has his best part ruined in the trailer a well. The film doesn't take itself seriously, which is obvious from the get go with dead fart jokes, but the comedy is more miss than hit. I laughed twice, one involving child endangerment the other is the Baywatch parody. The naked women were even excessive and unneeded. It all feels forced to capture the exact same formula of the first, but the water park setting doesn't work for that. One thing this film lacked were the Kelly Brook and Riley Steele characters. Here Koechner fires all the lifeguards and hires strippers. The stripper lifeguards do nothing, opportunity wasted. A ridiculous sex scene puts this film over the top. The scene doesn't play it funny enough, or grotesque enough. It's caught in some odd place in the middle. Yet the film seems to keep the tradition of severed penises afloat. Absolutely no plot whatsoever. The original at least tried, the sequel makes no effort. The attack is actually boring. Not as gory or as fun as the original. It seemed to be cut fairly badly too. This film is tamer, lamer and something that rhymes with lamer. It makes no effort at all. Usually with sequels you want to go bigger and better, not the case with Piranha 3DD. The film is incredibly short, so expect to see ten or so minutes of outtakes during the credits. Even going in expecting it to be bad doesn't prepare you for the awfulness you will endure.",

She goes with the two other members of the love triangle - the guy we definitely want her to not hook up with, and the one who hasn't had her yet - to find Mr. Goodman(Christopher Lloyd, in a slightly expanded role, still delivering exposition), to learn how they got from... wherever it was that the original took place to Arizona. That's the excuse for a plot, and yes, several of its threads, all of the characterization(who needs people in a movie for the audience to care about, even on a base level?), and the half of the conflict that doesn't involve man-eating fish... all revolve around sex. How slutty or sleazy(depending on the gender) is someone, will these two get it on, etc. And yes, this does have plenty of graphic nudity(the full female body is seen, from several angles) and hot chicks, although that is indeed the only area where it delivers. This is absent the violence and gore(largely... and what there is, is forgettable and not worth mentioning, like this as a whole) of the remake, not to mention all the directorial skill, suspense and tension. In place of build-up, we have padding inbetween ill-executed attacks(I have to wonder if they just left the editing up to an intern, one sequence is particularly terribly assembled). Well, there is set-up to eventual half-hearted payoff, even if a couple of these directly contradict one another(either the script was written by several people who had no contact with each other, or one guy with a debilitating case of ADHD). I think it tries to be scary at points, but it fails completely. Instead, it goes for comedy, which it does about as poorly at. In the 75 minute running time(not counting the credits), there are two or three jokes that actually work, all involving either Ving Rhames(inexplicably back) or David Hasselhoff(playing himself, making fun of his fame-loving, fan-adoring has-been status). The rest are too dumb, nonsensical or uninspired. I've been told that this reuses animations from the 2010 one... while I can't say for sure(it wouldn't surprise me though, this whole flick is one \"long\" attempt to cash in on its success), I can verify that the creatures seldom look like they're interacting with the live-action elements... it's a remarkably bad job of integrating the two. They'll swim around their victims and bite at the viewer far more than at them. I recommend this only to those who want more of the T&A that make up the only noteworthy use of 3D in this. 1/10",

This time the action switches to a waterpark co-owned by cutie Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) in which the highly aggressive prehistoric piranhas invade via sewage pipes, attracted by chemicals involved in swimming pool cleansers that match their spawning routes. Christopher Lloyd returns as the marine expert who officials write off while David Hasselhoff appears as himself, a has-been celebrity making an appearance at the waterpark. The original 1978 film was a great semi-serious/parody of Jaws-like flicks, but neither of the two recent Piranha flicks have been able to rise to its level. But at least this one is a little better than the somewhat disappointing 2010 movie. While it goes overboard with crudeness (you'll know what I mean) it is genuinely amusing and I found myself busting out laughing on several occasions, especially the last scene before the credits where little Johnny (or whatever his name is) makes the mistake of getting too close to a supposedly dying piranha. The Hasselhoff subplot is hilarious. The movie's entertaining but, at the end of the day, \"Piranha 3DD\" is what it is: a throwaway horror comedy. The movie runs 83 minutes and was shot in North Carolina with opening shots of Lake Victoria filmed at Salton Sea, California.GRADE: C",

It's hard to even write a review on this film because it is literally that bad there is no plot at all, the film is just sex and gore. I can honestly say I never laughed once not even a small chuckle or a smile I sat almost angry that I had actually even given this film hope to be OK. It's so boring to watch and you are just waiting for it to end.

            "content": "Given the deluge of bad reviews I read before hand, not to mention the low IMDb score, I almost skipped this sequel to a remake. I loved the first one (as many detractors proclaim) and they all seem to hate this one. Glad I ignored the bad buzz, P3DD is a wonderfully exploitive gore-comedy that never takes itself seriously.The Plot: After the events of the first film, the infamous lake is sealed off and the titular piranhas are killed off, effectively turning the lake into a wasteland, but seemingly ending the threat. Months later, however, some fish that survived the extermination travel through an underground river and find a new home in the form of an adult-themed water park. Blood, guts, and oodles of nudity quickly ensue.I will admit that even without the bad press, I was reticent about seeing this. When I heard that Alexandra Aja was not returning and was being replaced by John Gulager, my concern skyrocketed. Gulager directed \"Feast\", which was awesome, but he also directed \"Feast 2\" and \"Feast 3\", which are both just barely watchable (and that's being generous). Fortunately, P3DD falls more in line with the former.What's done right? Quite a bit really, if you have a mind for silly gore-comedies that is. From the first scene in the move, there are blood and guts aplenty and it keeps coming at steady intervals all the way up to the limb-lopping climax. At just about equal amounts is nudity and sexual situations; this movie almost gleefully wears its perv-badge on its chest. Not that there is anything wrong with any of that (quite the contrary), just letting you know what you are in for. Compared to most films the movie is extremely gory, though judged against the first one it actually comes up a little short.Most of the cast changes (ie, nearly everyone) work perfectly. The lovely Danielle Panabaker takes the lead role this time around and is immediately enjoyable in the role while David Koechner plays the same kind of slimy (yet oddly likable) jerk he often does in similar films. The rest of the cast are all pleasantly game for the shenanigans going on, but the two main standouts are the cameos by Ving Rhames and David Hasslehoff. Rhames (being only one of three returning actors) get a great scene involving hydrophobia and how he comes to deal with it, while the Hoff gets most of the best jokes in the movie.Not everything is perfect. For one, the movie is really short; it clocks in at only 83 minutes and that's WITH a 13-minute credit sequence (make sure to not skip the blooper filled credits, they are hilarious). With only 70 actual minutes of story time in the film, you really don't every get around to caring about the fate of anyone in the film; good or bad, alive or dead, no one's fate leaves any real impression on you. Another issue connected to the running time is the bare-bones script; plotting happens VERY quickly and often with little explanation or elaboration. Characters are underdeveloped and are introduced and then killed off with nearly frightening frequency.But then again, are those really things to complain about in a film like this? You don't go to see a movie called \"Piranha 3DD\" expecting deep plotting or award winning acting. You (should) go in expecting exactly what you get: blood, guts, and nudity. And in that regard the movie succeeded marvelously.7/10",

            "content": "Most of the reviews for Piranha 3DD have absolutely savaged it and all of them are right up to a point. The production values suck despite the reported 20 million dollar budget and as for the gore and nudity: seen it all before.But as bad as Piranha 3DD is, it does have one redeeming feature that most reviewers overlook: it's not dull. I mean if there was a choice between watching Piranha 3DD again or sit through The English Patient, I know which flick I'd pick in a heartbeat.Like most sequels, Piranha 3DD is really just a remake, or rehash, of the first Piranha, there's lots of T&A, a male genital mutilation (which I could do without), plenty of shredded bodies and fake blood. Plus lots of closeups of ugly and furious CGI flesh eating fish. The action this time takes place at a water park-the kind of \"Girls Gone Wild\" establishment that only exists in bad movies.The script tries to straddle the fence between horror and comedy and fails on both accounts; all the scary and shocking scenes are well telegraphed ahead of time and the humor is of the lazy Scary Movie type, such as when a character is decapitated by a plastic yellow ribbon tape. All of the main characters are clich\u00e9s: horny early twenty somethings whose uncontrollable sexual urges leads them to doom. Only the chaste girl and the boy who has an unrequited love for her survive unscathed.Christoper Lloyd and Ving Rhames are back from the first movie, basically doing parodies of themselves, while Gary Busey is wasted in a cameo part in the opening scene. But David Hasselhoff proves yet again that he is a good sport, spoofing his Baywatch persona; his appearance is the one truly funny part of the movie that really works.Read the bad reviews and consider yourself warned, but just remember,bad isn't the same as boring, and Piranha 3DD isn't the latter by a long shot.",

            "content": "Piranha 3D (2010) was almost the dictionary definition of a guilty pleasure. Amusing, chock full of gratuitous nudity and gore gags and with solid turns from a bunch of thesps who have maybe moved on from their peak, all held together by the sure hand of not exactly reliable director Alexandre Aja. It did what it set out to do with a little bit more for good measure.So Piranha 3DD must have seemed like a good idea \u2013 keep up the funny, keep up the gore, stock up on some more recognisable actors willing to splash around in water and karo syrup for a few weeks \u2013 bob is your Aunt's husband. The attempt to bottle the same lightning twice has much less stable results. The basic plot, even from the outset, seemed nervously similar to the terrible Jaws 3D and balances on a ridiculous premise. But we didn't come to a Piranha sequel and not expect our disbelief to be suspended and we haven't come for the plot, it's a sketch to set up the funny, boobs and blood.The thought that we might not get the same level of funny, boobs and blood is suggested by the opening attack, featuring a very odd looking Gary Busey, which struggles to find ground between fart gags and a reasonable reintroduction of the prehistoric, flesh stripping fishies. From then on, the quality is variable. Many of the same elements are there but handled with a lot less control. The sole honourable exception being a sex scene that does handle a video nasty level, body horror moment with some gross out panache. That one aside, all of the gore gags lack the flair that Aja brought to the first one. Danielle Panabaker struggles to manage a role that is both a thumb nail sketch and an attempt to merge the Sheriff Mom and girlfriend roles from the original. Others such as Matt Bush and Chris Zylka are all fine but again their roles are sketched almost to the level of caricature, making it impossible to care what happens to them one way or the other \u2013 when we're obviously meant to root for one to save the day and the other to get his comeuppance.David Koechner is good value as the sleazy opportunist park owner but his role seems to have been lifted wholesale from at least a couple of other movies. Katrina Bowden's character comes off as being impossibly exposed but also impossibly difficult to kill, which is very strange. Despite this and her turn in Tucker & Dale, her acting talents are still probably best showcased by her semi recurring role in 30 Rock. Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd both return briefly and in their couple of scenes manage to showcase what the flick is lacking.So, more of the same with diminishing returns. To be expected but it might surprise you how much the returns have been diminished. This is probably not the flick that you'll turn to as a drunken night winds down, I doubt I'll ever say the words \"Fuck it, let's watch Piranha 3DD again.\"There's also way more David Hasselhoff than should be allowable under the Human Rights Act.Oh yeah. The running time. The film proper lasts exactly 70 minutes \u2013 that's one hour and ten minutes. The remainder of the advertised 82 minutes is 3 different credit sequences padded with bloopers, deleted scenes, more Hasselhoff (!) and weirdly a behind the scenes sequence of the final scene. You may feel cheated, you may feel like applauding the Corman level usage of all the footage you can. I didn't care either way, which is the problem with Piranha 3DD in a nutshell.",

This film has nothing.The performance, probably due to Gulager's lack of skill as a Director, were woeful, there is no clever dialogue, David Hasselhoff is totally wasted (as in they didn't make use of having him, not he was off his face!).Gary Busey is in it for 3mins as is Christopher Lloyd. The most interesting part of the film were the out-takes at the end and by watching those (most of which didn't make the final cut) you can see what a total butchered, slapped together abortion of a film it ended up being.It's a total stinker, probably the worst, sloppiest piece of crap I have seen in 10yrs.",

The follow-up to 2010's critically acclaimed box-office success \"Piranha\" did little business in theaters. Hopefully it will gain a little more attention from home audiences.A school of mutated piranhas enter a water park through its piping systems. The step-daughter of its crooked co-owner must find a way to close off the man-eating creatures' access to the amusement facility. The employees of the park attempt to rescue the thrill-seeking swimmers before they're devoured by the aquatic monsters.Roger Corman's name may not be found in the credits of this sequel, but his spirit is felt throughout it. It's the usual over-the-top creature feature we've all become accustomed to seeing from the B-movie king. Imagine \"Jaws\" if it took place in a water park the kids in \"Porky's\" worked at during the summer. That's the level of entertainment you get from watching \"Piranha 3DD.\"The CGI and practical effects are a grade above what one would expect from a movie of this nature. There are parts where the piranhas look less than spectacular, but it doesn't distract from the overall fun atmosphere of the film. Most of the special make-up effects are very well-done. The different severed body parts all look impressively realistic.\"Piranha 3DD\" delivers B-movie schlock in its finest form. I don't know how it could get any better (or worse?) than this. It's crude, gory, funny, and successfully self-aware. A great high-definition transfer and a few interesting special features make this a recommended buy for fans of Roger Corman creature features and the likes. http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",

Sure there was some goofy part and plenty of boobs but Aja never let the film cross that line that would turn it into a horror spoof and it was a real love letter to those type of films. Now they made a sequel without Aja and honestly , they should have just called this \"Scary movie 6\" . This was like a spoof of the original.

Yes, you saw that coming, didn't you?Written by Joel Soisson to work on what Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan of various Saw and Feast films had already written, I'm pretty sure the signs on how well this sequel will fare in the story department would be telling from the filmography that Soisson had worked on. Don't expect much to come out of Piranha 3DD other than to rehash the same violent mess of the first film, only this time it seemed that Gulager may have opted for this to be a wee bit friendlier from a gore standpoint, reserving much of the bloody mayhem for the final 20 minutes in what would be too little too late, complete with plenty of cheese in the entire buildup.The characters here are mostly new, revolving around Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) who had returned to her hometown for the summer holiday to find that her 49% share of her mother's water based theme park had been turned into a strippers on water joint by stepdad Chet (David Koechner), which of course gives rise to many opportunities for gratuitous nudity to grace the screen, from boob and ass shots, to full frontal if deemed necessary, complete with silicone on display. While the first film also had its fair share of such scenes, the ones here are purely exploitative and done for the sake of, even a sex scene (where nothing much happens) provides for a ludicrous development that threatened to be somewhat like Aliens, only played out much differently for a mix of meek laughs, and for a terribly lame one-liner to be uttered.While the first film had a comical element associated with it, this follow up paled in comparison no thanks to many unbelievable one liners that don't hit their mark, and I wonder how anyone can deliver them with a straight face. That, and plagued with a story that is pretty much non-existent, peppered with more caricatures that are in it to become fodder one way or another, lending to the death count prioritized as dictated by the usual horror film rules. The saving grace came from the supporting cast who returned for yet another outing, such as Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd, but the one who stole everyone's thunder when he first came on for the final half hour, is David Hasselhoff, playing a satirical version of his star status, with that Baywatch body now blessed with man boobs, and hamming it up to be so full of himself, it's painfully funny.It's a pity then for this 3D movie, which being shot in 3D, had plenty of gimmicky designed shots to enhance the in-your-face experience. There's nothing much to the story except to link up scenes for the Piranhas to feed on unsuspecting bodies, usually in different states of undress. Naturally that in itself may be a draw for some sections of the movie going crowd. Stay tuned during the end credits for a lot more extra scenes not seen in the film proper. Strictly for B-movie fans who find delight at man eating fish going on a feeding frenzy, and for fans of David Hasselhoff.",

It was everything I expected - gratuitous, daft and plenty of blood flowing.Therefore, I was quite happy to sit down and watch the sequel, expecting more of the same. To be fair, I got it, however, it just didn't seem to have worked this time.What I got was a blatant Jaws clone - instead of a man trying to shut the beach because of a great white shark, you have a girl trying to shut a new fun pool because of the piranhas. I don't know whether this was some sort of 'homage' to the superior Jaws movie, or whether it was sloppy writing. Either way, it just didn't sit well with me.Yes, there is gore and plenty of women in bikinis, but it just didn't feel as fresh the second time round.David Hasselhoff is in it, happy to lampoon himself, which goes some way to squeeze in a few extra laughs in the second half.It's short too, just over an hour. You'd have thought they could have fitted better in, but, sadly, it was a bit of a let down.I don't regret watching Piranha DD. It kept me entertained, but, if you're looking for blood, carnage and bikinis - just stick to watching the first one. You won't miss anything by not seeing this.",

This movie has no limits, it is crude, the characters are disgusting, and the violence towards children was so unexpected I actually laughed, this movie has balls. There is no acting whatsoever, no plot, nothing intriguing, nothing but cheap attempts at humour and pointless scene after scene. The first film was somewhat enjoyable, but this film is bad, made exclusively for teenage boys, the only people who could enjoy this content. The Hoff was mildly amusing, same with Ving Rhames. If you want garbage look no further, the only things lower than this are teen comedies or rape/torture movies.

            "content": "A sequel to 2010's surprise hit Piranha 3D stars an ensemble cast of large breasted girls and handsome men plus a few D List comedy actors and well known faces in a battle of fish vs man. The action is transported to a water park in Arizona where sleazy Chet (David Koechner \u2013 Anchorman) has made some changes to his late wife's park. These include hiring strippers as lifeguards and the use of a dodgy water supply. His daughter in law Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) is home for the summer and shocked at the changes. With rumour of Piranha on the prowl she tries to close the park but finds that she is already too late.I really enjoyed Piranha 3D. It took me completely by surprise and was funny, rude and ridiculous. Piranha 3DD has all the same ingredients but has added more rude and ridiculous and toned down the funny. The result is pretty much the same film as the original but has lost what made it unique as it's all been seen before. There is nothing new and the 'story' isn't progressed but it has the odd moment which made me smile and plenty which made me cringe.The acting is terrible beyond belief. This may be perhaps because the casting director went for looks over acting ability but in the end it doesn't matter. In a way the bad adding adds to the fun. None of the unknowns stand out in terms of their acting but Christopher Lloyd's cameo was good, although smaller than in the first instalment. David Koechner was as sleazy and creepy as you'd want him to be and David Hasslehoff joins the fun playing The Hoff in a turn that may make him unable to look at himself in the mirror (if he still could).There is one scene which will probably remain in people's minds and involves Katrina Bowden (Tucker & Dale vs Evil, American Reunion), a small piranha, a man and a knife. It's probably the best scene and although unbelievably ridiculous and disgusting it's quite fun. The rest of the film is forgettable and with character names such as Shelby, Chet and Clayton, you'll find yourself willing the piranha on.The piranhas look if anything worse than they did in the first film. The CGI was perhaps cheaper or more rushed but in the water they looked less realistic. On land (oh yes, they are on land now) they look a bit more real but this is still not a strongpoint of the franchise. The 3D was downright dreadful. The first film was one of only two films along with Hugo in which I thought the 3D added something. In this, apart from about 10 shots of piranhas swimming at the screen and bouncing chest puppies the 3D was redundant and a lot of the film looked fuzzy. I've always thought that this is the sort of film in which 3D could be used to great effect but it wasn't here.If you enjoyed Piranha 3D then you might enjoy this but to a lesser extent. If you hated the first film then you will hate this even more. It isn't as fun as the first, manages to be both ruder and less sexy and the final action sequence isn't even as big as the original but it's 83 minutes of silliness that does exactly what it sets out to do.www.attheback.blogspot.com",

This is my point, why try to sell a film just from a male heterosexual attribute, I find this sexist, and just plain dumb film making. This is not a film, this is just stupid cocky rich kids trying to make a \"movie\" with the backing of a rich arrogant society. Let us not forget the first film was produced by goof ball \"Eli Roth\". Let's also not forget that he came from a rich family from Newton, Massachusetts, born from a Doctor(his father) and lived the high life.Must be nice to have everything given to you on a \"silver platter\", I wish I was that little rich kid.The directors and producers once again just wanted to make money off of a film that is a horror rated version of girls gone wild.In this garbage version, sequel whatever you want to call it has great actors like Christopher Lloyd, Gary Busey, David Hasslhoff, which are all talented actors. Even with the Hoff's recent burger incident he is still a great actor. This film just makes them all look like they are trying to make a buck and not be who they can really be. I feel they are all better than this instead of selling themselves to a horrible accident of a film. This is the only thing horrifying in this film is the fact they tried to plug past great actors to sell the film.Pathetic.The original films were suppose to be taken seriously and not made into a half porno/horror film. This makes me angry, I love the original films, Piranha I&II. I didn't enjoy watching the out takes at the end with the whole idea of making it into some funny joke of a film from the past.(like American Pie)I challenge the real directors and producers out there to make a serious remake, telling the story of Piranha in an intelligent manner, not seeing it from an idiot version giving us a PG Titty rating, with no substance, no storyline.I want to see true science, true palaeontologists facts like the beginning of the first remake. With the prehistoric idea when Christopher Lloyd tells the story of the Piranha. I want to watch this film how it was when it first came out. I wish there was a remake with intelligence out there.Maybe somebody has a brain and uses it to actually make a remake, without turning it into a total Girls Gone Wild horrorfest.Well, in turn this second edition was more pathetic than the first remake. Cashing in on washed up actors. But I sincerely think they are not really washed up, I think that Hollycrap, Sorry I meant Hollywood has no way of producing actual intelligent films. Taking old school popular actors and making them act for this kind of garbage is the true pornographic material that this film represents.I say a -10 out of 10 for me.",

The first film from a few years ago was good because it parodied 80s horror films with over- the-top gore and unnecessary nudity. This one is written by the writers who wrote the worser Saw films. The camera work is terrible and obscures everything. There are too many close ups and unnecessary slow-motion and old classical music that achieves what? Humour to make the situation funny? Shock similar to what Reservoir Dogs did? I have no idea. The plot is barely there in the latter half with characters with no personalities. There are three returning actors from the first one, one is Christopher Lloyd playing a Doc Brown marine biologist and the other is Ving Rhames playing the Sheriff from the first film who is scared of water and the other is the second-assistant camera operator who was part of the porno-making crew from the first film. In the end, there is a cliffhanger that obviously will lead into a third film, which I will be surely missing. Piranha 3DD is tamer on gore, nudity, language and horror and doesn't even live up to the trailer or it's title. Funnily enough, the trailer for this film looked better than the original film. But the films in reality are the other way around. I would rather watch Jaws 3, one of the worst films in the world that Piranha 3DD in some ways steals plot from, than watch this sequel again. James Cameron, I'm sure your sequel from the 80s Piranha 2: The Spawning is a better sequel to the original than this sequel is to the 2009 remake. 5/10",

I mean, it had David Hasselhoff, Gary Busey, Clu Gulager, Christopher Lloyd, and Ving Rhames in the cast and was set at a water park, so how could they possibly screw this up? Enter PIRANHA 3DD.The prehistoric, carnivorous piranha from the first film have swam out of Lake Victoria and find themselves in a lake just outside of The Big Wet, a sleazy water park. The lecherous owner decides to use water from that lake for his water park to save money, and unwittingly unleashes the piranha on the patrons at the park. Can his step-daughter, her love interest, and even the Hoff himself put a stop to the ensuing carnage?PIRANHA 3DD should have been great. It should have been the best movie of the summer. But it wasn't. It was one of the biggest letdowns I have ever come across. But it wasn't ALL bad. The inclusion of the Hoff and Busey was entertaining in itself, even if Busey isn't really given anything to do. I mean, if you get Gary Busey to be in your film, why not make him, well, crazy, seeing as that's what he's known for? David Hasselhoff was easily the best part of the entire thing because of how hilarious he was. There's even a montage of him running in slow motion to save a ginger kid from the piranhas! Actually, all the events leading up to the big massacre at the water park were really unnecessary. You could have just shown the beginning and the end water park scene, and the whole thing would still make perfect sense.Probably the worst thing about it is how hard it's trying to replicate the original. Much like MEN IN BLACK II, it tries to be like the original by over-exploiting the good things about the first. The first was taken somewhat serious with an underlying humor, but here, there's absolutely no seriousness. There are a lot of dumb jokes that just do not work, and a lot of situations that are just trying way too hard to be funny instead of just being naturally humorous like the first.Even though the water park massacre was the best part of the movie, it was still a letdown! Remember how the first PIRANHA 3D actually had some funny and interesting death scenes? Not here. It's just piranhas nibbling on swimmers. That's it. Oh, and a piranha gets stuck between a guy's crack. That's the kind of humor we're dealing with in this movie. They could have done so much with the water park setting, and they waste it all.PIRANHA 3DD had some fun moments, but as a whole was pretty stale. It tries WAY too hard to replicate the original and be funny, and loses half the entertainment value along the way. This one might get better with future viewings, but right now, it's pretty moldy.I was never that big of a fan of the original, but now, I see that it could have been a whole lot worse",

I am a big fan of the French director of the first Piranha 3D, but I found myself enjoying the second one much more. The 3D photography is excellent, even better than John Carter. Lots of layering plus more attempts to have things jump out at the audience than we usually see in today's 3D. Especially good is the multiple close ups of fish trying to bite the viewers' faces off. The fish get more screen time in this version than any previous version of Piranha, much welcome to those of us who hate waiting until the end to see the monster. I don't understand why this is being given such a limited release; we had to drive 15 miles out of town into the desert to see it. This follows movies like Road Warrior and Superman 2, where the sequel makes big improvements on the original. The Hoff is hilarious too. Try to see this 3D tonight before it disappears and make sure you see it properly smogged.",

            "content": "These sort of films are supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, over acted, and trashy, the story plot full of stereo typed characters and bad decision making, along with good measures of tasteless gore and dark humour. Yet having all the right ingredients doesn't mean you can make a good cake. It takes a brilliance to balance these elements together and make something special, something marvelous. Director, Alexandre Aja, achieved this when he delivered Piranha 3D in 2010. Piranha 3DD does not. It feels like they've bought together a collection of not-so-funny one liners and cameo's and written a story around them, filling in any gaps with recycled material from the first film and Jaws 3D. (Certainly an interesting decision, given that Jaws 3-D was a horribly disappointing sequel itself).The production quality wasn't bad, and the sound was okay. The CGI and effects were a bit dodgy in places, but on the whole, passable. The real downfall for this film is the script. The dialogue starts a little wooden, but becomes increasingly worse as the film progresses and towards the end it's cringe worthy. The jokes are shockingly terrible, and I don't mean offensive, as in edgy or dark, they're just bad. The characters are two dimensional and dull with virtually no relationship building; it's difficult to care whether they live or die. Piranha 3DD is just sloppy (or lazy) writing. It's just a bunch of unexciting ideas that have been forced together to fill up 90 minutes. I never thought I'd say this, but by halfway through I was desperately hoping the piranha would sprout wings.The humour might appeal to some, and there's generous nudity throughout. Christopher Lloyd has some brief screen time and he is superb. It may be enjoyable with a group of guys over a few drinks and a stack of pizza, but I'd probably give it a miss and re-watch Piranha 3D instead.www.creaturewiththeatombrain.net",

            "content": "'PIRANHA 3DD': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) John Gulager (director of all three 'FEAST' films) directs this sequel to the hit 2010 remake 'PIRANHA 3D'. The original 1978 film was a horror/comedy (like it's remakes) and was directed by Joe Dante (It's sequel 'PIRANHA II: THE SPAWNING' was directed by none other than James Cameron). Both the original films were clever horror spoofs, the original remake (directed by Alexandre Aja) was as well. This sequel doesn't have nearly as much bite as the three films it follows despite the talent of Gulager. There are some decent gore scenes and a few good laughs but for the most part it falls a little flat.The film takes place a year after the events of the original remake and focuses on a water park re-opening in Lake Victoria under the management of Chet (David Koechner), who's adding an adult themed section to the park featuring strippers. This infuriates Chet's step-daughter Maddy (Dannielle Panabaker), a marine biology student who's returned home for the summer and co-owns the park. While trying to keep the water park legit Maddy runs in to a bunch of her old friends including Barry (Matt Bush), who's had a crush on her since grade school. At the same time two farmers (Gary Busey and Clu Galager) awake the swarm of prehistoric piranha, who have been nesting in a dead cow in a nearby lake. David Hasselhoff also shows up as a celebrity lifeguard at the park's grand re-opening.The film was written by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan (the team that wrote all three 'FEAST' films as well as the last four 'SAW' films) as well as another experienced B horror film writer and producer Joel Soisson. It has all the ingredients of a clever and entertaining slasher spoof (like the others) but doesn't come together quite right. It's not a bad film just not a very good one either. It's not nearly as fun as the 'FEAST' films or the other 'SAW' films but it does have Gulager's style and feel to it. There is plenty of monster movie mayhem and gore and a lot of nudity and sex as well for B movie fans. The laughs are few and far between but at times the film does deliver. Not a bad way to waste your time but it doesn't live up to the other films.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZarl-ByqEc",

            "content": "I loved the first Piranha! It was campy, schlocky, hilarious, gory, twisted and had an outstanding wild performance by Jerry O'Connell. So I was literally stoked to see a second go around. But they made some extremely bad mistakes going into this second one. First of all, the first film had the incredibly talented Alexander Aja behind the camera. The man is horror brilliance. This time they brought on John Gulager of Project Greenlight fame who only has the horror trilogy Feast under his belt. They cut the budget for this second one and they simply try way too hard to force a classic campy feel. It worked so well in the first one and it falls flat here. Its not a total write off, there are some truly great laughs...even if they are caused by being gratuitously violent or using blatant nudity to catch your attention. They do connect the film back to the first and even feature a couple of the original characters and I love that they did that for the fans. The build up to the actual piranha's wasn't nearly as intense as the first. It was as though they tried to force the humour and the horror together too quickly.Danielle Panabaker plays the lead in the film. I've always liked her a lot and she is the perfect scream queen for horror movies. She's smart and sweet and innocent, a Jamie Lee Curtis type scream queen. She holds her own in a sea of ridiculousness and piranhas. Matt Bush is her best friend and unrequited love interest. He is decent too and fun but he doesn't get enough screen time. David Koechner is okay as the perverted water park owner. He tries hard, maybe too hard, but I can't help but think he tries to re-create the amazingly campy and hilarious performance by Jerry O'Connell in the first and he doesn't hold a candle to that. David Hasselhoff plays himself in a campy self-deprecating performance that feels overdone and forced. It's always fun to watch a celebrity poke fun at himself but the Baywatch jokes were old ten years ago. Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames return from the first film in small cameos. Rhames is barely existent in the film but Lloyd is always fun especially in the expert type cameo role.I know that you can't just force a campy classic. It usually happens, I think, when a creative time is truly making something serious but it ends up being hilariously bad. I think they did manage to create a camp classic with the first one but the studio or producer left the sequel high and dry with a less than stellar budget and director. I did laugh a lot and there was some gapingly shocking moments that were outrageous. And of course there are plenty of the double D's mentioned in the title of the film. It isn't a classic but you can only expect so much given the concept and idea. 6/10",

Just watching the film trailer had me interested in the film, Hasslehoffs moobs flying about, added with a \"bring me ma legs\" from Ving Rhames, gave it a spoof like feel to it, mixed in with an adequate half original narrative structure made a good film to pass the time and laugh at with company.

Heck, most people in all honesty are below average dullards that will review a totally gratuitous schlock fest like this in the same way they would review a serious horror movie like JAWS. If you ever write \"none of the actors will receive any Oscars for their performance in this\", do the world a favor and don't write any more reviews. Why anybody would expect a movie with a title like PIRANHA 3DD to be nominated for any Oscars is beyond me. It's a movie about giant prehistoric killer fish attacking people at a water park and the title is a play on breast size for Pete's sake! Oscars... man! Gimme a break. However, if you like gory horror exploitation flicks filled with T&A, blood and guts, and characters that make you bust a rib in disbelief at their stupidity in tight situations then this is an absolute gem, even better than the first in terms of sheer exploitation and low brow humor. If you don't want any spoilers, stop reading here and enjoy the film. If you want to know some highlights to help determine if you think you'd have a ball watching stuff like this, then read on (and congratulations for not being a humorless waste of space). Highlights: the casting of Gary Busey and David Hasselhoff, both of whom have a blast with their deserved cult status/personas (fans of \"Baywatch\" will especially have a riot watching the Hoff poke fun at his alter ego, Mitch the lifeguard); gratuitous boobies (and lots of them!); a decapitated head flying through the air and landing on a pair of giant fun bags in post-mortem motorboat fashion; reeling in \"oh no\" fashion as a piranha spawns inside a bikini babe's stomach and exits via her nether region during coitus interruptus, clamping onto her lover's reproductive unit which gives him the bright idea to pull a Bobbit on himself right then and there; very cool (and nasty) looking fish and over the top but still honest to goodness gag inducing special effects; Ving Rhames getting over his fear of water and lack of legs which were chewed off in the first film; a completely out of the blue shot of a Piranha in a fat pervert's plummer's crack; a fast pace and perfect running time of under 90 minutes as all movies like this should be (there's no padding here... which is very good considering the DDs in the title). I watched this movie with 2 other people who were horrified and disgusted by the goings on AND who laughed their butts off the entire time. That's exactly what this movie was supposed to do and it succeeded in all departments. Definitely not for everybody, but a GREAT time for those who have a twisted sense of humor. 8.5 stars for what it is (fast paced jump and shout scares, gross-out gore, consciously clever sleazy perverted fun).

What sets this park aside from any others I've ever been to is the adult area, complete with the total nudity, droves of splash-happy double-D women and underwater cams. As well as the horny pool boy who likes to have sex with the underwater wall jets.Just as Richard Dreyfuss was the throwaway token star in the first Piranha remake, we now have Gary Busey, who really just seems to be playing himself. He and a friend wade out into a lake to retrieve a dead cow and it appears that the body is infested with piranha eggs and newly hatched piranha. After they are dispatched, the ravenous prehistoric fish kill a young couple after their van rolls into the lake. A few more random incidents occur and after a small piranha swims up inside a girl while skinny-dipping and then, ahem, latches itself onto a guy during sex, which results in him cutting the fish off by slicing off part of himself. (I'm not sure why he didn't just stab the fish so it lets go, but as I said earlier, it's complete trash and everyone is meant to be completely stupid). It's now apparent that the piranha are on the move again.A quick visit to Christopher Lloyd, who's now a YouTube sensation, and the gang are on the look out for piranha getting into the pipes. As usual the owner is having none of it and thanks to a crooked cop, any thought of shutting the park down is dismissed, so of course all hell breaks loose and fun slides run red as human is back on the piranha menu.David Hasselhoff is the guest celebrity, playing himself, playing his character from Bay Watch who is there to help open the park. He's basically made for this type of film as he's no actor, and as a comic relief is perfect for the tone of this flick.Ving Rhames also makes a comeback in this, now as a wheelchair bound aquaphobic. However when people start being eaten all around him, a pair of detachable titanium legs, complete with shotgun attachment, helps him overcome his fear in the best way possible.Really this is a junk film that turns out to be a lot of fun, which is pretty much like every other piranha film ever. The only difference in this is that there's a hell of a lot more nudity and more ridiculous, unrealistic death scenes than you can poke a severed penis at. Lots of half naked buxom women covered in fake blood running around mindlessly for the sheer sake of running around and the ending leaves us with the notion that this piranha franchise is going nowhere fast.

They actually tried to add too many boobs and gore in the movie, following the pattern of the first Piranha. In this one, you don't have tension. First scene about two men searching cow is ridiculous. Story was so rushed, that they thought it would excite us, audience. THey even added David Hasselhoff for comic tune. I was bored with his performance. It wasn't funny at all. Piranha 3D has more tension, action, darkness and piranha. In this one, everything is just a cheap parody. Yes, it doesn't take itself too seriously, but it isn't reason to make excuses why is this that bad and pretty much short.4/10",

The worst part of the movie is it's unimaginable and illogical screenplay (those who had seen the movie will relate with this).Acting is pathetic and cinematography is average. The movie mainly focuses more towards eroticism rather then working on the plot.Climax of the movie is pathetic. Please avoid the movie if you can.",

Beautifully filmed in 3D and utilizing that technique to its best advantage, this motion picture is really as much a black comedy as a horror film. From the opening sequence to its shattering climax, it is, however, a sensitively observed study in human nature under catastrophic circumstances while never letting up on the thrills and suspense. Returning cast members from previous Piranha entries give wonderful performances and some fresh faces are equally impressive. They all do well with a borderline brilliant script that pushes the envelope of horror while allowing for strong character development. Culager is unafraid and does not flinch from violence and gore but never uses these elements gratuitously. An intelligent and humorous horror film that does not fall into the notorious sequel trap, the genius of Piranha 3D is undeniable and the artists involved in its production deserve recognition.",

            "content": "In comparison to the 2010 remake starring Elizabeth Shue, this is a very different beast. That film was an earnest effort. For better or for worse, the 2010 Piranha, for all its flaws and moments of greatness, was a reasonably taut, thrilling story. You could play it with Lake Placid and Anaconda, and have a trio of aquatic monster flicks that took themselves reasonably seriously, and were all the better for it.But Piranha 3DD makes a seriously jarring tonal change into frat-boy, gross-out farce. I won't spoil any of the gags here for the sake of making my point, but man, are they ever base. No class at all. This is a YouTube 'funny' pranks video-with-horror that veers from moment to moment between trying to carry on the story of the 2010 remake, and being a 'Haw-haw! Ya spilled yer popcorn ya big dummy!' face-palmer. The surprise-star cameo opener that apes the clever Richard Dreyfus turn in the previous film here becomes a fart joke (literally), and what would have also been a cool David Hasselhoff cameo in the 2010 film is here a long, drawn-out squeezing of many old, old jokes. (The Hoff is still brilliant though). Happily, Christopher Lloyd returns to push the plot forwards a wee bit, and is just as brilliant as he is in everything he does.But perhaps nowhere is the confusing clash of directions in Piranha 3DD more evident than in the casting of Danielle Panabaker -- she's so good in all of her scenes that her very presence gives the lie to the film's real intentions. It's like watching an actor's performance in one film being CGI'd into something else entirely, and one can easily imagine that she was pitched this role as being something totally different to what was actually made around her. Ving Rhames, reprising his part from the previous film, also heavily gives the lie to the whole film, with his character being firmly shoved into the realm of comedy nonsense. And again, for those of you who enjoyed the 2010 Piranha, his characterisation here makes no sense.In short, although Piranha 3DD is billed as a \"horror comedy\", and although one really shouldn't be surprised by a film that uses a comedy bra size joke in its title, I personally found it to be a huge disappointment as a follow-up to the previous entry in the series, and a film that even in its own right is a confused, rambling mess.",

This follow-up to the 2010 movie is just honestly embarrassing. It had all the elements that the first movie had, but everything goes horribly wrong with incompetent direction, laughably bad acting and dialogue, and some of the cheapest gore effects I've ever seen.Why is this movie so bad? Let's start with the plot - there is none. If you can buy the premise that piranhas are going to go in underground lakes and somehow end up in a water park swimming, well then I have a bridge to sell you as well. The characters are all terrible. The one couple in the van early on exists only to die, no other purpose, no even attempted development. Yet later we see other characters mourning their disappearance, only it's forgotten 5 minutes later. The one scene that people will probably remember involves a girl that had a piranha swim up her lady parts (and somehow survive) only to bite her boyfriend's penis during intercourse. Trying to be inventive there, but really just shows the lack of any restraint with this movie. But even if you think the plot and acting are atrocious, at least there will be good gore, right? Wrong. The gore effects can be described in one word: cheap. The special effects with the piranhas are terrible too - you wonder where they spent $20 million on this movie. Not to mention, the inevitable massacre scene is shot so poorly that it has zero coherence and lacks any punch. It looks like they just poured some red dye in the pool and hired a few extras to flop around. The massacre scene in the first film had some of the best gore effects I'd ever seen. This is a joke of a follow-up.So which actors disgraced themselves for a paycheck? There is a cameo by David Hasselhoff where he's basically mocking himself, but you have to wonder what is going through his head when his character mutters \"Welcome to rock bottom.\" I wonder if the irony is lost on this man. David Koechner is just obnoxious and terrible. Jerry O'Connell played this type of character way better in the first film. Every time Koechner was on screen, I was just wanting him to get killed off already.And also surprisingly, we don't even get any good nudity. All the extras they hired for this movie look like washed up strippers. None of the cute female leads goes topless. Maybe they ran out of budget and couldn't pay them enough to do it.I have a feeling that 95% of the people involved in this film will ever have meaningful work in Hollywood again (thankfully).

Me and my friends had watch this movie and they felt like the death scenes felt like Final destination (exagerated deaths). now for the positives, Danielle Panabaker was great as the lead, Melton and Dunstan had a great idea of a water park being attacked by the school of bad ass piranhas, speaking of piranhas, they looked pretty good in this movie, i had to say, better than the first. The \"dentata\" scene made us laugh out loud, but wait, why didn't Shelby feel the fish inside her uterus? lastly, The Hoff was brilliant at playing a Parody of himself being an ass and all.

Almost every girl in this movie has her boobs out, and I began to get the feeling it was written by a couple of 12 year old boys.

            "content": "What is there to say about Piranha 3DD that isn't immediately obvious from the title and the trailer?Oh, the original in this series of remakes was stupid, bloody, produced the occasional jump and was lot's of fun, so I approached the sequel to 2010's Piranha with expectations of a diluted version containing a few more tits, more gore and a smidgen of horror. What I got was a lot more tits, more gore, a poor attempt at horror and David Hasselhoff, who probably constitutes all three.The plot, such as it is, has the flesh-eating fish setting up camp in a refurbished water park that is about to be opened by Chet (David Koechner) the crass, stupid and almost villainous stepfather of our goody-two-shoes heroine, Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), who is constantly reminded \"You look like Elizabeth Shue\" a not very subtle reference to the star of the first outing. The fish have lunch, naked, semi-naked and trying-to-get-naked people die and then The Hoff & Ving Rhames (with legs stolen from Planet Terror) turn up to help.Koechner hams it up, Panabaer struggles to muster anything resembling acting ability (and has an awful lot of company in that regard), The Hoff sends himself up (very badly) and all are utterly dwarfed by the might of Christopher Lloyd, reprising his role as Carl Goodman, who purports to be the fishy expert but is actually just the coked-up-to-the-eyeballs secret brother of Doc Emmett Brown. The instinct is to ask \"What the heck is Lloyd doing in a film like this?\" but I'm guessing the obvious answer is \"Taking a fat paycheck for two days work and having a blast in the process.\"It was probably a great deal more fun making Piranha 3DD than it was watching it.The verdict in one word: Shocking!The CGI fish are unbelievably awful, the acting is almost without exception the visual equivalent of Dick Van Dyke's accent in Mary Poppins, the plot is as complex and involving as Paris Hilton and the laughs are rare and under developed.The scripting is so awful it's almost good but it angers me that, while many writers have fine scripts they're unable to put in the right hands, somebody well-connected (hands up, Patrick Melton et al) was paid good money to write crap like this:\"Do you think Ashley's better looking than me?\" \"No. I've never really been into girls with big breasts.\"Or\u0085 \"Hey, what is it?\" \"It's the stress of the whole Ashley thing. Make love to me? Please?\" \"Right now?\" \"Please, Josh. Right now. I think something's really wrong with me and if I don't get better, I don't want to die a virgin.\"Or, and this is the finest line of the film (and possibly the year)\u0085\"Josh cut off his penis because something came out my vagina.\" Oh, there's absolutely no point in discussing the flaws and merits of this. It's crap and almost fabulous because of it. No, you're right; it's just crap.That said, it does have the best exploding fart I've seen on film for a while.Come February 2013, I think it's highly likely you'll see Piranha 3DD featuring quite prominently at the Razzies aka The Golden Raspberries (the antitheses of the Oscars and an institute of which I'm desperate to gain membership), which is a great deal more success than it deserves.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk",

Basically the same plot as the first film. Without Kelly Brook. One by one our heroic teens are subjected to brutal attacks by these violent Piranhas, and its up to Maddy, conveniently a marine biologist who's step-father owns the water park, to save the day somehow. Whereas the first film worked as a spoof of 1970's B-Movie horror films, this film just feels lazy, the jokes are half-hearted and there's nothing original in terms of the gore, it plays out like a standard horror film (although there is one crazy castration scene which will both terrify and amuse you). What manages to slightly redeem the film are the celebrity cameos that come during the later stages of the film, we have Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future man) return as a nutty scientist, and David Hasselhoff playing a parody of himself (is he bankrupt or something?).The film begins with a 2 minute montage of 3d breasts and ends with a 20 minute gore-fest involving numerous naked women, so its clear this is a film for males aged 18-25 (probably), but i wouldn't rush to the cinema to see this, or buy the DVD, just wait for it on TV. 4/10",

But in the case of \"Piranha 3DD,\" that's an actual line of dialogue. Perhaps it's a good thing that it's not only aware of horror movie clich\u00e9s but actually wants to rub them in our faces until we pass out from the smell. We know that this is a bad movie, and the filmmakers know that we know and beat us at our own game. Having said that, there does come a point at which self-awareness devolves into a very unflattering form of monomania. And if you're not careful, it will eventually mutate into sickening self indulgence. If you need proof, here's another line, one that's sure to kick start your imaginations: \"He cut off his penis because something came out of my vagina!\"The film is, of course, a sequel to 2010's \"Piranha 3D,\" a remake of Joe Dante's 1978 film. That movie merely went over the top. \"Piranha 3DD\" goes over, around, and through, like an alcoholic on a self-destructive bender towards blessed oblivion. Watching it, I honestly didn't know whether to admire its shamelessness or curse the day it was conceived of. Mindless trash is one thing. But when you include a scene in which sex is interrupted because a piranha hatches in the woman's body, swims out her vagina, and clamps its jaws onto the man's genitals, spraying the bed and the walls with blood, well, that might be taking things one step too far. Its status as pure, unadulterated exploitation is underlined by the title, which is not \"3-D-D\" but \"3-Double-D.\" If you don't get the reference, then quite frankly, you don't deserve to have it explained to you.It has been a year since the events of the first film, during which a species of prehistoric piranha thought to be extinct broke free from an underwater cave, swam en masse to the shores of Lake Victoria, and savagely dined on the horny teenagers celebrating Spring Break. The once thriving community was thrown into economic ruin and became a ghost town. The voice-over narration of a news reporter wonders if such a thing could ever happen again. And so it comes to pass that, at a lake somewhere in the middle of Arizona, two rednecks played by Gary Busy and Clu Gulager meet their untimely ends when their prize heifer, which floats lifelessly in the water, farts out a series of piranha eggs that immediately hatch. Cut to a television ad for a nearby water park, which will open in two days with promises of hot young women and a lot of double entendres consisting of the word \"wet.\"The park is 51% owned by an unscrupulous and perverted showman named Chet (David Koechner). The remaining 49% is owned by his stepdaughter, Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), who has just returned home after studying marine biology in college. Needless to say, they don't see eye to eye on Chet's decision to replace genuine lifeguards with big-breasted strippers and corner off a section of the park for nude swimming. She reunites with her junior high pal, the mousy but decent Barry (Matt Bush), and her ex-boyfriend, a corrupt and arrogant deputy cop named Kyle (Chris Zylka). As they compete for Maddy's affections, we cut to several scenes where one-dimensional teenage typecasts get devoured by the newly spawned piranha. Two of them are in a van about to have sex \u2013 although they must pray first, as they are about to commit a sin. One of them releases the parking break, allowing the van to roll into the lake. You can take it from there.These recent deaths catch Maddy's attention, leading her, Barry, and Kyle to seek out the eccentric piranha expert Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd). He informs them, as only he can, that this particular species of piranha probably traveled from Lake Victoria via several underground lakes, that they can bite their way through corrugated steel, and that they could conceivably travel through pipes, as chlorinated water is somehow or another similar to the water they originated from. With horror, Maddy realizes that the water park drains directly into the neighboring lake. She tries to warn Chet, who opens the park anyway. It isn't long before a school of piranhas do in fact swim up a pipe to the water park, bite their way through a pool grate, and do what they do best \u2013 including decapitating a boy no older than ten.Did I forget to mention that this movie is in 3D? Director John Gulager (Clu's son) takes no half measures in ensuring that the audience is aware of it; in the course of this film, we will see a bloody stump of an arm, spikes of coral, a trident, and jiggling slow-motion breasts assaulting our field of vision, along with several snapping piranhas. Did I also forget to mention the special guest appearances by Ving Rhames and David Hasselhoff? The former plays the same character he played in the previous film, minus his legs. He is, however, fitted with prosthetics, one doubling as a shotgun. The latter plays a parody of himself, begging the question of whether he accepted this job for fun or out of desperation. \"Piranha 3DD\" is what it is, but unlike its predecessor, that isn't a sign that it succeeded. Having said that, you might have fun during the end credits, at which point we're shown nearly ten minutes worth of outtakes.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",

The slasher/monster clich\u00e9s of young, attractive people getting brutally killed on screen is nothing new to the genre and Piranha 3dd takes it to a higher level. No story to speak of, average acting, comical special effects are abound. I said comical but actually the gore scenes and the piranhas are very well done, and the gore is so over the top you can't do much but smirk at the massacre you watch. The people who rated this movie low clearly either walked in the wrong cinema or very different expectations from a movie titled Piranha 3dd. But if you watch it knowing full that there will be about boobs and killer piranhas, you will no doubt have loads of fun. Some nice cameos by David Hasselhoff and Christopher Lloyd are nice gifts also.

The worst thing had to be Hasselhoff - can you beat a dead horse anymore with the invoke they were trying to make with him. Beyond Stupid! And finally the bloopers at end may have been longer than the actual movie - did they run out of cash?

            "content": "In 2010 Piranha 3D, made on an estimated budget of $24 million, went on to gross over $83 million worldwide. The movie was far from good, but was able to succeed by not taking itself seriously and upping the \"camp\" factor. It shouldn't be a surprise, based on the film's gross, that a sequel would be spawned; the aptly named Piranha 3DD.When last we saw the prehistoric piranha they were wrecking havoc on Lake Victoria's Spring party. As predicted by Carl Goodman, played by Christopher Lloyd, the piranha have begun to evolve and are now able to breakthrough steel, metal, and wood to get to their next meal. That next meal, or appetizer is to be found in a nearby lake, and ends with the ravenous, toothy fish finding their main course in a water park, which includes a newly constructed \"adults only\" section called \"Big Wet\" that employs \"water-certified strippers\" and where \"double Ds get in for free\"; and there are plenty of double Ds (here lies the reason for the movie's title).At an estimated budget of $20 million, Piranha 3DD is the most expensive film directed by John Gulager, known mostly for being the Project Greenlight: season 3 winner and director of the Feast trilogy. Based on what Gulager's Piranha 3DD, having never seen any of his Feast films, his style of film making appears to be one in which he favors style over substance. He would seem to be someone who could make a very decent living directing films to be seen on the Syfy network.The only returning cast from the original are Christopher Lloyd's Goodman and Ving Rhames' Deputy Fallon; when we last saw Fallon he appeared to be getting eaten alive from the waste down. We learn that in fact he wasn't killed and was rendered legless; however, he was able to save enough money for replacements. Gary Busy also makes an appearance, albeit a short one.The lead actress is Danielle Panabaker (Shark), starring as Mandy, 49% owner of \"Big Wet\" and marine biology (!?!?) student. Panabaker's Mandy is the least campy of the characters, and unfortunately there's nothing to take seriously in the film and for that she's the least memorable.Matt Bush's (Glory Daze) Barry is the dorky guy and basically the park's glorified trash man\u0085.and seemingly useless when it comes to anything else, because he can't swim. Bush has the look of the dork down pat, and provides some very funny moments.David Koechner, who has played in some very funny comedies such as Anchorman, The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard, and Semi-Pro, is the perfect choice to play the park's majority owner and Mandy's step-father Chet. Koechner has a way about him that is perfectly suited for a film and role of this stature.David Hasselhoff plays himself and steals the film with his self mockery; it's not a far cry from the truth when Hasselhoff mutters the line that he's \"hit rock bottom\".I'd be remiss if I didn't give kudos to Katrina Bowden, who plays Shelby, and Jean-Luc Bilodeau, who plays Josh; the duo have one of the best scenes in the film and Bowden easily delivers the film's funniest line.As much as Piranha 3D didn't take itself seriously, it was more than just big chests, gore and comedic moments; it had a storyline to aid in guiding the film along. In Piranha 3DD it's all just big chests, over the top gore, and comedic moments. That's not to say that it's a bad thing, because the film doesn't try to be anything more than what it is; a lot of cheese and double Ds.Grade: BVisit our site at www.twodudereview.com",

Now here comes PIRANHA 3DD (no, that \"3DD\" is not a typo error), a follow-up that I bet a lot of those who've watched the remake, are naturally expecting something \"bigger\" or \"more outrageous\". Heck, even this sequel has been heavily promoted with the self-proclaimed tagline of \"Double the action. Double the terror. Double the D's\". However, PIRANHA 3DD fails to live up its \"double the (insert the pun)\" promise and instead delivers more of the same without the technical expertise that Aja has fashioned rather well in his remake. This time, there's no Aja in sight here as the sequel is replaced by FEAST director John Gulager. And Gulager is no Aja. What you get here instead is a cheap and uninspired follow-up that makes Aja's PIRANHA looks like a genre classic...Read more at http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2012/05/piranha-3dd-2012.html",

            "content": "It has to be said- Piranha 3DD is probably the most overrated sequel ever put to film. In fact it is suggestible that Piranha 3DD steals crown from 2010's remake as most overrated summer blockbuster of the 21st century. Maybe its the fact that the studio kept yo-yoing around with release dates or the ratings board making a dogs dinner out of getting it out there, but 3DD definitely held peoples attention in the LOOOONG time it took to get it off the ground and into theaters. This time around instead of artsy French director Alexandra Aja we have gore maestro John Gulager (Feast) in the directors chair and a team of Saw sequel writers drafted in to write the script. Scream queen Danielle Panabaker takes over from Shue as the protagonist and Rhames returns along with Christopher Lloyd and David Hasselhoff (?) for blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos. The storyline is dumb. Even more dumb than that of the first which told us that fresh water fish have been living in secret underwater caves for millions. This time we are told that the said fish have worked out how to travel through underground sewage systems and into drains and that is exactly what happens. Instead of the lake we have a water park setting called \"Big Wet\" This has to be the most unrealistic water park in the world because the life guards are pole dancers (hence the 3DD joke in the title) Panabaker plays Maddy a marine biologist (oh what a surprise) who has returned to her home town for the summer. Apparently she owns the water park along with her Stepfather who is trying to restore tourism in the town (we are told that the events of Piranha 3D had an adverse effect on the popularity of the lake- are you surprised? no me neither.) Anyways after a few people go missing Maddy suspects that something is wrong and does some nose-poking. Cue piranha-in-your-face scene and soon Maddy comes to the realization that...wait for it...THE PIRANHA ARE BACK! If that isn't bad enough, a creepy Christopher Lloyd calls to inform Maddy that this time the Piranha can travel underground through sewage pipes and will soon work their way into the water park (I'm seriously not making this up) Anyways we soon learn than people have been illegally tampering with the pipes that connect the water park to the lake (how ironic I hear you ask...well blame the writers they came up with this genius idea) and that by the time Maddy gets to the water park the fish carnage has already begun. Here The Hoff makes an appearance and delivers some good satire and he soon gets involved in the chaos though and sort of becomes an anti-hero. Rhames, scarred from his last encounter with the piranha goes all Samuel L Jackson-kick ass but you've already seen the famous hyped up leg rifle scene countless times in the trailers \"bring me my legs!\" so it doesn't really come as a surprise. Rhames is underused here and the scene is pretty mediocre. The funniest scenes takes place no where near the water. Katrina Bowden and Jean-Luc Bilodeau are having sex and a piranha jumps out of her vagina and bites his manhood off (no I'm not making it up this really happens.) Later on in the film Bowden is reminiscent of the event \"Something came out of my vagina and bit Josh's penis off.\" This is probably the funniest scene in the whole film but again most of it was featured in the trailer so you already know what is going to happen which is disappointing. Still that one liner had me in stitches.Anyways there are a few gross out gags thrown in and more nudity than you can shake a stick at. The action scenes are great and the piranha look slightly less ropey however the gore is trimmed and diluted (which is disappointing) Panabaker is a decent actress but she is hard to take seriously as a marine biologist/business woman AND heroine. She is expected to carry a film when in reality she is just a moderately good B movie actress. Shue managed to carry Piranha due to her experience as a well respected actress. Panabaker seems uncomfortable and edgy trying to fill those shoes. Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd reprise their roles but between them they probably clock around 60 seconds screen time. More time is given to the Hoff who steals the show entirely but the gimmick is short lived. The rest of the cast scream, splash, get naked and get eaten and there are no stand out performances. It is the writers however who should be hanging their heads with this one. The reason Piranha was so fun was because it didn't take itself seriously. Aja even got Richard Dreyfus to laugh at himself and the seriousness surrounding his Jaws fame, however Piranha 3DD is so aware of the success of the first film that it tries too hard to look good. It's an arrogant film that tries to be better than the original but ultimately falls flat due to too much time spent on trying to make an impossible storyline possible. The acting is pretty atrocious and Gulager seems to have lost his touch. The special effects are still a bit \"meh\" The ending is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen in the theater. A couple of people shook their head and said \"yeah right.\" You'll see what I mean. The ending also opens up the door for a second sequel (if they follow the storyline with what happens right at the very end of this then the third Piranha film will be a complete disaster.)By all means go and see it. I know your curiosity will lead you there. Just don't expect anything other than mediocre.",

Almost everything in this movie is good enough but due to a very bad storyline, this movie is something to waste your time a.k.a money. The movie starts with a good introduction and later as it progress, more and more craps are showing up. A lot of things that doesn't make any sense being put in this movie. There is a time when the piranha shows cannibalistic act but this is nonsense. If they are cannibalistic, they wouldn't be around since they'll keep eating their own mate. The ending was ridiculous. I couldn't understand how that fat ass makes the pipe blown. He didn't use any explosive but instead he just pour some petrol inside the piping system and he use his cigarette to start the fire which somehow creates explosion. I know that a good movie doesn't has to be realistic a follows physic of the real world but that doesn't mean it has to be too ridiculous to be true. As a conclusion, don't pay a penny to watch this, even David Hasselhoff can't save this abomination. --> Additional note: Do watch this if you could think this movie as a comedy like Scary Movie.",

            "content": "I went to the theater to see the first 3D Piranha movie after critics and fans raved about it being so senselessly ridiculous and gory, blah blah blah. That movie sucked. It was boring, not gory, the 3D sucked, and I felt totally ripped off. Hell, I enjoyed Piranha 2 by James Cameron more and in that film, Roger Corman made him use stock footage of angel fish to be the supposed flesh eating fish. So this time I avoided the theater, the 3D prices (which I can tell from watching would still be a rip-off as there are only a handful of real 3D shots in the film and the rest is converted crapola), and just watched it on VOD. And I gotta say, this is what the first one should have been. It's shlocky. There is tons of gore. It does mimic the first film with a few things - a surprise ending; a guest star death at the first scene. But this has gorgeous women with big boobs. Some truly hilarious kills. It's one of those so bad it's good movies. And the director, who did FEAST, delivers another great B-movie. I like Alexander Aja just fine (save Mirrors and I think Haute Tension, while nicely gory, made zero sense with its surprise ending), but he and his cast were lame in the first 3D movie. This one never takes itself even remotely seriously for a moment. And the Hoff is great in his self- deprecating cameos. My only complaint would be Christopher Lloyd, who was once a great comic actor. In both films he just goes way too over the top. Is he now a real alcoholic like he used to play on Taxi or has he simply forgotten how to act?Otherwise, if you like hot chicks, nice tits and minge, and lots of blood, see it on video. DO NOT WASTE THE MONEY ON A 3D theater screening - the 3D will suck again.",

            "content": "First off, I didn't think the first one was great either (but 3 1/2 stars, sure.) but this one's got nothing on #1's plot. The tension, and I guess a scare or two, but there is no ending set piece complete the film. The first one had the kids stranded and whats-her-name trapped in the boat. This film has none of that. The filmmakers understand the b-style, but when your monsters stay under the water for the most part, your people should be stuck in the water! The climax should have had someone trapped- like maybe on one of those water park lifeguard islands, like the ones in the middle of the pool, when you see the film you'll understand how that would work well! But for some reason: No. Other than that there are some great celeb cameos, humor and action to pass the time, but I guess that's not what people were expecting from this film. It's not bad though. I laughed, and had some fun- so I'm thinking the crazy low rating (3.8?? That's lower than those Syfy channel movies!) is because Piranha 3DD is goofy, not scary, and such a change in mood, story, and humor. People where expecting Piranha 2, they got scary movie 6. And apparently nobody wanted them to go comedy. And in some ways comedy doesn't work for this film, e.i. the first film wanted you to be impressed/entertained by the effects and the scares, and these type of comedy are basically making fun of them selves, so the film doesn't let you admire it's talent. Piranha 3DD is fun, and deserves much better than what it's gotten, but goes to show that spoofs and horror flicks don't mix well.P.S. This film actually did okay over seas, and some of the behind-the-camera crew are interested, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Piranha: Part 3D (The third Piranha movie- hoping it might happen!)",

All kinds of hilarious high jinks ensue. If this kind of humor appeals to you then by all means rent the DVD. Your chances of finding this movie in an actual theater are nil. I am surprised it ever got made since the first one did not make that much money. Double D made even less. So do not expect a third installment. The first movie is far superior with a good cast headed by Elisabeth Shue & Jerry O'Connell. Mister O'Connell steals the show as a sleazy Hugh Hefner type. The piranhas make sure he gets what he deserves by the end of the movie. Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames return for the sequel but Mr. Rhames is uncredited which usually means he just wants the paycheck but does not want this turkey on his resume. David Hasselhoff is just plain embarrassing playing \"himself\". The bare breasts in the sequel are greatly multiplied from the original.

The first one, I enjoyed because it was campy, had loads of awesome gore and death, and a lot of pointless and beautiful nudity. So any more of that had me signed up. But it seems like the producers lost sight of what made the first movie so great, because it shows in \"Piranha 3DD\".So the plot of \"Piranha 3DD\" is as simple as its predecessor. It's been a year since the first movie, everyone knows now that there are a species of prehistoric piranhas running lose, and now they've invaded a water park. From there, we have our movie. Or at least the last half an hour. Aside from a few great moments, until the piranhas get into the water park, nothing really happens in the movie. It's just a few good one-liners and one or two hilarious deaths.There are only three characters worth mentioning in this entire film. The first of which is Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Goodman. He is just great. In the first movie, I was really disappointed he had such a boring role, but now, he is developed into comic gold. The whole scene he's in, you can't help but be transfixed on him. You're gonna be laughing through all the plot points in this scene, but let's be honest, you didn't watch this movie for the plot.Ving Rhames is also back as Deputy Fallon. I don't care what your movie is about, if you need a badass black actor, just get Ving Rhames to swear and shoot and he immediately makes your movie awesome. Again, his one scene is just great. You will die laughing to see what Fallon has been reduced to in this movie, and then as you saw in the trailer, shogun legs. Enough said.And finally, David Hasselhoff, my favourite aspect of this movie. He plays himself in this movie, and it seems like he meant this to apply to real life, but there's a scene where he goes to the water park's grand opening and he says to himself \"So this is rock bottom\". And right there I was like, \"well at least he can admit it, unlike some people\". Hasselhoff has some of the most priceless lines in this movie. If for nothing else, I say watch this movie just for him. He makes it.The only negative about this movie is that it seems they tried to mainstream the film into a horror, with only a few comedic moments, whereas in the first movie, there were tons of comedic elements sprinkled throughout. It just felt like they were actually going for scares this time instead of mocking the scares.It's not as good as the first one, but \"Piranha 3DD\" is still a really fun time. I personally watched it with three chicks, at their request, and had a great time. Because I'm that awesome. I say get this movie for Hasselhoff alone, but don't buy it for more than $15 max. Gore, Boobs, and Hilarity. Always a good time",

If you can buy the premise that piranhas are going to go in underground lakes and somehow end up in a water park swimming, well then I have a bridge to sell you as well. The characters are all terrible. The one couple in the van early on exists only to die, no other purpose, no even attempted development. Yet later we see other characters mourning their disappearance, only it's forgotten 5 minutes later. The one scene that people will probably remember involves a girl that had a piranha swim up her lady parts (and somehow survive) only to bite her boyfriend's penis during intercourse. Trying to be inventive there, but really just shows the lack of any restraint with this movie. But even if you think the plot and acting are atrocious, at least there will be good gore, right? Wrong. The gore effects can be described in one word: cheap. The special effects with the piranhas are terrible too - you wonder where they spent $20 million on this movie. Not to mention, the inevitable massacre scene is shot so poorly that it has zero coherence and lacks any punch. It looks like they just poured some red dye in the pool and hired a few extras to flop around. The massacre scene in the first film had some of the best gore effects I'd ever seen. This is a joke of a follow-up.\n\nSo which actors disgraced themselves for a paycheck? There is a cameo by David Hasselhoff where he's basically mocking himself, but you have to wonder what is going through his head when his character mutters \"Welcome to rock bottom.\" I wonder if the irony is lost on this man. David Koechner is just obnoxious and terrible. Jerry O'Connell played this type of character way better in the first film. Every time Koechner was on screen, I was just wanting him to get killed off already.\n\nAnd also surprisingly, we don't even get any good nudity. All the extras they hired for this movie look like washed up strippers. None of the cute female leads goes topless. Maybe they ran out of budget and couldn't pay them enough to do it.\n\nI have a feeling that 95% of the people involved in this film will ever have meaningful work in Hollywood again (thankfully). Don't waste your time.",

            "content": "Piranha 3DD is an ok sequel to the superior 2010 gorefest remake of Joe Dante's classic of the same name. Its not the best due to the film's problems and issues which resulted with a bad execution and when compared to its mighty predecessor this film is no match against its super bloody predecessor. This film takes place two years after the events of the first film. Its been two years after the massacre at Lake Victoria when the Piranhas attacked a lot of party goers. Lake Victoria is now abandoned and quarantined after a lot of people where injured and killed in the incident. When Maddy a young lady who owns a water park returns home for the summer after College in studying Marine biology where she reunites with her friends and ex boyfriend who is now a police officer. She finds out that her stepfather took over as the owner of the park and has renew the entire water park with lifeguard water strippers along with a celebrity life guard and has also made a new adult theme water park on the other side which Maddy does not like despite her objections against her step father. Soon the Piranhas are now back and this time they are going to create further bloodshed in the newly themed adult water park on the day of its opening as they travel through the pipes leading to the park. It is now up to Maddy and her friends to prevent the bloodshed from happening and they must find a way to deal with the situation before the same incident happens again just like with Lake Victoria. Ok when I first heard that there was a sequel already to the 2010 gorefest in development I was hoping to see what  the filmmakers can do next for the sequel either it will surpass its predecessor and will be more successful than the first film or it will stay in the same line as its predecessor and will be just as successful as its predecessor. The result is neither. Its a total bummer. This sequel seriously became a total bummer as it goes down the drain quickly from the beginning until the end. When I saw the trailers for this movie it looks like it will be just like the first one but I notice some problems when they showed the promos. It looked like the movie was gonna be more of a Direct to DVD movie or a Made for TV movie for the Syfy channel. That's when I suddenly found out that there was a problem already with this sequel right when the negative reviews started coming and it flopped at the box office at the same time back in 2012. When I had the chance to watch it. It is an epic fail and total bummer. I knew that when I watched this film there was already a problem after an interesting moment in the first half and guess what. The film is problematic and it goes down the drain as you can expect. This is a disappointing sequel that's trying its best to stay true to the spirit of its successful gore threshing predecessor. But at least it is still a bit enjoyable to me aside from having loads of issues that made me completely disappointed. One of the things I did not like about this movie is the way it was executed. Since the first film was more of a homage to Steven Spielberg's Jaws and it is super bloody and has less humor. This one puts the humor up in the worst possible way and oh my goodness! The film looked more of a spoof other than a Horror movie. I could not believe that this film ended up being extremely bad in the execution and it really looked like a spoof just like Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. But where Freddy's Dead was so awful due to its annoying and pure awful moments from the beginning until the end and it destroyed the Nightmare On Elm Street movies. Piranha 3DD at least worked a bit more but it is still disappointing and bad nowhere as bad as Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare but at least its just an average or ok film to watch if you're bored. The other problem with this movie is that this film suffers from a lot of pacing issues from start to finish. The movie is packed with loads of slow and dull moments that seriously ruined the entire film and don't expect anything good happening in several scenes after the first half of the film so there's nothing special later on in the next half of the movie until the end. One of the other issues with this movie is the bad soundtrack. If the first film had lots of pump dance party songs this sequel is packed with loads of awful songs that did not fit well in the movie plus the film is also packed with loads of awful CGI effects. It felt as if the Syfy channel worked on the movie and instead of releasing it in cinemas they just released this film straight to video or air it as a Made for TV film owned by them. What else is bad about this movie. Oh yes there's also two more issues with this film. The worst thing about this sequel is budget being lower than the first film. No wonder that this sequel received bad reviews due to the lower budget and straight to video look it really could have been better. But the worst part about this movie is the gore. I cannot believe what I just saw with my two eyes. The gore in this movie looks so cheesy and fake looking(just check out the scene where all the people in the water park are getting eaten by the Piranhas and the way they die along with several characters the gore in those scenes are so not good even the deaths were stupid and cheesy looking) because in the first film you get to see loads of over the top gore and graphic scenes like close ups of the Piranhas eating towards every person's flesh and a shocking and super disgusting sequence where a girl's hair gets caught in a boat propeller and the top of her head gets ripped off in a violent and gruesome way here the gore looks so tame and fake looking combined with some horrible CGI Piranhas and its a big shame that the CGI here were so awful since the first film had lots of incredible CGI Piranhas here the Piranhas looked so fake and very Syfy looking. Worst comes to worst the film also suffers from poor 3D effects that almost ruined the movie. Seriously there are only two amazing 3D scenes in this film(The scary Piranhas leaping towards the screen and the opening titles leaping on the screen) the rest are lame and so dull looking. Ok there are only a few things I like about this movie. The first is a few good scenes in the first half(The opening scene where two farmers one is portrayed by Nightmare On Elm Street 2 actor Clu Gulager getting eaten alive by Piranhas and the other two scenes where two girls are attacked by the Piranhas in the lake but were able to survive along with the intense sequence where the first two victims in the yellow van are eaten by the Piranhas first before the dull and lame climax oh and I forgot to mention the fun Nightmare On Elm Street bath tub scene) the second is the incredible editing and the third is a few funny scenes that were way better than the other scenes in the film. Now the acting gave me a mixed feeling. Some of the casts were ok with their performances in this film. While I like seeing the three actors like Paul Scheer reprise his role as the cameraman from the first film along with Ving Rhames reprising his role as the deputy who luckily survived the events from the first film and he was so funny in this movie, I love the super funny scene where he throws the cameraman in the pool and last but not least I seriously love Christopher Lloyd reprising his role as the Emmett \"Doc\" Brown like scientist in this film and he is way funnier and more over the top in this movie than in the previous film(\"Take that Laughing Diarrhea Baby\"). Ok out of all the new casts only Danielle Panabaker delivers an outstanding performance in this film and she is pure gorgeous and so grown up after her film debut with Sky High along with Nightmare On Elm Street 2 actor Clu Gulager even though he was killed and eaten by the Piranhas in the beginning of the film while David Hasselhoff has a fun cameo in this movie despite that he is too old already yet he is still funny in this film. The rest of the casts were bad and just plain awful and I did not like David Koechner as the annoying stepfather of Maddy and he was just awful in this film along with Chris Zylka(who is well known for his performance in The Amazing Spider Man as Flash Thompson the bully who always makes fun of Peter Parker) as the corrupt police officer and ex boyfriend of Maddy only two of the new casts did a good job with their performances in this movie the rest were really bad. Director John Gulager seriously didn't have a clue when he was gonna make this movie. I don't think he understood the formula of what made the first movie famous and from what I can tell since I read that Joel Soisson was brought in to produce and re write the script written by Saw IV-VII writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan I knew that the film was gonna be in a bad direction. And this film seriously felt as if John Gulager doesn't know how he will make the film work and so he quit and left the project and Joel Soisson took directing duties from Gulager and it also felt as if he also brought in Freddy Got Fingered actor and director Tom Green and together they both rewrote the script by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan and they made the movie look really bad by adding so many scenes that are not funny or makes no sense at all.  I can't believe that neither Pete Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg and Alexandre Aja and Gregory Levasseur(the team behind the successful 2010 gorefest predecessor) had any involvement in making this film. I would truly appreciate this movie if it had a better director like Chuck Russel(who was originally set to direct the previous film and made some uncredited rewrites in Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg's screenplay) direct the sequel and at least have James Wan and Leigh Whannell(the guys behind the Insidious movies) write the sequel along with some rewrites from Chuck Russell's collaborator Frank Darabont(A Nightmare On Elm Street 3; Dream Warriors script writer) work on rewriting the script for the sequel I would truly appreciate this film if they at least hired these guys to make the movie work as its predecessor. Overall Piranha 3DD is a disappointing and bland sequel that fails to capture the spirit of its successful blood shed predecessor. But at least it is watchable for me if I'm a bit bored just to kill some time. This movie gets a 5.5/10. If you're bored and you have nothing better to do just keep your brain calm and watch this film and of course enjoy it.",

Rhames and Lloyd return, with David Koechner as a sleazy water park owner (basically if Champ Kind owned a water park) the opening cameo spot taken by a suitably insane Gary Busey. The rest of the cast is made up of not particularly likable good looking youngsters, the most recognisable being 'her out of Tucker and Dale'. \n\nIt's a predictable retread of its predecessor and neither as funny or as fun as last time out. It's not quite as bad as, say Sharknado but it does occasionally flirt with SyFy Original Movie territory. \n\nHowever, there's some guilty fun to be had thanks to David Hasselhoff appearing as 'himself', a combination of his Baywatch character and Brad Pitt's moronic stoner from True Romance.",

Katrina Bowden is alright doing her best with the thinly written material, but the sex scene featuring the penis eating Piranha is ghastly and one of those moments that will leave you saying \"what did I just see?\". The issue with these types of movies is that if the first is successful and gains a fan base, they'll thrown in a sequel that lacks the thought and fun the original had, it genuinely does feel like a quick cash in. Despite bad writing and a bland story filled with disposable characters the 3D effects are utilised brilliantly, boasting effective depth both underwater and above, the water threatens to leak out the screen and there are a tonne of leap in your face effects that are so much fun to experience, but when you realise that the 3D and two actresses are the only good point of a movie there's concern.",

It's obvious from the outtakes that the cast and crew had a great time making it, but only some of that comes through in the finished product. There's not much of a story as the film relies on the original to do most of the set up for this film, and the special effects are mostly sub-par.\n\nThe blood flows freely, but a lot of the deaths aren't very convincing and the film features one of the phoniest decapitations in recent memory. Maybe if I had seen the film in its intended 3-D format, it wouldn't have looked so fake. The film is filled mostly with fresh faces, but thankfully it's also peppered with some veterans who provide the few laughs this does manage. The fact that Ving Rhames even returned for the sequel is hilarious, but so is his performance, and David Hasselhoff steals the show here playing himself. His comic, self deprecating turn is the absolute highlight of this otherwise forgettable effort.\n\nEven the plentiful nudity is disappointing mostly because everything looks surgically enhanced. When a movie fails at gratuitous nudity, there's a problem. \"Piranha 3-DD\" is a breezy, fast-paced time-killer that does everything to excess.

Here's a movie with next to no brains that actually manages to get less than expected out of its premise. It spends too much time with worthless characters. There's not quite as many gratuitous 3D DD breast shots as some might expect, and the violence isn't nearly as rough and graphic as that seen in the first film. This is a largely humorless, excessively juvenile, and dramatically vacant film. The last in the list doesn't really matter seeing that nobody goes to Piranha 3DD expecting a smart movie, but even the supposed \"good stuff\" flops as badly as a fish out of water. It's a borderline miserable movie, saved by good production values and several cool cameos.",

            "content": "Piranha 3DD can clearly not be a film with a chance if being as good as its predecessor, and Piranha 3D was a satire on modern horror films and the idiocracy of modern youth. And frankly, satire needs no sequel.\n\nThe plot dynamics seem less half-assed in their construction than in Piranha 3D, and the script is frankly too insulting and unintelligent that it diverts Piranha 3DD from satire to being a self-parody with lame jokes and the only laugh coming from an inside joke between me and friends that coincidentally occurred at a low point in the script. Although the script is already low enough, it sinks lower. So low that the piranhas might as well tear it up for invading their below-earth caverns.\nAnd another problem is the incessant waiting that it takes until the \"climactic\" final moment. Piranha 3D recognised that it was ideal for the action to start big and to continue on that path, but instead in Piranha 3DD there is small scaled failed attempts at thrills until 53 minutes in when the scale makes its overdue jump to what is at best a medium scale gore fest which constantly ignores and forgets about what is happening to the point that things have apparently stopped occurring. Piranha 3DD acts like it doesn't take itself seriously but on the surface it unintentionally attempts to establish an atmosphere that actually does, proving to be the film's major downfall.\nPiranha 3DD is merely painful to watch, not because of its horror, but because it is horrible. The first 36 minutes feel like they've run for twice that long since the plotting is full and directionless thanks to John Gulager's lack of job as director who in his best attempts to work with a $5 Million budget merely ends up with a film that is terribly cheap and utterly stupid with significantly less entertainment value than its predecessor, as well as less tits, rendering the tentative titled Piranha 3DD misleading. Basically, the scale for this film is too small and its utterly so stupid that it ends up with the qualities of a Sci Fi Channel low-budget horror movie that happens to have been filmed in 3D. Alas, this misleads viewers to think it may be somewhat better than the expect. This is a reason that people should follow their instincts.\n\nAlthough, certain scenes in Piranha 3DD are reminiscent of the original 1978 Joe Dante film Piranha which started the whole legacy which spawned Piranha 3D and this sequel to it which was decent. And some of the celebrity cameos weren't half bad, such as Gary Busey, David Hasselhoff, Christopher Lloyd and badass Ving Rhames.\nPlus, Danielle Panabaker was a decent lead actress in Piranha 3DD.\nBut to put it simply, the D's in Piranha 3DD stand for dumbfounded and disastrous.

Relies on more gross-out humor than previous plus the action and the characters aren't as believable. Christopher Lloyd, Paul Scheer, and Ving Rhames reprise their roles while Gary Busey and David Hasselhoff are given cameo roles. The best addition to the cast was definitely David Koechner who played a role he's perfected as Todd Packer/Champ Kind (and used elsewhere, ie, Snakes on a Plane, etc).

And now there's the next instalment, Piranha 3DD. Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames return for a another blood soaked, tittiefest. Using their network of underwater caves and rivers the piranha have migrated to another town where they find their way into a heavily populated waterpark... a SEXY waterpark. This might not have the same impact of the previous movie but its a very worthy sequel. It's got every cliche in the book, loads of big bouncing boobs, flesh chomping fishies and yes, another dick gag! Its super fun and exactly what you would hope to see, well me anyway. Add to the cast a cameo by Gary Busy, a self referential David HasselHoff (who has a great Baywatch moment) and David Koechner as the dickhead park owner. I was half expecting Piranha 3DD to be a cheap direct-to-dvd stinker but it maintains most of the quality of the last one... it was directed by the guy who made the 'Feast' trilogy, which was cool... oh and it has a wicked final frame, CHOMP!",

            "content": "I really liked the first Piranha 3D.  It was a great homage to B-movie creature features.  Lots of gore and stupid characters getting eating in gruesome ways.  It had tons of really great deaths and even some characters you actually kinda liked.  So when the sequel came out (geniously name Piranha 3DD!), I had to see it.  Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to see it in 3D in the theater, but I finally found it ona Redbox and snatched it up.  And I must say... It is quite a disappointment.  3DD is less of a homage and more of a parody.  Which is fine, but it veers into Scary Movie territory and turns into nothing but a bunch of cheap pop culture references and unfunny gags.  The biggest offense is that the gore is ridiculously toned down.  It's obvious that this movie had a tiny budget and it really feels like a direct-to-video B-movie.  It has a few decent deaths, but most of the gore is hidden behind cloudy red water and anything substantial is replaced by people just running with red water all over them.  The huge Piranha invasion doesn't even happen until the last 20 minutes or so of the movie and the rest of it is wasted doing pretty much nothing.  It spends way more time showing naked girls then what you really want to see, which is people getting eaten by fish.  It's odd that the movie is hampered by budget and unable to do with better makeup effects because it's directed by John Gulager, who made the indie horror movie Feast, which was pretty good and had some good gore in it as well.  It could have been because this one was shot in 3D... I would have much preferred this be made in 2D and post-converted and had way better gore.\n\nAnother weird thing is that either the makeup department sucked in this movie, or the actors are purposely made up to look washed up and old.  Danielle Panabaker and Katrina Bowden, who are usually both very attractive and young-looking, both look old and washed up here.  What happened?\n\nAnyway, the only thing this movie has going for it is that it's a direct sequel to the Iraq movie with some call-backs to it and even some recurring characters.  I'm not sure why they ditched to giant piranha thing the last movie ended with, though.  This movie again ends with a cliff hanger with the piranhas evolving, but eh, I didn't really care.",

If you thought PIRANHA 3D was in poor taste, you ain't seen nuthin' yet! The creative team behind the cult-classic FEAST takes over in this direct-to-video sequel, and they have really nailed it this time. PIRANHA 3DD shoots way over the top with its crude humor and exploitative fun, throwing political-correctness to the wind along with plenty of limbs and bikini tops. Don't let the 'R' rating fool you... This film has more gratuitous nudity and violence than any Uncut DVD on the market. All contextualized, of course. Where PIRANHA 3D never struck an even balance between the humor and horror, director John Gulager and writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan keep the pace moving a mile a minute as they shock, entertain, and completely disgust along the way. If that weren't enough, PIRANHA 3DD unleashes the one-and-only David Hasselhoff in a brilliant self-parody for the final act.

This is one of the drawbacks as it doesn't have the great Florida Spring Break setting working for it like the original so every aspect of the story is on a smaller scale. The nudity seems slightly unnecessary this time round, not that male viewers will do much complaining. Takes a light-hearted approach to horror, a direction that really works in its favour in the final scenes at the water park where some of the silly jokes conjure up a few laughs. Commits the sin like practically all the 3D messes out there and inserts little 3D bits that appear tacky. Luckily, it doesn't bombard you with them. Can be enjoyed with some buddies when something easy is required but it is nothing to scream about.",

Also, the film has some jokes that hit the right spot, as well as certain scares or high tension moments that do leave you on the edge of your seat. However, a crummy story, bad character development, terrible effects, and a horror of a directing job all make this film a mediocre horror/comedy, which should've gone straight to DVD. Where this movie excels is in the pre-advertised nudity that the film presents from the very title. Topless women and random moments of humor based on sexual themes are put in the place of an actual compelling script, which keeps male audiences watching, but not truly interested in characters or where the story could go. Overall, I'd say it's a fun movie to watch with friends, if you've had a few drinks and/or don't mind watching a movie for the laughs of how bad and outrageous it is.",

            "content": "Piranha 3DD doubles up the ante, breast, gore, and cameos, but is a half*** film. Piranha 3DD continues after the bloody massacre in Lake Victoria. Swimmers and sun bathers retreat to the waterparks for safety, but that will no longer be any help since the piranhas have found a way to infiltrate it. Piranha 3DD includes a number of cameos from the previous films: Paul Scheer, Ving Rhames, and Christopher Lloyd. However, new guys step in like Gary Busey, David Koechner, and David Hasselhoff. Marine biologist student Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) returns to her old job at a water park for the summer. Among her friends, she is pleased until she discovers that her favorite water park has been turned into some sleazy sex pool for adults featuring topless babes and cameras by the ladders to capture shots of the female body, classy. All of this is from her stepdad Chet (Koechner) as he remodeled the place for his own appetite. Lifeguards are replaced with certified water strippers, swimming area for adults, and did I tell you the location of the camera? This sleazy perverted recreation is the least of Maddy's worries as friends begin to disappear at a nearby lake. Where could have they gone to? Well, it is discovered that piranhas are the culprit, so she goes to her friends who are also competing for her love: Barry (Matt Bush) and Kyle (Chris Zylka). They too are puzzled, so they go to the one man that will know the answers, Mr. Goodman (Lloyd). He warns them that piranhas are powerful to bite through steel and be attracted to chlorine for an utterly confusing reason. She pleads with Chet, but he is the least interest since tomorrow is the opening day, wow. Like said, the piranhas manage to infiltrate the water park and turn Big Wet into a Hometown Buffet. Piranha 3DD is the sequel to Piranha 3D which served as a revision rather than a remake. The film was fantastic and fun, but here Piranha 3DD is similar and a closer remake to the original film by Joe Dante. I still do not understand how the film is a parody of Jaws, but whatever. It is entertaining, wet, and wild, but also falls really short to being a completed film. I was quite disappointed with the writing and story. The acting is unintentionally funny with other laugh out loud, but feel bad moments. I wanted a little more closer with the characters and timing with girls in their bikinis. I also wanted to have a little more fun watching the Big Wet before the massacre because the film is only two parts: prior Big Wet's opening and the massacre. The piranhas were brought in a little too early.",

Given the 2 year expanse between the original film, I was expecting a higher quality of horror, gore and a sick sense of comedy, but upon watching it I was incredibly ashamed to have ever wanted to see this. The redesign of the piranhas was a total and complete let-down, the cameo of Gary Busey at the very beginning was completely wasted! A favorite comedian of mine and my girlfriend's to show up in an Arizona bayou, only to be devoured by these bottom-rate revamped piranhas (I wouldn't even call them third rate the design is THAT bad! ) is a complete waste of his talent! The \"lifeguards\" being sluts due to the oh-so-over-used \"perverted old man\" gig and one male lifeguard (David Hasselhoff) who doesn't even care about anything but publicity and beautiful women, it's just completely sickening! I would have to say that the only good things about this film are very few and INCREDIBLY far between. A horror-comedy? HAH! What a joke... Sorry to spoil it for any readers out there, but COME ON! A perverted old man reopens a water park, replaces all the GOOD lifeguards with \"water certified\" sluts and David Hasselhoff, the step-daughter hates him, and, what do you know, he's illegally pumping water into the park from a piranha infested lake. The two timing \"cop\" who's to chicken to even do anything, even to save the girl he's in love with, was just in it for the money, and the entire \"plot\" DARE I call it that, was completely skewered to these cheap-as-fuck, ass-wiping over-gore! \n\nI am just so appalled that they would dare call this a sequal, and to think, they left it open for a TRILOGY! WHAT THE HELL IS FUCKING WRONG WITH YOU?! Okay, I admit, I'm GLAD that they brought back the old marine biologist, Mr. Goodman, back, though they made him a little crazy and it was just terrible that they reused scenes from the first movie! We've already done the \"get the slut from under the round floatie\" thing. Why ruin something that was even better in the original? \"Fish That Walk Among Us\" hm... I do believe they, oh, I don't know... ALREADY EXIST ON THIS PLANET CURRENTLY! There ARE fish that can breathe air and \"walk\" on land for periods of time people! You don't need to make these cheap ass, failed remakes do it too! Another GOOD thing they did in this movie was bring back the sheriff, Ving Rhames \"Deputy Fallon\", from the first movie who kicked ass in the original at the cost of his legs. BUT they made him a total pussy, who's afraid of the water until the piranhas return, where he gets his original vamp back and saves some innocents, despite the fear. There was nothing really \"funny\" or \"comedic\" about the movie at all. The ONLY reason I laughed was because of what happened to Ashley, because, I'm \"so mature.\" Come on, a piranha swam up into her, proceeded to tear her up from the inside out, then bit her fuck buddies dick! that's really all there was to that. \n\nWhy? Why did you have to go and ruin something that, personally, was good and try to ruin it for me? Seriously... What a total disaster. Whatever you do, DON'T WATCH THIS F - - MOVIE!!!  You have better uses for your money and time.\n\nThe only good things about this movie: the cheesy-as-fuck love scenario where the guy does something he's afraid of most to save the girl (well, doesn't that sound like EVERY movie out there now-a-days?), Mr. Goodman, Deputy Fallon and his kickass-ness, the cameo of Gary Busey and the fact that the fat guy fucking blew up the water park with ammonia and chlorine, two extremely flammable chemicals, that's really it. The rest was just a waste of a movie and funding.\n\nIt is not worth any time to consider this movie at all for any kind of \"good time.\" You'd be better off watching some other horror-comedy if you want to get your sick kicks. Or better yet, just watch some horror and comedy separately. Go watch Mirrors or The Exorcist or SOMETHING! This is not worthy of anyone's time.",

It's almost like he tied a flip camera to a dog and let it run around a water park for an hour and whatever turned up he used. There are a couple shots in the film where for some reason the resolution of the camera just turned to shit. Like the scene where the cop car is driving down the road and the camera zooms out and the screen gets all fuzzy and blurry. Maybe i got a defective dvd or something, but I doubt it. The CGI is also horribly fake and honestly it kind of irritated me. You might think the only saving grace in this film would be the boobs, but guess what? Most of those aren't even fun to look at. They're mostly just gross saggy stripper boobs. This is probably the worst movie of 2012. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, John Carter, The Apparition, and House at the End of the Street are all contending but I think this one might barely squeeze out the victory.

D is also an accurate grade for this film. What worked so well in Piranha 3D needs to be justified in 3DD, and it just doesn't work as well. The jokes aren't really that funny, and the cameo effectiveness is usually for just one sight gag and not well thought out (with a couple exceptions). Loosely held together by a boring story with meh characters, Piranha DD deflates as much as its A cup lead Maddy (Danielle Panabaker).\r\n\r\nAcross from Lake Victoria (the site of the first Piranha) the pack fish have found another entry to an adult water park run by Maddy's dad Chet (David Koechner). Maddy is home from summer vacation hanging out with her pot smoking (Paul James Jordan), slutty (Meagan Tandy), virginal (Katrina Bowden), virginity-taking (Jean-Luc Bilodeau), past-lover (Chris Zylka), and new love prospect (Matt Bush) friends. She is trying to save her family's waterpark and warn people about the fish, which shockingly fall on deaf ears. Deaths ensue, usually gory, some sexual, and the credits roll.\r\n\r\nAnytime the plot brings up something that could be interesting, it reverts back to its trajectory. The chewed penis is brought back in the most elaborate inconcieveable way possible. The love triangle between Maddy, the ex, and the prospect actually had both guys be alright at the beginning, but they set the ex up to be secretly a bad guy by the middle because you're supposed to root for him (even though he can't swim). By minute 10 I was counting down to the bloody end, and it would be fine if the end was really pulpy fun. Instead it tries to set up too elaborate sight gags with little payoff. Several characters meet their end, and Koechner's is the only one kind of funny and shocking.\r\n\r\nPiranha 3D had two of the best cameos in recent memory with Richard Dreyfus at the beginning and Jerry O'Connell as a Girls Gone Wild type. Offed in the first movie, they are replaced with Gary Busey (not great) and David Hasselhoff, the one bright spot, playing a bored version of himself who condescends to how stupid his own fans are. He gets most of the best lines, and was the only character I was rooting to not die. Christopher Lloyd reprises his character in the first with better lines and more fun. Paul Scheer and Ving Rhames are cute, but do not get enough screen time.\r\n\r\nTo spend more time talking about Piranha 3DD would mean that people would think I am recommending it. To earn your DD, just watch the first Piranha twice. The only saving grace of Piranha 3DD is that Piranha 3DDD needs to build their story around David Hasselhoff's movie script he was writing throughout the movie. That will be amazing.",

While the movie did have its moments where I laughed and a couple of the death scenes were absolutely hilarious... this movie really didn't have the awesome climax that the first movie had.  Changing the setting from a lake to a pool wasn't probably the best idea.  It just didn't lend itself to being a good scene to have bloody carnage.  While the previous had tons of people getting eaten and ravaged by piranhas, the pool setting had maybe 20 or so and it came off really weak.  It was a huge lost opportunity but I really blame that on the bad script and story.   That being said, I did enjoy it for what it was worth.  I was just hoping for a bit more.

I found the 2010 Piranha to be a sheer blast of campy entertainment, with some world-class gore effects and a game cast. I was actually terribly excited about a sequel; I'm ashamed to admit it now. Where did things go so horribly wrong? Much like Expendables 2, the movie's tone shifts from tongue-in-cheek 80s throwback to meta self-awareness. The movie becomes more of a lousy comedy with some absurd violence rather than a horror movie with a nasty sense of humor. The entire premise is so labored, that a water park would become piranha-infested, and the characters are so unlikable; to dub them one-dimensional is to be too kind. The acting is abysmal even by bottom-of-the-barrel B-movie standards. The celebrity cameos feel wasted, with David Hasselhoff soaking up every second of desperation. The tension is next to nil and the gore effects are pretty cheesy, trading gallons of blood for ingenuity (many character deaths occur off screen, like Gary Busey's). Then once the piranhas strike, the movie just completely abandons any sense of reality and becomes a gonzo comedy of the absurd, with characters behaving like idiots from another dimension. There's even one character that gets decapitated by a simple string of flags. It's at this point that Piranha 3DD drops any slapped-together sense of purpose. And yet this ghoulish mess can only barely make it to a scant 70 minutes (good luck getting through the abominably unfunny end credits outtakes). Reportedly, 3DD had almost the same budget of 3D. Where the hell did that money go? Piranha 3DD completely misfires on every level, failing as a horror movie, a horror-comedy, a comedy, a gore movie, hell, as a suitable movie. Whatever the metric, this movie blows. If you're hard-pressed for gratuitous nudity soaked in blood, watch the superior 2010 Piranha film instead. I'm going to start drinking heavily and forget I ever looked forward to this monstrosity on taste.\r\n\r\nNate's Grade: D",

I didn't like the chicks they cast for the virgins trust me they are not believable as virgins and besides the cameos you don't care who lives or dies. As for the cameo's it's a nice set witch makes this movie worth the watch David Koechner, Gary Busey, Paul Scheer, from the first movie Ving Rhames, and David Hasselhoff as HIMSELF! With Christopher Lloyd as the crazy scientists witch is a mix of doc brown and uncle fester. The movie should have been seen in 3D but if you are in the mood for a cheesy B-movie with blood gore and boobs the check out PIRANHA 3DD......cheers and life will never suck as long as there is a movie to watch\n \n5.5 out of 10 \n@mikes_moviepick",

Poor plot and filled with nothing but nudity and violence thrown right in your face (even more so in 3D) However, with a title like Piranha 3DD, that's kind of what you'd be expecting and that's exactly what I was hoping for.\nI've also heard alot of people complaining about the special effects in this film. That I simply do not understand. The CGI is pretty much on par with it's predesessor and on top of that, DD has gone to the effort to use pupperty and animatronics. Which is fantastic!\nThe plot follows Maddy, a young girl whos step father has turned her family waterpark into some kind of x-rated strip club pool thing. Anyway, this former waterpark has now been invaded by the pre-historic killer piranhas on it's grand opening. Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames return with brilliant cameos, but the best has to be Hasselhoff's hilarious performance as Hasselhoff.\nPiranha 3DD is definately not the kind of film to be taken seriously. This is the kind of film you put on if you just want to sit back and watch some boobs, gore and David Hasselhoff",

The gore is nowhere as awesome, the jokes are putrid (and they repeat them; there's only so many times that slow motion is funny), the characters are stock and stupid as hell, and it's barely a movie as the last ten minutes are terrible outtakes and extremely long end credits. Even though the first was extremely campy, it had a great cast that included Elisabeth Shue, Richard Dreyfus, and Eli Roth... this one has Gary Busey and about a million horrible David Hasselhoff jokes. Who honestly thinks Davide Hasselhoff is cool? They tried to doing for him what they did for Mike Tyson in The Hangover, but it's eye-rolling and an embarrassing waste of time.\n\nThe first was smutty, but it was a great self-parody. DD removed all of the funny and upped the smut to unenjoyable levels. There's three editors for this turkey and it shows... there are a lot of scenes that feel rushed. I can't remember any of the teen character names; they're all the same stupid dead teenager character you've seen in a million slasher flicks.

            "content": "Back in 2010, a sleeper hit called Piranha 3D hit theaters and treated viewers to a teenage wonderland of carnage and gratuitous nudity.Personally, the first film was not perfect, but it knew what it was and had fun with it making the movie fun to watch.  Needless to say it appealed to enough people to inspire the sequel Piranha 3DD a significantly horrendous film that takes everything remotely enjoyable from the first movie and makes it vile and not fun in the least bit. I can not express enough how much i personally loathe the film. There is nothing remotely entertaining about this film and there was a few things going for it but it was all held back by logic, script, plot, and how much it relies on cameos and nudity. The overall point of being a sequel is to somehow continue the story in a linear fashion. They mention the first movie at the very beginning and about three quarters of the way in, but the logic for the sequel doesnt make any sense. They say that this piranha attack would be worse than the one in the first film, but the attack takes place in a decently populated water park and the first was at a lake during Spring Break. In what world does a water park out weigh a massacre at a lake during Spring Break? It just doesn't make sense. The they revealed theat there were giant piranhas in the last film, but they are nowhere to be found in this one but somehow they evolve. The story is just sloppy to say the least. The story revolves around a piranha attack in a water park, but theres a bad love triangle and typical horror movie cliches that dumb this movie down below the point of cheesey horror. Plus the addition of terrible cgi blod and piranhas just make the story even more of a hard sell. On top of the worst logic imaginalbe, the script is not helping this abomination. The dialogue is so bad, i found it hard to even laugh at how bad it is. The dialogue revolves around profanity when the jokes arn't landing and then they try and throw in as many  jokes as possible to try and pander to the college audience. It doesn't work at all because the movie is that bad. The main problem i had with this movie is how much it relied on cameos and nudity. There are great choices for cameos mainly with Gary Busey and David Hasselhoff. Great choices because they are univerally funny, until they made this garbage. They don't work, Busey is too serious and Hassellhoff comes off as a jerk rather than a funny cameo. The main cameo that bothered me  was Ving Rhames. They made his chracter a legless veteran that wears his same clothes he did in the last movie and is now scared of water. It's not funny, its sad and poor writing. The movie's main sell is on the amount of nudity that is in it. In their defense, they didn't lie. There is a large amount of female nudity, but it was to the point where they relied on it to make people like the movie, but the camera work is so shoddy the nudity even looks bad. Let me rephrase, granted these girls make a barbie doll look like a real person, but still, it takes extra effort to make nudity bad in a teenage college movie. Overall, i can not express my hatred for this pile of filth enough. It isn't funny, it isn't entertaining, the gore looks bad, this is just a terrible excuse of a movie and will porbably top my list for the worst movies of 2012.

The gore and cgi all look very cheap and dull and the result is some pretty horrendous scenes that are directed really badly, make no sense, and just really fake. When piranhas would be feasting on a bunch of people, the camera would just move around so much that you wouldn't be able to see what was going on and at other times the camera zooms in too much when they are eating people. Gary Busey, Christopher Lloyd, and David Hasselhoff are all completely wasted here and their cameos didn't make the film any better. A thing this film really likes to show off is tits, all the boob scenes are just stupid as hell and the only reason why they are in the movie is just to give teenage boys hard ons, if I wanted to see tities I can just google them instead of having to watch this crappy ass movie to see them.

            "content": "Sequel to last year's Piranha 3D (Which in itself is a remake) is nowhere near as fun but, it is also not as bad as it's been made out to be. Problem is, director John Gulager seems to take the material a little too seriously despite a script that replaces Piranha 3D's wit for blatantly stupid. And stupid would be fine in the case of a story about prehistoric piranha who travel from the decimated Lake Victoria through an underground river to a sleazy water theme park, if, director Gulager took the ball and ran with it like Alexandre Aja did. His cast is fine but, again only David Hasselhoff is in on the joke and the rest of the cast, including pretty lead Danielle Panabaker, are just too straight faced for a goofy flick like this. I do understand that the budget was smaller and thus the film's scale and carnage lesser but, look how fun the low budget original was without the budget and carnage of the 2011 remake. Joe Dante knew to play it serious to a point but, all the while letting the cast and audience in on the fun. When you open a film with Gary Busey and a dead cow that farts piranha eggs, there's no point in pretending you're directing Jaws. The gore effects are fine although the CGI is even weaker then it's predecessor but, despite it's faults, there is some entertainment to be had. The cameos from some of the survivors from the last entry are fun and there are some funny bits, most involving The Hoff. It could have been a lot better but, Piranha 3DD did pass the time and I actually feel that with a better script and more serious story, John Gulager might actually deliver a decent B-movie. An OK time waster but, far short of the deliriously fun remake that precedes it.",

            "content": "Just when you thought it was safe to go to your local water park, \"Piranha 3DD\" is released on not-so-innocent viewers. The follow-up to 2010's critically acclaimed box-office success \"Piranha\" did little business in theaters. Hopefully it will gain a little more attention from home audiences.\n\nA school of mutated piranhas enter a water park through its piping systems. The step-daughter of its crooked co-owner must find a way to close off the man-eating creatures' access to the amusement facility. The employees of the park attempt to rescue the thrill-seeking swimmers before they're devoured by the aquatic monsters.\n\nRoger Corman's name may not be found in the credits of this sequel, but his spirit is felt throughout it. It's the usual over-the-top creature feature we've all become accustomed to seeing from the B-movie king. Imagine \"Jaws\" if it took place in a water park the kids in \"Porky's\" worked at during the summer. That's the level of entertainment you get from watching \"Piranha 3DD.\"\n\nThe CGI and practical effects are a grade above what one would expect from a movie of this nature. There are parts where the piranhas look less than spectacular, but it doesn't distract from the overall fun atmosphere of the film. Most of the special make-up effects are very well-done. The different severed body parts all look impressively realistic.\n\n\"Piranha 3DD\" delivers B-movie schlock in its finest form. I don't know how it could get any better (or worse?) than this. It's crude, gory, funny, and successfully self-aware. A great high-definition transfer and a few interesting special features make this a recommended buy for fans of Roger Corman creature features and the likes. \n\nhttp://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",

It was just gross.  I never expected this to be good but i was mildly interested because of Gary Busey and David Hasselhoff's roles.  But they were big letdowns.  Gary Busey's character literally disappears early in the movie with absolutely no mention later.  And- David Hasselhoff from the trailer looked like he'd be playing a spoof of his baywatch character.  But I was hoping for the nicer, cooler side of that character- instead he plays the ultimate scumbag and media whore.  I know they're trying to play up the \"love to hate\" type of character but he was just annoying and unfunny.  Some of the lead women actresses in this were nice looking but the beach bimbos they get topless and naked in this look like second rate porn stars.  Some of them just looked repulsive and freakish.  This is by far a comedy and takes nothing in its mythology or story at all serious, which is why every joke, every character, every moment of the movie is just throwaway and pointless.",

It is like the filmmakers were out of ideas. Only Hasselhoff comes off being surprisingly funny making fun of himself. Lloyd is fun in the movie's best and only simple scene. Rhames is a hoot in this one. The movie could have used more of Busey instead of a cameo role and always funny Koechner is wasted in a supporting role.

            "content": "So I thought that I needed to start reviewing movies properly again... So what better way than with the one and only Piranha 3DD. Now this movie has been completely and utterly ripped apart by critics and audiences a like, and I can see why, but after all these reviews, my standards were so low that it did surprise me on the main factor that I didn't think this movie was boring and I actually thought that Hasselhoff was the best part of this movie and actually created a few funny, and even clever moments. Now saying that he is 'the best part of the movie' isn't the biggest of compliments, I can appreciate that, but this movie isn't as god awful as some have said, and I think it is justifiable sequel to the first movie, although there is a lot of bad in this movie don't get me wrong. With pretty awful directing and some of the worst lines in recent movie history, it was bad on that scale, but, for me, it surpassed the scale of just being bad, but enjoyably bad. I enjoyed it enough that I don't hate it and that is down to a few parts here and there that just made it better, e.g. Christopher Lloyd, The Hoff and Gary Busey, apart from that that the performances are pretty god awful, but it is only 70 minutes long with actual story, so it isn't exactly slow, but I expected so much worse and just settled for a less than average. The only reason this isn't lower is because of the funny cameos, although it was depressing to see them in a sequel to Piranha out of anything else, but this will have to do for now.\n\nThe direction in this movie is pretty messy, with a lot of choppy editing and some shots that generally just look bad. It did seem to lack some of the real funny moments from the first one and I would have to say, similar to the first, that the first 30 minutes or so are just god awful, with some scenes that are so ridiculously gory and stupid that it just puts you off the movie, and then lines that followed that were made for laughs but just came off as lazy and stupid. That is the main problem with the direction here is that everything just felt a bit lazy, especially in the first half of this movie, as people ponder around, a few set pieces, but there are so many scenes with awful acting from the nobody actors and actresses of the horror industry, that you just watch and start to roll your eyes, line by line. The main problem here is that the ending is set up throughout the movie and you are waiting and waiting, then it happens, and then you are waiting and waiting and waiting. Credits. And that is it, you just experienced something that is respectfully risky but equally grotesque and slightly over the line. But still there is so much more fun that could have been had here, as they bring these interesting side characters in, who are so much more interesting and fun compared to the main characters, and they don't get much to do, and it reflected so poorly on the film.\n\nThis is the problem that I almost feel bad for giving this film a higher rating as I am truly aware that this is a bad, bad movie in a lot of ways, but I strangely enjoyed it at the same time, although being aware that everything that was happening was bad. The script in this movie was pretty awful and I think some of the lines just fell through, and I remember one line that David Koechner to his step daughter that is so childish and obviously lazy that is really off putting to watch on screen. Added to this, there are a few things that happen that just feel unnecessary, as some people who were bad first then find resolutions who are then killed off etc, and with a mildly amusing ending which brings it back to the feeling of the first film, where it gets that exploitation feel. It then ends. And it just feels a bit empty, and you then realize that this movie was extremely short, and should have probably just been a straight to DVD, or Straight to 3D Blu-ray. Also, I will say that I thought the 3D was fine and there were a few moments that worked well, but there seemed to be a few scenes that were a bit messy, and other scenes that seemed to be lacking in that real 3D effect.\n\nThe movie as a whole is simply down to how much you are bothered by the complete stupidity of the film, and how much you enjoy turning your brain off. I agree that you shouldn't have to. and especially to this extent, but if you have that ability, whenever Hasselhoff or Lloyd is on screen you will probably have a reasonably good time, but then the main characters will start speaking. And then it will just end.",

That just made it funnier, that's one damn hell of a hilarious movie, seriously the 1st one is just awesome, this is just not, the acting on some parts is really horrible, like the guy who has a piranha stuck up to his butt, now come on seriously?, the story buildup is just not quite what i've expected, just them going to the lake. found a piranha, though it may come to the waterpark and poof! where is the intense part there? Atiitude?

He's got strippers as lifeguards, underwater cams to film all the hot action in the pools and even invited non other than David Hasselhof to the opening day.

But (of course) she fails to prevent a bloodbath...\n\nThis movie has stupid, but very sexy, people getting killed by the fakest fish you've ever seen, in all sorts of sexual ways. When a couple has sex, the man gets his penis bitten off by a baby-piranha that is inside the womans vagina... I admit: I had a few good laughs, so it's more comedy than horror.

I was excited to see the red band trailer with the realization that Project Greenlight horror director, John Gulagar was taking the helm.  The film's marketing promises more bustier bikini-wearing girls losing their tops to escape the flesh eating fish, and it lives up to it's promise.  However, don't go into the sequel with high expectations because neither the story, the CGI of the Piranha, nor the quality of fleshy women even come close to its predecessor.  \n\nMaddy, Danielle Panabaker, is a college coed with a wicked stepfather who perverting her mother's water park, turning it into an adult themed fun land.  Meanwhile, the prehistoric piranhas have found a way out of Lake Victoria into the stripper-filled cesspool, and it's Maddy who leads the charge to save the water park guests.  It is not a bad premise, but there is a lack of development and introduction to the characters in the story.  Matt Bush is perfect to play the nerdy kid infatuated with Maddy, but he's given no satisfying character arc.  Although he needs to be pathetic, a redeeming quality should be revealed to convince the audience and Maddy to fall in love with him.   \n\nThere are some good casting choices in the film.  Christopher Lloyd returns as the scientist who studies the fish; he was a wonderful surprise in the first film.  David Koechner is perfect for the role as a sleazy stepfather.  And David Hasselhoff was actually hilarious reprising his role as a Baywatch lifeguard.  However, a travesty was committed when casting the most important roles.  There may have been double the D's, but they cast girls of the hard plastic variety.  I find it appalling that the director didn't spend more time casting these most vital roles to the movie.   \n\nOn a more serious note, Piranha 3DD is missing a scenes that portray an interesting evolution of the fish or a scientific discovery from studying other predator fish.  It would have been exciting to see a school of piranha come up against another predator like a shark or an alligator.  I could imagine a shark swallowing a Piranha, only to be eaten from the inside out by the nasty fish.  Another example is the fish that can sense urine in the water and swims up a man's penis.  This would add a reason not to pee in the pool.   All this would add to the terror of swimming with a school of these fish in a pool.  \n\nIn the end, the film is an obvious melodrama about the dangers of promiscuous sex although the producers blatantly use tantalizing tits and astronomic asses to sell a ticket or dvd rental to thirteen year olds who still haven't figured out internet porn.  Piranha 3DD needed more story elements that furthered the mythology and evolution of the piranha, characters the audience care about, and more authentic bouncy buoyant boobs.  That being said, I still secretly hope there's a Piranha III 3D.",

            "content": "Some unknown years after the last Piranha attack, the evil fish return and this time look to hit up a water park and make a splash.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Piranha 3-D so I was a little letdown by this sequel.  The fact that the film makes fun of itself knowing it's bad is what made the first film so enjoyable.  3DD has that but it's just not as good a second time around.  The plot is paper-thin but really, it doesn't have to be Inception here.  The script itself is full of cheesy dialogue although there are some quotes here that I will never forget, especially one from Katrina Bowden.  Like the first film, it's more of a comedy than it a horror flick, but there are some very gory and bloody scenes.  Some of the moments here will have you rolling your eyes but there are some kills here that are flat out hilarious.  There's also a lot of nudity, unfortunately not from any of the main characters I wanted to see. The cast includes Danielle Panabaker as Maddy, our heroaine, Matt Bush as Barry, the guy who likes Maddy, David Koechner as Chet, the sleazy owner of the water park, Katrina Bowden as Shelby, a dumb blonde virgin, Chris Zylka as Kyle, Ving Rhames reprises his role as Deputy Fallon and Christopher Lloyd is back as well as the wacky Piranha expert.  One of the highlights of the film is a fun cameo from David Hasselhoff.  Make it clear, Piranha 3DD is in no way a great film but it did it's job of entertaining me and it was still better than Battleship.\r\n\r\nGets A-List Rating of: MEH\r\n\r\nyoutube: youtube.com/Wesida515\r\nfacebook: facebook.com/westroopalist\r\ntwitter: @WesAlist",

            "content": "Well the story of the film is pretty much Jaws 3-D, just with Piranhas. The Piranhas from the first film find a way to get in a water park and wreak havoc. \r\n \r\nPiranha 3DD doesn't really hold much in terms of deep storytelling, special effects etc. But viewers who just want to have fun while having spare time and money could enjoy it.  The film contains comedy, nudity and lots of gore. And gore hounds may cheer with joy when they see this. But I don't think the amount of gore rivals that of its predecessor. \r\n\r\nThe film benefits from some recognizable faces such as David Hasselhoff who played Mitch Buchannon in Baywatch and Christopher Lloyd who played Dr. Emmett Brown in the Back to the Future films.  David Hasselhoff plays a parody of himself in this film, expressing a more killjoy persona while Christopher Lloyd reprises his role as Mr. Goodman. Seeing both these characters in film gives a viewer like me a sense of nostalgia which added to the overall enjoyment of the film. And the two give funny and enjoyable performances, David Hasselhoff in particular. Danielle Panabaker plays the main heroine for the film. Panabaker is a pretty seasoned actress, appearing in films such as Sky High, The Crazies, The Ward, as well as a bunch of TV shows such as the Guardian, Law and Order Special Victims Unit etc. Panabaker does an okay job of portraying her character, though her character here doesn't leave that much of an impression in my eyes. The film also benefits from some scenes with Ving Rhames and Garey Busey.  \r\n\r\nThe movie is probably not much to behold. But I think the movie does a good job of having the viewers forget their troubles for a few minutes, and I think that's what it's supposed to do.",

It couldn't have been worse, but could it be better, but even if it was better it would still be horrible. Thats how bad this is, the idea was never good in the first place. So why make it, probably because the creators of piranha 3-D thought if this movie is did good we should make a sequal. They also thought if it was in 3-D it will make just as much money, but guess what, Piranha 3DD turned out to be a big box office bomb. This movie is so horrible I dont need to explain why this movie stinks. So overall my review/rant explains this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I would give Piranha 3DD a half star out of five. No i would not recemened this for the blood fearing part of the audience, in fact I wouldn't recemened this for anyone. Its double the dumb, double the cheap thrills, and double the boring. As the tagline promises, double the action, double the terror, and double the D's. I would beg to differ there my friends.",

The film took the charactersAlexandre Aja's Piranha 3D was hardly a masterpiece, but it was a real movie. It was well shot, featured some pretty great makeup effects and sported a decent amount of tension, balanced with zany comedy. The film took the characters seriously, even though the horror spewing mayhem of the killer fish all around them was laugh-inducing. That was part of the film's charm. John Gulager's follow-up, on the other hand, has no charm, or class for that matter. Piranha 3DD is an awful film because it doesn't understand what made the first film work for most audiences. Instead, it swaps sly political and social subtext for stale, shameful cameos, derp jokes and juvenile gags fit for a crass Meet the Spartans-type spoof. Picking up a little while after the events of the first film, Piranha 3DD brings the killer fish to a wild water park run by a sleazy entrepreneur (David Koechner). And that's pretty much the whole plot of the film, which barely runs over an hour (sans credits). The water park is overrun with the monster fish, and the final twist of the first film (that there are mega piranhas) is pretty much left untapped. The characters are meaningless, and there's not a likeable soul inhabiting a single corner of picture. The film is gory, sure, but even the violence and mayhem isn't nearly as shocking, or amusing. It's just bloody and uninventive. The nudity also feels dialed back, which is bizarre given the film takes place at a water park patrolled by stripper lifeguards. There's breasts and bums all over the place, but Aja's film pulled a few full frontal scenes, including a hilariously tantalizing underwater ballet. There's nothing here that tops that, nor does the film ever even seem to want to try. And that's the problem with Piranha 3DD  it's not trying, at all. It's just a shallow, muddy killer fish film with paper-thin characters, an insultingly boring narrative and lifeless thrills. The cameos are remarkably embarrassing, especially a seemingly drunken David Hasselhoff (who's seen better days). The returning actors from the previous film (Ving Rhames, Christopher Lloyd and Paul Scheer  who died off-screen, mind you) stick out like a sore thumb, too. They don't work in the world Gulager has created, because his world isn't logical, and it's populated by moronic stereotypes and unrealistic non-human humans. Piranha 3DD is a terrible film, and that's a tragedy. There was room for a good sequel to Alexandre Aja's original, but John Gulager and crew messed it all up. What remains is pretty solid Blu-ray for a film that's barely even worth renting.",

DD takes an almost no holds barred approach when it comes to trying to one-up 3D in vulgarity and nudity. On top of there being fake breasts as far as the eye can see, these are also some of the most crass and crude gags I've ever witnessed. While some things like a farting cow corpse complete with a working butthole were a bit too juvenile for even my tastes, for the most part I was perfectly content to go along for the ride.That's because I don't demand too much from my B-movies, particularly not Piranha. Even back in 1978 all these films were really good for was a little bit of boobage, a lot of blood, and plenty of wacky hijinks along the way. So the lengths this is willing to go to in order to top the rest of the series in at least two of those categories was perfectly fine by me. That's what I came for after all.The only area where it takes a bit of a step back is in the carnage department. There's still plenty of gore and mayhem, but director John Gulager's kills are nowhere near as creative as Alexandre Aja's. Plus, trading the open lake setting of the previous entry for that of a water park makes the feeding frenzy feel much smaller in comparison. The entrail strewing goods are still delivered in a competent enough manner to make for a solid creature feature regardless, it's just clear they didn't really go for broke here like they did everywhere else.While I have yet to see Piranha II: The Spawning, I can't imagine it's any raunchier or more ridiculous than this. With tongue planted firmly in cheek, the franchise's most immature elements have been placed front and center and get taken to wild new heights. There's stuff here so nasty and irreverent you'd think you were watching another Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg collaboration. It's definitely dumb and gratuitous, but as someone who is really only in attendance for the sleazier aspects anyways I had fun seeing things get taken to the next self-aware level. Honestly, in a way it's kind of glorious in its tastelessness and stupidity.6.9/10",

The massive set piece (the water park) is stacked with possible gross out occurrences that never happen. Instead, we get a guy who is having his way with a pool drain. The cast is mostly wasted.

Much is much the same, but just more gory, more nudity, and more senselessness.  This sequel has a new director in John Gulager (\"Feast\"), but it does not offer anything fresh.  Just more gross out deaths that come across as more head-shaking than elaborate of shocking.  The only returning cast members are Christopher Lloyd as Carl, whom is the nutty scientist character that learns more about the ancient piranhas, and Ving Rhames as Sheriff Fallon, whom we all thought died in the first, but only lost his legs to the piranhas and is now able to attach a shotgun as leg instead.  New to the cast is the young Danielle Panabaker (\"Sky High\" and \"Friday the 13th\") as the lead and David Koechner (\"Anchorman\") as her dim-witted stepfather and owner of the water park where the majority of the killing takes place.  If you are a fan of the original, you may enjoy this one, but it is just same gore fest over again shot entirely in 3D and of course with continuous nudity of young women.  The only mere bright spot is a the cameo of David Hasselhoff as himself.  He actually has a few really funny scenes poking fun at himself and his career, but it comes nowhere close to saving the film.  Gary Busey also makes a early cameo in the film, but its a mellow return to film for him, it might have worked better for him if he actually poked fun of himself like Hasselhoff rather than playing a character.  Bottom line:  Only notable thing about the film is a cameo by Hasselhoff, the rest is a forgettable, gore dunce fest that overstays its welcome.",

I always try to find good in a film, but there are very few aspects of Piranha 3DD that made me enjoy it. The idea this film is based around is far-fetched to start with, but the creative team took it to an unfortunate extreme. Who was the protagonist? Who was the antagonist? What is stasis A and what is stasis B? Why do I care about any of the character's fates in this slaughterfest? If the director or any of the actors could answer these questions I would be impressed.

It never took itself seriously and had a solid cast. This follow-up to the 2010 movie is just honestly embarrassing. It had all the elements that the first movie had, but everything goes horribly wrong with incompetent direction, laughably bad acting and dialogue, and some of the cheapest gore effects I've ever seen.Why is this movie so bad? Let's start with the plot - there is none. If you can buy the premise that piranhas are going to go in underground lakes and somehow end up in a water park swimming, well then I have a bridge to sell you as well. The characters are all terrible. The one couple in the van early on exists only to die, no other purpose, no even attempted development. Yet later we see other characters mourning their disappearance, only it's forgotten 5 minutes later. The one scene that people will probably remember involves a girl that had a piranha swim up her lady parts (and somehow survive) only to bite her boyfriend's penis during intercourse. Trying to be inventive there, but really just shows the lack of any restraint with this movie. But even if you think the plot and acting are atrocious, at least there will be good gore, right? Wrong. The gore effects can be described in one word: cheap. The special effects with the piranhas are terrible too - you wonder where they spent $20 million on this movie. Not to mention, the inevitable massacre scene is shot so poorly that it has zero coherence and lacks any punch. It looks like they just poured some red dye in the pool and hired a few extras to flop around. The massacre scene in the first film had some of the best gore effects I'd ever seen. This is a joke of a follow-up.So which actors disgraced themselves for a paycheck? There is a cameo by David Hasselhoff where he's basically mocking himself, but you have to wonder what is going through his head when his character mutters \"Welcome to rock bottom.\" I wonder if the irony is lost on this man. David Koechner is just obnoxious and terrible. Jerry O'Connell played this type of character way better in the first film. Every time Koechner was on screen, I was just wanting him to get killed off already.And also surprisingly, we don't even get any good nudity. All the extras they hired for this movie look like washed up strippers. None of the cute female leads goes topless. Maybe they ran out of budget and couldn't pay them enough to do it.I have a feeling that 95% of the people involved in this film will ever have meaningful work in Hollywood again (thankfully).
