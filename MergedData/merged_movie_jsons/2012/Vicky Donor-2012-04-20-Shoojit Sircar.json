            "content": "wow...fantastic movie with the heavy n strong concept...... the movie contains about raw usage of script and more comedy with beautiful songs.... A must watch film.... Very difficult to find but some conservatives might not like the concept...A man is brought in by an infertility doctor to supply him with his sperm, where he becomes the biggest sperm donor for his clinic. Vicky Donor is a light hearted comedy that takes a look at the taboo attached to infertility and artificial insemination.The Story .. of courseDr Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), a well qualified fertility expert, runs a fertility clinic and a sperm bank in Dariyaganj, New Delhi, that guarantees a high quality and specialized sperm for the purpose. Unfortunately he has more failed cases to his credit than successes. A healthy, high performing donor is the need of the hour. Vicky Arora (Ayushmann Khurrana), a young, good-looking, Punjabi boy from Lajpat Nagar, is the only son and of no financial support to Dolly, a widow, who runs a small beauty parlor from home.As luck would have it, a small brawl in the colony brings Dr Chaddha and Vicky, face to face, where Chaddha, concludes that Vicky could be THAT donor he has been looking for. From here on, Chaddha's days and nights are spent in convincing Vicky to become a donor till he finally gives in. Vicky finds his love interest in Ashima Roy (Yami Gautam), a pretty Bengali girl, who works in a Bank. But soon their hunky dory world comes crashing down because of Vicky's past as a donor. With a brief emotional roller coaster ride, Vicky Donor is a light-hearted take on the subject of sperm donation.What to look out forSparkled with exceptional performance by Annu Kapoor as Dr. Chadda and the wonderful debut by Ayushmann Khurrana as Vicky Arora.. Vicky Donor is a fertile entertainer with focus to tell an endearing love story centered round sperm donation glory..John Abraham deserves a special pat for not following bollywood trends as a producer and opting for a out of the box subject on sperm donations for his debut as producer and not using his stardom and making way for a newcomer for a wonderful debut.. highly remarkable..Shoojit Sircar grows immensely as a story teller and shows vast improvement from Yahan (2005) to Vicky Donor. With the all round support of his writer Juhi Chaturvedi he captures the mood of Delhi in light, funny and tangy first half then giving us those genuinely stirring moments rather late in the game and ending up with a sweet note.All this wouldn't have been possible without the active support of Yami Gautam who makes a beautiful debut.. Watching her is treat to your eye and the girl delivers a sparkling performance.Dolly Ahluwalia is excellent as mom and Kamlesh Gill as the grand ma is outstanding.. Whenever she appears on screen she eats up other actor's presence. Jayanta Das as Yami's father is adequate.Music and dialogues are in sync with the film. Pani da song is the pick of the lot.. editing is sharp and other technicalities are fine. Production values are up to markWhat NotVery difficult to find but some conservatives might not like the conceptConclusion: Vicky Donor is avant grade cinema that is fertile at the Box Office. Those who complain Bollywood for running out of ideas.. 'Vicky Donor donates sperms of hope.. a must watch..",

            "content": "Blood Donation is an old theme nowadays. Why not sperm? Fertilization has been shown previously in movies like I AM, The Tree Of Life and more. But Vicky Donor bring an aspect of Comedy involving fertilization in the movie. That's a different and peculiar attempt introduced in Bollywood movie. A fresh theme with fresh stars featured in a feature film - Vicky Donor.John Abraham, The new boy in Producer Town does an earnest effort here and deals with a fresh theme based on a totally out-of-the-box concept. John after acting on 'masala maardhaar' movies now starts investing money on offbeat movies - that's strange but is smart also as the promos of Vicky Donor has a youth appeal also keeping beside the sperm oriented theme. Some in the town thinks Vicky Donor is somehow sex-oriented and disgusting in theme as it deals with such vulgar things like sperm donation and fertilization. Anyhow still Vicky Donor makes its individual impact in Bollywood and its pretty good.In an environment where the job pressures are high and couples lead an erratic and unhealthy lifestyle, Dr. Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), a well-qualified fertility expert, runs a fertility clinic and a sperm bank in Daryaganj, New Delhi. Unfortunately, he has more failed cases to his credit than successes. A healthy, high-performing donor is the need of the hour.Vicky Arora (Ayushymann Khurrana), a young, good looking Punjabi guy from Lajpat Nagar, is the only son and of no financial support to his mother Dolly (Dolly Ahluwalia), a widow, who runs a small beauty parlor from home. As luck would have it, a small brawl in the colony brings Dr. Chaddha and Vicky face to face, where Chaddha concludes that Vicky could be that donor he has been looking for. From here on, Dr. Chaddha's days and nights are spent in convincing Vicky to become a donor till he finally gives in.Vicky finds his love interest in Ashima Roy (Yami Gautam), a pretty Bengali girl, who works in a bank. But soon their hunky dory world comes crashing down because of Vicky's past as a donor.Vicky Donor is a special mixture of Youth, Romance, Sperm Donation type offbeat concept and Comedy. So, compilation like this is hard to find in recent movies and there's where VD wins the race for its individuality. Even being a small budget film, VD gives you the feel of the same amount of humor, romance and consciousness about the concept used in a big budget film. It enlightens, then entertains and then wins.Shoojit Sircar, after giving such a serious movie like YAHAAN (2005), it was very unlike to see a comic movie from him after 7 years. Anyway he deals very well with Vicky Donor and gives justice to the concept. Story, Dialogue and Script by Juhi Chaturvedi was very neat, sophisticated and came to a very good conclusion as the two parts of the movie was capably balance. Cinematography was not such a big deal for the movie but still good work done by Kamaljeet Negi. Editing by Shekhar Prajapati was good. The soundtrack of the movie is mediocre but still tracks like PANI DA RANG (sung, written and composed by the lead actor of the movie Ayushmann Khurrana), MAR JAIYAAN & RUM WHISKY work perfectly. These three songs are worth listen for many times. Background scores also by the music director duo Abhishek-Akshay duo are perfect for the movie.Shoojit Sircar, I must say has chosen the actors for the movie very aptly. The very famous face from the Television Ayushmann Khurrana is good-looking, humorous and a very good performer. The naturalism in his expression and act was fascinating and profound. Another fresh face from Television Yami Gautam was strikingly beautiful, sensible and a good performer. Her presence and charm in various sequences adds value to them. Annu Kapoor aka Dr. Chadda is an anomaly. His humorous acts, sensitive acting adds the movie a new aspect.Dolly Ahluwalia (Vicky's Mom) was very well as well as Kamlesh Gill (Vicky's grand-mom). Jayanta Das (Ashima's father) was fine. John Abraham makes a stunning impact on viewers by appearing in the song \"RUM & WHISKY\".Finally, Vicky Donor is just like sperms, tiny but very effective and gives birth to a new idea in entertainment. With genuineness in script and rigorous performances by leading actors, Vicky Donor is successful in making a strong ascendancy in small budget films. Try not to miss this one.",

            "content": "It turned out to be pleasant surprize form Vicky Donor. While I waited for one week for the reviews before confirming if the movie is watchable, the movie stood tall in all aspects. Anu Kapoor is back with a bang with some impressive performances by Ayushman and Yami. The movie provided the right perspective to look at sperm donation and its importance. Though the conservatives with frown at such issues, even from the entertainment point of view, the movie provides everything that audience expects from a movie. The punches are spot on in terms of timing as well as dialogs. While a majority of the dialogs are in Punjabi (which might repel certain set of audiences), it just improves the originality of the plot. Music has been another highlight of the movie with the song \"Paani Da Rang\" being the masterpiece. Overall, a good 2-3 times watch.",

            "content": "I don't like Bollywood cinema, it has just never appealed to me and therefore I tend to avoid such movies like anything with Tom Cruise.I found myself watching Vicky Donor as it's supposed to be an Indian remake of the excellent French Canadian movie Starbuck (2011). I'll say right off the bat, it's not............it really really isn't and they need to stop making that claim.A very high rated Indian movie it tells the story of a lovable loser type who reluctantly begins donating sperm. He hides it from his family and the woman he loves because for some reason it would bring great shame.That's it, so again this is not Starbucks plot at all despite being advertised as such.It has most of the Bollywood tropes but thankfully no sudden dance numbers, I really couldn't have sat through it if there had been. There is however a heavy soundtrack and in this guys view it damaged the film.The soundtrack grinds, the characters certainly could have been more likeable and much of the film feels like a melodrama more than anything else.However on the flipside some of the writing is excellent, the plot though simple is handled well and the finale really saved the movie.Vicky Donor is not Starbuck but it has it's own identity and for a guy who hates Bollywood I can't deny that it certainly has its moments.Vicky Donor is an enjoyable affair despite its flaws.The Good:Yami GautamSome of the script is exceptionalGreat finaleThe Bad:Randomly shifting back and forth between languages mid conversationFrustrating soundtrackNot even remotely the Starbuck storyJokes tend to miss their markThings I Learnt From This Movie:When a movie starts with the fact it was created by the \"Eros\" network it makes a person pause and recheck they have the right film!Indians talk so fast it can make subtitles a chore at timesIf \"God\" wanted you to have a child surely you wouldn't be infertileShaking hands with someone after they've made a sperm donation seems like a bad callThe word \"Coming\" was used a suspicious amount in this film, intentional?!Banks allow their employees to go in after hours to mope dramaticallyA person who refers to everyone as sperm would likely not be on my speed dial",

            "content": "\"The best things in life come in small packages..\" This adage came to my mind when I stepped out after watching 'Vicky Donor'.. Easily the best socially relevant comedy made in recent times, this one needs to be appreciated for its natural wit & intelligence in dealing with a sensitive issue in a non-preachy way. The movie manages to entertain as well as enlighten, & thats' a rare feat in context of Hindi Cinema. The movie succeeds in driving home its point in a subtle manner. Newcomer \"Ayush-Man\" is a complete natural in his roguishly charming Delhi guy act, while fellow d\u00e9butante Yaami Gautam has extremely likable screen presence & is a competent performer as well. As a pair, both of them have a great on-screen chemistry, & their romantic track blends well with the story. On the other hand, every member of the supporting cast is an absolute delight to watch, especially Anu Kapoor as \"Doctor Fertility\". The music is also quite good, with \"Paani Da Rang...\" being the best pick with its soothing composition. There is some emotional drama in the 2nd half & the culmination is arguably convenient, yet it suits the \"feel-good\" tone of the film. Overall, this is a crisply entertaining movie with a BIG heart. Highly recommended for lovers of good cinema, & a welcome break from all the crude slapstick \"comedies\" that are regularly dished out at the Indian Box Office in the name of entertainment. A complete surprise package!",

            "content": "Very Recently I had an argument with a friend when i asked him that out of the two movies released this Friday which would be given preference bu him. He said and I'd quote that \"(It's a)disgrace that people can actually watch this\".No offence but Vicky Donor would be like a slap on the face for such people. It is fresh, entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable.Starring Ayushmann Khurrana as the Punjabi munda Vicky who doesn't have a job of his own and is constantly nagged by his mother played by Dolly Alluwalia. His grandma, on the other hand as Vicky himself says pretty modern and very supportive. All's not well for him until Dr.Baldev Chadda played by Annu Kapoor finds out that Vicky can be an excellent sperm donor. Midway he falls in love with Ashima Roy(Yami Gautam) and the story carries on further.The interesting part about Vicky Donor is that although the film preaches the topic of sperm donation at no point does the film uses vulgarity or cheap humour to carry it along. The music is very catchy at the least and songs like 'Paani da' and 'Rum whisky' really help to keep up the tempo of the movie.The screenplay by Juhi Chaturvedi is apt and even the 2 hr 15 min doesn't seem too long.Yes the dialogues are a bit repetitive, the story a bit sluggish in parts but the good acting performances by the entire cast hide the negatives more or less. Annu Kapoor, Dolly and her mother-in-law impress in particular. Ayushmann has very good screen presence and Yami looks superb.It's a definite thumbs up from my side for Shoojit Sircar's Vicky Donor. You should not give this a miss if possible.3/5",

Thank God I did. From the first scene to the last, it was worth it.A great script dealing with masturbation indirectly yet without any vulgarity in words or scenes. It will easily pass off as a 'modern' family entertainer. It is not easy to bring out the film in such a great script and kudos to the director and editors for sending out a altogether new message and getting it out from the actors. All the actors were spot on. But a special mention to the mom and her in-law, and their on screen chemistry. The leads have also done well, but Annu kapoor is the class act. Then final scene in which he breaks- down laughing, makes him in the list of my great actors in India. No unnecessary songs,long shots, close-ups, drama etc,. it was all just about perfect. There were some pit falls on the acting in some scenes of Anshuman and Yaani, but come'on the made up for it later. All together a great movie, coming in the times of Kahaani, Paan Singh Tomar etc,. only shows that this might be India's turn to its greatest star ever- The Script.Rush and watch!!!",

Vicky Donor injects a new age career (if you may call it) of donating sperms in to the life of a happy, cricket loving, 25 but jobless Delhi boy Vicky (Ayushmann Khurrana). After Dr. Baldev Chaddha, (Annu Kapoor) an infertility specialist overtly chases Vicky for this covert job; he begins to enjoy the perks that come along with the job. However with great perks come great pains. Great perks \u2013 money, job, girlfriend (incidental to the job) and respect from his family. Great Pains \u2013 Not being able to tell his family and girlfriend about his career. So do the perks outweigh the pains? Or life is beyond such naive comparisons? For the answers, watch the movie!While you are at it, you will be treated to some delightful real life characters, Kamlesh Gill as Vicky's alcohol-loving, forward-thinking grandma, Dolly Ahluwalia as Vicky's alcohol-loving, loud and dutiful mother, Annu Kapoor the singularly focused Dr. Baldev Chaddha, the beautiful Ashima Roy (Yami Gautam) and her oh-so Bengali family. The banter between Kamlesh Gill and Dolly Ahluwalia, Annu Kapoor's character who sees life through the lens of sperms will keep you chuckling through the movie. You will want to cheer the celebration of differences and the eventual mingling between the Punjabis and the Bengalis, brought to the fore in the wedding sequence.Is this Ayushmaan's debut? Wow! Doesn't seem like that! He comes across as completely natural and never seems anything besides Vicky! He is absolutely lovable as the boy next door. Annu Kapoor is scintillating. He amuses you and makes you laugh. Kamlesh Gill and Dolly Ahluwalia are uncontainable. Debutant Yami Gautam looks delectable and performs well. Juhi Chaturvedi's very believable story has a thoroughly enjoyable screenplay where witty one-liners are the order of the day. Kamaljit Negi's cinematography is good. Shekhar Prajapati's snips ensure the movie never slows down. Abhishek-Akshay's music carries the narration forward while Rum Whiskey will be a party smasher!Director Shoojit Sircar after a hiatus of 7 years (Yahaan 2005) deftly blends in a topical story with some endearing characters and real life sequences to dish out a delightful slice of life film!

His props, clinic and the hand gesture (just loved it) are just amazing! I am forced to wonder why is he not more visible on screen! Ayushman is a complete natural as a punjabi boy. Not for one moment would you even feel this is his debut in bollywood. Yami Gautam is gorgeous and appears very soothing to the eye. The modern grandmother and mum have been excellently portrayed by the respective actors. This is perhaps first time in bollywood that you have a saas-bahu and daaru scene! Two characters that really stand out throughout the movie are undoubtedly Dr Chaddhha and the grandmother! A must watch for everyone",

            "review_title": "Revival of the old glory days",
            "content": "What a lovely story this film is. It starts off a little bland - we see a rather aimless guy who we don't immediately sympathise with and the entire sperm donation track is too quick to ring true. Indeed, it takes time to pick up, but when it does, it does so with unusual panache, humour and heart, and there's no looking back. The love story between the male lead and his love interest turns out much more affecting that one would imagine given the light tone that precedes it.Vicky Donor is one of those films which revive an old middle-of-the-road style, very reminiscent of the style of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee classics, by bringing back a much-missed energy of simplicity to mainstream Hindi cinema, very real and authentic, with great dialogue, lifelike situations, smart comedy based on the tiniest nuances, and above all, celebration of the Indian culture and lifestyle, particularly among middle-class families.One of the film's most entertaining sequences happens when the lead pair decide to get married. Cultural and communal differences soon arise among their Punjabi and Bengali families in the form of vocal recycling of the most familiar of ethnic stereotypes by each sectorial group against the other. This part of the film is written with such wit and affection for each community that it becomes much more than just a comic commentary on prejudice.This part is greatly played by the wonderful character actors. Obviously, Dolly Ahluwalia is stupendous throughout, bringing layers and credibility to what could have been a caricature. The same is true of Kamlesh Gill, who is amazingly authentic as the playful grandmother, who might be the oldest in the house but by far the worldliest and less bigoted. In smaller parts, Jayant Das is hilarious as the Bengali father and Swaroopa Ghosh is effective as his sister.The film naturally belongs to the brilliant Ayushmann Khurrana, who was a promising new find then, and today it's clear to what extent. Yami Gautam is luminous. Her delicate, angelic beauty along with her radiant screen presence make her a most convincing love interest even if acting-wise she could have been a little better. Doubtlessly, the driving force of this film is Annu Kapoor as the fertility expert in a wonderfully transformative comic act.The film's seemingly main theme of sperm donation is revealed to be no more than a nice gimmick or, at most, a recurring comic motif which infuses the film with symbolic heft. What lies at the heart of this film though is the romance, which culminates in a phenomenal musical number, \"Pani Da Rang\", sung beautifully by Khurrana himself. Sadly, there are flaws, including some poor dubbing and predictable moments. But Vicky Donor remains fresh and interesting.",

They tend to grow apart but that does not happen thanks to Doctors last stunt.The two elements that hold this movie are humorous Science and humane emotions. The clingy nature of Doctor for the benefit that includes Science somewhere in form of screen presence is tremendous to watch. How the events turn out for Vicky and Ashima, despite she being infertile is a success that every member in audience enjoys.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The direction given by Shoojit Sircar is best in my opinion.

            "content": "First of all I would like to congratulate John Abraham to back & produce a film on such an off-track subject which is usually not supported by the producer community. I have always believed that after becoming hugely successful in your own field, it's the duty of a person to support some good & meaningful projects which otherwise don't get any approval from the fearful Industry. And with VICKY DONOR, John fulfills his duty in an impressive manner, without featuring in it in the lead role and giving a much deserving chance to the talented cast.Secondly (as said earlier in a review), the film once again proves that 'An Enjoyable, Must See Movie' solely depends upon Writing, Writing & Writing alone. So the next set of wishes goes to both the director Shoojit Sircar and the screenplay-dialogue writer Juhi Chaturvedi for making a thoroughly enjoyable film offering many hilarious and thoughtful sequences with many well written lines right till the end. They both not only convert a serious subject of artificial insemination into an entertaining comic one but at the same time also retain the optimistic feel of the issue in a splendid manner. Moreover they also meet another requisite of Good Cinema in which movies should both entertain and enlighten the viewers about some rare issues of the society. And VICKY DONOR being a comic take will surely enlighten many more viewers of the country about this available medical technique, who might not be aware of it till now with a clear vision.Third are the fabulous performances in the movie from its entire talented start cast interacting beautifully. Actually the magic behind their great acts lies in the notable characterizations of their respective roles written realistically by Juhi. Ayushmann will surprise many in the industry with his completely natural, confident and captivating performance in the lead role of a sperm donor. And he really bowled me over with the way he speaks Punjabi in the film in a flawless style. Frankly there has to be someone behind that undoubtedly.Annu Kapoor once again proves the exceptional talent he has in his outstanding portrayal of an Artificial Insemination Specialist Doctor operating from a small office in Daryaganj. His act readily proves that he is unarguably one of the most under-rated & under-utilised veteran actors of Bollywood till date. Yami Gautam acts well and looks stunning on the screen as never before. In fact after a long time I felt like witnessing a character on the screen with whom the viewer can easily fall in love instantly. She adds both glamour as well as sensitivity to the project impressively and this is sure going to fetch her many more reputed projects soon.Jayanta Das as Yami's father and the actress playing her aunt suit their roles perfectly. But one of the major appealing points of the film remain Dolly Ahluwalia and Kamlesh Gill who play Ayushmann's mother and grandmother respectively. The two ladies are truly the scene-stealers here with their funky dialogues and great face expressions. Especially when they both are talking about their past experiences in a drunkard state and while dancing in the marriage sequences. The viewers are positively going to talk about them first while walking out of the hall before any other actor.Musically VICKY DONOR gets ample support from two fine tracks played repeatedly in the film namely, \"Rum Whiskey\" and \"Pani Da Rang\". John makes a friendly experience in \"Rum Whiskey\" played in the end credits and \"Pani Da Rang\" gels well with the story progression on the screen which is composed, written and sung by the lead hero Ayushmaan himself. The background score supports the comic feel of the film perfectly and cinematography is fine capturing the Delhi ambiance in a realistic mode once again.Besides, taking a clue from its promotional campaign on various channels, VICKY DONOR might appear to you as a rare comedy made on an off-beat sexual subject. But clearing this misconception I would like to reveal that along with being a hilarious take on the serious subject in its first half, VD is a great romantic film with heartfelt emotions in its later part. In true words, I would like to rate it amongst the best romantic films made in Bollywood which not only talks about an inter- caste marriage between a Punjabi & Bengali but which also revolves around a thoughtful subject of artificial insemination written brilliantly with some great comic touches and a fantastic climax.VICKY DONOR also goes into the list of those well made successful movies which take huge support from Punjabi language and Delhi's famous Punjabi Mohalla vibes for its entertaining script. Though frankly I don't support the way the makers show the Punjabi ladies abusing and drinking heavily as if that's a part of their daily routine. But still taking the reference on a lighter note, I would strongly like to recommend VICKY DONOR to all my readers here who wish to see something fresh coming from our own loving Bollywood. Especially the friends coming from Bengali and Punjabi origin, as they would all surely enjoy watching this thoughtful realistic comedy more than anybody else.Ending with a strange question, which was also pointed out in a scene in the film, I would like to ask that if all the Palmists (the palm-lines readers) can tell how many children one has by looking at the lines on the palm, then how will they come to know about the children of a Sperm Donor whose sperm has been used by so many families?",

            "review_title": "This Donor generous with laughs and heart...",
            "content": "This afternoon I watched \"Vicky Donor\" and was unexpectedly enchanted by it. The title and the recent spate of unfunny sex \"comedies\" had made me apprehensive, but this sweet film disarmed me completely. Of course, it is about a sperm donor, but it so cleverly involves the viewer in the lives of said donor and the people in his world, that one gets emotionally invested in their destinies instead of staying a Peeping Tom voyeur. Rather than titillating and going for cheap laughs, the tale of the donor and his circumstances is unspooled deftly to the point that he emerges as a kind of selfless do-gooder. The laughs that arise are from situational humor rather than the tacky nudge-nudge-wink-wink variety. Although not totally new, the dialogue is laugh-out loud funny. We've already been introduced to the outlandish vernacular in \"Band Baaja Baaraat\", \"Do Dooni Chaar\" \"Ladies v/s Ricky Bahl\" and other films set in that peculiar Punjabi Delhi milieu. In fact, a new film genre was spawned in the past few years: the middle class Delhi family comedy.The cast is first rate, and again a director shrewdly deploys the best of Delhi's theatre talents in the service of an off-beat film. Most of these actors would be unknown to Hindi filmgoers who would think them to be overnight sensations; the fact is most of them paid their dues and honed their craft on the stages of Delhi and Calcutta for decades. Kamlesh Gill, as the titular donor's grandmother is a scene stealer with her progressive views, uncharacteristic knowledge of electronic gadgets and nightly peg or two. At one point, her movie grandson remarks admiringly that Delhi has only two truly modern things: the newly-built Metro and his grandmother. Ms. Gill has been active in theatre since 1957! In the film, her drinking partner is her widowed daughter-in-law, Vicky's mother, played with feisty brio by another theatre professional and National Award-winning costume designer Dolly Ahluwalia Tewari.Spectacularly beautiful and talented TV actress Yami Gautam is Vicky's love interest Ashima Roy, while her widower father and spinster aunt are played appealingly, once again, by longtime theatre veterans: Jayant Das and Swaroopa Ghosh. With this wealth of combined acting expertise, it's no surprise that they succeed brilliantly in creating the compellingly real world of Vicky, Ashima, their families, and the man who upends their happy, orderly lives: the infertility expert Dr. Baldev Chaddha, played to perfection by Annu Kapoor. Dr. Chaddha has long been on a quest for the ideal sperm donor, and when he comes across carefree cricket-mad Vicky, he sizes him up and then pretty much stalks him until the young man becomes his star performer.The title role is played by a TV anchor/VJ Ayushmaan Khurana, who understands that Vicky has to be an everyday schmo with nothing heroic to distinguish him from the hordes of similar unemployed slacker youths that populate present-day Delhi. Only Dr. Chaddha spots his potential, such as it is, and launches Vicky's fruitful if, um, single-handed success. These two and their humorous bickering mutual need-and-greed relationship are at the centre of the film. Chaddha is a cunning combination of fast-talking hustler, shameless (hence, very funny) mercenary, and ultimately, unlikely altruist, and the gifted Annu Kapoor makes him amusingly disreputable, but never sleazy. Chaddha genuinely sees Vicky as a walking-talking, revenue generating sperm bank, and after each encounter with the young man muses to himself \"Confused sperm!\", \"Unpredictable sperm!\" or \"Pain in the sperm!\" depending on the outcome of each exchange. It is excellent that Annu Kapoor has returned to Hindi cinema after a long self-imposed exile. He was a hoot in last year's \"7 Khoon Maaf\", and pulls off a funny yet heart-warming turn in this film.When Vicky and Ashima decide to make a life together, it brings into hilarious play a Punjabi-Bengali culture clash. In the initial meetings, each side has catty put downs of the other, yet when all is said and done, they are so large-hearted and accepting that they promptly settle into an amiable harmony, complete with affectionate leg-pulling. The wedding with mix-and-match Punjabi and Bengali rituals and customs is an inspired piece of business: the Punjabis are spooked by a posse of loudly ululating Bengali matrons, but only for an instant. They give the well-behaved ladies an impromptu Bhangra lesson and have them all balle-balle-ing with new-found abandon. Vicky's grandma and mom get Ashima's teetotal dad drunk, but the real intoxication is from pure joy.Alas, the truth will and does out, and Ashima goes ballistic when she discovers Vicky's donor past. Will they be able to settle differences and overcome what Ashima perceives as a colossal breach of trust? I am going to stay mum on this - for you really should find out for yourselves.I'm impressed that John Abraham had the acumen to spot the potential in this unconventional project and made it his first producing effort. Kudos to Juhi Chaturvedi who penned a highly original story, screenplay and dialogue, and got the flavours and nuances of Punjabi-centric Delhi and Anglophile Calcutta just right. Shoojit Sircar directs with a light, but ever observant touch, and makes his large cast people you care about. Ayushmaan Khurana doesn't possess movie-star looks but his delightful, ingratiating personality and confidence should compensate abundantly. Yami Gautam is a classic Indian beauty and manages to takes one's breath away in simple every-day clothing - I can't wait to see the results when Manish Malhotra gets his designing hands on her in the Yash Raj extravaganzas that are bound to follow - and she's a good actress, to boot. This intelligent, generous, warm-hearted take on sperm donation does indeed, as its tagline naughtily promises, make every drop count!",

            "content": "With the passage of time audience have seen that the cinema has changed. I would call it a 360 degree change. There were times when action flicks used to be the talk of the town. There used to be an angry young man beating up the goons either for the sake of vengeance or for proving his macho character. Then there were times when love stories were liked by budding lovers and college sweet-hearts, those movies used to have some great music compositions which were instantly liked and loved by the listeners (of that time). Now weird (for some people) and interesting (for other viewers) movies are made. At some circles slapstick comedies are encouraged and on the other hand people are also appreciating thought provoking cinema. This particular movie, \"Vicky Donor\" is a combination of both.The movie might not get success, on the basis of its topic, screenplay and concept, if it would have been released in 90's or even in 2000's. Audience is much more ready to accept things nowadays. The movie is tale of a Punjabi boy named Vicky Arora (Ayushman) whose great grandfather had 19 children. This story also revolves around a (not so successful) middle aged Doctor Baldev Chadda (Annu Kapoor) who specializes in infertility operations and he runs a fertility clinic and looking for a sperm donor. Last but not the least, this movie also revolves around the love of a Punjabi guy with a Bengali girl Ashima Roy (Yaami Gautam) and their trust and understanding.The theme of the movie is really interesting yet controversial, for some. Dr. Chadda convinces Vicky to donate his sperm so that he can give happiness to those parents who are not blessed with their biological kids. For this he quotes some factual yet hilarious examples to Vicky, regarding Mahabhaarat's time. Finally Dr. Chadda convinces Vicky and he starts to donate sperms. The sequence between Annu Kapoor (as Dr. Chadda) and Ayushmaan (as Vicky) are amazingly hilarious and here definitely Annu Kapoor being a veteran actor takes the audience to the heights of laughter. It is not easy to share the screen with Annu Kapoor but Ayushmaan makes his presence noticed strongly. They both complement each other in almost every scene be it be dramatic or funny. Those who know the roles portrayed by Annu Kapoor in his career will never doubt that he has a caliber that is not shared by many actors. Be it his \"Gali Gali Chor hai\" or \"7 Khoon Maaf\" both roles portrays huge contrast. For those who really want to see his amazing performance must watch \"Ek Ruka hua faisla\" (21 years old young Annu Kapoor portraying a 59 years old lawyer).On the other hand (d\u00e9butant) Ayushman is also full of surprises. He performs extremely nice as a funky, easy going and smart ass boy at one place, whereas he astonishes audience in climax (I don't want to spoil the experience \u2013 watch it yourself). Be it a serious thing or comical the young talent has the potential to get noticed. Yaami Gautam is a well known name of Indian TV Channels but she debuts in this movie and guys will love her charms and sweetness. She does not portray an \"Oh So Sexy\" role but even then am sure guys will smile after watching her and noticing her simplicity. She can go a long way provided she chooses right roles.There are other characters that shine in this movie, including, Vicky's mom (Dolly Ahluwalia) and grand mom (Kamlesh Gill). Jayanta Das, portraying the father of Yaami Gautam, excels brilliantly.On the whole, John Abraham has managed to produce a great piece of funny and witty cinema. The movie shares a nice plot line, if we can save a dying man by donating our blood, why can't we grant our sperms to grant a whole life to someone who does not even exists in the world. The good things about this movie are that it has freshness, good humor, some great performances and a nice handling. Only drawback \u2013 it lacks star power (which these days is a must for many movie goers).Music is average, dialogues are hilarious and direction is promising.",

            "content": "Vicky Donor was a complete different movie with a beautiful message .Dr.Baldev Chadda has a fertility chamber in the midst of New Delhi where he helps infertile parents to have their own child with help of sperm donors. However, he is running out business as his clients are not satisfied with his sperm donors. Dr. must find a healthy donor with good family history to run the show. Enter Vicky Arora, a street-smart, smooth-talker chap who has no job and is dependent on income from his mother's beauty parlor. Dr. Baldev Chadda is impressed with his ancestral background and must convince him to donate sperms in order to save his business and Vicky must find a good way to earn some bucks. Shoojit Sircar (Yahaan) goes a complete different way and chunks out a very hard hitting yet very delightful movie with a lovely message in the end. It takes guts to direct a film of this stature and at the same time make it entertaining. Hats off to the director for trying out something out of box and give us a heart-warming and touching movie. The script holds your attention right from the beginning till the end. The story is superb considering to be one of its kind in Bollywood. Coming to performances, Annu Kapoor steals the thunder. The actor is superb in the role of Dr. Baldev Chaddha. One of the hilarious scene is where he explains the process of formation of egg in a female body. Ayushmann Khuranna is amazing as a first time actor. The actor plays the role of Vicky with conviction. Special mention for his tuneful compilation of the song \"Panni Da rang \" which he has sung and written as well. Yami Gautam surprises with her acting. She gets the ample scope to display her talent in the 2nd half. Dolly Ahluwalia and Kamlesh Gill are outstanding as the mother and grandmother of Vicky. Vicky Donor promises and delivers the way it was shown in the trailer \u2013 hilarious. I am happy with the way Bollywood directors are doing things differently and thinking out of the box. This one is sure to keep you entertained and at the same time gives a beautiful message \u2013 If there can be blood donors to save life , why can't there be sperm donors to give new lease of life !!!

            "content": "\"Vicky Donor\" highlights a relevant subject concerning modern society. Due to the stressful and career oriented modern life, many couples are having problems to conceive and have babies. For the problem, sperm donation has been shown as an alternative in this witty romantic comedy. Still our society isn't ready for sperm donation which is seen as a taboo. There is no harm in such practice and is a boon to the couples who are unable to conceive.The protagonist of the film is a jobless youth, who pressurized by a doctor in the infertility clinic, starts to secretly donate his sperm for raising money. The revelation of the truth brings turmoil in his family and love life which is resolved by the doctor of the infertility clinic himself. Undoubtedly, the subject of the film is novel and deserves a big applaud which suggests a solution for a social problem. However, the light treatment of the subject, slack narrative, and glibness with which things are resolved don't leave much of the impact.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",

            "content": "Vicky Arora (Ayushmann Khurana) is an aimless and jobless Delhi boy. He is persuaded by Dr Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), an infertility clinic owner to become a sperm donor that could help childless couples. After much resistance, he finally agrees to the act to earn some easy money. Soon he makes a fortune out of his potent attribute. He also marries the love of his life Ashima (Yaami Gautam) but things take a drastic turn when she comes to know about his covert contributions to the sperm bank.Vicky Donor comes with a fresh story. Call it a love story on the backdrop of sperm donation or a film about sperm donation with a love story within - the writing by Juhi Chaturvedi seamlessly integrates the two elements to come up with a wholesome entertainer. Further director Shoojit Sircar flawlessly catches the pulse of Delhi and the drama in the narrative.While the film lightly touches on the theme of the shortage of sperm donors and the social stigma attached to the act (unlike blood or organ donations), it intentionally refrains from being an issue-based cinema. Vicky's initial opposition to the idea aptly brings out the average apprehensions and his consequent consent reveals the monetary motives behind the act.The love story between the lead pair that starts off on a flirtatious note but soon translates into an amiable affair, brings a sublime smile on your face throughout. The romance is refreshing and the chemistry between the couple is hot-n-happening. Soon the love affair of the cross-cultural couple gets into the 'Two States' zone. The film takes an unapologetic look at the culture characteristics (or call it clich\u00e9s) of the Punjabi boy and Bengali girl and the divergent divide expressed in the sequence of scenes that lead to their matrimony is absolutely uproarious.But beyond having a splendid sense of humour, the film also has a very poignant side to it. The fact that Vicky's fervent fertility isn't of any productive use to himself is where the film defines a strong contrasting conflict in the narrative. Since the couple's camaraderie was so sizzling, you feel the pinch as they part ways. Further Sircar successfully defines and distinguishes emotions, elucidating how the point of marital discord between the couple is not merely mistrust but insecurity. The climax comes across as convenient though isn't unconvincing.The pacing is fast and the multiple-montage crisp editing never lets you lose the narrative. The dialogues vary from the quirky to the well- worded conversations and contribute immensely to the humour quotient. The music is peppy and goes smoothly with the flow of the film.Vicky Donor is what it is primarily for the livewire energy of Vicky played by Ayushmann Khurana. The actor is so natural that it never seems he's acting but rather gliding through the role. He is a pro at both the comedy and emotional scenes. Given the right roles, Ayushmann has the potential to be the next big thing in Bollywood. Yaami Gautam is absolutely ravishing and captivates with her unending charm. The beauty also reflects in her performance. The supporting cast is blessed with quirky yet relatable characterizations. Annu Kapoor as the desperate doctor is brilliant and incites most laughs. Dolly Ahluwalia as the hyperactive Punjabi mother is superlative and such a pleasant change from the regular prototypes. Kamlesh Gill as the modern grandma who shares a drink with her daughter-in-law and aspires for iphones and LED TVs is another fabulous characterization and a fantabulous actor. Jayanta Das as the girl's Bengali father is as much amusing.",

            "review_title": "Why 8 or 9 out of 10????!!!!!",
            "content": "As I am writing this, about 5000 people have rated this film; 25% of them have rated it a 10. 50% of them have rated it a 9 or 8 and the remaining 25% have rated it a 7 or less. I am not going to even bother with the bottom 25% - they exist to make life interesting and adventurous. The top 25%: glad you got it. The remaining 50% who rated it 8 or 9 - I ask you this humbly and earnestly: Why? Lets look at the film as objectively as in my opinion, I can. The script of the film is excellent; no major glitches, hardly any minor ones, respect for the audience's intelligence, very authentic (if you happen to be familiar with the Delhi milieu, you will surely agree), multi-dimensional characters, 3 complete acts, extremely good dialogues. Technically, as in cinematography, production design, art direction, sound, sfx, it has limited scope due to the script, but within that limited scope, very competent. The editing could perhaps have chopped off about 1-2 minutes in the pre-climax when there is a conflict in the protagonists' lives. The music is very apt for the tone and flow of the film, Paani Da Rang being my personal favourite. Very ably directed by Soojit Sircar. He had a fantastic script to work with and his genius was in adhering to it. He has also done a brilliant job in his choice of actors. Ayushman Khurana, Anu Kapoor, Yami Gautam and Dolly Ahluwalia are the principal characters who have all done a fabulous job. But the diligence of Sircar lies in his choice of his supporting cast. There are at least another 20 speaking characters in the film and their competent characterization in writing and performing lends tremendous credibility to the film. From a financial standpoint, the film was made on a very reasonable budget (Rs. 5 crore as per wikipedia) and marketed appropriately earning over 9 times the cost (again as per wikipedia). So the producers have done justice to their investors as well as distributors. Great balance of art and commerce.Now, moving on to the heart from the brain, this film in my opinion is phenomenal. It is a great comedy not just for its laugh-off-your-chair moments, but for its numerous bring-a-smile-to-your-face moments and touch-your-heart moments. In the world of films, most of us love categorization as per genres and this would fall into the feel-good comedies section at your DVD store or your online streaming website. And we are unfortunately programmed to think that feel-good is not worthy of a 10. There should be some larger-than-life greatness or a very grand idea about how to make the world a better place for a movie to be rated a 10. I will just say this: (aside from the fact that as a healthy father married to the healthy mother of our healthy 8 month old grace from God baby girl, I balled my eyes out at the end of this 2 hour joyful bliss) Hrishikesh Mukherjee would have been very proud of Shoojit Sircar. Definitely the best of 2012 thus far.",

            "review_title": "Vicky Donor : Clinging on to Reality",
            "content": "A month ago when I first saw the trailer of Vicky Donor, I was outright shocked - had the limit of vulgarity been crossed that Bollywood was now making movies on sperm donors!! Finally when I decided to see it post hearing some rave reviews I had difficulty telling my folks that I am going for a film like Vicky Donor - obviously a crude Punjabi sex comedy.Except I couldn't have been more wrong and pleasantly surprised by what might just not be the best film this year but a landmark film in general. Just about everything in the film was not just good it was damn perfect.So, as the story goes Vicky Arora (Anshuman Khurana) is your average Punjabi Delhi boy (a character type way too visible in almost every next film these days) His paths cross with a desperate Dr. Chaddha (Annu Kapoor) \u2013 a fertility specialist who is obsessed with good quality sperm. Dr. Chaddha's clinic is under threat as most of the sperms in his sperm bank are not up to the mark and can't deliver the \"goods\".The first half of the film is primarily driven by Dr. Chaddha trying to convince Vicky to become a paid donor as his sperms result showcase him as having the highest fertility and motility rates. At the same time, Vicky is also trying to woo a hot Bengali banker Ashima in his typical Delhi Punjabi Boy style. There are also other interesting characters like Vicky's mother Dolly who runs a beauty parlour and Ashima's English speaking stereotypical \"bong\" father.It is unsaid there are three things that work flawlessly for the film \u2013 the first is the screen writing. From the story to the dialogues to the way this difficult topic is laid out \u2013 it is an almost perfect script. Juhi Chaturvedi the writer has to be for Vicky Donor what Amit Trivedi was to Dev D. Without her writing this would never have been the film it turns out. It would have been tempting to convert this story into a long series of sex jokes what with the central topic being sperm. As a matter of fact, in the hands of commercialized Bolllywood it would have become just that (one can imagine a Sajid khan overfilling it with sex jokes and laughing himself the loudest)Except that the screenplay just does not allow that. There is hardly a joke in the film which would qualify as toiler humor \u2013 a masterstroke as it not only makes the story credible but also allows it to have a smart social message. The credit goes to the dialogues and situations. From the Bengali \u2013 North Indian wedding which was so apt (since I myself underwent one recently) to the second half where the protagonists face a personal challenge - the script is plain brilliant!! The second point which stands out and practically runs Vicky donor are the performances. Annu Kapoor has always been an exceptional actor from his Tezaab days but in Vicky Donor he is touching a new high. You know he hits home when one ends up understanding his frustration of trying to explain to people that sperm donation is not a dirty profession but the need of the hour almost like a social service. The other standout performance is of Anshuman Khurana as Vicky. The cheesy oneliners he uses to woo Ashima would have been PJs in the hands of any other actor but Anshuman delivers them with the perfect tilt of head. Not to mention his well handled moments of poignancy in the second half of the film.Again Dolly Ahluwalia as the cribbing mom and Kamlesh Gill as her super cool mom in law / Vicky's grandmother stand out. One actually looks forward to their scenes in the films. In one particular scene - 50 yr + traditionally clad mother and mom in law are having their daily drinks \u2013 in the midst of it all - the mother in law gets emotional about Dolly not getting any dowry. This hilarious and continuous check on reality makes this film a pleasure to watch.The third point that stands out is the editing - at exactly 2 hours, Vicky Donor makes for an enjoyable 120 minutes, no time is wasted on anything which does not add value to the script. Even a romantic evening out for the couple ends in a revelation which is that check of reality the film keeps subtlety bringing about.The slice of life comedy with an emotional social message genre has seen the Munnabhai movies and 3 idiots as the best entries so far. Vicky Donor is a wonderful addition to this genre and makes it all the more relevant and believable.Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone who likes to watch entertaining cinema and yet not leave their brains at home. So do go out watch this film and don't forget to tell your parents that you are going for Vicky Donor \u2013 a comedy about sperm donation.",

Then I realised I have been watching too many sensible Hollywood movies, and this kind of romance (read borderline stalking/harassment) is the backbone of Indian cinema romance. And of course yes any jobless shmoe could get a beautiful educated lady to fall for him. Please don't ask any questions. That's how it is. And of course a lady with a bank job would never ask her boyfriend more about his job, than \"business\" and how he has got so much sparetime.\nNow if we wipe all that dirt away, the picture beneath is really beautiful. I enjoyed the movie from the point where Vicky admits he is a sperm donor. I would never have expected Bollywood cinema to make movies like Vicky Donor and Badhaai ho. It's a definite improvement and I love it. Though still quite far away from including sex education in the syllabus, mass media of course is the first step.\nAside from cheesy dialogs like \"without ashima ghar is not ghar\", \"i can't live without her\" etc Ayushmann's performance was really good. I loved the character of Ashima's father. They've taken care not to make characters too one-dimensional. Mr. Chadda's genuine care for Vicky, Ashima's understandable insecurity and Vicky's change of behaviour, to a higher level of maturity is all heartwarming. The final scene is gold.\nI rated it a 6, because although a foray in terms of theme/story, for Bollywood, it seems incapable for them to free from certain shackles of illogical, conventional story arcs.\nSomething, movies like Andhadhun and Kaabil could acheive, starring both actors.",

            "content": "\"Vicky Donor\" is an Indian romantic comedy based on the Canadian movie, \"Starbuck\". It's actually very common for Indian films to be direct remakes of various movies around the world...most often, those of Hollywood.The plot is unusual, as I've usually noticed that Indian films tend to be a bit conservative. However, this one is all about a first-class sperm donor...a guy who apparently produces ejaculates which are extremely motile and viable. Vicky (Ayushmann Khurrana) essentially shots out super-sperm...making him a top contributor to a local clinic. This seems like a blessing, as young Vicky is having trouble finding himself and a career...and now, because of his new job, he's becoming rich! Could this be his big break?! Like Steve Martin once said in \"The Jerk\"...\"I've found my purpose!\". Or, could there be some potential problems that he hasn't foreseen?Unlike some Indian romances I've seen, I was happy to see that Ayushmann Khurrana did not play the usual obnoxious playboy sort (a trope which I think is overused) and he played a very likable sort of guy. His scenes with his love interest, Yami Gautam, are quite enjoyable and sweet. Also unlike many Indian films, this one does not include the usual song and dance numbers...just a few brief musical montages and a song and dance number in the closing credits.I also enjoyed the insight into Indian cultures, as I am not from India nor have even visited the country. Learning how Punjabi folks view and perceive Bengalis and and vice-versa was very interesting. Also, it was surprising to see the very negative stereotypes about sperm donors....something that definitely took me by surprise.So, is the film worth seeing? Absolutely. Thought it's definitely less a comedy than a romance in many ways. And, while it is funny, it certainly isn't a laugh out loud sort of film. This is NOT a complaint...I just want you to know what sort of movie it is. Additionally, you might want to have a few Kleenex handy, as the film is pretty emotional at times.By the way, the DVD for this film is from EROS Video. Like other DVDs I've seen from this company, there are TONS of previews and commercials before the film...none of which you can speed through in order to get to the movie. If possible, try to watch this movie online or from a different company unless you are incredibly patient (which, I am sadly, not).Also, you might notice in the movie that the doctor from the clinic refers to Vicky as coming from the 'Aryan race'. This has nothing to do with fascism but it the name given to the highest castes who once ruled India.",

            "content": "An easily entertaining film that does not demand much from us and leaves us with something to think about. The premise is set when the statement \"Many would have enjoyed parenthood if sperm donors were available\" sets the tone of the movie right upfront and it carries it all through. Shoojit Sircar the director must be applauded for taking a subject that has not been dealt before in our Hindi Cinema and producers like John Abraham should be appreciated for helping the idea become a film.All through the film, the one thing that is so very good is the chemistry between the actors. Especially the camaraderie or chemistry of Dr.Baldev Chaddha (played superbly by Annu Kapoor) and protagonist Vicky Arora (played competently by Ayushmann Khurana) is the one that stands out and stands tall. Annu Kapoor slips into the role so fluidly that Chaddha seems so very obsessed with sperm that we forget that Annu as him, and consider him only as the doctor. When such a novel subject is being filmed and if the subject is a kind of taboo considering that it involves the subject of sex, then there will be a lot of temptation to over hype this. But Shoojit holds it back very well and indeed underplays it with the other digressing points like relationship between Vicky and his grandmother or bringing in a newcomer and beautiful Yamini Gautam as Ashima Roy and builds a beautiful love story. The idea though seem to slip off, it keeps coming back in the form of Chaddha and he fixates himself in Sperm stubbornly. Laughter, fun is derived from many moments of the film and that's the main reason watching this film is effortless and entertaining. Also appreciable is the dialog which does not make us watch it seriously but mostly with a smile on our face. The song \"Paani Da Rang\" which is a wonderful number is used well too. All in all, Shoojit Sircar is a director who made his mark with this film and I hope his endeavors will get bigger and better as he rolls the camera in the future.Happy to have seen this, late though but better late than never to watch a good film. I am going with 3/5 for this. Two points down coz this does not have the repeat value as such. Maybe coz dialogs are too easy to memorize.",

I had heard this movie talks about a certain topic that the society treats as a taboo, and that too an innuedo one. So I was expecting tons of cheap humour that the illiterate audience will laugh over. But it was the other way round. The illiterate audience will be the only one who will not like it.I'm gonna keep it spoiler free: Vicky Donor is a story about a genetically perfect man who has a lot of money but no job. His father is dead, his mother has a small salon and his grandmother just supports whatever he does. A doctor who runs a sperm clinic learns about him and keeps trying to convince him about donating sperms to him in return for a lot of money. In the beginning he refuses but when the doctor keeps stalking him, he finally agrees. And once he gets the money, he decides to donate sperm as frequently as possible. This way he earns a lot, but he can't tell anyone about what he does. Later he marries a woman he loves, but she learns about what he does and leaves him.This film raises questions about the moral ethics that society has created over something that many people really need. Due to the poor sex education that we receive, we are led into believing that sperm bad, sex bad, masturbating bad, and so anyone who does any of this is evil. We don't realise our own scripture, Kamasutra, tells us the importance of all this. And this film was made back in 2012, when these topics was an even bigger taboo than what it is today. In my opinion this film is one of the landmarks which pioneered the society into being more acceptable towards this topic.Another topic that this film raises is that of greed. Vicky clearly didn't want to donate sperms because he thought it is morally wrong to do so. But once he receives the payment, he starts doing it more and more, to the point where it becomes practically a habit. He was not doing it for any opinions, ethics or morals. He was only doing it for the money, even though he had surplus of it. This decision leads to his broken marriage, which is later fixed only after the morals are questioned.The acting of every character is incredible. The comedy scenes are great. I really love the part where Vicky and Ashima describe each other to their parents is something you must look forward to if you haven't watched it. The way they highlight the stereotypes Punjabis and Bengalis believe about each other is hilarious. Also Dr. Chaddha's obsession with sperm is a running joke. He often talks in metaphors of sperm. He also holds a model sperm in his hand whenever he talks.Vicky Donor is one of Bollywood's most underrated films, especially of the early 2010's when films like Delhi Belly and Dev D were being made. I'd put this also in the same category. Ayushmann Khurrana showed with this film that he's here to stay. And I really hope he does.",

            "content": "Film: Vicky Donor Cast: Ayushmann Khurana, Yami Gautam, Annu kapoor Director: Shoojit Sircar Rating: * * * out of 5 Six years after his debut film 'Yahaan' created minor tremors at the box-office and won critics praise, ad filmmaker/ feature director Shoojit Sircar, who also burnt his fingers with the stalled Amitabh Bachchan starrer 'Shoebite,' makes a comeback of sorts on the mainstream screens with the hyper-energetic, charismatically engineered, freshly cast, high-on-attitude film, 'Vicky Donor.' He also managed to pull off a miracle by getting John Abraham to co-produce it along with Eros. 's plot is threadbare but it's heart is in the right place. Vicky Arora (Ayushmann Khurana) is a typical Delhi lad who plays club cricket and looks down on his Mamaji (maternal uncle)who owns a wholesale clothing store. So when offered a job at the long-standing establishment, this lay-a-bout thumps his nose at it saying he prefers to stay unemployed. His mom , Dolly, who runs a beauty parlor in the ground floor of their one story tenement, is not happy about her son's unemployed status but his grandmother is far more supportive of his ambition less pursuits. His other pursuits involve flirting with attractive girls, including his next-door neighbor and several other young woman until his eyes alight on a stunning bank employee, a Bengali and a divorce to boot, Ashima Roy(Yami Gautam). If he has to make an impression on the gal, he needs to find an occupation . Luckily for him, Dr Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), a well qualified fertility expert, who runs a fertility clinic and a sperm bank in Dariyaganj, New Delhi is already in hot pursuit of his sperm. Aryaputra Vicky, who till then has been quite vociferous about spurning Dr Baldev's offer suddenly capitulates, agrees to bite the bullet (without sufficient conviction), and scoop a bounty rich enough to earn him several thousands along with expensive white-goods gifts, enough to take his and his family's lifestyle to another level altogether. And no one is the wiser for it. Whenever queried(all too rarely to be believable), he fobs everyone off by calling himself a handicrafts exporter (pun intended) . His mom and grandma just lap it all up and the seductive banker also becomes more than eager to tie the knot without ever checking on his credentials. So once the honeymoon is over, it becomes discovery time and a rift is foisted on the couple, by the scenarists who prefer to structure even a hatke film like this in traditional tripe.. The rest of the film is devoted to conveniently settling the manufactured dispute and getting the couple together in a happily ever after.The concept from the writer Juhi Chaturvedi, is definitely hatke for a mainstream venture and risqu\u00e9 too, considering that any mention of bodily fluids has not really gone down well with the audiences, previously. Even the sensitively handled 'I am' with ne of it's stories high-lighting sperm-donation and infertility, found it difficult to attract audiences. Infertility and sperm donation is not a laughing matter for most, neither is it something that is openly talked about within the privacy of our homes. So the issue had to be dealt with, in such a manner that the audiences would not shy away from watching it with an open mind. The calculated irreverence, loud attitudinal displays, innuendo-laced duologue's, and blas\u00e9 humor which runs through the film, appears therefore to be calculated to make the audience feel like they are part of a joke-fest. The film is supposedly based on real anecdotes, sourced from Dr Aniruddha Malpani, who pioneered the establishment of infertility clinics and sperm banks in India. The plotting though is far too unimaginative and clich\u00e9d to be acceptable. Ashima is presented as an independent, free-thinking individual who leaves her first husband on the very night of her wedding because he confesses to a past love. Yet, the second time round, she falls plumb for a guy who doesn't even reveal his true occupation, and then uses his past antecedents as a wedge to engineer a separation.Shoojit Sircar's film has more to tell about Punjabi and Bengali cultures than it has, in plot and story. The film is in effect a marvelous study of attitudes and manners, the clashes that take place between two cultures when they are threatened by youthful romance and their coming to terms with modern love and romance which in filmi parlance, triumphs, no matter what! I wouldn't call this film forward thinking but it is educational in a back-handed sort of way and there's no doubt that it has all the ingredients to be uninhibitedly entertaining. The scenario may be faulty but the duologue's more than make-up for that lapse and the impressive performances by all the cast members makes the effort doubly memorable.\"Vicky Donor\" is a first in many ways. It marks John's foray into production, it is VJ Ayushmann Khurrana's first film, Yami Gautam's first Hindi film and music director duo Abhishek-Akshay's first credited music composition for a film. Despite these firsts, the film plays out like a thespian effort. It has loads of attitude, a charmingly pointed dramatic clash of disparate cultures, a movie full of charismatic, superbly poised performances including a brilliant Annu Kapoor, and a musically energised vibrant narrative that makes this largely uneventful, weakly conceptualised rom-com-drama far more worthy of your patronage than the crass 'Housefull 2.'

Keeping with the trend of multiplex cinema, it is made for urban audience who prefer a smart film packed with laughs. And, made on a low budget, first-time producer John Abraham has got it right in the first go; all credit to him for attempting a bold theme!Dr Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor) runs a fertility clinic in Delhi. He has a large client\u00e8le of childless couples who have specific demands of how they wish their children to be. But Chaddha is at a loss as he is unable to find the right sperm donor to meet this demand. One day, he spots Vicky Arora (Ayushman Khurana) and things change. Vicky is a jobless 25-year old happy go lucky Punjabi boy who spends his time playing cricket and hanging around spends his mother's money on shopping. Noticing his good looks and his stress-free lifestyle, Chaddha is sure that he has found his catch. So as to salvage his floundering business, he hounds Vicky and lures him to the job. Although Vicky is initially reluctant, he falls for the money as Chaddha milks him for all his worth. With money comes success, but he can't explain his profession to his widowed mother (Dolly Ahluwalia) who single-handedly runs a beauty parlor or his doting and forward looking grandmother (Kamlesh Gill). Things get further complicated when he finds his love, Ashima Roy (Yami Gautam).The comedy is simply amazing with its outstanding one-liners that had the audience in splits. It could be the way they introduce the subject, or when they portray the characters' inconvenience with it. There is also some inter-regional humor with a Punjabi-Bengali wedding thrown in. Ayushman Khurana, a find from season 2 of MTV roadies had established himself as a popular VJ and television anchor and this is his first tryst with films. Still, he gets into the skin of his character comfortably. He is complemented by Yami Gautam, also making an effective Bollywood debut after a stint on TV and regional cinema. But the film is not just about the lead actors. There is Annu Kapoor who is surely set to win some awards as the supporting actor. Dolly Ahluwalia has done well too. But, Kamlesh Gill has some of the best lines and stands out in a very comic role. Low budget approach is evident in its production design as it hardly has any expensive sets or big stars. Its well written script by Juhi Chaturvedi is its biggest investment and the biggest asset. There is only one bit where the movie falls short of being awesome; the editing. The second half could have done with a bit of snip here and there. The film also has a strong Delhi flavor to it and many lines peppered with Punjabi. That also includes its songs 'Paani Da Rang', 'Mar Jaiyaan', 'Rum Whiskey' which are runaway hits already. For director Shoojit Sarkar, who last made 'Yahaan' a serious movie seven years ago, 'Vicky Donor' is his second film and first ever comedy.Considering its theme, \"Vicky Donor\" obviously carries an 'Adult' rating and the humor may not be palatable to everyone. So, if this ever hits the small screen, most of its best lines could be muted. So, better catch it now when on the big screen.",

That the makers of the movie have succeeded in presenting such a controversial & misunderstood yet medically & legally accepted technique in such a palatable & pleasant manner is an example of excellent film making. It reiterates the fact that conveying a message need not be preachy always.Written by Juhi Chaturvedi & directed by Shoojit Sarkar \"Vicky Donor\" is one of the best movie this year thus far. Both Juhi & Shoojit deserve all the accolades due to them. It is a brilliant piece of writing & very casual & restrained direction that has made the movie so appealing. That the viewer genuinely feels blissful at the end of the movie is a testimony to the duo's brilliance.Even the educated of people do have misconceptions regarding this noble & scientific technique. It is brilliantly put across when not only Vicky's not so educated mother & grandmother misunderstands him but even the highly educated Vicky's wife also has the same level of understanding as them. In the end when she gets to witness the whole bunch of kids , the tears of joy that flows through one's eye is inevitable.The movie is not just education & information. It has comedy , emotions , sparkling & witty dialogs , wonderful acting , soulful music , & above all \"Paani Da rang \". The casual banter between the Bengali & Punjabi families about the stereotypes they have of each other is damn hilarious segment. That the writer is a Punjabi & director Bengali helps. There numerous such hilarious moments in the movie. One more which warrants mention is the sequence in which Vicky goes for his first donation.It is hard think of anyone else other than Ayushmann Khurrana as Vicky. He is brilliant. The effortless manner in which he espouses varied emotions is awesome. He seems to be a natural actor & it is a worthy start. Yami Gautham is yet another stupendous actress that the movie has introduced to Bollywood. She seems to an actress with substance. Annu Kapoor as Dr Chaddha is brilliant. He has used all his experience to optimum use here. All others in supporting cast have done well.Written , sung & composed by Ayushmann \"Paani Da rang\" is an awesome song which is an instant ear-worm. \"Meri Jayeyaan \" is another good number.Kamaljeet Negi is the cinematographer & he has done a good job. Technically also the movie is good.On the whole, \"Vicky donor \" is a brilliant (wonder how many times this word gets repeated in this review..!) attempt which needs to be celebrated & respected.Bottomline : Brilliant (one more time..!!!)4/5",

Shoojit Sircar's - Yahaan ( 2005) was an Intense Drama, which Won Hearts of Hindi Movie buffs like us, but Vicky Donor gets a Standing Ovation.Aayushman Khurana as Vicky Arora is flawless as South Delhi lad with oodles of confidence, attitude,Punjabi choicest words and lovable to core.Dolly Ahluwalia as Vicky's mother Dolly keeps you wanting for more with her typical Lajpatnagar/Karolbagh rantings, fantastic dialogs delivery and hats off to Juhi Chaturvedi as Dialogue writer. She deserves to get National Award for Dialogue writing at least. The storyline is unique and I haven't seen any Hollywood movies in recent years with such a lively topic, which makes so much sense. Yami Gautam is simplistically ravishing and gorgeously fresh. Her wedding bridal make-up or simple Bankers Saree and Black rimmed glasses takes breadth out of you and gives a perfect balance to the hues and colors to otherwise High strung Punjabi drama. Annu Kapoor is the Bard which weaves the story with his mastery Charm, impish comic timings and crooked yet simple delivery of a social message, that Donating sperm is not a stigma, but a Donation for a cause.A must view if you are modern Indian and Bollywood movie lovers. It touches your heart, though ending could have been more message delivering,which could have removed the stigma related to such a bold subject. The story is endearing, Bengali-Punjabi wedding scene is fun and Vicky Donor brings the Simpleness in you, if you enjoy being one rooted to your heart. Human relations has never been so fantastically told in reel with such a Bold subject. Its 10/10 for Shoojit Sircar, Ayushman Khurana, Annu Kapoor, Dolly Ahluwali and Yani Gautam in that order. Hollywood have a look on Modern Indian cinema with Global appeal.",

One oddity: While the punjabis in the movie were shown in full flavor, I felt the Bongs were shown slightly bland (but we all know Bongs are anything but bland). And ironically the director himself is a Bong.Paani da song is a simple, yet very effective song. Great song to be sung and composed by the actor himself.I don't know the background of actors, but I felt no one could have done justice unless someone grew up in Delhi/Punjab/Haryana (like in another such movie I loved: \"Oye Lucky Lucky Oye\"). I am pretty positive the actors were from the region. Smart dialogues, hilarious situations, and finally a powerful social message to cap it off.So glad, movies on such off-topic are being made, and very clear from IMDb review board that its being appreciated so well.

            "content": "Cunning, smart, fast-paced. Those are just some words to describe Vicky Arora and also I'd use the same words to describe this movie. If you like comedies with an actual script and not just over-done slapstick humor (Like the horrible Housefull 2), Vicky Donor is for you. Don't blink an eye because the language is so fast that you may actually miss a clever line.Vicky Arora is an unemployed Punjabi Delhi boy who is tired of seeking a job and also tired of his nagging mother. On the other hand, Dr. Chadda, a man who sees everyone as a sperm, owns a clinic where he runs a \"business\" of sperm donation. However, he just cannot find the right sperm donor with the required qualities. One day he finds Vicky and sees potential in him. After refusing a few times, Vicky finally accepts Chadda's offer once he sees the money coming in. All goes smoothly until Vicky falls in love and gets married. One situation leads to another and Vicky's secret that he's a sperm donor gets out. What happens next, is what Vicky Donor is about.Vicky Donor does not try to be a classic or even a film with a message. It tells a simple story in an extraordinary way. That is what works for the movie. Plus, the characters are all so straight out of life. They're normal people living an ordinary life in Delhi.There a a number of sequences that one ends up loving. The intro of Annu Kapoor in the opening scene is excellent. The whole first half is actually super-entertaining. The scenes when Annu Kapoor tries to convince Vicky to donate keeps you glued. Not to forget the scenes between Vicky's mother and grand-mother - just brilliant.Special mention - Delhi is also a character in the movie. Looks beautiful, I may be biased here since I'm from there.However, my favorite sequences are in the middle when Vicky and Ashima try to convince the culturally diverse parents to let them get married. The two cultures stereotyping each other is hilarious and put a smile on your face.The film has its share of flaws. The fast pace slows down significantly in the latter portions. Also, since the film is set in Delhi, there is a lot of Punjabi spoken in the movie. More than usual. So if you don't know the language, some jokes and words will be hard to get. However, those are very minor blemishes.The writing is intelligent. Dialogue is witty, funny and suits. The screenplay is fresh! Music is a pleasant surprise. Rum Whiskey catches you. Pani da rang is soothing. Peppy and fresh! Shoojit Sarcar is a director to look out for. He's given a brilliant screenplay and does full justice to it.I also want to thank John Abraham for producing this movie and not being the lead hero. He could have easily starred in this one and probably messed it up just as easy.Ayushmann Khurana is a natural talent. He looks the role, suits the role and does a perfect job. Hard to believe it's his first feature film. Yami Gautam has that X factor in her. It shows. She's gorgeous as well.Dolly Ahluwalia and Kamlesh Gill have great chemistry as Vicky's mother and grandmother. They're just so natural. Rest of the cast supports well.Vicky Donor would not be the same without Dr. Baldev Chadda, played so brilliantly by Annu Kapoor. Annu Kapoor is out of this world here. It's his best performance, in my opinion. When he's not on screen, one actually misses the crazy Punjabi Dr. Chadda. Outstanding! Overall - A feel-good film with a sweet message. Recommended!",

Dr. Chadda (Annu Kapoor) is an infertility doctor who gets a lot of business but fails at providing his clients the right sperm. One day he comes across Vicky and realizes he has the perfect sperm due to his family background. Finally, after continuously pestering him, Vicky gives in into Dr. Chadda's ways and decides to donate his sperm... and it turns out to work well with Dr. Chadda's clients. Due to the money he gets, Vicky decides to donate even further. One day, at the bank, he meets Ashima (Yami Gautam), who he instantly likes. They start dating and fall instantly in love. One day they decide to marry each other... and that sort of forms the rest of the film. Whether she will find out and what will happen.When I heard of this film, Im going to be completely honest, I wasn't the slightest bit excited. I knew it was going to be a complete flop when I saw the trailer. When the movie came into cinemas I didn't even think of watching it. But some of my relatives told me a few days later to go watch it and that it would be the best decision I would make. So I was pretty shocked that this movie could be so good so I went to see it. And Im so so so glad I went for it. This movie is the biggest shock I have had so far from the movie industry. IT WAS GREAT! Now I know from the synopsis it sounds totally R rated. Don't worry. 10+ years old can see it. It doesn't show any nudity, it just talks vaguely about it. The movie is about a sperm donor but it just tips the topic lightly.The replay value is a BILLION times. Never gets boring.The acting... WOW. Ayushmann Khurrana, CONGRATULATIONS, you are successfully one of my favorite actors in Bollywood. His acting was marvelous. Enough said. Yami Gautam was pretty good as well. Annu Kapoor, I haven't seen any of his old films but he was really great in this one.The songs are, ALRIGHT. I liked 'Pani Da Rang' by Ayushmann Khurrana and I liked 'Rum & Whisky' played in the end with John Abraham.Overall, this is such a great film. BIG BIG BIG surprise and wow, you should totally see it. The film does drop down a bit in the second half but it holds the laughs, just increases the seriousness although I totally recommend it.",

            "content": "Vicky Donor is an offbeat movie dealing with a \"taboo\" topic of sperm donation. Yes the movie could very easily have moved into vulgar territory, but succeeds in keeping itself light and funny for the most part.Vicky (played effectively by newbie Ayushman) is a typical 25 year old...living for the day, wanting money, clothes, gadgets, and maybe a good job to finance all of these. The beauty parlor run by his widowed mom (Dolly) is his current source of finance, and his mom is \"not amused\". Vicky has a staunch ally in his grandma, a modern, forward-looking woman who loves her alcohol :) Vicky is \"discovered\" as a sperm donor by Dr. Chaddha (an amazingly in-character Annu Kapoor) who is an infertility specialist. Vicky, after his initial hesitation, gets into this \"business\" full time once he realizes how much money he can earn.Things are going smoothly, and Vicky is soon Dr. Chaddha's biggest donor, when Vicky falls in love and gets married to Ashima (Yami) without disclosing his life as a sperm donor. And then Ashima discovers that she cannot have children, and also finds out what Vicky does for a living.And thats when the movie starts going downhill and getting melodramatic. For a so-called modern woman, with an extremely supportive family, Ashima certainly doesn't display any of those modern traits, and becomes an entity alternating between blubbering and yelling. That was kind of irritating, and made me wish that the movie had been better edited and made shorter.Having said that, the movie as a whole is a wonderfully funny movie, with a social message, without being preachy. Ayushman IS Vicky, he's so natural and unforced and believable. He is great at the funny scenes as well as the emotional ones. AND he sings too :). Some of the best scenes in the movie come from the interaction between the mom and the grand-mom. They don't seem to be acting, they seem to inhabit the characters. As for Yami, she's strikingly lovely, but her acting is nowhere in the league of the others. Perhaps her badly written role is responsible for that. Dr. Chaddha is probably Annu Kapoor's best role to date!! The ending is the mandatory happy ending, but it does feel like its been shoehorned in after a focus audience gave the original ending a thumbs-down.All in all...a good movie, worth watching.",

The movie not only proved to be a decent watch but also put forward a social message on the subject of childless parents.A jovial feel throughout, with a good number of laughs describes this movie experience. Annu Kapoor plays the role of Dr. Baldev Chadda, an infertility specialist, in search of the perfect sperm donor. I guess Indian cinema has already touched on the subject of surrogate mothers, but this type of infertility treatment hasn't been addressed yet (to my knowledge, maybe I'm wrong). Vicky Arora, (Ayushman Khurrana) a typical happy - go - lucky Punjabi, jobless and full of youth is the perfect candidate for Dr Chadda's requirement. Highly reluctant at first, Vicky acquiesces, enticed with the prospect of easy money. Yami Gautam looks sweet as the poised Bengali independent working Ashima Roy. How these two get married and what happens when confronted with the topic of having a child forms the rest of the story.The movie flows easily, with perfect editing and screenplay. Music has a couple of peppy Punjabi numbers and the song \"Paani da\" is a soothing melody. I was surprised to learn Ayushman had sung the male version. It's been a long time since a touching climax brought tears to my eyes, but there's no melancholic strains, and the movie ends on a happy note.",

A wonderful pictorial representation of the it.Anu Kapur acted fabulously as the crazy doctor, who sees the world as a sperm. He finds Ayushman as an extremely promising sperm for his business. Ayushman, despite of fearing about the society and their talks about his unusual job joins the Doctor. Though his first commercial movie, he played his role of a Desi, careless, fun loving and wanna be a big shot young man, with superb brilliance and surprising ease. His quirky replies keep a smile through out the movie. Everybody else too have played their part quite nicely. Must mentions are the catchy sequences of Vicky's ultra open grand mom and his mom, their tuning and their comments to prove other wrong. It is certainly the show stealer in the movie.

Anyway, this movie had its own charm and my personal convictions would not in any way, prevent me from appreciating the good aspects of the movie. The best I liked of the movie was the manner in which the delicate issues of infertility and sperm donation are handled. Given the fact that these are not topics one hears in public domain with an open mind, there was a great possibility that the director (Shoojit Sircar) and the core crew make a farce of it - and yet earn a profit. However, the movie does not in any way demean or make a mockery of these sensitive issues. And still make a great movie. Hats off to them for it. The focus is not the ethical debate nor the commercialisation of the act; it is the pain of longing for a child. Personally I liked the characters of Vicky and that of his grandmother. I liked the latter for her attitude to life and modern living, though chronologically she would be the eldest in the whole cast. One of my proposals for a better humanity, that of adoption of little orphaned children, forms the conclusion of the movie (that too, in fulfillment of a suggestion of the granny) - and I'm happy for it. The character of Vicky's father-in-law too has a significant contribution to make. Towards the end, he questions his daughter: Are you hurt because he was a donor or because he did not reveal this to you or because you cannot get pregnant while he can become a father? That's quite a sharp question demanding a very deep introspection.As by way of living out the character, Vicky does it the best. The evolution of the man from the youngster is portrayed well by Ayushmann Khurrana (Vicky). In the beginning he is nothing but a playful brat and by the end of the movie he is a doting father. This transformation is not something that happens with some single tragic event but is brought about because of his love for his wife. This transformation sets in smoothly and one cannot miss it. On the whole, a good movie, worth watching - could also be used to provoke a healthy discussion on ethical issues involved.",

Well crafted story, with funny dialogues, The best performance is by the infertility doctor Chadda, played by Annu Kapoor. Amazing performance, with some funny dialogues, Ayushmann and Yami have also given a great performance for their Bollywood debuts.The movie gets serious in the 2nd half and I thought it would end on a sad note, but it ended on a happy note, which was very nice. Other than the issue of sperm donation, the movie also shows the cultures of two different parts of the country and what happens when they intermingle.Music is very good, \"Pani Da Rang\" easily is the best song in the soundtrack, but other songs like \"Mar Jaiyan\", \"Whiskey Rum\", \"Ho Jaane De\" are also very good and melodious to listen to.Overall , I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone to watch it at least once.

I feel too many Bollywood films have violence in it, and I felt it was refreshing too see one without any violence at all. I feel more Bollywood films should be made in this style.To summarise the story, Vicky gets pushed by doctor chaddha to donate sperm, he refuses initially but eventually gives in. He continues as the money is great, and meets ashima a pretty bank employee who he ends up going out with and eventually marrying him. He hides his secret sperm donation past and the fact he did it even after marriage. She finds out after discovering she cant have children. She leaves him and they eventually reconcile.

Yes, Vicky Donor have theme of drama, comedy, openness, emotion, infertility and mainly sperm donation.In India, There are very little who have interest of sperm donation, but after watching Vicky Donor there would be so many who wants to donate their sperm. This movie also provide awareness so it is a multipurpose 'masala' comedy film.Vicky Arrora is a middle class Punjabi boy, who live with his mother and grandmother, he is a cool dude without any stress and he is also irresponsible, he works in beauty parlor of her mother, he neither went to bank one time in life. Dr. Baldev Chadda, infirmity specialist, convinced Vicky to donate sperm after several try. Meanwhile Vicky meets a Bengali girl Ashima Roy in a bank, he falls in love with her. Later, after several flirts of Vicky, Ashima also falls in love with Vicky. Ashima told him that she is divorc\u00e9e, but it was no problem to Vicky. Both of them convinced their family for marriage. After marriage Ashima came to know that she can not become mother. From now movie got tragedy and become emotional. At end, I think I also got a couple of drops of tears. :)The character of Dr. Chadda and Vicky is very much appreciated, both of them made a good chemistry and comedy. Dialogs are very good as they are in Punjabi and Hindi. Song \"Pani Ka rang\" is beautiful. Cinematography and editing are as usual normal. But movie had managed to bind you till end successfully. Overall movie is well balanced and became successful to show it's all motives. A good film with good motives always appreciated..!!!",

            "content": "Shoojit Sircar's Vicky Donor is a definite entertainer.The acting is nice, music is genuine, dialogs are witty and direction promising. Ayushmann Khurrana and Yami Gautam play their roles convincingly. They make such a good pair too in the film. It is difficult to believe that they are d\u00e9butantes.Dolly Ahluwalia as Vicky's mother and Annu kapoor as an eccentric Dr.Chaddha too steal the show. Kamlesh Gill,who plays the role of Vicky's grandmother requires a special mention.The film never never lags or crawls.The plot unwinds in its natural pace..with beautiful songs and plenty of memorable sequences.. Ayushmann's voice and music complement each other and fit perfectly into the mis en scene..especially the Punjabi song 'Pani Da Rang'.There is little masala and the film succeeds to an extent in popularizing the concept of sperm-donation .From a critical angle, the film makes certain brow-raising remarks about fertility and history. Dr. Chaddha's remarks about the high fertility/ potency rates of Aryans are questionable. History doesn't provide any evidence regarding the high potency rates of a particular race/tribe. Rather,it is more dependent on psychological reasons. Also the film seems to blindly support the Aryan invasion Theory, which is a highly debated topic even among historians.Anyways, Vicky Donor is not a historical/political film. It is a wholesome entertainer with a clear message. Even though it might have inspired by the Hollywood flick 'Starbuck', it doesn't depreciate the merit. Its just artistic license.Afterall, what is original but 'undetected Plagiarism??'8 stars..Kudos to the team!!",

Both have a different religion but all you need is understanding in inter cast marriage. Ayush is really a great actor he gave his best. I had not much expectation from this movie Vicky Donor, but when i seen it i was like O MY, I LOVED THIS MOVIE.It has a good message about sperm donation which we Indian's know very little about it and are narrow minded about the whole concept but this movie assures that this legal, i am sure after watching this movie many guys would take an initiative to this social act of donating sperm or may be start off as a way to make business.

It begins with the quest of a infertility specialist (Annu Kapoor)to search for a sperm donor of a superior quality. Enter Vicky (Ayushman)who is an unemployed, college pass out, typical flirting guy. He is a breathe of fresh air and the conversations between him and Annu Kapoor are hilarious to the hilt. His love interest (Yami Gautam) does an excellent job of an independent Bengali girl and her chemistry with Ayushman is really cute. The film also explores fertility issues, cultural differences and the taboo around sperm donation but the beauty of it lies in the humorous subtext through it all. The supporting cast made it all the more memorable experience and I wouldn't mind going for it again...",

            "content": "The paradox only seems to exist in Hindi Film Industry where a star actor or a star film maker who is expected to entertain the audience with a good content seldom achieves his/her primary objective, but there is no doubt that they mint money at the Box office. Personally, I consider a film an overall success only when it is critically as well as commercially successful. We've had many such small time films which have done extremely well at the BO as well as with the critics. Namely, Do Dooni Chaar, Bheja Fry, Band Baaja Baarat to name a few. I wasn't surprised when I heard that Vicky Donor was a winner amongst audiences across the country because the content looked promising in promos but the only catch was how the film maker will narrate the story of a sperm donor without crossing the boundaries of vulgarity.What surprised me was a sensitive topic (Yes! A Film on Sperm donation is sensitive in India) so beautifully weaved into a family film that not even for a minute will the film make you feel awkward if you are watching with your parents. Full credit certainly goes to the director and the writer. The film has many magical moments and the biggest one out of many is Annu Kapoors performance. The gentleman has entertained us with his small performances in the past. But, here he had a meaty role and has sketched his character with utmost precision. Secondly, the camaraderie between the in-laws was something which we haven't really seen on celluloid. Thirdly, the dialogues, which were as real as possible. Never seem to go astray. Very thoughtful backed by some real good performances from the entire cast. Ayushmann Khurana and Yami Gautam have got a good start to their respective movie careers and hopefully should remain as honest to their character in forthcoming films as they were in Vicky Donor. And lastly Kudos, to John Abrahim whose first film as a producer is a winner.Usually, a lot of time and money gets spent on Marketing a movie. Instead, if they come up with a strong script, the movie will attract a lot of attention as there is no bigger tool than Word of Mouth",

As a new actor 'Ayushmann Khurrana' played so smoothly his role as sperm donor was just fabulous. He is a very good singer indeed. I like that music which was sang by him. On the other hand, I am just love with 'Yami Gautam', she looks so sweet in this film. Her appearance made the tough sequence more fresh & alive. Lets talk about the main theme of the movie. As I mentioned above, the theme is quite unique and it was quite bit challenging to make such movie in this topic. I like the plot, script, expressions based on the scenario or sequence. I believe, this movie will make you smile, thinking about a situation when a family lives without child due to their own biological problem. Finally, I'll say- Must watch this one. You will enjoy it. :)",

First things first-Awesome storyline,the movie is light and funny both and at the same time manages to deliver the message of sperm Donation effortlessly !The story of Vicky Arora ,a normal punjabi guy who becomes a sperm donor is a delight to see! Ayushman Khurana is the perfect choice.He delivers the role with excellence and certainly deserves recognition! Yami Gautam is a pleasure to watch n matches up Ayushman's pace as a subtle bengali girl! Anu Kapoor is flawless as Dr.Chadda,The infertility doctor is hell bent on getting Vicky to become a sperm donor! Overall the film has been 1 of the best i have seen yet,given the fact i don't watch much Hindi movies,but i can assure you movies like Vicky Donor will make u realise that Hindi movies have much better to offer than the usual naach gana!Hats off to Shoojit Sarcar and John Abraham A MUST WATCH ! 10/10",

            "content": "He does a 'Houseful' and makes a 'Vicky Donor', John Abraham shows how deft he is when choosing scripts. And on that, especially for the one's he decides to make than to act in. Two comedies, both of them would make you laugh, smile and giggle but one would do that with a sound purpose and very tightly written and performed script- Vicky Donor.The film is not just a film. Though an out an out entertainer, it had a soul; a soul that touches the audience over and over. It had scenes that connect and surge up your eyes but with a smile on your face. The scene with Vicky's mother sleeping on his bed and murmuring is one such. Not missing on what houseful lauded of, the film is high on the quality of the 'Sense of Humour'. What adds to it all is the splendidly done characterization of Vicky's mother and grandmother.The spontaneity of the Punjabi munda and the elegant beauty of the Bong bala not just reminded me of Chetan Bhagat's '2 States' but made me smile to a lot more. The beauty of the Indian-ness of the relations was beautifully portrayed through the wedding and the 'coming together' of the two families. Indians are against everything, 'love marriages' for one, but just that they love their kids too much to agree to all and then 'All goes(is) well'.The script is so nicely paced and with surprisingly natural performances by the cast, Ayushmann and Annu in particular, the film never gives you a dull moment. With the melodies blended so very nicely with the storyline, you initially forget to appreciate the music and then you hear 'Paani da' in Aayushmaan's voice and hence discover your icing on the cake.Finally a film that educated the country which has seen a 50% rise in the number of 'infertile couple' in the last decade in the manner that it did, it definitely deserves a bow. Very well done Juhi Chaturvedi, John Abraham and Shoojit Sircar and off course not to forget Ayushmann Khurana or Vicky Donor.~Vaibhav Shrivastava Much more than a question of stars, still for me nothing less than 4.5 on a scale of 5.",

Sperm donation is not bad as seen by Indian society. You can actually give life to a parent who is dreaming about children but can't have that.2. Marrying a divorce is not a big deal. After all it might not be his/her fault.3. Inter Caste marriage\nand so on.It is One of the finest films of Ayushman Khurana with a fantastic story line.
