In no way are there any redeeming qualities in this \"film\" as it is filled with a moronic plot, hideous dialog(if you can call it that)banal acting and overall crap. The whole thing is a ruse; it looks like a low-budget made-for-TV film that ironically enough SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MADE-FOR-TV FILM IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! I'm sorry, but after Hanna Montana and the atrocious film that followed it, Miley Cyrus's career as an actress is pretty much in the toilet. Only a wickedly hardcore Miley Cyrus fan would watch this because any self-respecting movie-lover would stay clear away from this hell-hole of a movie.1 out of 5 stars. That's how bad this piece of sh*t is.",

I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews, yeah obviously it's not the best film ever made but these people giving it terrible reviews are obviously the wrong demographics. it is obviously aimed at tweens and young teenaged girls. It's very cliche and very cheesy, but i think if you seen it were you were young and re watch it it's very nostalgic. It actually gave me goosebumps haha but yes it's a rom com and the acting isn't amazing but it's not awful and I have a soft spot because I loved it so much as a child but I can understand if you hadn't seen it when you were younger I could understand why some scenes are a bit cringe but I think it's great and doesn't deserve the extreme hate.",

If that doesn't deter you from watching, then maybe knowing that Miley Cyrus is starring as the lead role does.I never had high hopes for this movie especially since Lionsgate completely shunned the marketing team and had no effort in making sure that this movie gets some much needed publicity. But aside from that, this movie isn't really targeted for people like me. It seems to focus on its teen demographic, hell the title says it all...LOL.Now I'm not hating on Miley Cyrus or anything but God that girl really brought down the movie. I thought that she could maybe prove that she can act and switch away from that Hannah Montana crap, but no, she cannot. And having Demi Moore didn't help either. It's like the cast had every intention to make a god-awful movie that only teenage girls would barely like.Overall, the movie was your average run of the mill, teenage love affair crap. If you're a guy then stay the hell away from this movie, but if you're a girl then...no, you should also stay away from this movie.",

            "content": "I'm going to summarize here:This \"film\" bears about as much connection with modern society as KFC represents the life of Chickens. Not only is it the most cheese filled pap ever, it's a walking clich\u00e9 and the people in it, even say the word \"LOL\" rather than actually laughing, in one scene; one person even rolls around the floor laughing when she is told a joke by her friend, and it wasn't even funny. The entire dialogue in this film looks as if it has actually been written on a Nokia 3310 by a 10 year old boy, who has ADHD, no offence to people who actually HAVE ADHD, but seriously, it's like they've given a child three things:1. MDMA.2. 90 Blank Sheets of Paper and a typewriter.3. 2 Days to complete it.The acting is below par and even in one scene, it is blatantly obvious that the actress has forgotten her lines, so she seems to make her line up on the spot. How on earth did Demi Moore get roped into this? Demi Moore has made some god awful movies in her time, but this will be a black hole on her CV for many years to come and I imagine she is only kicking herself to the loony bin for partaking in this absolute rubbish.Then I have to mention the obvious fake posts on here which are condoning and praising this teeny bopper movie, which is obviously made to capitalise on fans of the girl out of this, kids who are grounded and have to use their phones as a social outlet, LOL, and teen kids who have nothing better to do with their money than go and see how the media thinks they should live their lives.Anyone paying to watch this god awful trash should take themselves and get counselling, go and see a doctor, because whilst there are thousands and thousands of good script writers trying to earn a living, thousands of actors trying to break through; and thousands of budding directors just aching for a chance to even get 1% of this budget for their work; production companies are still lying and pulling the wool over our eyes with pap like this.If you are fan of the girl in this film, think about it, and think about it hard!!!If you actually like this girl, then you will NOT go and put money into the pockets of the greed ridden pigs who are actually trying to exploit YOU as well as your idol. So I'm not going to give you grief for liking this girl; like most will, but seriously think about it before you part with your money. If this film does even remotely well, the fat corporate pigs will only release more pap with her in, to try and prize YOUR hard earned money from your hands, and in turn, the big wheel of fortune will grind away on YOU and ONLY YOU!It says something when a production company pull out of post production marketing like they did on this kids, they want to BURY it without trace, because they know how terrible this film truly is! Fair enough, watch it on cable (it will be on there soon enough), download it from some kind of torrent site, but whatever you do, do NOT go and spend a penny of your money on this, you will regret it for years to come.Long live the free thinkers.",

            "review_title": "I've got a Juno poster in my room. There! I'm smart now.",
            "content": "In the movie, LOL, the character, Lola, has a poster for the smash-hit, Juno, hanging in her bedroom. I know, I know. Analyzing a detail as small as this might sound nitpicky but just hear me out.Juno was a movie about a teenager who addressed the people she loved and the people she had problems with, in person. Juno revealed an ultrasound picture of her baby to its future adoptive parents, in person. She laid out an entire living room set on Paulie Bleeker's front lawn, to tell him she was pregnant, in person. The reason its main character maintained quick-witted comebacks and came up with ironic allegories, at the drop of a hat, was because of her characteristic of going out and exploring new things. That movie was so refreshing because it took place in a world in which teenagers didn't constantly have the glow of a cell phone screen, reflecting off of their faces. In fact, there was only one part in the film involving a phone conversation between two people...and both sides had their phones plugged into a jack!So why does LOL's mentioning of such a great movie bother me? Because its own message contradicts Diablo Cody's vision and her faith in teenagers. Cody believed in a world in which adolescents might actually look up from their gadgets, turn to each other and like, talk. Hell, there actually is a scene from Wall-E, in which two morbidly obese men favor looking at monitors with video feed each other, when they're in floating chairs, side by side. Juno spits in the face of such technological dependence.LOL, on the other hand, condones the non-stop usage of iPods, Twitter and other sites of the moment. Its lead characters are so reliant of online social networks, where every sentence is simplified and shortened, that once they finally log off, they use phrases like \"it's good to love someone so much it hurts.\" A line like that wouldn't even make it into Juno's deleted scenes section on the DVD. LOL celebrates the idea of kids, hunching their heads over a five by three inch screen all day long, as the rest of the world passes them by. Don't get me wrong - I'm well aware that there actually are teenagers in the world who are this overly consumed. With it being near impossible to find a person between the ages of 18 and 29 NOT on a phone within a three hour period of time, writer and director, Lisa Azuelos, isn't exactly making up fiction here. But to try to portray these hypnotized kids as deep thinking and complex is wrong. How could they have the drive to reflect on who they are when they don't even put effort into typing out full words into text messages? Like I said, it's fine for characters like these to exist because there are real world people like this. But don't try dragging another film down to your level when it boasts unexplained emotions, open for interpretation while your own best moment of self-reflection consists of the line \"Every year, it's weird going back to school but here we are, just going with the flow\". Oo-hoo-hoo, look out, Hemingway.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: LOL",
            "content": "The first Hollywood film to premiere in India this year, which is quite apt since I suppose audiences in India can appreciate remakes upon remakes hitting their screens every now and then, since different movie regions in India have cross-made their films especially if they are financially successful. This version of LOL is a second generation remake, with the original film made with French actress Sophie Marceau playing the role of Miley Cyrus' titular role of Lola, before switching to play Demi Moore's role of mom in writer-director Lisa Azuelos' 2006 version, who then decided to direct the same film all over again, this time with Hollywood money. I suppose it's tough getting bored when doing the same project, albeit with a different cast bringing different sensibilities to the table, and of course, being set in different countries allowed for an exploration of the modern / current day teenage trials and tribulations, and see how they would have differed from the very first film. For starters, this is an out and out teenage chick flick, set in high school where topics are rather constricted, ranging from bad grades to boys, to hot teachers and cliques, circle of trust and betrayals, and so on. High schools make for very fertile ground as a story setting, but you really can't get away from the formula, even if technology from webcams to IM chat sessions enter to spice things up a littleMiley Cyrus had a scene involving smoking of drugs here cut out, because a real life shenanigan blew way out of control with the teenage idol hell bent and desperate to leave behind her Disney child-friendly persona of Hanna Montana. Be it having provocative personal pictures making their way online, to recreational drug use or otherwise, the filmmakers probably thought it best to leave behind the negative publicity, and cut that out of the film. Which didn't do the flow any favours at times, with other less than stellar editing efforts such as a following scene that contradicted what was said before.In any case Cyrus plays Lola, a teenager who opens the film being dumped by her boyfriend Chad (George Finn), and we'd just about know that she'll fall head over heels with her best male buddy Kyle (Douglas Booth) especially after gushing ad nausem about him and confessing so in her secret diary. But the road to true romance is always a bumpy ride, so you can bet your last dollar it has to deal with misunderstandings which led to temporal breakups and the like, not to mention falling school grades all over the shop make school life quite the bane to a relationship. Kyle too has issues with his dad's frowning upon his musical CCA, but since this is a chick flick, who really cares about the male characters anyhow, except when they fail to pout and look hot.Subplots in the film that pad it up include a focus on Lola's best friend Emily (Ashley Hinshaw), who has the hots for her math teacher (Austin Nichols) with dream boat looks, and is the female equivalent of a Stifler or that obligatory rude, shock jock in any teenage sex comedy, and of course, Mom Anne, which the film splits 50-50 with her own relationship, being unable to move on from the husband (Thomas Jane) she divorced, and being at the crossroads to begin one with a rather persistent cop James (Jay Hernandez). Plus the dynamics between mother-daughter getting the highlights and focus as well, between Anne and Lola where sometimes they drive each other nuts, only to always inherently realize blood runs thicker than water.LOL, after so many iterations, came off as flat and offered little surprises to fans of such films, who lap it up only because of a different cast. It's the usual chick flick dealing with rudimentary issues for its formula, which in real life may not even be issues at all. It's mildly amusing with nary a class act from anyone in their delivery, and perhaps it's that generation gap that's fast driving a wedge between myself and issues brought up in the film which may seem like a big deal for one growing up. Surely it's a coming of age tale, but I'm not getting it, nor am I the right demographic targeted to begin with.",

Miley Cyrus is by far the WORST actress of all time, narrowly beating the entire cast of The Room for that title. Demi Moore is completely idiotic in this film, trying her best to portray a mother but only falters as the task despite being a mother herself to children in the same age bracket. The supporting cast, made up of Thomas Jane, Jay Hernandez, Fisher Stevens and Gina Gershon try to elevate this direct to DVD film with an unsuccessful result. The film's story is horrendous, it tries to convey high school filled with overbearing clich\u00e9s that have been done better and more tastefully in other previous films.

            "content": "This film appears to be a very, very loud statement by Miley Cyrus that she is no longer the sweet and innocent Hannah Montana but is 'edgy'--and the results come off as rather vulgar just for the sake of vulgarity. The characters in the film use lots of profanity, lie repeatedly, are obsessed with sex, make passes at their high school teachers (now THAT'S a positive story element!), smoke, drink heavily, do drugs and act sullen and selfish. But at least they remember to use condoms! Yep...this certainly ain't \"Hannah Montana\"! Now I CAN understand Cyrus wanting to broaden her appeal and grow up, but this is NOT the right way to do it--especially since I am sure many of her TV fans ended up going to this film. As a parent of a teen, I just thought this was nasty...very, very nasty. While I know many teens ARE like this, why did everyone (parents included) have to be so darn unlikable?! Yes, the 'adults' seemed no better! This gets to the heart of the film's problem--the unlikability of everyone. Although the production values are good, what good did this film do for Cyrus' flagging career and who was the intended audience? Apart from extremely disaffected 18-20 year-olds (who probably wouldn't be caught dead going to a Miley Cyrus film as that's NOT cool), I have no idea. Parents would be offended and shocked and nice kids would probably not appreciate its strong PG-13 (close to R) sensibilities--or be allowed to see the film. I just wish everyone would just grow up in this film. And, by the way, when the film had an anti-drug message, it's very strong pro-drug message through the earlier part of the film made this all seem very hypocritical.While I hated the film and thought it gross, some of the Indie music was nice (though, as an old man of 48, if I liked it then it clearly is NOT cool and kids will hate it) and the production values (apart from the script) were nice. Clearly, the film cost a bit of money and is not an Ed Wood epic...but it certainly ain't great. Apparently, for a while this film was in IMDb's Bottom 100 list. However, a recent spike now has lifted it to an overall score of 2.8--still hardly a great film if ratings can be trusted...and in this case, they probably can be.",

            "content": "LOL (2012) * (out of 4)Lisa Azuelos remakes her own French movie. This one here has Miley Cyrus playing a teen who seems obsessed with sex, drugs and music, which is something her single mom (Demi Moore) doesn't know about. I'm guessing that's the so-called plot to this film but the truth is that plot and this movie really don't go together. I can't comment on the original film since I haven't seen it yet but this thing here pretty bad but thankfully it's so bad that most people should be able to get a couple good laughs out of it. I think what really kills the movie is the fact that every character from the teens to their parents are just downright idiots. I mean, the Moore character is without question one of the dumbest mothers I've ever seen from any movie. Just watch the way the character pretty much can't put her foot down on anything and the scene where Cyrus talks her out of taking her phone away is just embarrassing. Even worse is a sequence later on when mommy and daughter have it out after mom reads her diary and notices all the things she's been up to. Not only the entire sequence unintentionally funny, the performances by the two actresses is just embarrassing. Cyrus really comes off bad here because she can't handle what limited range the character has. The scenes with her crying are just poorly done and I can't say I believed anything she did here. Moore isn't quite as bad but she's burdened by the horrid character. Even Gina Gershon, Ashley Greene and Thomas Jane can't do anything. Everything from the dialogue to the actual story is just really bad and there's really nothing good to mention here outside the use of a certain Rolling Stones song. What keeps LOL watchable is how bad it manages to be and I'm going to guess that the only people this thing will appeal to are those who enjoy movies that are so bad they're watchable.",

It's a movie about teenagers, so its set in a teenage world, with teenage rules. It's about the sort the sort of the stuff that only seems to be important when you are still at a young age and far from adulthood. Well, I say teenagers but of course all of them are being played by some 20-year old's, which is something pretty obvious and annoying about this movie as well.And really, this entire movie seems to about a bunch of non-issues. I just don't see what the big 'conflict' is supposed to be in this movie and there is just never any sense of true drama in the movie. This is mostly what makes this movie such a pointless watch. Crazy thing about the movie is that you can watch just and only the first 5 and last 5 minutes of this movie and you won't feel like you missed anything because of the simple reason that you also haven't done so. The characters and situations are still being mostly the same at the end of the movie. Perhaps they could had still made this movie somewhat interesting by making it a coming-of-age movie but all this movie seemed to be concerned about was appealing to young teens, who perhaps will be able to identify with some of the characters and situations in this movie but I just can't even imaging them being all that entertained by this movie. There is just far too little happening for that.It's also a movie that confuses and does some stupid things. I swear at first I thought that some of the characters were 'bad guys' but as the movie progressed it suddenly became apparent to me that they were part of the friend-group of the movie and you were even supposed to like these characters. And that's also a problem of the movie. Most of the character aren't really being sympathetic enough to ever care for or be interested enough in.Also an odd thing to see some big name actors in a movie like this. Demi Moore, Thomas Jane, Gina Gershon, Jay Hernandez, all play some quite big parts. Perhaps they were just eager to appear in a Miley Cyrus movie, who is still being a hot young star but isn't exactly known for doing great movies.Pointless movie, that is pointless to watch.4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Also just for your information teenagers - \"LOL\" is an abbreviation we were using in the 90s when we invented the internet as it is now, go make up your own stuff!",

She communicates via characters and has a super cute BF (George Finn).But when he cheats on her, she hooks up with his friend (Douglas Booth), who is lusted after by Lola's nemesis (Ashley Greene).Meanwhile, Lola's single-mother (Demi Moore) finds her diary and decides to cancel her class trip to Paris. All the while juggling her ex (Thomas Jane) and her younger crush (Jay Hernandez).Though it attempts to be a comedic commentary on today's parent/child relationships, this American version of a French film is merely a vapid snapshot of this electronic epoch.On the bright side, Miley Cyrus texting is less annoying than Miley Cyrus talking.

There is a lot of moaning about 'these kids with cell phones constantly in their face'. The problem is that this film fails to challenge that image at all. I understand that the way teenagers communicate has changed. They use internet slang in person, they are on social media a lot and always using a smart-phone. It makes sense for films to reflect that.The problem is that this film is total tripe, regardless.The acting is horrendous on all sides, particularly Cyrus who clearly already passed the limits of her acting talent in Hannah Montana and needs to just jack it in. How Demi Moore got involved in this I do not know. Sure, she's done some bad movies in the past but I thought she was older and wiser now. Apparently not.I not only failed to empathise with any of these people, I actively started to dislike all of them for being so woefully one dimensional. If you have a teenage daughter, or even just know a teenage girl, ask her about her life at school or the boys she likes. I guarantee it will be more interesting and engaging than the plot of this film.I actually consider this film does more harm than good to the very people it portrays. It could have been an insight into the, sometimes impenetrable, world of teenage life. It could have shown parents or other adults how things have changed since their youth and why social media is so important to teenagers these days. Instead it just reinforces the image that they are shallow, whiny, and entitled 'kids' with no perspective on the real world.I would say this is just for hardcore Miley Cyrus fans but actually it's more likely to upset you if you liked her before.

I do however feel that I've not only been robbed for my time, but also for all of the knowledge I've ever gathered over the years.

Here comes the but though.--About Miley Cyrus: She seems to struggle to find her way after the Hannah Montana series and albums, and maybe to show her dad (Billy Ray Cyrus) that she is fine on her own. Not a waste of talent, because she hasn't got any in this sort of medium.Well, according to the re-created LOL she is not that fine. I completely understand that she doesn't want to be a Disney minion for ever, but this fake rebel chick and the whole world is against she is just not cool. Seriously why is she doing this? She got too much before she could understand the responsibility which comes with being celebrity.--About everyone else: I don't know how could Cyrus force Demi Moore to take the role in this film but hey, she managed to, and it works for some reason. Demi Moore just does what she is great at. Scores 4 out of 5 for me.--Young female actresses: Average performance and nothing else. Except for Lina Esco, who portrayed the American version of St\u00e9phanie (Lou Lesage). Even though in the 2012 version the girls did not have such a big role as in the original, she made a good impersonation. (3 out of 5) Male actors: The class mates were just like the original ones, maybe a bit less hip, to \"make them able to be sold\".--About the film itself (containing info about locations): The story has been rewritten to fit into the line of the below average American re-created films. Instead of Paris they gave Chicago, instead of England they gave Paris.--Verdict: Below average acting, absolutely unnecessary remake, the only market share it can hold to is the American. For some reason they love to ruin the European films. The only exception in the near past was so far the the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. IMDb score for the original: 7.8, US version 7.9. As for the LOL, figures are not so great. The original has a score of 6.1, the US version 3.5 and it won't be any better.--For me: 2 out of 10, and I was really kind because I liked Demi Moore and Lina Esco.",

This becomes increasingly worsened via the slaughter of what was once an excellent script. Humour (if it can even be referred to as such) pushed to its very limits; and scenes that had viewers covering their faces as though ashamed to be seen as they fled the cinema before even 20 minutes in.What amuses me the most however, is that this actually seems to be getting positive feedback from a very small, direct audience.

As a viewer, I was expecting a little more of deepness in the characters. The social relations between Miley Cyrus character and the teens involved seems too predictable, flat and empty. The student that has a crush on a teacher is a clich\u00e9 theme, that don't bring nothing new. Besides, the relationship mother-daughter appears too artificial.

The obvious morality stints of teen sex and drugs is brought in a way where only the superfluous banality of it remains. That criticism is coming from a moderate consumer of said herbs and an inveterate cheater movie addict who mostly watches John Waters and Kevin Smith films... It's a sad day for teen movies. Where are the complex intertwining motives \"\u00e0 la\" John Hugues, or the ironic yet quite serious movie making of Amy Heckerling? The parents are a) too lenient or b) harsh Nazi like figures of pseudo authority. By pushing his kid, one of the fathers actually commits a felony. 2/10...

Nothing was resolved or overcome. It seems like they just took a chapter out of this girls diary and said \"lets make this a movie\". The only thing close to a climax is when the mother reads the girls diary and that is quickly overcome. I think the goal of the movie was to draw parallels between the mother and daughter, which they do with a bunch of unnecessary plot lines. It jumps around from one thing to the next. Plus they put too much attention on the irrelevant details that it confuses you to the actual plot line (Which is nonexistent). They show you a little of her boyfriends homelike (where nothing is changed or achieved) and the mothers love life (where she just jumps around). I feel like a plot should go somewhere, especially side plots. Movies should feel like you're taking a journey from start to finish and this feels like it started in the middle and ended shortly after.",

There was no moral ground for teenagers whatsoever. It almost seemed to encourage drugs, sex and disobeying your parents.

The film seemed to want to play on the social media and texting culture of kids but didn't seem to grasp the concept.

For some reason, at times the framing switches from normal teen comedy to European indie deep depressing film, with long and extreme closeups of ugly people's faces. Also the aspect ratio is extremely narrow and throughout the film there's some sms chatting printed on the extreme left of the screen, which gets cropped out if you enlarge the image to make it not look like a sausage of image inside your TV.Don't believe other reviews that say that the bad ratings are because it's a chick flick and people \"don't get it\": the one stars are the movie's fault, not the genre's. I love cheese chick flicks and I rate movies according to each genre's standards, I won't give a rom-com a low rating for being silly or predictable, so believe me that there's no anti teen flick bias in this review.Watch at your own risk.",

There is no way in hell that these kids would be hanging out with that many hot girls. The group of friends that is portrayed in this awful film would never be considered the cool kids at this school. Not once in this movie are these kids actually bullied. Why do these movies portray the cool kids in high school to be a bunch of whiny artsy kids who complain all the time and constantly look like they are about to cry? Not one person I have ever met has ever acted like these kids in high school. Not only did I hate every character in this movie, but I hated every word that came out of every stupid mouth. The dialogue seemed to have been written by a thirteen year-old girl who is trying to sound sexually mature. I felt like this (presumed) thirteen-year-old girl writer just wrote one draft to this script and that was that, the first draft was the final draft. I was so confused as why people got together or why they broke up or why they got back together. Things would happen with zero explanation to it. Why did Lola and Kyle make-up with no words spoken while on the plane to Paris. They broke up for no reason then got back together for no reason. Then out of nowhere Lola appears to become a lesbian with that blonde haired girl but they never address that relationship. Also, at the beginning of the movie Lola says that Kyle was her best friend all her life but at the end of the stupid movie she introduces him to her mom. HOW HAVE THEY NEVER MET IF HE HAS BEEN LOLA'S BEST FRIEND ALL HER LIFE. This movie is the worst movie ever made.",

There were also many girls who looked the same, and were also very confusing. The movie was altogether quite boring, and I would not recommend it to anyone.

Not because of any tummy-tickling humor or laugh-til-you-drop moments, but of the fact that this is even remotely considered a movie at all! LOL follows Lola (played by Miley Cyrus), a stereotypical teenager going through her stereotypical problems in her stereotypical life. Aside from a few sentimental mother/daughter moments and a well-fitted soundtrack this movie holds nothing special. It lacks meaning with it's stale dialogue recycled from the more vapid teenagers facebook page. If anything can be learned from this movie it's that internet slang should remain on the internet! Miley's performance is, as usual, bland, with nothing more to offer than the reciting of the script and a splash of her usual rebellious demeanour. She falls in love with her best friend Kyle, who just so happens to play in a band called 'No Shampoo', with her ex-boyfriend. Aside from this predictable coincidence you'll be pleased to know that they take the whole 'No Shampoo' thing to the next level by applying this philosophy to Miley's hairstyle throughout the movie. No doubt they saved a considerable amount of their budget! All in all the movie lacks a genuine plot as we observe lingering conflicts which end up simply dealt with and lack the epiphany needed to make them the focus of the film. The movie as a whole seems to avoid the traditional 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', which we normally associate with successful films, so that it's unclear to see what the films motive is. To say this movie was a 'disappointment' would be a huge understatement and a great compliment to it! So for all you movie-lovers out there who're looking for a good movie to watch, this is definitely not your cup of tea! Rating: 4/10 ... and that's me being generous",

If this is what our society thinks is a good way for teenagers in this generation to act, it needs fixing now. The main character (played by Miley Cyrus) threw a tantrum because her mother read her diary and found out that she was sleeping with someone, she packed her bags and went to live with her dad. This is definitely not how teenagers should be acting. Teenagers need to learn to take responsibility for their actions, not jump to conclusions before they've heard the whole story. And they definitely shouldn't expect to get whatever they want, whenever they want just because they want it. Which is exactly what this movie is portraying. Basically showing young girls that they can disrespect themselves and their family, be rude and impolite to those who love them just because they didn't get what they wanted. Spoilt little brats. I would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone, it's sending the wrong message. Especially to teenage girls. Horribly horrendous.",

I kept wanting to cut Demi Moore's hair cause it was always a so long and messy. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack, and I mean it, music was excellent, rest of movie sucked.

I hope it doesn't harm any future opportunities.The plot is a mess. It has some interesting concepts but none of them were developed well enough for them to be relevant to the story. The storyline was all over the place and the first half seemed like a never ending commercial for Apple. If the writers had taken the time to develop the characters instead of relying on their good looks to win us over then this venture would have been more of a success. I didn't care about any of the characters and despised Cyrus' character Lol. (I am not a Miley hater by the way, I tried so hard to like her character in this film. I'm not commenting on her acting ability either, she really wasn't given much to play with here) She was empty, shallow, vapid and spoilt and I couldn't empathize with her in the slightest, she had no depth to her and no personality. The themes were vague. I wish they had spent more time creating decent dialogue instead of relying on wishy washy montages. It just wasn't coherent and to watch was completely frustrating. To say this film is about a mother that discovers her teenager's diary is misleading also as this literally happens in the last 15 minutes and is quickly resolved. There was no real relationship between the two anyway so this seemed like a pointless way of injecting some actual action in to the story as it feels like nothing really happens.They could have easily just focused on one theme- either the friendship and development of a relationship with one of her best friends (they didn't even seem like best friends to begin with? we just had to rely on \"He's been my friend for a really long time\" quote) or the relationship between a mother and daughter (they didn't seem to have one either?) or this \"reliance on technology\" thing that wasn't even that prominent. It was just irritating and annoying to see them text each other all of the time. It was like an excessively long phone commercial. It just seemed like this aspect was added so the film makers could claim this is what their film was about. The more I write the more frustrated I become. I don't know. I'd just avoid it.

Now, objectively, there have been other \"worse\" teen sex movies, like the innumerable American Pie sequels, but this one is offensive because of the fact that it so obviously has pretensions to be a generation defining examination of the sexual politics of high schoolers. But contrasting this film to even the Tina Fey penned \"Mean Girls\", almost a decade this film's junior, LOL absolutely pales in comparison. Now, I'm willing to give Lisa Azuelos some credit. I have not seen her original 2008 French film, and maybe it's good. Maybe it is the sharp edged satire that this film failed to be. Maybe something was lost in the translation to English. Maybe, lines such as \"Skank-ass ho\" don't engender the kind of bad laughs in French as they do in English. But, ultimately, the faults in this movie have to come down to her screenplay. Character motivations change every minute, plot lines are introduced, dropped, only to be either picked up again at a point when it's convenient for the film or just abandoned outright. The casting was atrocious. Miley Cyrus cannot act. Not that any other actress would have much luck trying to breathe life into this rotting , personality-void corpse of a character, whose only motivation in life seems to be deciding between two nearly identical wispy haired low-rent Cilian Murphy lookalike she's gonna give her V-card to. But give the artist formerly known as Hannah Montana some credit, at least she looks like a teenager! The absolutely goose-bump inducing storyline involving the blonde wanting to bump hormonal uglies with her math teacher fails to capture the creepiness and desperation of the situation if only for the fact that the two actors look about six months apart in age! Not that any of that matters, as this plot thread, like so many others, comes to a complete halt with no resolution, no consequence, and no lessons learned. And that's the biggest problem with this movie, it gives us absolutely no reason to care at all about the people in it. Why should I care about Lola's love life? What about this cop am I supposed to find charming apart from his motorcycle and leather jacket? Why should I like Kyle as opposed to the other guy?(I can't remember his name, and no, I won't look it up because I've already spent an hour and a half of my life on this movie, and that's about two hours too long.) Demi Moore is the only one in this movie that comes across as credible. She's believable as a single mom trying to have a family and a career(What career, you ask? Good question, we're never told.). This movie is a complete mess of half-baked ideas trying to say something profound about the Twitter generation. Take my advice: watch Mean Girls or Fast Times at Ridgemont High, two films that despite their age have as much to say about teenagers in their time as they do now. And I guarantee you won't have to hear the line \"skank-ass ho\" in either of them.",

I couldn't get netflix to fast forward so I just sat through until the end. These stars need to stop believing their own press releases.

The story flows quickly and when I first saw the opening scene I wasn't expecting much, but it was totally worth it. I saw a lot of bad comments and reviews after I saw the movie, but the fact is, it is painting a picture of a reality we're living in. You can say all you want about how this movie was about Facebooking, texting, using the internet and technology, but the fact is you wouldn't even have written all of these reviews if it wasn't for the technology. It is what it is, and we can discuss about it forever, but the fact is - this is our reality. But, I think the point of this movie was that no matter how much technology takes over our lives, we need to remember that we are human and that we need to appreciate and respect each other. The reality we're living in isn't perfect, and that technology taking over isn't not that good thing, but we can't stop it from happening and we just have to use it in a good way - supporting each other with it, being there for each other and respect the values of life. I don't want to push it much further than this and write something I'll regret, but all I want to say is - don't be harsh on this one, and give it a chance.

I usually don't like Miley Cyrus as an actress and usually won't waste my time watching films or shows she's been in, but I do enjoy movies with Douglas Booth and Ashley Greene. So, I began watching the movie and it seemed like it showed promise as being an original (or slightly original) movie (even though it's an American adaption of a French film). Then it got really clich\u00e9 really fast. I was able to predict exactly what was going to happen before it happened and it was just so ridiculous. I literally fast forwarded at times and wasn't lost in the slightest. It had soooo much promise. Had they tweaked it slightly it would've been such a better film. Maybe if they had dipped into Kyle's home life a little more or spent less time on Lola's friend. It felt like none of the stories they were bringing in really made sense or mattered. It was just splotches of a teenagers daily life without the depth of meaning to it. It portrayed a true relationship between friends, enemies, love interests, and parents; even if Lola and Kyle's friendliness was a little stressed and the interest in each other too obvious in the beginning. Honestly I was more interested in Kyle's home life then I was in Lola's. And the movie was in Lola's POV. (for most of the movie) Maybe if they'd added some confrontation with Kyle and Chad about his and Lola's relationship or gave SOMETHING that wasn't so dry. You really only get the face value and some slight shallow depth to each of the teenagers when the movie could have been so much more. The people who worked on the film state the movie didn't do well at the box office because of the lack of publicity it got, but that wasn't it at all. It was because they had an amazing cast with a lacking story line that didn't make the audience care.

            "content": "Let me clarify one thing first. I'm giving thumbs down to this movie not because of the people involved and the already known lack of consideration most people have with teen stars like Cyrus, but because this movie is weak. Here's a comedy/romance/drama flick that doesn't add anything new to anything.What can I say? It's a little torturing to see the adventures and misfortunes of poor rich girl Lola (Miley Cyrus), known as LOL among their friends. \"LOL\" draws a colorful and clich\u00e9d portrait of being a teenager in the 21st century and how relationships are constructed with cellphones, computers, text messages, etc and etc, how they deal with their parents, their colleagues, friends and teachers, boyfriends and girlfriends. How new is that? Most of the time you just sit there and watch in a complete state of embarrassment all the up's and down's of the main character while trying to make things done, a very unnecessary emotional roller-coaster that predictably ends with everything going well and everybody being friends of everybody after spending most of the movie battling each other.For those who think five stars is too much, I say it's not. There's some enjoyable things in here. When the movie isn't focusing on Lola, we have time to spend along with her mom (played by Demi Moore, still stunning after all these years) having good dates with a younger cop (Jay Hernandez), her first encounters after divorcing from her husband (Thomas Jane). The movie tries to establish a parallel between mom and daughter in showing how similar they are but that doesn't work much because one is interesting to follow while the other is not. The parties Lola's mom has with her friends are so much fun, the adults dialogs are far more engaging than the ones Lola and her friends have. The presence of the veteran actors (Moore, Fisher Stevens, Nora Dunn and others) makes this a little nice to watch. Better than they are Cyrus's partners Douglas Booth (playing her friend who later becomes the boyfriend) and sadly underused in this movie Jean-Luc Bilodeau (playing her \"backup\" boyfriend, used to cause jealous on the first when they broke up). If you're not gonna enjoy the story, the clich\u00e9s and the ridiculous parts at least there's some hot guys to stare at it.To me, \"LOL\" was exactly like watch the long and endless TV series \"Malha\u00e7\u00e3o\", very popular in here since 1994 and still goes on, changing cast but presenting the exact same story with the main focus on teens. I admit, the series were quite good up until the beginning of the 2000's, then it became all downhill, infuriatingly repetitive and no longer dealing with serious issues that concerns many young people out there. It's all about rich kids and their fake romances, having party after party, carrying a certain sense of positivism that isn't so present in youth. It's annoying. More annoying than everything here was being forced to hear a French version of \"Alright\", whatever that band is, they ruined Supergrass classic. Too bad that the negative aspects overcome the very few positive ones, it's just cheap and quite non involving. It's not a good suggestion to go watch it only for the brief decent moments but if interested, go ahead. You've been warned. There's worst out there but it's certain that there are great things out there waiting to be discovered. 5/10",

Things that was supposed to be meaningful, were just left there without any explanation. Characters were too stereotypical and the \"important\" thing that was supposed to happen between the mum and daughter happened in the last fifteen minutes. Felt like they had too much totally meaningless scenes and then they realized that they should actually make some ending to this movie, so they just rushed it and left so many things unexplained. For a teenager movie, this was a failure. Real teenager, however angsty and rebel they are, they are not that stupid. Seriously, don't watch this movie, it's total waste of time.",

Nothing happened in this film. Complete lack of conflict and resolution. There wasn't even very much coming of age. This movie might have been interesting if they had worked in a rap battle, kidnapping, depraved love triangle, or even just one antagonist. ANYTHING! It felt like watching really elaborate CCTV.

With Keane, Coconut Records, and Jean-Philippe Verdin, it's perfect. I like how the music from the original movie has been used. Pretty much everything is identical to the original French film except the names of all the characters other than Lola and Anne. And the cast, of course. I'm not a huge fan of Miley Cyrus but she was amazing in this film and so was Demi Moore. George Finn and Douglas Booth were great too.The portrayal of the mother-daughter relationship was realistic and accurate. High school? Probably not. I wish my school could have been that fun.

            "content": "Lola (Miley Cyrus) is a teenage student at a high school in Chicago who lives with her mother, \"Anne\" (Demi Moore). She has a few friends at the school and when she isn't hanging out with them she stays in contact through her cell phone or laptop computer. At the beginning of the new school year she is devastated when her boyfriend, \"Chad\" (George Finn) tells her that he was sleeping with someone else during the summer vacation and that he now wants to breakup. Rather than admit that she was alone during this time she tells him that she had also been sleeping with someone. He then begins to treat her like a slut which makes their breakup even worse. Fortunately, her friends \"Emily\" (Ashley Henshaw) and \"Kyle\" (Douglas Booth) are there for her and help her get over the breakup. However, during this time she begins to fall in love with Kyle which results in another problem down the line caused inadvertently by Emily. At any rate, as far as this movie is concerned, although it is billed as a comedy-drama-romance it actually doesn't have that much comedy. At least there wasn't much humor that I could see. Additionally, the plot was rather thin and some of the scenes seemed to drag here and there. But Miley Cyrus performed rather well and Ashley Henshaw certainly added to the scenery. Even so, neither one of these qualities were enough to elevate this film into the average range. That said, although it may appeal to a younger audience I rate this film as slightly below average.",

LOL is a story of a teenage girl growing up and falling in love, getting cheated on and dealing with separation of their parents. Miley Cyrus looks chic but I think at times she went overboard plus she is not that great of an actress and since we want strong female actress to lead teen movies she falls short. Douglas Booth is another charming British lad can't wait to see him in Romeo & Juliet. Jessica Hinshaw & Ashley Green are gorgeous. Demi Moore and Jay Hernandez sizzle on screen. Austin Nicoles, Thomas Jane, Jean-Luc Bilodeau and George Finn are fine in it. On the whole, LOL is an enjoyable teen movie with great soundtracks and good production value.",

So I decided to watch the whole thing it never had a plot. That is probably what bothered me the most. However I am not going to slam down as a god awful movie either because I have seen worse. Let me tell you what is good about it or what I really think the writers and makers of this movie were going for. First the movie showed what teenage life is like now. With social media, texting, partying, drinking, drugs and relationships: It was not sugar coded material which is nice I guess. Second, It had some relate to characters. Lola, being a teen trying to live her own life. A mother trying to deal with being a single parent. I would some what say they did a fair job at that. However there is so much bad you can say about this movie. Even though I thought Miley was great in The Last Song however I think her acting days are numbered. I also think her singing career is to but hey this about her acting. I felt like she could have given more to her character as Lola. I also think they lack of character develop could had done that. Again I could say so many bad things about this movie you can read other reviews on their experience of this movie. In short, I would not recommend this movie on less you want to watch something just because. I would recommend Cyperbully which has Emily Osment as the lead. Very emotional movie and a great example what social media is like these days.",

The movie is as if directed by a 12 year old. It's not just that the story line is removed from reality, it's that it is painfully so. One of the things that bothered me about the movie was that it portrayed teen relationships and beahaviour as so stereotypical and centred around the clich\u00e9d \"sex, drugs and rock and roll\" theme. This, among other things in the movie was so removed from reality that it was irritating. Another thing was, it showed female best friends (NOT in a romantic relationship) casually making out on a daily basis as a greeting and it being perceived as completely normal by everyone else in the film. It's a part of the whole \"removed from reality thing\" but very vexing to watch, just the same.If I could give it less than one star, I would. Absolute waste of time and reel.",

But more likely, they intended this to be an edgy teen movie to be consumed by the younger masses. It fails there too though. The conflicts between the characters are weak, and not compelling, to each their own, I just couldn't get into it.

It wasn't a hard part to play but she did well. And all the other characters did well too. Between the original movie and this one, nothing was different except that this one was in English and had different actors. This movie won't change your life by all means, but if you're looking for a romantic teen movie to watch, this one will serve you well.

I am a sucker for these kind of movies and guessing it is for a younger adult/teenage audience, it fit me perfectly. Sure, it's a Hollywood movie, it doesn't mirror real life very well at all, but all those small details in behaviors, issues and thoughts are fun to recognize yourself in as a teenager yourself.The actors were great, I don't know what's up with all the fuzz about Miley, I am not a hardcore fan, but I really enjoyed her performance in The Last song, which was quite a lot a more of a serious movie, but I have no complaints about this one. She plays her roll well and so does the whole cast. It does have a kind of \"Mean girls\" feeling to it, just not as dramatic and extreme, which I find positive because they become a little bit more real. Realistic for being a Hollywood movie.It fulfilled everything I could think of because I can't find anything bad to say about it. It has love and relationships being reflected from different angles; boyfriend-girlfriend, mother-daughter and friendship. I think there can be something for everyone whether you're a little sister or a grandmother, the only requirement is not expecting a Oscar performance movie, but being open about having a few laughs.

There is nothing new here, no serious drama - there are two main lines - teenagers' relationships with their parents and with the opposite sex, with the theme of parents and friendship touched upon a little in the background.The acting was unimpressive - everyone played average. There was a feeling that the cast was chosen only by external data and do not care about the skills of the game, they say that works for teenagers, too. There is nothing to talk about, because all the time we are watching just beautiful faces, who are not able to show any emotions. Sometimes I felt like I was watching a puppet show or a fashion show, although the visuals don't look appealing either - the picture is pale and mundane. Even a city as vibrant and beautiful as Paris is shown here not very attractive.The soundtrack is cheerful - a lot of pop songs that are popular with young people. The music fits well as a background to the narration, without standing out in any way. It sets the tone, softens some roughnesses in the narrative and makes watching more enjoyable.In the end, \"LOL\" is a typical teen drama, with the same problems as shown in a hundred other movies.

The dialog is a bit fast to catch. The directing is a bit hectic. It's nice to see a mother and daughter who love each other instead of just fighting.Only problem is the message it's sending - it's okay to have intercourse at that age? Overall it won't go down as the greatest teen movie but it's okay for one watch.",

If you haven't seen it - well I don't have to explain to you what you should be doing instead of watching this remake ... do I? I hope not.Also while I have no issue with Miley Cyrus in general (she seems like a cool individual), she does seem to old for the role she's supposed to play and cannot carry the weight of many of the scenes ... compared to the original, but also generally speaking. Still this boasts a lot of stars and may therefor be something you want to watch. Also if you don't like subtitles ... but again, in comparison this lacks. Sophie Marceau is so much better than Demi Moore (whom I do like as an actress) ... I reckon you should be informed enough to make your own decision.",

Then I found out Miley was in The Last Song and I wasn't too happy but decided to watch cause the guy was a babe. The first few sentences I heard the nasal voice and I was put off but then I continued to listen and it disappeared and it was like her personality came through and really enjoyed it. From then on I liked Miley.I gave LOL a go because I like Chick Flicks and I'm not ashamed to admit it. This movie is pretty similar to real life, just a little more dramatic (as are most movies).I compare this to Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging. Aimed at younger girls but can be enjoyed by all.

She goes against her mother's wishes and throws a big party. Mind you, she maintains a very strong relationship with her mom through the movie's entirety.Miley Cyrus isn't the best actress, but her role as Lola was believable. I felt like she was Lola and her emotions were in tact.I would compare this movie to Perks of Being a Wallflower in that teens are trying to find who they are among the pressure to drink, pressure to smoke, pressure to have sex, and most of all the pressure of parents to be perfect.I definitely would recommend this movie. I enjoyed it. Not for anyone under, say, 15, but a good movie overall.5/10 because I felt like there could be more action. The whole movie was just about her drinking, smoking, and trying to get revenge on her ex Chad. Even when she goes to Paris, she's just trying to have sex with her boyfriend.

American version is entirely the same movie, just more glamorous and more up-to-American-environment. I don't know if US teenagers are really more glamorous than European, but that makes a slight difference between movies, actually. European version seems more real, while American gives you a hatch to the glamorous life. So every version is better than the other in some way. I guess all the weed is still from European culture, they just didn't want to change the working movie. Or, maybe, I just don't have too many American weed smoking friends, so I underestimate that.So why this huge gap in rating between the two versions? American trolls of Miley Cyrus, I guess.",

I have a petition of 354 people that say LOL should be played nation wide in the USA not just in 7 theatres. It is rather dumb on Liongates part because of the HUGE budget and they aren't putting it out there to get any of the $ back. They should at least give it a try for a week or something.

I couldn't get over noticing how people wrote bad reviews for it before even release date (all of them were posted on the exact same date, so probably one person with more accounts) and I find this stupid. If they'd watch the movie, they'd love it. But, back to the movie. It can relate to every teen. I only watched a few clips of the original (French) one before, but I find this one better. The movie sadly won't win any Oscar or anything, because Lionsgate screwed it. The fact that they lost faith in such a good movie makes me sick. They should definitely promote it more, release it worldwide or something and NOT releasing it after 2 years. Anyway, I'm glad I waited for the DVD. I've watched it about 6 times since yesterday, when it arrived. There's a lot of texting in the movie which is great, between Anne and Lola when they text each other \" (((( HUG )))) ?\" for about three or four times in the movie. You never know what's gonna happen next. 1 hour and a half of the movie went so fast! You should definitely consider watching it and giving it a chance, you won't regret it! :)",

I loved the mother/daughter relationship, it seems so real and true to life to me. And Lola's relationship with Kyle was super cute.

Then you can watch it, if you are okay with Miley Cyrus, not that great of a Demi Moore and your typical Coming-of-age kinda of movie, then you should probably stick around.*If you aren't approving/comfortable with topics of Sex, drugs and you- know-where-else-I'm probably going with this, then you probably shouldn't watch it.In my opinion, most of the reviews concerned with this film were quite harsh. In truth, the film isn't filled with the perfect story line, with a nail-biting plot or anything. *Like I said, it's a coming-of-age kinda movie and you will enjoy this movie if you've liked other films similar to it like, maybe 'According to Greta, the Last Song and other movies that have the similar theme.*The 'Naration' is sort of tacky and the actors may not have brilliant acting skills, well, in my opinion.*Miley Cyrus over does it at times. And then again, she underplays it sometimes. True to rumours, she does try hard to get out of her 'Hannah Montana' shoes and has tried a more maybe-not-really 'mature' look with this one. All the kissing and the sleeping around speak for that. Nevertheless, I'm don't fan girl or hate on her, so I didn't find her role play that hard to digest, as most other \"Hannah Montana\" fans might.*You'll find yourself deeply moved by Douglas Booth's role, that's if you have a 'thing' for men, otherwise you'll see that he's just a good- looking guy with average acting skills, well, at least in this movie.*The character of Lola, is pretty well-established, she's rebellious, dubious, confused, she's secretive, loves her mother and is pretty much your average teenager. Meaning to say, your average-unrealistic, drama queenish-ignorant, movie-kinda-teen. *Demi Moore's role may not be the typical control-freak-mum, as much as you might think while watching the movie. I'm not too sure if her role required exceptional acting skills or not, but to me, she really didn't seem to have taken much of an effort. But then again, this was my first movie with Demi Moore in it, so I won't judge. Okay, maybe not too much.* It's NOT one of the greatest movies of all time.*You should probably go sleep, if you're actually taking time off to watch a movie like this one.",

This movie was legitimately terrible. Firstly, the main character's relationship with her mom is just straight up weird. Literally in the first few minutes of the film she just strips naked in front of her mother. No teenager in their right mind would do that, its just insane. The rest of the movie ranged from cringey, like all of the texting scenes, to straight up confusing. When the main character goes on her trip to France towards the end of the film for some reason her host family consists of a crazy mother and a child who I assume is supposed to be some kind of reincarnation of Joan of Arc. This family also eats brains for no reason, saying that it is the child's favorite food but the child doesn't even eat the brains. My best guess is that this might be a reference to the French version of this film that was released a few years earlier which I haven't seen. However, I think that since this movie is not a sequel or prequal I shouldn't have to watch the other movie in order to understand the absurdity of this movie. As far as the acting goes it was mediocre at best. Miley Cyrus' acting is the same quality as it was on Disney channel, and the supporting actors could easily be seen on a cringey kids tv show right next to her. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, if you're that interested in watching it you might as well just read a 1-Direction fanfic on Wattpad (and yes I know that I didn't even bring up the fact that the romance side of this movie reads like one of those fanfics, but the movie was so bad that it reading like one of those fanfics wasn't even my biggest qualm with it).",

I'm sure the creative team behind this movie didn't mean to make it \"terrifying\", but that's really how it comes off as.

Just throw a hissy fit and you'll get your way, kids! and who cares about grades when you could be losing your virginity to a cute boy (the SOLE objective of our protagonist, Lola)! Simply APPALLED with this movie and those involved. This is the antithesis of a \"coming of age\" movie. In fact, this is the kind of movie you should either refrain from showing teens, or rather for an educational experience show them for a controlled exposure to what true trash is.

The movie itself had some potential as it takes a look at the life of today\u00bfs teenager with quite a bit of realism\u00bfas much realism as can be expected once it's passed through the filters of Hollywood cameras. I like that the movie took the time to add some dialogue via texting. This is a staple method of communication in the modern world, so it added to the realism. I like the way the chose to film those sequences. This is a challenge that filmmakers are going to have to play around with in upcoming movies if they want to incorporate this real-life method of conversation in their movies--how do you making typing entertaining to watch? On top of the bad acting, Cyrus's character was not very pleasant, verging on loathsome at times, as a smack-talking, disrespectful teen. Am I supposed to want things to go her way or not? It's also hard to transition Cyrus who has been typecast as Nickelodeon\u00bfs Hannah Montana in both the series and \"Hannah Montana: The Movie\" (2009) into a character that is openly involved in drugs and sex. Demi Moore did do well as the disgruntled divorcee trying to deal with the reckless teen. The soundtrack was filled with indie rock tunes from bands like Freelance Whales and Keane. Again, what saved this movie from disaster is the fact that, although with a Hollywood twist, these are the everyday problems faced by teens are their families today. I'd like to watch the French film \"LOL (Laughing Out Loud)\" (2008) the movie from which this one was remade.",

High school girl, Lola (aka 'Lol' aka Miley Cyrus), thinks she loves a boy, the boy breaks her heart after returning from summer vacation, girl realizes she actually might love her best friend who's, shockingly, been right in front of her the whole time.  There's some typical teenage drama and mediocre comedic attempts throughout the 1.5 hours but, overall, the film was a total miss, for me.\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure what I was expecting when I decided to watch a movie called 'LOL'.  I can't say that I expected it to be great and it definitely wasn't.  It tries to add unique qualities to a dull (and obnoxious at times), teenage love triangle, story by incorporating a \"social networking\" element to the character's interactions but is more awkward than charming.  Even for a \"high school romantic comedy\" the characters are really flat and, in the end, I wasn't much of a fan of any of them, or their incredibly superficial relationships with each other.\n\nIt's not even a stab at Miley Cyrus or Demi Moore, who play the mother/daughter main characters in the film, because I feel like they could both, probably, do better.  I've definitely seen Demi Moore do better.  'LOL' isn't the worst movie I've ever seen but it's just not that good either.",

It's just a very true message well played and consistent throughout the movie. I didn't payed attention to much to the acting, but I did noticed that even though I have nothing against Miley Cyrus nor I'm a big fan of her, but she was good in some scenes while in others she lacked credibility. On the other hand I enjoyed a lot the presence of Demi Moore, Douglas Booth and Ashley Hinshaw.
