Songs are awesome. This movie is the perfect example of how a movie can be good without heroines and item numbers, or action and romance. Paresh Rawal should get national award for this movie,he gave his best. Akshay had a short role but he was best, he was perfect for the role of Krishna. I thought it will be a comedy movie, but after watching i will say the movie got everything, comedy, emotions, love, humanity. This movie is a delight for movie lovers, only few biased haters can dislike this movie. Entry of Akshay Kumar was awesome. Mithun was awesome, loved his character, but Paresh stole the show along with Akshay. Even God will watch this movie and say OH MY GOD what a movie",

            "content": "WOW, what a film, I was pretty much speechless after i exited the theater. The message this film gives is that god is in every human being, then why do we go looking for him in mandhirs, churches, mosaics, gurdwaras, etc Why has god and religion become a business, why do we spends millions and billions of dollars at religious places as people when we can take that same money and help the poor, won't god be more happy then. This and many more messages are conveyed in this movie through characters, like Kanji Bhai, Krishna, etc Another really plus point about the film is that it is told in a light hearted way, in a comedy, the film isn't very preachy and still conveys its beautiful and real message. For me when it comes to performances Paresh Rawal has just done such an amazing job, he deserves all the applauds, accolades, awards, in the world for his portrayal as Kanji bhai. Akshay Kumar as always is very good in a small but important role, his and Paresh's chemistry is just too good. Other notable performances Mithun, was really good as the sadhu, and so was Govind Namdev. Music was good and suited the film very well. All tech aspects were just perfect. Umesh Shukla the director is the heart of the film and he has done an incredible job, he deserves, a national award for his efforts, he was just that good. A special mention for the amazing dialogues very smart and well written,So all in all this is must watch film for not just the people in India, but for everyone in the world. A masterpiece film, this should be India's official entry to the Oscars. its that good and beyond one of the best movies ever made in bollywood. 10 out 10 rating",

Is a wonderful film with an amazing message that everyone should apply in their lives!Paresh Rawal delivers an outstanding performance, one of his best till date.Akshay Kumar is top notch you can't think of anyone to do his role in the movie.Mithun Chakraborty is fabulous as a fraud preacher.Om Puri, Govind Namdeo, Mahesh Manjrekar and rest have played their roles perfectly.There are some glitches in the movie like abrupt camera work but it has nothing to do with the story or screenplay.Grip makes a movie perfect; That's what happens here, you'll get glued to your seats start to end!I don't know how the play was, but I simply loved the movie.After Watching OMG! My religion is OMG! Oh My God!I'll rate it 8/10 Unmissable especially for \"so called\" religious people wasting time, money, milk and oil at temples.",

Excellent movie with hilarious content.Movie is story of small Gujarati businessman Kanji Bhai superbly played by Paresh who doesn't believe in God. His life take a big turn when he lost everything in earth quake, Insurance company refuses to claim saying this is act of God and can't be claimed.Thus he decided to take big decision and movie is all about that decision.Akshay played role of modern God. If you are thinking that why God is modern go watch a movie you will find a meaningful reason behind it. Akshay is excellent too. Movie criticizes the big business that is based on selling God or we can say playing with emotion of people.God is not in stones or temples. God is in emotions,humans. Do not donate big amount to temples just help the poor and God will be happy. Don't waste your time searching god here and there instead search in humanity. Be fearless and love the God.Must watch",

            "review_title": "A rightful War against Blind Faith,superstition & rituals",
            "content": "Karl Marx quoted \"Religion is the opium of the people\".He tried to say Religion is not the disease, but merely a symptom.It is used by oppressors to make people feel better about the distress they undergo for being exploited.As a child I had grown seeing people trying to find solace in laps of some idol or subjected to some uncanny fear revolving around idols or god-men. I tried to understand difference between rituals & religion. This remained unanswered during my growing years.Omg addressed those tactfully without taking any diplomatic or biased stance on the subject. Adaptation of Gujrathi play \"Kanji virudh Kanji\" which is inspired from an Australian film \"The man who sued the God\",the story revolves around the life of a businessman Kanjilal Shah who is an atheist and ironically his business is that of selling idols of various gods.Being a person with strong self belief he is never naive to fall prey to the traps of rituals & superstitions.In one dreaded night Kanji's shop got demolished due to earthquake and since it is \"act of God\" as per the Insurance terms he is deprived of the claim amount.Shattered and angry he registers a case against God to get his money back.Since God's address is unknown he files case against the God-men, saints as they are supposedly agents of God- and thus begins a hilarious ride as one understands the true meaning of religion.Umesh Shukla's film makes a strong case against blind faith.The film has message for both the ends of the spectrum \u2013 the atheists as well as the believers.The makers of the film has diluted on the complexities of the play to take it to the mass.Even the executions occasionally drift towards melodrama and become loud but then the end justifies the means.The film is meant to reach a larger audience and the often didactic mode of the film strikes a chord.Bhavna Mandalia's dialogs are spot on with ample support from Shukla's screenplay which leaves an impression in many scenes specially the court room sequences and Kanji's interactions with God.The film rightfully highlights on the fake god-men and how they manipulate the weakness and fear of ordinary men for their own benefits.Referring to holy Gita, Bible, Koran the film points out that God believes in equality but the big ashrams and temples will let beggars die under natural calamity but never allow them to enter. In the talk show sequence Kanji reflects on the corruption within such organizations.Subtly referring to Tirupathi he tells how all the Hairs taken are smuggled to foreign land for monetary gains.Even the so called social service done by all such temples and ashrams are just to convert their black money into white analogical to a Gutkha(raw tobacco) company building a cancer hospital (referring to a dialog in the film).He continues how religion makes one bewaas(helpless) or aatankwadi(Terrorist). The film doesn't attack any particular religion but speaks in a general tone.In one scene we find a Hindu priest, a Muslim Malawi and a Christian priest fighting within themselves about superiority of their \"individual\" god,while sadly god himself(brilliant portrayal by Akshay kumar) hopelessly looks at the ignorance of the people.The god-men are either shown ignorant and egoistic or intelligent and manipulative.During the climax, God himself tells Kanji that God is omnipresent and the knowledge of divine truth lies within every human which is written even in the holy books but sadly people don't have the time to read them. Over the years they are manipulated and genesis of rituals happened.Sadly even the educated mass falls prey to this over years.A large portion of violence and in-division are existent due to the distorted concept of religion.In one of the heart warming scene we find people are queuing to pour milk over some stone and the whole milk is going out through the drain while a poor hungry fellow looks helplessly at it.Such huge amount of resources are wasted or misused in the name of blind faith.God exists in all of us.To worship him one doesn't need to go to temples and waste crores of money on idols; but one should help people as Swami Vivekananda said \"Jibe prem Kore jei Jon Se Jon sebiche iswar\" (Bengali) (Those who loves and serves the people are serving the God). Paresh Rawal again proves his competency as an actor and his Kanji will make his position strong among the stalwart actors of the nation.He uses his whole body to emote various emotions.Mithunda is another brilliant actor who can play a disco-dancer or a saint with same conviction. His portrayal of a knowledgeable effeminate saint who uses religious believes to lop off their money is brilliant. He does brings laughter with his gestures and at the same time makes us vulnerable and guilty at the thought of existence of such fake-god men traveling in BMW and speaking of humble existence. Govind Namdeo as the Hindu saint was loud and predictable. He did justify the character he played but could have toned down a bit.Akshay Kumar was restraint and calm which made the audience connect with him as God.Probably this is one of his best performances till date.Om Puri was effective in a small role of Muslim lawyer.The supporting cast were adequate.The characters were too one-dimensional and caricaturist at times but then probably the writer was more concerned on delivering the message than developing them. Low in production value the camera and editing were just about OK.Music was irrelevant in the film though \"mere Nissan\" song had some strong lyrics and apt visuals that would stay with the audience.The dance song \"Go Govinda\" was unnecessary. On the whole this is not a path breaking cinema like Wasseypur or technically excellent like Barfi but it has a strong relevant message that needed to be told and they have done it in a commendable manner to reach to an wider audience.It is a must watch-one.",

This film not only entertains but also enlightens people mind.You are bound to ask certain questions to yourself after watching the film. It thought provoking and your mindset may change after watching the movie. Everything is said in such a gentle and comic manner that the film does not bore a bit. As per acting is concerned well,u can say nothing to the performances by all the character but to applaud and appreciate. Paresh Rawal in the protagonist''s role has been out of the world,superstar Akshay Kumar portrayed the role of Sri Krishna outstandingly,Mithun,Chakravarty,Govind Ramdeo were just fantastic and all other supportive characters lend tremendous support. The main plus point of the film is its novelty in the story,its acting,its direction and the plot.. You are surely getting amazed after seeing such brilliant film and if u miss this then surely you are missing the best Indian film ever. I can and i think no one can give anything less than 10 to this film.",

The movie based on a Gujarati play,is outstanding.It has an excellent story,clever dialogs and amazing performances.In a nutshell,OMG Oh My God! is a movie which should not be missed at any costs! Story: A shopkeeper Kanji Lalji Mehta (Paresh Rawal) takes God to court when his shop is destroyed by an earthquake.The direction is excellent.The dialogs are witty.Performances: Without doubt,OMG Oh My God belongs to Paresh Rawal and Mithun Chakraborty.Paresh Rawal is excellent as the middle-class business man,where as Mithun Chakraborty is mesmerizing as the saint.Akshay Kumar,although having a shorter screen space than Paresh Rawal and Mithun Chakarborty,is significant.Om Puri,Govind Namdeo and Poonam Jhaver are good in their respective roles.All in all,OMG Oh My God! is an excellent film which conveys a powerful message.I am giving it a ten on ten.Strongly Recommended!",

            "content": "Oh my God is a story about a person (Kanji Lalji Mehta) who loses his shop in an earthquake. The shop is located an area in Mumbai, known as chor bazaar. Kanji is a person, who even does not fear God and even puts God on ill usage, for his benefit. After disaster, Kanji lodges complaint against God as he does not get benefit of insurance due to act of God. The notice is sent to all bigger baba's. He first goes through a lot of resistance, but eventually people turn out in his favour. People from other religions also join him. Thus notice is sent to every religious head.Cinematography was awesome. Paresh as Kanji acted well. The build up of the movie and the execution was superb.It's a matter of great controversy that, whatever things people do like doing abhishek, lighting candles, chaddars, etc. Do they come out to be beneficial? The answer to this lies in the quest to understand what turns out to create a pleasant atmosphere in bigger picture. I mean no poverty, equal status to lives, peace of mind, respecting life, creating a better world. This can be achieved by investment of wealth in proper direction i.e for poor.Various religious heads need to understand the method that creates pleasant atmosphere from micro level to major only matters. If we put something in front of God, it should not go waste. Every bit of thing we keep in front of God should be utilized for good in some or other way. Eatables should be utilized for animals if not humans. There should not be any harm done to any form of life. Example Lead in kumkum has been killing animal life in water, which challenges the concept of respecting life. Things of this sort, should not happen. A movie highly recommended.I do kept pace with kanjilal at the ending scene, one of the instances that made me feel special.Rating: 9.5/10",

            "content": "First clearing the air about its inspired status, the team clearly accepts its sources in a detailed caption in the titles, making it all official this time which needs to be appreciated. The caption said that the film is based on a Gujarati play, 'Kanji Virrudh Kanji' or 'Krishan Vs Kanhaiya', which was adapted from the original film \"The Man Who Sued God\" (2001) and then there were two more lines written below it which I couldn't read as it stayed for only less than 2 seconds on the screen. Still it was good to see that the right kind of credits were given to the original creator of the idea as it should be.As an Adaptation of the original film \"The Man Who Sued God\" (2001) The film is actually developed from the basic idea introduced in this lesser known Australian venture featuring Billy Connolly in the lead. And if one has seen the same then he is sure going to give a mixed response to OMG as it somehow reduces the impact generated by the original. Reason being, that in the English film the proceedings just keep moving in and out of the court and that's it. There are no separate tracks of various God-men and there is no Real GOD coming into Billy Connolly's home to make it filmy. In the original we only have a case filed by Billy against the God (involving the Church) catching the phrase \"Damages caused by the ACTS OF GOD\" in the Insurance Company's papers and then its all about the court and arguments given for or against the claim filed the applicant. In short, the film has everything focused on the logical points brought forward by the lawyers along with a beautiful insertion of \"A Sign from the GOD himself\" coming into the court-room towards the end, which serves as a pleasant surprise for the viewers.Plus the original had a brilliant culmination wherein Billy takes his case back, sighting a drastic conclusion for the society whether he wins or loses, which is sadly not there in this Hindi adaptation. Yet OMG scores decently on its own merit with its Indianised version of the concept which remains highly recommended even if you have watched the original flick or play.As an individual film making a new breakthrough in Hindi Cinema. Looking upon OMG as an individual film for viewers who haven't seen the original English film or the Gujarat play, it is no doubt an appreciable attempt by the makers giving us something fresh and new which we have been loudly craving for. Moreover it can also be called a daring attempt by the team, considering our society's conservative state of mind which always gets active when it comes to RELIGION. So in that terms the film successfully manages to make us aware of the so called \"Religious Markets\" strongly functioning around us like big super-malls with different names and titles.Director Umesh Shukla and his writing team adds many good entertaining punches which are able to make you think and laugh at the same time. Hence as it progresses, the viewer largely feels entertained as well as tickled regarding his individual religious beliefs, which I personally consider nothing short of an achievement by the entire team. But at the same time the film has its flaws too. It takes too much time to come to the point and then tries to add too many elements into the narration which were not required. Further, its main publicized theme talking about the GOD himself coming on the earth, seems to be of no use in its basic storyline. So it thankfully remains far away from the Sanjeev Kumar classic YEHI HAI ZINDAGI (1977). In other words, Askhay posing as KRISHNA (and that too on a modified bike like BATMAN) does nothing substantial in the film and is just added to give an extra edge to the project commercially. OMG also loses its grip towards the climax with some overstretched references of Paresh reaching the hospital and then THE GOD giving him the healing touch, which in turn seems to be added just to satisfy the religious sentiments of the viewers emotionally. Performance wise OMG is one of those few films which has its script as the biggest performer in its more than 2 hours of duration. However regarding the cast, Paresh Rawal is as always first rate carrying the entire film on his experienced shoulders, well supported by his entire cast namely Om Puri, Mahesh Manjrekar & Govind Namdeo. Akshay Kumar making his entry just before the intermission looks cute but the scene stealer in the second half remains Mithun Chakraborty as a Spiritual Leader (like never seen before). In reality the few Spiritual Icons shown in the film are based on some highly famous Guru's presently active in the country which you can easily judge without taking any names. Musically OMG doesn't have much scope but even then the producers have added an item song \"Go Govinda Go\" to en-cash the festival season featuring Prabhu Deva and Sonakshi Sinha dancing to the beat energetically. Cinematography and Background Score just serve the purpose well making a decent impact along with the minimal special effects used to showcase The GOD. In the last century, New Age Indian Spiritual Masters like J. KRISHNAMURTHY and OSHO kept saying this for many years throughout their life but very few heard them resulting in the present chaos in the country and world over. So here is OH MY GOD giving the same message to the people once again but deep inside I also know that the situation is never going to change for the very reason that,\"We all are taught to be GOD FEARING and not GOD LOVING people by our so called Religious Teachers!\"",

            "content": "The three best things you will take away from this movie when you walk out of the hall would be story, message and brilliant acting by Paresh Rawal. The movie is adapted from a famous Gujarati play Kanji vs. Kanji, which also had Paresh Rawal in the lead role. The story flow is gripping and you wouldn't want to miss even a single second of movie. With a unique case of a human suing GOD, the direction has been brilliant to keep the story in context and make sense at the same time. While words won't be able to describe Paresh Rawal's acting brilliance, the movie also witnessed impressive performances from Mithun Chakraborty, Govind Namdev and Akshay Kumar. Om Puri, as always, was impeccable even in a brief role. However, the major highlight of the movie is its war against commercialization of religion in the country. The extent of monetary and non-monetary waste to please GOD, not out of love but out of FEAR, has been depicted at various points of time in the movie. It is this fear, that dharma-gurus take advantage of and make billions out of it. And as long as this fear is there to stay, the blind beliefs are also there to stay. While Kanji is an atheist, he is well aware of this and also takes advantage of it in his own way to run his business of God idols. However, he questions this foolishness in the society and the searches the answers as well.In the nutshell, the movie offers a food for thought at the end and, of course, a brilliant movie experience as well.",

This movie not only makes you laugh but its makes you think about the reality. JOB WELL DONE ! I would not like to ruin you movie by giving spoilers. It does not matter what country, religion or caste you are from this movie is a must watch it brings us closer to the reality of being better human. It enables you to be a better person. As mentioned in Geeta its all about karma. Rather then spending time and bribing god you should do good to make him happy. I come from a Hindu sikh family and this movie did not hurt any of my sentiments or my views. It was very well written and director knew that Paresh rawal would be the best person to start with. Akshay kumar was perfect actor to play the modern Krishna he conveyed the message very well. I have written very few reviews on IMDb, because a very few movies makes go that far. Everything I learned from this movie would stay with me.",

It started off ok and had subtle comedic undertones but then it takes a turn for the worst when they introduced magic and gods as characters in the movie. It suddenly became a serious courtroom drama with some of the most unintelligible characters anyone can create for a movie like this. It also makes a complete mockery of the legal system. Even in India, the courts are not this silly. Then there is the final revelation was complete garbage. Basically, take away religion and you become the replacement for religion which is apparently just as bad or worse. What? No, that is not the only possibility yet this is the argument made to keep the institutions. The truth is religions evolve like anything else and in almost all cases, it improves and adapts to human knowledge. How many religions still run espouse virgin sacrifice to an alter? Practically none. This was replaced with animals. How many still sacrifice animals? Practically none. Now you just have to give money and most have become savvy enough to hide the fact that they want your donation by cloaking it as a \"donation\" or to help the needy which are almost always partial lies/truth. But you see, religion evolves and generally gets better. So a reasonable person would actually tell you to tear them down and rebuild. Eventually, humans will get it right. What is right? Coming to the realization that we dont know the real truth and thats ok. There is nothing wrong with not knowing something. Do you see 95% of humans complaining they dont understand why chemical bonds result in an exothermic reaction or that they cant figure out how energy can be converted to matter or how quantum coupling works? No, most simply move on and focus on what we do know. This is when humanity will finally be united. This movie was wrong both from an theist and atheist perspective and it simply wasnt very funny nor was the music memorable which is one fo the things I like in Indian movies...",

Idea is very simple but making it convincing was a very tough job but they succeeded. Performance wise Paresh Rawal is ultimate and perfect at the level that you start believing him as Kanjibhai. Akshay Kumar is good. Mithun Da has done a very surprising character. He adds very minute mannerism to enhance the character. Music by Himesh Reshammia suits the mood of film.

            "content": "This review is about how important this movie is for us.The movie is hilarious and i mean it. It is not the cheap dim-wit comedy that people have been relating to Akshay Kumar since a couple of years. The comedy is 10 star.Some critics have given the movie only 3 and a half stars out of 5. However, I say this movie is beyond the scale of 5 or 10. The reason being the effect it is going to or should leave on the Indian society where people live there lives full of superstitions. It is a message against that. And through sarcasm!!. There are many scenes in the film which will make an impact.Example 1. All the religious heads are in a petrified state because Paresh Rawal has sued the almighty GOD in a court of law. They then decide that if his case against GOD is strong, nothing would happen since people in-spite of being educated and learned in school listen and believe them illiterates instead of what they learn in school.So the message is that we are making it too easy for the mullahs, pundits and likes to create problems for us by blindly believing in and following them. They are not any higher or divine beings and their authority should be abolished. Example 2. Mithun Chakaraborty, tells Paresh Rawal that his efforts are in vain because people are God fearing & not God loving. Therefore they will repeat the social evil i.e. commercialism of faith again and again. That is they will go to temples in search of personal gains (rather than GOD) and will spend a lot of money on superstitions to get things done.They can be easily made into gullible fools until unless they realize that GOD needs nothing except love only from the heart. The only movie after three idiots that manages to deliver a strong message. There are just so many messages in the movie. It is for the masses of all religions and no God(if exists)has been attacked. It will reform you. It will make people more tolerable because it gives a message of sanity and peace. We need an open society. Please change yourselves. Watch the movie carefully and learn.",

Director Umesh Shukla truly pulls off the movie of the year. Seeing the trailers of this movie I was sure this would create a lot of controversy but seeing that it didn't I guess people too accepted the logic behind the plot.The movie is really fast paced and some of the monologues by Paresh Rawal are worth watching millions of times. Akshay Kumar plays his role as \"God\" really well but sometimes takes the good guy character so far that it makes one think would this movie have been better with his part on screen reduced a bit.Even though this movie is a brave attempt considering how sensitive people in India are in subjects related to God still its plot is diluted a bit when it is shown that Kanji realizes that there \"is\" a God .Overall the ending is as good as it could get and leaves one wondering about the situation around.The movie underlines the fact that a good actor can singlehandedly take a movie to great heights.

One such scene where people flock into the temples to offer prasad to Krishna Idol indicates how much people can have blind- faith in religious activity. Hats off to the director to give a film which no one has ever attempted. Based on the popular play , OMG throws surprise with every scene and is sure to be lauded for its daring story.

I also never donate to churches more, and I have never failed to help the poor. I believe that If a person is doing good things in life, good things will happen to him also. Also, if God exists, he is not in the statues, he is there in humans.. Good concept..About acting, Parwesh Rawal was simply superb, he stealed the show. The producers tried to sell the movie with Akshay's starcast in the previews and all, but Parwesh was the real star. Akshay kumar was also brilliant as God.First when I heard about the story about the lead character going to court against God, and Akshay kumar coming as God and all, I thought the film will be another loser. But, after reading some of the reviews, I went to watch this and believe me, its Awesome awesome awesome. So friends, Don't miss this, This is a must watch film.. WATCH IT AND FOLLOW THIS.. Don't SPEND TIME AND MONEY ON STATUES AND ALL.. HELP THE POOR WITH THAT..I also seen one reviewer saying that its copy of \"Man who sued the God\".. Ya, they are showing this in the starting of OMG also. So, don't tell like a cheap copy.. Now all are doing the remakes, but the directors of the OMG presented this well to suit the Indian audience.

How ironic is that in a film that questions the silence of God, it appears, and to meet whom?, the person who doesn't believe in it. They have totally missed the point.The film relies totally on Paresh Rawal (as Kanji Lal). His dialogues are witty and hilarious. He uses perfect analogies every time. The arguments he put in the court may not make sense to you but are totally valid.Paresh Rawal was brilliantly cast here. Role required a person which acts real with a pinch of comedy. And he is a master of such subtle comedy, but I don't think it's one of his best roles.In PK, God was an idea, not a physical entity. But here, they messed things up for the sake of explaining them. Although it's not a total failure, I am waiting for the day India makes a film like The Seventh Seal, which stays true to what it is.",

Coming to OMG now..rather than writing a full review, i will mention its gist just like the acronym it is:1. Another non-chocolaty main protagonist - Paresh Kanjilal Rawal. He is known for putting life in whatever character he dones and this one is no different.2. \"Religion is the opium of masses\" and more so in a diverse nation like ours where the opium comes in different flavours. Making an eye- opener on such a sensitive topic is not as easy as it seems to be. It might appear preachy in patches but nevertheless its like a lecture we get from our parents after we err; and one leaves the cinema-hall with the same guilt. The movie tends to redefine 'God' and 'Religion'.3. Akshay as God might not sound like a believable bet but as the film progresses and by the time it ends one starts looking beyond AK to feel the real Krishna.4. Mithunda (doning looks and mannerisms of Sri Sri) is the surprise package of the movie. His performance as the diplomatic yet feminish religious guru was seriously - kya baat..kya baat...kya baat!!! Govind Namdev tickled through his loudness.5. Other supporting cast seems to be an ensemble of deja-vu characters from TV ads, nevertheless, endearing and non-starry.6. Music is well woven in the movie. Though some people find Go Govinda out of place, I feel, it does add some pace and rhythm to the story. A couple of others like \"Main to nahin\" and \"Hare Rama\" move intertwined with the movie.In all, OMG is a brave attempt from Hindi Film Industry targeting to make people understand real meaning of God, making a call to shun all material and ritual practices and try to find God out of statues.

The strong content of the movie, acting skills of Paresh Rawal,Mithun Chakravarty,Om puri and others have made the movie a tremendous success despite some needless commercialization-tricks and a few weak dialogues. Yes, it is true that the concept of the story is not what we call \"original\" but the importance to point out our narrow perspective as to religious customs was necessary and the movie is successful in that sense. Although the character depicting \"GOD\" was unnecessary and probably was there to make a balance. But the movie has genuinely picked the \"villains\" as these religion-traders are everywhere twisting the original education of religion at their own will, for their own benefit. I would recommend this movie if you too hold humanity above religious fundamentalism.",

A gripping comic drama about the battle of a loner atheist for whom God is futile simply because according to him the way we happen to perceive God is ludicrous and especially because of the institutions, ashrams who swindle money in the very name of God. This movie, in a way, keh-ke-leti's of all those babas, sadhus, saints, institutions that munch money from the innocent public unwavering with their faith, in name of god and questions the notion of donation, lavish physical gifts to temples, churchs, mosques. It very much appealed to me because I have always been the same kind of devotee who believes. OMG, also mocks the mass phenomena that takes the community by storm once an airy larger than life notion is shown about a particular person. Not for once, this movie slows down, it is always a joy ride from start till end. Umesh Shukla deserves applaud for binding this movie so well given the explosive content he has carried out masterfully and the best dialogues, screenplay I have seen in Bollywood since a long time. It's not often you get to see a movie that challenges your opinion, defies your perception and literally shakes your age-old, orthodoxian beliefs from the core. On the acting part, let me admit, I was a bit sceptic because there was logic defying combination of Paresh-Akshay again. But, Paresh Rawal is phenomenal in his portrayal as a Gujju businessman he single 'handily' carries the whole movie on his shoulders with ease. Easily the best role he'd done amongst his last ten movies. Akshay Kumar great to see him back with sense, though I thought he overdone his role a bit at few places. Govind Namdeo is terrific with his role as Siddheshwar baba. Well, yes there are flaws in movie, like Paresh Rawal questions the unscrupulous ways of babas, swamis and in start he makes money by selling statues with fake proposition about their origin. But that's explicable given that God gets even with him ;)Overall, a wonderful movie with a special memo to masses, God isn't anywhere\u0085God is everywhere. 9/10",

Married to a very devout wife, Susheela, and a father of two (a boy and a girl), Kanji is a hardcore non-believer and routinely indulges in activities such as tricking customers into paying huge sums of money for his statues under false pretenses, and drinking alcohol while on pilgrimage. He also disrupts a local festival in order to get his son away from the celebration. The Hindu priest presiding over the function, Siddheshwar Maharaj, shouts at him and says that \"God will curse you\". That night a small earthquake occurs in Mumbai, but there are no damages at all to property or life - except for Kanji Bhai's shop, which has been destroyed completely. Susheela, along with Kanji's neighbours, tells him to accept God so that his misfortunes will end. Kanji refuses, and digs through the shop's rubble to find his Godrej safe, which is still intact. Opening it, it he produces his insurance papers, saying that \"no damage has been done\". However, the next day at the insurance office, Kanji and Mahadev are told that the policy does not cover any damage caused by earthquakes, which are classified as an \"Act of God\".Out of options, Kanji decides to file a lawsuit against God. He eventually visits Hanif Qureshi (Om Puri), a poor Muslim lawyer who was attacked and crippled by Islamic extremists for taking Hindu clients. Qureshi agrees to help Kanji, but warns that since he is bed-ridden without the use of his legs, he can only file the case, and Kanji will have to argue it himself. Kanji agrees, and together they send legal notices to the insurance company, as well as Siddheshwar Maharaj, summoning him to court along with his senior, Gopi Maiyya (Poonam Jhawer) and the group's founder, Leeladhar (Mithun Chakraborthy). Although a Guru of the Sect (credited simply as \"The Pujari\" and played by Arun Bali) asks the three of them to at least arrange a meeting with Kanji and hear out his problem, they refuse, deciding instead to confront him in court.Kanji's plea is accepted by the court , but religious sects come to kill him. Enters MODGOD AKSHAY KUMAR!!! The best thing in the movie. After this the whole movie teaches you a new way to pray. Preaches a message that don't find god in stones , find them in HUmans.Paresh Rawal is fantastic. Akshay Kumar proves himself yet again. Mithun Da is an element of surprise.

On the contrary, it presents a strong opinion about the existence of God. It is probably Paresh Rawal's finest performance since Hera Pheri (2000).The premise is unique - A shopkeeper sues \"God\" when an insurance company denies his claim for his broken shop during an earthquake because earthquake is classified as an \"Act of God\" and hence not covered in the policy. The court then summons religious powerhouses from across the country as the case is accepted and argued in court.Mithun Chakraborty is outstanding as the evil/sissy God man. Mahesh Manjrekar is brilliant as the shyster. Akshay Kumar as \"Krishna\" is likable for a change. It's definitely a must see for all age groups. Go get entertained and enlightened!",

Regarding the film itself, yes it does try to make a point but it really goes its way by spoonfeeding the viewer to make sure they the audience got it. The narrative does slip every now and then. The execution is poor (unimpressive lighting, flat cinematography, dreadful sound design, average art direction, dull editing...). Paresh Rawal does a decent job in the lead role. Ditto for Akshay Kumar (who, by the way, looks hilarious in the Krishna outfit). Mahesh Manjrekar and Govind Namdeo are quite alright but the real star of 'OMG Oh My God' is Mithun Chokroborty who steals the show as a closeted Swami-type leader. His natural flair for comedy shows and the actor displays it with subtlety and excellent timing. Preachy and over the top is OMG.",

The acting by everyone was done well, but Paresh Rawal excelled and gave one of his most convincing performances ever. Akshay Kumar who is my favorite actor had a minor role in this movie and did a good job with what was given to him. The music of the movie was outstanding. Melodious music is rarely seen in Bollywood today (the Kumar Sanu era and before). This music was not only melodious, but it had meaningful lyrics as well. Now down to the topic.The movie is about a man who issues a case against God for causing an earthquake that destroyed his shop. At first I thought he would just find evidence to why God is bad, but what really happens is something that I did not expect. The movie explains how people pray to God only when there is a need to do it or how they bargain with God. However, God is not interested in any of that. He just wants people to be true believers. True believers do not consist of those that partake in such activities where they pour milk down a stone and waste it or give donations to temples for good wishes. It is hard to explain how great of a movie this is. To really understand how great of a movie this is, I urge you to go watch it. The movie can really change your outlook on religious beliefs. \"Be free from fear. Be fearless and have faith in the divine.\"~OMG Oh My God",

Secondly, people should not fear God, but love Him as a friend.Rawal is fantastic in his role, both humorous and serious. Kumar's small but important part is played with gentleness and even godliness. Mithun Chakraborty played a minor character with perfection.

Another movie which i saw today which can be placed at the top of this list is \"oh my god\". Firstly hats of to akshay and paresh for making such a bold film. Most of the time people don't try to attempt this kind of cinema as they think people's sentiments will be hurt . BUT OMG IS MADE in such a way that it not only entertains you but give you the real inside of religious faiths people have in India and what actually happens on the name of religion, without hurting anyone's feeling.Performance wise.... Brilliant Acting by paresh raw al , he portrays the role of a shopkeeper with ease and his court room scenes r just brilliant . Akshay kumar has little to do in the movie but he does justice to his role . I cannot imagine lord Krishna being played by someone else oder than akshay.. But the real surprise is Mithun chakraborty he makes u laugh just with his expressions :-) . On the whole omg is a movie which cannot be missed , it is a movie with a message that makes you think even after the movie is over. Hardly Bollywood makes sensible movies so don't miss this one.... 10/10",

They've even mentioned the crew of that film (Director, Writer, Producers.)The movie is based on mythology, and meant to make us understand the real values and morals. It's a movie that's made to open you eyes, and your minds towards the truth. When Akshay and Paresh team up, you can always expect good.I would suggest this movie to anyone and everyone. We've had every genre of movies of late (Akshay himself, is following this with a \"Khiladi\" flick). This is a more thought-provoking one. If you know someone who is not too happy with oneself/The Almighty, take him/her to the movie and you will be thanked.(The movie is meant to convey a message, and like most moral stories, do not go in, expecting to see a very realistic film. Just cherish the wisdom.)",

Despite some minor hiccups, OMG makes some strong points and leaves a huge impact on the viewer and some of their viewpoints.Plus, the movie talks about possibly the most universal topic out there - God and his existence. However, OMG is not all about God and his existence. In fact, an atheist suing God is merely a backdrop. OMG talks about much more controversial things here. OMG shamelessly discusses the commercialization of religion, especially in India. It may not have done it with full intelligence, however, it's a brave film with a mark.Kanjibhai Mehta is an atheist who runs a shop that sells Hindu idols and \"murti's\". He is an open atheist and believes religion is nothing more than a business. A natural disaster causes only his shop to be destroyed. Kanji is shocked when the insurance company tells him that they cannot recover the losses because the disaster was an \"act of God\". This leads Kanji to sue this \"God\" character. Along his journey, Kanji is supported by a mysterious man named Krishna.There are many hard hitting scenes in the movie. The scene with Paresh selling the murti's, the scenes during the yatra. Not to forget Akhay's scenes with Paresh. The court scenes are outrageous.There are some problems here and there. The main one being that the film at times gets preachy. Also, Akki's intro is a bit stretched. Also, the last 10 minutes of the movie are also a bit stretched.OMG does shed some light into the commercialization of religion in the country of India. The film exploits the truth here for sure.The music is meaningful and fairly enjoyable. Mere Nishan is my pick of the lot.The dialogue is brilliant. Writing is excellent for the most part. Umesh Shukla's direction is extraordinary. Props to him for making such a brave film that too without hurting any sentiments.Performances are also complimentary. Akshay Kumar is there in a special appearance and impresses. Especially in the last few minutes. Mithun is good but acts a little weird at times. Govind Namdeo is good. Om Puri is good. Rest of the cast is good.OMG surely stands on the shoulders of Paresh Rawal. To say he's a fine actor would not live up to the level of talent this man truly has. Rawal sinks his teeth into the role and is nothing short of perfect. Astounding! Overall, it's a film that will make you laugh, make you think and eventually spark a debate. Highly Recommended!",

Running out of options, Kanji decides to file a lawsuit against God. What happens next is hilarious. Hanif Qureshi (Om Puri), a poor Muslim lawyer. Qureshi, a disabled man, helps filing the case as Kanji decides to fight on his own. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company, as well as to religious priests, Siddheshwar Maharaj (Govind Namdeo), Gopi Maiyya (Poonam Jhawer) and their group's founder, Leeladhar Swamy (Mithun Chakraborthy) summoning them to the court as representatives of God on earth.Finally we see Kanji who ends up in front of a group of fundamentalists who try to kill him but he is saved by Krishna Vasudev Yadav (Akshay Kumar) who plays the role of GOD in this film.Eventually we see Krishna Vasudev Yadav giving advice to Kanji in that all of mankind's problems have a solution. That solution is the Bhagwat Gita, The Holy Bible and the Holy Qur'an. Krishna insists Kanji go over these books.Find out what happens next when you watch this film with family, friends or by yourself. If you have hi-speed internet you can watch it Online. Or rent the DVD or go to the Cinema when the price is just about right for you.There is a topic raised by Mr. P. Rawal in that a lot of milk, oil and food is wasted on Hindu ceremonies, which could have been used to feed the poor. I STRONGLY AGREE WITH MR. RAWAL. I also have a slight problem as to the casting of Akshaye Bhatia(or Akshaye Kumar) as the divine Lord Krishna. Hritik Roshan would have better suited in the role. Govind Namdeo is AWESOME as well as my 80's action hero Mithun Chakraborty. There is a good song \"Go Govinda\" starring Prabhu Deva, a dancer whom I respect.If you feel like buying the film, do so. It would be wise to wait a year because as you know new films are coming out at such a rate that the old ones will be sold at half-price and that's when you buy them.",

Besides,how the masses neglect truth in the name of appeasing God & blindly rely on priests for same is clearly depicted.It is indeed a hilarious comedy movie which clarifies the unholy nexus between priests & politicians to loot the masses in the name of God.The movie can leave u with a completely different understanding of Almighty.

Plus, OMG had Paresh Rawal, who is senior than Aamir Khan in every way. PK got the attention of people because of only Aamir Khan. But this should not be the thing that a viewer should look for in a movie. She/he should look for the content in the movie which PK derived from the Oh My God and basically, PK is the combination of Koi Mil Gaya and Oh My God, more or less.",

This could be for no simple reason. My words here will fall short when i try to explain how well Mr Paresh Rawal has acted in the movie. He has acted superbly in the movie, maybe its the characterization of the role he plays, but the connect you will have with him in the movie is what best actors force you to do and Paresh Rawal has done exactly that. Bhavesh Mandalia has done full justice as a writer. Hindi movies are always characterized by \"Who is the hero in the movie?\" I'd say its the Dialogues, very nicely written dialogues.All the actors have done well Om Puri, Akshay Kumar (Small but a very decent role compared to the movies he has been doing lately)and others.Coming to the story, its no ordinary story, \"An antique shopkeeper takes god to court when his shop is destroyed by a tornado\" is what IMDb has said as a preview. The movie is about why the main lead does that and what he gets in return or returns to the society. The movie is not a laugh riot but throughout the movie you wont loose your smile.Please do watch the movie, the movie has a very good message for us Indians.PS: If you liked this movie and Paresh Rawal in particular, please do watch Road to Sangam :)",

Of course, this effort washes away the ill will and the mental torture endured while watching JOKER. And of course, the cherry on the icing was Paresh Rawal in the role of Kanjibhai.

Although play was raising issues about organised religion in India, it had got lost in its own argument.

The main focus is how we are cheated by malpractises in the name of religion for money. The film is a satire, inspired by a play Kanjibhai vs God The film starts off well with Paresh's character well introduced, the scene where he clashes with Govind Namdeo a bit corny yet well handled, the twist is superb too and then the entire God vs Paresh angle is well handled. The best part is Paresh's character is shown very realistic and his problems are identifiable, though the Godmen are shown as carricatures and several scenes are theatrical too but the message is well presented. The scenes were Paresh confronts Govind Namdeo, Mithun in the courtroom is superb, The pre-climax however is not only prolonged but also could be written better though the climax is good Direction by Umesh Shukla is good Music is good, Go Govinda track wasn't required though rest songs are goodParesh Rawal is simply outstanding, for a man who off recent was doing rubbish roles it's nice to see him play a twisted role though he has played it in the play before, he adds a lot to the character and is superb Akshay Kumar is releagated to the background and does his part ably though his character could be more effective Mithun excels as the evil godmen though his gestures do tend to get repetitive at times, Govind Namdeo is back to hamming and loud acting after subtle act in HEROINE Mahesh Manjerekar is good and thankfully doesn't overact Lubna Salim as Paresh's wife is decent, Om Puri leaves a mark in a short role, Nikhil Ratnaparkhi is superb as Mahadev Murli Sharma, Arun Bali are adequate",

This lack of quality leads to the majority of American religious films to be called \"bad\" even if the viewers widely agree with the films' messages.Until watching OMG, I had never considered that other countries might have their own bad religious films, so I appreciate the movie opening my eyes to that. So the message is certainly a good one (to an extent), and the movie is certainly a bad one. The plot was decent if not predictable, and the acting served its purpose even though it was never particularly convincing. The only part that was truly awful was the screenplay. The writers had clearly never been in any sort of courtroom before, nearly all of the main character's points used flawed logic arguments, and none of his interrogators could come up with even the simplest counterpoints. I don't necessarily blame the writers because the heart of the message can eventually be argued as truth (again, to an extent), but truly convincing the viewers would require a debate lasting far longer than any movie's runtime. However, the producer is definitely to blame for attempting to tackle such a massive concept in such a short film.",

It's entertaining, clever and humorous at times, also difficult at times because of the topic. It's a very daring movie, challenging the social system, active tradition. Paresh Rawal was terrific in his portrayal of a character who is in quest for truth and justice.What did not work:\nsome of the scenes are gloried for dramatic values which was the need of the movie considering it's point but some were difficult to watch. It's a movie against the system but some scenes were more hurtful than others. The stereotypical sanths and gurus, their vested interest is a bit cliche but a need of the narrative.Final verdict: recommended",

Trust Paresh Rawal to tickle your funny bone with his very realistic performance of a common 'dukandar' taking on the powers of representatives of God! The script is tight with powerful dialogues. Akshay Kumar is hilarious in the role of God. Mithun Chakraborty once again proves his acting skills this time as a gay God Man! All in all, a real time pass movie with a message.

He openly mocks religious practices and traditions, and ostensibly as a result, suffers from his shop being demolished in an Earthquake.Thankfully, he is fully insured, and tries to approach his insurer. But not-so-thankfully, his claim is denied as the damage is considered an 'Act of God', for which the insurance company is not liable.Frustrated and angry, Kanji decides to sue God. He files such a claim using cleverly laid logic. If it is indeed an act of God, then God is responsible for the act, and should be held liable through his many agents (Hindu priests, Christian pastor, etc). Either they accept responsibility and settle his claim OR they dispute the act of God clause, which should get the insurance companies to pay up.But Kanji's lawsuit triggers political reactions and crowd anger. Kanji is chased by angry mobs when he is saved by the sudden appearance of Krishna Vasudev Yadav, who is a modern incarnation of the Hindu God Krishna. In this universe, God exists, but is also mad at the charlatans who misguide people in the name of religion, and therefore supports Kanji's efforts.The movie is well scripted, well acted, and has a very funny, at the same time social aspect to it. It ends up being a pro-theistic, but anti-religion film, and I'm very pleasantly surprised that it did well in India. It's supposed to be based on a Gujrati play, but seems to be a remake of the 2001 Australian movie 'The Man who sued God\"; a funnier, more entertaining, theistic version of it. Overall, a superb movie.",

Akshay Kumar has a very likable cameo as Lord Krishna. The way he bonds with Kanji in his house is beautiful. The bike which he uses is a killer though his intro stunts on the bike are poorly executed but we can live with that.So overall the movie is a Good Watch and Highly Recommended.My Ratings - 10/10",

Today the common people are fooled & extorted in the name of God, & we accept it out of fear. But God is not someone to be afraid of. God stands for Smiles, for Peace, for Happiness.

            "review_title": "OH MY GOD - A superb message oriented satirical comedy film",
            "content": "Through the movie - Oh My God, its director (also the writer) Umesh Shukla has conveyed a beautiful message that we should believe in God but not in blind superstitions The exploitation of innocent people by persons who claim themselves to be God-men is depicted in a beautiful way. The highlight of the film is that there is a perfect mix of comedy and philosophy and it completely involves each and every one in the movie till the end.The story revolves around a middle class atheist shopkeeper - Kanji Lalji Mehta (played by Paresh Rawal) who loses his shop owing to an earthquake. Kanji then goes to claim his insurance but the insurance agents reject his claim saying that his shop was destroyed in an earthquake which is supposed to be 'Act of God' and hence he can't claim the insurance. Being deprived of his income and running out of options, Kanji finally files a lawsuit against God and demands the religious heads who acquire money in the name of God to bear his insurance loss. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company as well as the religious heads and the trio of persons who claim themselves to be God men - Siddheswar Maharaj (played by Govind Namadeo), Gopi Maiyya (played by Poonam Jhawer) and Leeladhar Swamy (played by Mithun Chakraborty) get involved in the story and this lawsuit of God becomes an issue of national interest. The religious heads try to kill Kanji and thats where Lord Krishna(played by Akshay Kumar) comes to his rescue and the remaining movie is a depiction of how He helps Kanji in his legal fight with the religious heads and the message He wants to convey the entire world through Kanji. Totally, the movie re-emphasizes the old proverb - 'GOD HELPS THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES' through a plot filled with humour and sarcasm.Coming to the performance of the actors, it was an outstanding performance from Paresh Rawal in the lead role and Mithun Chakraborty was also equally good in the negative role. As usual, Akshay Kumar was impressive with his role as a modern God. Other aspects such as dialogues, screenplay and background music were also good and I definitely say that it is a must watch movie for each and everyone. Finally, I would say that in this era where nine out of ten films are purely commercial, it is our duty to encourage these kind of movies which would boost the confidence of directors like Umesh Shukla and help them to come up with more innovative movies in the future which would be a blessing for Bollywood.",
