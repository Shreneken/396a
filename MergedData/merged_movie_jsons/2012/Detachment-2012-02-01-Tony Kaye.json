            "content": "Wow! I was not expecting this movie to be this engaging. Its one of those films that leave you sitting in silence for a while when the credits roll much like excellent Dramas like \"Requiem for a dream\" or \"Downloading Nancy\".This one spells it out pretty clear with the line \"Henry Barthes is all of us\"... its hard to grasp how the realization that we are indeed all the same can be so painful.On the surface \"Detachment\" deals with the crumbling American education system through the eyes of substitute teacher Henry Barthes (played by Adrian Brody) who starts a new assignment in a new school with new teachers, in a new class with new pupils like he is obviously used to.The beginning shows him trying to get into this new class around the bullies threatening him and other pupils, making it hard to teach anything. At first it looks like all those \"good teacher turns around a bad class\" movies but its not. You soon realize that the school is just the backdrop for a larger story about a teacher who tries to do his job by taking a role outside the play. Barthes makes clear that he is hollow and words can't hurt him which is his way of coping with a hopeless situation by neglecting his private life and detaching from the world. Like him every teacher seems to have developed his individual coping mechanism. For some its cynicism and dark humor, \"happy pills\" are regularly mentioned too and for others its just swallowing their emotions until they erupt. You see the teachers coping with their daily routine while hearing an answering machine in the background every now and then with other teachers resigning or parents shouting for better grades for their kids.Its pretty tough stuff seeing kids void of hope, interest or enthusiasm and teachers trying to get to the few who are still to be reached in the classroom. But its here where it all falls apart because of hollow politics, parents that do not care or are just as dysfunctional as the kids they raised and dropped into the public education system and idiotic social rules and conventions we are all used to. When you see the pattern in all the peoples private lives and their desperate tries of holding on its obvious that \"Detachment\" is not just about the public school system but about our whole society, about each and every one of us.When Barthes meets a young street hooker he decides to take her in with him and do his job outside school. Its quite heartbreaking to see him trying to make a change against all odds. At times Barthes comes across like a modern day Jesus when he sleeps on the floor of his small apartment and lets the girl sleep in bed. Some might say that \"Detachment\" is too light on the teachers because most of the blame falls onto parents and politicians. There is hardly an unsympathetic teacher in this movie. Yet there are scenes that show Barthes is no Jesus at all... like when he violently shouts at a nurse in a retirement home after an incident with his dying grandfather. Barthes is indeed like all of us, cracking when he struggles to cope and lashing out to get out the pressure, just like the parents at school push their pressure to the teachers.And this is where the detachment cracks... amidst all the failures Barthes manages to connect to the girl, as well as to an outcast girl at school. And he connects through emotion and personal attachment but soon has to realize that it does not work. The scenes of him sending away the girl to a foster home when he tells her he cannot be her family or when he has do send away the outcast girl when she tries to share her sorrow with him are gut-wrenching. There are so many honest and deeply emotional scenes in this movie its hard to keep track. His grandfathers death with his total forgiving, Barthes monologues trying to make the pupils understand why they need basic education for their own sake are as brilliant as Lucy Lius Characters breakdown in which she shouts out her desperation and sadness towards a seemingly not caring girl.The relationship between Barthes and the girl is stunning and constantly rocked by misunderstandings... plain because you don't expect it to be non-sexual with all the pedophile stories, sexual harassment laws and stereotypes. But against all odds it is and you realize that when there are no parents (like in the haunting \"parents night\" scenes with teachers waiting and no one coming) someone else must fill this void... how empty have we become that we cannot expect someone to help out of honest interest for his fellow man... or rather child?!\"Detachment\" is a bleak and painful movie but it has some hope and even some humor (the cynic teachers way of teaching a girl about the dangers of STD with a picture of a rainbow and a picture of a disease ridden vagina is one of those much needed lighter moments).Its like when Barthes says in one of his many off commentaries... life is an ocean of chaos and the realization that you are the one supposed to throw the buoy while struggling to stay afloat is devastating. But its the honesty about his own struggle that makes him connect with others. Its when they realize we indeed are all the same, all struggling and they are not alone in their strife that gives them their humanity. But thats what life is... so what can you do but be honest and hope for the best.... Its all going to be OK!",

            "review_title": "Desperation and Despondency as a Wakeup Call",
            "content": "I had no idea how ill prepared I was to experience \"Detachment.\" Here is a film that plunges headfirst into the depths of disillusionment, despair, and failure and almost never resurfaces for air. You will experience emotions normally repressed during movie watching. You will be saddened, shocked, and above all, angered. You will see things you wouldn't ever want to see and hear things that should never be heard. You will wade through a sea of bleakness, desperately searching for some small shred of hope to cling on to. At the end of it all, you will be so psychologically drained that, for a time, it may seem as if you will never be happy again. At the same time, you will also get to thinking, and that's exactly why I'm recommending this movie so highly.A few months ago, I snubbed my nose at the critically acclaimed thriller \"The Grey,\" an equally hopeless and depressing but also nihilistic story about men who must fight against wolves, and themselves, in the snowy Alaskan wilderness. Unlike that film, which reduced its compelling ideas into a cheap and shallow thriller, \"Detachment\" uses its desperation and despondency to make a point. I don't see it as a movie so much as a wakeup call, a way for audiences to understand not just the world but themselves as well. At its essence, it's an examination of behaviors that are perpetuated by people that have the power to stop it. It might not seem like they have the power. In fact, it might seem like absolutely everything is working against them. There's no question that rising above adversity is a challenge. Nevertheless, it's one that must be faced.The main setting is an inner city public high school, one that exemplifies with horrifying detail the failure of the No Child Left Behind act of 2001. Most of the students are poorly educated, violent, and foulmouthed. They have no respect for others, but more to the point, they have no respect for themselves. They have, in fact, degenerated into pure apathy. This has rubbed off on the faculty, for they know that all their years of teaching and guidance haven't made the slightest difference. They're constantly berated by furious parents for being so lousy at their jobs. It's almost as if they have relinquished themselves of the responsibility of actually raising their own children. Is your son or daughter a problem? Don't take the necessary steps of working towards a solution \u2013 simply dump them off at school and let the teachers do the dirty work.Bearing witness to all of this is a substitute teacher Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody). He struggles to make a difference, all the while knowing that he's failing miserably. He sees nothing but people who have given up, and he's within of inch of giving up on himself. His personal life is a mess; his grandfather (Louis Zorich), in the advances states of some kind of dementia, languishes in a nursing home staffed by people who simply don't care. He has flashbacks of a childhood scarred by the absence of a father, an alcoholic mother, and a deep tragedy. He eventually takes in an underage prostitute named Erica (Sami Gayle). He's saddened by her situation and even helps her in a few important regards, but he doesn't coddle her like a frightened puppy. He wants to get through to her that she has value as a person, that she's so much better than giving oral sex to men on the bus. He's also tortured by the fact that their arrangement can't last forever.Several distinguished actors make appearances in this film, mostly as faculty members. These would include Marcia Gay Harden, Tim Blake Nelson, James Caan, Lucy Liu, Blythe Danner, Christina Hendricks, Isiah Whitlock, Jr., Bryan Cranston, and William Petersen. All are in various stages of professional and personal breakdown; Nelson plays a teacher who isn't noticed by anyone, Caan plays an administrator who can only get through the day on medication and biting wit, and Harden plays a woman who knows that the end is near. In one of the best scenes, Liu lashes out at a student for her disrespect and indifference at her own future. She gets nothing but kids like this day in and day out. What is the point of pointing out their academic shortcomings when they obviously won't take the steps to better themselves?Of all the actors that appeared in the film, the most compelling is Betty Kaye as a student named Meredith, who observes the school through the lens of her camera. She creates dark collages with her photos. Her creativity is labeled by her unseen but clearly heard father as unnecessary teen angst. Believing only beautiful people are worthy of attention, he cruelly harps on her about her overeating, the way she dresses, and her social isolation. Meredith, an intelligent young woman, makes a connection with Barthes. Unfortunately, her self-esteem is so low that she misinterprets his encouragement as personal affection.The film intercuts linear scenes with multiple narrative techniques, none more resonant than Barthes' documentary-style confessionals. The final scene begins with him reading the opening sentences from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" which should already tell you everything you need to know. The message of \"Detachment\" is simply one of responsibility and caring. If you're a parent, nurture your children and allow them to be themselves. Don't expect a school system to raise them for you \u2013 as they say, education begins at home. Before you point out someone else's flaws, first recognize your own. Understand that you're not perfect. Be thoughtful of others. And above all, know that you matter. There is no tragedy deeper than giving up on yourself.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",

            "content": "Henry Barthes (Adryen Brody) is a high-school substitute teacher emotionally detached from everyone but his grandfather. When he was a seven year-old boy, he saw his mother committing and he is a traumatized and sad man. Henry is assigned to work for one-month in a decadent public school and along this period, he meets the teenage prostitute Erica (Sami Gayle) on the streets and he brings her to his apartment to take care of her. In his class, he feels affection for the troubled student Meredith (Betty Kaye) and tries to help her. These adolescents change his emotions toward people. \"Detachment\" is a depressive view of the sick and dysfunctional modern society though the routine of a substitute teacher that makes the difference in the universe of teenagers, parents and other teachers. There are memorable scenes, like the breakdown of the counselor Dr. Doris Parker (Lucy Liu); or Henry explaining to the students the importance of reading to create their own thoughts and beliefs; or Henry saying that parenthood should require curriculum. On the other side, the reaction of Ms. Sarah Madison when Henry is hugging Meredith is impressive and part of a morally corrupted society that only can see vicious in a sympathetic gesture. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"O Substituto\" (\"The Substitute\")",

            "content": "Saw this at a local film festival with little to no information about the movie whatsoever; little did I know this was going to become my favorite film of the year, and that's saying a lot given that 2011 has been a blast for moviegoers with new products by Woody Allen, Terrence Malick, Lars Von Trier and Clint Eastwood.The movie revolves around an poignant substitute teacher (perfectly played by Adrien Brody) who arrives at a vicious school, where students go around bullying people (including the teachers) and basically throwing their lives directly to the dumpster\u0085you know, teenage angst and such\u0085I didn't grow up in the USA, so two important things I must say, a) I don't know if this is an accurate depiction of any given school in America and b) I can't relate with the overall chronicle, which brings me to my next point.The beauty of this movie comes within the subtext, whether you can directly relate with the characters or not, the movie takes the message and widens its range so everyone is able to understand the actual meaning of the film. Let's clear things out, this film is not about a school or the basis of education, this is about trying our best not to give a damn about others as most of us just go around doing everything in our power to be happy ourselves with a lousy job, a loveless marriage, a constant sense of abandonment or basically a crappy life (all of the above portrayed marvelously in the film).Films by Tony Kaye tend to be really visceral with a thin slice of optimism in the undertones, I think this time he just went mental about everything, in the end you'll leave the theater with a slight sense of hopelessness, almost as if you're destined to watch daily misery without the power to control anything but your own life, as if the only battle you must fight is the constant reminder that even when everything falls apart and slowly turns into dust, you can't change the world, you just have to avoid the world from changing you\u0085This exposed stunningly in the final sequence of the movie.Do yourself a favor, watch this film!",

My opinion on this film may be biased, solely on the fact that I only enjoy films that touch the heart and soul (or at least makes me think/feel) and this is one film that made me want to go out and change the world for the better.This film is well worth while to watch from beginning to end. The Academy needs to look into nominated Adrian Brody for an Oscar with this performance.

            "content": "I saw this originally in a theater and then again on VOD. I loved it right off and rated it a 9, but it was a movie I just couldn't get off my mind. The cast was outstanding, especially Brody, and the one that kept bringing my thoughts back to it, Toni Gayle as Erica in her first feature film performance. As the director Tony Kaye said, hers was the first character he cast because she is the central pin for the story--amazing given a cast loaded with familiar faces and names and incredible talent.I can't say too much about the story without spoiling it. It does have memorable dialogue, a very interesting story, and humor is not absent but I think is suffers with audiences because the central character, Brody, is a deep person with a lot to offer but is stuck in a sad, shallow outward personality. If I'd had to leave before the end, I might well not have gone back to finish it. Others have watched it thinking it was going to be another \"American History X\", but they're just two different movies, both with something big to say, this more so even than X in my opinion. My only minuscule nit to pick is I'd rather have had Brody do the head shots as voice over narration. Above all, if I didn't say anything else I'd say this....stick with it.The only flaw associated with this movie given all is positives is criminally atrocious marketing. It's like displaying Van Gogh's \"Starry Night\" in the basement of the Museum of Modern Art where only the occasional patron wanders in and happens to lift its covering. To help the reader judge how I weigh film ratings, I've seen between 5-10,000 movies, but this is only my 14th 10/10.",

            "review_title": "An unnerving yet brilliant account of the education system and its teachers",
            "content": "As classroom dramas go this may well be one the finest I have ever seen. A compelling insight into Americas failing education system and the beleaguered teachers that inhabit it.The story centres around Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher who spends three weeks at a high school where the students are as troubled as their teachers. Barthes, portrayed brilliantly by Adrien Brody, finds himself surrounded by individuals who have become jaded to the point of breaking. His tale becomes even more complex when a chance encounter with a teenage prostitute, Erica, develops into an unconventional friendship. It's within this custodial dynamic that we see some of the films most poignant and heartbreaking moments, as well as some outstanding acting from Sami Gayle, who plays the vulnerable young girl that society has abandoned. The film employs a three part cutaway technique with Henry Barthes providing a narrative in the form an interview, as well as flashbacks to his childhood - which allows us an insight into why he such a brooding and melancholic character. The flashbacks are often juxtaposed with scenes involving Barthes grandfather with whom he visits in hospital through out the film. The third cutaway is an animated chalkboard sequence which I felt conveyed a sense of culpability and lost innocence.The film also boasts an extraordinary supporting cast; including James Caan, Marcia Gay Harden and a very brief appearance from Bryan Cranston, as well as a surprisingly fine turn from Lucy Liu- the schools doctor. The staffs sense of disillusionment and frustration, due to the students perpetual indifference to their own fate, is vented brilliantly by Liu in a scene that begs the question; \"where, and when, did it all go wrong?\" Though dealing with very bleak subjects and despite the characters ceaseless sense of defeat and abject loathing for their profession, there are still some heart warming moments in the film. And though it offers no suggestion as to how we can amend such failings in our education system, and that parenting has in so many avenues of society become bereft of any moral guidance and adequacy, it still left me reassured that there are those who are still prepared to undertake such a daunting and thankless task.If you're looking for an entertaining piece then I suggest you look elsewhere, but if you wish to see a brilliantly thought provoking film that raises more questions than it provides answers, and you're prepared for some uncomfortable moments, then you'll be rewarded with a film that is excellently written and directed and has some outstanding performances.

His grandfather is in a nursing home and close to death. He has no other family and the only job he can get is substitute teaching. After taking a position at a severely under preforming school he does everything he can to make a difference. Finding a way to connect to the kids is not only what they need, but also a way for him to find out who he is. There have been a ton of movies about a teacher who comes in to try and \"fix\" the students. Even including the true stories \"Dangerous Minds\" and \"Lean On Me\" this is easily the most realistic portrayal of a teacher trying to help I have ever seen. Not wanting to give anything away it's not a movie where he comes in and starts to rap and all of a sudden everyone gets A's, nor is it him coming in and being a hard ass until everyone \"gets it\". This is what most teachers would try and do I think and I didn't think it was possible but this movie give me more respect for what they go through on a day to day basis, most of which is unnoticed or unappreciated. This is a movie that you just need to see, and every high school kid who thinks he is a \"thug\" needs to see and understand. As well as parents who seem to not care about their kids education.

But then who's gonna live happily forever!!Though the education system and the schools and the students ain't that evil and rotten the way its shown in the movie, it does pose many a question, the dubious system in which everything goes on without a point. The miserable life of teachers were beautifully shown, yes they do go through worse situations. Adrien Brody does something meaty after pianist as the cool, composed and ailing substitute teacher. The climax was so dramatic and metaphorical, the background score adds value to the visual richness.The screenplay is too dark at times, the lighter moments and the virtuous elements highly underplayed though it saves the movie many a time from drowning.

            "review_title": "a powerful and moving tale of a substitute teacher and the intersecting lives in a high school",
            "content": "Tony Kaye is not known for having happy-go-lucky tales that leave you feeling better about the status of our world. Even in light and glorious colored shots, Kaye tells stories with deeper inner conflict and demanding commentary about our society. His most famous work, \"American History X\" (a project that he famously wanted his name taken off of after being upset by edits star Edward Norton made to the film), was a film that showed these dark struggles and issues in a film about a neo- nazi group and their attitude towards the world.In his new film, \"Detachment\" (a film he has kept his name on), Kaye and first time writer Carl Lund tell the story of a substitute teacher who travels from school to school trying his best to help the lives of his students, his own life, and the community he is in. The substitute is Henry Barthes, played by Adrien Brody, who is a man that has his own inner struggles and past conflicts that he fights with day-to-day. But Henry must try to put these issues aside when he enters the classroom at this school; a school at which the students don't care, the teachers struggle to educate, and everyone takes a toll from the experiences.What Lund does so brilliantly in his writing is creating a story that doesn't give one perspective of the situation. He tells the story through the eyes of Henry, the students, the parents, and even a young prostitute Henry befriends. In fact, even as Henry is the main character of this story, we still get perspective from many of the other teachers (played by James Caan, Tim Blake Nelson, Christina Hendricks, Blythe Danner, Lucy Liu, and Marcia Gay Harden). The student stories range from a young girl who struggles with weight problems, parents pressuring her, and bullying to students who act tough and thug and threaten harm to the teachers. What results from this is a multi-faceted story that gives many perspectives and tales. Like \"The Wire\" inside a high school.As the tale moves along, we get to know each of these characters deeply and care for them a great deal. From the relationship that forms between Henry and the young prostitute named Erica to the conversations between teachers discussing how they could be better, the film places us within this harsh world of a school and asks us what can be done about bettering our youth, bettering our communities, and bettering ourselves.The film also touches briefly and comments on the outside factors that affect day-to-day school life. From advertisements and social norms telling us how we should act and who we should be to apathetic parenting that leads to a Parent Night with almost no attendees, Kaye and Lund construct a film that demands us to want more, shows us some of the factors that lead to these problems, and confesses there are no easy answers. As Henry begs his students to think for themselves and care for something more than just them, Kaye and Lund bring in the outer conflicts that impact these kids and cause the inability for them to think this way. This is no easy road with a simple answer. It is complex with many different intersecting avenues.Outside of the strong construction of the story by Lund and the beautiful cinematography and strong directing from Kaye, this film also benefits deeply from the acting performances, specifically from Adrien Brody. While Caan, Nelson, Hendricks, Danner, Liu, Harden, and newcomers Sami Gayle (Erica) and Tony's daughter Betty Kaye (the bullied Meredith) are all brilliant, Brody is absolutely enthralling. While Brody's career has not blown up since his Best Actor Oscar for \"The Pianist\" (a few Wes Anderson films, \"The Brothers Bloom,\" \"King Kong,\" \"The Village,\" \"Hollywoodland,\" and \"Splice\" on the short and not extremely noteworthy list), he is so powerful and strong in \"Detachment.\" With the ability to say so much with so little and controlling every scene he is in, Brody reminds us why he is an Academy Award winner while making us laugh and cry with him throughout this film.\"Detachment\" is an extremely effective and emotional tale that will both warm and break your heart. The story lines of the film intersect and converge like a graceful car crash. The pain of one interaction morphs into the joy of a different one. Haunting memories of the past bring up pain in the present. With careful construction of the world of this school, along with Kaye's masterful direction and photography and some brilliant thespianism by Brody and the rest of the cast, \"Detachment\" is a film that can impact a person in so many ways. Just as Henry tries to have an influence on all the lives he meets in the short period he substitutes, so does Kaye educate and ask questions to his audience and demand that we think a little more about ourselves, those around us, and the community we are all a part of. That we must not stay detached, but become an important and productive member for ourselves and everyone around us.Read more Film reviews and more at CustodianFilmCritic.com",

            "content": "The truth about high school is that it's worse than you remember it.Watching Tony Kaye's enthralling \"Detachment,\" you can't help compare your high school to the one on screen. You remember the terrible teachers you had, the sterile hallways, the asinine classmates, and the absurd assignments. You can remember the \"weight that presses on everyone\" as Mr. Henry Barthes, played by Adrien Brody, tells his class.\"If you can just hang on, everything will be alright.\" Mr. Barthes is that hero teacher that we love tell stories about. He's the Christ, the Buddha. He's meant to save us from ourselves. The problem? Mr. Barthes is a great teacher because he has no life outside of teaching. Like Socrates, Christ, Buddha, Gandhi, and countless other mythologized teachers, Barthes is a detached island to himself, without spouse, children, or personal life. He's a lonely dude.As a public school teacher sitting in the audience at the world premiere last night in Tribeca, I have mixed feelings about telling you that Tony Kaye has masterfully succeeded in capturing public school in a macabre and beautiful chalkboard sketch. His lush, mannerist portrait brings a gorgeous but searing light to the lonely reality of the teaching profession. Mr. Kaye's \"Detachment\" presents school the way so many of us on the inside see it: a windswept wasteland scourged of its humanity by a culture that burdens its underfunded and unfairly censured teachers with rearing, policing, and institutionalizing our children. I hate to say it: public school really is this bad. The few great teachers that our system manages to attract are barely hanging on from year to year, knocked senseless by a society that demands way too much from them.Adrien Brody is riveting as a seemingly serene but deeply damaged substitute teacher. His sloping eyebrows, sometimes treacly or overwrought in other performances, here convey an- inch-from-the-cliff hopelessness without ever becoming a mask. Mr. Brody's Henry Barthes is sweetly but searingly honest with his students even as sadly skulks among the halls of his school. Barthes is also furious-- enough to throw desks in his classroom and scream at a late night nurse at his grandfather's assisted care facility. In close-up, documentary-style interviews, Mr. Brody's eyes flash like lightning one moment and then become as dull as concrete the next, daring us to try to understand how one can care so much and so little. His Barthes has a teacher's countenance in this film, acutely aware of how important yet futile his work is. It's a career performance.Barthes' determination to be disconnected keeps him the perennial substitute-- in the classroom and in his personal life. Barthes tends to his grandfather but has more than enough time to help out two young girls, a young prostitute and an overweight loner. Despite his earnest efforts, almost none of it works out well. The complicating plot lines, all involving family surrogacy around Barthes, serve the notion that teachers must be dispassionate and alone in order to perform their jobs. The story survives its few yet regrettable school clich\u00e9s by sticking to this thesis. Despite the fact that the number of big names threatens to make the movie look like a cameo-fest (Lucy Liu? Christina Hendricks? Marcia Gay Harden? Blythe Danner? James Caan? Really?), the ensemble gels together surprisingly well. After all, weren't your teachers an impossible cast of characters? Every character seems just barely above water as each trudges to the blunt beat of the school bells ringing. The performances are just fine, largely, but two are particularly successful. While Mr. Caan's grinning jester provides a refreshingly necessary gallows' humor in some of the film's darkest moments, it's Ms. Liu's imploding truth-teller that lends undeniable heft to the story. As a guidance counselor faced with yet another unreachable know-it-all teen, Ms. Liu's character finally breaks down, berating the student with a bleak prophecy of the child's future. \"You will NOT be a model! You will forever be on a carousel, competing with 80% of the country for a minimum wage job for the rest of your life!\" the guidance counselor screams uselessly at the apathetic teen.It's grim stuff, made more grave by the undeniable ring of truth.The ancient Greeks tell us \"we suffer our way to wisdom.\" By the end of the film, you'll hope that is true for most of these characters. Somewhere on screen, between a silent hug and the opening lines to Poe's \"Fall of the House of Usher,\" you will find a glimmer of hope. But you have to work for it. School, as the film has drawn it, is a Munch-esque desert of detachment where the best anyone (teachers and students) can do is survive. But the fact that Barthes, and teachers like him, won't give up-- and the fact that Mr. Kaye made this movie-- tells us that hope is alive, if not well. The hope rests almost entirely in our lonely, detached teachers.",

            "content": "DETACHMENT is an extraordinary achievement in filmmaking. Written by first time writer Carl Lund and directed by the controversial Tony Kaye (one would never know, but he performs music and comedy at open mics around Los Angeles), and presented by one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable, this film should be required viewing for everyone from junior high to the elderly. In one poignant story we are provided glimpses into the current status of our public education, the plight of burned out teachers attempting to repair the absent parent syndrome while reaching out to find a place beyond drugs, fighting, physical and mental abuse and the lethargy of responding to a chaotic world, and a dark view of the existentialism that allows each of us to forge ahead despite a sense of worth in a world gone crazy.Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody in a galvanizing performance) copes with life as a substitute teacher: he comes into schools for a specific stint then detaches and repeats the cycle of caring to provide hope for kids to become someone of significance, failing repeatedly. He is assigned to a New York school headed by the soon to be fired Principal Carol Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden), meets a classroom of foul mouthed, disrespectful, angry students and attempts to teach them English. He is immediately challenged by a sassy kid whom he sends out of the room, a young angry black student with whom he connects by showing him parameters of interaction, a young obese, disturbed but gentle Meredith (Betty Kay, in a sterling performance) among others. He also encounters the other teachers and staff - the beautiful Sarah Madison (Christina Hendricks), the school counselor Dr. Doris Parker (Lucy Liu), the burned out Mr. Wiatt (Tim Blake Nelson) and Ms Perkins (Blythe Danner) and Mr. Sarge Kepler (William Peterson), and only teacher who fights back with a sense of humor Mr. Charles Seaboldt (James Caan). It is a grim situation and Henry takes his depression home.Henry encounters a young girl Erica (Sami Gayle, in a career making role) who despite her youth is a street hooker, beaten badly by her johns. He offers her protection in his meager home - a place to sleep and eat and recover form the street abuse of her profession. A profound relationship develops - and while that satisfies Erica's desperate need for family, it frightens Henry enough to eventually call foster care to remove her. Henry visits his elderly mentally challenged Grandpa (Louis Zorich) who lives in a assisted living home and his frustrations about his memories of his apparently alcoholic suicidal mother and the lack of care being given his Grandpa results in one of Henry's rare explosions of anger - a rage that extends to every aspect of his view of life. At school Henry gradually wins the hearts and minds of his class, showing them that education is the path to living a life of meaning. His friendship with the beleaguered Meredith is supportive, but as Henry completes his three week assignment at the school tragedies surround him. It seems that everyone in the story is in a life and death struggle to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world.In addition to the actors mentioned there are shining little vignette roles by Celia Au, Ren\u00e9e Felice Smith, Kwoade Cross, and others - many appearing for the first time on film and each radiating talent. But the film belongs to Adrien Brody who provides such a staggeringly real character that his message is felt in every cell of the viewer's mind. This is a first rate film in every aspect. It should be seen by everyone who either shares the mental milieu of the characters depicted here or cares deeply about the sad chaotic situation we have created during these particular times.

            "content": "I hope you do not detach yourself from my movie review of the drama \"Detachment\". But if you do, I punderstand I mean understand due to the numerous puns incorporated. \"Detachment\" stars Adrien Brody as Henry Barthes, a longtime substitute teacher who detaches himself from deep emotion due to a troubled past. Oh Henry! What could have happened? I will detach myself from revealing that because it does play a crucial factor in the film's narrative, and I do not want to spoil it for you. When he is transferred to another school, Henry's life begins to change due to the new people in his life. Henry befriends an attractive teacher colleague named Sarah Madison. A bullied female student named Meredith admires Henry due to his willingness to always help students in need. Henry also aids a young prostitute named Erica, and even allows her to stay in his place, with no sexual attachments required. Henry also constantly visits his ailing elderly grandfather. Henry is a good man. But when Meredith wants Henry to be a substitute of a father figure, and when Erica wants Henry to be a substitute of a lover figure, and when Grampa wants Henry to be a substitute of a savior figure, and when Ms. Madison falsely accuses Henry of being a substitute of a child molester figure, it puts Henry into a maximum stress level state. Director Tony Kaye, who also helmed \"American History X\", does more than an O Kaye job in presenting a story of a melancholy man trying to assist others while at the same time holding on to a dark past. Carl Lund's \"Detachment\" screenplay was a bit unorthodox but well-worded. Brody has not been this good in a starring role since his Oscar-winning turn in \"The Pianist\". Brody taught us a lesson that he can still act with his marvelous work as Henry! Yo Adrien, you did it! Christina Hendricks continues her rise to movie stardom with another well-rounded performance as Sarah Madison. Others in the supporting acting faculty that had passing grades included James Caan as veteran teacher Charles Seaboldt, Marcia Gay Harden as Principal Carol Dearden, Tim Blake Nelson as Mr. Wiatt, and Lucy Liu as Assistant Principal Dr. Doris Parker. Young actresses Sami Gayle who played Erica and Betty Kaye who played Meredith did show some promise with their performances, but still have to pass a few more tests to gain acting tenure. So my assignment for you is to go to your own personal homeroom and examine \"Detachment\". ****Good",

As a matter of fact this is one of those movies, I wished I saw earlier in my life because it is impactful to a certain extent. And gave me a more in depth perspective of today's youth. What this film shows is the altered realities of teenagers in this present time and why they feel so detached. When you are in your teens your still in that learning phase in your life and part of it is the downfall of the environments in certain schools. Which can lead to coldness, super immaturity and being ungrateful for the effort that is given to you by others. I know, because I was actually one of those students. This film shows the heroic aspects of some teachers. Watching this movie now, at a time when I started to realized certain things on this journey called life. Makes movies like these more meaningful. This is a film that is most definitely worth a watch, especially for high school students. Adrien Brody's performance is superb and all the other cast members did a good job, including Lucy Liu. Overall, I thought this film could have done a bit more when it came to the student elements, but it did a good enough job to make a 9/10 in my opinion. Plus the caving in of the teachers was done right, maybe slightly exaggerated but I am no teacher myself. Perhaps if it stayed more true to the writer it just might have been better, but it's pointless to delve upon the what if.9/10",

It will be overlooked (it actually already has been overlooked), but it is a movie that dares to be different. A movie that takes its title literally and goes the whole nine yards with it.But it's not only the Brody show. Everyone involved in this (even the kid actors) are really good. It's funny, touching and dramatic sometimes in mere seconds apart. I don't think the movie will leave you without an impression.

The kids led by Sammi Gayle (who should get more story lines on Blue Bloods) and Betty Kaye with that very small but well written part for Rene Felice Smith brought this story to the top for me. The story was outstanding and really put things about our lives and even our education system in focus.

This film needs to be seen, people need to understand the conditions and circumstances presented in it of urban school environments; the trials that teachers and students face everyday, and the ravages wrought by \"No Child Left Behind\". The role played by Sami Gayle is astonishing, where she found that character is beyond me.

Scathing indictment of the American educational system from agent provocateur filmmaker Tony Kaye features a terrific, low-key modulated performance by Brody (his best since copping the Oscar in THE PIANIST) as a haunted New York high school substitute teacher who finds himself at odds with the indifference, angst and anomie of his young charges and the push-pull relationship with a teen prostitute (amazing newcomer Gayle) he takes in under his wing. Brody's sad-sack demeanor and the most expressive eyes on screen since Bette Davis speaks volumes for his anguished character, Henry Barthes, and a stellar ensemble including Caan as a seen-it-all-world-weary colleague and veteran character actor Zorich as his dementia-addled grandfather. Kudos also to Kaye for using his real-life daughter Betty as Barthes' most loyal student with a burden to bare throughout the film until its heady climax that only falters in an otherwise fine screenplay by Carl Lund.

            "content": "\"I call him religious who understands the suffering of others.\" - Mahatma GandhiTony Kaye's \"Detachment\" stars Adrian Brody as substitute teacher Henry Barthes. The product of an abusive home, Barthes remains at a protective distance from other human beings. Rootless, anhedonic and without material or personal attachments, Barthes spends his days bouncing from school to school. Students don't matter. People don't matter. Barthes' journey toward compassion and so connection begins when he meets Erica (Sami Gayle), a damaged prostitute. He takes Erica into his home, cares for her, their relationship offering respite from a world that is otherwise callous and indifferent. How indifferent? Throughout \"Detachment\", Kaye portrays the high-school, the streets, the family and the workplace as vile arenas. Teachers, principles, businessmen, children, adults, students...everyone on display is a cauldron of apathy, guided only by hate, ignorance, profit and self-gratification. How can such a society produce anything but monsters? How can such a society produce anything but burnt-out bodies, misery and sickness?Kaye's solution, of course, is to try a little tenderness; inject a little love and empathy into the mix. It's a tactic which Barthes himself tries. But after hugging a depressed teenager, Barthes quickly becomes a child abuse suspect. It's a cruel irony. We no longer underestimate the power of a touch, smile, listening ear or kind word, but view such things with suspicion at best, signs of weakness at worst. \"Detachment\" is said to be about the \"problems with America's failing school system\", but it's not really. Kaye has no interest in assigning blame to either teachers, parents or students. All may be simultaneously culpable, but for Kaye, these people and institutions are products of something else; something widespread, global and deeply entrenched. \"The powers that be are dumbing us to death!\" Barthes yells, as he rants about the dangers of what he calls a \"marketing Holocaust\". But no one listens. \"Detachment\" boasts a fine performance by Adrian Brody, whose character represents the moral flip-side to his work in Ken Loach's underrated \"Bread and Roses\". The film has been criticised for being heavy-handed, bombastic and over-the-top, criticisms which are all true. \"Detachment's\" last act, which contains a clich\u00e9d suicide and much forced \"tragedy\", is itself mostly a mess. But some of this can be excused; shot on a low budget and in a just a handful of days, what Kaye achieves given the limitations imposed upon him is admirable. In a world of vacuous spectacle, a humble film with a point is a thing to celebrate. 7.9/10 \u2013 A good film, despite a poor second half. See \"Half Nelson\".",

Adrien Brody gives his best performance since The Pianist and what a supporting cast\u0085James Caan is hilarious, Marcia Gay Harden is amazing, and Lucy Liu (of all people) is so vulnerable\u0085I didn't know she was capable of that. It seems like actors we have come to rely on for solid performances decided to experiment and step outside their comfort zone, under the direction of Tony Kaye (American History X).The film itself is a harsh look at the realities facing inner city schools. Brody plays a substitute journeyman teacher, Henry Barthes, who (a little too Dangerous Minds) connects with his misguided students\u0085 but as opposed to trying to confront his students or make them read poetry (like 5 million other lame movies), he seems to share his own pain and anger with the world in order to connect..It really works. On them, and on us.I don't want to give anything away, but this is a film that confronts both psychological and physical tragedy, where every character seems to be up against their own feeling of helplessness\u0085students, teachers, administration, and a young prostitute who doesn't attend school that Henry decides to help. One especially powerful scene is Parent/Teacher night. Shocking, subtle, and effortless. That's how I would describe this whole movie.Ultimately, Detachment was very thorough at examining the ins and outs of the schools problems through individuals and as a collective. But it also feels like a character piece about this tormented substitute. The movie jumps a little too much (maybe), but I don't really care. Tony Kaye does what he does best here, delivers a gritty, edgy, shocking, and ultimately important film. This is a director that should be making more films.

It raises a lot of questions and social issues without giving many answers, but it does make us aware of many problems that our society is facing when it comes to the educational system and parents lack of involvement in it. I thought Detachment was a beautiful film and despite it being a narrative it didn't seem like one; it is sort of poetic at times and has some great use of imagery. Adrian Brody is such a talented actor, and despite winning the Oscar for his brilliant work in The Pianist, I think he is very underrated in Hollywood. He is so good in this movie, and in my opinion it's his best performance since The Pianist. He was one of the reasons why I wanted to see this film; the other being that it was directed by Tony Kaye, the man responsible for American History X, which is on my list of favorite films. His films are powerful, thought provoking, and Detachment is not the exception. He can make memorable films although you wouldn't necessarily call them entertaining. In Detachment we are introduced to a very common problem: education. Kaye makes us wonder whether or not education is the teacher or parent's responsibility. Probably both, but unfortunately neither seem to be doing a great job and our society is losing its educational battle. Kids seem to find values somewhere else and base their self worth on what their friends think of them, meanwhile parents and teachers seem to do nothing about restoring their value. Parenting and teaching are great responsibilities, and as Brody says in one of his monologues in the movie there should be prerequisites to parenting and not anyone should be allowed too.Adrian Brody plays a substitute teacher, Mr. Barthes, who believes he has the perfect job because he doesn't have to carry the burden of identifying or carrying for his students. He can travel from one school to another. He is a lonely, quiet, and sad man who doesn't like attaching to anyone. He seems to have some disturbing memories about his past and doesn't like to talk about his problems so traveling from place to place is a good way to remain detached to society. His life will change when he gets his latest assignment at a very problematic school run by Principle Carol Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden). The students in this school give the teachers a very hard time and many of them seem to be going through a living hell. Mr. Barthes identifies with some of the teachers and students here. Mr. Seaboldt (James Caan), Ms. Madison (Christina Hendricks), Ms. Perkins (Blythe Danner), Mr. Wiatt (Tim Blake Nelson), and Dr. Doris Parker (Lucy Liu) are all part of the school faculty and all seem to be going through some sort of personal hardship. Mr. Barthes begins to identify himself with some of these people like Ms. Madison who seems as lonely as he is. He also begins to give special attention to one of his students named Meredith (Betty Kaye) who despite being talented doesn't really value herself. Another person who begins to influence Mr. Barthes is a young hooker named Erica (Sami Gayle) who he picks up from the street and begins to care for as a child. As much as Barthes wants to remain detached to people he begins to identify with many of them and without realizing it attaching to them.Detachment has a great cast. As I mentioned before this is Adrian Brody's best work since The Pianist, but I also have to give a lot of credit to young Sami Gayle who delivers a powerful performance as the lonely hooker who is taken advantage of and really has no self worth whatsoever. Director Kaye seems to raise this issue quite a bit since there are many characters who have little or no self value and in a way Brody's character tries to teach them that they have value and don't have to live based on the expectations or values given to them by others. James Caan and Christina Hendricks also give believable performances as part of the faculty. They are very different in character, but I think we all can identify them to some of the teachers we've had in the past. There are some very strong performances in this film and also some great dialogues. The script was written by first time screenwriter, Carl Lund, and it really is thought provoking. The imagery that Kaye uses is also very beautiful. There is a sense of claustrophobia as we see these long shots closing in on the school hallway, and emptiness when we see the abandoned classrooms. Detachment might not be an entertaining film you can watch with your friends, but it is a very interesting and thought provoking film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",

Teachers, students and parents deserve better, but that would require all citizens doing better, a task which I'm afraid may just be too great.\"No Child Left Behind\" is a joke. The good teachers need better pay, more latitude, respect and support. The teachers with attitudes, burn-out, or just horrid teachers, need to be saved from themselves and put on the road to a better life. Creativity, imagination, individual strengths should be encouraged. Let our teachers teach instead of spouting the rhetoric they're forced to do, so their pupils can score high on state assessments. Teach our children well for everyone's future, not just so you can hang another ribbon on your chest or plaque on the school wall. Enough of my diatribe, watch it yourself.",

Mr Barthes (Brody) is a brilliant and inspiring teacher and a moral man, but struggling. There are powerful performances by a glittering ensemble cast; with honourable mention going to Lucy Liu, James Caan and the newly introduced Sami Gayle as young prostitute Erica. Also well acted was Betty Kaye as troubled Meredith, student in Mr Bathes class.This is a stylised documentary-esque film... Brody is interviewed \"in character\" throughout the film and the film is illustrated by chalk on blackboard diagrams and the artwork of Meredith. It doesn't flow as a story/film given the artiness of it, but that adds to the drama and tension of the film and you are left feeling rather frayed at the end. Nothing in the film is \"nice\" and an easy-watch and you are constantly worried what the next revelation will be, but in it is still a gripping and inspirational piece of cinema; the importance of good parenting and the skill and importance of good teachers are highlights. Brody's Mr Bathes is such an inspirational teacher... and you wish there are more like him.",

He is perfectly cast for this part. Generally there is nothing to complain about regarding any of the acting in the movie. Very well done.Dialogue: Good dialogue is important. Especially for a movie like this which is entirely character driven. Adrian gives some nice moving speeches and James Caan has some quite witty humorous lines. Overall, the dialogue is good.Vision: The creators of the movie were trying to create a movie that showed the reality of hopelessness in struggling urban school environments. I understand the 'detachment' they are trying to convey and applaud them for trying not to dress it up to much with a Hollywood tale. However, there are some problems with the execution of the vision which leads me to...The bad:Script: If a strong script is important to you: avoid this movie. The story relies on sucking you in to the emotional performances of the characters to create its meaning.Poor directing/Tries to hard: Unfortunately, many of the scenes are a little over the top. In its attempt to make us feel we witness scene after scene of extreme behavior. The chance to connect with the subtle emotions of real life drama are lost and we are caught up in a melodrama. The movie tries hard to make you \"FEEL\" something. Its a little like a sales pitch for sadness. I found myself getting annoyed at certain moments like I was in a live showing of Dave Letterman and the audience 'laugh' sign pops up to tell you what to do only here its this is your cue to \"feel this _____ emotion\".Overall, I found myself feeling like Rick Groen of the globe summed this movie up the best saying: \"Ultimately, Detachment invites us to feel precisely what it warns against, detached.\" I enjoy curling up with a tub of ice cream and feeling depressed about life as much as the next person. However, I need my movies to be the whole package if they are going to take me there. Here about halfway through I found myself wanting to skip ahead some scenes because they were boring me. Indeed I felt a little detached.Want to watch something that deals with similar subject matter yet doesn't overdress it?

Who thinks they're bold, too smart for their own good or too bad to be cared. Detachment is a chronicle of three weeks in the lives of several high school teachers, administrators and students through the eyes of a substitute teacher named Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody). Barthes' method of imparting vital knowledge to his temporary students is interrupted by the arrival of three women in his life. His life gets more complicated when he takes in a teenage prostitute called Erica (Sami Gayle). I loved everything about Detachment, from script, to writing, direction, performances and most importantly the whole presentation. It's more like a documentary than a movie, which favored the movie considering its genre. Adrian Brody does a fantastic job as an actor and it won't be wrong to say that since the Pianist, that's her best performance till date. The performances by the supporting cast Sami Gayle, Aaron Sauter, James Caan, Christina Hendricks, Lucy Liu, Marcia Gay Harden, Bryan Cranston, William Petersen, Blythe Danner, Tim Blake Nelson and Betty Kaye is realistic and simply superb. I'll highly recommend this movie to everyone as it shows what new generation is turning into, though it doesn't give you the reason for social downfall but it defiantly opens your eyes.",

The movie involves you in it from second 1, though there is not much of a story as one would expect, but again this movie is about reality at its finest.The characters were strong and though the movie was a bit slow, it made its point and point well made I would say.

            "review_title": "Powerful, yet overwrought",
            "content": "To sum up what Depressi- I mean Detachment is like, just realize this is a grand social critique by the man who directed American History X. This leads me to only one way to describe Detachment: its heart is in the right place and it has some compelling drama going for it, but it's too over the top to present its social critique in a completely convincing manner. In a way, the same problems that plagued American History X now plague this film.Our main character is a substitute teacher named Henry Barthes, played by Adrien Brody whose face has a melancholy quality that makes him a natural fit for this film. In addition to merely teaching what the school wants him to teach, he actively tries to engage the students on an emotional and ethical level, to teach them things about life and so on. He goes on about the corrupting influence of the media and how the students must learn to think for themselves, etc. You'd think that would be enough to fill one film, but we also get a prostitute Henry pick up off the streets and tries to take care. There's also Henry's dying grandfather who lives in a nursing home and various employees at the school with problems of their own. The film thus tries to paint an enormous critique of the high school system through various characters.What the film has going for it, are the same things American History X had going for it: great acting and drama. Adrien Brody and the rest of the cast are all quite great, particularly Brody. The film is at its preachy best during the classroom scenes where Henry outlines several societal critiques in his bid to truly educate his students in his short time there. Several other scenes, including one where Henry verbally lashes one of the nursing home's employees for not taking care of his grandfather's needs, also have a great sense of drama and whether or not you'll like/love/hate the film, there is no doubt that watching Detachment is an impactful, intense experience.The thing that really hurts this film, however, is the same thing that hurt American History X: over the top melodrama (complete with slow-motion). As the film goes on, the film becomes increasingly melodramatic to the point that it becomes detrimental to the messages the film intends to spread. When an important, tragic character dies at the end, it feels too much as if the film \u2013 like American History X \u2013 suffers from It's Not A Good Story, Unless Someone Dies syndrome and that's not what you want. You want the death to feel deserved, which I feel this film did not. Also detrimental are the amount of well-known actors in this film. This is one of those cases where the amount of stars don't mix with the type of film. An art-house film featuring a star-studded cast hurts its aims for 'realism'.In the end it's easy to see this film has its heart in the right place. One can sense the anger behind all the social critique delivered in its scenes. Yet it is director Tony Kaye's overwrought sense of drama that makes the film devolve into an ever increasing spiral of sadness and darkness which makes it hard to deliver the Big Message without alienating the audience. Too much melodrama can turn off an audience and that's what happened for me. The film started off incredibly well, featuring lots of well-delivered social critique, but by the end \u2013 especially when (spoiler) the overweight girl died \u2013 the film became too dark and clich\u00e9-ridden. There was no light at the end of the tunnel, no subplots that ended well. Now, this is of course in line with the aims of the film, but how can I stay open to its messages when all it gives me is a nonstop portrayal of a society trapped in a downward spiral, regardless of the truths the film contains?",

            "content": "The most notable feature of this film is its flawed attempt to look at dealing with life by being aware of self. And it is flawed only because the self is flawed. The stylish art of director Tony Kaye is a simple but effective way to put into pictures what is a battle between a flawed but almost true to himself teacher Henry Barthes (Brody) and the contacts he must make each and every day all designed to test, challenge and dismantle his comfort zone. In one sense Barthes doesn't seek connection but he gets it just the same because every less flawed self is attracted by another more flawed self in the act of levelling.Barthes challenge is in the classroom, in an unlikely friendship with Erica (beautifully played by Sami Gayle), in a possible romance, in his father's hospital room, and in the edges around all of this. Because of the way the film is edited the feeling of chaos is sometimes very edgy, almost as if we have been watching out of sequence. But the result is amazingly satisfying as we go through the pain of almost every character as if it were our own pain. And if we take a moment to reflect it is our own pain.The sound track is understated and yet lingers. The cinematography is stylish throughout. The script is provocative and insightful and we are left with a feeling that no matter how permanent a situation may appear it is always temporary although there is always something that lingers.A film against which all others should be judged because it attempts to tell a truth.",

To see Brody, an immensely talented man with an impeccably raw screen presence thanks to his pain-stricken facial expressions and \"common-man with baggage\" appearance, embody a role like he does in Tony Kaye's Detachment is nothing short of a sly miracle and a disappointing feat that it did not manage to drum up any attention or publicity upon its release.Brody plays Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher for a miserable, underfunded public school in New York City. The students are unambitious and compiled up mainly of delinquents, but were they nurtured in that direction or is it just nature and the fact that their roots sprouted in an underprivileged area? Mr. Barthes is hired to substitute for one month, teaching a high school English class. The experience begins on a sour note, with the students immediately holding a disdain for the man and being disruptive, cursing and harassing each other moments after meeting him. Not being taken seriously has to be one of the worst possible blows to a person regardless of any job title, but Mr. Barthes seems about as coldly unmoved by his students as they are to him. He doesn't throw them out of class, unless they bad-mouth each other, but just believes in remaining firm and asserting his position. After all, he can walk out after a month's work and never look back.His attitude is an efficient one, because he keeps many of his students in line. One wonders how the other unfortunate teachers in the building cope with their class. Mr. Barthes becomes increasingly acquainted with multiple females throughout his duties at this high school, one of the girls being an unfortunate, overweight soul named Meredith (Betty Kaye), the other a prostitute he meets one day on the bus named Erica (Sami Gayle).Throughout the film, we constantly see how detached from society Mr. Barthes is, and we question if it's inherent detachment of it he is trying to become attached but simply can't. Rather than providing answers to these problems, director Tony Kaye (of American History X fame) seems to be more intrigued in the way that these teachers cope with their impending personal lives and in their mentally destructive work lives.But one of Detachment's greatest success points, on me, personally, was the fact that it made me sympathize with teachers and give them a bit more credit than I usually do. The film showcases how the students they teach are clearly uninterested in their peers or their schoolwork in general, how persistent budget cuts from wealthy, ignorant politicians and their obsession with standardized test scores has lead them down a path of an almost incurable status, the fact that these teachers are almost as depressed and as hopeless as the students they teach, and their persistent self-esteem degradation by parents who feel they're not properly conducting their job. I should really climb out of my surburbia public school shell more often.Starring: Adrien Brody, Marcia Gay Harden, Christina Hendricks, William Petersen, Bryan Cranston, Tim Blake Nelson, Betty Kaye, Sami Gayle, Lucy Liu, Blythe Danner, and James Caan.

            "content": "Substitute teacher Henry (Adrien Brody) likes his job just fine. Emotionally scarred from a difficult childhood and still dealing with a sick, nursing home-dwelling grandfather, Hank wants as few attachments as possible. Hence, we know the meaning of the film's title. As a sub, he can't truly get to make long term connections with the students or faculty. Yet, he is quietly very good at his profession, gaining respect from his pupils and the district's personnel offices. Things can change. Henry decides to accept a sub position that will last a month, a detour from his routine. Sure enough, Henry wins the attention and admiration of most of his students, especially Meredith (Betty Kaye), who has a troubled home life despite being a promising art pupil. Also, there is an attractive fellow teacher (Christina Henricks) who shows an interest in the new guy. Finally, Henry encounters a teenage hooker-runaway on the subway, Erica (Sami Gayle) and decides to heal her surface wounds and keep her off the streets, at least temporarily. Now, Hank has a bunk mate, which develops into a tentative father-daughter relationship. Unhappily, Henry still suffers from destructive mental flashbacks and his sick dad. Will he truly let himself get out of his preferred state of detachment? This is a sad but powerful film about opening our hearts to good relationships in life and letting go of those that hurt us. Its tricky, yes. As the teacher who wants to shut down his emotions to avoid pain, Brody is excellent. Also fine are the great supporting players, Lucy Liu, Marcia Gay Harden, James Caan, Blythe Danner, Hendricks, Kaye, and Gayle. Gayle, especially, is terrific as the troubled runaway while Kaye, the director's daughter, is quietly heartbreaking, too. The setting on Long Island is bleak enough for the subject matter while the script, which could be called too heavy, makes its points nonetheless. Add on the excellent direction and you find a movie that is hard to forget. No, don't see it if you are having a miserable day yourself but make time for it when you can better handle a sad but richly rewarding tale of teens and the people that instruct them in life.",

There's a light at the end of all the tunnel, keep going and your light will shine. I've lost friends to suicide and heroin and wish both of these amazing people shared that optimism.The cast is fantastic and brilliantly acted. (Why wasn't Brody nominated for an Oscar?)

I think the narrator, the necessity for him, let alone the very presence of him, is a weakness in the movie, but in the skeem of a really fine film like this, it's a minor mistake. The viewer, then, by the narrator's narration, understands that some water has flowed under the bridge since the last scene in the actual story. Tho many write that this movie is \"about a substitute teacher\", one who has trouble staying put wherever, I don't think it's about that. It's about community, community as it manifests, permeates, and undermines or supports a school in it's midst. It's about fighting indifference, violence, chaos--entropy--by the simple act of caring.",

Because it certainly doesn't luck truth, something that many movie directors don't really think that much about but Tony Kaye and Carl Lund put emphasis on.I really appreciated his performance in The Pianist, but with this movie Adrien Brody has proved himself worthy of being one of my favorite actors. The frequent close-ups and extreme close-ups also helped much in establishing connection with his character, Henry, and I can't say I wasn't satisfied with the rest of the cast, though I reckon I'd have wanted a better closure for some of the characters who just walked out of the door in the last part of the movie. Perhaps their sudden ''detachment'' from the narrative was a justified parallel to the main character's struggle but still, it could have been done a tad better.\nOtherwise, no complaint.A 9 out 10 from me.",

I didn't know anything about this person other than her role on Blue Blood and that show limits her acting strength after seeing Detachment. Here was a film that Tony Kaye directed with an understatement that disguises the powerful argument for sterilization. The students have dissolved into disrespectful future parole violators and the parents, some of them, are the source of these problem children. And trying to ride that ship in turbulent waters in the Adrian Brody character. His attempts to settle those waters is a force of nature one man cannot do alone. But I don't know if he calms those waters following a tragedy or if all hell hits the place and that was a dream? I don't know how old Sami Gayle was when this role was filmed but her corrupt innocence is washed over as an abused prostitute. Her first time encounter with the Adrian Brody character isn't Pretty Woman, a film I hated for it's depiction of the happily ever after prostitute. Sami Gayle's prostitute had more realism to it. The only misgivings I had was that the audience never got to know the results from her medical test. Perhaps it was edited out for time. And the teachers were excellent. I saw where Adrian Brody was the producer for this project. He pulled some top notched actors that made this work. James Caan , Lucy Lui, Marsha Gay Harden, Christine Hendricks, the other guy who held on to the chain link fence, all were good. And while watching this, you had the feeling that some student might go off on the deep end and that was predictable and not unexpected but it was done with the right tempo and uniqueness, no gun play.And I saw where it didn't do well at the box office. Well, with video on demand, I hope this avenue will work out for them so that more eyes can watch this exceptionally independent film.",

            "content": "Tony Kaye, the elusive director of the hard-hitting 'American History X', directs a glittering all-star cast in this existential tour de force. 'Detachment' may have been released a few months short of Oscar season, and given a limited run, but nominations for best director, best lead actor (Adrien Brody) and best original screenplay (first-timer Carl Lund) are the very least this five-star film deserves. Adrien Brody, a great actor despite many dubious roles, delivers his finest performance since 2002's 'The Pianist'. Here he plays Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher whose back-story is more tumultuous than those of the inner-city kids he teaches. Their problems are self-evident. They come from broken homes, are largely ethnic, indigent and have few opportunities to escape their genetic misfortune. Henry's neglect began as young boy when his father left home, causing his mother to fatally overdose, leaving him to care for his Alzheimer's-stricken grandfather. Kaye brilliantly manages to develop a long list of peripheral characters whilst never removing the focus from Henry. Marcia Gay Harden's principal knows she heads a failed school, but forlornly clings on despite her impending extinction. Lucy Liu, the school shrink, reveals in a violent outburst that she is more vulnerable than the kids. James Caan (outstanding in his supporting role) consoles her, as he plays the only teacher who seems to be able to cope, though only with the aid of happy pills. He relates to the students by coming down to their level, which is a very low level indeed. Christina Hendricks, Tim Blake Nelson and William Peterson fill in as other teachers; the sort who would have said they came into this hellhole to 'make a difference'. The story pays homage to 'Taxi Driver' when Henry befriends underage prostitute, Erica (Sami Gayle in her film debut). At first he has no intention of sheltering her, and is content to allow her to continue prostituting herself. But just as Iris was De Niro's saviour in the other film, Erica unwittingly becomes Henry's saviour. Drawing inspiration from existentialist novelist Albert Camus, the other key character in this story is Meredith (Tony Kaye's daughter, Betty). She plays Henry's only capable student, but has serious self-confidence issues because she is overweight and \u2013 the film's recurring theme \u2013 has wretched parents. Henry reassures her with his philosophical insights, but her confidence is crushed when he refuses to embrace her, causing a tragic and irreversible conclusion. I appreciate this film because it courageously illuminates a dark side of life. It drew me in and blew me away. It has so much heart and emotional integrity that I sat in the back row, quietly sobbing my eyes out as I remembered related events in my own life. www.moseleyb13.com",

But it's much more then that, which is what I like the most about the film. It's an entire metaphor about life, it's ups and downs, how it effects everyone differently and how each individual person copes. It's symbolic in how it expresses that there is hope for those who struggle long enough to find it, if you've yet to lose yourself. If your deep into indie dramas, I say this is a good pick.

First of all the cast list looked like it was going to great, Adrien Brody, Bryan Cranston (who was in it for all of 2 minutes if that whose appearance had no relevance to the story whatsoever) Lucy Liu yeah she was in it but for what purpose? No idea. SO this teacher is a substitute who is 'detached from emotion' due to his mums suicide when he was little and we are left wondering if granddad abused her, with no real background just snippets of dodgy camera work in whacked out colours. He takes pity on an underage prostitute and takes her under his wing. One of the pupils who he is teaching likes him, says she wants to talk asks him if he likes her, he consoles her by giving her a cold hearted cuddle and then gets practically accused of touching her, leaving her to commit suicide and he tries to save her. No idea about the relationship with the prostitute as he didn't get it on with her-and think they may have been just friends. Suspected paedo Grandpa died in a nursing home that weren't looking after him. In a nutshell thats about it. Adrien Brody was emotionally detached hence the name of the film.

One would expect an unkempt facility would be another sign of the inward struggles going on in everyone's life. That is usually the outcome of schools in failure. is it not? The House of Usher was the exact metaphor for that school, the outward sign of inward decay. But what would have been able to fix it? A handful of teachers? In my opinion, the absence of God throughout the characters' lines, and the lack of respect for Him, which is the present preoccupation and intent of today's administrations, led this particular school to decline.Education and knowledge will never be enough when it is not mixed with virtue, and what this movie shows is the price of such an environment, which, I think, speaks for most of American educational institutions. There are no absolutes being taught. Everything is up for grabs. Kids are being told to decide life as they see it. Anything you want to believe is okay. But, if we don't teach our kids to accept the most stable spiritual foundation, the Judeo-Christian belief system, we'll continue to get what is represented in this film, a mass of people wondering just what is worth believing, what stabilizes.

            "content": "I'm glad I watched it despite the fact different people said it was too depressing. It's an excellent film about education, about the high school system and the educators' helplessness. Adrien Brody is Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher, who, for profound sadness rooted in his childhood, doesn't want to remain too long or too deep with anyone or anything. Marcia Gay Harden is the school bitter principal Carol Dearden who doesn't understand how much she cares until it's taken away from her. Each of the teachers, except one -James Caan as Mr. Charles Seaboldt, is solitary, suffering, on the verge of insanity.And then there are the pupils, rude, violent, with no boundaries. They too are sad, sad, sad, we realize, and if they are not sad, their life is hard or they have no future.Despite all this,Brody as Barthes has beautiful moments of compassion, and he forms bonds with one student and one minor working as a whore. He also has very ambivalent relationships with his hospitalized grandfather. All these bonds lead somewhere, not necessarily good or bad, but humane, and this makes the whole movie worthwhile.Comparing with The Class (2008) it has a much more solid narrative, and unlike The Class it does not try to appear as a documentary. I think that in The Class did not take a POV of a teacher and his limited perspective, so you got to see more of the pupils' lives. It stated specific social problems more than treated the general state of affairs. As a film, Detachment is more solid with better acting, pacing and story. As a social warning, perhaps The Class is stronger.",

In whole, we see the efforts of a substitute teacher to try to manipulate the manners of unethical kids . I don't know if the situation that is shown in this movie responds to the reality but if it does then it goes without saying ''God bless America''. Because this lifestyle is starting to adopted in my country, Greece . Kids must not only assault the teacher but also offend him. Mr Barthes is very decisive and knows how to react in these situations. Adrion Brody acts like he was being a teacher for several years.As it mentioned before , we see the efforts of Mr Barthes trying to help and at the same time teach his classroom. So he helps a raped slut that is very young and takes him to his house in order to take her after. Mr Barthes is firstly an altruist and not a conservative teacher who doesn't care about his class. Furthermore he helps Meredith who is a victim of offensive language from their students because of her beauty.Suddenly we see the difficult job of a teacher. These two, Meredith and the whore are sticking in Mr Barthes life without worrying about the future but only for the present. ''What should I do later?'', ''Is Mr Barthes keep me in her house forever?'' , ''I believe that Mr Barthes loves me''. These are the thoughts of frustrated personalities that they don't have anyone in their life to encourage them . All they need is some moral support and someone just to listen them.Nowdays everyone is very stressed and they don't spend time with their children. For many they don't even care about their future . They are just ''mouths to need to be fed''. I see the prejudices and the doublethink'' To be nice I must be thin''.'' To attract girls I must be working out'' ( I don't know that girls thinking sorry ) . Is this what is called sense of life? Of course not. The sense of life is determined by the choices you do. If you do the right choices you will be happy , if not you will be sad. And that is expressing clearly on the dialogue of Dr Doris Parker with one student whose dream is to play in a band after graduating and doesn't even care about school .The resolution to this is that teachers and only teacher considering that the most parents don't really care must lead students ''seize the day''. The fact that they are school is itself remarkable considering that in another countries they don't have teachers . An uneducated person ,these days , is a thing that is being used from everyone . And the worst is that he cant really react to the mistreatment who is living because when he had the chance to learn things he reacted to his teachers when the teachers , the good teachers, are the only one that they care about the future of the new generations.",

            "content": "It's directed by Tony Kaye who has done one of my favorites, American History X. Let me just be clear right now, I f@cking loved this film, it had been a while that I watched a legit film like this; films like these are relief and remedy to my soul. Talking about the story, my god, it's a pure emotional, tragic, and essential story, you get bonded with the main character so well, all his struggles and pain, his feelings and sadness, his responsibility towards these young careless students. It's a simple story, a sub teacher who feels responsible about his student and their future but at the same time dealing with his own difficulties. So indeed it's a sad drama story, but it delivers a heavy message with a lot of emotion to it, and that's I love it Performances are very fine; Adrien Brody delivers and doesn't disappoint in any scenes. Supporting roles are cast well, especially Sami Gayle, I hope she gets more recognized, she's definitely talented and has a long road ahead of her, which can be bright and successful. Even though, I get a feeling some might say her character was useless, I would totally disagree, because it shows Adrien Brody's character cares about teenagers, not just as his profession.One element that levels up the emotion in the film is the soundtrack. My god, The Newton Brothers doesn't disappoint for a second; their work seriously needs to get more recognized here. If a day comes with me becoming a filmmaker, I'd love to work with them for a project.The cinematography and editing are fine, for some the cinematography might get annoying due to some cam shakes, but honestly you can let it go and not be serious with, it made the tone more authentic in my opinion.Finally, I highly recommend this film to everyone. Even if you don't like drama movies please, still own it and show it to your kids or grandchildren at some point, this is a must see for any students, or even parents - I'm sure you won't be losing your eyes by watching a legit drama movie that has a proper message and lesson. My rating is 9/10.",

The film is based on modern ironic society where young students are the victims of dystopian world to fulfill the goals that is not easy. Achieving everything is nothing, the truth!It's easy to get spoiled and earn money in a wrong way, but hard to face the truth. In this film there is a lesson that we must try to learn. Bright young souls are getting dark without guidance, motivation, and care. Students are getting frustrated about the outburst society, parents blaming on teachers, teachers blaming on the students, politics is behind! Corruption, power, domination, enchanted like two-faced god! Love is getting very physical. Relationship has no emotion, no feelings. Daily life is getting filled-up with bad slang. Teachers are helpless to educate. Parents are neglecting their own children. This is the present social scenario of advanced educated countries and the future of developing countries.We are ironically educated to hide the truth. We have eyes to see the right, but we act the blind. Shame on whom? Shame is detaching us from us! This is a film that tries to put some light and may be given an example of hope.With love Vikram",

Those who watch will understand and sympathize with the wide range of characters that the movie portrays, based on their own experiences and age. Teenagers dealing with the angst of growing up in a world that they cannot possibly control, can sympathize with the majority of the students of this school, displayed in varying and unique circumstances. Further we come across the point of view of those that are older and are searching for deeper meaning in what life has to offer them, or anybody, which exemplifies the generation of those out of schooling and not yet old enough for achieved wisdom. Furthermore down the line of age and maturity comes the darker beliefs of the elder generation. Stuck in time, when they really appreciated what they did and what they stood for (the golden age) and now seeing what and where they are today. It gives them a dismal view of our future, a future where society will implode if our youth continues on the trend that has been set. But in the end. The final message of this emotional story is that of a positive idea breaking out of a negative mentality. That maybe there is hope. Even if it lies in a singular story you've helped alter in a positive direction, despite your mistrials and failures.",

I have read what the director wanted from the movie and Tony Kaye did a wonderful job. He picked a wonderful cast and I don't disagree with his decision to cast his own daughter because she played the role beautifully and convincingly and I also believe it would be hard on any parent to cast their own child into a role like that, but she absolutely completed the movie alongside everyone else.

Oral sex on the bus, spitting on, and threatening a teacher without repercussions. It all lacked reality. The random animations, direct to camera speaking, and shaky camcorder feel didn't help. Watch Season 4 of the Wire if you want to see powerful, yet accurate, character portrayal and dialogue associated with this topic.This just seemed forced, in-your-face, and came across as trite.

If you are looking for open-ended existential questions, you will find a few of those. If you are looking for Adrian Brody to do his sad eyebrow face, you will not be disappointed. There are a few cameos by other great actors, if you are in to that sort of thing.Now, the negative. This film does not offer any valuable insight into any of the problems that it addresses. It gives a sensationalist portrayal of the difficulty of being a teacher in a failing school, the apathy of students and teachers, and the aftermath of childhood abuse. It emphasizes each of these problems without offering any kind of understanding beyond the expression of listless angst. All the vague statements that Adrian Brody says into the camera are certainly less than the sum of their parts.I don't expect all films to offer insight. When the subject matter are issues that people care deeply about, it is nice, but if a film doesn't offer insight at least it can offer entertainment. Well, not this one. The story is aimless and meandering. The child actors are not believable. Instead of watching this movie you might consider just sitting in a corner to think about how bad life can be, and then blame it all on parents without really trying to understand the situation.

I can understand why Adrian Brody won an Oscar for best actor some years ago because he was really great in this and there's just something so moving about the way he can express emotions through his eyes.

I say with no restraint that this is the starkest picture of our underfunded, largely forgotten, malnourished school system I've ever seen.

If he wins an Oscar for The Pianist, what higher prize would you give him for his performance for Detachment? There is no single instant of time during the movie that you feel he is acting. He loses himself entirely in his character. The opening lines are from Albert Camus' The Stranger: \"And never have I felt so deeply at one and the same time so detached from myself and so present in the world\". I cannot think of any better expression to portray this marvellous movie of Tony Kaye. It is not just about high schools, students and teachers, it is about unbearable vulnerability of being human at any age, facing our problems, not knowing how to handle them, holding our guards high, building walls around us to try to protect ourselves and finally surrendering hopelessly or hopefully. You will see those different choices people are making. This movie perfectly answers the question in Ray LaMontagne's soulful soundtrack song Empty: \"Will I always feel this way? So empty, so estranged?\" Watch it to get your answer... Life is so chaotic, not always in a bad way. It may bring happiness too, unexpectedly. This movie is one of those good things in life.",

Every time you think you've reached the bottom, things get even worse. Neither is it an easy movie. Watching it requires a real effort. There is no relief, it's one depressing scene after another. The movie is about teacher Henry Barthes, who passively endures all the calamities that come his way. Not only does he have a very tough job, teaching indifferent and violent children in a school where all hope of improvement has been given up long ago, he also has to cope with his demented grandfather, and with a teenage prostitute he has encountered on the street and tries to help. The themes make this film a tough watching experience, but the form is equally difficult. The story is intertwined with flashes that seem to represent Henry's memories, with parts of a monologue in which Henry shares his despair with the viewer, and with animated blackboard drawings illustrating the other scenes. There are also parts with very nervous editing, and long shots of the school interior. Besides, the viewer has a hard time identifying with Henry. He doesn't seem to have any motives, any feelings or any ambition. 'It's all f****d up', he tells the audience. 'You try to make a difference, but you know you can't'. Henry is a very good teacher, but he doesn't seem to enjoy his work. Neither does he enjoy the inviting kiss from his pretty but lonely colleague, nor the gratitude from the teenager who gets back her dignity because of his care. Detachment can be seen on different levels. On one level, it's about the failure of the American educational system. On another, it's about an individual teacher and his frustrations. And on a third level, it's about the despair of humanity, of knowing that nothing ever will change because human beings are incapable of doing what they should do. A very depressing thought, but Detachment rubs it in very firmly.",

Furthermore, James Caan, Tim Blake Nelson, Lucy Liu and of course Marcia Gay-Harden all deliver greatly.Plot-wise, this isn't your every now and then \"American Beauty-influenced\" drama.

The way Brody portraits this \"broken\", \"barely holding on\", \"yet strong\" character is beyond my comprehension. Once again he proves to be an amazing actor, that makes you feel things as you watch him. The way they gave the character a profound depth is what makes this movie so great. You can have a great actor and a lousy script, but in my humble opinion this movie has it all. Although I found some of the sidetracks to be a bit \"too much\" it all contributed to the \"nakedness\" of the movie. And the \"supporting\" cast is well picked. William Petersen has, although it being a real small roll, the facial expressions needed to believe him. Lucy Liu does it so gracefully and Marcia Gray Harden seals the deal with an amazing performance.This subject must not be kept in the shadows. These kinds of movies should be out there and they should be making people \"feel\". In short I loved the movie, it gave me a sense of sadness but also hope....that there might still be people out there willing to fight for what they believe in. Respect those who are willing to invest in you and your future!",

            "content": "I recently saw this and like many others I had to wonder if inner city schools have become this dark and gloomy. I'm sure that a lot of the parental apathy and sometimes over all anger that occurs when the school is forced to deal with a student who has been disruptive is probably real. I just have a hard time believing that any school could deteriorate as bad as this unless of course the parents have basically thrown in the towel too as the movie suggests.Every so often the movie industry seems to come out with a movie like this that basically shows the deterioration of the inner city school system. Blackboard Jungle was one of the earliest I can remember and the message about the problems of the inner city schools and how that effects the students wasn't much different than this movie over all. Since then there's been many other films basically pointing out the same thing....\"Poor kids from inner city school systems have little chance of getting an education because it's a jungle out there....An by the way....If you're looking for help for the inner city schools...Write Santa...It'll get you about as far\" By now we get it. The situation is dire and getting worse. We no longer need educated factory workers so the powers that be have all but shut down inner city schools because they think it's a wasted effort. To me...That's where the story really needs to go. Stories like this is only the end result of what's being done to the inner city by the movers and shakers. We know the results, what is needed is a movie showing the cause. Otherwise we'll just have more future movies showing kids in America living like they're in third world countries with basically no place to go to school anymore.The movie is well acted with really good performers. I must say that as a fan of the show \"Blue Bloods\" I was really surprised to see the young actress who plays a very straight laced mature teen in that play a teen street hooker in this one. After only seeing her in that other character it was really strange to see her get street smart tough in this when we first see her. What was pretty cool though was the relationship between her and the teacher (Not a sexual nature) was a metaphor for what could be in regards to the school situation. At first it just looked like one bit of happiness in an otherwise gloomy movie, but then I realized it pretty much summed up what was happening on not happening between the teachers, students, and parents that brought the situation to where it was now......I would have given the movie a ten, but I have a hard time giving such a high score to a movie that leaves me a bit depressed by the time it's over.",

If there are movies that add to the discussion, Detachment isn't one of them.Rather than try to present solutions, it just shows the problems. You would think Adrien Brody's character represents the solution but his character is too implausible to be true: idealistic and overly goody-two-shoesy. Plus, is he really the solution?

            "content": "Having notable celebrities, an \"emotional\" storyline with a obvious, clich\u00e9 message, tragic characters and cheap sappy music playing in the background and other bait that of which the Oscars or any award show would consume is the case of The Detachment, a 2011 indie film which won several awards. We often see this type of deprived, artistic and emotional piece about a substitute teacher trying to help illiterate or with poor grades, poor or terrible school filled with stereotypes and bullies that at first, terrorized and bully the school and having one teacher turn it around in the end, well the director seems to get a great idea to make another annoying high school drama film or more specifically a teen- angst film. Tony Kaye who is known for American History X tries to convey his elements of his previous films and try to make the most melodramatic and artistic movie that seems to be derived from other movies related to this.I am not sure what the director is thinking, the fact that we see thousands of films like these and people tend to get suckered into the bad melodrama and the obvious plot lines with poorly drawn characters with terrific actors performing them. I mean how did they get people like Adrian Brody, Christina Hendricks, Bryan Cranston, James Caan to even Lucy Liu \u2014 seriously, she went out of her way to get this terrible role? I felt like this was just a money deal for them and they were just told what to do. I don't want to begin what the film is about, I seriously doubt the plot would even care less as well; it's about a clinically-depressed substitute teacher who's been moved to the most illiterate and bad school that of which is being sold off (or trying to) by Mr. Mattias (Isiah Whitlock Jr.). Adrian Brody plays the substitute teacher, Henry Barthes who is this clinically depressed lemon (as one of the students called him) who isn't like the other teachers although the fact that the other teachers don't fend off the bullies are just as much as him. Anyways, after his father had passed away, he lives a fellow irritating, homeless female student, Erica (Sami Gayle) and has to teach a class full of stereotypes and bullies who try to imitate and scare off the teacher. The film is mainly about this substitute teacher drifting off from classroom to classroom attempting to connect with his fellow students while dealing his own personal demons as well. Oh there is also a overweight artsy student that loves photography, taking pictures of Mr. Wiatt (Tim Blake Nelson) who has gone insane probably because of all the bullying. The film consists of so much stereotypes and bullies that I am baffled why people actually like this movie. I mean, the first few minutes when the Brody character comes to class, there is a stereotypical black person with an attitude problem that threatens him and in the next scene, we also see other teacher, Ms. Sarah Madison played by Hendricks being spit on and threaten to get \"gang-bang\" by a black girl. It's really baffling that people think this film is \"powerful and gripping\" even though the writers of this film clearly play the \"racism card\" of having all to most black people in the school that have either an attitude problem or presumably be in some gang threatening teachers. It's like every teacher in the school are wimps that don't stand against them, even other movies that related to this plot have gangs in the school and there are less emotional people in those movies. I cannot stress how irritating this movie is, everyone in this movie is either an annoying, irritating human being or some pathetic, emotional person that does not have an inch of hope on improving their students. I like the fact that the director try to convey Brody's character feelings through him looking straight at the camera and the cheaply done artistic chalkboard drawings that attempts to convey some emotional impact. It felt like the director just wanted to have this movie be drenched with awards and have a melodramatic message and theme, terribly implemented to make it dramatic to the audience. In the end, people who think this movie is even good is either have bad taste in movies or some sucker who get cheaply suckered into the melodrama and say things like \"the movie has a gripping subtext that of which could easily related to real life or not.\" So the fact that everyone in this film is some kind of bully or some helpless person relates to a bunch of people online? Wow, where did I see that be implement in a dozen movies that has been produced years ago? Seriously, I do not see the slightest thing right with this movie and I am usually prone to these movies.",

My problem with this film is that both stories fail to soar - you have on one hand the chubby girl whose character screams \"suicide\" from her first scene, and the young hooker, who gets killed off (i.e. sent away to social services, \"exit stage left\") as soon as the relationship with the main character becomes ambiguous. In a similar way, all minor characters get turned over as soon as they try to make an impact in the story.I agree it's a dramatic film, but it tries to be too far-reaching and just self-destroys in the end. There is no moral, no story, no hope of salvation.Awesome Brody, but nothing else i haven't seen before.My vote : 6/10 - nice, but not that meaningful",

            "review_title": "A profound view on the sick modern society by means of the routine life of a teacher",
            "content": "\"Detachment\" (2011)The movie revolves around Henry Barthes (Adryen Brody), a high-school substitute teacher, who arrives at a vicious school where the students are as troubled as their teachers and parents. There is no apparent interest in studying at all. The school is considered to be a transfer dump for the worst kids in the district. Henry himself is suffering from his internal psychological problems and constantly haunted by memories of his dead mother, who committed suicide. The movie shows that people (both teenagers and their teachers) feel emotionally detached from each other. The plot is gripping. The suspense builds up perpetually. Every time you think you have reached the bottom, things go from bad to worse. There is no relief. One horrible scene goes after another.Collective images of teachers and students awake interest in school and educational system. But the movie is not just about it. It is only a part of the plot. It is complicated. The beauty of this movie comes within the subtext. It is about trying the best while \"getting through your day in the best possible way\" (Tony Kaye, director) and do as much as you can. \"Detachment\" is a profound view on the sick modern society by means of the routine life of a teacher.Throughout the entire film, we can hear an interrupted skillfully woven into the plot Henry's monologue, in which he shares his thoughts about life. The movie is a painful but timely reminder of the challenges of the modern society, which is becoming more and more cruel and indifferent. And it really makes a difference in the universe of those people who contemplate the meaning of life, who care about their destiny in this world.\"Detachment\" handles subjects like depression, loneliness, desperation, death, suicide, abuse, indifference, sympathy. And although these subjects are not new, they still do not lose their relevance. The film opens Pandora's box, full of problems the world still has not dealt with. At the end of the film, one will feel neither satisfied nor hopeful about life. The movie does not give answers to all questions, but it provides some moral messages that are necessary to understand the motives of people's behavior, to sympathize, and help them. The film puts into words and images what most people try to recognize about today's sick lifestyles and relationships. We are all strongly influenced by them.The movie is extremely emotional. There are many memorable heartbreaking and glowing scenes in it. They really send shivers down the spine. It is extremely hard to bear the suspense while watching some scenes. Charlie Seaboldt (James Edmund Caan), a school teacher, who always uses his brilliant sense of humor while managing any problems, and it allows him to hold his dignity and self-respect even in the most delicate situations. Carol Dearden (Marcia Jay Harden), the principal, betrays neither herself nor her work, even when she experiences very painful mental sufferings. She cannot bear to live, and she wants to die. But nevertheless this luxurious woman, who lies on the floor like a sick animal, finds the strength to continue working. Erica (Sami Gayle) acted brilliantly in the tragic scene when Henry decided to give her to the foster service, so rude and ruthless, without even warning her of his intention to do so! The scene when the officials took Erica away is one of the most heart-breaking moments I have ever seen in a movie! The way they gave all the characters some depth is what makes this movie so great.One should say special thanks to the theme music which is \"Empty\" by Ray LaMontagne. The song certainly strikes the viewer's hearts by adding tenderness and melancholy into their perception of the movie. The song makes us think we forget good things that happen in our life and only remember bad ones: \"I never learned my blessings, I choose instead to dwell in my disasters\". The song also contains an idea that our unpleasant emotional state often seems permanent to us, and that is the reason why we ask: \"Will I always feel this way? So empty, so estranged\"?At the end of the movie we see Henry reading \"The fall of Ushers\" by Edgar Allan Poe: \"With the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit... I looked upon the simple landscape of the domain, upon the bleak walls, upon the white trunks of decayed trees with an utter depression of soul. There was an iciness, a sickening of the heart\". Maybe the house of Usher is not merely an old decrepit building. Henry says it is also a symbol of the state of tormented souls. Henry is in a wasted classroom alone and it visually shows he is detached from the world. Maybe an empty school symbolizes that the modern educational system fails to respond to the challenges of the time.The movie produces a great impression due to unique vibes it evokes. Watching the movie requires some real effort. It the end, one feels a slight sense of dissatisfaction because of the impossibility to get answers to all the questions posed in the film. This is the type of a movie that produces feelings and thoughts which will linger after the film finishes. It is not a happy-end movie at all. If you are looking for an entertaining movie, then you should look for something else. But if you wish to see a deep provoking film, that raises more questions than it provides answers, then you will be rewarded with a film.The movie is definitely worth watching!My point is 10 out of 10.",

This film is a fine example of simply too much going on. The film is well cast, but that doesn't save a bad storyline. Stylistically the film must have been shot on a DSLR, and it looks as if the operator walked around with it freely in his hands for most of the movie, due to shaky camera work.We have numerous characters that are all dealing with what would seem to be their rock bottom. Instead of taking a few characters and delving into what brought them to this point, we have a movie that goes 0-60 in the opening scenes and stays that way throughout the whole film. There is no down time, it's just a constant bombardment of extreme conditions and emotions, which just doesn't feel real and is definitely not wholly believable.

            "content": "This film, like Last Temptation of Christ, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Donnie Darko, is amongst a very few to have succeeded in isolating the nature and power of humanity when developed in people, like Henry Barthes, as well as the predicament that comes along with the attempt to act on it. This humanity which inspires us to be better people manifests as a rescue and redemption impulse which we can sum up as \"don't let people get stuck in a hole if you can help show them how to get out of it\" \u2013 which is a bit like the Golden Rule (\"do unto others\u0085\" which we all know instinctively to be both right but also, more tragically, far from generally applied), the conjecture is that if you are human enough, like him, to know you are connected to others, albeit at arm's length, then to deserve your own self-respect (the only sort of respect that matters) you have to try to get a ladder to them. This is reason stumbling about in a world that can't see it for what it is, but rather only its bearer who is then put on a pedestal and trapped in the unwanted role of redeemer so that attempted escape can be accounted as treachery and denial of self. The victims do not go for the idea of the ladder being offered so as to climb up and think differently to get out of the hole; that would be true education of course: they grab the man instead and put him on the pedestal rather than his idea. The victims wish to place their burdens into his outstretched hands rather than trying to accept the solutions being proffered by them, thus burdening the potential educator with the role of saviour through bullying use of his own sense of decency against him, instead of releasing themselves by acting on what is actually being offered; which is an inch to them where they decide to go for a yard. This predicament shows that the instinct to help when acted upon can easily rebound because the desperation built up in the victims can blind them to the magical offer of self-redemption - real education - concerning their understanding of themselves and those around them. These outstretched hands of the caring person are trying to offer the victims the ladder to escape but that is not always recognised for what it is and the consequences can be dire because the failures of those outstretched hands are then pointed to by the cynic who gets to prove that trying to help losers is a waste of time, which is all he wants out of the situation; proof of the good sense of hauling the ladder up, because the Golden Rule fails: so the callous powers that are the root cause of the problem can get on instead with the dire work of damaging and unjust appropriations against general humanity with not only a clear conscience, but now as a virtuous act. This is the way that rule has always worked since ancient times so we are actually being shown the cause of the failure of our supposed democracy. Those outstretched hands should amount to the victim's chance to escape from a vicious imaginary trap made real by the inhumanity of others and the lack of any apparent understanding from the controllers of an all-pervasive and overpowering economic governing system as brilliantly illustrated by role of Mr Mathias. The missing step is in the igniting of the necessary self-belief and understanding which would enable the ladder to be accepted at arms-length rather than the impulse of rushing to clutch at the ladder-bearer being yielded to. There are those, understandably and obviously, who can't stop themselves from grabbing at and getting their hooks into what they see as a highly necessary saviour who is interpreted as having shown personal love to them anyway rather than humanity; interpreted as the making of some kind of pass, and towards whom they only have to give devotion to secure obligation, accepting the pass: thus missing the point and wrecking the deeply felt mission of Barthes towards people in general. That would be the hope of spreading education too would it not? It is a remarkable film about education and its true power and meaning and the whole engagement that it can entail. This is so important that it should be taught by educators everywhere because it is what we are like, and why we are not succeeding as we should be in this truer mission.

While I wasn't disappointed to have seen it, I have to say it came across more than a little heavy-handed. I'll tell it to you now, without spoiling the movie: the message is we're ruining our civilization by not raising our kids properly. So, if you want to sit through an hour and a half of bleakness to be spoon-fed that fairly obvious concept, there are worse ways to do it than to watch this film. It's a solid (if peculiar) cast of mostly character actors, who clearly felt a need to put their muscle behind this story; otherwise, they're strangely placed here. Everyone turns in perfect performances, sometimes in difficult roles (Caan's restrained kindly-but-scary is wonderful to behold), and visually this is a striking work. But beyond the surface, it's a bit thin in character, motivation and plot, so won't end up on anyone's Great Movies list.",

His performance, coupled with other superb actors, is only matched by the directing and unique animations included to deliver a powerful aesthetic work. The movie does not seek to answer any questions or provide any moral message, it illuminates and puts into words and images what most people fail to, or refuse to, recognize about today's increasingly dehumanized lifestyles and relationships. The dialogue is haunting and quite poetic, with many lines that stand out in the mind. This is the type of movie that will linger with you after the movie is finished and can resonate in a person. If you pay close attention, at least personally, I found that there is a great truth to be felt.I highly recommend this movie, it does not have high entertainment value or some outdated romantic back story but it is a beautiful work of art. I liked it that much at least, so I'd say it's worth a try watching.",

            "content": "I did see this movie a few days ago on TV, and it really caught my attention as being above the usual escapist entertainment movies. It deals with the detachment and corruption in all spheres of life, but especially the one dealing with school pupils, their parents and teachers.Instead of lovingly guiding their children throughout life, some of the parents just dump them in a school, expecting them to be perfected by school, teachers, psychologists, since parents are too busy slaving off for a corrupt system which expects them to be ideal workers like the cartoon character Sponge Bob, who had the mind of a child, and worked hard without question for a low wage and a void achievement of \"best month worker\".But teachers are as broken as parents; one is not made instantly wise and all-knowing by becoming a teacher, who anyway is expected to bring basic human knowledge to humans, not the love, empathy and relationships which are expected to be taught inside families.The main character, a substitute teacher, is a product of such a lifestyle, unable to be attached to anyone, who tries to be caring and helpful, but makes often mistakes and though he is drawn to goodness and love, doesn't really know the meaning of life and why love and goodness are necessary. He just urges his pupils to seek answers through knowledge and not to willingly accept all kinds of manipulative propaganda of marketing, where love of money is the top priority, but in the Bible it is called \"the root of all evils\".You may wonder why Bible and Christianity, since everywhere you can hear that Christians are often are (or shown to be) \"bigoted\", hypocritical, hateful and judgmental, especially with with all kinds of scandals related with the Church of Christ (body of believers) and priests. By the grace of God, i believe in His Son Jesus Christ, that Jesus died on the cross to pay for the sins of the world and was raised by God from the dead, so that anybody who believes this will be raised by God as well from death into eternal life through forgiveness of all sins for the sake of His Son Jesus Christ.So while this movie is helpful into raising questions about lack of love and detachment in this life, it doesn't say how to fix it, nor does it provide the stimulus to do so. It just says to seek answers. That's why i did in the past, finding the teachings of Lord Jesus Christ perfectly suitable for these problems - it contains rules and commands on how to love God and other people, what is good and what is evil/sinful. According to Christ we believe that God gives us strength to do good and love even our enemies, even though it seemed previously stupid, uncomfortable and unrewarding according to most secular teachings - we do this because of God's love, mercy and forgiveness, who opened for us the only door to salvation which is Jesus Christ.So if you're feeling dissatisfied with this world and seeking a better place - read the Bible, starting with the New Testament, which is easier to understand for starters, pray to God for guidance, forgiveness and repentance of sins, strength to live by Jesus' commandments and example. Also don't let the slander about God, Jesus and Christians keep you away from the truth in the Bible - since Jesus already warned about false prophets, whose deeds are far from their words, so not a self-proclaimed name of \"Christian\" does make one true, but their deeds according to Lord Jesus Christ.",

            "content": "Andrian Brody has the power to bring out the most profoundly sad roles and its not just because of his eye brows. He's a quiet and troubled teacher who's incapable of turning a blind eye toward those young misguided souls, despite the fact that he himself is suffering from a recently family member's death and constantly haunted by memories of his deceased mother. We started to introspect the question that can we maintain our saving grace or last shred of kindness if we areunder such circumstances, when our career is constantly getting sh*t atand ignored and even more tragically our faint hope for rising people's awareness and making a difference to the children still won't crumble into derelict. But IMO if we trim the sidekick story involving the unfinished romance with his colleague at all, the movie would be much more properly constructed, I'm kind of under the impression this line of story was not fully developed so instead of throwing a half-ass off- time life experience,divert some light that has been shed upon the redundant romance to the story with Erica, it would be my personal preference. The scenes when the officers took Erica away are some of the most heartrending moments I've ever beheld in cinema, in this perspective, Sami Gayle had strike me as a new scintillation among her generation. The always think it's rather intoxicating and predestined if some two total strangers started chatted on the street, and I expected more layer-developing conversations between these two. Of course he's been a father figure rather than a caring valentine to her otherwise the warmth would depraved to incestuous lust and perversion, but considering Erica's original recalcitrance and dangerously licentious life style, if His detached principles have had deviated a little, even just on the surface with more light-hearted bantering and edifying, the relationship between these two would be galvanized and worth more times rumination. I'm nitpicking in this film apparently. But I expected more from Adrian Brody, He can totally do his work just by his eyes, but in that case he'll stay a melancholic and poetically mysterious 'prince'. In some case the film only shows his dolorous and suffocating life and conveniently light-brushed some merriment, even when hes kissing his colleague his eyes were not looking at him. So in a way the character is still not quiet layered and chewy than I thought, detachment is the sort of thing he's been chasing for long and sometimes he did achieve, and we only get to see his own wound-licking after the fierce emotional confrontation. That's bit of tears-provocating due to the lack of main- characters' conversation. Surprisingly good moments: the humorous teacher's three ways of enchanting out a student's gangsta curse, His response when caught the kid committing animal battery live. The collective performances of the colleague is transcendental and brings this movie to another level, we can see those mid classed teachers' own collapsing doldrum in life and absolute powerlessness when confronting misunderstanding, ignorance from students and even spouses, and utter disrespect emerging from twelve direction and each of them adapt to this environment by either growing detachment. Some acting are relatively weak but won't affect the general quality. i also think the blackboard illustrations are well fitted but really movies should really try to not accentuating so heavily on the faces(I've seen quiet a few of them doing super close-ups on the faces, whether to catch their minimal facial expression changes or just for visual pleasures), for one that we started to not buy the story that Adrian with face will stuck in a substitute teacher like that and getting hurt, for two its bit of a clich\u00e9 these days",

It is a tough film to watch in some cases because it really does hit some nerves with the truths it deals with, it makes you empathise and truly feel for the characters and their inner struggle with day to day life.I feel as if every one should watch this film, not just for entertainment purposes. There is a huge reason it is my favourite film of the year, it just frames so many of the very real problems we see in, not only the education system but in our lives also. Adrian Brody, in fact everyone in this film gives a phenomenal performance and makes you truly believe they are struggling with the raw emotion they deliver.

            "content": "I have seen quite a few 'teacher movies' so far. Some movies (like Stand and Deliver or the Ron Clark Story) focus on the success of a young idealist teacher who achieves an unprecedented test score with a bunch of unruly and mostly poor minority kids. Some movies focus on factual teaching and the teaching environment (Up the down Staircase) but few movies actually tell about relationships and how to relate to people. (One Eight Seven-1997)I think Detachment is one of those few movies which can be placed in the third category. Detachment opens with a quote from the existentialist writer Albert Camus, \"And never have I felt so deeply at one and the same time so detached from myself and so present in the world.\" We possibly read this quote from the journal of a jaded substitute teacher named Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody) who happens to come highly recommended as the best sub on the call sheet. Camus always presented his readers with dualisms- happiness and sadness, dark and light and in this case attachment and detachment. Henry Barthes floats from school to school and tries to teach but his real responsibility is to maintain order and try to get his below grade level students caught up. Naturally, he never stays long enough in any school to form the slightest patina of sentient attachment.Let's face it. Henry doesn't really fit the 'teacher archetype'. For so long, teachers have been portrayed as trailblazers, saviours, agents of social change and the ultimate guides. The celluloid teachers start off as youthful (not in the physical sense-think about LouAnne Johnson-My Posse don't do Homework) idealists who think they can get to reach any kid if they try hard enough. Unfortunately, regardless of their academic training, they seem to be so detached from the harsh realities of the quotidian teaching environment. For instance, it doesn't matter that 'Up the Down Staircase' was made in 1967 because Ron Clark(2006) still seems to be as unprepared as Sylvia Barrett for what will face them. Surely somebody must have told them as a student \"Forget all the B.S they taught you in college. You can't learn how to teach by listening to a bunch of lecturers in a conference room.\" And for most of the time,these idealist celluloid teachers seem to be left alone in their fight to reach out for kids that are pushed down to the garbage of the education system and they remonstrate with their colleagues who just don't believe that every kid deserves one more chance.Moreover, most of these celluloid teachers don't have romantic relationships in their life. (Take Roberta Guaspari in Music of the Heart. She waits for her two young boys to become grown-up young men to date somebody after ten years) Is loneliness a prerequisite to become a devoted teacher? In 'Detachment' we see that not every teacher has to be another Jamie Escalante. All teachers have things that they have to deal with and they take their problems home with them at night and they just bring some of these problems with them back to school in the morning.Sometimes, the very helplessness of a teacher, being adrift in the sea of education with no answers, the very realization of that helplessness with no buoy at his reach while he should be the one throwing a buoy is what humanizes a teacher.That's why each one us feel that detachment every now and then. Somehow we're connected to everything and everybody and yet so detached. The two extremes or dualisms that we have to go for every day create this kind of explosive catharsis. Henry who had a troubled childhood, who have become so detached in the throes of apathetic students, blas\u00e9 colleagues and frayed administrations, still finds himself attached to a runaway teen (Sami Gayle)-who finds him gentle and the most kind, a creative but underestimated student (Betty Kaye) who sees him as a faceless man in an empty room, and a colleague (Christina Hendricks) who can be judgmental sometimes. I guess, these attachments are the very hope that Tony Kaye imprints in the hearts of the viewers in a seemingly mean, loveless world.",

We saw their improvement, how the got an actual help. Eventually, that's life. To finish your time helping yourself, helping others. this is the way to true happiness.

However, the subtext involves much greater themes of abandonment, parental responsibility, lost hope and the need for acceptance without judgment. There is no way to escape labeling this film as brilliant. There isn't a slow spot in the film's pacing, the acting from the entire cast is astounding and the script is amazingly executed. The main character, Henry, a substitute teacher, deals with the death of his mother as a child by care taking for everyone that comes close to him but himself. This dichotomy in his life comes to a head with two young girls that he has reached out to in very different (and dramatic) ways. By trying to give the love that he was denied for years, he has set himself up for a fall (and a rebirth) as both a man and a teacher.Anyone who has dealt with public schools as a student and certainly a teacher should watch this.",

I am not capable of analyzing this story.Watched it for a 2nd time just now. I am a fan of Adrien Brody and that is why I checked it out.This movie was/is extremely depressing from start to finish. Actually, it was overly depressing.The story is depicted in an extremely over-the-top depressing manner. Surely Adrien Brody was chosen for this 2011 movie role due to his performance on The Pianist (2002). I liked that the movie not only focuses on exploring the protagonist, but also shows glimpses of the troubles teachers go through, as well as glimpses of the troubles some teenage students have.There are many themes in this film and many possible interpretations and topics of discussion that I am incapable of putting into writing. My review certainly does not do this movie justice. I do not think I have the capability to give this movie the kind of review it deserves; maybe a really knowledgeable English professor could?The protagonist - Adrien Brody - depicts the saddest man in the world, who is also kind, and one must wait very patiently to find out why he is so sad. One answer is provided and it seems to suffice to answer this question. The two things he witnessed (?) in his life would forever traumatize anybody. This answer in the plot later made me question whether this story is based on a true story. The two things he witnessed (?) are fully plausible and surely have happened in real life countless times everywhere.Sami Gayle - the second protagonist - I think she did really well, especially her crying scene - it was heartbreaking. Very happy with her performance.James Caan - grandpa - I think he did good with his role. He was very believable.Christina Hendricks - she is a bombshell and yet her acting was very flat and overall very poor and immediately forgettable. Very disappointing.The rest of the supporting cast were decent (including Bryan Cranston) and immediately forgettable.Conclusion: this is a complex movie with hidden themes that are difficult to put into words. I feel this movie is a lot more complicated than meets the eye. It is definitely not most people's cup of tea. But those that not only decide to give this movie a shot and actually stick around until the very end, may be rewarded with some fulfillment.8/10",

It is full of cynicism and the entire film is shrouded in darkness that comes out exemplary in Adrien Brody's performance. What stayed with me the most was not the bleak lives the children live, but rather the look behind the scenes at the teachers. In one beautiful scene James Caan tells Lucy Lui's guidance counselor character that \"no one ever says thank you\". I don't think many people stop to think how their actions affect teachers, people who are essentially there to help them develop as people and support them. I hope this movie can inspire people to think back on their school life and maybe just write one teacher that stood out and say thank you. Brody's character gives narration throughout the film that give the story a good direction and while the climax of the movie is not surprising, it is beautifully done, with a flashback to Brody's mother that adds pain without being too obvious. Now the film could have ended at the climax with a dark and bleak ending, but it does not. The ending in my eyes is beautifully done and left me in tears, not out of sadness but out of hope.",

People around you looks really stupid. They are not educated and they do not know what is going on in the world.

It was the suicide scene of the depressed girl who made cupcakes. Everything in that scene was so pitiful, in a good way. The white frosted smiley faces on the cupcakes, the gentle sadness expressed by the girl, and the sympathetic look Brody shot her got me teared up. Anytime I am acting on stage, thinking of this scene in particular helps me with my fake cry, haha. The theme may seem melodramatic.

            "content": "I'm afraid I have to count this among the few films this year that I was quite excited by but ultimately left me disappointed. I found a lot of it was quite cheap (mostly from a good deal of the melodramatic acting on display) and throughout the film I couldn't wrap my head around the choice of shooting. The camera-work felt very out of place. For example, one scene could have five or six different angles with one using grain, another with use of quick zooms and then another with quick pans and the culminating effect felt very fake, as if belonging to a run-of-the-mill TV crime drama. It genuinely hampered my viewing of the film. Adrien Brody does well enough despite wearing almost the same facial expression for most of the film and the few touching moments of the 97 come from his interaction with Grandpa. There's chemistry there but there are simply no sparks between other characters. There are a few good cameo performances from Bryan Cranston and James Caan yet they don't seem to add anything to the film and this is amongst dubious performances from the supporting cast (Marcia Gay Harden, Christina Hendricks and Betty Kaye). There was a lot more to be left wanting from them. On the other hand, that's possibly the result of the writing as their characters don't feel overly convincing.I hate singling an actor out as the worst but I can't not mention Lucy Liu who overacted just about every second she was on screen. She was the main culprit of the melodramatic acting scattered amongst this film. Cringe just about does it justice. One of it's bigger problems is that it tries to handle too much. Education, youth, family problems, childhood trauma and prostitution amongst others and the result is that none of these issues are tackled full-on instead being treated bit by bit.Bryan Cranston said he took his part in this as he liked the script and believed in it. I don't doubt his judgement, personally, but if that's the truth then I'm very surprised by the film's execution of it. A long way off for a director who (just about) gave us American History X. I loathe being so negative about a film, one of which there were elements to like, but I guess it stems from the great sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction Detachment left me with.",

Brody is the supply teacher thrown into a chaotic, hostile inner city school where the kids are menacing with tons of attitude and no apparent interest in learning anything. He's only there for a few weeks, so could easily do the minimum, pick up his paycheck and clear out, but he cares about these kids. A local hooker takes a shine to him and he tries the same tough love with her, but she's so damaged that she clings like a limpet to anyone who shows her the smallest kindness. (Reminded me a bit of 'Five Easy Pieces', where Jack NIcholson gets the same treatment, despite being a hopeless drifter.) Slightly melodramatic conclusion with another damaged kid who gets too close to him for comfort, but basically a powerful, involving and depressingly credible account of the modern classroom. P.S. Watch out for one of his fellow teachers and try not to go \"It's Pete!\"",

It was good, but I doubt that it's going to change anyone's life.I really enjoyed the gritty realism. I like movies with dark themes that aren't afraid to explore the darker aspects of human nature, such as Taxi Driver and Night of the Living Dead. Unlike those movies, however, redemption does seem to be a possibility in Detachment. Thus, it falls into what I might call a very thematically dark, inspirational story. If you're looking for something light-hearted and warm, it's best you avoid this. I'm sure you'll find it too emotionally draining.",

I have to say though, Lucy Liu's scene is particularly good. also the whole troubled man - young prostitute thing is totally played out, and the movie doesn't add anything new for that matter, just the same predictable unoriginality that stretches out through the entire 98 minutes (which felt a lot longer)",

            "content": "Pretty much the only place Detachment suffers is a few moments of choppy, unnatural acting. However, it's a rare drama that doesn't rely on bold, pitch-perfect performances to carry the film, but rather a brutal yet focused mindset on the real issues the film examines with honesty and no false answers to try soften the blow.Adrian Brody plays a substitute English teacher named Henry, who is filling in for a week or so at a failing inner city high school. His first encounter with the students in his first hour class results in an unruly, disrespectful young man being sent out within minutes. Henry is completely untouched by any words thrown at him, yet not in any power-asserting way. He kicks out the student with literally no care. He doesn't tell the student to go the dean's office or anywhere specific; go anywhere, just get out of the classroom if he doesn't want to learn.Henry is also a great teacher. His students love him even after only having him for only a couple days. He is not nourishing, but he is understanding, letting his students talk to him while keeping his distance. His most prominent characteristic seems to be the titular sense of Detachment. Henry is not the optimistic teacher we've seen in countless education based films where a teacher strive to lift his or her student's spirits up. Henry is cynic, haunted by a past not made clear but hinted at. He talks about teachers entering the field with aspirations to make a difference, build future leaders, and change a culture of failure into one of achievement, before running into the harsh reality that there is only so much an educator can do. We're left to wonder if Henry is talking about himself or not.The film does not follow a conventional plot. It exists within a certain time frame, but one that can be placed at any time at any school in the country. Watching the movie is like looking through a lens that shows a general picture of the public school system. Tony Kaye doesn't use this picture to make any statements. He's not interesting in giving any opinions. Detachment is a true work of art that takes an objective look at a vital issue without pointing any fingers, not calling for instant resolutions.Too many dramas place too much weight on their actors to carry the film's power. Detachment hold it's own. Many sequences of dialog do not sound natural \u2013 particular scenes where Henry has one on one conversations with students \u2013 and they are the weak spots in this film. However, these scenes hardly affect the viewing experience because the film never sets itself up to be all about singular performances. What's most important is what those moments add to the story, and how they reflect reality, even if it is not a perfect reenactment of reality. That said, Adrien Brody as Henry is not to be thrown under the bus. Brody leads an ensemble that does every character justice, even with limited screen time.Detachment is not a film out to inspire anyone or give ideas on how to fix the system. It does nothing more than what a piece of filmmaking should do: make viewers think. Hopefully watching this film will cause one to consider what really is standing in the way of inner city children and a good education, and the answer is not bad teachers or not enough funding. Can you see what it is? I guess the follow up to that would be, \"can anything really be done about it?\"",

He has always been a favorite of mine, and his role in Detachment only solidifies my belief that he is one of the elite actors of our time. I've seen several of Adrien Brody's movies in the past - my favorite being The Experiment - up until I saw this film. I have many friends that are teachers, and it's almost sad to consider the fact that they may feel just as \"detached\" as Mr. Brody's character. The film is an eye-opener to anyone who has ever neglected the hard truths that plague our society. The day will come when all of us have to ask ourselves what we've accomplished in our lives, however large or small. Great film, and one of the best I've seen in a long time.",

If it just followed these teachers and observed their lives, it would be a better movie. The actors are all good enough to carry that kind of movie. Instead of taking this approach, it shoe-horns the material onto a narrative that doesn't fit. How many movies have you seen where a well- meaning man takes in a teenage prostitute, not for sex? If you've seen it as much as I have, you're probably pretty sick of it. It's a fantasy that caters to the viewers. It has nothing in common with reality. It's also the centerpiece of \"Detachment.\"The chalk illustrations and flashbacks are similarly ill-suited. Flat realism would be a lot more effective.I do recommend seeing this movie, especially if you liked \"American History X.\" I feel the same way about both movies--they have some interesting things to say, but those things are diminished by the narrative.",

            "content": "Director Tony Kaye, and writer Carl Lund have manage to create a heart shattering master piece, called Detachment.Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody), is a substitute teacher who has a real, and rare talent to connect with his students\u0085yet he continues to ignore his gift, and his heart. He spends his days conveniently avoiding any and all emotional connections by never staying anywhere long enough to form an relationship, in school and out. Then a new assignment places him at a public school with a frustrated, angst filled student body, neglected by their parents, and some of their teachers. Henry soon becomes a role model to these scary, disturbed kids. In finding an unlikely emotional connection to the students, teachers, and a runaway teen he takes in from the streets, Henry realizes that he's not alone in his life and death struggles to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world.This movie was outstanding, which doesn't to a surprise to me. Tony Kaye, and Adrien Brody never fail to impress.Touching on subjects that most people choose to ignore, like family's neglecting their children and never truly giving them what they need, teachers powerless to truly help their students because of the students attitudes, and because of the school board ultimately only care about profits, along with having the best test scores. It really hits your heart. I for one, cried several times.A film that portrays the want, the need to be detached in a f#@$% up world\u0085but never truly being able to let go. If you like movies with a purpose, that are artistic, and real \u2013 definitely check this out out!

It was about a substitute teacher who didn't want to get emotionally attached to anything or anybody, and through his journey, he became attached to several people. I truly felt the emotions of the film throughout, and would highly recommend it to anybody looking to watch a film that brings out a sense of reality.If anything, it does make you think about how little some parents do to support their children, and how some parents react to their children's differences in personality.",

Wave after wave it hits you in the gut, while leaving just enough obscurity to keep you thinking, to pull you in.Throughout the story multiple narratives are woven in, but they all seem to pass by unnoticed by Henry, who is absorbed in his own pain. All that trauma stemming from childhood is masked by him with an air of \"detachment\". Unable to form bonds, he moves from school to school, with the only outlet of emotion being his writing. Seeing his shadow reflected in his pupils, he unconsciously gives them the love and help he never had growing up.All the while his grief and insecurities blind him to the fact that he is the only person with a positive influence on others. His fear of failing those he feels responsible for, is in fact aversion to the possibility of facing his own neglect that has scarred him since childhood. As such he rejects every helping hand from the people in his life. Running from his demons, they ultimately catch up and manifest in tragedy.He always thought that he was different, but then he realized he had his flaws too. He forgives those imperfections and allows himself to form attachments. In the end, we're not different, we're all the same.",

First of all Edgar Allen Po can learn a lesson here, never has there been something which fortifies my nihilistic views quite like the American public school system. The movie takes place in Queens/ maybe a little Brooklyn Ny. I don't mind the late night bus rides on queens blvd with underage prostitutes, cause that was the real common case pre 2000 NY. Though I believe the movie was early 1990's. Makes sense for that time. The Top tier cast playing these roles most likely as homage to their own teachers and teachers everywhere adding to their overall delivery and simply put my respect for them as actors and people. Brody is stellar playing at home on queens blvd, probably took that bus as a kid himself. James Caan offers the only much needed comedic relief, making it all the more memorable. I can't mention every actor cause the movie just needs to be watched and you should stop reading reviews and find a way to watch it... and stop ubiquitously assimilating yourself to movies that don't teach you anything worth while.",

After thinking he didn't have the look for a movie star I can admit I'm wrong. His character is constantly admirable and noble. Hes the shining light in a hopeless world. The kids are doomed and the teachers and staff are burnt out and abused.It's a poignant film that shows you can make a difference in your own world even as it turns worse. I like that message and the relationship between him and the teen prostitute who he takes in and cares for is the light of the film.The cinematography is also great. The 3 stars are off for showing some sexual and offensive imagery to shock. The suicide was also a bit of a cheap trick.I'd recommend watching this film if you're in the right place.

The black humor is punchy, with a great riff by James Caan as a stand-in for one of the school administrators, dealing with two of the \"troubled youths\".If you are looking for a story with uplifting characters, don't go here. Every minute is filled with bitterness and disappointment for the teachers, the students, their families. Solid acting from all the supporting characters, and a number of cringe moments.I will be interested to see how this gets released. Much tougher film than \"American X\" to watch. Well crafted story telling through film. You have to pay careful attention to the beginning, where Brody appears to be being interviewed by someone in an official capacity and may be an unreliable narrator of his story.Finally, as Tony Kaye pointed out last night, watch for the color Red.",

The plot focuses mainly upon the life of Henry Barthes, an emotionally overwhelmed substitute teacher who often cares too much for his own good. The movie is serious and heavy-handed with Brody's character often giving strong judgments that are unrealistically tolerated throughout. The actors do a fine job of portraying their characters with exception to Christina Hendricks. Hendricks character introduction is as unrealistic as I could imagine. At times the film will switch over to focus on the other teachers, presenting teaching as a thankless job and life of harassment. Overall the story is muddled and not given space to breathe. Despite the all-star cast, two young actresses steal the spotlight. Sami Gale and Betty Kaye give heartfelt performances that I wish were more expanded upon. In fact, the celebrity presence among the teaching staff serve to be distractions from the empathy we are meant to feel elsewhere. A word of warning: political bias is very present. So if you enjoyed Waiting for Superman, you might take umbrage to the narrative.",

Having the reality of this talkie (no spoilers) delivered with such high artistry, makes the message more bearable. A film is the result of a complex and difficult number of task: writing a good script, casting the right actors, editing the best way one can do, all under the magic wand of a director, producer, etc. In all these, Detachment excelled!

There will be one student who you care for and no matter what you do it could go either way.

The main character cares for his students but learns by the end sometimes you have to be willing to go the extra mile to make a difference. The overall theme of the film is perspective means everything. Teachers especially first year teachers need to watch this if for no other reason then to remind themselves that caring does not make you weak. You need to go the extra mile for your students because sometimes you might be the only teach who is willing to. On your worst day you are a students best hope.",

No job, no mother, no father, no grandpa, no real friends, no wife, no children....\nGives away the one thing he does have. Why? So he can wallow in his own chaos, loneliness, existential dread, bleak, black, dark, emptiness?\nAnd what he gives away, but more importantly, who he gives away, is the one person who knows his true value.

That's what has you howling at the screen - Man, how can you do that?\nYou want to fall to your knees. You want to turn it off. You want to re-write the script. But there it is. Just as large as life. Tragedy.Henry's living proof that the mistakes we make in life come so easy, even though at the time they seem so hard. We make them alone, and they make us alone.So I guess my little spoiler wasn't such a spoiler after all. Mostly because that scene isn't so obvious. Until it hits.

Of all the places to find something the that's moved me beyond words.This movie is just heartbreaking. I was in tears from the beginning. Look it's not a happy film. If you're expecting to see something like Lean on Me or Gangsters Paradise let me stop you right there. There are no happy endings and feel good moments. I lie. There is one and the movie is so depressing that this moment of happiness makes you cry even harder. The sad reality is that teachers face such a hard time. They face abuse in every aspect and then when one comes along and retires to help it's misinterpreted by both the student and their peers. I can't imagine what hell teachers go through everyday. Parents either don't care or can't be assed with their kids. Kids are just acting out like they see their parents. And teachers have to suffer threats of violence everyday but cannot defend them self at all. The system is broken and no one seems to care except these teachers who literally risk their lives by trying to help.The acting in this movie is outstanding. You feel each teacher's pain and struggle. And you feel for the students to a degree. You have this young girl who is barely 16 whoring herself out there. Where are her parents for gods sake? There are too many stories like this for anyone to care about one individual.Sometimes I wonder in order to help someone do you need to be broken first? Because you can't help yourself on your own. But helping someone else maybe just maybe you can fix yourself somewhere down the line.Watch this movie because we can no longer hide behind the reality that this is. There is only so much we can ignore and continue to allow to happen in day to day life. Children nowadays are going to have so many problems because society is scared to do something for fear of being accused of child abuse and neglect. Can't you see that by doing nothing and turning a blind eye, this in it's own right is abuse of the worst kind.",

Worst of all was the torture and murder of an innocent cat.That was by far totally disgusting and the reaction in the end was \"well the kid felt like the cat\" again the writer trying to show some \"honesty \" by that as answer to harming and killing a totally innocent being-that was the biggest load of crap in the whole film-that sort of behavior is psychotic. I personally have had a very hard life myself, I have been violated, I have been abandoned as a child, I was homeless, I have overcome drugs and this is why I feel this movie is misleading un-realistic and weak because with all that happened to me I never harmed an innocent animal and I did feel horrible for any self destructive things I did after I realized they were wrong and I did not obviously kill myself as an answer.This film is not brave and frankly it could have been.It chose to show those who harm and than those who realize the harming is going on but do very little about it.Everyone -every single character just acted like their were stuck, frozen in self pity,smothered by disappointment, paralyzed by pain.We can not choose what happens to us most of the time but at some point after we can always choose what we do about it.This film is just a dead end and a cop out.I wish I had not wasted my time watching it.",

I suppose its to represent freedom and mobility (social mobility) perhaps.\n\nI thought that Adrien Brody did well portraying the substitute teacher, someone who can guess what may be behind some of his temporary pupils problems and issues but never having the time to be able to fully work with any of them, while we also see that he has his own emotional stresses in his own family life.\n\nThis is a sad watch but its a good film. I liked the variety of characters present and I thought the film was well casted too, so overall I would recommend this film, yes.",

Director Tony Kaye is not content to tell a straight story about inner city school kids and teachers, He has to show off his chops with  flashbacks, voice overs, glaringly symbolic visuals, and every other trick in the book. It's annoying.\nOn top of that, there are numerous sub plots going on. Teacher Henry Barthes (Adrian Brody) takes in a young hooker (Sami Gayle) in some kind of half-assed attempt at rehabilitating her. The school principal (Marcia Gay Harden) is being laid off because the school's test scores aren't meeting government requirements. Henry, whose mother committed suicide when he was seven, is dealing with his dying grandfather, who is in a nursing home. That's only three  of the sub plots; there are several more. It's like a rather morose version of John Sayles. \nJames Caan is a standout as a hard-edged realist teacher. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. But they're dealing with a messy, scattered script that's more of a collage than a story. \nIt's all very solemn and despairing. Too bad, because Adrian Brody is a fine actor. But here, I felt like he was a puppet with Tony Kaye pulling his strings. When giving a depressed student advice, Henry tells her \"We're all the same. We all feel pain. We all have chaos in our lives...But if you write it out, it will all be OK.\" How about: \"No one wants to think about what it takes to become somebody, to get out of the sea of pain that we all have to get out of.\" I don't know how Brody got those lines out without choking on them. \nThere's altogether too much angst going on here, and the artsy direction gets in the way of the story. But good acting makes up for a multitude of sins.",

First I will start off with the positives because most of the review will be me trashing the film after I name it's positives. Adrian Brody did give a great performance in the film and I kept wishing throughout it that the film was as good as he was in it. A few more are that James Caan cracked me up in a weird hilarious scene and the young prostitute who hung out with Adrian Brody's character did do good at showing emotions when things got tough with her. Now on with the negatives because there are a ton. First off, the movie has way too many plot lines going on and it has way too many characters including some who are only in a few scenes like Bryan Cranston's, Blythe Danner's, and James Caan's. The movie completely wastes the talents of these fine actors and they did not contribute one memorable thing out of this whole movie. The plot lines could have worked but there was never a clear focus on anything going on and you don't end up caring about anything yu see on screen. First the movie tries to establish a relationship going on between Adrian Brody and the young prostitute, then it tries to show this horrible society that goes on around the school, then it shows these random scenes of teachers gathering around for meetings, also it shows Adrian Brody visiting his father in the hospital, and then lastly, it tries to establish this bond between Adrian Brody and the class he teaches while also trying to be really thought provoking and preachy with it's depressing messages, and it was all very mind boggling and messy for me and I can't imagine any normal person being able to soak all that in on one single viewing because I certainly didn't and I most certainly won't be revisiting this film anymore whatsoever in my lifetime, just because of how pretentious and depressing it got as it went on. I really did want to like this movie and for a little bit I was giving it the benefit of a doubt, but an hour in, I just stopped caring about the whole movie and was just waiting for it to end. If the movie would have been just about Adrian Brody and the relationship with his class and cut out all the pretentious preachy crap and the multiple unmemorable plot lines, the movie wouldn't have been so daunting to sit through and it would have been more effective. Considering that this film comes from the director who had brought us the great effective drama American History X, I expected a hell of a lot more. Overall, I really don't want to talk about this movie anymore because I get upset thinking about it and this movie is just a clear example of wasted potential.",

The viewpoints are multiple and largely unharmonized, yet they all offer a vision of pain and suffering.  The particulars differ, yet the sense of individual isolation in a chaotic and uncaring universe is unified through the elegiac tone of the movie.  The sense of existential despair is responded by the stoic Mr. Barthes who endures and carries on his duty to be a good teacher and a decent human being.  Yet his Kantian Imperatives is honed by deep schism in psyche and memory.   He reminds me of Detective Cole in True Detective Season 1.  Somber and suffering souls bear witness of life honorably, dutifully, yet without false hope. \n\nThe one critical scene we see Barthes read among the detritus and chaos around him.  The order of the universe lies in his life of mind instead of the sensory life itself.  Embodied in moral imperatives,  Mr. Barthes is the essential stoic's \"ataraxia\", a serene calmness against all the odds yet not detached from the love of life itself.  \n\nWhat marks this movie from any other happier-ending ones is the absolute confidence in the present:  The danger lies in the joyful tears of Erica rushing toward him.  One fears more pain than joy in the universe however the beautiful sunset in the shaded grove looked at that moment of embrace.",

It is an odd film, erratic at times and raw in its portrayal of communities with a low socioeconomic status.  The documentary feel enhances the realism of the story.  You don't feel as if you are watching characters - you feel as if you are watching real kids with real problems.  Unfortunately, this style requires the film to move slowly and without much action, so it does turn into a very long 100 minutes.  The story centers around Adrien Brody, who plays a substitute teacher that reaches out to these kids on a level that they can understand.  Unlike \"Stand and Deliver\" or \"Lean on Me,\" Brody has his own circumstances that stand in the way of his success.  Pieces of this film are predictable because the story so accurately portrays the daily encounters of teachers in their classrooms.  The highlight of the film is Lucy Liu as she shows the frustration with misled students that teachers cannot ever reveal.  I was also quite taken with Sami Gayle, who acted beyond her years in this role.  \"Detachment\" moves at a snail's pace and will likely ruin your night, but any person involved in public education will be able to relate to these characters on a deep level.",

            "content": "Tony Kaye's Detachment is like his feature film debut American History X in its bleak depiction of America's youth, trapped within the bureaucracy of public education, an institution that which they lack an understanding of, causing them to lash out in acts of cruelty and malice systemic of the failures of government sanctioned institutionalization, knowledge and empathy replaced by ignorance and competition. Indicative of Kaye's characteristic dissatisfaction for the culturally degenerative firmament of America in the twenty-first century, Detachment examines the failures of public education in America, depicting the role of the teacher as more warden and jailor than educator and counselor, Kaye's chosen subjects down trodden civil servants held back by the anger of their students and the economic strictures of the nation's poorest and most racially volatile residential districts. In Adrian Brody's Henry Barthes, the viewer is afforded a veritable reincarnation of Kaye's previous protagonist, Edward Norton's Neo-Nazi turned social activist Derek Vinyard, Barthes' internalized rage quelled by a poetic soul, erupting in fits of isolated panic when provoked by the very worst of society's machinations of arbitrary law and order. Like American History X, Detachment is nearly suffocating in its dark dramatic tone, the dour halls of Kaye's public high school lending an impenetrability to the characters within, the torch of enlightenment unattended, leaving a whole generation of children scrabbling in the dark, capitalistic antagonism affording only the meager light of a single lit match. Where Kaye's feature film debut found him investigating racial prejudice and violence in Southern California at the dawn of the twenty-first century, his fourth film finds him interrogating the survivors of his prior social apocalypse, his public educators tied down by the ego of discontentment engendered by the detachment of racism that has continued to course through the American subconscious in the proceeding ten years.\n\nAs a successor to what is possibly the greatest social drama of our time, Detachment is comparatively engaged in a discussion largely pre-determined, Kaye's rhetorical flourishes on the importance of an ever diminishing liberal education heavy handed, but restrained by the subtleties afforded in Carl Lund's script and through the deft performances of its exceptional cast. If Kaye is a director's director, than his oeuvre is perhaps most marked by its unrelenting authorial style, Kaye's films less about interpretation than they are about elicited reaction, his films provocative in their engagement with topics already laden with a socially pre-conditioned response. And Detachment is no exception, decidedly brutal and effectively moving, Kaye's dissatisfaction echoing our own resentment towards an ingrained cultural disengagement, America in the twenty-first century remarkably insincere and prone to satire, but without the knowledge of where that insincerity and ridicule stems from, causing further division and turmoil within the culture. While some might find Kaye's stubborn cynicism exhausting, and American History X is nothing if not unmistakably critical, Detachment possesses an empathy for its characters that proves optimistic, even if the battles waged don't always culminate in success. While the film's conclusion leaves its characters in much the same quandary in which it finds them, Kaye's direction imbues a familiarity with his characters that proves empathetic and diagnostic of the lack of concern in public education in America at large, the solution dependent on our response to the film's comprehensively informed satire.\n\nIn Henry Barthes, Kaye has seemingly distilled the spirit of Derek Vinyard to his bare essentials, the anger of an upbringing found lacking in proper emotional support and economic stability fostering an adult lacking in social stability, the torments of his past informing his impersonally detached nature in the present. While Henry undoubtedly cares deeply for his fellow teachers and students, his status as a substitute teacher enables him to leave before becoming too emotionally attached to any one school district, classroom, or location, constant motion and change negating the effects of what is a meager and hard earned existence. Like his students, Henry feels the undercurrents of oppression surging forth as anger, a socially propagated affliction of a culture in a state of arrested development engendered by the very lack of education that Henry is actively engaged in instilling into a stagnant national intellect. When Henry says that he understands that his students are angry, or when he takes in a young prostitute off the street out of sheer charity, his own intelligence is temporarily lent to an American youth emotionally and mentally abandoned, the public schools little more than police states, the children put under their care abused, neglected, and ignored. In Kaye's film, all of his characters are dissimilarly detached, their very inability to connect with one another ironically communal, if only they could reach out and see each other in order to transcend the culturally regressive traits that have kept them deaf, dumb, and blind.\n\nPerhaps the most pervasive aspect of Detachment comes in its ability to articulate the incoherence of teenage angst as a symptom of an ephemeral maturity, proffered as a possibility, but with no clear social avenues by which to reach it. If Henry Barthes serves as any indication, adulthood carries the baggage of adolescence around with it, our formative years spent in the American public education system alternatively deleterious or transformative to our own intellectual and emotional growth, our nation's teachers the first line of defense against the violence of racism and social prejudice, so long as we give them the freedom of authority to educate. Without the knowledge of good and evil, right and wrong, pure and corrupt, Kaye's film provides the evidence to make it unmistakably clear that the civil turmoil depicted in his American History X will continue, anger the physical manifestation of psychological neglect. It's impossible to come away from any film directed by Tony Kaye in an apathetic manner, his film's provocations immediately familiar in their sources of criticism and indictment, his dissatisfaction echoing our own subconsciously felt grievances, and informing our consciously held complaints. As a social activist, there is no director currently making films quiet as effective in eliciting a volatile response from the tacitly disengaged masses, and Detachment, the spiritual successor to his masterful American History X, is perhaps his greatest achievement yet, diagnostic of the social ills of a lack of a proper public education, else we remain in a culture divided by the color of our skin and the size of our respective bank accounts.",

It's an entire metaphor about life, it's ups and downs, how it effects everyone differently and how each individual person copes.

His interactions with Sami Gayle (also excellent) as Erica are particularly poignant; this narrative is certainly the most honest, well-crafted through-line of the film--effectively avoiding the often grossly glamorous \"hooker with a heart of gold\" trope-- but it gets a bit lost in the muddled myriad of other half-baked stories and characters. \n\nThere's also such a mishmash of stylistic tropes, seemingly thrown in at random (Malick-esque poetic voice-over, documentary interviews, hand-drawn animation, photo montage, jump-cuts, dream-like flashbacks) that serve to confuse and distract rather than support. Even the ending seems to have far less to say about the overwhelmingly bleak circumstances of these characters than what feels necessary.

            "content": "This movie has a great central performance by Adrien Brody, and parts of it are undeniably powerful, but it's also an incredibly messy piece of work that feels like it was adapted straight from the screenwriter's random notes to himself, rather than an actual finished screenplay. This movie just kind of throws a lot of melodrama and despair at a wall; some of it sticks, a good bit of it does not. I can't say it's a very good movie due to its extremely rough, unfinished quality, but I also wouldn't tell anyone not to watch it if they were interested.\n\nThe central plotline of the movie focuses on a substitute teacher (Brody) who is sent to fill in for a month in an English class in a rather bad public high school. There are a lot of subplots thrown in, sometimes seemingly at random, but they do all boil down to one consistent theme: the American public education system fucking sucks, but it's more the fault of parents, administrators, and children than of the teachers. Actually, the movie portrays most of the teachers as noble, suffering souls, and most of the parents as evil, stupid, vile monsters. This movie will make you hate high school children and their parents.\nThe movie has a whole bunch of great actors, but then proceeds to waste them with about five minutes or less screentime for each: Marcia Gay Harden, Christina Hendricks, Tim Blake Nelson, James Caan, Blythe Danner, Lucy Liu, and Bryan Cranston (BRYAN FUCKING CRANSTON) are all given a couple of brief scenes each (Cranston only gets about one minute!). Brody does do a good job holding the center of the movie together, and for me the most interesting and successful of the many subplots involved him sheltering an underage prostitute (Sami Gayle). The movie begins with apparent documentary footage of real teachers talking about their jobs, then just kind of lurches around from one scene to the next. It feels more like a rant than a narrative at points, though admittedly a fiery and compelling rant. This is only the second completed fiction film by Tony Kaye, whose previous fiction film was American History X way back in 1998. (He also made a documentary about abortion called Lake of Fire which I haven't seen yet.) Based on those two films, the guy clearly has an effective, angry, powerful way of talking about big important issues, but he could work on discipline and form. I don't demand that every movie be a slick, uniform narrative, of course, but in this case it often feels less like experimentation and more just like a straight-up mess. This movie also has some of the most laughably amateur lighting I've ever seen in a real movie - one scene in particular has Tim Blake Nelson apparently casting sharp shadows in every direction in his house. Who let that happen? \nStill, as chaotic and seemingly random as this movie can be, I'd still say it's worth seeing as a realistic, depressing antidote to those inspiring-teacher movies everyone hates. The movie it reminds me most of is Half-Nelson with Ryan Gosling, which I thought was a pretentious mess (when I saw it 7 years ago, admittedly). This is also a pretentious mess, but for some reason I liked it better.",

            "content": "A dark chronicling of the sad state of the American Public School System, through the eyes of a long-term substitute teacher (Adrien Brody), wrestling his own demons whilst trying to make a difference both professionally and personally during his latest assignment.\n\nTony Kaye's \"Detachment\" is not the lecture I was expecting. It's an almost spiritual study of a system; a broken one, flawed (and as suggested) not inherently but by larger societal problems too broad and numerous to fully grasp or understand. It assesses these issues not with hope but with pitch black honesty. No solutions given but the disturbing thought that some things will never change. Kaye uses the phenomenal performance of Adrian Brody to ground us in the drama. We think at first this will be one man's story, but the narrative's concerns are much broader. This reminded me of \"American History X,\" a masterpiece, also directed by Kaye. It showcases a career best performance (Ed Norton in that movie) in a character piece that isn't so much about a personal journey as it is a grand statement about a specific social problem that will continue to thrive with no end in sight. In \"Detachment,\" Kaye's technique is equally experimental, in a story that's even less streamlined. Brody is definitely the star of the movie, but is not necessarily the focus. We are violently thrust into the lives of a myriad characters; unexpectedly and frantically at times. It could be argued that \"Detachment\" lacks focus to a fault, but I didn't feel this. Kaye's creation works as collage, similar to but not as extreme as Terrence Malick's take on WWII in \"The Thin Red Line.\" As with \"American History X,\" Kaye's stance is obvious and moment to moment scenes are a bit preachy, but none of this detracts from the established tone and eventual takeaway of this socially conscience,  effortlessly powerful movie. The film's cold, apocalyptic final shots aptly conclude a bleak portrait. One that's relentlessly grim, sure, but a bold work of cinema that leaves a lot to ponder.",

You'll learn some things about yourself, your emotions, other people, and society in general. All of this is capable, of course, by some very powerful performances from big names like Adrien Brody, James Caan, Lucy Liu, etc. It's rare to find comfort in sadness, but with the intelligence of this film it is quite possible.

I anticipated at least a tug at the heart strings after reading the descriptive blurb. Adrian Brody was made for emotionally-charged films. Has there ever been a man with such an expressive face/eyebrows? For me, he never fails to captivate my attention.\n\n In this story, Brody plays a jaded substitute teacher, who tries very hard to shut everyone out of his life and remain unbeholden to anyone. The students quickly warm to him, but he remains untempted to put down any roots. Moving beyond his usual, solitary attitude, he helps a young woman that has been living on the streets. When their friendship cultivates, he cuts himself loose, in perhaps the most upsetting scene of all. \n\nIssues such as bullying and teenage suicide are also addressed, but after such a stark underlining, there fails to be a bright spot at the end of the tunnel. It is a film driven by a frustration and disquietuide concerning society today, and it drives it's point painfully home. The realism prevents the emergence of a save-the-day hero, perhaps leaving the audience a little flat and depressed, but the serious persistence of the film is to be commended.",

Unfortunately, he didn't make that many films and those that he did - \"Lobby Lobster\" and \"Black Water Transit\" - didn't quite reach a bigger audience. As a result, I was happy to come across \"Detachment\" which proves that Kaye hasn't lost any of his style or starkness. \n Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody) is a substitute teacher brought in to a struggling urban high school to teach English and work with kids who are performing at a very low grade. Being a substitute is exactly the way Henry likes it as he deliberately tries to avoid making genuine connections with people (and that includes his pupils). As time goes on, though, Mr. Barthes realises his pupils' needs for his input which forces him to confront his own demons and isolation.\n \n\"And never have I felt so deeply at one and the same time so detached from myself and so present in the world.\"\n As the film opens, this is the quote from French philosopher Albert Camus, that's scribed onto a blackboard before we are introduced to the protagonist and the personal conflict he finds himself in. On the one hand, he's a caring individual but on the other, he deliberately keeps a distance from people as he's consumed by a guilt that doesn't belong to him. His detachment is also reflected in the frustrated and disillusioned pupils he teaches, making this a melting pot of emotionally dysfunctional people. It's this very mirroring in the individuals that make this quite a thought provoking character study, as well as a diatribe on the state of the American educational system and the problems therein.\n Kaye shoots the film with an edgy, fly on the wall approach, utilising the shaky-cam technique and numerous close-ups that bring you closer to the characters and their inner turmoil. There's also the assembly of a very impressive cast, all-be-it, a lot of them are wasted in thankless, underwritten roles. The likes of Bryan Cranston, Blythe Danner and William Petersen needn't have turned up at all, but James Caan lightens the mood whenever he's onscreen and the young unknowns get a chance to shine instead; particularly (the director's daughter) Betty Kaye, who develops a crush on her teacher and Sami Gayle as a young prostitute who develops a similar infatuation. The real star, though, is a brooding and commanding Brody. He's rarely offscreen for the entirety of the film and even though it's no surprise that he delivers his usual reliability, he's especially good with a very powerful and charismatic performance. However, the cast and the impressive handling of the material can't save the film from being overly depressing, or when drawing to it's conclusion, descending into melodrama from which it never fully recovers.\n Cut from the same cloth as the, Oscar nominated, Ryan Gosling movie \"Half Nelson\", director Tony Kaye delivers a good insight into the difficulties of teaching and the importance of instilling a good childhood and sense of self in our youth.\n\nMark Walker",

Well-received at film festivals, it's less liked by critics but has a solid 7.6 rating on imdb.\n\nIt's depressing as hell. Quite a cast for this type of movie...really names throughout. Still, it's the young and inexperienced Sami Gayle who really steals the show. At first, I thought she would just be another lame prostitute character. She really turned into a great, great, moving character. Really a top-notch performance.\n\nI can see why the critics don't like the movie for its \"wallow in dime-store despair,\" but there is a lot of truth to what is being said, even if the circumstances are a little shallow/overdone/cliche. Brody returns to prime form, finally, as a bleeding heart sub teacher. But there is a lot of truth in that character who is unhappy but tries to accept others. Not a fan of Lucy Liu, and her big scene I thought was going to be horrible, but she basically said what I was thinking earlier while watching the movie...it's easy to be callous. It takes character and courage to care. \n\nThere are a couple great scenes. Really, a lot of them involving Gayle are great, but especially near the end. She if she doesn't rip your heart to shreds. Then Brody's handling of the final traumatic event. There is a certain touching of the face that I thought was just damn perfect. So all-in-all, it's a helluva downer flick. If you look at it on the surface, maybe it's much ado about nothing.

I related to his fear of attachment, along with his deep desire for connection.  I related to his love for young people & his desire to help them in the short spans in which he could connect with their hearts.  I related to his sorrow at not being able to put a dent in the desperate need out there.  I related to the frustration with politics, \"the system\", apathy, bureaucracy, & wanting to be a fractionally significant heart beating in the midst of it.  His feeling of invisibility...yet deciding to overcome the past injustices, the present injustices, and make slight changes for the better.  I highly recommend this movie.  However, it will leave people sad, lonely & hopeless unless they realize that in the midst of the human despair & brokenness, our hope must be in God...and this film only focuses on the brokenness & one man's personal attempt to be a positive light in his small corner of the world.  God can shine much more brightly than one man on his own steam.",

Still suffering trauma after his mother suicide, Henry Barthes decides to lead a lonely life as a substitute teacher.  He refuses to connect with other people and their emotions as a form of self-defense. We capture him in one of the New York high schools where he started work as a temporary teacher. In a 3 weeks period we observe his boundaries losing up, letting others to have an impact upon his life, allowing himself to feel something more than usual numbness.

But this would really defeat the power of this film - which would suggest that such a need is due only to ubiquitous assimilation - the result of a marketing holocaust. Instead, in true existential fashion, Kaye propels us to look within ourselves - to understand the true nature of our own existence despise all the darkness that may be required to do so. What the film strives for is reality; to provide a very truthful and honost impression of society. The result is a very poetic and stylised impression of a group of characters trying to find their place within a carnivores society and a flawed existence. The film is not only darkness, however, - there are a lot of beautiful moments, particularly in Henry and Erica's character arcs - and the life that is breathed into them - at least momentarily (but are these moments not enough?) or the way the film turns to literature, poetry and art as an ultimate salvation.",

He spends his days conveniently avoiding any and all emotional connections by never staying anywhere long enough to form an relationship, in school and out. Then a new assignment places him at a public school with a frustrated, angst filled student body, neglected by their parents, and some of their teachers. Henry soon becomes a role model to these scary, disturbed kids. In finding an unlikely emotional connection to the students, teachers, and a runaway teen he takes in from the streets, Henry realizes that he's not alone in his life and death struggles to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world.\" To read the rest of this review, check out our site!! :) http://www.screensyndrome.com/review-detachment-2011/",

            "content": "I hope you do not detach yourself from my movie review of the drama \"Detachment\". But if you do, I punderstand I mean understand due to the numerous puns incorporated. \"Detachment\" stars Adrien Brody as Henry Barthes, a longtime substitute teacher who detaches himself from deep emotion due to a troubled past. Oh Henry! What could have happened? I will detach myself from revealing that because it does play a crucial factor in the film's narrative, and I do not want to spoil it for you. When he is transferred to another school, Henry's life begins to change due to the new people in his life. Henry befriends an attractive teacher colleague named Sarah Madison. A bullied female student named Meredith admires Henry due to his willingness to always help students in need. Henry also aids a young prostitute named Erica, and even allows her to stay in his place, with no sexual attachments required. Henry also constantly visits his ailing elderly grandfather. Henry is a good man. But when Meredith wants Henry to be a substitute of a father figure, and when Erica wants Henry to be a substitute of a lover figure, and when Grampa wants Henry to be a substitute of a savior figure, and when Ms. Madison falsely accuses Henry of being a substitute of a child molester figure, it puts Henry into a maximum stress level state. Director Tony Kaye, who also helmed \"American History X\", does more than an O Kaye job in presenting a story of a melancholy man trying to assist others while at the same time holding on to a dark past. Carl Lund's \"Detachment\" screenplay was a bit unorthodox but well-worded. Brody has not been this good in a starring role since his Oscar-winning turn in \"The Pianist\". Brody taught us a lesson that he can still act with his marvelous work as Henry! Yo Adrien, you did it! Christina Hendricks continues her rise to movie stardom with another well-rounded performance as Sarah Madison. Others in the supporting acting faculty that had passing grades included James Caan as veteran teacher Charles Seaboldt, Marcia Gay Harden as Principal Carol Dearden, Tim Blake Nelson as Mr. Wiatt, and Lucy Liu as Assistant Principal Dr. Doris Parker. Young actresses Sami Gayle who played Erica and Betty Kaye who played Meredith did show some promise with their performances, but still have to pass a few more tests to gain acting tenure. So my assignment for you is to go to your own personal homeroom and examine \"Detachment\". ****Good",

A GQ-suited Adrien Brody is good as the aforementioned sub, who doesn't care but actually REALLY does care about the lives of his temporary charges. I could have done without the boring is-he-or-isn't-he-a-molester grandpa subplot, but the film's central relationship between Brody's bummed-out teacher and an adolescent prostitute is surprisingly beguiling, given how hoary and cliche it is.\nBut too often, the small scattershot moments of emotional truth are bludgeoned to death by overreaching moments of near-comic travesty. (One teacher's wife won't even look at him when he comes home. Literally.) By the end, you'll be surprised there's only one suicide given how unspeakably terrible everyone's life is. A sad-teacher montage plays like an outtake from R.E.M.'s \"Everybody Hurts\" video shoot.\nI was actually surprised by how many good actors got sucked into this downbeat sulk-fest (is that Bryan Cranston as a toe-sucking WASP?).

The only part I really didn't get was when he takes in a teenage prostitute and tries to set her straight. Poor acting on the girls behalf, a little weak in the writing. Could have been cut. At one point Brody is addressing his students and gives a very moving monologue, which I found profound and deeply unsettling, in a good way. Overall it was a good movie and would recommend.",

            "content": "Detachment is a sharp, pessimistic drama which ultimately engages, but also depresses. Desperate, artistic and sometimes filled with anger, this movie depicts the problems within the American school system in much better way than the usual school sagas. It actually develops into a broader criticism of the whole society and at some point the comparisons with American History X become inevitable.\r\n\r\nHenry Barthes (Adrien Brody) is a gifted, but lonely teacher, who is completely devoted to his profession and assignments as a substitution teacher. He is sent to a public school, where lack of motivation, despair and frustration have created a poisonous school environment.  Barthes has the ability to engage and to captivate the attention of his students and soon he becomes a sort of role model for some of them, while he is facing further personal challenges. His life is a daily struggle against a non-working system, a system in which frustration and apathy have the central place. \r\n\r\nWhat Tony Kaye has achieved is the depiction of the non-working educational and social system in the US. Just like in his previous delivery American History X, he hits hard, not sparing the audience for a single moment. The whole pace is slow, filled with pessimism and anger about those abandoned children. The dramatic load in Detachment is surely  a result of the stunning leading performance of Adrien Brody, as well. His self-assured behavior, his ability and determination to find the strength to continue every day are performed in an unforgettable way and this becomes by no means Brody's best role since The Pianist.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, director Tony Kaye has shown that he knows how to successfully and convincingly  re-create the inconvenient reality. Unfortunately, the message in this movie is unclear, chaotic and based on idealism. There is no solution provided, even the criticism is as if it comes from an idealist: it's loud, it's emotional...but unclear. This feeling is strengthen by the \"too artistic\" approach taken by Kaye: the camera testimonials and the animated parts are appealing, but inefficient when it comes to conveying the whole message to the audience.\r\n\r\nDetachment is no doubt a drama to be seen. With incredible leading performance and a topic that hits hard in your face, you would be thinking about this movie long after its final credits.",

A truly realistic, heart-wrenching, and depressing film. The screenplay was written by Carl Lund, which is actually his first screenplay. I cannot wait to see what else this man will write, as this is one of the finest crafted scripts in quite some time. The story is brilliantly told, and flows in a perfect pace, with very powerful dialogue. The direction was done by Tony Kaye, who directed American History X, which in my opinion is one of the finest films ever made. Kaye directed this film quite stylistically, like he was wanting the cinematography to be well focused but having a feeling of being detached from everything. The film was led by an unflinching performance by Adrien Brody, who gives the second greatest performance of his career (just edging up behind his role in \"The Pianist\"), and it features a truly brilliant supporting cast consisting of Christina Hendricks, Marcia Gay Harden, William Peterson, and Betty Kaye (who is the daughter of the director). I just cannot get over how powerful this film is, and how realistic it is. I must say that it is unlike any film I have ever seen in my life. \r\n\r\nTo conclude this sloppy review, \"Detachment\" is unlike anything I have witnessed, it is a very true to life, passionate, and disturbing film by a very talented director. What makes it even more chilling is that it correctly portrays modern high-school life. I highly recommend to all. Thanks for reading.",

The characters feel real, the situations all too identifiable, and the feelings are all to easy to relate to. \n\nIt is Adrien Brody\u00e2(TM)s performance that elevates the film to such an effective and moving level. It\u00e2(TM)s certainly his best performance since The Pianist, he inhibits his role completely, conveying depression, emptiness, and regret with every expression, every gesture. His work is the most unforgettable part of the film. He gives the film its authenticity, it\u00e2(TM)s soul, it\u00e2(TM)s identify. \n\nThe supporting performances are also strong, and uniquely portrayed by each actor. The smart script helps, with a good blend of intelligently written dialogue, characterization, and commentary. The emphasis is not so much on the system itself, rather the individuals actors within that system, and the hopeless and tragic cycle that is simultaneously the cause and a symptom of it.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, it\u00e2(TM)s directed well, with good framing and a methodical pace. My only significant criticism of the film is the sometimes over-indulgent editing techniques, which sometimes distract from the scenes, with constant shifting.\n\nOverall, it\u00e2(TM)s a memorable, thought provoking, look at the educational system, society, and the internal struggles we all deal with. \n\n4/5 Stars",

I know not how it was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasureable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant eye-like windows--upon a few rank sedges--and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the bitter lapse into everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime.\" \n\u00e2\" Edgar Allan Poe (The Fall of the House of Usher and Other Tales )",

The movie most certainly had its moments, but on the whole the piece was overshadowed by some pretentiously cringe-worthy camera work and bleak writing. I feel it's a movie worth one viewing for the fun of seeing a plethora of familiar faces, the impressive acting talent of the two young girls, and in particular, one hilarious bit James Caan pulls toward the beginning of the film.",

A substitute teacher, Henry, is assigned to a high school where other teachers and staff feel completely helpless in controlling their students as well as the school itself. Henry has seemingly walked into a world that is crumbling around him. He's okay with that since he's spent most of his life being detached emotionally. Usually, if you're lucky enough, you have people in your life to teach you the complexities of the world and the people in it. Henry hasn't had anybody since his mother committed suicide. His grandfather is his only relative left and even he can't help Henry. His grandfather's mind is slowly going and eventually he'll be gone. Another reason for detachment when you know that you'll be alone.\n\nHenry is confronted with connections. A girl in his classroom who is as lonely as he, a runaway girl who prostitutes herself and a teacher who doesn't like being alone. It's up to him to connect with these three ladies, but he's so blocked emotionally that a connection to him would feel like a disillusioned folly. It's not easy since the pain of losing another person probably would be like being a drift in a sea of foreboding waters. You don't know what to expect in that isolation.\n\nThis film isn't exactly about the school system. It's partially about it, but leans more to the title of the film itself. It's not easy to get through since it's extremely depressing, but honest in it's depiction of a life prone to loss and self doubt and trying to detach yourself from all of that stuff. Even from the people who maybe feeling the same thing. An important movie.",

If they were they missed it by a mile.  I think the movie is realistic even if it was a little dramatized.  I went to school in an upscale suburb of Washington D.C. Kids committed suicide from time to time. They sold drugs, they bullied teachers, they started fires in trashcans.  There was a teen-aged prostitution ring.  I knew a 14-year-old pregnant with her second child.  And all of this was in an upscale town where new homes cost 500,000+ and people drove shiny new cars and worked for the government.  I started high school as an honor student.   All the crap in this movie is why I dropped out.   The teachers were sad people who walked on eggshells and were despised if they cared. I despised their lack of authority and the fact that students could get away with being antagonistic to the teachers and pretty much all else.  My  German class once bullied our teacher to the point of tears.  He gave up and left after that.  I feel like going back and apologizing to all the teachers I left that year.\n\nThis film made me think I might be okay with not having kids after all.  I mean, unless I move to a country where people naturally respect each other more and are generally driven to work hard and take their studies seriously, I don't know how I can prevent my kid from becoming exactly like me or worse.  I definitely couldn't blame them if they wanted to drop out.  Many countries allow students to enroll in trade schools at 14 or 16 and really, that's all I wanted. To learn something useful.  To be allowed to learn what I wanted.  I love to learn, but I did not love that four-year prison sentence they call high school.  Some of my classrooms didn't even have windows.",

Its perhaps a little like Dangerous Minds, only not so dramatic as such. Having been in education for many years, seeing how disinterested the numerous students were reminded me of situations I've seen myself. I liked that at times we (the viewer) are shown what appear to be drawings made out of chalk shown on old fashioned blackboards, drawings/images of birds taking flight, animals and so on. I suppose its to represent freedom and mobility (social mobility) perhaps.I thought that Adrien Brody did well portraying the substitute teacher, someone who can guess what may be behind some of his temporary pupils problems and issues but never having the time to be able to fully work with any of them, while we also see that he has his own emotional stresses in his own family life.This is a sad watch but its a good film.
