            "content": "(Jamie Fox, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Walton Goggins, James Remar, Don Johnson, Bruce Dern & Samuel L. Jackson)Set in the Wild West in Texas in 1858, a former dentist turned bounty hunter named Schultz stumbles upon the Speck Brothers who are in transit moving slaves they own. Schultz gets to talking with a slave named Django inquiring if he's heard of the Brittle brothers, upon affirmation of such information Schultz proceeds to purchase Django if he helps him locate and take care of the brothers than he would grant Django his freedom along with a horse and $75. Schultz then takes Django under his wing training him the ways of the bounty hunter and he becomes his deputy. After successfully tracking and taking out the Brittle Brothers and many other targets over the winter Django tells Schultz his story of how he and his wife attempted to escape their former owner and then were sold separately, and how he would like to use that reward to purchase his wife back. They discover the location of a Mississippi plantation where Broomhilda, his wife , was sold. They learn the ruthless Calvin Candie Von Shaft is the new owner and they now know that a scheme needs to be plotted to successfully purchase Broomhilda without raising suspicion that she was the target all along.For a nearly three hour movie it certainly doesn't feel that way as the film is so action packed that it'll keep you on your toes the entire duration of the film. A beautifully produced piece of film that stacks up with every other great Tarantino film, it just fits the mold so perfectly. Well developed characters and a unique story like none other. So much originality has been missing in westerns i feel like this one fueled the next decade of great westerns that have been released. This long list of actors in this film is quite extraordinary as there was even more great actors i could have listed. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and I'll admit i listen to this frequently it just fit the film perfect. The dialog was written so nicely creating some iconic scenes. Anyone who truly loves film can not get enough of this Tarantino masterpiece.",

            "content": "I just saw this film and I confess that I am completely satisfied. I am not an admirer of Tarantino but I have little to say about this film, inspired by a character from the sixties western-spaghetti films and mixing western with blacksploitation. Tarantino's style (exaggerated, showy, extravagant and excessive) is all there before us, but unlike other films I didn't feel that this was a problem or transformed the film into a kind of parody.The plot is about the search that Django, a former slave who is unexpectedly released and becomes a bounty hunter, will do for his wife, a slave who was sold and disappeared. He has the help of a German, responsible for his release. Together they discover that she is at the home of a rude slave-owner called Cotton Candy who, among other businesses, profits from death fights between slaves. So they decide to disguise themselves as experts in the field to go to his plantation and try to buy her freedom without Candy realizing what they want.The film is very good and, despite being almost three hours long, it has no dead moments and entertains wonderfully. However, although Tarantino's exaggerations and histrionic vision were not a problem this time, there are some points that were really uncomfortable, mainly concerning historical rigor, which, we already know, is not something that he really takes seriously (another reason why I don't like him as a director). To begin with, such Mandingo Fights never existed. We are not in Ancient Rome and the slave owners, however bad they were, did not like to throw money out the window and kill for pleasure their best pieces! Tarantino went to get that silly idea from another film he liked and pasted it here. Another problem is the use of dynamite, which would only be invented a few years after the period in which the film takes place. The clothes also do not match the time or place of the action. The outfit of the Club's black maid, with that miniskirt, is particularly bad in that it sexualizes the character and imports a 21st century scent into the middle of the 19th century. I will not go on much longer, I think I proved my point. Another thing I have to say is that this is a very violent film, Tarantino style, that is, with a ton of blood for each bullet, spectacular shootings, some nudity and high doses of brutality. The dialogues are also full of racist insults and profanity, but I think that was something the film asked for, in support of its own credibility. In short, this is not a movie for anyone. With Tarantino, this is often taken for granted.The main role was given to Jamie Foxx, and he is superb and gives the character a strength and toughness that I liked, and which contrast nicely with the polite sensitivity of Dr. Schultz, brilliantly played by Christopher Waltz. This actor had already done an extraordinary job in \"Inglorious Bastards\" and now he was even better, with a character that seems tailor-made for him. I was particularly impressed with the work of Leonardo Di Caprio, who rarely manages to make villains. He is an actor with a rare talent and has managed to be worthy of our contempt in this film. Another actor who shines in this film is the veteran Samuel L. Jackson, in the role of a black butler so fond of the owner that he becomes more slavish than whites. I also liked the brief cameo of honor of Franco Nero, the actor who played Django in the original films. It was an elegant and honorable way for Tarantino to bow to the actor and the work that inspired him. Much less impressive was the performance of Kerry Washington, who has little time and material to show what is worth.Technically, it is a film full of notable aspects that require our attention and that, to a large extent, are part of the director's brand image. It is the case of cinematography and the use of strong colors and slow motion footage in action scenes, features of a strong visual style that Tarantino loves. The sets are good, and also the costumes despite the anachronisms that I have mentioned. The film has a pleasant pace, but the first half was generally better yet more restrained: it seems that Tarantino gets lost in his own style as he approaches the most violent scenes. The soundtrack is great and takes advantage of several songs by various composers. Personally, I enjoyed listening to the original song from \"Django\" by Luis Bacalov, and the songs composed for this film by Ennio Morricone, a name that will always be associated, in collective memory, with the great western-spaghetti of the past. It was a careful, effective and honorable selection in the way it honors the genre.",

            "review_title": "Brutally hilarious and quite messy, but a total blast from start to finish",
            "content": "I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino's latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.What pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino \u2013 he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django's editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino's work up until now.But then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.Acting wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he's ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object \u2013 but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie's adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.Surprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django's shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. For all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst. 8/10.",

            "content": "After all the hype, all the articles and reviews, after all the controversy over the 'n' word, after all is said and done, Tarantino kicks butt again and comes up with a terrifically entertaining movie. Notice I said entertaining and not necessarily enjoyable. There are a number of scenes that are clearly not enjoyable, in fact, downright troubling like the dog attack of the black slave D'Artagnan (Ato Essandoh) and the hot box scene involving Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). But over all, Tarantino has fashioned a well told revenge tale modeled on the Spaghetti Western genre of the Seventies. And it begins immediately with a classy credit for the 'friendly participation of Franco Nero', the original coffin dragging gunslinger from the 1966 film who's name is resurrected here because frankly, it just sounds really cool.Now here's the problem I have with folks who find racism around every corner - when a movie depicts events or themes that have racism at it's core, it doesn't mean that the picture or the film maker is racist or is making a racist statement. The entire controversy in the media surrounding the use of the 'n' word here is a prime example of critiquing the movie as a racist film. Personally, whenever I heard it used in the picture, it sounded to me like part of the era's vernacular and not as a pretext for sensationalism. So here's a question I have for the critics - when will you put Jamie Foxx and Samuel L. Jackson on the spot for their participation in the project? Are they being racist, or are they artists? Or is it only Quentin who has to answer for the film's language and subject matter? What I didn't expect from the movie was the amount of humor and comedic dialog that came along with it. The bag head scene was surreally comic and just mind blowingly funny, but you really have to listen to the dialog to get it. The guy who was upset over the critique of his wife's working on the hoods was something one could easily relate to, and yet it sounded completely ludicrous even in context. I guess you have to be a little warped to come up with something like that, but warped seems to be right up Tarantino's alley. He proves it once and for all when he has Django blow himself sky high with the bag of dynamite. Priceless.As for the violence, well it's red meat bloody and about as visceral as it gets, so if you're on the squeamish side, there are a few scenes that may give you the heaves. It's one area where the director explicitly goes over the top and much of it is quite unbelievable. I have to admit though, the 'say goodbye' scene with Miss Lara Lee (Laura Cayouette) was the best, and it wasn't bloody at all. That was one of the times the picture entered 'Kill Bill' territory.As for a recommendation, you'll just have to guage your own preferences. I'm a Western movie and Tarantino fan and there was no way I was going to miss this. Casual movie goers with a low tolerance for gore and gratuitous shoot 'em up scenes should most likely stay away. Finally, for those hung up about the media's fascination with the 'n' word, I tried keeping up with the count as the picture progressed. I've read accounts that placed the number at well over a hundred, but I came up with seventy seven myself, realizing that I probably missed a few because it's easy to have your attention diverted by other elements in the story. No reason we can't get a recount with captioning on the DVD when it comes out.",

Tarantino defies the laws of film, he shoots them in his own way, however he wants. Tarantino has always focused upon the action thriller genre from Reservoir Dogs up until Inglourious Basterds. However, Django Unchained is Tarantino's first look at the Western genre, his first attempt at it and he executed it beautifully. The scenes were shot perfectly alongside an amazing soundtrack as well as his own small cameo.Django Unchained tells the story of Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is soon picked up by bounty hunter Dr King Shultz (Christoph Waltz). The story follows on as Shultz takes on Django as his \"deputy\" during their tasks of bounty hunting, in return Shultz says that after winter he will help find Django's lost wife, Broomhilda. This takes them to a huge plantation in Mississippi owned by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), from here they plan up a scheme on how to get away with Broombilda.The cast boast out amazing performances, particularly Christoph Waltz (also famous for his previous collaboration with Tarantino on Inglourious Bastards as Colonel Landa). Both Foxx and DiCaprio's performance are both equally amazing. All three are able to add some light-hearted humour in the mix to make sure it doesn't stay too serious, as well as having comic actor Jonah Hill play a member of the KKK.There's a reason the film has been nominated for 5 Oscars.",

Excessive profanity especially use the word 'nigger', check. Excessive violence including testicles getting blown off, check. Soulful musical score, check. Sometimes non-linear narrative, check. Shots of women's feet, check. Very great character driven plot, check. An actual spaghetti western, even though it takes place in the American South, check.There are four standout characters played by the top billed actors.Jamie Foxx plays Django, a freed slave who becomes a bounty hunter. Even though he is the titular character, he gets downplayed when in the presence of the other actors. Still he delivers a solid performance, in fact hes very convincing. We all know Jamie Foxx as this golden voice RnB singer and comedian with a very clean cut image. He was able to pull off the whole transitioning from a timid slave to a menacing bounty hunter. Not only that he had the whole look down too, with all the facial scarring and the messy hair.Christoph Waltz plays Dr. King Schulz, a German dentist turned bounty hunter who frees Django so he could help pursue his previous owners who are targets. Waltz is a very charismatic actor, and thats how he does this role. Presents every line with finesse.Leonardo Dicaprio is in his best yet. He plays a plantation owner, Calvin Candie, and is the owner of Django's wife. This is a very different role. We've seen Leonardo in gritty roles before but never did he play this lecherous antagonist. We were all used to Leo being this teen idol, who looked like a member of Hanson. Here he's this Southerner with discoloured teeth and a scruffy beard.Finally Samuel L. Jackson who plays Steve, a house slave who you could say is the secret antagonist here. For all the screen time that he has he dominates. Sam usually plays boisterous roles as a tough guy, but it was very interesting seeing him play a devious and manipulative old man.The only gripe here was that this film was a little too long exceeding the three act structure, but its an epic western film so I'll excuse Tarantino for that. Yet again he made another great film with a lot of flair and carried well by the four big hitter actors. Well done Mr. Tarantino.",

There is of course the over the top climatic ending and plenty of blood.I have to question the use of the MF bomb several times in this picture. The first know usage of the word is the 1930s.

After all, just about everyone knows that Quentin Tarantino's films are incredibly bloody, gross and self-indulgent. So, when you see a billion gallons of blood and bodies flying everywhere, you are not really surprised! This one does go a step further--there is some full-frontal male nudity and a few of the scenes were so gross and gratuitous that Tarantino has outdone himself. But still, you KNOW ahead of time that this is not a film to show your mother, Father Jenkins or your 6 year-old!! However, HOW far it goes will limit the film's appeal--you can be sure of that. Evan a large number of adults would be unable to stick with this one...it's THAT violent.The film is, in some ways, like an Italian western. I loved that much of the music was done by Ennio Merricone--the same guy who did music for such classic spaghetti westerns as \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" and \"Once Upon a Time in the West\". It was a major plus. I also liked seeing that one of the many wonderful cameos was by Franco Nero--the original Django. But, if you think that this is a modern Hollywood version of an Italian western, you are mistaken. PARTS of it are--most is not. In fact, despite the western clothing on so many of the characters (anachronistic, actually), the film is mostly set in the American South just before the Civil War. People just didn't dress that way at that time and in that place. The film is, at times, sort of like a blaxspoitation western in style as well.What did I like about the film? Well, it was never, ever dull. The film never really gives you a chance--even though it clocks in at 2 hours and 45 minutes. Second, as I mentioned above, there were a lot of cool cameos--and some were real surprises, such as Tom Wopat and Bruce Dern! Third, although it was vile, the language was dead on--no politically corrected phraseology in this one! Nasty and blunt, that's for sure. Fourth, although it was really violent and gross, I will admit that there is something very satisfying in seeing all these racist jerks killed so violently. It appeals to the lowest instinct in us...but on a primal level is IS appealing. Finally, the acting was quite good.What didn't I like? Well, even for a Tarantino film it was violent---very violent. Also, I definitely agree that the first hour or so of the film was MUCH better. It was better paced, less indulgent and more enjoyable. The film did become a bit of a free-for-all blood-fest near the end and the 'mandingo fighting scene' was unnecessarily nasty. Still, if you have the stomach for it, \"Django Unchained\" is a heck of an enjoyable film.By the way, I did a little research and there appears to be no such thing as 'mandingo fighting'. This was made up for this film.",

The opening of the movie though, was great, I was hooked instantly and the end was so chaotic and fast paced! I wasn't expecting this movie to be as hilarious as it was either, so many scenes had the timing of humour spot on and actually made me laugh out loud. The story isn't complicated or hard to follow which is good, I enjoyed being able to relax and watch the movie unfold. I like this...8/10",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's 8th film \"Django Unchained\" is one hell of a movie. A brutal, bloody, terrifying, hilarious and awe-inspiring western disguised as a buddy movie that is so great that if John Wayne and Sergio Leone were alive now, they would've approve of this movie. It's designed to shock you, polarize you, test you and maybe even surprise you. But let me clear on this: If you are not a fan of bloody violence and the running length of 165 minutes, see a shorter movie. But if you love to see what Tarantino can do with movies like this, then you're in for a treat. Set during slavery in 1858, the movie follows Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (The always reliable Christoph Waltz) who hires him as a bounty hunter and a free man to find the Brittle Brothers. After finding them and hunting them down at a plantation run by Big Daddy (a remarkable Don Johnson), they relax for the winter only for them to go on a mission to find and rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who runs a plantation known as Candieland. He even has a renegade slave as a servant named Stephen (A nearly recognizable Samuel L. Jackson, hidden in makeup and some prosthetics), who will have a part to play in the last half of the movie. I think Quentin Tarantino has outdone himself once again. Being in the filmmaking game for 20 years now, you can't deny and even reject his style in what he is bringing to the screen (He also has a cameo in here as well). His dialogue is like reading a book that grabs you and makes you want to know what happens next. The look and scope of the film is magnificent, thanks to a brilliant Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson and the late production designer J. Michael Riva. The performances in this film are brilliant. Having won an Oscar for \"Ray\", Jamie Foxx continues with his breathtaking performances that wows us. Here as Django, he is certainly fearless, baring his soul (and body) playing a man who is free from slavery, but can't be free by the rules and limitations of slavery. Christoph Waltz looks like he was born to be a part of Tarantino's entourage after his Oscar-winning performance for \"Inglorious Basterds\". Here, once again he brings humor and vulnerability to Dr. King Schultz. Never before have I ever seen an actor go that far and doesn't go over-the-top like Leonardo DiCaprio. As Calvin Candie, DiCaprio is certainly Oscar-worthy as a man who runs a tight ship by running a place where male slaves fight to the death and female slaves are being prostitutes and he seems to be the kind of guy to like even though he is a villain and he speaks Tarantino's dialogue like a pro. When he has a scene in which he reveals three dimples from a skull that belongs to his father, he is literally terrifying. Kerry Washington is superb as Broomhilda and Samuel L. Jackson is the real scene-stealer. The supporting cast is great from Walton Goggins, Jonah Hill, Michael Bacall, Michael Parks, James Remar, Robert Carradine to a small cameo by Franco Nero. \"Django Unchained\" has a lot of things to say about slavery and how cruel it is. But at the same time, it provides the fact that if Tarantino rearranged history by shooting Adolf Hitler to a pulp while everything blows up at a movie theater, he can do it again by having a former slave whipping a man who used to beat him and his wife. Now, that's entertainment. This movie really is off the chain. It's not only one of the most captivating films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year. Go see it, it will be worth your time. Keep in mind though, there are characters, especially Django, Stephen, Candie and Schultz that uses the N-word numerous times in this movie. That seems relevant to the time period, don't ya think?",

            "content": "Let me make it clear. I did enjoy most of it, but I also found myself looking at my watch and hoping it would end sooner. If there was a film this year that more than deserves the adjective excessive, this is it. It's a decent film, with plenty of action, some very funny scenes, and three of the best performances of the year: Jackson's house slave is almost as good as Washington's performance. He's an interesting and complex character, somehow who we can't even imagine existed. He's the darker twin of Scarlet's mammy in \"GWTW\", way darker and just as fascinating. There's of course, another star turn by De Caprio, puzzling, magnetic, depraved, and ruthless, and Waltz creates another memorable character, a foreigner who can't comprehend what's going on in his world, but who doesn't stop from taking advantage of the situation without losing his soul.\"Django\" is a hybrid of Westerns? and a very strange take on slavery, looking at it through Tarantino's special lens. He's unable to edit himself, and while he builds the tension and almost never loses our interest through Django and Schultz quest to rescue their \"lost princess\", I kept wondering why he overindulges all the time. Things don't clash here, they explode with such magnitude that I was wondering why wasn't 3-D involved in the process. I kept looking for guts flying and what happened to the NC-17 rating.There is much praise to give to the fact that he takes risks with his use of language, and there is not a boring conversation in the entire film, but when there is confrontation, you almost feel like ducking or you'll be hit by some of the flying organs. Much of the praise here should go to the way the Old West comes alive with the costumes and art direction. There is also the amazing job Robert Richardson does with his camera, making the film look and feel like one of those Spaghetti Westerns he's paying tribute to. I loved the way he brings in Franco (the original Django) and interacts with this movie's hero. There's of course, some Ennio Morricone, and a few other touches that show Tarantino's adoration of the genre.Is there a story? Well, barely. A lot of the film is about the feel of it, like getting on a ride without expecting much depth, and to be fair, there shouldn't be a IQ test or some confusing plot twist to ruin the entertainment, but I think Spielberg knew how to control himself in \"Saving Private Ryan\" by limiting the massacres to the first 20 minutes. A little restraint would have helped here. Who knows? Tarantino might have achieved his masterpiece.Another detail that is puzzling me. We're hearing all this praise for the movie, like it's the second coming of Peckinpah or the latest collaboration between Benton, Penn, and Carpenter. It's as much fun as the best '60's B movie, but I am not sure about those accolades out there. Where was all this praise for the \"Indiana Jones\" films? Maybe they should have included more flying body parts and some more colorful language? Still enjoy it for what it is... a ride that has plenty of movie syrup in it.",

The movie even got some heat in America for its violence (then again it also got some heat, because of its male lead. One party decided it wasn't a good example for white people to be killed by a black guy, the other side thought it was unfair in its depiction of black people and so forth)! Saying it lead to people becoming violent(?).Apart from those discussions, what can be said, is that Tarantino did it again. A great movie, with superb performances by everyone involved. Who'd have thought Kerry Washington would have to learn German for a role? Not me, but the inclusion of Waltz, Tarantino favorite and rightfully so, made this happen.

            "content": "Modern exploitation guru Quentin Tarantino serves up historical revenge once again. His last film, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, had the German Nazis getting theirs, and now, with a good German on board (in fact he's the villain from the last film) we're out to set things right in the American Deep South, two years shy of the Civil War\u0085 Although the first half takes place on the road from Texas to Mississippi as bounty hunting dentist Dr. King Schultz recruits a slave named Django to help him find three outlaw brothers (Django alone knows their appearance). These are the more spirited and deliciously cutthroat segments as our heroes partner up and, as Django puts it, \"Kill white people for money.\" Christoph Waltz (Schultz) and Jamie Foxx (Django) are a good team, and while making mince meat out of their targets, the bloodshed is something to marvel. But Tarantino throws in awkward bouts of humor, derailing the intensity of the moment. One particular scene where a group of rednecks complain about not seeing through masked eyeholes (including a very distracting cameo by Jonah Hill) feels like Mel Brooks clumsily intruding Sergio Leone.After Django helps Schultz with his job, it's time for the doctor to aid his more-than-capable partner rescue Django's wife Broomhilda, who resides at \"Candyland,\" an infamous Antebellum plantation run by the sinister though much too youthful Calvin Candie.While Leonardo DiCaprio has more than capable acting skills, and savors the gloriously tyrannical racist dialog, there could have/should have been a backstory on why the owner of a plantation looks fresh out of finishing school.For a man who's supposed to have a lifetime of seething venom oozing from his veins, those desperately piercing blue eyes seem more confused and frustrated than cold and calculating, making Tarantino's purposely overboard racism more of a crutch than weapon for the DiCaprio character (perhaps Don Johnson, who played a wily brothel owner in a previous scene, could have taken this role\u0085 he had the age going for him and with that, soulless eyes that look like he's seen \u2013 and been through \u2013 pretty much everything).But Leo's not alone. He's helped along by the most wicked of Uncle Tom's played by Samuel Jackson, whose spitefully cantankerous Stephen figures things out before his boss. This is a nice role for the QT stock actor, who has sleepwalked through many roles post PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN. Although his feeble mannerisms often slow down the performance.The main problem with UNCHAINED is how long Tarantino stretches scenes with dialog. While the actors, especially Waltz and DiCaprio, have a blast with colorful monologues, you'll often forget there are other characters on board \u2013 and most of the speeches fail to serve the plot. That being: the duo pretending to buy Mandingo slave fighters when they really want the girl.With all the deals and discussions going on, the much-anticipated reunion of Django and Broomhilda is lost in the mix. Not even Django's surreptitious trigger finger (whenever she's treated badly) adds worthy suspense, which, during this overlong stint at Candyland, is very much needed.But there's not all downtime at the mansion: a particular Candie lecture involving a slave's skull does successfully perk things up, providing DiCaprio a good five minutes of sheer unapologetic villainy. Then, after a shocking twist, it's Django alone who must save his girl.Jamie Foxx, having played a quietly brooding second fiddle to Waltz so far, makes up for lost time with heated gusto. This third and final act involving a group of Australians being duped by Django, who's learned the art of waxing poetic, is replete with the bare-knuckle action we've anticipated all along: although the large chunks of bloody guts flying off each gunshot victim seems like Tarantino doing an imitation of himself. There are some really neat montage sequences and beautiful locations, but some of the music, especially that of the rap nature, seems too modern for the time portrayed. And the editing feels somewhat limp without QT's longtime collaborator Sally Menke, who died a few years back: Particular flashbacks and hallucinations are often confusing and awkward.A pretty good ride, much better than Quentin's last two films (BASTERDS and DEATH PROOF), yet there needed a much tighter/sharper vehicle for our title hero to deserve the fanfare of the literally explosive finale.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",

            "content": "I'm fascinated by spaghetti westerns. How can Italian directors, many of whom never set foot on American soil, reinvent an entirely foreign genre, that of the Western? How can they take the basics of the John Wayne-style cowboy film and transform it into a world with no morality?All Italian Westerns owe a debt to the films of Sergio Leone. A Fistful of Dollars liberally borrows - steals - from Akita Kurosawa's Yojimbo. Its hero doesn't fight the two gangs in the film one on one in honor bound High Noon-style duels. Instead, Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name uses treachery and deceit to defeat both gangs, which depend on their terrorism of the populace to keep their position. Leone would move past simply remaking other films toward creating his own movies that were ripe for being ripped off.After Leone, arguably the best Italian Westerns came from Sergio Corbucci. The same director who'd go on to direct Bud Spencer and Terence Hill comedies like Super Fuzz was really known for some of the most brutal and violent films in the world, which is saying something, as the Italians do love their blood and gore.His main hero Django, who first appeared in 1966's Django. The character's name is a joke based on the guitarist Django Reinhardt's ability to play guitar despite not being able to use two of his fingers. In the film, the villains destroy Django's hands before he rises up to take them all out. According to Ruggero Deodato, the assistant director of the film, Corbucci also borrowed the idea of a protagonist who dragged a coffin filled with gold and weapons behind him from a comic book that he had read.There would be over thirty sequels to this film, many of which were completely unofficial and many of whom have nothing to do with Django at all, including One Damned Day at Dawn...Django Meets Sartana! Nero would only reprise the role once in 1987's Django Strikes Again, the only official sequel, which was produced with Corbucci's involvement.Throughout the films of Quentin Tarantino, the shadow of Sergio Corbucci looms. In his very first movie, Reservoir Dogs, the scene where Mr. Blonde slices the ear of Nash the cop is completely indebted to Hugo performing the same gory attack to Brother Johnathan. At the end of Kill Bill, Tarantino had a Rest In Peace notice for those actors and directors he saw as his most important influences: Charles Bronson, Lucio Fulci, Sergio Leone, Cheng Cheh, Lo Lieh, Lee Van Cleef, Willian Witney and, of course, Corbucci.Never has that influence been deeper than in this film, an indirect remake and remix of the Spaghetti Western, now back in American hands.In 2007, Tarantino said that he wanted to create a movie that dealt with America's sinful past, but not in a message movie. Instead, he wanted to make \"genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to.\" He went on to explain that after starting to write a book about Corbucci, he was intrigued by how his films offered an evil and horrible version of America.There are also allusions to the films Mandingo and the snow scenes of Corbucci's The Great Silence. Even the title itself alludes to the American title of another Corbucci film, Hercules Unchained.The movie begins in Texas in the middle of the 1800s. Ace and Dicky Speck (James Remar and James Russo) are driving black slaves on foot toward an unknown destination. One of them is Django (Jamie Foxx), who has been separated from his wife Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington), a house slave raised to speak German and English.Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German dentist/bounty hunter, soon arrives and offers to buy Django to gain his knowledge over three men he has a warrant to bring in dead or alive. Ace tries to shoot him, but Schultz easily kills him and shoots Dicky's horse, leaving him trapped and at the mercy of his now freed slaves.Schultz isn't another slaver. Instead, he offers Django a chance to be a free man and teaches him the career of being a bounty hunter. He's a natural - he's able to pull off incredibly complicated shots with all manner of weapons. As they track the Brittle brothers, they make their way to the plantation of Spencer \"Big Daddy\" Bennett (Don Johnson). While the two men talk, Django finds two of the brothers - Big John and Lil Raj - whipped a slave. As he remembers them doing the same to him, he flies into a rage and murders the two men. The third brother runs but is easily stopped by Schultz.Later that night, Bennett and the local Klan raid the campsite of our heroes, but a combination of poorly made hoods, explosives and skill allow Django and Schultz to escape. Afterward, Schultz relates the German tale of Siegfried and his epic rescue of Broomhilda. Realizing that he has at last met a real hero, Schultz feels honor-bound to help Django reunite with his wife.Some months later, Django and Schultz travel to Mississippi and the Candyland plantation, whose owner Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) now keeps Django's wife. Schultz and Django meet Calvin at a gentleman's club where he stages Mandingo fights and attempts to buy one of his fighters, which is all a ruse so that they may purchase Broomhilda.Over dinner, Schultz offers to buy her as his escort. This makes Calvin's loyal house slave Stephen (Samuel Jackson) suspicious, so the villain changes the deal so that they don't get the fighter, but only the woman. He thinks he's won, when truly our heroes have exactly what they've come for. However, he can't stop lording over Schultz and continually demands that they shake hands. A shootout ensues, with Schultz killing Calvin, Calvin's bodyguard Butch (also James Remar) killing Schultz and Django killing, well, everybody.However, our hero can't stop everybody and is captured, with Stephen forcing his surrender by threatening Broomhilda. Django is nearly castrated by Billy Crash before being sold to the Australian-owned LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, who will soon work him to death.Django soon turns the tables on the mining company's escorts, played by Tarantino, Michael Parks and John Jaratt (Mick Taylor from the Wolf Creek films). He returns to claim Broomhilda's freedom papers from Schultz's corpse, kills every single one of Calvin's slave trackers (Zoe Bell, Michael Bowen, Robert Carradine, Jake Garber, Ted Neeley, James Parks and Tom Savini play the trackers at various points in the film) and then enters Calvin's mansion, where he murders everyone else as they return from the funeral. He saves Stephen for last, shooting him in the kneecaps so that he can't escape the house exploding as our hero rides into the sunset with his wife, or as happens in The Ring of the Nibelung, they renounce the world of the gods and together, they hail light-bringing love and laughing death.Spike Lee said he would not see the film, saying, \"American slavery was not a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. It was a Holocaust. My ancestors are slaves stolen from Africa. I will honor them.\"Samuel Jackson again defended Tarantino, replying to Vogue Male that \"Django Unchained was a harder and more detailed exploration of what the slavery experience was than 12 Years a Slave, but director Steve McQueen is an artist and since he's respected for making supposedly art films, it's held in higher esteem than Django, because that was basically a blaxploitation movie.\"Since this is a Tarantino film, there are plenty of references to movies within and without the universe of his films. Django and his wife are meant to be the great-great-great-grandparents of the character John Shaft. And of course, Franco Nero shows up in a cameo role that made me raise my arms in triumph. When Tarantino first met him, he astonished the actor by knowing all of the dialogue and words to the songs from his films.There are also appearances by Dukes of Hazzard star Tom Wopat as U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum, Russ and Amber Tamblyn as Son of and Daughter of the Son of a Gunfighter, Bruce Dern, Jonah Hill and Lee Horsely - from The Sword and the Sorcerer - as Sherrif Gus.Happily, this film isn't the end of the story. A comic book sequel to the film, Django/Zorro, is supposedly going to be made into a film. Tarantino has also discussed plans to turn the movie into a longer mini-series, as well as a series of novels. One of those planned novels, Django In White Hell, eventually became The Hateful Eight.",

Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is a slave that speaks German.

            "content": "By incorporating a multitude of thematic Tarantino elements Django is the best Tarantino movie SINCE Pulp Fiction. Not as good as that great movie since this one is a little more bloated and less novel, it nonetheless is Tarantino's second best movie. This was great because it used many of the best aspects of the other Tarantino films. Such as the friendship between a black and white antihero (a hit-man like in Pulp Fiction but now the male bonding is as bounty hunters), also the violence art similar to Kill Bill and the Gut Warming, heart pounding, pulpy thrill of revenge against an evil like in Inglorious Bastards. There were many other aspects of Tarantino's movie in this one. To start off the complete unpredictability is what really draws you in. You really do not know what is going to happen next which is refreshing to those that frequently see movies. The episodic scenes have such a high degree of unpredictability that it mesmerizingly keeps us on the edge of our seats.There were some really amazing characters created which was not wholly due to the writer/director but the great actors who infused their talent into the roles. These characters' eccentricities were so unique that you might have never seen characters like this before. A trademark oddity in how they spoke, what they said and their ultimate actions reflected without any creative barriers the moviemaker's soul. If you thought Christopher Waltzes and Jamie Foxx's character were great wait till you get to DiCaprios and Samuel L Jacksons. You really wanted to see more of these characters despite the nearly 3 hour length of this Tarantino epic. Dicaprio's character was probably the best; he was so amusing with his warped, semi-depraved, megalomaniac eccentricity. DiCaprios acting was really good here too. Samuel L Jackson can blurt out the necessary profanities with the appropriate rawness making him the perfect actor for some of Tarantino's parts.The greatest thing is the psychological aspects to these characters and how that plays out in the scenes. There is actually a lot of psychology going on which builds multi-dimensional characters and creates scenes of intense unpredictability. There were other scenes of brilliant hilarity mocking the dark side of the old south, or genre film itself. As the movie progressed and where it could have ended well and uniquely alas a contrived scene was thrown in to showcase Tarantino's signature brand of violence art, reminiscent of Kill Bill. This weakened the movie as a whole and made it drag however it was pure fun to witness the slow motion blood splattering and detailed depiction of body parts being shot with blood shooting out like geysers drenching the place in red.I think I heard Tarantino is criticized for rehashing old movies or copying from other films. I guarantee whether or not that is the case you've never seen something like this before.",

            "review_title": "Tarantino At the Top of His Game",
            "content": "Django Unchained (2012) **** (out of 4)Quentin Tarantino returns to full glory in this violent homage to the various Spaghetti Westerns that he grew up watching. Former slave Django (Jamie Foxx) is bought by bounty hunter Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and in exchange for his help in tracking down three wanted brothers, Schultz promises to give him his freedom. Things then change when Django decides to go find his wife (Kerry Washington) who is being held by the notorious Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). I was one of the few who didn't care too much about Tarantino's previous film but DJANGO UNCHAINED has him returning to full glory. This film is funny, intense, violent, at times shocking but most important is that it's flat-out great entertainment from start to finish. If one is easily offended then there's a lot here to get upset about but it seems people often forget that Tarantino makes exploitation movies, which means he takes a serious subject and exploits it for entertainment. All sorts of violent sub-genres came up during the 70s glory days of exploitation and I think mixing the Spaghetti Western with a slave story works on many levels. The biggest being that the film manages to shock you but you also hate what's going on so much that you can't help but get behind Django and his cause. Foxx really did a remarkable job here and perfectly captured those gunslingers who said very little but did their talking with a gun. Waltz and his comic timing are downright terrific and he really adds a perfect balance to what Foxx does. DiCaprio is also excellent in the role of the sadistic Southern gentleman and I'm sure Oscar-time will be friendly. Don Johnson also does a great job with his small but flashy role and the debate on the masks is a brilliant example of comedy. The film really does a remarkable job at being a Tarantino film. Meaning that everything a fan has come to expect from one of his movies is on full display and perfectly executed. The music score is fabulous, the cinematography highly impressive and the costumes and settings really make you feel as if you're in the actual period that the film is set. DJANGO UNCHAINED isn't going to be for everyone but then again, what exploitation film is? The film is very dark, very bloody but oh so funny. It works on all levels including a terrific adventure picture with a bloody good revenge tale.",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's antebellum western \"Django Unchained\" is far more palatable than his appalling World War II epic \"Inglourious Basterds.\" Nevertheless, Tarantino adopts a tongue-in-cheek attitude toward 'the peculiar institution,' while he sets a new record for the number of times the politically incorrect N-word is used. The saving grace of \"Django Unchained\" is nobody behaves as clownishly as Brad Pitt did in \"Inglourious Basterds.\" Meaning, aside from its gratuitously-violent, revenge-fueled narrative, \"Django Unchained\" qualifies as a fair to middling horse opera that pays greater tribute to Fred Williamson's Blaxploitation westerns than Sergio Corbucci's Spaghetti westerns. Tarantino depicts southern plantation owners contemptuously as sadistic stooges along with anybody who conspires with them--whatever their pigmentation. Few surprises occur during its marathon 165-minutes. The absence of Tarantino's long-time editor Sally Menke, who died in 2010 from heat stroke, may account for this meandering melodrama. The first hour should have been seriously trimmed, but it provides you with adequate opportunities to contend with super-sized soda drinks. Sadly, \"Django Unchained\" generates little excitement until Leonardo DiCaprio enlivens things with his presence. He makes his character's obsession with phrenology appear frightening genuine. You know that he is a villain because he smokes too much. Tarantino stages one long, blood-splattered shoot-out that looks like a homage to \"Saving Private Ryan.\" This kind of exaggerated violence will make the squeamish cower. Conversely, gore hounds will admire the abundant use of exploding computer-generated body parts.A German dentist who masquerades as a bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christopher Waltz), purchases a woebegone slave, Django (Jamie Fox of \"Miami Vice\"), from a pair of shotgun-wielding slave traders. Schultz kills one slaver, shoots the other slaver's horse so the fallen animal traps its' rider, and then releases the other slaves so they have their way with the pinned slaver. Schultz has been searching for Django. It seems Schultz wants to collect the bounty on the Brittle Brothers. Trouble is Schultz has never laid eyes on the Brittles so he wouldn't recognize the three of them if he saw them. He buys Django so the African-American can spot them for him. After they track the Brittles down to Big Daddy's plantation and kill them, Schultz makes Django his partner. They arouse comments wherever they go because Django rides a horse. Whites weren't accustomed to seeing a black man astride a horse. Meantime, Django perfects his speed and accuracy with a six-gun until he can draw, fire, and hit the bull's eye it in one fluid motion. He tells Schultz about his slave wife and resolves to be reunited with her. Schultz traces Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) to a plantation called Candieland. Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio of \"Titanic\") owns Candieland and enjoys gambling on his African American Mandingo wrestlers. Schultz and Django pose as buyers searching for a good Mandingo fighter to buy. They are willing to pay $12-thousand for one of Candie's fighters. Candie invites them to his plantation. Along the way, our heroes watch Candie punish one of his runaway slaves. He turns several dogs loose on the unfortunate slave and the dogs tear him apart. Afterward, everything goes as planned for our heroes until Candie's oldest servant, head house slave Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson of \"Pulp Fiction\"), suspects the two aren't interested in slave fighters as much as they are in Broomhilda. At that point, all Hades breaks loose with shooting and killing galore.Little of this so-called tribute to Spaghetti westerns resembles a Spaghetti western. Indeed, Tarantino didn't lens the action in either Spain or Italy, and only rarely does the scenery look as spectacular as the scenery in a European western. Basically, three things qualify this as a Spaghetti western tribute film. First, original \"Django\" star Franco Nero makes a cameo in the second hour where he assures our African-American hero that he knows the D in Django is silent. Second, Tarantino appropriates music from several Spaghetti westerns, not only \"Django,\" but also \"Day of Anger\" and \"They Call Me Trinity.\" Purists will also recognize music from the Clint Eastwood western \"Two Mules from Sister Sara\" and the Rock Hudson World War II movie \"Hornets Nest.\" Third, Tarantino tries to imitate the popular zooms that were rampant during the 1970s. Incidentally, the zooms in \"Django Unchained\" barely resemble those zooms from long shots to close-ups so prevalent in Continental westerns and crime thrillers. Comparatively, few Spaghetti westerns were as gory as \"Django Unchained.\" The big plantation shoot-out looks like something derived from Sam Peckinpah's \"The Wild Bunch.\" Instead, \"Django Unchained\" looks more like a Blaxploitation western along the lines of the 1972 Fred Williamson western \"The Legend of N***er Charley.\" The cast for the most part acquit themselves admirably. Not surprisingly, Tarantino hasn't learned yet that his talents remain behind the camera rather than in front of it. Cast as an African-American slave turned bounty hunter, Jamie Fox maintains a straight face throughout the action, and Christopher Waltz oozes ingratiating charm as the older hero who teaches the younger hero how to be heroic. This is a standard-issue plot line in westerns. On the other hand, Leonardo DiCaprio virtually chews the scenery as plantation owner Calvin Candie. Samuel L. Jackson lands the juiciest role as a suspicious Uncle Tom house slave who has Calvin's ear. Tarantino's dialogue seemed on the weak side, too. Nothing here struck me as remotely quotable. This time around Tarantino employs lots of familiar faces, but few are featured in primary roles. If you look closely, you'll recognize Bruce Dern, Tom Wopat, Michael Parks, Robert Carradine, and Lee Horsley in minor supporting roles. \"Miami Vice\" star Don Johnson and \"Breaking Away\" lead Dennis Christopher get more screen time than their colleagues from yesteryear. The only really funny scene involves Big Daddy's vigilantes as they struggle to see through their crudely cut-out white bags that they wear over their heads. Altogether, considering the wealth of material Tarantino appropriated, \"Django Unchained\" amounts to a missed opportunity.",

            "content": "Django Unchained is a Western film that is thematically about revenge against slavery and racism. The film clearly understands how terrible this condition is, thus it gets interesting to that point. Since this is a Quentin Tarantino film, he never abandons his own style. Just like any of his films, it is brilliant in craft, gives a set of memorable characters charmed by the performances, and a high entertainment quality. The journey is quite enjoyable, though towards the end it disappointingly creates a misstep but it's all good anyway. Django Unchained hasn't beat Tarantino's best but it still can be memorable and undeniably enthralling.Any movie fan, especially of course Quentin Tarantino's fans, would definitely love the experience. The most obvious reason is his pure cinematic style. There's violence, great characters, and classic filmmaking. It's easy enough to get satisfied by those. The storytelling is pretty much of a Western story can be. The film takes a serious theme that keeps the plot intriguing. It sets an uneasy context and displays the violence of those times. At the point when Schultz first reacts at Django's whip marks and the depiction of that cruel history, there's a sense that the film might go extraordinary than just another cinematic pleasure. Disappointingly, the final act suddenly transforms the whole movie into an insane sweet revenge story. It seems like it's suppose to be a fan service or it's trying to be faithful to the Western genre, but it's random from all that was set up on the first two acts. It's not bad. It's just random. Again, it's still enjoyable but it could have been better and much compelling.The performances are as fun as a Tarantino film could ask. Jamie Foxx convincingly shows the personality, swagger, and the pathos inside of Django which is great enough to the character. Christoph Waltz once again steals the show. Mostly because his character gets to do more things than Django. Waltz is just being Waltz but his performance still shines as he brings charm to the character. Leonardo DiCaprio stands out, not only because it's an unusual performance from him but he also manages to hide the unknown sinister behind the villain's awkward charisma.The filmmaking is, without a doubt, stunning. The direction shows off many styles and impressive shots. The script is witty and makes the entire film entertaining. Even from the very first sequence, you already get the sense of fascination on what's happening. The production design is classy enough to make things look good. The cinematography is indeed perfect for a Western film, and the music score fits to every scene. Everyone will definitely find the action exciting even if the bloody violence may look too splashy.Django Unchained is a spectacular cinema despite of its mistakes. At least it never avoids portraying the ugliness of the setting. The dazzling styles can't even gloss that over. There is still something missing in the end which is sort of difficult to forget, but all the strange fun, humor, and intrigue will always grip you throughout the experience. The filmmaking and the performances are already remarkable to be fascinated. It's a near masterpiece. If only it was less ridiculous and less forced at the third act. Though, this flaw isn't really that bad. In fact, it's probably one of the best looking flaws you'll see. No one could make a flaw this good like Tarantino. Overall, it has plenty of memorably great moments and achievements that indicates that the film is still amazing.",

I haven't seen so many geysers since I was last at Yellowstone. I was taken in by the story. The establishment that there is evil out there and yes, there was racism in the old West. And I did enjoy the avenging angel. But when the gore started and it sounded like the lake washing up on the shore at midnight, I slipped away. I really didn't care what happened to these guys. This is just another one of those blood baths that have no end. Two hours and thirty minutes of it. They mistreated your wife. Let's kill everybody. Of course, they are all simplistically portrayed as consummate evil. Only Django and his guy are acceptable. And anyone else who is black, unless, of course, he's in it with the white guys. There are some things to recommend this. The cinematography rivals the National Geographic as they make their way through some of the most beautiful places on earth. The white house at the end of a path that looks strangely sexual is a good touch. The argument among the Klan members about the holes in their masks it hilarious. I know he is trying to pull our chain at every step and it is fun to see the bad guys get theirs. It's so excessive.I think what frightens me is what kind of culture have we become where this kind of movie brings people in in droves.",

            "content": "Beyond the name and a cameo by Franco Nero, the story here has nothing in common with the original film series being referenced, although the genre and the design do of course have a lot of common ground. The story here sees a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter freeing a slave who can identify three men who have a considerable bounty on their heads. Despite being an one-time deal, the partnership works so well that the two stay together for more work, although the slave (Django) only has one overall goal \u2013 to find his wife and buy her freedom.The film opens with all the tropes that tell you that this will be an exploitation-style western; the music is of its time, the credits are blood red in that wonderfully gaudy manner and the camera movement is knowing but effective, and indeed this is what we get from the film as a whole \u2013 a bloody exploitation western that refers the grindhouse films that Tarantino idolizes so much. However to suggest that this is all the film does is to somehow miss the fact that it does so much more. Despite being trashy in some regards, it is brutally unsettling in others \u2013 some scenes of cruelty to slaves are very hard to stomach. On top of this we have the usual dialogue scenes that Tarantino is very good at \u2013 just like Inglorious Bastards had some incredibly tense scenes of just talking, Django has many great dialogue scenes \u2013 some are conversations with a bubbling tension, others are monologues delivered to camera in such a way that you are gripped by what the character is saying. Then we have the other thing Tarantino \u2013 sudden bloody violence, and it is very bloody here \u2013 excessive, OTT and very well executed. And just in case this mix isn't convoluted enough, the film also takes the time to have plenty to laugh at whether it is the flamboyantly written characters or the comedy set-pieces which include a clan raid having wardrobe issues. It really shouldn't work \u2013 I have seen other films trying to do several things in the same film and not make it work but yet here it does, and remarkably so.Credit to Tarantino because he really doesn't put a foot wrong here (aside from casting himself when he can't act). He delivers a great exploitation film that, much like Inglorious, allows the audience this bloody fantasy retribution with the underdog hero, but also has scenes of genuine tension, scenes of great dialogue and others of genuine hilarity \u2013 and most importantly none of them seem out of place. The length of the film put me off a bit because the cinema releases ahead of awards ceremonies all seem to run long as if that counts in their favor \u2013 but in the case of Django the time really flew. It helps that it is really well filmed too; the camera movement is powerful, the shot selection good and With such material to work the cast all give great performances \u2013 again despite so many of them having different aspects to deliver on. Waltz is a great presence, as he was in Inglorious \u2013 he fits the dialogue really well and captivates with his colorful character. Surprising to me was how much I liked Foxx \u2013 he downplayed when he needed to but yet was also able to step up into the exploitation hero when required. Di Caprio captures real smiling menace and again I was surprised by how well he did it. Samuel L Jackson isn't in the film till the final hour or so, but when he arrives he joins a very crowded screen of people all commanding attention \u2013 but his house slave is brilliantly loathsome and convinces as a man so long surviving that he has forgotten this is what he is doing. Washington has less time but she sells the emotional part of the film by being so convincingly brutalized. The supporting cast is almost too heavy in famous faces, but mostly they do not distract but rather add with their various turns.I was taken by surprised by how much I enjoyed this film and how the time flew. It mixes so much together that should clash and damage itself, but yet it all works really well (even the mixing of genre music and modern hip-hop!). I'm not always a fan of Tarantino's grind house and exploitation referencing, but here it works really well across the board.",

            "content": "I enjoyed this action/comedy movie because I hated the evil doers and wanted to see them die because of their brutal natures. I reveled in their pain. And that's the problem.I'm going along about half way on this one because the performances are as good as they are and I can appreciate Quentin Tarantino's collegial sense of humor. Two \"Django's\" shaking hands. Brunhilde and Siegfried coming out of nowhere. A musical score that is an homage to Ennio Morricone. The surprises that pop out of a man's mouth or his sleeve.Tarantino's earlier stuff was pretty good -- \"Reservoir Dogs\", \"Pulp Fiction\" -- and \"Jackie Brown\" was finely written and directed, a very nice piece of work. The \"Kill Bills\" was far too stylized for me.\"Inglourious Basterds\" was a disappointment. It was much more violent than anything else he's done, and instead of comic internal conflicts, he'd chosen as villains the Nazis, the most evil people of the century, and their torture and murder could be endorsed without chagrin by the least sophisticated of us, the kind who think \"Don't just kill the enemy; torture them before killing them.\" It was a kind of pornography for the millions.He's followed the same course here and I didn't like it much. Given the depraved character of the slave-owning Southerners, no punishment is too harsh, so Django can kill helpless and unarmed people -- including women -- at will. As a hero, the character of Django is not just flawed but practically turned inside out. Superman was a hero Roy Rogers was a hero. Django was a walking abattoir, savagely killing everyone he disliked -- and Tarantino has provided him with a the simple-minded excuse of hating that \"peculiar institution.\" I don't want him as my hero. He's too Old Testament for me.The performances are good, though, and the production values high. Jamie Foxx has about two notes on his instrument but Christoph Waltz does a great job as the German bounty hunter. His accent doesn't sound German at all. It sounds like it came from somewhere in outer space. And Don Johnson is surprisingly chipper and colorful as Big Daddy, the plantation owner who gets splashily offed by Django's powerful rifle. (The squibbs seem to have had double charges.) Tarantino obviously has a lot of talent and a keen sense of humor. I wish he'd get back to his roots and lay off the easy targets.",

            "content": "This film is not recommended.The D is silent in Quentino Tarantino's blood-soaked film, Django Unchained, and so will you be, sitting there in the movie theater watching endless scenes of carnage and slaughter that co-mingles with the blaxploitation genre in this revisionist Western tale of revenge.\u00a0 At the core of all this bloodshed and violence are the historic issues of slavery and racism, but Tarantino uses a spaghetti western format to hone in on his underlying message. Racial stereotypes, offensive white characters, and ethnic slurs abound. But so does action and dark humor, minus the wit, in this brutal parody of the Old West.Django Unchained is essentially a tale of vengeance and black empowerment, told by the talented Tarantino. But with all his Black Like Me posturing, \u00a0the director takes over the role of the angry white man speaking for the entire African-American race. It all seems a bit ludicrous and egotistical to lessen the horror of racism as a vehicle for pop entertainment. That said, Django Unchained is an extremely well-made film worthy of the attention from the more seriously-minded faction of adult film-goers, but its outlandish plot and excessive treatment of violence kept the movie too absurd for me to truly appreciate. ( I may come off as self-righteous but I do tend to over-react and worry when the abhorrent subject of slavery parades itself as pop entertainment for a younger generation, muddying the historical content to become a pale substitute for their only possible history lesson on that issue.\u00a0 Fiction can so willingly become fact these days. I also question the R-rating slapped onto this blood-fest when a NC-17 rating is more befitting, with all the endless shootings, stabbings, and bludgeoning going on under the guise of vigilante justice in this film. ) After an hour's worth of slow-moving episodic detours and sub-plots involving repetitive shoot-em-ups, the film finally settles down to its main storyline, which is at least compelling:\u00a0 A slave, Django ( Jamie Foxx ), searches for his wife, Broomhilda ( Kerry Washington ) who is now the property of an wealthy plantation owner, Calvin Candies ( Leonardo DiCaprio ). On his journey for salvation, Django befriends a bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz ( Christoph Waltz ), and both continue on their rescue mission to Candyland ( the plantation's ironic name ). Now Tarantino has used this same set-up before in his previous films, a series of misadventures until the final climactic shoot-out takes place. It's his calling card. His solid filmmaking techniques and edgy style stays evident throughout his lengthy film. So does his gift for well-written conversations and flamboyant characters.\u00a0 But his screenplay needs more reworking to streamlining his film's potent message and there is in dire need of eliminating unnecessary complications within its plot structure.Beside his ever-present trademark non-stop gratuitous violence, Tarantino's anachronistic blending of pop, hip-hop and rap songs, along with modern sounding jargon, sharply contrasts the visual images on display with mixed results. He overdoes the pop culture references this time around. The excessive use of the N-word ( estimated usage: nearly 100 times, without exaggeration ) seems to be here more for its shock value purposes that authenticity and richness in dialog.Where the director / writer achieves success is in his wisely assembled ensemble of actors for their overly ripe roles.\u00a0 Waltz brings to his role a commanding presence and larger-than-life bravado. Washington creates a gripping portrait of a woman caught in a desperate struggle for freedom.\u00a0 Also on hand in a small supporting role is a Tarantino favorite, Samuel L. Jackson, giving another ballsy performance as a morally corrupt man servant.\u00a0 However, it is the film's evil villain that makes Django Unchained break free of its caricatural qualities. As Calvin Candies ( a.k.a. Simon LaGree channeling Snidely Whiplash ), DiCaprio is a guilty pleasure. The actor puts his underused comic talents to good service and astutely navigates a difficult role to great acclaim, creating such an indelible reprehensible scoundrel.\u00a0 Yet, what throws the film slightly off-balance is Foxx in the title role.\u00a0 The actor looks the part, but, strangely, seems too reserved and solemn for this empowered hero. Foxx does little to circumvent the subtle demands of this complex character.\u00a0 He becomes a stock character, The Man with No Game.The film rambles on, with too many side stories that do little to advance the action. More judicious editing is needed which would also help pick up the film's lackadaisical pacing. As the case with most Tarantino films, scenes go on far too long to build tension that has already been established.\u00a0 Humor seems sparse or sophomoric as set pieces drone on with no real purpose.Django Unchained is a live-action cartoon with an adult perceptiveness. Tarantino's films always have a divisive effect and this latest venture is no different. His re-boot of the Western for today's movie-going audiences will thrill only his die-hard fans and alienate others. Yes, dear moviegoers, there is plenty of red for your hard-earned green this holiday season, and its name is Django Unchained.\u00a0 And, yes, while the D may remain silent, it can also stands for disappointing as well.

Lately, with all of the senseless murders and on-going anarchy happening in America, this film could easily become the poster child for the N.R.A. and its recent stance against gun control and Hollywood filmmakers in general.\u00a0 Tarantino may not want his film to be seen in this light, but this film ( and many of his other movies ) could become a painted target for the Conservative Right mentality and close-minded gun enthusiasts with which to take aim.",

Schultz tells Django to pick out whatever he likes. Django looks at the smiling white man in disbelief. You're gonna let me pick out my own clothes? Django can't believe it. The following shot delivered one of the biggest laughs from the audience I watched the film with.

It's a great little scene that provides humor and allows the viewer to further warm up to the two main protagonists. But it also does more than that.

            "content": "Django Unchained (2012)(A second take at the bottom after seeing it again six months later.)What a wild, imaginative, provocative, beautiful, disturbing, excessive, nuanced movie.Is it a masterpiece? Maybe. Or yes, absolutely, as long as you can stomach some of the bloody mayhem. In terms of the core qualities of any \"great\" movie there is no argument here. The story is well told, filled with turns, believable in a fictional way, and entertaining. The acting is superb (or at times incredible). The photography and lighting and editing--the visual basics--are all excellent. The sound and soundtrack (including odd and wonderfully varied anachronistic popular songs) take you by surprise with their validity.The movie is overtly original in that Quentin Tarantino way that is firmly rooted in classic movie-making. It refers to older styles openly, including the ridiculously bold red lettering of the opening credits which are a little like the orange-red lettering of the first widescreen color movies in the mid 1950s. The music at times invokes spaghetti westerns, and the broad landscapes echo that (and in fact the cowboy theme takes us very close to these 1960s movies which Tarantino so loves).So, yes, this is a great movie in all these ways.Can you address the content more directly here? Is this movie about morality, about slavery and justice, about love and walking through fires to achieve it? Yes, of course it is all these things. But, many ask, does it tell the right story about these things? The first answer is, who cares? The director can say what he likes, right? Well, maybe maybe not. He can, of course, but he has to face the music of his critics because in fact movies are not just about cameras and storytelling conventions. They take on meaning, they move people to think, they cause palpable reactions.And so I'll come to the defense of the movie in the simplest ways. First of all, the ambiguity of the main character, the white bounty hunter played by Christoph Walz, is balanced and provocative and without real judgement. He's a cold blooded killer on the path of righteous judgement, a kind of John Brown revolutionary with a hankering for wealth, which he never gets to spend. Likewise the other lead, the black slave played by Jamie Foxx, is both victim and filled with bloody vengeance. It isn't automatically easy to justify everything, but it makes sense on some level, too.I realized when it was all done that the movie pulls off something I hadn't quite seen before--the real horrors of slavery. I think Tarantino \"gets away\" with it because his style is so exaggerated and unreal. The hyper-fable approach makes it possible to be comic and horrifying. If a movie just went ahead with a straight on with torture and brutality to show how bad slavery was, almost like a documentary, it would be unbearable, almost unforgivable. But here we see the worst kind of injustices as part of an approach that at other times forces you out of total verisimilitude, and you cringe and hate it but you go with the flow. Don't mistake things. This is one bloody cruel movie. To make people blow up with more guts and blood than usual so that it's like a comic book death does not make it less bloody. Blood will soak some scenes like graffiti art. And sound effects are used with amazing clarity to emphasize aspects like people's guts flying through the air--or, in a totally opposite way, to hear the searing sound of the ash on a cigarette as someone takes a puff. It's that kind of up and down, deeply thoughtful movie.See it? Of course, if you can stand a little over-the-top violence. It's morally sound, it's exciting and funny and fun and moving. It's beautiful. It's comparable in many ways, formally and in terms of content, to \"Inglourious Basterds.\" If you liked that, you'll like this. I thought it amazing through and through. Masterpiece? Why not?Second take: I had a slightly less overwhelming impression this time. It's still a masterpiece of filmmaking, for sure, but some of Tarantino's decisions--what kind of bloody excess, how much to say derogatory words, how to push and pull the plot--seemed slightly contrived. As if his style was forced on the movie, rather than used to further something within the movie. I also watched Inglourious Basterds again recently, and found I still am perfectly amazed by that movie. For now, it's the better of the two (and they have a lot in common structurally, and thematically). Anyway, the rest of what I felt goes. Especially the necessary revulsion. Necessary. A terrific movie.",

            "content": "In hindsight, given how extensively he had been \"inspired\" (read copiously pilfered) from it in his previous 7 films, it seems somewhat surprising to me how it took Quentin Tarantino 20 years to make his own pastiche-cum-tribute to the Spaghetti Western. Rather than the taciturn Leone/Eastwood hero \"The Man With No Name\", he picks the sub-genre's second best-known icon to do so \u2013 which is just as well since he subverts him into a caustic smart-ass of a colored slave, thus enabling Tarantino to hit two birds with one stone and equally pay would-be homage to such infamous exploitation fare as GOODBYE UNCLE TOM (1971) and MANDINGO (1975). Where it does ape Leone's celebrated Western quintet is in the sheer time it takes to tell its simple tale of revenge (165 minutes as of this sitting) but there have already been rumors circulating that a lot of footage was left on the cutting room floor after The Weinsteins vetoed Tarantino's desire to release the film in two parts! As if wishing to stress the fact that his version of the critically much-maligned (if clearly beloved of film buffs) sub-genre is superior to and artistically more valid than its antecedents, he takes great pains to point out that his is a \"Southern\" (set in America's Deep South, y'see) and not just a mere Western. Such earnestness to be taken seriously would have carried far more weight if we were not subjected to so much cartoonish violence (with the fakest use of blood squibs imaginable) throughout the entire film! Carrying on from his previous movies, however, we find a typically excellent ensemble cast at work here with Christoph Waltz, Leonardo Di Caprio and especially Samuel L. Jackson and Don Johnson (seriously) shining the brightest. Just like any number of the film's blood-soaked corpses, it is also riddled with knowing cameos, from Franco Nero to Bruce Dern \u2013 most of whom, buried as they are under whiskers and the ravages of time, went by unnoticed (Robert Carradine, Lee Horsley, Ted Neeley, Michael Parks, Don Stroud, Russ Tamblyn and Tom Wopat); unfortunately, the egocentric film-maker does not even spare us from a bloated, middle-aged appearance of himself as a mining company employee sporting arguably the worst Aussie accent on record!The central couple of Django and Broomhilde Von Shaft (yeah, the ancestor of Detective John Shaft, dig it?) are competently enough played by Jamie Foxx and Kerry Washington but it is very evident (particularly in the film's tastelessly upbeat final scenes) that Tarantino had Will Smith in mind when he wrote the screenplay; besides, the clearly Homeric (or rather Sigfriedian, given her Germanic name) overtones intended for Django's long-winded quest would have been far more relevant had Washington been made to be Mississippi landowner Di Caprio's mistress rather than just a kitchen maid!! Their past lives, then, are intermittently displayed via a series of rather pointless and gratuitously flashy flashbacks. Frankly, however, (whatever our personal feelings towards the man himself might be) we do not keep on going to watch Tarantino's films for their pointed character studies but to see how they fare in the \"coolly quotable dialogue\" and \"clevery obscure in-jokes\" departments: even though there are predictably reams of dialogue here, on a first viewing only a handful register as memorable at all (chiefly among them the brief exchange between Foxx and Nero on the spelling of the \"Django\" name; another one between Di Caprio and Jackson regarding Washington's German heritage; and the animated rendition of Jackson's colorful insults usually hurled towards Foxx; Waltz's ludicrous conclusion that \"Alexandre Dumas was black\" is best forgotten, however). Telllingly, the film's highlight is not an action set-piece but a subdued confrontation between Di Caprio and Foxx on their way to the latter's lavish abode Candyland. What is worse is that the film is oddly repetitive in both dialogue (some words keep cropping up\u0085and not just the dreaded \"N\" word) and action (Di Caprio gets his comeuppance exactly in the same way as a sheriff did earlier in the movie!); Jackson's explosive end, then, seems like an impersonal one given how despicable he had been toward Django, his wife and their own race!! Finally, the film is marked by some significant changes in Tarantino's personnel, namely producer Lawrence Bender and his late editor Sally Menke; it is a shame, however, that he did not also dispense with the services of The RZA (courtesy of some ill-judged rap rants) on the soundtrack \u2013 which, includes the title track of the obscure 1971 Spaghetti Western HIS NAME WAS KING (used here as the theme tune of Waltz's character) and a rather blah new song composed by Ennio Morricone himself! For the record, DJANGO UNCHAINED has been named Best Film Of The Year by The American Film Institute, is up for 5 Golden Globes (but the winners will only be announced in tomorrow's ceremony) and has just been nominated for another 5 Academy awards (but, surprisingly enough, both Tarantino and Di Caprio have been snubbed)!",

The mixture is gratuitous violence, popular concepts of \"just revenge\" and butchering of history and the importance of historical fact. Jews killing Nazis in \"Inglorious...\" Black man killing whites in \"Django...\" Tarantino is a torture-porn specialist, hiding behind badly disguised ridicule of the magnitude of human suffering in historical dramas like the Holocaust or the issue of slavery in America.

DiCaprio was like i've never seen him before, and being one of my favorite actors, it was a little weird at first.

Also, that there are massive issues regarding all kinds of credibility. Which leaves the two main problems with this adolescent mess. The first is: what would you say about any film centered on two races of people, in which one race is, with a single exception, shown to be nothing but a vast collection of savage, cruel, stupid buffoons? That's what QT happily does to the white race in this, his attack on racism.

            "content": "I do believe it goes without saying that Quentin Tarantino is without question one of, if not, the finest film maker of the past 20 plus years. His latest effort, Django Unchained does many things but chief among these being, it solidifies Tarantino's place as a great, GREAT film maker. His unique style of fantastic specifically worded dialogue and impeccably perfect scenes is undoubtedly his trademark along with unusual yet perfectly used soundtracks.Django Unchained has every single element of a perfect Tarantino movie with the added pleasure of being done almost better than he has ever done before. Pulp Fiction is without question his calling card film and it has since become a piece of Hollywood lore and for good reason. That being said Django Unchained may go down at some point as Tarantino's greatest film.This is the story of Django a slave in the south 2 years before the eruption of the Civil War. Django is soon acquired and given his freedom by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz played to perfection by the always entertaining Christoph Waltz who is quickly becoming Tarantino's muse much like a Scorsese/ De Niro type relationship, which I would say was one not many people got sick of. When King Shultz asks for Django's help hunting down his 3 former slave owners he quickly discovers Django's knack for the bounty hunting game. After agreeing to help King Shultz hunt criminals through the winter and teach him what he knows Django soon finds the help of Shultz to help him find his wife and bring her into freedom with him. After they discover her new owner is the prominently rich plantation own Calvin Candie they form an elaborate scheme to acquire Django's wife, Broomhilda.With absolutely expert story telling, Tarantino manages to get Oscar caliber performances from every major principal in the film, from star Jamie Foxx to a short lived character of Big Daddy played by Don Johnson.Django is Tarantino literally at the peak of his craft. With several elements from other films from rarely seen westerns to his own films such as Reservoir Dogs. Django is a very much stripped down effort from him but it never feels like it is lacking in any aspect of the film. With not one camera angle out of place or one song that doesn't feel perfectly used. Tarantino has a cast assembled that has the chemistry and feel already that you can imagine no one else playing every single role. He has masterfully directed every aspect and while Inglorious Basterds was the film that was thought to be his opus prior to release, it is clear Django Unchained simply will blow and cinephile away and casual fan of westerns and/or action will be enthralled. It should be noted the violence can be extreme and even leave a jaw open once or twice much like he did with his Kill Bill films, but this will in no way be it's defining mark at all.With several recent Golden Globe nominations by the Hollywood Foreign Press, who has always shown him great love, there is no doubt Django Unchained is a serious contender in every category and will be so once the Oscar nods come out in a few weeks.This may be his year. He has a best screenplay Oscar on his mantle already but it may have some company and more than one as well. Loveyourmovies.com",

            "content": "Tarantino's first western film sees him return with a lot of the usual Hallmarks that are associated with him as an auteur. This film is heavy on violence with lots of gunplay and fighting, and it is filled with plenty of dialogue which drives the story as much as the action. Like some of his other films there is also a theme of vengeance running through it, something that was explored a little in \"Inglourious Basterds\" by Shosanna and the American-Jewish commandos; in \"Death Proof\" by the surviving women; sort of in \"Jackie Brown\", \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Reservoir Dogs\" too. This time out though, the main vengeance is between a freed slave and slavers in the 1850's wild west.Christoph Waltz plays Dentist/Bounty Hunter Dr King Schultz, who frees a slave called Django (Jamie Foxx), who will help him find some outlaws he has been tracking for a bounty. Django has his own plans though and wants vengeance against the racial injustices that are rife, and primarily to find his wife Broomhilda von Shaft. They learn that she is being held as a slave at the Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) \"Candyland\" plantation in Mississippi. On route to Mississippi, Django learns all about bounty hunting from working with Schultz and they develop a mutual respect for one and other.Although Jamie Foxx was not the first name out of the hat when Tarantino went into casting, he delivers a great performance as Django. As his story arc develops, he gives the role some excellent character and strength which I liked, which contrasted nicely with Waltz's more polite and sensitive character. Django and Schultz have a good chemistry that works well in tandem, one being gritty and raw, and the other being quieter and more reserved. One being about action now, and the other being more of a planner. Both manage to learn from each other as the story progresses and, in a sense, this becomes a bit of a buddy road trip (on horseback) film. In Tarantino's last film \"Inglourious Basterds\" I felt that Waltz's performance was one of the standouts, and this film he continues that level of acting once more. I do not prefer one of the roles over the other, they are both equally on par here.The pantomime villain of the film is DiCaprio's Calvin Candie. On the surface a well-mannered southern gentleman, despite obviously being a slaver and dictator in his own kingdom. This performance caught me off guard slightly and the usual lovable DiCaprio was able to turn on the offensive as easy as turning on a light switch. One minute he was being presented as calm and jovial, the next minute displaying a mean as hell psychopath willing to risk everything. Tarantino had wanted to work with DiCaprio for a while, even try to get him for a role in \"Inglourious Basterds\", so in \"Django Unchained\" he finally got his man.I must mention Samuel L. Jackson's performance in this, he was incredible. He made my skin crawl and was a genuinely haunting character. He felt as much a bad guy as Calvin Candie was. In learning to survive and the way he adapted to do so for a better lifestyle he become corrupted. This corruption was not just the way he was and acted, but also the way he looked, his mannerism, everything about the performance gave me shudders.Dealing with a film that looks at a dark time in humanities history is always going to invoke ill feelings and this certainly does that. Tarantino's film here is of course highly stylized and not entirely historically accurate in certain parts, but the main topic of slavery is something that cannot be denied. While \"Mandingo\" fights might not be accurate, or the wardrobe being display is not always correct for its time, the atrocity of slavery did of course exist and was mainstream in certain parts of America. While Tarantino handles this topic, and the linguistics unabashedly, certain audiences and critics did not respond well to it. While some audiences and critics have said it is offensive to them and handles racial issues terribly, equally the film has received praise from some quarters for the way it authentically handled these things. In this sense, the film does and will divide perceptions and will not make everybody happy or comfortable. In his own justification, Tarantino wanted to do a film which featured the history that America is ashamed to deal with, and which other countries directors feel they do not have a right to deal with.This highly stylized western film is tribute to Spaghetti Westerns of the 1960's and 1970's, three of which Tarantino openly admitted he paid homage to in making \"Django Unchained\". Sergio Corbucci's 1966 \"Django\" and his 1968 \"The Great Silence\", and Richard Fleischer's 1975 \"Mandingo. The \"Unchained\" part of the title may pay tribute to the likes of Corbucci's 1966 \"Hercules Unchained\", or Lee Madden's 1970's \"Angel Unchained\" which is a revenge film against rednecks. Lots of doffs of the cap to Corbucci but then when Tarantino wrote this film he had just finished a book on Corbucci overlap isn't all that surprising. Furthermore, Corbucci makes a cameo in the film too, which further shows Tarantino's admiration for the Italian filmmaker.I enjoyed this film more than I though I was going to. After \"Inglourious Basterds\" I expected another visually strong film, but one which was a bit messy and unintelligent. In this I got an exciting film that despite its nearly 3-hour runtime it did not feel like it dragged and still offered plenty of twists and turns. It might not have handled certain racial elements well, and I cannot think it did anything for gender politics either the way that women appear only as damsels in distress. But none the less it offered good writing with lots of strong dialogue. The onscreen bromance between Foxx and Waltz was endearing and fun, and DiCaprio's character gave me a somebody to \"boo\" and \"hiss\" at. Add to the writing and the performances some lovely cinematography and well-choreographed scenes, and this film does feel like a modern spaghetti western that is full of grit and style. 8 out of 10.",

Every one who is killed is \"a bad guy\", but the \"good guys\" are also bad guys, in that they revel in the suffering of others (not just the deaths by the way). The difference is only in the backstory, character focus, and degree of sadism. This blurs moral lines in horrible ways, and tempts you into taking satisfaction and joy, not just in victory, but in human suffering.This is some sick stuff, and I am going to wait until QT stops making revenge movies, before I revisit his movies. They have lost all real human emotional qualities and all sense of moral compass. And BTW, its not that this film grossed me out, its that the main character had a real thing for blood and pain, and that was treated as just and right, not as an emotional curse/burden.",

This film is a combination of spaghetti western and blaxploitation. I know I am odds with others, but I don't find hearing the \"N\" word at least 100 times entertaining; watching two men fight to the death as \"entertainment\" (the hammer used to kill one of the two wrestlers); the murder of a black man by a pack of vicious dogs; constant whipping, etc., etc., etc. - and with all that said, my least favorite character, by far, was Django - he's supposed to be \"hip\" and manly and blah blah blah, but he's really just a despicable macho jerk. I was very disappointed by Leonardo Di Caprio's performance (I didn't see the last 40 minutes of the movie; I had enough of the constant violence).I get that others just love guns, violence, the \"N\" word, and find it oh so funny when the Klu Klux Klan can't see through their sheets (hilarious - not!) - I get that others just love violence against others. Let's see: Aurora, Newtown, Columbine, drone planes murdering innocent children, women and men in countries we are not at war with - hmmm - could there be a connection? A society in love with violence can't quite reconcile the kharmic blowback that inevitably occurs.Yes, this film is well-photographed; there is one interesting performance (Christoph Waltz); the music, while weird, has its moments - but that's it as far as I'm concerned.Tarantino is always infuriating. If he could get away from his adolescent revenge violent fantasies he clearly has a knowledge of film history and has the money to hire fine movie technicians.

Certainly individual directors, actors and producers like to be involved in something which is a little less like selling your arse to the highest bidder, but when the chips are down making a mountain of moolah, and then some, is the name of the game. That is the only way I can explain the abysmal, insulting mess that is Django Unchained.If you thought Inglourious Basterds - whose USP was the existence of a vastly successful Jewish death squad sticking it to the Nazis in occupied France - was as bad as I did, Django Unchained won't persuade you that Tarantino has regained his touch. In fact, with notable exceptions, for example Jackie Brown, you find yourself wondering whether he actually did have a touch in the first place and whether perhaps it was more beginner's luck.Tarantino's latest, I read somewhere, is a paean to B movies, and from the cheesy music to the the sudden close-up zoom he uses you can see that the man did, perhaps, have something like that in mind. So the obvious question is: why on earth bother? Is a meal of greasy, second-rate badly cooked food any better if you declare it is a paean to fast food? Why on earth did Christoph Waltz, Leonardo Di Caprio, Morgan Freeman and Jamie Foxx allow themselves to become involved in these campest of drearily camp capers? What was Tarantino trying to do? I ask because it really isn't obvious.At times his film comes across as a comedy (although the scene of the Ku Klux Klan complaining that they can't see where they are going because the eyeholes cut out of the white bags they are wearing won't let them is about as funny as a wet day in Dudley. Oh, and the Klan weren't even founded until seven years after the events of this film are said to take place. That kind of sloppiness permeates the film. There's also an inexplicable scene set in bright sunshine although we are supposed to be in winter, and the previous and subsequent scenes show deep, deep snow. And where did those snow-capped mountains come from in Texas?).The first hour is reasonably intriguing but then the decline sets in and the final scene is so ludicrously bad, you forget that earlier the film had to a certain extent held your interest, if only out of some vague curiosity as to where it was all heading.The blood flows with abandon, of course, and although it is gratuitous, it is no worse than other films (for example, a scene in The Cabin In The Woods). But not for the first time I have wondered about Tarantino's sexual psyche: he does seem to emphasise pain and gore a great deal. Is that perhaps how he gets his sexual jollies? But what the hell. This film will probably clear up at the box office because there is a sufficient number of idiots out there who are willing to sit through dross like this. But my advice to anyone who considering giving this a whirl is: don't bother.This so far has an average rating of 8.7. Don't let that fool you. It is terrible.",

Particularly when the Director/Writer is so young and with relatively few films on his resume.There is pressure on Mr. Tarantino to feed the descriptor, or none whatsoever when he makes films to amuse solely himself. The latter is the primary issue with the spaghetti-western-cum racist-tome direct from the Antebellum South, \"Django Unchained.\"One expects the liberal use of blood squibs in a Tarantino, and \"Django...\" will not disappoint. (Tarantino's famed over-length as well.) What's missing in \"Django...\" is the cleverness and surprise in previous efforts: \"Reservoir Dogs,\" \"Pulp Fiction,\" and the lyrical \"Kill Bills.\" The re-imaging of the War film so brilliantly accomplished in \"Inglorious Basterds\" makes the identically conceived \"Django...\" a self-parody of Tarantino. Just move the action back about ninety years and from France to America. Even place a scene using a foreign language as a way to speak openly in case eavesdroppers are within earshot. Hire the same pivotal character. Add the same cartoonish elements. And deliver the blood. This time add a few more laughs. (Slavery is far funnier a topic than the slaughter of millions of Jews.)As a writer, Mr. Tarantino's pen is running out of fresh ink. That the important issue of racism (and his favorite motivation - revenge) is the spine of \"Django Untamed\" does not excuse this film is merely a number of scenes tossed ascreen that do not make a convincing, complete film. Mr. Tarantino is listening to the hype and lost (at least with \"Django...\") the ability to tell a good story without requiring the audience to hold what's dear to Tarantino to their breasts as well. Spaghetti westerns are a cheap genre from long ago that were mostly awful - save a few starring Eastwood. The corollary follows: \"Django...\" is a conceit by a man venerating crap. The result is crap. And that's insulting to an audience. (Using titles from other films as illustrative of the genre for his current film is also becoming an annoyance.)The story in a nutshell: 1858, slave and wife are branded then separated when they are sold. Waltz, a Bounty Hunter, finds slave to help him track down some baddies. Slave becomes adept at Bounty Hunting and he and Waltz conspire to save slave's wife from another plantation owner. Then Shosanna runs a Parisian movie theater and hatches a plot to kill all the important Nazis.Samuel L Jackson is terrific as the self-loathing Black Slave Supervisor nastier than any White. (And whiter as well.)Jamie Foxx is a comatose-robot-killing-machine with a fast gun and little depth. (No wonder bigger Black stars turned this role down. Probably due to embarrassment at the portrayal of Blacks.) Watlz' sympathetic-to-slaves 180 turn from Hans Landa in \"Inglorious Basterds\" is serviceable yet will certainly garner another Oscar.DiCaprio chews not only the scenery but some furniture as well. It's a fun turn but not enough to save the film.Tarantino populates smaller roles with TV faves from formative years when his nose was three inches from a Philco. (Casting these has-beens also saves a lot of dough.) \"Django Unchained\" is rife with lots and lots of padding and self-indulgence galore. A few more films like this and Tarantino will be the Director of whom it is asked, \"Hey, whatever happened to that guy who made those really bloody movies? He used to be good.\"",

            "content": "I'll get to the heart of the matter. \"Reservoir Dogs\" was spot on. It was a realistic (in terms of the outcome) yet highly stylized gangster film. It said to the viewer, \"I know you are expecting X, Y, and Z, but isn't it time you 'grew up' already? Do you want to see the same movie over and over again?\" 'Bad guys' do bad things and usually self-destruct in one way or another at a young age. We saw that no matter how hard one might try, you cannot polish a turd, as they say.Despite the cute dialogue, these guys are bad, do bad things, and the results are bad. If that heist would have 'succeeded,' they just would have gotten themselves killed or jailed some other way. it was a 'wake up call,' an inversion, or perhaps the best way to think of it is that it wasn't what it seemed to be. It was just a bunch of 'simulacra' thrown together to resemble a feature-length film. It succeeded brilliantly, but Tarantino had nowhere to go after that, other than to stylize and fabricate as much as possible, creating ludicrous, absurd movies that had no point. If you saw one you didn't need to see another.\"Django Unchained\" is more of a postscript. It's not as ridiculous or as historically inaccurate as it could have been, but even it if had been, what would it have mattered? He's been there and done that, and apparently can't figure out what to do now other than to repeat the past. He is in the \"Woody Allen Zone\" at this point (just substitute the \"white,\" rich, self-absorbed complainers for retro and homicidal, yet more \"diverse\" and colorful characters in Tarantino's last several films), in my opinion, meaning that he's \"mailing it in\" for the money. The movie is too long and very quickly the viewer can predict the kinds of things that will transpire. I don't play violent video games (or any video games at all), but after watching this I was thinking that it would be much more interesting in every way to just do that; after perhaps twenty minutes (or less) I'd get my fill of this sort of thing and could use the other two hours and change to do something \"productive.\"The following is my highly speculative, \"inside the mind\" history (or is it an anti-history) of Tarantino's \"MO:\" After \"Reservoir Dogs,\" he had one last idea, essentially the end of the \"Hollywood Blockbuster\" disguised as a Hollywood Blockbuster (an anti-Hollywood Blockbuster?). It would be a highly stylized, very violent move that would appear to have several compelling \"back stories.\" The reality is that it had none, and once the viewer figures this out, he or she should tell himself/herself that there is no reason to watch such films any longer, other than as some sort of \"cheap chill,\" basically \"violence porn.\" That blockbuster, of course, was \"Pulp Fiction.\"The title \"gave away\" the director's thoughts: \"stop watching my films if you are an intelligent, empathetic person.\" Of course you may have watched one or two more because you couldn't be sure, but at this point his movies are some sort of \"post-modern,\" anti-film, non-story. Watch them, expecting something different, and as they say, the joke is on you. Instead, I suggest you consider taking a course on the history of film, film criticism, or something along those lines. Seeing \"Django\" is like being the \"best\" guest at a \"dinner for schmucks.\" So, I guess the most interesting question now is, what do we make of a reviewer who realizes what is occurring yet still feels compelled to watch these anti-films in order to tell others not to be the butt of a joke? Is this an anti-review? A \"pulp\" review?",

            "content": "Like Inglorious Basterds, this is another juvenile cartoon by the perennially adolescent Tarantino. However this time he manages to make it a racist cartoon, as well. How is it racist? Tarantino plays out a macho fantasy game by featuring a strong though implausible African American protagonist and yet spreads the N-word liberally throughout the film. He's defended that particularly odious over-usage by suggesting that being \"authentic\" to the times demanded it. And yet much of the film's details are otherwise incorrect: the rifles are wrong for the time period, for example; and the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of rap, old pop (Jim Croce?) and music from other films. And most obviously, the racial attitudes of both white and African Americans are simply ludicrous. The taunting, insolent attitude by Django towards white people would never have been tolerated in the South, circa 1858. And certainly no Mississippi plantation owner would allow him at the dinner table with white guests. Tarantino has also led many to believe--dishonestly, this is his version of an Italian western. However, it hews closer to a sub-genre of Seventies Blaxploitation--Westerns (Buck and The Preacher, Take A Hard Ride and very obviously The Legend of N---- Charley and its sequel The Soul of N---- Charley, to name a few.) Of course there are the standard QT touches in the film: odd flashes of humor, odder cameos (Michael Parks, Lee Horsley, Don Johnson, father and daughter Russ and Amber Tamblyn) and over-the-top violence--although even the violence is handled ineptly. The gushing blood shots look more like exploding balloons over-inflated with red paint. QT hasn't lost his touch with actors and he gets good performances from his leads--Waltz, Foxx and especially DiCaprio. Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of the African American house crew gives a masterly performance reeking of evil. But all of it comes in service to a trashy, overlong and digressive film. Tarantino is over-due for a course in films not marketed to 13 year old comic book readers or grindhouse fans. Until he shows an adult perspective I think I'll forgo any more of his films.",

            "content": "Django Unchained presents the larger-than-life tale of a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who collaborates with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz)\u2014a German dentist-turn-bounty hunter\u2014in order to rescue his wife from the servitude of a ruthless Mississippi plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). The story begins in the US state of Texas in the year 1858\u2014two years prior to the start of the American Civil War. The tone of the movie is set by Luis Enriquez Bacalov's original \"Django Theme Song\" sung by Rocky Roberts\u2014taken as it is from Sergio Cobucci's Django (1966)\u2014which plays with the opening credits. Django Unchained is Tarantino's tribute to the visionaries of Western filmmaking\u2014those who conceptualized the decorated genre and more so those who prevented it from dying by reinventing it. The Western genre has always fascinated Tarantino. Right from the beginning of his career it has been his dream to make a Western of his own. Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci are the two filmmakers who seem to have inspired him the most. With Django Unchained, Tarantino finally seems to be living his lifelong dream of emulating his childhood idol. And what makes Django Unchained even more special is the fact that it comes at a time when the Western genre once again finds itself on the brink of obsolescence.While the classic works of John Ford and Howard Hawkes epitomize the golden age of Western filmmaking, the grotesque, tongue-in-cheeky works of Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci\u2014often referred to as Italo-Western or more prominently as Spaghetti Western\u2014clearly represent its new age. At a time when Western genre was looked upon by most filmmakers as dead and buried, Leone and Corbucci not only rejuvenated it but also changed its very face for the better. The Old West which was once governed by the tenets of pride, honor, chivalry, machismo and idealism got metamorphosed into a brutal realm inhabited by realistic, grey-shaded characters that despite their endless flaws couldn't be deemed completely devoid of human virtues. While Leone is often regarded as the master creator of Spaghetti Western cinema, people often overlook the indelible contribution made by Corbucci. With movies like Django (1966) and The Great Silence (1968), Corbucci succeeded in adding a whole new dimension to the Spaghetti Western canvas by painting a nightmarish world haunted by fascist ideologies. In fact, Corbucci's depiction of the Old West was so lurid, stark, brutal and vicious that it made Leone's portrayal appear remarkably dull and placid in comparison.There's absolutely no doubt whatsoever that with Django Unchained Quentin Tarantino consummates his trademark style\u2014built around the uncanny combination of gore, glamour, grotesquerie, and dark humor\u2014which is often described using the adjective \"Tarantinoesque\". The movie's filming style also bears a striking similarity to Sergio Corbucci's sanguinary, majestic Spaghetti Western masterpiece: The Great Silence (1968). In Django Unchained, Tarantino fiddles with history (but falls short of rewriting it unlike his previous film Inglourious Basterds) to present his own perspective on several delicate issues mainly concerning slavery. Tarantino's naked display of uncorroborated brutalities associated with the inhumane practice of slavery, especially Mandingo as its extension has given rise to discontent among certain sections of the white community. Likewise, the movie has received condemnation from the likes of Spike Lee and Tavis Smiley for glorifying the n-word in the tradition of blaxploitation films. Django Unchained features special appearances from Jonah Hill, Don Johnson, Quentin Tarantino and Franco Nero who had played the titular role in the 1966 Spaghetti Western classic Django. Tarantino's imaginative direction is well backed up by some commendable acting performances from movie's lead as well as supporting cast. Jamie Foxx delivers his best performance in years, one that is perhaps bettered only by his Oscar-winning portrayal in Ray (2004). Despite bearing several similarities to his multi-lingual part in Inglorious Basterds, Christoph Waltz portrayal easily forms the backbone of the movie. Tarantino once again takes full advantage of Waltz's polyglot abilities and uses it to great effect at different points in the film. Waltz's Schultz is basically a representation of all those white men who raised their voice against slavery and contributed to its abolition. Behind his facade of a cold-blooded bounty hunter we discover a righteous human being whose superior intellect is well matched by his great sense of compassion. He inexorable resolve to rescue Broomhilda and his sacrifice in the end inexplicably brings to mind of the great sacrifice made by Abraham Lincoln. Schultz is a symbol of white men's conscience, courage and virtue in the same way as Samuel L. Jackson's Stephen is a symbol of Black men's pusillanimity, servility and hypocrisy. Thus, Stephen in many ways is Waltz's antithesis and the movie's true antagonist. And to Jackson's credit, he plays the part with great subtlety, guile and conviction. According to this critic, it's his best performance since Pulp Fiction (1994). Leonardo DiCaprio, in a rare negative portrayal, delivers a thumping performance as the sadistic Calvin Candie. A megalomaniac who dresses with the perfection of a fop, Candie is quite easily one of the most menacing Western villains of all time. Kerry Washington plays the part of the slave-girl Broomhilda\u2014the only major female part in the movie\u2014with exquisite charm.Overall, Django Unchained has its flaws and suffers from anachronisms and incongruities, some deliberate and some not so. But, Tarantino still manages to pack a strong punch. From the cinematic point of view, Django Unchained is undoubtedly a lesser work in comparison to Inglourious Basterds (2009). But the audacious yet effective manner in which Django Unchained retraces the history, fiddles with it, and presents its dark side makes it an important work of cinema. Django Unchained is unusually high on style, but luckily there's enough substance to keep an intelligent viewer interested. Highly recommended!A more detailed review of the movie can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",

            "content": "One thing that you can always guarantee with a Tarantino film is hype. The film will often be a financial success before it's even been made, ending up as the usual bloodbath featuring naughty language. This time out, with 'Django Unchained', Tarantino takes his hand to the Spaghetti Western, using his usual brand of cinematic homage and borrowing.Now, as you may have guessed, I'm not much of a Tarantino fan. There's something about his films, and the man himself, that just irritates me. While his films are generally entertaining gibberish, I've always been left a little annoyed by them. I did enjoy 'Pulp Fiction' and Inglorious Basterds', but on the whole, his films just don't really do it for me.As with 'Inglorious Basterds' before it, 'Django Unchained' was always going to come amid a wave a controversy. This time Jewish revenge against the Nazis is replaced African-American revenge against their white slave owners. With the main talking point about the film creating enough 'controversial' publicity, let's get on to talk about the film itself.Plot-wise, 'Django Unchained' is quite simplistic: a freed slave sets about on a journey for revenge and to find his wife. Freed by and partnering a German bounty hunter, he travels across America, often finding himself unwelcome due to the colour of his skin and/or his freeman status. Close to their goal, the pair's plotting and deceiving is soon unearthed and an inevitable bloodbath ensues.At close to three hours in length, watching this is like overtaking a National Express coach (not my words). Large amounts of the film are filled with long stretches of dialogue and storytelling, particularly by Christopher Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio. While both are good in their respective roles, they do feel designed to dominate scenes, with a 'remember how much you liked Waltz's monologues in 'Inglorious Basterds'?' feel to them. There are also drawn out moments to facilitate a piece of music that have little purpose beyond aesthetics.There's a bit too much self-indulgence on display here. The overuse of special effects in shootouts goes a bit too far, being neither frightening nor comic. The script \u2013 that a decade younger Spike Lee would have had a lot to say about \u2013 is full of parables and monologues, many of which are unnecessary.This is all at the cost of creativity. While much of what has appeared in his previous films are ideas taken from other, lesser known works, there is still a sense that he is trying to add something to them and make them his own. But with 'Django Unchained' it seems that a long- winded script, overly-comical gunplay and a controversial subject matter are the draws, with none really enough to make me want to sit for 165 minutes, especially when it started with Villa 2-1 up against QPR and I had to wait a good three hours to learn of the final score.politic1983.blogspot.com",

The entire story is permeated by violence, which is shown in all its graphic goriness. There is no act of violence too gory for this movie. People are shot, clubbed, knifed, blown up, whipped, cudgeled, mauled, beaten and stomped as well as humiliated, put down, made fun of, laughed at, bullied, and yelled at. The theme of this movie is that interpersonal conflict can be resolved only through violence, and not just nineteen-thirties type violence, i.e., a drive by shooting or a quick ambush, but by violence that is sadistic, that is, gives pleasure to the character perpetrating the mess. But along with the violence is the use of the \"N\" word which is uttered probably hundreds of times in the movie, and by all the principal characters, black and white. In a way, it seems that the \"N\" word has finally arrived. Now, is all this violence gratuitous? The answer to that question is NO! No way. Although the violence is Hollywoodish and played up to the extreme for dramatic effect, it still belongs in the movie because the story is set in a time and a place when physical violence as a way of regulating people was a norm and when people were openly exploited and physically abused. The idea of a white slaver raising a bunch of mandingoes may seem ludicrous, but such activities occurred. Black people were slaves; white people were masters, and the \"N\" word was part of the normal lexicon of the time. The acting in this movie is outstanding. Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz deserve special recognition, and the rest of cast is excellent too, especially Leonardo De Caprio who plays a villain to great dramatic effect.",

As the movie begins with sweeping scenes and men on horseback, there is a very forceful song being sung, reminiscent of the ones Frankie Laine did back in the 1950s, for movies such as the original (1957) \"3:10 to Yuma\" and \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" (1957). Christoph Waltz is dentist Dr. King Schultz, but as we soon learn he hasn't actually practiced dentistry in years, his profession is bounty hunter. After we see him in action, in a slick barroom scene which ends in his shooting a wanted man, he heads for a bigger bounty in Mississippi. The problem is he doesn't know what the men look like, and he figures, correctly, that they have taken assumed names.So he needs help, and he looks for a certain member of a chain gang of slaves. He finds him in Jamie Foxx as Django , \"The 'D' is silent.\" Django knows them, but also seeks to be reunited with his wife, who was sold as a slave to a different owner.They eventually find that plantation and slave owner, Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie, and his place is called \"Candieland.\" The wife of Django is Kerry Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft. (She had been raised by a German, and 'Broomhilda' is a corruption of the fictional German character 'Brunhilda'.) Candie is pretty easily fooled into thinking the two men wanted to buy a mandingo fighter (no real evidence that this sport ever existed) but his old slave Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen suspects something is up and correctly figures out Django and Broomhilda know each other, and that the real mission is to take her away. All this results in about the biggest, bloodiest gunfight one will ever see.I will grant that Tarantino's films have their moments, but his insistence on violence and gore surpasses what most viewers welcome in a movie. Even though I knew it was all fake, and over the top, I still cringed. And maybe that is what he wanted the audience to do.",

Based on a series of spaghetti westerns, it depicts a former slave looking for his wife...and getting revenge in the process. Jamie Foxx plays the title character whose unexpected acquaintance with a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) sets on a path to reunite with his beloved (Kerry Washington).Since this is a Tarantino movie, there's naturally a lot of graphic violence done in very good taste. But probably the most surprising thing is Leonardo DiCaprio's role. So far he's pretty much always played likable characters. Here his role is that of a deliciously evil plantation owner who has what appears to be an incestuous relationship with his sister. Equally impressive is Samuel L. Jackson's role as the house (N word). Not only does Jackson naturally use his common word - the one that graced his wallet in \"Pulp Fiction\" and dominated the famous line in \"Snakes on a Plane\" - but he turns the Uncle Tom character into someone who looks down on blacks as much as any slave-owner. Django, meanwhile, often gives everyone a soft stare while the bounty hunter leads the conversation.As is Tarantino's protocol, he gives a bunch of forgotten and/or retired stars supporting roles: Don Johnson and Bruce Dern play slave-owners; Dennis Christopher (\"Breaking Away\") plays an assistant; Ted Neeley (\"Jesus Christ Superstar\"), Robert Carradine (\"Revenge of the Nerds\") and Tom Savini (the famous makeup artist) play trackers; and Franco Nero (the original Django) plays a man who understands the pronunciation. Jonah Hill appears in the movie's funniest scene.It all adds up to one really good movie. So far Quentin Tarantino (who appears as a mining company employee) has not disappointed, and I'm very eager to see his next movie. You know that he'll do something neat. In the meantime, \"Django Unchained\" is one for the ages! If you haven't seen the original \"Django\", it's also worth seeing.",

Some of the story strained credulity (look it up), but it stayed within the bounds of believability... until the German bounty hunter shot DeCaprio. Then believability went out the window.The movie didn't even make sense within itself. The entire film built up Dr. Schultz as not only a great shot, but also an extremely cunning strategist. And yet, he shot DeCaprio and then just stupidly said, \"I couldn't help it!\" and stood there waiting to be killed. (Which he was.) But his derringer had two barrels, which presumably means two bullets, so why didn't he whirl around and shoot the guy who was standing there with a gun?He could have, but then there wouldn't have been the bloodbath that follows, which I guess is Quentin Tarantino's \"signature.\" The movie quickly degenerates into a stupid, pointless bloodbath. White guys come out of nowhere to be shot, blood gets spattered everywhere, and so what?Then the film gets even worse! The black guy who killed so many white people is in the hands of his oppressors, yet instead of torturing and killing him, they decide to send him off to a (allegedly horrible) mine, thus giving him the opportunity to escape and wreak his horrible vengeance. Does this seem believable to ANYONE? After that, it's completely predictable. I don't need to tell you what happens because you can figure it out for yourself. But think about this: the movie makes a big deal about how nobody in the South back then was used to seeing a black person on a horse. For most of the film, the white Dr. Schultz accompanied Django and helped smooth the way. But at the end of the movie, Django and his (black) wife ride away on horses -- in Mississippi before the Civil War! So they'll just wander through the South to freedom? Really?? What a great happy ending! I could criticize this piece of sh*t on many more levels, but I've wasted enough time on it.I actually liked the first 3/4 of this film. I absolutely HATED the last section. And ultimately, Quentin Tarantino's popularity says something troubling about the state of American culture.",

            "content": "With a film that's part a throwback to the black exploitation films of the Seventies and part a homage to the ballet violence of Sam Peckinpah, Quentin Tarantino has given us Django Unchained about a newly freed slave turned bounty hunter under the tutelage of Christoph Walz.When this film opens poor Jamie Fox as the title character is part of a group of slaves chained up and heading for the auction block. But it turns out to be his lucky day as traveling dentist Christoph Walz wants to make a private deal because Fox can identify three brothers who are wanted. Walz is a bounty hunter with abolitionist tendencies and he makes short work of the slavers and has a paper making Fox his legal whom he immediately frees.Fox agrees to become Walz's partner, but he's got some conditions of his own like finding and freeing his wife who was deliberately sold separately from him. They do a good season's work and then go on the mission for Kerry Washington, Fox's wife. She's on a Mississippi plantation owned by Leonardo DiCaprio.If DiCaprio's character were around today he'd be a charter member of the White Citizen's Council. He takes white supremacy as a simple matter of fact. DiCaprio got deserved raves for his performance. But the most intriguing role in the film for me was that of Samuel L. Jackson who plays the head of the household servants. Seeing Jackson in his part took me back to early Nineties when I saw a production of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard with the character of Piers who was a servant and who totally identified with his employers. And the aristocrats who employed him just think of him as part of the furniture. There's a lot of Piers in Jackson's character with a nasty racial component that smacks of Uncle Tom.Quentin Tarantino saw a lot of those films that starred people like Richard Roundtree, James Brown, and Fred Williamson back when I was a lot younger in creating Django. He also took careful note of how Sam Peckinpah staged his violent scenes in such things as The Getaway and The Wild Bunch.Still it's the players that make this one work, DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson most of all.",

            "content": "Django succeeds in so many areas - it crosses many genres, and despite its long runtime is propulsive and enjoyable throughout. It does have a great script with both funny and tense interactions. The plot is simple but effective as we are drawn into Django's story and Schultz's thoughtfully planned adventures. There is no doubt about the quality of the cast - Foxx and Waltz are excellent and Di Caprio steals every scene he's in, with a manic gleam in his eye. Tarantino is still a terrible actor and should really stop indulging himself with relevant roles in his movies. Race is at the heart of the movie, and I think Tarantino did manage to portray the time period and ideas appropriately. Where the movie turned from an equally fun and tense, sharp experience was the frustrating third act. The plot is shaky in Schultz acting so rashly and not prepared to kill the other men after Candie, and to a lesser degree in the willingness of the men to listen to Django's plan from the start. The biggest problem was the shootout, where Tarantino clearly couldn't resist making it a gratuitous, over-the-top spectacle. The deaths were wildly visually exaggerated, and while the movie had cleanly balanced its humor and intensity earlier, the shootout discarded both in favor of superficial, bloody action. It was so jarring to me as a viewer, being transported to this completely different tone and cinematography style. The ending message also does simplify the more complex plot and thematic developments to Django being a badass and getting revenge and his girl, which was a small letdown. It is epic, and the scene where Who Did That To You started playing was invigorating, that shootout scene just took me out of the movie, and minor errors like that kept it from being the knockout I was so ready to proclaim it.",

Here Tarantino takes the slave theme to the max ending in all out war and revenge. Yet the story is entertaining and clever you have a well to do dentist Dr. King Schultz(the terrific veteran Christoph Waltz)who goes rogue and becomes a bounty hunter and he acts underneath as a slave freedom crusader. As Dr. Schultz purchases a young but rough and rugged slave named Django(Jamie Foxx)who in return for freedom will work with the doctor to hunt down wanted rich and evil slave owners. Yet a prize awaits for Django in the end as the goal is to rescue his slaved wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington). And the journey is interesting with plenty of blood, guts, and violence thru the south and rural dirty roads that lead to the big house of the arrogant and rich big time Mississippi plantation owner mister Calvin Candie(in a to the max and well acted role by Leonardo DiCaprio).

Perhaps commercially successful would be a better term. Or perhaps well-known. Regardless of the exact term, we don't usually see films this full of violence and gore outside of indie films. Which is a shame, because in my opinion this is an excellent film. Excellent.Though don't get me wrong. It's not a good film just because it has a lot of brutality, blood and extreme portrayals of violence. It's a good film because it has excellent characters, an interesting story and it is shot so well that you're transported right into the infamous antebellum era from the very first scene. It's a brutal film yes, but the era was equally brutal, and I give this film props for not shying away from that fact. Sure Mandingo fights might never have existed, but slavery was still a horrifying phenomenon, and this film deals with the subject admirably.The things I enjoyed the most are by far the characters. Tarantino has always had a talent for writing unusual and intriguing personalities and this film is no different. The dialogues are not quite as quotable as in his other films and there is not a clear winner for the best scene in this film, unlike in his previous ones, but the whole still holds together. The actors are equally as capable, though Christoph Waltz once again steals the show as Dr. King Schultz, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson are also very good in their roles. The only real nitpick I have is that perhaps the character of Django (Jamie Foxx) is a bit too bland compared to the rest of the outlandish characters, but then again he is the audience surrogate, so it kind of works. Perhaps he would have needed a bit more spice, but that's just my opinion.As for the story, I quite honestly feel that the ending dragged a bit too long. Or should I say that there was one ending too many. The film almost reaches a resolution, but then it suddenly throws in a twist that keeps it going for another twenty minutes. The twist has a purpose and it has been foreshadowed, but it still feels unneeded. But before that the film is pure gold. Especially the first hour or so, which is full of crazy scenes, intriguing character development and great atmosphere.Who would like this film? Well, if you're a fan of Tarantino, you're probably going to love this one. It's full of his unique style and visuals and the man is still going strong. If you're unfamiliar with Tarantino, you're going to like this if you're a fan of blazing action, interesting characters, westerns and/or great storytelling. However, if you're squeamish about blood, violence and gore, even by a little bit, stay as far away from this film as humanly possible. It's a film for adults, pure and simple. And for what it is, it's perhaps one of the best films I've ever seen.",

Unlike, say, GHOST DOG: WAY OF THE SAMURAI or THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS, DJANGO UNCHAINED doesn't seem as much like a filmmaker paying homage to what has come before as grave robbing. Sure, everybody does it, but the two aforementioned movies were done with a bit more genuine love, it seems, than this one. Scenes drag on interminably (THIS script won an Academy Award???), which is bad enough, but my biggest gripe has to be the PERFORMANCES. I don't know who the lead actor is (nor do I care), but he reminded me of the actors in movies like THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVERA and SIX STRING SAMURAI: he's clearly an actor doing his lines- nothing more; we never, at any point in the pointless proceedings, feel like he IS the character. The scene where we see Django's djunk was more than a tad odd: the actor holding said djunk does so gently, and releases the djunk carefully. I'd be willing to bet that that was co-star Jaime Foxx's favorite day on the set... (Ah, to be cradled in the loving hands of a caring director...)",

            "content": "For the past twenty years, writer/director Quentin Tarantino has been entertaining us in a hilariously cringing way. Sadly, those twenty years have only brought us only eight films (not counting his writing and producing efforts). But yet each one of those eight films has a marvelous quality. One of his qualaties is his killer dialogue, which is always whip smart and hilarious.Another quality is this: Tarantino has a gift for making the most serious of topics hilarious. This was displayed three years ago with his last film, Inglourious Basterds (my favorite film of 2009), which revolved around a group of Jewish Americans known as \"The Basterds\", who hunted down the Third Reich. With \"Basterds\", Tarantino re-wrote history in an extraordinary way, which probably led to a lot of bickering from historians. His latest film, Django Unchained, is even more controversial. Historians might bicker again. Forget'em. Sit back, shut up, and get consumed by QT's latest revenge fantasy.Django (Jamie Foxx, who I don't like but is enjoyable here) is a slave in the 1800's. Enter Dr. King Shultz (the expectedly brilliant Christoph Waltz, whose show-stealing performance in \"Basterds\" led him to a much deserved Oscar),a dentist/bounty hunter who lets Django free and gives him an offer he can't refuse: If he helps him hunt down some people, then he will help him find his wife, Bromhilda (the always lovely Kerry Washington). Bromhilda, as it turns out, is currently the slave of a damn lunatic plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio, giving one of his best performances).Waltz is always perfect, but really when DiCaprio is on screen it is his show. Like Waltz's Hans Landa from \"Basterds\", Tarantino has written yet another scene stealing villain. Candie is a maniac, and once DiCaprio steps on screen, he, as he says in the film,\"had my curiosity, but now you have my attention\". Lastly, in his best performance in years, we have Samuel L. Jackson as Candie's conniving slave, Stephen. Almost unrecognizable in latex, Jackson's character is what the true definition of a bastard is. Great supporting work from the three. I expect to see at least one of them on the ballot this season.I have absolutely no idea where Django Unchained compares with every other QT film, because it feels like every QT film is better than the last. I can tell you that it's no Pulp Fiction, but that said, not many movies are as good as that one. What I can tell you is that this is one of the year's best, without a doubt in my mind. This is the funniest movie about racism, and that is probably a sentence that will never be typed ever again.But while being hilarious, it is also cringingly real, and it doesn't shy away from the fact that this period happened. The fact that a man could combine drama, action, and comedy together is really something to admire. Forget what Spike Lee has said. He's a hack compared to Tarantino. I loved every second of this film. I will admit that is does sort of run on a little too long, but really it's just a bloody good time from the opening credits and onward. A+",

A couple of years back Tarantino thought hey, lets create shootout scenes that involve everyone dying in about the space of ten seconds. The first time he did this it was great. Now it feels like a joke we've seen too many times. Can't we have a prolonged action scene where the tension builds up and up?Secondly there are a lot of what are apparently minor flaws: Why does the woman (as Django shoots her at the end of the movie) fly off to the side as if pulled by a rope? Is it meant to look fake? If so why? I don't get it. Why introduce the mysterious character of the woman with the red bandanna across her face, only to have her disposed of in the space of ten seconds? Why does Shultz shoot Candie at a time when he knows it risks the girl's life? Seems out of character to me, since he has risked everything to save the girl. Also the Shultz character seems to be too closely akin to the character the same actor played in Inglorious Basterds (which I felt was a much better movie). Couldn't they come up with something more varied? And the Australians working for the mining company are utterly implausible. Did they somehow get teleported directly from outback Australia to Southern USA without losing one iota of their slang and dialect? I don't buy it.Anyway I could go on picking holes in this movie.

            "content": "You would be surprised if Quentin Tarantino ever made a truly bad movie. But he has made a few which, though not bad, are somewhat disappointing. Django Unchained is one of those. Honestly, this movie is a bit of a mess. An intriguing mess, at times a very entertaining mess. But still a mess. The movie gets away from Tarantino somewhat. His grand vision for what he wanted the movie to be ultimately lets him down. He couldn't let go of any of that vision, couldn't restrain himself. He put it all up there on the screen. And it proved to be just a little bit too much.The movie takes place in the pre-Civil War South. It is a story about slavery and Tarantino spares nothing in portraying the awfulness and brutality associated with that particular Southern institution. The hero of the piece is freed slave Django, unchained as the film's title would suggest and free to seek vengeance. But for Django more important than seeking vengeance is finding, and freeing, his wife who remains a slave. He is aided by the rather odd German dentist Schultz who does not actually make his money in dentistry. Schultz has a rather different occupation, a rather bloody one. And he is very good at his job so the bodies pile up in a hurry. Schultz, the man responsible for freeing Django, takes the former slave under his wing. Django helps Schultz do his bloody work and eventually Schultz will help Django find his wife.From its very intriguing beginning in which we meet the very mysterious Schultz the movie grabs your attention and certainly piques your interest. You desperately want to know who this mysterious man is, what he's up to. However once those questions are answered the movie begins to lose some momentum. It often feels as if the movie is just biding its time until it gets to the real story, the plot to free Django's wife. In the meantime things drag. There are a number of scenes which seem completely unnecessary. A little more focus would have done wonders for this movie. As it is things don't really perk up again until we finally, after much meandering, meet the despicable plantation owner Calvin Candie. This loathsome individual is the man who owns Django's wife. How do Django and Schultz plan to free her? It's quite the elaborate plan which, for the movie, is a bit unfortunate as it takes so much time to set the plan up. We now have the new character of Candie to interest us, and hating him is quite good fun, but again the movie struggles with pace. The big moments in this movie are big indeed. But there is too much dead space in between those big moments. At 165 minutes long this is a movie that is much too long for its own good. The crackling energy you expect to be running throughout a Tarantino film is missing. The director lost his way a bit.So there is a twinge of disappointment with this movie. But that does not mean it is a bad movie. It clearly could have been better but as is it is certainly worth seeing. After seeing it once you may not want to see it again though, it is a somewhat distasteful movie. Tarantino is never one to shy away from violence and the gore in this one is off the charts, it's a real bloodbath. It's just too much, way over the top. In and around the spasms of violence there is a lot here to recommend the movie though. It's a good revenge story, you've got heroes worth rooting for and bad guys who are as bad as bad can be. The movie is generally very well acted. Jamie Foxx as Django and Christoph Waltz as Schultz make for a very good team. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't entirely convince as the villainous Candie. It is as if DiCaprio is trying a little too hard to be evil, it comes off as being a bit forced. But in the moments when Candie is charming, and yes even this monster has his charms, DiCaprio seems much more comfortable. Notably fine work is turned in by Samuel L. Jackson playing Candie's loyal house slave Stephen. In his own way Stephen is perhaps more reprehensible than Candie and Jackson does a fine job of making that character his own. Tarantino fills out his cast well, supporting parts and little cameo roles all handled capably by a multitude of performers. All in all this is a movie with a lot of good pieces but there is the sense the pieces don't all fit together properly. Tarantino didn't make a bad movie. But he didn't make a great movie either.",

His classic bloodbaths, intriguing dialog and black humor finally had a tribute that is \"Django Unchained.\" Many people did not like the movie or for being too silly, or too long, or excessive violence. Will a Tarantino fan crazy as me, to realize the enormity of the great masterpiece that \"Django\" can be? Not only is one of the best of Tarantino movies, but it is the tribute that the writer-director make to his films, giving a demonstration of who he is and its material.Django is arguably the greatest production of Tarantino, but I know that size does not make the content, but greater in everything. Here we see the combination of the various elements of Tarantino's films, the title character and history elements, are there all together, just pay attention.At the beginning we see Django (Jamie Fox) as a poor, simple and sufferer slave, who meets the great Dr. King Schultz (Crhistoph Waltz), and with him the chance of vengeance of his old owners, and later regaining his love Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), these first 45 minutes of the film we see how Django grow both spiritually and mentally and becomes a killing machine that becomes later. Also in these first few minutes of the film we see elements of \"Kill Bill,\" for example, the Bride of Uma Thurman, a sufferer with visions of the past in search of redemption and revenge against those who took her all what he loved. Django is her male version, and as The Bride is an expert on samurai swords, Django is in revolvers.In the next two hours we see the plan that Django and Schultz plan, a foolproof plan to recover the wife of Django from the cruel Calvin Candlie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a plan that seems to be impossible to know when Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson). In these two hours we see elements of \"Inglourious Basterds\" and \"Pulp Fiction\". From \"Inglourious\" is the plan that seems foolproof that will lead to an enhuge end with small twists and obstacles ahead, along with an intriguing dialog scenes, as the dinner scene where the 5 characters are connected in one intriguing line of dialog that lead's to the unexpected end, such as scene that resembles the scene of the German Pub. From \"Pulp\" is the friendly and contradictory partnership between Django and Schultz, that closely resembles the duo Vincent and Jules. Two people who are very friendly and respect one another but a small rivalry between the two in what has regarding their attitudes or as Schultz says \"getting dirty\". The end of the second act, delivering the third and final act where the unexpected happens, like any Tarantino movie, a tremendous scale of grandeur.Django might not show a Western as we think it would, mainly because the film is set in the American South, being then a Southern, but \"Inglourious Basterds\" did not show much of the war and not the situation of the Jews (only the beginning) and focuses attention on killing Nazis. Tarantino uses the environment to explore the southern's slavery that existed in America during the time, but at the same time maintaining the elements of a Western, not getting shot during a firefight; a small town with a old sheriff with a dirty past; a lone ranger looking for redemption.At the same subject, the characters, all well-established, and in them we can see several elements of other Tarantino films. Django seems a mixture of Jackie Brown, The Bride and Vincent See, all alike in gestures and attitudes but also their situation in the whole plot. A character a bit shy but very smart and they can even be BADASS, and their situations in the story that almost seems to be a secondary character; Schultz looks a bit like Winnfiel Jules (Pulp Fiction) and Max Cherry (Jackie Brown), a character cultured with a very particular vision of the world and with his own philosophy of what is good; Stephen is the mixture of Marcellus Wallace (Pulp Fiction) and Ordell Robbie (Jackie Brown), a \"n#\" who thinks superior to all others and can be really cruel. The only character who seems to be the same original was Calvin Candie, a cynical and cruel slave owner.Many complain that Django can hardly stands out in the film being the main one, but how many times in Tarantino's previous films the main character was half out when the secondary characters spoke. But here the very minor characters seem to stand out when they talk among themselves. When is a scene of Schultz, Calvin begins to talk stealing his scene; when is a scene of Calvin, Stephen starts talking and steals his scene; when is a scene is Stephen, Schultz starts talking and steals his scene. And so it goes on in this dialog triangle of secondary characters, and all of them in the Badass voice of Django appears as a roller-coaster doing everything shake. This just proves that Tarantino can still do screenplays with mastery and persuasion.The performances of the entire cast can also be fantastic, on the style of Tarantino, Jamie Fox can install itself in the world of Tarantino with a performance that is the beginning of a simpleton slave until its evolution into a BADASS lone-ranger; Chistoph Waltz superb as always and once again manages to be the favorite character of the movie for those who attend; Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances; Samuel L. Jackson proving to be one of the best supporting actors in the business. All amazing as the movie itself.\"Django Unchained\" manages to be one of the funniest films of Tarantino, but also one of the most intriguing ones, with a really well written screenplay. A great product delivery that Tarantino has always given us and as always challenging and causing controversy in society, proving that it still has much to give.",

            "content": "Anyone finding this film actually enjoyable should seek immediate psychiatric help. The highly graphic depiction of dozens of revoltingly perverse and entirely gratuitous killings together with endless scenes of physical and psychological torture spread over nearly three hours of virtually plot less melodrama written only to facilitate this obscenity can only appeal to the mentally damaged. You have been warned.A 'German' bounty hunter recruits a black slave by murdering his owners when they refuse to sell him. He needs the slave in order to identify some outlaws whom he wishes to kill for the reward money. However he subsequently guns down dozens of men with little if any identification or certainty that they have ever committed any crime other than their support for slavery - which at the time in 1850's Texas was entirely legal.Were the film to feature typical Hollywood 'clean kills' this review would be less critical. But Tarrentino treats his loyal acolytes instead to a virtually non-stop feast of gushing blood, exploding body parts and agonized screams spiced by the odd bullet aimed deliberately in the groin or knees in order to extend the suffering and misery of the unfortunate victims - and more emphatically, the perverse pleasure of those who enjoy witnessing his 'art'.There is one redeeming feature of this whole ghastly mess; the performance of Leonardo as a gentleman slave owner is absolutely flawless. His wonderful diction and captivating gestures enlivened my flagging attention like a beacon of shining talent amidst the murky gloom of mediocrity. But alas his is a small cameo contribution which the producers have shamelessly exploited with an entirely unwarranted 3rd place billing behind the central pair.Leonardo's subsequent retirement from Hollywood is now fully understood. One wonders how much he knew of the nature of this production before he agreed to participate in it. And perhaps more importantly the decline in American society characterized by frequent senseless and perverse killings is also explained by such trash for plainly this sort of film must play a pivotal role in formulating the mindset of the millions who are subjected to it.But the perversity of the Hollywood system that has nominated this filth for several Oscars (tonight) cannot be explained so easily. How on Earth could such a production be given so many accolades?",

They may have so many offensive things about them, especially the gratuitous bloody violence and the excessively foul language. But they, this is what people want out of a Quentin Tarantino film! It would not be a Quentin Tarantino film without these mercenary things! And indeed, \"Django Unchained\" is a trove of them, 2 hours and 45 minutes of it!Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave sometime before the Civil War broke out. He was rescued from his new owners by dentist/bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). As Schultz gives Django his freedom and makes him his partner, Django expressed his desire to find, rescue and reunite with his beautiful, German-speaking wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who was now owned by the sadistic Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). All hell breaks loose in Candieland when Django unleashes all his suppressed anger to get his wife back!People who are not used to Quentin Tarantino style (or maybe even those who are) would shirk their eyes away from the screen many times for every cracking whiplash across a slave's back, every explosive shotgun shot going through a body and every bloody punch in that graphic Mandingo fight. Eventually, in the final Grand Guignol scenes, maybe everyone in the audience will already be desensitized despite the interminable fountains of blood that will shoot out of countless bodies in what seemed to be thirty minutes of continuous gunfire. That is classic Tarantino for you!The actors all attack their roles with outrageous glee. Well all, except probably the lead star Jamie Foxx, who plays it \"cool\" in stark contrast with the rest of the hyper cast. Christoph Waltz already won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his role of Schultz, but honestly for me, this is practically the same type of acting I saw from him in both \"Inglorious Basterds\" and \"Water for Elephants.\" Now, Leonardo DiCaprio, I think he was robbed of a nomination here. He was evil incarnate here, such a different Leo from what we are used to seeing him in. Special mention would have to go to Samuel L. Jackson, whom I did not immediately recognize as the conniving Stephen, the sinister head manservant of Candieland. Those piercing eyes of his baleful glare were something else!It was a great idea to bring the spaghetti Western genre to the deep South. The music was so 70s with those jangly guitars, except for the occasional anachronistic incursion of rap music. The sense of dark humor was all over it, under all that bloodshed and gore. There was a scene with cameos of Jonah Hill, Don Johnson and their KKK masks which was outright hilarious. Funny but I realized that THIS is how Tarantino would tell a love story!But if you ask me if this will win the Oscar for Best Picture, my answer would probably be NO. I do not see this type of film appeal to generally conservative Academy voters. But the fact that it even made it to the final 9 nominees is already recognition enough for QT.",

            "review_title": "Tarantino brilliantly turns Spaghetti Western on its head but then undermines it through cheap revenge fantasy",
            "content": "With clever aplomb, Quentin Tarantino has turned the Spaghetti Western on its head and created a vision of the pre-Civil War South and Wild West, much more like it probably was: a landscape replete with the nightmare images of slavery, highlighting a society permeated by racism at every turn. When he decides to be 'serious', Tarantino 'gets it' and proffers up a series of disturbing images, scenes and characters that prove on a certain level, he's read his history.The opening scene, where a group of male slaves in chains are being transported by the Speck Brothers, introduces us to the brutal world of slavery. One notes the horrible condition these men are in and the sadistic way they're treated by the racist Ace and Dicky Speck. The brutal way in which the slaves take revenge on Dicky, after his horse falls on him after being shot, suggests their actions are an understandable reaction to years of terrible oppression.Tarantino is hardly finished. There are scenes of slaves on the way to the slave market in shackles, often forced to wear gruesome metal head locks that resemble the kind of restraints one associates with Hannibal Lecter in 'Silence of the Lambs'; a terrifying mob of hooded racist night riders, obvious precursors of the Ku Klux Klan, on their way to take revenge on Tarantino's protagonists, Dr. Schultz and Django; Mandingo fighting where blacks are forced to basically kill one another in the wrestling ring while racist whites bet on the fight for sport; and the copious use of the 'n-word' throughout the film (Tarantino doesn't care about offending modern day sensibilities--he realizes that the overuse of that demeaning word, was commonplace during those times!).Tarantino is at his best when he comes up with a character like Calvin J. Candie, the racist plantation owner, so winningly played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Candie is not just your average racist brute as are so many of the other characters in the film. Candie represents a racist with intelligence, as he toys with those he lords over, sadistically deriving pleasure through both physical and psychological means. In perhaps the most disturbing scene in the film, he coaxes one of his top Mandingo fighters down from a tree, after the poor, broken man confesses he's no longer able to fight and then sics a pack of savage dogs on him, tearing the man to pieces. Candie also is shown to have much in common with the Nazis in the 20th century, as he pontificates about what he believes to be the genetic inferiority of the black man.After all this clever scene setting as well as some brilliant writing in his portrait of Candie, why does Tarantino undermine his story by resorting to the same kind of puerile wish fulfillment fantasy, we saw in full relief in his previous effort, 'Inglorious Basterds'? The answer can be found in the examination of Tarantino's two protagonists, Dr. Schultz and Django.While Christoph Waltz proves to be highly entertaining as Dr. King Schultz, the witty dentist turned bounty hunter, one must recognize that Schultz, personifies Tarantino himself. Not only does Tarantino want to be on the winning side, but he must prove, as a white Italian, that he is entirely sympathetic to black people and is 100% against racism. So here he grafts this 21st century sensibility on to his Schultz character, who is such a friend of black people, that he'll not only make Django his partner but go out of his way and risk his life, to help Django save his wife from the clutches of the very dangerous Calvin J. Candie.It hardly seems believable that Schulz would be able to save himself in that scene where he appeals to the Marshal's good will. I would imagine that after shooting the sheriff, the Marshal and his posse wouldn't have been in the mood to listen to Schultz's story that he was a bounty hunter, and would have shot them both on the spot. I was unable, however, to suspend my disbelief when it came to Schultz making Django his assistant, and parading around, ensuring all those racist townspeople got their comeuppance. It might have made Tarantino feel good that his white liberal Schultz and super-human racist killer, Django, were so successful, but the reality of the 1858 South, was quite different (Think about John Brown's fate after attempting to start a slave revolt when he raided Harper's Ferry).If Schultz is a stand-in for today's white liberal, Django represents the flip side: militant black people's wish fulfillment. Spike Lee is completely right that 'Django' trivializes the history of slavery (I wish only he saw the film so he can back up his beliefs with specific detail). When Django kills Candie's sister and Samuel L. Jackson's Uncle Tom, Stephen, and then blows up the plantation, it gives those unfamiliar with American history the wrong impression. Quite the opposite occurred: there was little opportunity for blacks to revolt against the slave master; and when such revolts did occur, they were brutally suppressed.By indulging himself with these revenge fantasies, Tarantino may be encouraging ignorant young people to resort to violence. Some of these young people may erroneously equate the racist behavior seen in 'Django' with people of today. In our own time, is it right to blame Germans born after World War II, for the crimes committed by their grandparents? Ultimately, Tarantino succeeds when he transforms the Spaghetti Western into the nightmare reality of a pre-Civil War racist world. But by also accepting the stock conventions of that genre, with all of its attendant juvenile trappings (e.g. one bloodbath after another), coupled with his need to be on the 'winning side' and indulging in revenge fantasies, Tarantino ends up appealing to the baser instincts of those who deny over 150 years of progress and hark back to an age that no longer exists.",

            "content": "I am a hardcore Tarantino fan and I must say I had great expectations for this movie. I can now honestly say that in my opinion Django Unchained is Tarantino's worst film to this day. Lets start with the first major flaw. The soundtrack. Usually Tarantino has great taste for his soundtracks and on most of his movies (pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, kill bill) it actually is a fundamental part and complements the film. On Django it seems that Mr. Tarantino got Lil Wayne to choose some of the tracks. Hip Hop in a western?? Completely ruined the movie for me. Second, the length of the movie is ridiculously long... Almost 3 hours. Usually films of such lengths have intricate plot lines and/or are made to tell an exceptionally long story. Not in this case. The movie could have easily been 100 minutes long. If it wasn't for the excessive and unnecessary dialogues, the useless KKK scene, the first 45 minutes of the movie which have almost nothing to do with the main plot line. The last 30 minutes of bloodshed serve to no use and I guess is just a fetish of the director. Mr. Tarantino seems to lose the sense of time and you can never tell where his ego ends and the plot begins.Third, bad acting. Jamie Foxx is impalpable. Besides a few punch lines and some dramatic moments Foxx doesn't portray the slave from the pre-civil war era but mostly comes off as a thug from the hood. Di Caprio is too pretty-faced to seriously be the villain in this movie and if it wasn't for the horrors happening around the character (Candie) you could hardly tell he's the bad guy. Waltz and Jackson on the other hand with their excellent performances keep this movie together. I was really hoping Tarantino, with such an all-star cast, could have pulled off a both socially relevant and at the same time entertaining film, but again I was mistaken.",

Still, those are the only criticisms of Django: Unchained that I could find through my watch that cause it to be BARELY below Tarantino's previous film.

            "content": "Reservoir Dogs was a pretty conventional buddies-in-crime movie that became noteworthy for its level of violence. Tarantino got himself under control for his sophomore movie, Pulp Fiction--one of my favorites. Pulp Fiction was violent, no doubt, but it was held together by well-developed, interesting characters and dialog. With the exception of the pawn shop crew, you had some level of empathy for all the major characters.Tarantino became much admired after these two movies and seems to have become lazy and dependent on shocking viewers. He reminds me of the creature in John Carpenter's The Thing. He watches other works and stores snippets away until he can assemble them into something different yet reminiscent of the other works. The extended conversations involving DiCaprio and Waltz kept bringing to mind the plantation scene from Apocalypse Now Redux. Waltz's accent and quite a few references to the German language kept me thinking about Inglourious Basterds. Couple the accents with the lack of emotion as Waltz pursues his bounties, and I was thinking Schindler's List. Long panoramic shots with soaring swells of music brings to mind every spaghetti western. Put all these snippets together and you have a contemporary Tarantino movie. Django lacked smoothness; it seemed a choppy agglomeration of...snippets.Django is full of anachronisms. The count on this site is 22 plus three factual errors. Though many people rely on Hollywood to school them in history, I don't expect non-historical, fictional films to be 100% accurate, but it seems like Tarantino had a complete disregard for accuracy. Was this laziness by Tarantino or a deliberate disregard for accuracy in favor of being cool? The characters in Django were one-dimensional. Waltz's dentist was mysterious as to his back story and motivations, and Jackson's Stephen was interesting for his devotion and dismissive behavior toward his \"owner.\" (No person can own another, but very often damn sure act like it.) In fact, Stephen's dismissive attitude was unbelievable given DiCaprio's Candies' general intolerance. I think that the attitude was allowed/incorporated to protect the Samuel L. Jackson image as an eternal bad-ass. Everyone else was explicitly good or evil. No shades of grey here. And speaking of shades of grey, there seemed to be a lot of images of women being dominated, whipped, and bound. Shades of misogyny? Rumor has it that $10 million of the $100 million budget was spent on prop blood and fire hoses from which to shoot it. More stylized Hollywood violence for the motive of revenge. Any wonder that people think that the way to right every wrong is obliterate someone? The violence level in Django compared to the general level of movie violence is the difference between pornography and erotica. Perhaps Tarantino's Thing incorporates a snippet from This is Spinal Tap by putting an 11 on his violence amp. Make that a 12. Okay, let's assume that killing three dozen people in a scene is necessary to tell the story. Do we also have to see geysers of blood with every shot? Too much of anything is desensitizing and dilutive.The cast did a good job with their shallow characters. Waltz and DiCaprio stood out from the rest. Foxx, strangely enough, seemed to blend into the background in scenes involving Waltz and DiCaprio. Washington seemed to be a prop, a token as the boys played \"no, **** you.\" You probably won't hate Django, but you likely won't be very satisfied unless you drank the Tarantino Kool-Aid. I'd love to see something from him again that is the caliber of Pulp Fiction.",

            "content": "What separates Quentin Tarantino from other mainstream filmmakers is that he isn't afraid to cross the line. Others wade in safer waters, but Tarantino ventures into the deep, shark-infested waters of good taste. His films are bloody and sometimes profane, but they are always fearless and inventive. Dialogue for him can be a soliloquy so original that you wonder how he thought of it in the first place.Yet, he has never treaded more tricky waters than in his new film Django Unchained, an action western about slavery that never veers away from the ugliness of the subject. What is trickier still is that he manages to offset material that might seem offensive by making a film that is also wildly entertaining and often hysterically funny. The film ventures deep into some taboos that make you kind of wince. The film contains not only buckets of blood and gore, but also to a pervasive use of the N-word, which is peppered throughout every scene.Django Unchained, is a cornucopia of genres. It is a spaghetti western, a buddy picture, a romance, and a revenge fantasy packed so closely together that they seem to happen on top of one another. It reminds you of the old western ballads about a lone, broken man who acted bravely and whose name lived on in history, or at least in song.The story takes place is 1858 and centers on a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who is freed one day by the effete German immigrant Dr. King Shultz (Christop Waltz) who offers to buy him from his owners before turning them all into hamburger with his side-arms. Shultz passes himself off as a dentist (complete with a ridiculous over-sized springy tooth atop his wagon) but he's really a bounty hunter and he sets Django free in order to help him find his latest target.Shultz likes Django and sees that he has the chops to be a serviceable tracker, so he teaches him the tricks of the trade and finds him to be an eager student. He also learns that Django has a beautiful wife named Broomhilde (Kerry Washington) who was sold to a plantation to be a \"comfort girl.\" They agree to partner up and try to find her and Shultz helps Django transform himself into, not only a brutal fighting machine, but also something that is completely unheard of in the 19th century American south: a black man of pride, skill, sophistication and intelligence. Foxx's performance is mostly made up of deep, pained looks. He can't reveal too much too soon, but you can see that the bondage of Broomhilde is breaking his soul.The trail of Django's wife makes up the film's first half. The second is given over to a grand set-piece at the Mississippi plantation called Candie Land, mastered by a dandy named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) who pleasures himself upon the alter of slavery, not only holding his slaves in bondage or instituting a brutal activity called \"Mandingo fighting\", but in head games that are cruel and unyielding. Some of this is quite uncomfortable. Tarantino's vision of The Old South is probably closer to reality than we realize. This isn't the land of cavaliers and cotton fields. It is an unyeilding landscape that shows slavery for the apocalypse that it is.Candie thinks that Shultz and Django are there to buy a fighter, but something in Django's gaze gives an aged house slave (Samuel L. Jackson) that these visitors are not what they claim to be. That leads to a long and very tricky stand-off loaded with buckets of blood and Tarantino's trademark dialogue. This is where the movie really finds its legs. As Schultz and Django find themselves in a battle of wits with Candie, we come to realize that there is more to this plantation owner then meets the eye. At a moment when he is clued into their deception and the movie seems to be dragging, out comes a brilliant moment at the dinner table when Candie reveals his racial misanthropic vision of the separation of black and white by dissecting the skull of his father's late barber, which he seems to have kept around just for this purpose. DiCaprio, ever the nice guy in movies, reveals a adept skill at playing a villain. Young, smart, good-looking, with the smile of a Cheshire cat, he seems to revel in his world of enslavement and mental bondage. It is a great performance.If Django Unchained has one weakness it may be that when it is over, there is a feeling that Tarantino has indulged himself a bit too much \u2013 his final showdown is as bloody as it gets. He loves the genre of cheap exploitation pictures and he is willing to give them every accordance that he has at his disposal. He is willing to throw everything into this film and there is a lot of material for such a simple story. It is hard to carp when in the presence of a director so eager to please. You may come away from this film with doubts, but never at any single moment are you bored or disinterested.",

            "content": "It was always inevitable that exceptional writer/director (and actor) Quentin Tarantino would do a Western. The gleefully grisly tone; the loveably amoral characters who stay true to an alternative sense of morality. Plot lines that elongate, intertwine, divert and snap short at their leisure. All in a heightened idiosyncratic universe of escapism where charming deal out gruesome deaths to foes, friends and passers-by as casually as swatting flies, and where the bold yet astute filmmaker runs rife with risqu\u00e9 creativity. It's comfortably close to his beloved gangster genre, but with more of the outdoors and a frivolous willingness to embrace its masculine excess. In rekindling a genre that's lain dormant for quite a few years, Tarantino has always embraced the nostalgic time period of the classic Spaghetti Western, adding the old grainy Columbia logo, old-fashioned cartoon custom-made credits and titles and a recurring strumming guitar theme song celebrating the titular hero.It's through the protagonist and his personal plight that Django Unchained, like last year's The Artist, brings a defiant, retrospective modern theme to a stylistically old school picture. Yes, the brusquely exuberant filmmaker, who as a man is unexpectedly as mild-mannered and talkative as a geeky YouTube blogger, has controversially delved deep into the issues of black slavery and apartheid, in a film that's no less entertaining for it. This murderous gunslinger hasn't been driven to thoughts of vengeance simply over an old flame. Years of suffering in a world controlled by ignorant, corrupt Caucasians \u2013 revealed through rustically shot flashbacks that actually use nostalgia to add realism \u2013 has gradually seeded a bursting hatred of the privileged race that's finally unlocked, along with his dreaded shackles, by an unlikely humanitarian vigilante also interested in him as a business partner. The business is, of course, that old staple of Westerns, bounty hunting, and the eccentric, smooth talking, tenacious German Dr King Shultz (the brilliant Christoph Waltz) has special need of Djan-go (Jamie Foxx adds layer upon layer to his characterisation with every scene) in his next pursuit, as his next juicy targets have gone undercover, and our hero, having had a bloodthirsty encounter with them before they were outlawed, is the only one who can identify them. The tricky doctor is one of those most priceless hedonistic characters whose conscience is muckier than a drainpipe, but whose heart, the audience can see, is in the right place when it matters. His causal killings abhor us no more than James Bond's, and, like Jack Sparrow, there seems to be no situation this invincible rogue can't talk, scheme or shoot his way out of.He contrasts very sharply with our two other main despicable figures, who really do care for no one but themselves, however much they may pretend otherwise, and regard all people Django's race totally as brain- dead pawns, even though one of them is black himself. The vast middle section of the film is occupied by Fritz's and Django's nail-biting battle of wits with an arrogant, insulated wealthy businessman (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his jarringly sycophantic (an unrecognisably elderly Samuel L. Jackson) Negro right-hand man constantly echoing his master's callous commands to the other black servants, and laughing at his vile jokes made at their expense. It was quite a curious decision to cast these two naturally likable actors as two such realistically repulsive characters, particularly as when we first see the charming DiCaprio as Mr Calvin Candie, we have to immediately remind ourselves not to root for this character like we did with Jack Dawson and Arnie Grape, but he soon proves perfectly able \u2013 and quite exceptional in his more menacing scenes \u2013 but I had no idea I'd been watching Jackson on screen until I read the credits, and that is the mark of a truly great performance. From that very first, alarmingly potent shot of him looking at the lucky Django riding proudly into town on a horse, like a white fella, with Stephen's face full of chilling, resentful rage, it is a truly stunning portrayal of perhaps the most horrible character of the lot. Although, of course, the pleasing gallery of the heroic duo's small-minded prejudiced victims, moulded from the archetypal Western townspeople, is also effectively detestable.Like all of the greatest and most popular depictions of serious social issues, Django is both heartily funny and brutally dark in equal measure, and often simultaneously. In casual conversations about Tarantino, he's often associated with extreme, vicious violence, and indeed, a few healthy blood splatters are vital to any Tarantino picture, but none of them are ever about the blood and the gore. As actual films, rather than conversation topics, they always feature good characterisations sharp dialogue and clever writing much more than they do gunshots. Just like in the celebrity head's scene of Inglorious Basterds (2009) or the fateful toilet trips of Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction (1994), the inevitable big, glorious shootout in his latest film is the big crescendo to the mesmerising character interplay, and always has consequences explored in the following scenes. Yes, they are fun, both for us and for him, but they do not define him as a filmmaker any more than Grace Kelly, Janet Leigh and so many other blond actresses should define Alfred Hitchcock. These morsels are just the entr\u00e9es to the meatier main course.Unfortunately, though, those gory climaxes make it more difficult for underage viewers to get a ticket, but that certainly doesn't stop adults from getting in on the healthy fun on offer here.",

Tarrantino really makes the same film over and over again but with a different theme. His films are unnecessarily violent, inaccurate and down right offensive to just about everyone.The story of Django Unchained is so full of holes as to be laughable and the characters are silly caricatures. As others have said this is a mix of Spagetti Western, Pulp fiction and Blazzing Saddles.Christopher Waltz plays his part as Dr. King Schultz so well that it makes the first part watchable and in a way the story itself leaves you wanting to know what will happen in the end. After all when you have already sat through two hours you hope against hope that at least the end will make some sense of it all. sadly it doesn't and once Christopher Waltz character is gone it then becomes just another Tarrantino excuse for a movie.Kerry Washington is a bright light in a dark film and you care for her character, but Jamie Foxx, who was amazing in Ray, is dull and a contradiction of character. There is one part of the film where he became totally unbelievable, there was no reason for him to allow Calvin Candie to set the dogs on the Slave when Schultz had offered to pay for him to be saved. Why would a man who went through so much evil and violent treatment himself just because of his colour, be so uncaring of those still in Slavery?If you could only take away the graphic violence, use of modern offensive speech, historical inaccuracies, dull acting, awful script and really childish direction and you might have had a good film.I would also add that the subject of Slavery and Racism are not really subjects to take as lightly as this film does. The kind of suffering inflicted on African's transported to the West and used and treated worse than animals is not in my opinion a subject that Mr Tarrintino should be attempting to make comical.And the Jamie Foxx character in a modern setting would be seen as a reactionary terrorist. He is not a positive character and I sick of Black and Asian people being portrayed in movies in such a negative way.Other films have handled the subject of Slavery in much more realistic and empathetic way.",

Django & Schultz make a deal that after they take care of the slave owner business, they will search for Django's long lost wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington). After a little research they find out that Broomhilda is a slave owned by infamous slave owner Calvin Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio). After they reach Candieland, Candie's chief slave Stephen(Samuel L. Jackson) is suspicious about their intentions.This movie was freaking EPIC! Every second of watching this film was a delight. I liked it much better than Tarantino's previous work, Inglorious Basterds. A note on the performances. Jamie Foxx is effective as Django. However, Foxx's performance is nothing compared to the others performances. Christoph Waltz is hysterical in his portrayal of Dr.King Schultz. Leonardo DiCaprio is terrifyingly brilliant in his portrayal of the brutal Calvin Candie. Kerry Washington is great as disturbed & tortured slave Broomhilda. However, Samuel L. Jackson stands out as the evil & menacing Stephen. The slave is more wicked than Candie himself. However, this movie is not for everyone. If you are disgusted or easily disturbed by a lot of violence & gore then, you should stay away from this film. But, for everyone else this movie is a must watch. Go, have a blast!",

            "content": "Django Unchained is about a hero who saves a damsel-in-distress. The 'damsel-in- distress' is a classic theme in literature, art and film. The damsel is usually a beautiful woman placed in a dire predicament by a villain, who requires a hero to achieve her rescue. In Tarantino's film, Dr. King Schultz, a German bounty hunter, takes great pains to compare Django to Sigur\u00f0r and Broomhilda to Brynhildr (the latter characters from the Norse V\u00f6lsunga mythology). Broomhilda/Brynhildr is a stock character of fiction, particularly of melodrama. However, never in recent memory has an African American chattel slave from the 1800s been cast as a damsel-in-distress... deemed worth saving. This alone was worth seeing the movie.In Alex Haley's Roots (book and television mini-series) Kizzy is a would-be Broomhilda, a beautiful young slave woman who is savagely and repeatedly raped by slave master Tom Moore, producing a son. Kizzy becomes resigned to her fate (as Master Moore's comfort woman). Kizzy is never saved, unlike Broomhilda in Django. Another reason I mention Roots is because of the excessive use of the n-word. BET recently re-aired the mini-series as part of a holiday marathon, perhaps as a lead-in to the Dhango Unchained opening. The n-word was used in Roots about as much as it is used in Django Unchained. The n- word was what slaves were called during that time period and it was (and still should be) a term of hate. Thus, the use of the n-word in Django is more historically correct than in prior Tarantino films. Tarantino's research of chattel slavery in the U.S., during the 1800s is highlighted in the film and he addressed issues such as phrenology (measurement of the skull) and drapetomania, a supposed mental illness described by U.S. physician Samuel A. Cartwright that caused black slaves to flee captivity. At one time science was used to justify the enslavement and brutalization of African slaves in the Americas. Django is just the tip of the iceberg. The knee jerk reactions of some critics regarding the excessive use of the n-word and it being a \"slave revenge\" film was not helpful. I ignored these criticisms and saw the movie for myself. I applauded the performances by Christoph Waltz, Samuel Jackson and Leonardo DiCaprio, among the others. Samuel Jackson channeled the Boondock's Uncle Ruckus to an extreme degree. If anything, I felt Jackson had too much screen time. Also, there were a few pauses in action and dialog that seemed out of sync with the flow of the film. However, there were also quite a few humorous moments that kept me in the narrative. Towards the end of the film Tarantino pays homage to a beginning sequence from Sergio Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in the West,\" when a Native woman is told to flee the scene. A long time Ennio Morricone fan, Tarantino often makes extensive use of several Morricone pieces from several 1960s film scores. The 2009 film Inglourious Basterds also uses many Morricone pieces, as well as sharing \"Il Mercenario (Ripresa)\" with Kill Bill.To conclude, rather than label Django Unchained as a 'slave revenge' film (bringing to mind the historical fear of revolt) I find it more helpful to think of what the film attempts to do for African Americans: offer us a fictional, historical revisionist retelling of Roots with substantial alterations in the characters, to revise views shown in earlier work. The goal, here, is not to bring or keep African Americans down but to insert new mythology into a classic narrative to elevate us and maybe even unite us.",

            "content": "I know there is a law against talking about internal logic with regard to QT-movies. But I'm quite a bit fed up with sloppy, dyslexic screen writing and I'm feeling kind of outlawish, so here I go: Initially Schultz (Christoph Waltz) asks for Django's help, because Django is an acquaintance of three fugitives, the bounty hunter Schultz is after. A \"Dead or Alive\"-handbill with its sketchy description and drawing is not very reliable and shooting the wrong guy can easily happen and it will just as easily get yourself hanged. Therefore the recruiting of Django does make perfect sense. Looking for another wanted man Schultz enters the next town, where he's never been, meets him, who is now the sheriff of this town and whom he's never seen, and kills him after a few seconds, without even talking to him. This is the moment \"Django Unchained\" stops making sense.Schultz is a cold blooded serial killer who murders people because some sheet of paper tells him that he's got the right to do so. He is a hypocrite, he gets mad at someone who also executes his state approved right to kill, but with sadistic pleasure. Murder is fine as long as the state tells you so and you do it for business, not for fun. In the original Spaghetti Western a guy like that would have always been the villain, many of the heroes were \"Wanted Men\" themselves. In \"Django Unchained\" he is the only human and sympathetic figure and without any doubt the main character. In many ways the spirit of \"Django Unchained\" is the exact opposite of that found in the movies Tarantino tried to emulate.The story of the bland eponymous Django's development from slave in chains and rags to sharp dressed gunslinger with sunglasses is above all ridiculous and boring. So after Schultz's exit this excessively overlong movie becomes even more of an ordeal, although you get to see the explosion of a queer, ugly old geezer, who really deserved to die. He is played by QT himself and that's only something to look forward to and no spoiler, because naturally it has little plot relevance.\"Django Unchained\" is about hating a whole ethnic group, just like \"Inglourious Basterds\", where Tarantino made sure to avoid the impression that there could be a German (a \"Nazi\") who wasn't devilishly evil. The nice young Zoller turns out to be a wannabe rapist and the clever detective Landa (Waltz) turns into a monster, strangling a helpless woman to death. After all Tarantino wanted his viewers to enjoy the butchering of hundreds of Germans in a cinema hall. In \"Django Unchained\" the murderous Schultz is the only decent white guy. All the others are preoccupied with torturing and humiliating blacks, so there is no need to dehumanize them any further. Will some savior please rise and rid the world of this evil? \"Django Unchained\" tells the sentimental education of this savior, Django, that ends with the exit of his teacher. Now the Hate is strong with this one. He uses it for the righteous cause, to kill white people. All of them. The murders of the self-righteous are always cool and justified, right? Hypocrisy is the new religion. Tarantino is one of its high priests, \"Django Unchained\" is a High Mass. Enjoy! \"Once Upon a Time in the West\", \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", \"Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid\" - those are masterworks. \"Django Unchained\" is the work of a slave, designed to debase its audience.",

            "content": "With the help of a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz), a freed slave (Jamie Foxx) sets out to rescue his wife (Kerry Washington) from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio).Take the blaxploitation classics \"Boss\" and \"Mandingo\", throw in some spaghetti westerns, stir them around inside the brain of Quentin Tarantino, and you get this: another masterpiece from the perennial film student. Whether or not one likes his directing or his acting, Tarantino's writing has always been his strong point, and he exhibits that again here.I want to address the issue of race, as this film sort of forces us to do. Spike Lee said about the film, \"All I'm going to say is that it's disrespectful to my ancestors. That's just me... I'm not speaking on behalf of anybody else.\" Although I am a white man and cannot speak as the descendant of American slaves, I did find it to be a powerful condemnation of slavery unlike we have seen nearly anywhere else. The film was the flip side to \"Gone With the Wind\". And its moral ambiguity was done flawlessly -- Django is the hero, yet he kills mercilessly and even allows slaves to die if it helps him meet his goals. He is an egoistic utilitarian -- no harm is too much if it helps his personal greater good.\"Django\" and its approach to race is interesting from the perspective of someone who has watched Tarantino's career unfold. While I would hardly consider Tarantino a racist, he has written some questionable lines over the years, and batted the n-word around more freely than most white folks would feel proper doing (e.g. the \"dead n***** storage\" line in \"Pulp Fiction\" or the exchange in \"True Romance\" where Sicilians were said to have \"black blood\" and were \"spawned by n*****s\"). Yet, he has frequently had strong black characters (Marcellus Wallace, and especially Jackie Brown). What do we make of this? Has Tarantino found a way to transcend race in ways few others have? I also want to put the film in perspective. Owen Gleiberman wrote that \"Django isn't nearly the film that Inglourious was. It's less clever, and it doesn't have enough major characters \u2013 or enough of Tarantino's trademark structural ingenuity \u2013 to earn its two-hour-and-45-minute running time.\" I am mixed on this remark. While I do think that \"Inglourious\" was a stronger film and more tightly scripted (some of the references and allusions are so subtle, it takes repeated views to really get them), and I definitely think \"Django\" could have been told in 90 rather than 165 minutes, I do not mind its length. Again, referring to the moral ambiguity, we see this evolve and move forward as new situations arise.On the acting front, Jamie Foxx is excellent and this is his best performance since \"Ray\", maybe ever. Leonardo DiCaprio falls short of his best work, but is still good. Christoph Waltz is the real gem here, much like he was in \"Inglourious\" -- why he does so few American films is a mystery. The most debatable performance seems to be on Samuel L. Jackson. I did not find him to be doing his best (I prefer him in \"Black Snake Moan\"), but others say this should have been his time to be recognized and awarded. I think opportunities passed before, and hopefully will not be overlooked again, but this was not it.Best Picture? No. Best Director? No. But I can definitely see Best Screenplay and it is great to see that Tarantino's best work has been in the last five years -- it makes me think whatever he touches next will (again) be gold.",

A lot of people were shocked and appalled by \"Pulp Fiction\" because we really felt those kills. It meant something when they happened.Same with Bridget Fonda's kill in \"Jackie Brown\". Absolutely stunning moment.My problem with \"Django Unchained\" is that the violence becomes generic. I can't believe I just wrote that. I couldn't believe I thought that about three-quarters of the way in.The joy of this movie is in that first hour with Christoph Waltz using his quick wits to get out of two huge jams. His charms are so effective that we let it go that it would be totally implausible for him and Django to have gotten out of those two pickles alive.And then the movie appears to be building us up to some kind of payoff that just isn't satisfying. It just sort of goes the way of most spaghetti westerns, with tons of people getting shot up real good, instead of being turned on its head in usual QT fashion.Perhaps one of the reasons for the generic, cartoonish violence towards the end is that we're not fully invested in Django as a character. Schultz is the character we gravitate towards and the only face we're watching up there no matter what shot he's in. Django never breaks free from being just a mythical creature of sorts.I thought Kerry Washington was wasted.I'm sorry, but this movie just doesn't have the gathering power from scene to scene the way \"Pulp Fiction\", \"Jackie Brown\" or the two Kill Bills did.This is OK QT, not great QT.",

An experienced moviegoer can always tell if the reviewer knows what he's talking about. But with Django unchained, that was such a horrible flick with sky high ratings, I just felt the urge to write down how disturbingly flawed and deeply deranged this movie is and not in a good way. It's been a long time since I have seen a good Tarantino movie. This era ended with his story and his part in Four Rooms. And after Kill Bill, things went downhill never to crawl back up. Every once in a while, Tarantino's flashy and expensive garbage is being spilled on theater screens all over the world, and the somewhat schizophrenic director surprisingly picks up even more fans along the dodgy way. I expected more from this movie, since I couldn't even sit through that dreary Inglorious bastards, so things had to get better. And yet, even though he had a perfect plot setting in a cruel time and place for black people in American history, he casted the still boyish looking I-must- be-the-bad-guy-in-that-movie DiCaprio who really gives his best to sell it but falls short, and you get yet another long term drug use flashback in a form of give-me-back-my-money drive-in movie, with an hour long boring film within a film - during the visit to Candie Land that starts with what can only be described as the first MMA fight ever held in a living room. In this openly racist movie, and not because of the excessive use of the n-word, whose star later promotes gun ban while making good money by shooting every white creature in this film that has sudden twists from serious to absurd, from grave to bizarre. Here we get a bad writing, bad music, bad casting, mediocre acting from an all-star cast and awful, awful direction. The dynamic sound makes you jump off your seat when someone slams the door on screen. How cheap is that? Well, the music was OK, but not for one playlist and certainly not for one western. You just can't mix Rio Bravo style songs and Elvis impersonator with modern rap music and get away with it. Unless your main character can spill buckets of blood with just one bullet or massacre crowds of armed rednecks just after practicing his gunslinger skills by shooting down a few bottles. We also see a drawer slide mounted Derringer save the day one time too many. We see black slaves speak fluent German. But this is a love story, and yet these extreme action scenes are the high tide here with tons of ketchup spills all around, with over the top gore that would make a B-slasher-movie look like British rom com, and the drab dramatic part will bore you to death and make you consider leaving the theater. Twice. What Quentin tries to achieve here, style wise, is the bleak mix of Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and Jesus Christ Superstar. But someone should've told him both movies are bad. Also, Samuel L. Jackson's pathetic make-up as well as his cartoonish role do not make things any better. I didn't expect to see Open Range, but this charade is a kind of rich gumbo, made out of all the bad ingredients from previous hyped Tarantino grindhouse style obsession movies or his dull WWII affirmative action fairy tale, that was oddly not enough spiced with finger licking good hot sauce from Leone, Hawks or Peckinpah, hence completely ruining this bad taste cinema and rendering it inedible. Now seeing these ratings, no wonder Gangnam style is the most viewed YT video ever. No wonder Hobit, Harry Potter, Batman, Spiderman and Lord of the Rings top the Best 250 list.",

            "content": "DJANGO UNCHAINED, Tarantino's spin on the spaghetti western genre, should rightly be called a southern rather than a western. It's an epic-length story about slavery and redemption in the southern states, featuring an ensemble cast and the kind of ultra-stylistic, ultra-violent gunplay that Tarantino has made a trademark all of his own. It's also one of Tarantino's most self-indulgent movies, coming third to the worst excesses of DEATH PROOF and KILL BILL: VOLUME 2.Like INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS before it, the ace up Django's sleeve is Christoph Waltz, once again delivering a subtle, softly-spoken and multi-layered turn that's reminiscent of his best work as Colonel Hans Landa. Waltz walks away with the movie; every scene in which he doesn't appear is noticeably the poorer for it, and Tarantino gets the very best from his German star. That's good, because the rest of the movie thinks it's better than it really is; the opening and ending are both strong, but the middle is very saggy, lacking in action, incident or any form of suspense or intrigue.It does pick up here and there with a couple of blistering action sequences in which Tarantino seems to have ploughed the grisly excesses of PLANET TERROR for inspiration, but even one of these is spoilt by Tarantino's insistence on including some jarring rap music on the soundtrack (a silly effort to pander to the young black male audience, and shameful considering the rest of the excellent, eclectic score). Then there's the lengthy dinner table scene that tries to outdo the one in BASTERDS but doesn't come close.Even with these detractions, this is still an entertaining movie, which is mainly thanks to Tarantino's skill in direction; he brings all of the drama, bloodshed and humour you'd expect to the tale. I'm no fan of Jamie Foxx but this is probably his best performance given that he plays it taciturn for the most part; Samuel L. Jackson walks away with a great minor role, and DiCaprio makes for a wonderfully slimy bad guy; you'll wonder why casting him as a villain wasn't considered previously. Tarantino's skill at casting familiar faces in minor roles (the likes of Dennis Christopher, James Remar and Franco Nero, for instance) is as good as ever, but I'll have to watch this film a couple more times to decide whether it's truly great or merely quite good.",

In America the advent of the TV western had pretty much killed off the big screen western, based on the notion that, why buy the milk when the cow is already in your living room? Meanwhile, in far-off Italy, a then-obscure director named Sergio Leone decided it would interesting to re-imagine the American western against an Italian backdrop. All the actors would speak Italian, which would later be dubbed over into the language of the country the film was playing in. Except for the main actor, who in this case was an ex-pat American named Clint Eastwood. Eastwood's TV series RAWHIDE had just cancelled and his career was effectively over. So,. when offered a few grand to be the only English-speaking actor in a \"spagetti western\" Eastwood agreed, and then forgot the experience. Until he later heard that the film, A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, had become the #1 film in Europe. But that is yet another story for yet another day... The original film DJANGO was one of the literally dozens of knock-offs of the Leone films, which (as said) were themselves knockoffs of American westerns. It starred Franco Nero, an Italian actor who spoke no English. It was hardly a prime example of the genre. It was hardly a prime example of anything. The more interesting story, a story that will fascinate film historians in the years and decades to come, is why one of the most honoured and respected film-makers on the planet today, a man whose work is actually studied in FILM SCHOOL, felt compelled to do a remake of one of the most forgettable films in the history of the medium...? This reviewer (who, by the way, considers Spagetti Westerns from the 60s a \"guilty pleasure\" - and has actually seen almost all of them in a real theatre, with a special preference for the ones starring Lee Van Cleef) could barely make it more than half way through Django Unchained, before being overcome by nausea and an overwhelming sense of loss for the way in which these resources might have been better deployed, perhaps in a parallel universe where \"QT\" is still able to pass an ink-blot test. Make no mistake. This is not fine film-making. This is a cry for help.",

            "content": "Deep in the South, several years prior to the Civil War, one professedly fought for the abolition of slavery, life as a black man is never easy. Thankfully for Django (Jamie Foxx), a suave German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) with an innate hatred towards slavery, requires his assistance to track down three outlaws 'dead or alive', thus liberating him from the hands of traders. Django soon discovers an close affinity towards the bloody craft of killing (as well as an indisputable knack for it), especially since he is being paid for whacking off white people. Schultz and Django inadvertently join forces, soon heaping a small fortune in dead bodies. Nonetheless Django's heart and mind is still focused on rescuing his beloved Brunhilda (Kerry Washington) from her employ at Candyland, run by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), who has a fascination and interest in Mandingo fighting.Another movie, another genre for Tarantino to pillage for inspiration and homaging. Functioning now as Hollywood's class clown, who admittedly has wide film knowledge, but whose interest is focused mainly on playing the funny-bone (and satisfying its blood craze in cartoonish violence) of his like-minded audience. \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" were great pictures in their own right, but somehow it felt like there is something more to the artist than just constant in-jokes and barrages of references. However ever since Tarantino has jumped from genre to genre, crossing off blaxploitation, Asian vengeance flicks, horrors and war movies from his 'to do' list. Now adding spaghetti westerns (with a solid helping of Frew Williamson inspired blaxploitation with a touch of Shaft references). Once truly awaiting for each new Tarantino movie, I must confess that my patience has seemingly wearied out, no longer intaking Tarantinesque prolonged banter and games at referencing. The class clown act seemingly works well for some time, but once you stay in this guise for too long without ever reinventing your jokes, just changing their context, the stop seeming as intellectually substantial.\"Django Unchained\" still is a throughly entertaining movie in its own right with the long runtime thankfully bearable without any exacerbation. This is owed mainly to three wickedly spectacular performances by Leonardo di Caprio, Samuel L. Jackson and the crowd favourite Christpher Walttz (plus a host of cameos which will be like candy for film buffs). However various aspects in the narrative are faulty, such as the somewhat needless drawing out of the story midway, the thinly justified plot surrounding the need to purchase a Mandingo fighter for an obscene amount of money in order to retrieve Brunhilda or the dimwitted 'opportunity' afforded to Django to escape capture from Candyland. Meanwhile Tarantino seems less interested in character coherency, than bringing about mindless bloodshed, hence when the collected and restrained Dr. Schultz decides to go against prior behaviour and consequently risk the death of both Django and Brunhilda, the best he has to say is: \"Sorry, I just couldn't help myself.\" Just so Tarantino, who seems less interested with the story, more in the spectacle: producing a glee moment, an obscure reference, witty dialogue.Nonetheless even in terms of spectacle \"Django Unchained\" falls pretty flat with regards to the genre Tarantino is obviously pastiching. No scene stands out as memorable (apart from maybe a Mandingo fight due to its wanton violence), despite some inspired performances. Nothing even comes close to the Sergio Leone's classic train station show-down or the shoot-out at the end of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\". And these are just some of the timeless scenes in classic Leone, Corbucci (or even Peckinpah - at least in terms of gratuitous violence) westerns. The best Tarantino could do was replicate screen titles from the Italian golden era and imitate the long runtime, but none of the tentative magic was carried. Spaghetti westerns may not have carried profound sub-textual messages, but they carry the standard of quintessential movie magic, which makes Tarantino trademark homage even more trivial to watch (albeit given the widespread admiration of his new movie I am obviously delivering a minority report). Profusely violent \"Django Unchained\" adds to Tarantino's egocentric homage collection, but despite his strong following and widespread critical appeal, it still seems like the amount of people just not finding his one-track creativity entertaining anymore is steadily expanding.",

            "content": "I was deeply disappointed by Django Unchained and constantly had to resist the urge to walk out. I didn't find it entertaining, it was too long, and I didn't find it altogether that funny or interesting to regard either. I know I'm in a minority and the films rapid ascent to the top 100 of IMDb no doubt will imbue Tarantino with the confidence to make three sequels to this film. I think that would be a terrible mistake. Tarantino's best film was Jackie Brown, and since then I think the quality of tightness of his films have gone downhill. They've become more self indulgent, more tongue in cheek, less biting, more reliant on shock and gratuitous violence than narrative intrigue. I actually found myself bored during Django, checking my watch periodically. Not a good sign, especially when talking about Tarantino- a man who seems destined to inoculate his audiences against boredom. The plot didn't hold my attention simply because it was a replica of so many plots that came before. Man sees girl, girl in danger, man saves girl. Never do we believe Django or the girl are ever actually in danger, so apparently Tarantino believes the one thing that will keep us glued to our seat is the expectation for more and more outrageous violence. I suppose he's right, and it's a sign of our times. I'm not a conservative type, and I have nothing against violence in movies. I don't, however, particularly enjoy violence for the sake of violence, and don't find a three hour long murder spree fun. I don't like Tarantino singling out innocent people and slaughtering them for fun (and believe me he tries hard to make it fun). Killing slave masters are one thing, but this film goes out of its way to kill the families of these people too. I don't find Django or the good Doctor Shulz heroic, or cool, or fun. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I've just grown up a little too much. Maybe I just don't know how to have fun anymore, the same way I don't sit for hours on end playing video games the way I did in high school. There's no point to it, and it bores me.",

            "content": "*This review contains SPOILERS.* I normally read the plot summary on IMDb before I watch a movie despite my feeling that it may give away plot details. With this movie, it was the other way round. Here's why. A freed slave in mid 19th century Texas, with the help of a bounty hunter, sets out to rescue his wife who is a slave at a plantation in Mississippi. The story doesn't get to this part till about an hour. I even wondered at some point if there was an angle where Dr.Schultz was going to double-cross Django and sell him off to some white guy. The bounty-hunting part is essential to the story but cut to the chase already! I felt chained to my seat as the movie dragged on forever. Christopher Waltz does a good job, but Dr.Schultz was badly written. He comes across as trying too hard to be funny and cool and his elaborate dialogues get annoying at times but despite all that, you end up liking him. Leonardo DiCaprio does a convincing job as the arrogant, rich, gore- loving plantation owner. He has evolved to the point where he can ease into any kind of role on screen and it is refreshing to see him as Calvin Candy. Watch out for Samuel L. Jackson. He is so good as Stephen that he frightens you, annoys you and makes you want to hate him. He is the highlight of the movie. Jackson and DiCaprio complement each other very well. Kerry Washington has a small role but does a decent job and plays Broomhilda well. Finally, Jamie Foxx/Django. I still have not been able to separate the actor and the character from each other. He is in a trance for most of the movie and transiently comes out of it in between to say a few words and kill people. His portrayal of a man desperate to get to his wife is just not convincing. His acting needs a lot more polishing, but Tarantino is no help because Foxx's portrayal of Django made me wonder if he is so bad an actor or if Tarantino messed up his acting. Hence, I can't separate Foxx from Django. The chemistry between Django and Broomhilda is conspicuous by its total absence. Even the girl who shows Django around when he goes to find the Brittle brothers has a few lines with him. After putting us through 165 minutes of torture anyway, couldn't Tarantino have filmed one scene showing Django and Broomhilda together (before they get separated)? Instead, all we get to see is Django helping Broomhilda escape early on in the movie and then imagining her all over the place. Just one scene of them sharing screen space (instead of the useless KKK scene) would have done the trick. No wonder Calvin doesn't suspect anything between the two of them. There is no show of emotion from Django when Dr.Schultz is killed. He just says a random, unemotional goodbye later when he collects Broomhilda's papers. So much for the man who freed him and helped him find his wife. The action scenes are a little too violent, but it is an action flick, so I'll let that pass. The cinematography is very good, editing terrible and music a little too modern for the time in which the movie is set. This was a good story with huge potential, but the abysmal writing, direction and editing made it a dud for me. If not for good acting by Jackson, DiCaprio, Schultz and the likes, 'Django Unchained' would have fallen flat. Undoubtedly, they are the saving grace of the film. The only good thing for us was that we checked the running time ahead and bought popcorn. Rent it out on DVD, it's not worth the admission fee.",

            "content": "I wanted to see this movie for two reasons: 1) I am a big music and movie fan of Jamie Foxx. 2) I wanted to know why Nate Parker turned the movie down and seemed so disappointed in the script when he did an interview on The Breakfast Club.I didn't know the movie was going to be 2 hours and 45 minutes long nor did I care. I am not a fan of Quentin Tarantino (although I like the John Travolta parts of \"Pulp Fiction\") but I knew I was going to hear the n-word a lot from watching an interview on \"BET's Don't Sleep.\" Didn't bother me. That's realistic terminology for that time period in slavery. I'm far more irritated by black folks who know the history and are brainwashed enough to think that the term has changed. I read several articles and interviews about how Leonardo Dicaprio had a hard time using the word, but he was playing a slaveowner. That word is a given. I'm a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and love quite a few Dicaprio flicks, too, so I thought, \"How could this be bad? Why didn't Nate Parker like the movie?\" This turned out to be the worst movie I've ever seen since \"Soul Plane.\" Comedic timing: Quentin Tarantino did a recent interview in Ebony magazine (Dec 2012) where he said, \"One of the characteristics of my work is that I make you laugh at f***** up s***.\" While there were people in the audience who laughed at random parts of the movie, I never cracked a smile. There's nothing funny to me about the Ku Klux Klan or their rambling about whether the eye holes are too short in their masks. The KKK is the most horrendous group in American history (in my opinion) and trying to make light of them seemed odd to me. Quentin Tarantino said, \"I haven't liked any of the representations of slavery that I've seen on film.\" Slavery isn't meant to be liked. It's meant to be documented. You're not supposed to laugh about it or make light of it or find some amusing cowboy entertainment. It's ugly. It's graphic. It's heavy. And I truly couldn't give a damn about a horse being able to do the robot.Field slave vs house slave: Judging from the amount of lashes on Django's back, I got the impression that he was a field slave. So why this guy who didn't appear to spend any amount of time inside anybody's slave quarters could speak perfect English and read and was this brown in complexion (complexion meant a helluva lot back then) seemed odd to me. It wasn't until he reached a bar that we started hearing broken English and him saying words he didn't understand but his vernacular was way too crisp. Jamie Foxx said Quentin Tarantino told him he needed to act like a slave. Django was someone I could see strolling down the street in 2012 -- just with outdated clothing on -- if you heard him speak.Black man on a horse: As hard as Quakers had to hide themselves from affiliation with the Underground Railroad and with the amount of covering up even after the Emancipation Proclamation, racism was more harsh, more violent and more impulsive. So how in the world this random black man could roll through town on a horse and not be shot dead before anybody even asked his comrade why he was there was beyond me. You know how you see action movies and think, \"This guy would be dead in three minutes if this was real life\"? That's how I felt about Django as soon as he grabbed the winter coat and boots.Leonardo Dicaprio and Samuel L. Jackson: These were the only two characters in the entire film who seemed realistic. Sam Jackson's character was definitely a house slave (and ironically enough he spoke English in a more broken manner than this obvious field slave Django). Dicaprio wasn't kidding when he said his character was horrible. There were moments when I flinched at some of the stuff his character smiled about, but I was finally starting to get into the film. Same for Sam Jackson.Kerry Washington: I just found it odd that she went from being in a box and splashed with water after being whipped and then walked around perfectly straight and graceful when she was pulled back into the mansion. While I understand why her character could speak German (she was another realistic house slave) and even why she seemed a bit more cultured than other slaves, I can't see someone being whipped and caged like an animal and then bopping around a dining room like nothing happened.Bounty hunter scenes: I get why there had to be a bounty hunter plot in order for the relationship to make sense and the rescue-the-wife part, but the bounty hunting scenes were so dreadfully boring. The movie didn't pick up until it started at Dicaprio's character's plantation.Music: Every time there was a serious scene, there was this obnoxious cowboy music or really upbeat music that contradicted what was going on. It's like playing a techno song in the middle of a guy getting raped in prison. The music never matched the scene. Has Tarantino ever heard of spirituals? Pick one.The entire film made a mockery of slavery and should've never used that topic. It was basically a cowboy movie with chains. And I hated it. And I'm incredibly annoyed that I ruined part of my Christmas evening paying $8 to see this stupid film.",

This is not the meta-trash he specializes in, this is just pure unadultered trash: no intelligence, no originality, no irony, no second layer of meaning, no redeeming grace.

SOLD!And yet there I was, sitting through the nerve-wracking theater-going experience that was \"Django Unchained\". How Tarantino moves from moments of white-knuckled tension to other moments of sheer hilarity and utter enjoyment just boggle the mind. He makes it seem so effortless, and at the same time hard to stomach. Watching this movie made me wonder what exactly attracted this man to such a, shall we say, unattractive subject as slavery. I mean, every single horrible aspect of the material is right there, in-your-face and highly unpleasant. Much of this movie (not even the violence, really, which was typically \"excessive-to-the-point-of-comical\" Tarantino) was hard to sit through, with Tarantino trading his his trademark \"f-bomb a minute\" for the \"n-bomb a minute\" dialogue. But that's what makes the ending so damn gratifying. To see the horrors of what Django has to go through (and the horrific world in which he lives) just makes it that much more satisfying when he finally shows up and delivers a serious dose of ass-kicking to all involved. Seemingly in spite of the uncomfortable subject, \"Django Unchained\" was a hell of a good time at the movies. I haven't laughed so hard in so long as I did during the \"bag\" scene (complete with unexpectedly hilarious Jonah Hill appearance). The violence is the fist-pumping sort, that of the crowd-pleaser variety. And it's one hell of a well-acted movie. Jamie Foxx lends a tortured badassery to the title role, while everyone from the supporting cast to Don Johnson is noteworthy. DiCaprio gives a deliciously unhinged performance (it's worth seeing, believe me). And Samuel L. Jackson plays a character of such despicability that it's nothing less than shocking. It took way too long for someone to kill that guy. But it's Christoph Waltz who makes this movie, for me. The guy is extraordinary. His wonderfully dark humor and playful delivery just made him a sheer pleasure to watch. I couldn't take my eyes off the man. He was electric. It might be my favorite performance in a Tarantino movie, though I haven't seen him in \"Inglorious Basterds\" yet. Almost three hours long, and definitely not a boring movie. I went in with high hopes, and wasn't disappointed. Just an incredible movie, harsher aspects and all. 8/10",

All of them focus on the theme of revenge. They all follow the same pattern. Long, extended scenes of characters talking, followed by a scene of violence. Characters talking again, followed by yet another scene of violence. As a result, his films just feel formulaic and typical now. I noticed how online everyone is praising the acting. Jamie Foxx is passable as django, but surprisingly Christopher waltz has received the most amount of praise. I don't know why. He plays the exact same character like he did in inglorious basterds, only this time he is a good character. All the other actors were passable as well, I guess, but they weren't anything to write at home about. The shootouts in this film, yes, they are quite spectacular and well done, but they are the only parts of the film that are worth watching.

In fact some said it was one of the best movies they had ever seen. Critics have been raving and audiences have been bubbling and now awards all over the place. Django is a great film. Its a revenge western done the only way Tarantino does it, exploitative, insane violence with a 70's Grindhouse vibe. It fits the bill in every way. You can't say you didn't know what you were in for if you know Tarantino. Its well done and its entertaining and stylish in his style. I actually hoped this would be a huge ten for me because I do love Tarantino though I only discovered him in the last ten years or so. As good as it was, I had some issues. I hate saying a film is too long because I love every second I spend in a theatre but it was a massive three hours long. It could have easily been split into two in the same vein as Kill Bill was. That being said I give him kudos for not milking a film the way so many series are nowadays. Still I think with some better editing, the film could have been chopped ever so slightly and still kept its integrity. I found a certain issue with the plot as to why Django and the Doc went through such elaborate hoops to trick Candie instead of offering him a ridiculous amount to buy Django's wife. I know I'm not the only one bothered by this plot from the IMDb boards. And finally I felt like Jamie Foxx's lead performance of the title character lacked something. He didn't feel like the hero or anti-hero. He wasn't quite as bad-ass as I expected and with two or three really exceptional performances, Foxx felt less than stellar.Jamie Foxx plays Django. He's a former slave who has been beaten and mistreated. He is supposed to be dark and brooding and he is that but sometimes he plays it too much because he seems almost monotoned and almost boring. Yes he has some scenes where he really steps up and blows away his enemies but he doesn't really shine in his role and its too bad. Foxx is an amazing actor but I felt like he missed the opportunity to really impress. I wanted more Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name or something like that. Now for the absolutely amazing performances. Christoph Waltz is scene stealing. He is truly outstanding as the intelligent smooth talking Dr. King Schultz. He deserves his Oscar nod and proves once again in a Tarantino film how great he is at making his character come to life. I like Leonardo DiCaprio, you can't deny his outstanding career, but he truly blew me away in this film. He is just simply outstanding in his role as the quick talking businessman and pseudo villain Calvin Candie. This is easily one of the best roles I have ever seen him in. The scenes with him and Waltz are magic and some of the best chemistry I've seen on screen in a long time. Samuel L. Jackson, who does everything, actually really shines in this film. He is deliciously bad and you'll love to hate his maniacal and grouchy old Stephen. Combine the three of them and you'll have the three best characters in a 2012 film hands down. Kerry Washington is decent as Broomhilda. She fits her character well but never really impresses. She is just there to fill the plot point and she does that. The supporting cast are terrific too including some stand out performances from Don Johnson, Tom Wopat and M.C. Gainey.I knew as I watched the film that it was boiling up to an all out blood splattering revenge battle and it fulfilled that 120%. No one does blood splattering revenge like Tarantino. He certainly shows a lot of style in the film and the cinematography is well done. It shows from the typical western town to a southern plantation. Much has been said about the racist content of the film but it is a product of its time. That being said I don't think there is a lot of true history behind this story. I still don't feel that it showed racism in a positive light by any means and considering the black slave is the one who literally rips every single person apart in the end...I think he gets his vengeance. If you love Tarantino then you'll be pleased with Django Unchained. It is epic in every proportion and while not a perfect ten in my books, it certainly gets honourable mention at being stylish and entertaining through and through. 9/10",

The movie was far too long for what was on offer (not that much) and the ending seemed to be a 20 minute add on to meet blood and gore quotas and nothing more. As regards acting, this movie should leave a few of the famous thinking like Silvester Stallone after he made Rhinestone. I understand he basically paid to have that movie taken out of circulation. Samuel Jackson, in particular, may soon be doing the same. His role was far from sympathetic, but made worse by overacting. Don't give up the day job Quentin.",

            "content": "The movie isn't a Western. The film starts out in pre civil war South, several male slaves are chained and being transported. Among the slaves is Django play by Jamie Foxx who has been sold away from his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). The slave owners then encounter Dr. King Schultz play by Christoph Waltz, a German immigrant dentist and bounty hunter. Schultz takes Django from them revealing that he sought out Django to aid him in identifying the Brittle brothers, a trio of ruthless killers. The two come to an agreement: in exchange for helping locate the Brittles, Schultz will free Django from slavery and help him get his wife Broomhilda from the current owner Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie by posing as potential buyers of a Mandingo slave fighter. The reason Dr, Shultz helped Django is because he was moved by his story and felt obligated to help because of the German legend of Siegfried and Broomhilda. Schultz would introduces Django as a free man and an expert on Mandingo fighting. Django raises the suspicions of Candie's staunchly loyal house slave, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), who correctly deduces that Django and Broomhilda know each other, and that the Mandingo sale is a ruse. A lot of films inspiration Quentin Tarantino to make this movie. One inspiration for the film is Sergio Corbucci's Django, whose star Franco Nero has a cameo in this film. Other inspiration are the 1970's films Mandingo, and the Great Silence. The costumes of the film were also references from works such as Thomas Gainsborough's 1770 oil painting Blue Boy, 'Big Daddy' Don Johnson Miami Vice white vanilla suit, King Schultz's Kojak like chinchilla coat, Broomhilda's Ida Galli's dress style from Blood for a Silver Dollar and Calvin Candie's costume came partly from Rhett Butler from 1930's Gone of the Wind. Quentin also has a kicking soundtrack, ranging from Elisa Toffoli 'Ancora Qui', Beethoven's Fur Elise, Dies Irae from Verdi's Requiem to modern hits from Tupac, John Legend, & Rick Ross. I can do without the Rick Ross. Rick is an overweight, rapping, misogynist who raps about gang violence and drug sales that has nothing to do with slavery. Few of the rap songs that played kind of took my brain out of the time period. For me, in terms of dialogue, it outmatches even Pulp Fiction, it's not just clever and ironic, it's gripping and brilliantly paced. One of the best dialogue scenes focus on Calvin Candie with the skull talking to both Dr. Shultz and Django. Like Dr. Schultz, I Couldn't Resist finding out that, when Leo punches the table & breaks the glass, he actually gashed his hand open while filming that scene and just kept going. You could tell that Kerry was taken aback when he wiped the blood all over her face. It was his real bloody hand. The acting is brilliant. Waltz and Dicaprio outdid themselves. The blood and violence can be over the top at times. The violence was gawdy, the squibs used were over the top, even for a gory movie, its a caricature of his passed films, in a very horrible manner. Jamie Foxx as Django was OK as the hero, but I felt the character became way too dark in the end of the film. Not only he lost most of his humanity when Dr. Shutlz force him to kill the farmer, but also bossing around the other slaves. Honestly, I know it's a cover within Candyland, but it's seems Ray Charles was just there to shot white people in the face in revenge show in the film by killing Candie's sister. Also with enough bullets, you can get what you want. Like freedom, equality, and slight remnants of civil liberties. Martin Luther King's civil disobedience doesn't go anywhere. I felt that to be wrong message being sent out. Django true enemy is Samuel L. Jackson's Stephen. Pure gold in funny one liners, Jackson stole the show as the character is so damn racist. Stephen is an angrily self hating black man, whom disassociates himself from other African American. The Uncle Tom character in this film. Some people have complained about it saying the 'N' word too much, but I have to imagine back then it was just a commonplace word; I didn't feel like the movie was using it excessively or in poor taste. Still, I'd say that Tarantino was actually uncharacteristically sensitive to race in this film. I reject criticize that it disrespects black ancestors because it has some comic elements. On the contrary, I believe that it is the lack of discussion about horrors of slavery that hurts black history. I think more slavery movie should be made and Tarantino somewhat brings light to a sour subject here. There were scenes in the movie that gave audience members a hard time to take in and somewhat painful to watch. Firstly, that is not a slavery movie, but a love story and a western spaghetti that occurred during slavery time, it's might seem like a pro black film, but it's for real moviegoers who love stories. Quentin was dynamite directing and writing this. This movie was a montage of everything you would ever want in a movie. It's three hours long, but it's go through you fast. If you haven't seen it yet, I'd recommend it.",

This piece by Tarantino is one of his finest works ever, \"Django: Unchained\" is set to become an all time classic.There are so many things about this movie that are great. For starters, as in any Tarantino movie, the attention to detail of the characters is spot on. Every character you meet has a name, a certain or several traits (the way they talk or dress or act) and is from the bottom to the top extremely well thought out. He has said so himself that it is by his characters that he will be remembered, and for sure there are some memorable ones here. Django, the main character played by the all cool Jamie Foxx, a former slave turned bounty hunter travels with the mysterious dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz, played outstandingly my Christoph Waltz, winning him his second Oscar, in his second tarantino movie! Together they embark on an unforgertable journey trying to rescue Django's lost wife, Broomhilda.The movie stands at 159 minutes long, and that's a long time for a story not that long. The reason is that every single scene is so adequately put together. Though the sceens might seem long and dull, they are infact the opposite of that. Firtst and foremost, they slowly build up a tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat during the entire scene, to finally explode into something extraordinary. And that is what makes Tarantino's scenes so special. You sit there waiting for something to happen, and sometimes nothing will, other times all hell breaks loose. That is the brilliance of Tarantino movies, their unpredictability to rupture at any moment. Lets not forget to mention the, as usual, unprecedented and marvelous dialogues, it is the biggest reason why his movies work, and does not become a dull and boring fairy tale.What this movie particularly shines in is all of those things, but especially in story telling. The story is un-heard of and definitely a one of a kind. The lovely friendship between Dr. Schultz and Django, but more than that, the astounding character developement of Django from insecure and scared to bad ass and serene, is a delight to watch.In the end, this movie goes out Tarantino-style; Double-up! It's an ending sure to bombard and rumble as well as satisfy and surprise the viewer. This is one for the history books. Hats off to you, Monsieur Tarantino!",

To some extent it's his most \"normal\" movie, with in-order storytelling and no narration, but the camerawork, dialogue, and over-the-top violence scream Tarantino. Everything in this movie is perfect. There's plenty of action, comedy, and drama. I think it uses its length better than his other movies. Hollywood and Pulp Fiction felt rather long, but despite the fact that Django features an extended dinner conversation, the intensity of the movie never drops. It's incredibly engaging. The dialogue is incredible, with plenty of callbacks and clever humor. This movie has dozens of quotable moments, including the hilarious raid scene. The Brittle Brothers flashback is utilized perfectly. The performances are amazing. Waltz's Oscar is well-deserved, but honestly Leo might be the best here. His portrayal of Calvin is scary and cunning, and I love that the blooper with his hand getting injured was kept in the movie. I wish there was an Oscar for best villain. Samuel L. Jackson is great as always, and Jamie Foxx nails the title role. Watching him get progressively more confident is so fun to watch. The use of Ennio Morricone's music is brilliant as well. Most importantly, this movie is probably the best example of one of my favorite parts of Tarantino's movie. I don't really like watching movies based on a true story because usually the truth is depressing and disappointing. Tarantino is more of an optimist and features movies that ask \"what if history went right?\" Inglorious and Hollywood are great examples as well. Django is an inspiring story that's so satisfying.",

Jamie foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Christopher Schultz all do amzing jobs playing thier characters and I loved every bit of them being on screen.The movie follows Django. A free slave turned bounty hunter off on a quest to save his wife, who is being held in another plantion. Aided by Dr. King Schultz, a dentist turned bounty hunter. Django must work with Dr Schultz if he ever wants to see his wife again.The beginning is very fast paced and gets to the point quick. Django is freed. He learns that dr Schultz is a bounty hunter and Django gradually opens up to the idea of being one himself.By the middle of the movie Django is getting to be pretty good with a gun. They devise a plan to get his wife from a plantion called candy land. This is where we meet my most hated movie villain of all time. Calvin Candie. This guy is the embodiment of evil. He takes joy in seeing two slaves fight or what he calls \"Mandingo fighting\" and is down right sadistic to his slaves. We also meet Samual Jackson's character, Stephen. Stephen works in the house and is suspicious of Django and Dr. King Schultz. When they are about to buy Django's wife and free her. Stephen revels thier plan and tells Calvin all about them. After being yelled at by Calvin he decides to give them Djangos wife. And as he goes in to shake Dr. King Schultz hand. The good dr remembers how when they arrived he saw a slave being ripped apart by dogs. He kills Calvin and is himself, killed. Django gets into a shootout killings a lot of calvins goons. And by the end surrenders himself and is put to be sold and this is the part in the movie where I was wondering. Where can it go form here......oh boy it went places I didn't even THINK OF!The ending parts are very, very amazing. Django gets free by tricking some slavers. He rides to candy land and kills the rest of Calvin's family thier. We learn that Stephen, who had a limp throughout the film. Was faking it in order to not be put to work in the fields.

            "content": "Here it comes, Quentin Tarantino's new blockbuster and Italo Western homage \"Django Unchained\". Personally, I happen to find Tarantino's movies quite a mixed bag as he has done anything from stupid disaster pieces such as \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\" up to very thought out stuff like \"Inglorious Basterds\". His new movie is among the better ones he has released but still not the best.What I immediately liked about the movie is the camera work with many wide angles, natural Stillleben and shots on the eyes of the actors to capture their emotions. If you like directors like Sergio Leone, you will know what I'm talking about and if you happen to like him, you will also adore this movie. The opening scene presenting the cast already gets you into an old school western atmosphere. The amazing soundtrack is another strong point all along this movie. After some very explicit scenes, Tarantinos puts a vivid and catchy track that grabs your attention and makes it easier to digest what you've just seen. Tarantino certainly has a good feeling for impressive settings and gripping atmospheres.He puts a lot of details in his movie once again but only good connoisseurs may detect all of them. In one scene, the new Django Jamie Foxx sits next to a bar and an old guy who spoke Italian asks him his name and how it's spelled. Well, this old guy is Franco Nero who portrayed Django for the very first time and that's what makes this scene so funny as he knows off course how this name is spelled. If you recognize Franco Nero, you will laugh out loud during that scene, anybody who doesn't know him may just find that scene overlong and strange. A similar event happens towards the end when Tarantino appears himself as an actor which is another funny moment.In general, this movie has a lot of humour once again that contrasts the long dialogues as well as the detailed killing scenes. This aspect works very well thanks to the acting of Christoph Waltz who is just amazing and incredibly diversified. He's not as great as in \"Inglorious Basterds\" but comes very close and would deserve one more Academy Award for his acting in my opinion. That being said, the actors simply do an incredible job in this film. Jamie Foxx is a quite diversified character and one really cares about his fate until the end of the movie which is very important. Samuel L. Jackson plays a great villain and does it in a very credible way. Leonardo DiCaprio happens to play in more and more dark and mature films and convinces once again as unpredictable maniac.This being said, everything about this movie seems to be perfect but one very important thing is missing: the story. The movie has no twists or surprises and also includes many lengths after a strong beginning and just before an explosive ending. These lengths include the scenes on the way to Candie Land or several dialogues inside the mansion. These scenes are only saved by the strong acting by Waltz, Jackson and Co. but would ruin a movie if they were done by average actors. This movie would have been much more fluid if it was cut down to two hours of running time. The original Italo Westerns like \"Once Upon A Time In The West\" had better story lines and a few mysterious characters that would only reveal their true intentions in the very end that are missing in this modern adaption.Nevertheless, apart of the story line and the lengths, this movie is a definite must see and lovely done homage to the era of Italo Westerns. Any fan of Tarantino should be satisfied with this flick even if it's not his best and even if there were a couple of better movies than this one in 2012.",

And, he's been doing that ever since he finished the respectable Reservoir Dogs (1992), his best attempt at making movies.The storyline synopsis on the main page is sufficient to get the main theme. Instead, let me present a few points that make this effort as Tarantino's worst effort so far, imo (he is consistent though \u2013 each successive movie has been progressively worse than the previous).First, it's supposed to be satire, but it degenerates into campy excess, throughout. Second, the gratuitous violence is simply bizarre, especially the bloodbath in the third act. Third, the treacly, anachronistic, overly loud sound track is boring, distracting and just plain stupid. Finally, and worst of all, a topic about slavery in the Deep South doesn't deserve to be presented like one of Ed Wood's failed projects (and I'm denigrating Mr Wood by saying that).I should add, also, that the movie was at least an hour too long. On the plus side, the filming, editing and special effects are okay.However, there have been much better movies about slavery in USA, beginning with Birth of a Nation (1915), then Gone with the wind (1939), Mandingo (1975) and others.Don't waste your time and money to see DU. I didn't pay a dime, not a cent. But I did waste 165 minutes of my life.Give this 2 out of 10. Not recommended, period.",

From the explanation to the Marshall why King killed the Sheriff, to the facing screen explanation of a slave camp by Jackson near the finale. Ir's all electric stuff and is as good, if not better than what he has done before.Again, one thing the director can do, is get performances from actors like no one else.Dicaprio has never been better than he is in this, his Candie one of the most colourful and sadistic of Tarantino characters I have ever seen, and Jackson too, funny and Scary in equal measures, it's a shame the Academy hasn't recognised him for this, it's his best performance.Waltz is on a par with Inglorious, and ironically Foxx is the weakest link here, having the blandest dialogue, and not really owning the film until Candie and King are long gone.The action is intense, and the final act in the house is well worth sitting through the run time.And this is one of the films biggest problems, it's way too long. we have a 105 minute cracking movie about vengeance, with an hour of bothersome exposition thrown in. Yes, we like the references to everything exploitation, but those movies didn't feel like a chore every now and again.Then we have the obligatory director cameo, which is terrible, and ruins the flow of the film slightly.Other than that, it's still a great movie, with some career best performances and dialogue that is too die for.",

            "content": "In 1858, a bounty-hunter named King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) seeks out a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) and buys him because he needs him to find some men he is looking for. After finding them, Django wants to find his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who was formerly sold. With the help of the German bounty-hunter, the freed slave sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal plantation-owner (Leonado DiCaprio) in Mississippi. There they will take on a tough rival and his underlings (Samuel L. Jackson, Walton Goggins, Dennis Christopher , James Remar) . Life, liberty and the pursuit of vengeance. This Christmas, Django is off the chain. The \"D\" is Silent. Payback Won't Be.It is an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the starring and enemies . The film blends violence , blood , shootouts and it is fast moving, though overlong. There's high body-count with the bloody attacks where Django and King Schultz cause cruel slaughters, and , of course , the final showdown at the house. There are frantic scenes that are often intercut with a character taking their time and behaving methodically . The highlights of the film are the successive confrontations of our two protagonists against a series of outlaws to win the rewards on their heads and the overwhelming final in which starring does a real massacre . Django is named as homage to \u00a8Django Reinhardt\u00a8 , the famous American musician who introduced his particular guitar . There are special remembrances to Leone's Westerns , thus: \u00a8Fistful of dollars\u00a8, \u00a8Fistful of dolars more\u00a8and \u00a8The good, ugly and evil\u00a8 regarding various scenes and of course , Sergio Corbucci Westerns as \u00a8Navajo Joe\u00a8, \u00a8The great silence\u00a8, \u00a8Compa\u00f1eros\u00a8 and \u00a8the Mercenary\u00a8. And of course \u00a8Django\u00a8 (1966) with Eduardo Fajardo, Loredana Nusciak and Franco Nero himself , that followed a number of unofficial sequels , rip-offs , and copies .\u00a8Django\u00a8(1966) is a classic and violent Spaghetti Western with numerous imitations , in fact it was prohibited in various countries for its violence , for example , in England , but in France , Germany was a real hit and in Japan there is one \u00a8Fondazione Django\u00a8 too .Django Unchained (2012) displays an enjoyable cinematography by cameraman Robert Richardson who does an excellent photography with barren outdoors , dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and gorgeous exteriors from New Orleans, Louisiana, Whitney Plantation, Louisiana, Independence, Santa Clarita, Lone Pine, Abana Hills, California, among others . As always Tarantino uses pre-recorded music for his films, here taking \u00a8Django\u00a81966 music from Luis Enrique Bacalov (author of \u00a8The Postman and Pablo Neruda\u00a8 which won an Oscar and composed lots of Spaghetti) , creating a good soundtrack with Ennio Morricone influence .This cult movie was competently directed by Quentin Tarantino who often uses an unconventional storytelling device in his films and often shows a relationship between an older experienced character and a younger character in a manner similar to a parent or teacher .His films usually subvert cliches of certain genres and often pay a homage to genres that were highly popular in the 1960s and 1970s such as Heist (Reservoir Dogs), Blaxploitation (Jackie Brown), Kung Fu (Kill Bill), and Spaghetti Western (Django Unchained) Quentin has helmed several critically and financially successful films, including Reservoir Dogs (1992) , Pulp Fiction (1994) , Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill: Vol 1 (2003), Kill Bill: Vol 2 (2004), Inglorious (2009) and The Hateful Eight (2015). Rating : 7.5/10 . The movie will appeal to Tarantino enthusiasts and Western fans . Essential and indispensable watching.",

            "content": "Even though I am, and will forever remain, a diehard and devoted Quentin Tarantino fan-boy, I can't deny there's a disturbingly unnerving trend noticeable in his 5 latest movies. QT used to be inimitable and downright iconic for two specific trademarks, namely dialogues that are pure genius and sudden outbursts of extreme & uncompromising violence. Since \"Death Proof\" the dialogues only seemed to get longer and longer, while the violent bits became less numerous. Or at least that was the impression I got. When I first saw \"Django Unchained\", in the cinema when it was released, I thought the talkative parts were so overlong that I didn't even bother to write a review for it. But after the even more talkative \"The Hateful Eight\" and the exaggeratedly - almost exclusively - talkative \"Once Upon in Hollywood\", \"Django Unchained\" suddenly didn't seem so bad anymore.In fact, it's great! Already thought it was great the first time around, but I was too preoccupied with the length of the dialogues. But, in essence, it's another genuine and bona fide Tarantino, meaning it's an intelligent hodgepodge of genres and chock-full of delightful cinematic homages (to known classics as well as obscure gems) and an unbelievably stellar cast (featuring cult & western icons from the past four decades). Quentin must have been thrilled about his collaboration with Christoph Waltz in \"Inglourious Bastards\", and the very first casting of both Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio were also both tremendous successes. There still isn't a single other director who provides a soundtrack so suitable for a film. There also aren't any other directors that find the exact right balance between visual style, humor and excessive violence. But there were, say, \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Kill Bill\" were basically 100% perfect, \"Django Unchained\" shows quite few little cracks, and those cracks grew out to become enormous craters by the time of \"Once upon a time in Hollywood\", and that's most unfortunate.",

The movie was very good and had just the perfect amount of western style inclusion but for most people I think they expected more in addition to the amount of drama. The movie showed how crucial the slavery of black people was but didn't show how crucial it was for the other blacks (other than him and his wife and couple of others) and this was very disappointing taking into consideration how long the movie was. I think the movie should've been also count as a drama and an action.

When Django jumps on a horse bareback, with no bridle and rides off with the horse under total control over the horse, that about did it for me. How phony can you get! It went downhill fast from there turning a sort of interesting movie into a cartoon. I shoot in competition and I wish I could shoot 1/10th as good as Django. My goodness. The first time he shoots a gun(a rifle), it's a 200 yard shot at a guy on a running horse, .....and he hit him! And he shoots from the hip (not really taking aim) and never misses! How anybody could give this movie high marks is a real wonder. And at the end, when he ride his horse like he was trained for the circus, I just cracked up.",

Was it the spaghetti western style? Not the best one in that area either. The satirical portrayal of some characters or situations? The movie has its funny moments, but with all of my generosity I could not call it a comedy nor a satire. And then it struck me. Profanity. Profanity spiced with a few jokes and the right dose of blood spatter. Thinking back to his previous work I started to see the pattern. This recipe seems to be very successful with the audience. Why not give the masses what they want, right? That one worked for Rome too. At least for a while.

If you are sensitive to the use of the N word, this might not be something you should watch, because it reportedly gets dropped over 110 times. The actors were completely mesmerizing, with Leonardo DiCaprio outshining all of them with one simple scene. I was very happy to see Christoph Waltz play a character that didn't scare the crap out of me but by no means did that make him a soft guy in the movie. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with a perfect balance of old-timey music and newer music. The song \"Freedom\" is the best, because it sounds like a slave song but written in modern times and I love jamming out to it. Absolute, hands down, 10/10!!!Tip: DO NOT MAKE THIS INTO A DRINKING GAME IF YOU DON'T WANT ALCOHOL POISONING.

            "content": "This movie showcases Quentin Tarantino's love of spaghetti westerns, then skewed and presented in his own idiosyncratic, post-modern manner. Queue modern black music, awash with hip hop, gospel, soul, and funk, impeccable costumes, fine performances all round, and wonderfully lit cinematography. The film has Tarantino's gift for meticulous detail, funny dialogue, and colourful action.Christoph Waltz plays his part with great charm, in a manner all to similar to his Inglourious Basterds routine, but with written with less flesh to round out his character. Jamie Foxx, the titular hero, is sidelined and outplayed by his sidekick, and everyone else in the movie, but he has little to work with, simply playing the quiet, surly ex-slave, driven only by the spirit of anger. Leonardo DiCaprio's pomp is fairly entertaining, but his character serves only to drive the story along, and serve as a vindictive and cruel villain, because that is what the story demands. Still DiCaprio throws himself in and plays with the usual intensity and enthusiasm that he has shown himself capable of the millennium. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic, spewing his vitriol, with remarkable restraint and tenacity.But despite the amazing production, the cool soundtrack, and terrific performances; the movie remains indulgent and overlong. The quick snap of Tarantino's script is gone, the funny cultural references replaced by trite verbosity, and junior school social history. Opening titles tell us the year the movie takes place, thankfully explaining its two years before the American Civil War, because: bless our ignorance. Much dialogue serves only to create a tenuous link between characters or propagate the story, with Tarantino uncharacteristically falling onto formula to weave his story. But what really makes this film terrible is the lack of moral direction. Violence is served to remind us of its shocking nature, or it is shot to titillate us, spouts of blood gushing through gunfights. And Tarantino seems completely unaware of this contradiction. He shows us that bad people use violence and it is bad, and good people use violence, but this is righteous, as if to say whatever the question; only violence is the answer. Where it is used to shock us, the audience was sent in to an uneasy silence, as we are reminded of a terrible period in our past, but just as it seems like he is starting to deliver a message about the state of society, he instead showers us with blood, and the full glory of cinematic violence, and how the characters profit from it.The film is all guns and bluster, but only to disguise the emptiness of this exercise.",

            "content": "Tarantino at his most epic (as said by some) defeats for me the whole point. Overlong and sloppily put together, the film mainly suffers from Tarantino's specific philosophy, or lack of one. He is a writer first, writes frothy scenes of some tension but never pays mind to the submerged undercurrents of soul, the actual life that give rise to the tension, and then separately pulls visual skin from several places to dress his short sketches, films, music, cool tidbits of pop culture. At its best, this can create a narrative energy that carries you along, it's infectious in short spurts. This time, he has delivered the sketches in the form of the western he has long threatened to make, in this case Italian. I have seen most of the spaghetti westerns he takes from, probably all. These differed from their American counterparts in a key way\u2014the stories were not about a clean sweep of destiny from one coast to the other, because Italians wouldn't know Kansas City from Santa Fe, which liberated them to do a sort of abstract comic opera of the West. Films like Django were all about the visual sketch and archetype, entirely about the image of the man dragging the coffin. The sensibility goes back to centuries of comedia dell'arte, an appreciation for mannered masked life, episodic gaffe and irony, countered in the films with the rustic simplicity of the western. Being a writer first, few of Tarantino's episodes are visually thought out, the effect is nothing like Good Bad Ugly or Grand Silencio, where wry humor or absurd violence is chiseled to rise out of silence with the cicadas. In tandem with this is my main complaint. By all means, have the frothy patter, it's Tarantino's staple and one he is good at. But he is simply unable to visually integrate his wordplay with images, just can't do it, probably he doesn't even think it is an issue, or it's how movies work. In the film, you have individual scenes anchored on the spot in some kind of bartering going on, and wholly separate visual interludes, usually a montage of cool music video shots played over to music of his choosing. These are entirely independent of anything, sloppily slathered from the outside; blood spraying on cotton, slow-motion riding and shooting. It's such a sloppy way to make a film, sloppy like the man we see in interviews. There is not a single image here I will carry with me. Which wastes Waltz and Jackson putting on an excellent show, and to a lesser extent Foxx.And of course, all filmmakers reach out and borrow, Tarantino's problem is that he borrows fashions and what is incidentally attached to it, never the inner logic, the notion of life a certain way that on the outer level is the image we see. Let me illustrate this in the film. Django being a slave, in order to freely go about in the slaveholding South he has to be in disguise, Dr. Schultz tells him to pick out his costume and character. The rough-hewn ex-slave picks a frilly Little Lord Fauntleroy costume, and we get the silly image of him on horseback.How about instead of Fauntleroy for a quick snicker, Don Quixote? And borrow with the costume the logic of self-deception, and patiently mold and weave this through the film. Foxx in his pointy beard, and sculpted intense face does look the part, a black Quixote on heroic adventure. Schultz as his Pancha, an educated Pancha who 'writes' him into the story. I'm just throwing ideas. Instead of simple scattershot amusement, something that more deeply involves. And take this in a million directions. And visually distort truth, and fool with Southern chivalry and have us question the heroism. How about a Broomhilda as Dulcinea who doesn't know anything about him, but goes along because it means freedom? How about this as love, meeting someone that sets you free?I'm not saying this will be deep because in itself the theme is something, or it references a respectable work. It can be deep, in the sense that you more deeply involve more of us in the viewing. Tarantino has grown, but only the size of his canvas\u2014a small view stretched to epic length.",

He sets up an intriguing if wildly implausible premise, a nattily dressed ex-dentist has become an expert bounty hunter who makes his money killing the uneducated white trash of the pre-Civil War south. And the dentist doesn't embrace slavery and has a soft spot for slaves.Christoph Waltz plays this part with aplomb and fits perfectly into Tarantino's uniquely paced scenes and dialogue, handling what would otherwise be impossibly wordy expositions as if he always spoke that way.And so the movie begins and we're taken through a few scenes showing the dentist's perfect poise and implausible shooting accuracy. He frees a slave (Django) and forms a relationship with him and initially we aren't sure what direction the film will go.Unfortunately, with the stage set, this is about where it starts to come off of the rails. Tarantino's fetish for completely over the top violence was originally his signature but now is a stain on his films. He approaches the border of addressing \"adult\" topics and conflicts such as racism, slavery, cultural issues, or a great showdown between two prominent characters, and seems able to immerse himself in these issues to understand them well enough to portray them on the screen. But like a 14 year old who would rather play video games than do his homework, he quickly pulls the plug on any serious story telling and descends into mindless splatter- filled violence which, once started, can only increase through the rest of the film until it reaches a disgusting big red goopy climax. Slaves eaten by dogs, slaves killing each other with hammers, men wailing in pain after being shot or crushed, 20+ person shoot- outs with red paint coating every visible surface... it's hard to watch and doesn't tell a story or really do anything for the viewer, it's just self-indulgent nonsense.Tarantino clearly has talent in coming up with good story ideas, providing viewers with an immersive experience into other times and places, and attracting great actors and getting great performances out of them. It's too bad it's all wasted on his mental masturbations.I can't help but to wonder about the people calling this movie a \"masterpiece\" and wonder if they have ever actually seen a good movie or read a good book. If watching a movie just to see 100 people graphically killed and dismembered before your eyes is your idea of supreme entertainment then maybe you should think again.",

            "review_title": "An entirely satisfying and quintessentially Tarantino film",
            "content": "In this his seventh feature film, Quentin Tarantino has made it very clear what he's all about. The auteur's hallmarks litter the frames of \"Django Unchained,\" the closest he's come to making a film in the style of his favorite genre (arguably, but it's not really a contest) \u2014 the Spaghetti Western.Watching \"Django,\" it's clear how comfortable Tarantino is behind the camera in this Southern-set Western environment and with the characters he has created/molded based on his many influences. It would be a surprise to learn that this film was anything but one of the easiest filmmaking experiences of his career from a creative standpoint. He's a master of genre filmmaking, of giving his audience exactly what it wants (and at this point his fans exactly what they expect), and \"Django\" is consequently a breeze to watch.Jamie Foxx plays the titular hero, a slave who in the film's opening is purchased somewhat violently by the German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). The two strike a deal that if Django helps him track down and secure the bounty of three men whom only he can identify, Schultz will not only give him a cut, but help him find and rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). In the process, Schultz trains Django to be a good shot and a quick draw.It's Schultz who dictates pace and tone of the first half of the film, however, not Django. Just as he did for Tarantino in \"Inglourious Basterds,\" Waltz dominates every scene he's in during this first act, dancing loquacious circles around all the other actors and using his charm and wit to turn the tension and conflict into putty. He's not as impressive as he was in that Oscar- winning role, but that could easily be attributed to the fact that his character is a good guy, not malevolence in its purest form.Django as a character comes into his own in the final act of the film when all the cards are on the table, or as would be more appropriate to say in a Tarantino film, the you-know-what hits the fan. That's not even a semi-spoiler, by the way, because it's Tarantino's M.O. \u2014 you know not to panic if you're over two hours in and there hasn't been all that much bloodshed. Anyway, Foxx thrives when Django is finally \"unchained,\" but he's written rather curiously until then. His motives are simple enough (love and vengeance) and being a former slave the sympathy card is in play from the first shot of the film, but he's not written to be the most likable of heroes. He's a quiet partner for much of the movie who begins to slowly speak up more, and the things he has to say are brash and frankly a bit cocky. It's clear he'd rather start shooting sooner than talk, which will make you antsy up until the trigger gets pulled, in both a good and bad way.Tarantino doesn't wield as much suspense in \"Django\" as in other films. The stakes were so much higher in \"Basterds,\" for example, perhaps due to the wartime, undercover nature of the plot and the involvement of Nazis. This made his lengthy scenes and fluffy dialogue keep you even more on edge, which happens in Django but not with the same sense of urgency. Instead there's a lot of racial tension, and while that adds an interesting side commentary, it doesn't have any bearing on how the events will ultimately unfold.\"Django\" is also much more predictable than Tarantino's pervious films, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. None of the turns of events will be shocking, especially if you've ever seen a Tarantino film before. A lack of surprises always lessens the impact of a film, but there's a certain comfort and pleasure in knowing what's around the corner, because the result is absolutely satisfying.The biggest wildcard of the bunch is Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie, the Mississippi plantation owner who Django and Schultz discover owns Broomhilda. Not appearing until late in the film, we don't get to spend much time getting to know his character, so when he flips a switch it comes with a significant impact on the tone and the flow of the film. Still, there's not enough depth there for Candie to be a true villain, just a colorful one. Samuel L. Jackson is terrific as his housekeeper, Stephen, as well, but his and Candie's character arcs are disappointingly short. While Django is always motivated by Broomhilda from the start, there's no antagonistic thread that runs from beginning to end to make the payoff more than just carnally satisfying.As a piece of entertainment, if you're a fan of genre films, straightforward revenge-based premises or Tarantino, \"Django Unchained\" is nothing to complain about. It's expertly filmed, cleverly written, gloriously violent, funny and wholly satisfying. As obvious as it is in its methods from time to time, it never loses its stylistic edge and never falters in the mechanics of good storytelling. Tarantino is capable of being more clever as a writer and more dynamic as a director, but he puts all his best skills to use in \"Django\" and it doesn't disappoint.~Steven CThanks for reading!

            "content": "The truly breathtaking aspect of Quentin Tarantino's film-making is his use of music even if comes from a different time than the diagesis on screen.I got chills watching 'Django' in the scene where Jim Croce's 'I Got A Name' played whilst the title character and his German bounty hunter compatriot Dr. Schultz (Christoph Walz) ride off against backdrop of a rugged western landscape.A truly frustrating aspect of Quentin Tarantino's film-making is his apparent resistance to cutting the footage he shoots. 'Django' is at least 30 minutes too long - a time elongated with pointless cameos of terrific actors recognizable to 1980s TV aficionados and fans of Grindhouse productions. There are enough character actors to fill three movies but too many for one.Tarantino gave himself a speaking role (Always a mistake) and inexplicably did the worst attempt at an Australian accent ever. There was no need for that and no need in fact for sizable chunks of the movie that he nevertheless chose to include.Some will take issue with the numerous glaring anachronisms. I don't mind those so much particularly given the tone in which the diagesis is presented which evokes European-made westerns of the 1960s. Scenes that go nowhere fast and utterly baffling pacing are things I take issue with however.A complete re-edit would serve to present the essence of the story more efficiently whilst emphasizing more appealing aspects. It would also serve more efficiently hide flaws. Some of Tarantino's best work is buried within some of his worst.Stylistically the reaction shots evoke Bogdanovich but in a good way. The violence evokes Peckinpah as do the blood spatters and moments of emotional havoc.",

            "content": "The penultimate film of our Tarantino retrospective (as I reviewed \"Once Upon a Time\" on its release last year) which, despite the difficult and sometimes brutal subject matter, I've come to think might actually be the second most enjoyable film in Tarantino's canon.A German born bounty hunter, Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) rescues and frees a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx) as he can help identify a series of targets for him. As they spend the winter together, their bond grows and Schultz learns that Django has a wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who was sold several months previously. Discovering that Broomhilda is under the ownership of Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) the pair head for his estate but decide that subterfuge is their most feasible plan for buying her freedom.It's hard not to start with the awkwardness I feel about Tarantino's repeated use of a certain racial epithet across his work. Usually (though not always) it's in the mouths of his \"bad\" characters, which I think might offer some small justification for it. Here virtually every character says it all the time, so much so that it starts to lose some power, which is a dangerous way to go.Plot wise - it's probably Tarantino's best film. It's told in a linear fashion but weaves together aspects of the 70's blacksploitation Django films, with a loose telling of a parable that it explicitly references in the film, that of German folklore story Siegfried and Brunhilda. It has the tension of the scenes from \"Basterds\", the violence of \"Kill Bill\" but is a better story than either of them. It also has better performances. Waltz shifts from villain in his last collaboration to perhaps the biggest hero of any Tarantino film, DiCaprio is always perfection, Samuel L Jackson is oddly comedic relief, given the nature of his character and Jamie Foxx is note perfect as the titular character.If the summary of this Tarantino retrospective is that some of the films aren't as good as I remember, \"Django Unchained\" and \"Deathproof\" are the two that buck that trend.",

            "content": "Displaying the same disturbed imagination of a twelve year old that has made him the darling of hipster film watchers Quentin Tarantino's Django is filled with all the predictable heavy handed juvenility one has come to expect from the \"vaunted\" writer director. It is his typical mix of gratuitous violence and sadism, hints of humor and a script sprinkled, no plastered with his two favorite spicy words. Marinated with heavy hand and pretension it is a slow go from the outset buoyed along by intervals of explosions and gun play to keep you awake for it's nearly three hour run.Bounty hunter/dentist King Schultz (Chris Waltz) buys ( in a very violent fashion naturally) slave Django (Jaime Foxx) from some surly traders and sets out to train him as an assistant in the bounty trade. It becomes a lucrative partnership for the pair but Django yearns for the return of his wife Brunhilde (a subtle Wagnerian touch by QT) and a strong desire to shoot surly unkempt Southerners. Arriving at the plantation of Calvin Candy (aptly called Candyland) in Mississippi he finds her and they try to create a ruse to win her release. House slave Stephen (Sam Jackson) however suspects something is up and it leads to the same blue print mayhem to be found in Tarantino's films, in this case a Kill Bill rehash with lead instead of swords.As Django, Foxx mopes and Eastwood's most of the way while the rest of the cast overacts ferociously, particularly in scenes between Candy and Stephen. The rest of the cast is relegated to being as unctuous as possible with pull cords reciting the same two words.For Tarantino fans it will probably not disappoint with its lusty bloodletting, tough talk and folks getting blown up. But with little to add to a canon of work fraught with heavy handed self indulgence it remains another one of his coloring book fantasies with dirty words and buckets of blood. The only difference is his cartoon characters have changed costumes and time traveled to other lands. Everything else is the same. It is another one of his big budget B movies.",

            "content": "Wow! You just can't beat watching a good Western, Action, Comedy, Thriller all wrapped up in to one great film for the history books. Then to top it all off why not have it directed by Quentin Tarantino and have your lead actor played by Jamie Foxx dressed to the nines in his nice blue velvet suit and frilly white scarf that reminds us of the renowned painting \"The Blue Boy\" by the English painter/artist Thomas Gainsborough. Django Unchained will certainly go down in the history books of cinema as a true classic work of cinema art.The film was only nominated for five Academy Awards and ended up winning only two for Best Writing,Original Screenplay (Quentin Tarantino) and for Best Supporting Actor (Christopher Waltz). Personally I felt this film should have received several more nominations and won at least a few more Oscars. It is \"that good a movie\" that I have added it to my library of Classic Films of all time.To those viewers who felt Tarantino went over the top, I say to you that Quentin is still relatively a young man and you have not seen anything yet. Tarantino plays a small role in this film and how he writes his own character out of the film is just pure genius and sure to be talked about for centuries by those avid film goers and masters of the creative arts.There is a very strong supporting cast with names such as Kerry Washington, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L Jackson (he was better in Django Unchained than he was in Pulp Fiction if that is possible), James Remar, Walton Goggins, Don Johnson, M. C. Gainey, Michael Parks, and Ato Essandoh to name just a few of this brilliant cast of characters. I felt that all the actors put their heart and soul in to this film and it certainly was reflected on the big screen.One of my favorite scenes (and I had many favorite scenes) occurs relatively early in the film when the slave Django (played by none other than Jamie Foxx) accompanies a bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (played by Christopher Waltz) in to a towns local saloon to sit down and have a pint of cold beer. The slave Django is well aware and truly frightened to be sitting in a white mans saloon but at the coaxing of his rescuer Dr. King Schultz who promises Django an explanation shortly Django accepts the cold and refreshing beer while his curiosity about Dr. Schultz is getting the better of Django. What happens next is so bizarre that I would be spoiling the film for new viewers, but I will say it was simply a brilliant piece of screen writing. If you are a fan of Director Sergio Leone's and actor Clint Eastwood's 1960 spaghetti westerns trilogy than we the fans must demand that Quentin Tarantino and Jamie Foxx agree to sign on for two more sequels to Django Unchained and complete their own classic western trilogy as epic as A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad and the Ugly were to the 1960's. With Django Unchained they have a great start for a box office trilogy bonanza!",

            "content": "I pretty much gave up on Tarantino after \"Death Proof\". He had been my favourite filmmaker in the '90s, but as far as I'm concerned, with that movie, he totally lost the plot. The signs were there: with \"Kill Bill, vol. 2\" I kept wondering what happened to his ability to write witty and original dialogue.The dialogue was what was so great about his first movies. Back in the early '90s, movies used dialogue to advance the story. That was pretty much it. Watch an early '90s blockbuster like \"Basic Instinct\" for an example. Every time the characters talk it is only to communicate information that the screenwriters want the audience to know to help the movie get to its final destination. Tarantino's characters don't just talk because the movie needs them to. They talk because they have personalities of their own; there were no \"Mr Expositions\" in \"Pulp Fiction\" or \"Reservoir Dogs\".In \"Death Proof\", however, Tarantino totally fell on his own sword. That was the one where characters talked. And talked. And talked. And talked. And died in a car crash. And were introduced. And talked. And talked.The first time I watched \"Django Unchained\", I didn't get very far. There was too much Christopher Waltz, and of course, too much uninteresting dialogue. But I decided to give it another go just now.What I can say about the movie is that it is nowhere near as bad as \"Death Proof\". The dialogue isn't endless and tedious to that extreme. It's also not that interesting, though. The movie often lost my attention; it was hard to care too much for the plot. It was enlivened by its set pieces and hand picked character stars.It did not need to be almost three hours. I think most of the dialogue between Waltz and Foxx could have been cut out, and the details discussed shown, rather than told.What the hell did Waltz win the Oscar for? If any performance in the movie was Oscar-worthy, it was DiCaprio's. Waltz was a plot device, and pretty one-note.",

            "content": "I know claiming \"Tarantino's Best\" is quite a statement with such films as \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Inglorious Bastards\", however I truly believe it is. Django Unchained is superb from start to finish, it's a 2 hour and 45 minute movie yet you're on the edge of your seat, eyes glued to the screen for the whole ride. It's the closest thing to a flawless movie I have ever seen. Before I continue my praise of this movie, let me say this \"the movie is not for everyone.\" Clearly its rated R and it has several gruesome violent scenes, it also contains vulgar language and numerous uses of the \"n\" word. Some may claim it's excessive, but I personally appreciate how realistic it portrays the horror and tragedy of slavery. That being said, I am torn if I am more impressed with Tarantino as a writer of this movie or its director. He simply is a cinematic genius. The casting of this movie alone deserves an Oscar. Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, and Leonardo DiCaprio all put on Oscar worthy performances, and frankly, I would be astonished if they all did not win. I truly can't picture any actor on this planet being able to play any of those three roles as magnificently as these three actors did. I sum this movie into three general thirds, First: where Waltz steals the show, Second: where DiCaprio steals the show, and Third: where Foxx steals the show. I have only seen Waltz in \"Inglorious Bastards\" other than \"Django Unchained\" and he is rapidly climbing my favorite actors list. Leo is my personal favorite actor ever since his performance in \"The Departed\" and it was incredible to see him take on the challenging role as his first villain, Calvin Candie, possibly the most evil character I've ever seen in a film. Finally Jamie Foxx from start to finish played his best performance in any movie to date. Simply phenomenal. I loved how the audience sees his character evolve from a powerless slave to a confident powerful man. In addition to these three remarkable performances, Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson also deliver. Washington goes through living hell yet remains a strong woman throughout. Jackson plays a very interesting role as Stephen, Leo's loyal house slave. Trust me, you will hate him yet at the same time he is hilarious. Now's a good time to mention, this movie is funny! Tarantino perfectly tosses in frequent bursts of pure laughter throughout the movie to lighten up from the serious aspects of the movie. There is one scene in particular, involving Jonah Hill and Don Johnson, which had the crowd roaring in laughter for a solid full minute. Which brings me to my next point, the cast is absurd! The rather small roles for such big actors such as Jonah Hill and Don Johnson, just shows how honored actors are taking any role no matter how small for a Quentin Tarantino film. I recognized famous actors and actresses throughout the entire movie. There is one brief scene, where I believe I even saw famous rapper \"Childish Gambino\" for literally just a few seconds as a slave in Mississippi. This movie was done perfectly to a tee; even the remarkable soundtrack caught my attention, nicely combining songs of the past with modern day songs. This movie is a western, a drama, a tragedy, a comedy, an action, a thriller, and at it's deepest roots a romance. If you haven't already, stop what you're doing and see this movie today. Whatever you're doing can wait but this movie can't. Just make sure your 17, have your license, and have a stomach for more of the most gruesome violence I have yet to see on a screen. In conclusion, I've heard rumors of Tarantino pondering the idea of retiring as a director and Oo what a sad day that would be for movie lovers like myself, but if they are true at least he's going out with one hell of a BANG!",

            "content": "DJANGO UNCHAINED is yet another film I was in absolutely no hurray to see . This was mainly down to the fact I thought INGLORIOUS BASTERDS was easily one of the worst films to ever have nominated as Best Picture at the Academy Awards . An overlong self indulgent mess that wouldn't have been made if the name Tarantino wasn't associated with it . Add to this much of the reviews stated that the best thing about it was Christoph Waltz similar to what critics thought was the best thing about IB and I was under the impression I'd be watching an identical movie this time where the war genre had been replaced by a Western one and I don't like Westerns so no reason to watch what I believed was going to be utter rubbish .I went in to DJANGO UNCHAINED with very low expectations which helped a lot but much of my enjoyment of this bloody black comedy was down to seeing 12 YEARS A SLAVE . Now that was a serious true life tale on a serious subject and was totally sombre and humourless but I found myself constantly comparing the two movies with not too dissimilar themes and an identical setting in time and place . Indeed if 12 YEARS A SLAVE was the prior piece then I'd jump to the conclusion Tarantino was not only inspired by McQueen's film but was actively spoofing it . Slavery is wrong of course and laughter is the best medicine so what better antidote than combining ludicrous dialogue and situations on a serious topic ? A deconstructionist film similar to BLAZING SADDLES ? Yeah why not ? The early part of the film is very episodic and doesn't really get to the main bulk of the story until about halfway through . If you don't like the opening scene then it'd be a good idea to simply switch off because there's more than two and a half hours to go . There's extreme violence which is a homage to the great Sam Peckinpah and unrestrained racist language but neither is meant to be taken seriously in my opinion and would have liked to have seen this in the cinema if only to gauge the audiences reaction . Anyone who doesn't laugh like a drain at the over the top deaths and racial slurs might just be in danger of being called a hypocrite . That said there is a murder involving a pack of dogs that isn't graphic but by the same yardstick feels very jarring in tone with the rest of the movie and there's no indication of any humour being meant unlike the rest of the film and one wonders what point the director is making by including it ? Everyone has already praised Waltz and just to make it official his peers gave him a well deserved Oscar as best supporting actor . Everyone has also praised DiCaprio who is very much cast against type . A lot of people have praised Foxx who seemed to disappear from the radar after his Oscar winning role in COLLATERAL but he's very good here . For me the stand out performance was Samuel L Jackson as housekeeper Stephen who despite being black probably uses the N word more often than anyone else and no one can pronounce the mofo phrase entertainingly well as Samuel L Jackson . It is one of the most memorable screen performances of recent cinema and it's a great pity Waltz stole all the acting acclaim and awards for this movie . Jackson deserved a Oscar nomination at the very least I didn't think I was going to enjoy this especially since it clocks in for two and three quarter hours but as the end titles came up I found myself still wanting even more . I'd consider this Tarantino's masterwork and even found myself forgiving him for INGLORIOUS BASTERDS . Please Quentin I want some more",

His films have so much personality and style, you don't even know what to do but sit back and enjoy the ride. There is a lot of cinematic power in his films, and Django Unchained is a force to be reckoned with for sure.Revenge is obviously the main theme here, a common one in Tarantino's films, and Django gets his in spades, taking out a number of slave-masters and otherwise villainous characters in the film. I think Tarantino is tapping into, and exploiting some deep-seated elements of the collective African-American unconscious in Django's quest for revenge, and he does it with this spectacular spectacle.Worth seeing for Tarantino fans and those wanting to explore cinematic representation of the Antebellum South.",

            "content": "Yet another Tarantino exploitation cartoon that foolish critics and Awards committees have tarnished their names and reputations by stumbling blindly into the filmmaker's simplistic style of moviemaking. This 'style' is all about copy-cat plagiarism, which proves, if you make enough money from fooling people who should know better, you can thumb your way to the top of a bottom-rung industry. If you've seen one Tarantino movie you've seen them all, it's only the names and settings that change (slightly).This movie-maker is as readable as a child: the first rule of thumb; Take themes that spark controversy, over- exacerbate the violence and gore in order to hook those with a cause or agenda to push, and they will follow blindly to the ticket box - making the likes of supporters, Harvey Weinstein and a handful of overly familiar stars (mates) along with a full assortment of soulless industry associates very rich. Violence and lurid subjects appeal to the lowest common denominator the world over (only need to check out the daily news for some confirmation) and, the monkey see monkey do syndrome will unfortunately, always be with us, this also gives us a punishing three hours of torture to prove it.Handfuls of insightful commentators have seen through the thinly-veiled ugliness, and bravely called it out. See; Thomas Frank - Louis Farrakhan - and surprisingly, industry personalities such as fellow moviemaker Spike Lee, and actor/reviewer Jesse Williams, who all clearly see the folly of Tarantino being taken in any way seriously. Then there's the silliness of Michael Moore attempting to call it 'satire'! The most obvious rip-off in this piece of tosh is the spaghetti western, after all, what did Italy know about the experience of living through the American west? Europeans were simply enamoured by the 'romance' of watching fictional American westerns. Leone is blatantly copied right down to the choice of music (with even the composer, Morricone, calling Tarantino out for his lack of original ideas) The bulk of other music is as with most of this copyists work, lifted from other better films and too often unsuited to the era or narrative themes.Much more could be said but why bother, when consumers seem to love being coned - right down to their History, groceries, comic books, and so on...",

It is disappointing that a film which could have been groundbreaking won't have as much significance because of it's juvenile overvalued violence aspect. There are an abundance of truthful potential stories that could convey the same \"look how far we have all come from being a barbaric country that once had slaves\" feeling movie makers seem to want to credit themselves with (I'm thinking of that laughably unbelievable fictional story \"The Help\" which was also made into a film). To be worthwhile a filmmaker attempting to create something of value to present and future generations should look to a well researched, fascinating book like The Hemingses of Monticello: An American family by Annette Gordon-Reed for example. There are better ways to entertain oneself than watch this movie which all too quickly turns into a series of unnecessary bloodbaths.",

The two Bounty hunters go from town to town & plantation to plantation in search of Criminals & Django's wife, this leads them to the evil plantation owner Calvin Candie, an excellent performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as such a nasty & evil villain of this piece. There's also Tarantino regular Samuel L Jackson as an evil black butler type who is just as racist as the Southern whites!!! There's lots of other great actors in small roles & there's lots of very funny moments & black humour throughout but there's also still the dark & raw look into the evil times of slavery & it gets extremely violent & bloody. I loved this mix of fact & fiction turned into a revenge fantasy just like Tarantino did with his \"Inglourious Basterds\" & his \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" that's why he's such a great story teller & film maker. I did notice alot of similarities to the excellent but underrated Will Smith western \"Wild Wild West\" from 1999, now i know the part of \"Django\" was written with Will Smith in mind but he turned it down, so there's lots of bits & bobs & scenes & it's look that Tarantino obviously borrowed from Smith's Wild Wild West!!!\nSmith would've been excellent as Django as he's a great actor but hey we got the excellent Jamie Foxx & he nailed the part as extremely tough & raw freed slave.\nWhen the killing gets going it's so exciting & gripping as these evil Slave traders so deserve to die brutally & Django delivers, my favourite line in the movie is \"I like the way you Die boy\" from Django before he blasts an evil redneck in the chest, it's beautiful.\nThe movie looks fantastic & never was it boring because it's so interesting watching these richly detailed characters & this dark & dangerous world they are in & i loved the idea of these two Bounty hunters on a quest of vengeance!!! Another great Tarantino movie & another instant Classic.",

He is his own contemporary. It might be noticed that many of the criticisms for this one are...\"it is just more of that Tarantino stuff...haven't you done this before\". Well, of course he has. He likes it. So do Audiences and Critics. So why not? He is still young and will most likely do more, extend himself, and try new ways. But why now when he is having so much success at entertaining himself as well as many others.Once again, there isn't anything remotely like Django Unchained, except maybe his own Inglorious Basterds (2009). It has its \"roots\" in the Spaghetti Western, somewhat in Blaxploitation, but mostly its a satire on the modern mindset, still in existence, of the inferiority of lesser Races with genetic deficiencies. Because that's the way God intended. The most telling of all the anti-White scenes is at the Candyland table and the \"Scientific\" explanation of why the Slaves don't unchain themselves and fight back against their oppressors (it's in their physiology).This is a feverish foray into that fight back Fantasyland for shackled people everywhere. A wish fulfillment of revenge without remorse and hatred for those who hated and abused. It is a sometimes funny and a slightly poetic display of modern Pulp Fiction with excessive violence. But for those commenting about the ultra-violent and bloody display, they might think about how ultra-violent and bloody it must have been to really be under the yoke of what is being riffed here.",

The pacing of this film is inconsistent and faulty. Glaring plot holes eliminate the suspended disbelief that is required to digest any pseudo-authenticity that this film may contain. Very little effort was made to check the veracity of the depictions in this film (see the Goofs section for this film). While some parts of the film are exciting, comical and shocking, these fleeting moments are carelessly strung together in a story that will unfortunately be blindly cherished by people who worship Tarantino's reputation and previous work. The intention to make a great film may have been absent from Tarantino's process because he probably takes it for granted that people will pay to see almost any film that his name is associated with.*****SPOILER ALERT: In the end, Tarantino has ripped all of us off (maybe purposefully because he holds such contempt for society). At the abrupt end of this film, Django and Broomhilda are riding away on horseback in the night, in the slave-owning South, away from a multiple homicide and from the burning wreckage of the mansion of a reputable and wealthy plantation owner. They will likely be killed or re-captured, either way the filmmaker has ended his film on a weak note by ignoring the real-life implications of slavery and racism in exchange for an exploitive and glorified re-telling of story that relates to many of the social inequalities that continue to plague our society.Boo-urns.

I hadn't seen it since then. This movie was on the Internet Movie Database poster that Jaime and I were working through, so we were both giving it a rewatch.I'm so glad that I came back to this. Knowing more about Westerns made me enjoy this movie more. I'm not versed in them as much as some of the people that I listen to through podcasts, but they're relayed some information that is quite interesting. One of them being that Django was a character that had a bunch of movies. There wasn't always a lot of continuity between each one, but it was a recognizable character. I like that this movie even had the first man to take on the role in a cameo, Franco Nero.For the movie itself, I love what Quentin Tarantino did here. We are getting a bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), who seeks out the aid of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx). Dr. Schultz doesn't agree with slavery, but there isn't a lot he can do. He does free Django and the two become partners. We see their relationship grow. This is coupled with people in the south who see them as property. I do think we've come a long way, but there are people who still don't respect them. It is heartbreaking. It also satisfying as they decide to take out bad people.The acting here is great. Seeing Waltz go against Leonardo DiCaprio is tense. They both are amazing. Foxx is also good along with Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson. There are a bunch of cameos here that are also good. Going along with that, we have cinematography. It feels like the era that it is set. The blood and violence are a bit over the top, but this is also part exploitation film which makes sense.

The plot gets more and more ridiculous, and clich\u00e9 reworked, no matter how dazzlingly, is still just clich\u00e9.

He put his whole heart in this movie(as he does in every movie of his) and he easily made me speechless at the end of it. This is an intense movie that not only keeps you engaged, but it also keeps you guessing. This film is genius in every aspect. Firstly, the acting is simply out of this world. Jamie Foxx was brilliant and natural at the same time in every single scene. Then, there is absolutely no one who could have portrayed, Calvin Candie better than Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a master. Christoph Waltz is such a magnificent actor who really does put his heart on the table for each film he does. The whole cast and crew did a great job in putting this movie together piece by piece. The score was in fact, one of the best parts of the film, as it kept you connected to the story at all times.\nI would like to say that in my opinion, this movie tops every other movie of Tarantino's magical filmography.

            "content": "There's been no film more divisive or more igniting in terms of strong Oscar speculation then Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained. After months of shooting, word of a last minute edit (some believe editing is still going on currently), the film has finally hit cinematic eyes and the \"final\" product is both bold and misguided. Django Unchained is big and full of Tarantino life and color that we've come to love about him. On sheer production value, it's his finest film endeavor to date. Set designs are simply gorgeous, Robert Richardson captures some beautiful shots, and Sharen Davis proves once again, she's one of the most awe- inspiring designers working today. Tarantino does go a bit \"out there\" in his choices of dialogue along with the developing and rising structure of the story. Where Tarantino succeeds is in digging some terrific performances out of his principal cast, even if his film is at times lunky, problematic, and a bit messy.In the opening title sequence, Tarantino uses one of the best film theme songs this century and setting up \"Django\" for an audacious roller coaster ride. The film tells the story of Django (Jamie Foxx) who with the help of his mentor Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) becomes a bounty hunter in the 1800s and sets out to save his slave wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of an evil plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).Anyone who knows my cinematic mind, knows my feelings about Jamie Foxx and his abilities as an actor. For the most part of his career, I've found him immensely overrated, though excels quite well in comedic driven vehicles. As the uneducated yet craftly-minded Django, Foxx does one of his finest works. As satisfactory as Foxx is and given the nature in which the character is written, he gives Django a needed sensitivity that lacks in this grotesquely violent portrait. This isn't to say Foxx doesn't fault. His interpretation of Django at the beginning of our tale, fresh off the slavery line and later becoming an A-list free bounty hunter is not entirely on point. Not always being believable, at least in drama, is Foxx's major flaw. Where he'll start by burying himself into a character, by the end of the three-hour finale, Foxx's natural and Foxx-mannerisms reveal themselves in an awkward fashion.When Christoph Waltz came into our lives as Hans Landa in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (2009), many cinematic-lovers thought their lives would never be the same. Waltz's ticks, evil grin, and astounding portrayal went on to win, very deserving, the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. As Dr. King Schultz, Waltz recaptures much of that magic and demonstrates once again, he is one of the most talented actors to grace our land in quite sometime. What Waltz demonstrates so brilliantly is how he can both inhabit the soul of a man with no remorse or fear to take life yet have this potent and clear sensitivity for humanity. A divine interpretation. Waltz is fearless, becoming a man with no obvious background, and building one of the finest portrayals by an actor this year. Simply superb.In a near-mute performance, Kerry Washington, and make no mistake, is absolutely magnetic and steals focus from every single actor in every single frame. As Broomhilda Von Shaft, Washington delivers a performance reminiscent of Holly Hunter's Ada McGrath in Jane Campion's The Piano (1993), a turn Oscar recognized and is equal in talent and execution. Besides the obvious beauty Washington naturally exhibits, her heartbreaking and bravura work stands at the top of anything she's delivered in her respectable career. Though the work is brief, and in many ways a background ornament that some might miss, without it, the film and the fable would feel simply meaningless. Washington is purely fantastic.As the flamboyant and wicked Calvin Candie, Leonardo DiCaprio steps out of his usual comfort zone and is as charismatic as I've ever seen him. When Calvin is on an even keel, telling a story, and simply on his lower register, DiCaprio excels. It's when the work hits the high notes, over-the-top anger or forced fuming yells, it can often feel stale in its execution. One thing I've noticed is that Tarantino attempts to give DiCaprio, and the character Candie, instances of an \"evil monologue,\" where the audience can find the brutality of his motivation spelled out on the screen for all to see. Tarantino attempted this in past films like Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004) with David Carradine in the scene with the Bride and B.B. and the infamous story about the fishbowl. In most Tarantino films, this tactic works. In the newest effort, it doesn't come off as a natural disposition and simply out of character. The only conclusion I can come up with his either Tarantino doesn't fully understand his characters and/or their motivations, although he did create them, or simply the editing and the timeline didn't give him enough time to fully develop Django Unchained into the story he envisioned. With all this said, DiCaprio is still memorable and should be worth the conversation of any awards body.As the grumpy and vulgar Stephen, Samuel L. Jackson delivers his best work in years, reminding audiences that when teamed up with Quentin Tarantino, Jackson can stand next to any other actor working in the business. One of Tarantino's successes in the screenplay is the creation of Stephen, a head of house slave for Candie. Jackson is the comedic backbone of the film and steals focus from many of its performers including DiCaprio and Waltz. Also making a brief but memorable turn is the talented Don Johnson as Big Daddy Bennett, a slave owner that moonlights as something even more offensive. Making a cameo, Jonah Hill makes his mark and makes it well...Read the rest at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",

The sharp editing allows the violence to be hard but appropriate and the storyline is strong. Leonardo plays it like Vincent Price channeling Snidley Whiplash, and quite camp. Terrific credit titles upfront, lots of 'spot the B grade actor' fun and a nice joke with Franco Nero.

            "content": "For those who don't want an in depth review, the easiest way to describe Django Unchained is to say it's Inglorious Basterds set in the Wild West. Just not quite as good. That's not to say it's bad movie. In the world of movies it is a good movie. However, this is Quentin Tarantino movie and in the world of Tarantino movies, this is not his best work. It feels very stock.From the very first few seconds of the opening of the movie it is immediately clear this is the Wild West Tarantino style - all kitsch, cool, badass, and darkly funny. However, Tarantino does exceptionally well at highlighting the real tragedy and brutality of American slavery. It's fair to say that although everyone knows slavery is and was bad, they don't really know how bad it was, how cruel it was, and what African-Americans had to go through just to have a chance at survival. Being made fully aware of this through this movie, in graphic visual detail, for me, jarred with the trying to add a cool element to it. On top of that the cartoonish violence, the buckets of blood, spouting like torrents when someone is shot, take away from the the impact of the redemption that Django is looking for. You really want the bad guys to die, but by killing them comically it takes away from the impact and righteousness of their death.Jamie Foxx does an OK job as Django, he doesn't drive the movie though. Although this is his story the movie is stolen by Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie. His portrayal is a triumph, at once both engaging, funny, yet deeply dark and violent. When he realises the ruse Django and Dr. Schultz (played by Christopher Waltz) are trying to con him in to selling them Djangos wife, his switch from southern gentlemen to violent, racist, murderer grips you. Christopher Waltz, on the other hand, although he gives a good performance, feels very much as if he is just repeating his performance as Hans Landa in Inglorious Basterds. Furthermore, a lot of the scenes seem to be similar to those in Inglorious Basterds, just with different characters. There are very few stand out scenes. In fact the best scene is a comical moment when the KKK, on their way to kill Django & Dr. Schultz, have an argument about how poorly their masks were made by one of the KKKs wives, and how they can't see where they were going. Although this movie promises much, it just doesn't deliver as much as it does in other Tarantino movies. It feels much more as if Tarantino was just taking it easy, doing the expected Tarantino things in the Tarantino way, not really pushing himself at all. It doesn't have the visual flair of Kill Bill vol. 1, it doesn't have the pace or freshness of Reservoir Dogs, it doesn't have the coolness or surprises of Pulp Fiction, or the great action scenes from Death Proof and Kill Bill. Tarantino is right, it's very doubtful it will win best picture at the Oscars. The surprise is it was even nominated at all to be honest. I think the subject matter may have been the reason why, it seems a very political nomination as this is far from Tarantino's best work.",

Waltz is the star here and has the BEST dialogue in the first half of the movie. He fades in the second half unfortunately. Same for all of T's movies since Pulp Fiction where EVERY character and EVERY piece of dialogue was golden. In his more recent movies we just get glimpses of it. But it is enough for me! Other than that it is over the top violent which is expected but the gore has been taken up a notch (to a silly slasher flick level). Not sure of the reason for that. It was borderline cartoon-ish and for some reason detracted from the movie. It really pulled me out.Last. And again typical of Tarantino needed to be about 30 minutes shorter. He needs a good editor. But at this point he can put in whatever he wants for his own amusement. See the whole interlude where he is a character. It almost seems as if he just couldn't bring himself to cut his own scene. It was really self-gratuitous and unnecessary to have Django Unchained twice with that as the interlude.",

            "content": "As with most Tarantino films, \"Django Unchained\" is not for all tastes. Tarantino is a filmmaker who makes films he'd like to see and his films are attuned to his own idiosyncratic tastes, which range from arthouse, to world cinema, to exploitation (both foreign and domestic), to even mainstream Hollywood. With \"Django Unchained\" Tarantino takes a wide set of influences and mashes them into one of the best revenge films of all-time (Kill Bill 1 and 2 were pretty great revenge flicks as well). The story is fairly straightforward. Jamie Foxx plays a freed slave who with the help of bounty hunter Christoph Waltz looks to free his wife, Broomhilda Von Shaft (a possible ancestor to John Shaft?), from Leonardo DiCaprio's villainous slave trading Calvin Candie (possibly Tarantino's most despicable villain since Gary Oldman's Drexell Spivey). The story is deceptively simple, but Tarantino's script is anything but. Drawing from samurai flicks, spaghetti westerns, blaxploitation flicks of the 70s, Hong Kong action films of the 80s (and that doesn't even scratch the surface), \"Danjgo Unchained\" can rightfully be called the ultimate revenge film, which builds to a bonkers climax that is as bloody as it is cathartic. Think John Woo's \"A Better Tomorrow II\" but even crazier, and that's saying something if you've ever seen's Woo's film. From the title and soundtrack, you'd think this would be Tarantino's take on spaghetti westerns, but it's better described as an ultraviolent souther gothic along the lines of \"The Beguiled\" more than it is like \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.\" Think \"Truck Turner\" as a weird west version of the southern gothic. Samuel L. Jackson in an interview described it as \"Shaft on a horse.\" And the film is just absolutely brutal at times. That \"Mandingo Fighting\" has to be one of the bloodiest fist fight scenes ever committed to film (reportedly there was an even more violent of version, but Tarantino rightly cut it, out of fears it would negatively impact the tone of the film). With his usual flair for eclectic casting, the film features a terrific cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson (\"Pulp Fiction\"), Walton Goggins (\"The Hateful Eight\"), Dennis Christopher (\"Face to Black\"), James Remar (\"The Warriors\"), Kerry Washington (\"Little Fires Everywhere\"), Don Johnson (\"Miami Vice\"), Franco Nero (the original Django), Tom Wopat (\"Dukes of Hazzard), Don Stroud (\"Coogan's Bluff\"), Russ Tamblyn (\"High School Confidential\"), Bruce Dern (\"The Driver\"), M.C. Gainey (80s character actor), Jonah Hill (\"Superbad\"), Lee Horsley (\"Matt Huston\"), Robert Carradine (\"The Big Red One\"), Tom Savini (\"Dawn of the Dead\"), John Jarratt (\"Wolf Creek\"), and Zoe Bell (\"Grindhouse\"), there's really no excuse for Tarantino fans to miss this excellent western revenge flick! FUN FACT! During the filming of one of the dinner scenes, Leonardo DiCaprio had to stop the scene because he was having \"a difficult time\" using so many racial slurs. Samuel L. Jackson then pulled him aside telling him, \"Motherf----r, this is just another Tuesday for us.\"PS: Stay tuned for a Django/Zorro sequel!",

            "content": "\"The D is silent!\" a quote that made so many people laugh and applaud. It's Robbie K again, this time reviewing Quentin Tarantino's latest film Django Unchained. The plot for this film is about a slave named Django(Jamie Foxx) who is rescued by a German bounty hunter named Dr. Schultz(Christoph Waltz). Apparently Django is one of the few men in Texas who knows the identity of a band of outlaws named the Brittle brothers. As payment for helping him, Schultz promises to track down Django's wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington) who is currently owned by a chauvinistic plantation owner named Calvin Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio). If you've seen Tarantino's work, you know that the man is very extreme in his movies and makes no attempts to censor his work. Django Unchained follows the same path, which for some will be enjoyable for some and rather grotesque for other. From the very beginning, Django starts off with blood as gun shots paint a messy shower of red. Yet the madness has only begun, as Shultz takes Django under his wing and helps him develop the killers edge needed to be a bounty hunter. As Django evolves, so too do the kills as the dynamic duo updates not only their arsenal, but techniques as well. The end result of this training are numerous scenes of gun blazing goodness, usually resulting in some sweet kills and bloody bodies. Are you sickened by the description? If so, then skip this movie as the cinematography captures enough detail to make some stomachs turn. Head shots, knees exploding, and a shots in the neck are common scenes in this movie. Some of these kills are not quick though, and the poor victims who suffer usually have some ugly wounds associated with them, some of which involve a person being torn apart or tortured. For me extreme gore isn't my cup of tea, as violence doesn't always have to mean a river of blood to follow. Despite the messiness though, Tarantino does still provide some other entertaining qualities that somewhat made up for the weaknesses. His choice of actors was well selected as both Foxx and Waltz work well together as the bounty hunter duo, each balancing out the other's character weaknesses. Waltz in particular uses his charm to not only swoon the various extras, but also as a tool to make his lines even funnier as he adds a pompous atmosphere to the conversation. Foxx on the other hand sticks more to the rough necked outlaw motif, saying little to his victims before firing the shot, though the little he says is more than enough to get a few chuckles out of the cast. Washington is just as lovely as ever, but doesn't get to do much other than scream and cry. While she can play a damsel in distress very well, this character was a little lacking compared to some of her other work. As for Jackson, his character is both fun and malicious. Jackson's overacted rants and cascade of stereotypical insults were hilarious to me for the most part, yet his character too sometimes overstepped the appropriate boundaries. As for DiCaprio, well the man is still on top of his game. Stepping out of the somber detective role, Leo's portrayal of the pompous plantation owner is incredibly captured in every detail from the rich debonair look to the heavy southern accent. The strongest aspect to his character is the viciousness he has to develop throughout the course of the movie, which starts with simple enjoyment at a blood sport, but turns into an anger that can't be controlled. Yet like many movies, Django does have its faults. For one thing the editing and filming require a little more polish to meet the qualities of his other films. Various settings don't match up with the areas they are supposed to be in, for example a rocky outcropping in the state of Tennessee, or a dried up wasteland for Mississippi. The grainy nature of the film is also a little harder to enjoy, though it may have been used to help develop and depth to the Western world. Pushing past the editing, the time limit of the movie was a little hard to deal with at times. While the pace of the movie was rather quick for the most part, there were a few times where I felt the scenes were pointless or overdone. The end of the movie in particular could have been modified to deliver the same entertainment in a fraction of the time. What may have contributed to some of these \"slower\" parts was the episodic element this tale seemed to have. Instead of having a nice linear plot with twists and turns, Tarantino sort of divided the story into 3-4 tales some of which lasted for minutes before the plot was just dropped. Perhaps it was just a means for introducing more satire and laughs, or just another excuse to add more gore, but some of these short stories could have been replaced with something to make the story deeper. Yet my biggest weakness was the uber amount of crudeness, Tarantino put in this film. I know that he designs this movie without a care to criticism, but his rebellious nature was a little out of hand this time. In particular the bloody savageness and filthy language were excessively overused to the point where it was no longer enjoyable, but annoying, despite the cultural relevance to the time period being portrayed.Django was a fun movie to watch, but it still has some flaws that need to be tweaked. Perhaps when the movie comes out on DVD the editing can hammer some things out. While it is not his best work, it's still enjoyable and will please any fan of his work. Just make sure to exercise caution when planning to take younger audience members to see it, as the crudeness factor has stepped up a bit.",

This film is a blood-soaked revenge story that packs SO much oomph in its character arcs, its great music and punchy dialogue. It takes slavery and uses that idea as an out-and-out crucifixion of the idea throughout Django Unchained's 2-hour and 45-minute runtime.This film was an experience to remember at the movies when it came out, and rewatching it is still a powerful if somewhat harrowing experience because of the slavery aspect. Django doesn't pull its punches with the story's brave exploration of the pre-Civil War American South and its very well thought-out direction and closure of the character's arcs are done in ways that some of the best self-contained screenplays of the past managed to pull-off so seamlessly: i.e. Casablanca, Star Wars(1977), Back to the Future, Pulp Fiction (of course), Toy Story and Her (2013). Django's a fantastic film that's not only a pleasure to watch over and over because of its revenge but also a crucial piece of film history thanks to confronting slavery within the context of a good-old-fashioned Western.For such a heavy movie it's a masterpiece of its craft and what it's standing for: taking on American history and giving the audience unmitigated truth and vengeance in its confrontation of slavery.Django gets 5/5 stars.",

How long can this juvenile director keep spinning the same old blood-spattered revenge theme in a genre remake? This is not cutting edge cinema, folks.

But, what really drives Django is finding Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) his wife, who is rumored to be at the Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) plantation. The year is 1858. Slavery is rampant and so is the \"N\" word. Yes, it's very uncomfortable hearing that word constantly. Do we get used to it? No. Do not expect any political correctness in here. Somehow we get used to crude language, which is also rampant, but never the \"N\" word. The acting all around is impressive, but it is Leonardo DiCaprio who steals the show even though it takes a while to get to him in here. You remember the title and wait for Django to unleash/unchain himself on evil-doers. Well, you just have to wait a little longer. He'll have his moments, but he needs to cool it while negotiations are going on to free Hilde (Broomhilda). As he has in the past Jamie Foxx proves, once again, that he is a class act. As brutal and serious as this story is there is also a lot of comedy. Witness the KKK riders who complain they cannot see through the eye-holes in the bags covering their heads. There are many other things that create some chuckles as well. There are many, many stars in here, but there is some difficulty recognizing them because many have gained weight, and beards hide their faces. However see if you can pick some out: Don Johnson, Walton Goggins, Tom Wopat, Don Stroud, Russ Tamblyn, Amber Tamblyn (but no beard here), Bruce Dern, Jonah Hill (he was one of the KKK riders), Lee Horsley, Michael Parks, and, keep an eye out for Quentin Tarantino (he should be easy to pick out).As we go along, you would think this is Christoph Waltz's story as his is a very big part. Sameul L. Jackson has a good role as the Head Household slave to DiCaprio's Candie and yes, he found a way to pontificate in here as he has in all his other movies; but he is good at it. Every now and then we get teased with a big western and then nothing after that. Boo Hoo. Let's hope that Quentin Tarantino can bring westerns back, but without the \"N\" word. I think we have had enough of it in here. Django was nominated for Best Picture. Christoph Waltz was awarded the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

Christoph Waltz. Easily one of my favourite charming European actors. DiCaprio is amazingly believable as the narcissistic and blatantly racist Candy.

Much of the later part of the film takes place on a Tennessee plantation owned by a charming but very devious man (Leonardo Dicaprio). The film is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.Tarantino is truly an enigma. As he proved in 'Pulp Fiction' and more recently in 'Inglorious Basterds', he is truly one of the best film-makers of the past twenty years. Likewise, in those other films plus the 'Kill Bill' series, violence is used in excess to advance the plot. The same is true in 'Django Unchained'. Some of the violence is necessary (considering the evil of slavery) and always well executed. It is rarely, if ever, the in-your-face gore which is used by less talented directors. Still, Tarantino's skill in creating edge-of-your-seat tension and suspense is so strong, he doesn't always need violence.But with all the qualms aside, this is truly one of the best films of 2012. Despite its length of nearly three hours, every moment is intense and engaging. This is mainly due to the film-maker's brilliant use of camera angles, music and getting the best from a great cast particularly from Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson plays the complex role of a high-ranking slave who gains much privilege in exchange for his willingness to turn (often harshly) against his fellow slaves. His performance was sadly overlooked during this awards season. (Jackson also gave Tarantino a superb performance in 'Pulp Fiction'.)I often turn away from violent films. But in that genre, nobody does it better than Quentin Tarantino. He has another winner here with 'Django Unchained'. - dbamateurcritic",

I must conclude it's the Tarantino juvenile fans who've mostly voted here, who consider a film is great if it has, as someone else wrote, witty dialogue (\"Permit me to parley with you\"), excessive profanity ('nigger'), excessive violence (including testicles getting blown off), and soulful (more like retro) musical score. What about an interesting story? Am I supposed to enjoy 3 hours of killing bad guys a la Inglorious Basterds because it is supposedly politically correct?

But the recent unpleasantness in Sandy Hook has gone almost unmentioned in the critical hosannas greeting Django\u0085because, you see, the invulnerable hero is a black gunman shooting bad (i.e., Southern white) people.It's not much more complicated than that.For example, in the The New York Times, the scholarly and mild-mannered A. O. Scott declares Django:\"a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism.\"According to Tarantino lore, the former video-store clerk is a dyslexic with a 160 IQ. It's hard not to be amused by how easily this semi-literate junior high school-dropout dupes 21st-century intellectuals.The reason Tarantino has had the time to watch so many bad movies is because he doesn't like the written word. Most people of Tarantino's intelligence discover that reading is a higher bandwidth way of finding out about the world than watching straight-to-video dreck. But the auteur's learning disability has left him defensively proud that he's ill informed about everything other than movies.Slavery is a potentially fascinating topic, but to have something interesting to say about it would require Tarantino to read a book. And that was never going to happen. After all, white men were the only men to abolish slavery but who cares about that little tidbit of truth?Tarantino may not know how to spell, but he knows how you are supposed to think: solely in terms of Who? Whom? The only thing that matters anymore is whose side you are on.Just as Tarantino is being praised today for empowering blacks by having them slaughter whites, he was praised for empowering Jews by having them slaughter Nazis in Inglourious Basterds and empowering women by having them slaughter men in Kill Bill.As you may have noticed, Tarantino isn't black, Jewish, or female. Nor has he shown much genuine interest in those designated victim groups. Instead, Tarantino's favorites have always been middle-aged movie tough guys.A cynic might suggest that what Tarantino really likes is the slaughtering. He's happy to make the details of who slaughters whom conform to the current prejudices, just as long as he gets to keep up the gore level. All Tarantino has had to do to critic-proof himself is identify the zeitgeist's sacred cows (so far, women, Jews, and blacks, but not gays) and have them massacre their foes. (Someday we may be treated to a Tarantino ABC Afterschool Special about the plague of bullying in which a CGI version of Charles Bronson show up at school to take out the homophobic trash.) The premise of Tarantino's latest film is that \"young Django,\" a slave played by 45-year-old Jamie Foxx, teams up with the loquacious Christoph Waltz, 56 (once again dripping with Gem\u00fctlichkeit before he suddenly guns everybody down) to kick white butt. In 2009's Inglourious Basterds, Waltz played a Nazi bad guy, while in Django he's a Viennese anti-slavery good guy, but he's always the same character, Tarantino's talkative alter ego.Indeed, Basterds' Jewish revenge plot was essentially a front to allow Tarantino to indulge his fascination with National Socialist (Nazi) cinema. What would it have been like, Quentin wondered, if he had been Goebbels to Harvey Weinstein's Hitler? In Django, a similarly vast amount of the dialogue is turned over to Waltz. Unfortunately, Tarantino's Teutonophilia can't get much traction in Django. He has a vague notion that in 1858 Richard Wagner was contemplating The Ring cycle\u2014thus Django's wife is named Broomhilda\u2014but has no idea what Waltz ought to do with that. (The excessively articulate Waltz would be better suited to playing Wagner,but the composer never killed anybody and lived before the invention of movies, so don't look to Quentin for biopic ideas.) All these distractions leave poor Foxx with little to do except shoot white people.In 2013, is the black gun violence Tarantino espouses really such a fascinating new phenomenon? For generations now, American media have been encouraging blacks to take violent retribution. We're coming up on close to a half-century of whites in the media egging on black badassery.How's Tarantino's macho minstrel show working out for black males, anyway? According to a 1967 government report sponsored by the Surgeon General, the black homicide rate began to rise in 1962 after a long decline. Mostly, though, whites just move out of the way and blacks kill each other. The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that for the 30 years from 1976-2005, there were 276,000 African-American homicide victims, 94% of them murdered by other blacks. They also hold the title in interracial rape with an average of 37,000 black on white assaults per year while the white on black is listed as \"less than 10,\" which we all know means zero.But who cares about a quarter of a million murdered black people and interracial rape? What matters is white-on-white moral status striving. And in that eternal war, even Quentin Tarantino is a welcome recruit. Enjoy.",

Basically the story is about someone being wronged and then that person takes violent revenge on everyone to blame for the rest of the film. Over and over Tarantino is spewing the same old story with gratuitously violent scenes. Kill Bill, Inglorious Bastards, and now Django are all the same story. I think Django is getting a lot of buzz because it deals with slavery. I found Django to be sleepy and boring. The cameo Tarantino treats audiences to is useless and unnecessary. The gratuitous violence is acceptable because the people killed are big, bad, white slave owners (yawn).Django is not a great film. Really, it isn't. Don't be such a follower and pretend you enjoy it like the rest of the herd. Go see Pulp Fiction or True Romance if you want to see a great Tarantino flick.",

First time was around 7 years ago or so and I feel like I have matured and gained a better knowledge and understanding of film (I did gain a film degree in this time). So I am rewatching high rated films. And I can safely say this one is amazing!!!The acting is just perfect, Christoph Waltz in particular is just outstanding in every way. In terms of acting performances this film is one of the best I've seen, because everyone is so good.The story is also great. It's interesting and really keeps you sitting there wanting more. I think what is so good about the story is that there isn't any dull moments, every scene has a purpose. A lot of long films feel like they are long for the sake of it and include scenes that are pointless. I didn't get that for Django at all.Obviously this film is also very dialogue heavy (you'd expect that with a Tarantino movie), but it flowed really well and had great action scenes throughout, as mentioned above also it wasn't as dull. A problem I had with Hateful Eight for example was that it focused too much on the dialogue and it did (in my opinion) become bland in places.I'll end it there because I don't want to bang on. But please watch this if you haven't already. I will say, just to end on, that the shock value is ramped right up with this one. Not only do you have a lot of gore (as per), but the use of the n word is almost excessive. Don't say I didn't warn you.But yeah, please watch it's great and you won't be disappointed. There's a reason it's so highly rated on here!!",

Apparently the premise is White people are awful and horrible and deserve to be shot (multiple times, with as much gory detail as possible) - all except the token good White guy who of course dies for his black friends in the end. Basically the entire movie is just this one black guy going on a rampage and killing dozens and dozens of \"evil\" Whites, and not much else. Booooring. ALso, the \"N\" word is tossed around like confetti throughout this overlong, underedited exhibition. It's almost as though Tarantino is trying to shock us, with the amount of violence, the amount of racism, the amount of needless gore. In the end I was just rolling my eyes and trying not to let my thoughts wander. If you are extremely self-hating, and enjoy watching a Black guy revel in killing Whites (including a woman), then you might just like this film (obviously a high number of people given the good score).

Together they set off on a mission to release a certain slave owned by ruthless plantation owner, Calvin Candie, that slave being Djangos wife.In all honesty I had some reservations about this movie as it didn't look to be anything too great, but I thought I'd give it a go and I was not disappointed. Out of the Tarantino movies I've seen not many have disappointed...Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs just to name some, are all superb and while Django Unchained is not on the same level as those for me, its not too far off.Now, if you're expecting the usual Tarantino style of action, blood and violence then you'll be sorely disappointed. I mean there is good amount of action in it (especially the last 30 minutes) but its just not the main story character. There's a few good comedy moments as well, with one favourite of mine being when a lynch mob are talking about whether to wear their hoods or not. I know - that doesn't sound funny but when you watch the movie you'll understand what I mean.There's a number of very obvious spaghetti western style moments too, such as the ultra-fast camera zoom, but all this adds to the style of Django Unchained.As for the characters, the relationship between Django (Foxx) and Dr. King Schultz (Waltz) is 1st class. They play off each other so well and they make what is already a good movie that bit better. DiCaprio was fantastic bringing a cold, calculating side to the already vicious streak of Calvin Candie. Jackson was excellent (as usual) as Stephen, Candies slave house master, and in one way is more ruthless than Candie because of the way even he treats the slaves.On the whole, whether you're a die-hard Tarantino fan, a period action/drama fan, or a fan of both, Django Unchained is definitely worth a watch and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

            "review_title": "Django unchained",
            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's 8th film \"Django Unchained\" is one hell of a movie. A brutal, bloody, terrifying, hilarious and awe-inspiring western disguised as a buddy movie that is so great that if John Wayne and Sergio Leone were alive now, they would've approve of this movie. It's designed to shock you, polarize you, test you and maybe even surprise you. But let me clear on this: If you are not a fan of bloody violence and the running length of 165 minutes, see a shorter movie. But if you love to see what Tarantino can do with movies like this, then you're in for a treat. Set during slavery in 1858, the movie follows Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (The always reliable Christoph Waltz) who hires him as a bounty hunter and a free man to find the Brittle Brothers. After finding them and hunting them down at a plantation run by Big Daddy (a remarkable Don Johnson), they relax for the winter only for them to go on a mission to find and rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who runs a plantation known as Candieland. He even has a renegade slave as a servant named Stephen (A nearly recognizable Samuel L. Jackson, hidden in makeup and some prosthetics), who will have a part to play in the last half of the movie. I think Quentin Tarantino has outdone himself once again. Being in the filmmaking game for 20 years now, you can't deny and even reject his style in what he is bringing to the screen (He also has a cameo in here as well). His dialogue is like reading a book that grabs you and makes you want to know what happens next. The look and scope of the film is magnificent, thanks to a brilliant Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson and the late production designer J. Michael Riva. The performances in this film are brilliant. Having won an Oscar for \"Ray\", Jamie Foxx continues with his breathtaking performances that wows us. Here as Django, he is certainly fearless, baring his soul (and body) playing a man who is free from slavery, but can't be free by the rules and limitations of slavery. Christoph Waltz looks like he was born to be a part of Tarantino's entourage after his Oscar-winning performance for \"Inglorious Basterds\". Here, once again he brings humor and vulnerability to Dr. King Schultz. Never before have I ever seen an actor go that far and doesn't go over-the-top like Leonardo DiCaprio. As Calvin Candie, DiCaprio is certainly Oscar-worthy as a man who runs a tight ship by running a place where male slaves fight to the death and female slaves are being prostitutes and he seems to be the kind of guy to like even though he is a villain and he speaks Tarantino's dialogue like a pro. When he has a scene in which he reveals three dimples from a skull that belongs to his father, he is literally terrifying. Kerry Washington is superb as Broomhilda and Samuel L. Jackson is the real scene-stealer. The supporting cast is great from Walton Goggins, Jonah Hill, Michael Bacall, Michael Parks, James Remar, Robert Carradine to a small cameo by Franco Nero. \"Django Unchained\" has a lot of things to say about slavery and how cruel it is. But at the same time, it provides the fact that if Tarantino rearranged history by shooting Adolf Hitler to a pulp while everything blows up at a movie theater, he can do it again by having a former slave whipping a man who used to beat him and his wife. Now, that's entertainment. This movie really is off the chain. It's not only one of the most captivating films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year. Go see it, it will be worth your time. Keep in mind though, there are characters, especially Django, Stephen, Candie and Schultz that uses the N-word numerous times in this movie. That seems relevant to the time period, don't ya think?",

This is not a bad film, but I'm not saying it's a good one.The length of the film is one of the main flaws. There are many scenes that do not serve a purpose to its characters and story. Which leads to its pacing problem. These irrelevant scenes exist in the film that often slows it down. It is very unbalanced.Mostly, it's the characters and performances. Many are giving praise to Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio. Waltz, first of all, is in similar territory when he was in Inglorious Basterds. He and his character served their purpose and Waltz was just fine in the role, but nothing to highly praise. DiCaprio as Calvin Candie was nothing worth noting. Either its in the performance or the script, I never really invested in him. It's as if Tarantino wanted to write a great movie villain and that's what DiCaprio took as his only direction. There is a scene where he gets the evil monologue, but it comes very forced with ultimately ends up destroying the character. Jamie Foxx, first of all, was the right choice for Django, but I believe that Tarantino did not trust his protagonist. It takes a long while to get invested in him, but at that point, why bother? BUT, the standout for me was Samuel L. Jackson. He takes his character Stephen is able to go beyond the material that is given. There is fun in his performance which is what the film should be.I am well aware that I will be in the minority, when it comes to disliking the film. How people will try to tell me that there was more to the story than meets the eye, how it's a great revenge tale, how the characters were great and well written etc. But this is not a good Quentin Tarantino film. The film is too long, with characters that hold the most minimal of interests. I will be really dishearten to see this film receive awards and praise. Maybe it's the love of Quentin that will jade people. I know it will. But after coming out of a strong year for film, Django falls flat.The movie lacks the confidence of character(s) and story in a hyper active world. It loses it's identity somewhere along the line and the little scenes of greatness cannot save it. Most of all it does not have the joy of film that often add life to Tarantino films.",

Apparently in a Tarantino film you're not supposed to question incongruities and historical absurdities; it seems, for some inexplicable reason, such restrictions apply only to other filmmakers. So rap songs in a pre-civil war western are okay as long as your name starts with T and ends with O. Negroes riding around with cool sunglasses talking back (or is that 'black'?) to plantation owning southerners without instantly getting blown out of the saddle is all part of Tarantino-World; as indeed are weapons with an accuracy far beyond anything known in the 19th Century. So no, I'm not going to question the lack of verisimilitude in this movie; I couldn't be so unkind to such a genius movie maker. I'm just going to question the logic of one particular scene.The \"Doc' has this Derringer, right? Which springs out of his right sleeve. We've seen already that it fires two shots (and is surprisingly deadly for such a small calibre weapon). He wants to kill DiCaprio. However, DiCaprio's henchman has a gun on his friends. So he shoots DiCaprio, says \"I couldn't resist\" or some such, and stands there as if waiting to be shot? Why? I mean if his gun had two bullets, he could have shot the henchman first (in the head, as he was directly to the right of him) and then shot DiCaprio, who was weaponless. It made no sense (pretty much like the rest of the movie really). He was supposed to be a master strategist, but a 3 year-old-child could have seen what needed to be done there. It wouldn't even have effected the plot much. You could have still had that repellent splatterfest afterwards and just had the Doc die in that. Really, folks, that's just bad, bad writing.I won't list any more silliness. Not even Tarantino himself affecting a weird Australian accent (what was that all about? Is there evidence that Australians used to escort black prisoners to the mines in the 1850s?). No, to me this was clearly just another Tarantino revenge fantasy project made for no other reason (money excluded, of course) than to convince the rest of us that humanity really is as unremittingly black-hearted as Tarantino sees us.

Because the interview, despite that segment, isn't altogether bad (on Quentin's end, anyway) and the film itself is incredible.Django Unchained portrays (in the best way someone forced to work under the MPAA censors are permitted) slavery in an eye-opening way that manages to be heartbreaking while still maintaining the interest of the viewer. It was successful in creating an open dialogue about slavery and racism that we didn't have prior to this film, and it's something I'll always be grateful to Quentin for doing.\nDjango is a sobering movie with an important message, respectfully handing the subject matter when necessary but also giving the audience the cathartic violence they come to expect from a Tarantino picture. It's an epic 165-minute piece that doesn't feel at all like it runs for 2 hours and 45 minutes. It was incredible, without a dull moment or a minute of filler. Fantastic piece of fiction!",

            "content": "Like director Quentin Tarantino's earlier movie, \"Inglourious basterds\", this one is about the return of the repressed. In the earlier movie, that was the Jew, with the added twist that this time he was taking the fight up to Hitler! This time, it's the negro slave just before the American civil war which outlawed slavery. Not sure if Tarantino has mined all the wronged ethnic groups...Jews and black Africans...that's it, surely? Stay tuned. In any case, like \"Inglourious basterds\" this is a highly entertaining day dream of the \"What if...?\" variety. A revenge fantasy in other words.The story involves a secret bounty hunter (Dr. King Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz) who poses as a travelling dentist, in order to find his latest targets, three brothers wanted for murder and robbery. He needs somebody who can identify the brothers for him, so needs a slave to buy who knows them by site. That turns out to be Django (played by Jamie Foxx). Schultz is a German and has an 'innocent abroad' way to him, as far as America's slave system goes. He marvels at people's reactions to what Django does when he is with him. It is curious to me why Tarantino chose a German to be in this role. Having recently watched the interesting documentary series \"Civilisation: Is the West history?\", I know that Adolf Hitler's views on race were shaped by a German 'scientist' in colonial Africa...in the late 19th century. This link came to me in a scene involving a skull in this movie...there is a very horrific story in the documentary series concerning this German 'scientist' and an African woman, also concerning the creation of a skull.Anyway, despite Schultz being no advocate of slavery, he realises he needs this cover for his bounty hunting activities (his main cover is that of being a dentist)...Django will play the role of his servant. For this reason, Schultz helps turn Django into an effective bounty hunter...a skill that will become useful to him as Django seeks to reunite with his wife, Broomhilda von Schaft (! played by Kerry Washington), who is a slave on a notorious plantation.In Hollywood movies or TV series of decades ago, you would often see African Americans in roles...as slaves or as house servants in modern set stories. For the latter, particularly, it's not clear to me exactly what the meaning of this is...that African Americans have 'improved' their lot in America? That they are now treated better by white Americans? There is no such mystery in \"Django unchained\". Django is the unconventional hero with a quest...where he gets to kill white people. Unthinkable decades ago in US pop culture...that would ordinarily make the character a villain.Things I liked in this movie: * A collage of visual styles, taking their cues from genre movies or movies from other countries.* The visual aesthetic of place...e.g. the boggy Main St. in some tiny town...it really made the place look like a dung hill...which is unusual for Westerns.* Leonardo DiCaprio's gaze of searching intensity on Django (DiCaprio plays Calvin Candie, a notorious slave owner who Django must deal with in order to get his wife returned to him safely).* An interesting question asked by Candie to his dinner guests, where he uses a human skull as a prop. Be interesting to know if the answer he proffers was the 'intellectual' explanation of the day. It's this scene which brought to mind the scene in the documentary series \"Civilisation\" and the question of why Tarantino had a German play the role of the bounty hunter. Irony? * I especially liked the scene where Big Daddy (who I didn't realise was played by Don Johnson...hey, I never watched \"Miami vice\"!) discusses with one of his female slaves how she should treat Django...it's witty and shows real human character and psychology at play. Good screen writing that.* There is also humour in Django's early fashion sense, once he becomes part of Schultz' quest to claim the bounty on three brothers.* Speaking of actors I did not recognise...I had heard that Samuel L. (for \"Ladies love...\"?) Jackson was good in a disturbing role in this movie. I was enjoying the humour of a certain character in this movie and then...it dawned on me that that was Mr. Jackson hisself! Most amusing was his character's paraphrasing of William Shakespeare's Richard III (who, by the by, has recently been discovered under car park in England!). Other points of interest: * I was browsing a newsagent magazine rack and noticed a feature on this movie...there was a particularly horrific picture from the movie...it might have been on the cover of this magazine, which was a horror magazine. Glad to say that this scene is not in the movie...even though the movie is bloody and violent, this particular shot (which I assume to be in the slave fight scene in Candie's mansion) was just too gruesome, in an over the top manner. Which begs the question: has the Australian release of this movie been censored? If not, is that scene to be included in some 'director's cut' of the film for DVD? * Quentin Tarantino plays an Australian in this movie...for some reason. Australian John Jarratt also is in scenes with him, playing an Australian. This just seems really random. Jarratt piles his 'Australianness' on thick and Tarantino's accent is good in parts. Well, good in part, singular. Still, Robin Williams could no doubt learn something about Australian accents from Tarantino. Which isn't really saying much! All this stuff is anachronistic, but fits in with some of the caricatures of Americana found in this movie.* Story wise, I did find it odd how Schultz' and Candie's final interaction with each other played out, considering what was at stake...beforehand, it was Schultz always advocating Django to be judicious.",

            "content": "It's not that there is no humor; I laughed out loud maybe twice. Very early on, though, it becomes clear that we are supposed to be enthralled (amused? impressed?) by unrealistic gun play and explosive red blots, and that theme continues throughout. Christoph Waltz clearly enjoyed his role and performs it with relish and a twinkle in his eye. Every time he opened his mouth, I thought \"Richard Dreyfuss\"--I don't say that is either good nor bad, but to me, it was Waltz playing Dreyfuss playing this role. Jamie Foxx seemed to take his role too seriously, as the movie does not deserve it, or maybe he just doesn't do comedy well anymore (I seem to remember some funny bits on \"In Living Color\", but that was long ago.) Samuel Jackson played his role as \"house Negro\" well, but he didn't do himself much honor by taking it. There were some good cameos, particularly Don Johnson as a slaveowner in Tennessee, and Franco Nero as an Italian owner of a Mandingo fighter in Mississippi. Quentin Tarantino's cameo was ridiculously bad acting; he should refrain from putting himself in future movies. Leonardo DiCaprio's role as a degenerate slaveowner was generally well portrayed, from a stylistic point of view. I would say his character's dialogue was not particularly well written, but he has no particular cause for complaint, as bad dialogue prevails throughout, except for some ill-fitting attempts at intellectual discourse, which I saw as showy and superficial in such a mindlessly violent exercise. (I suppose the bad dialogue could be said to be intentional, but it earns Tarantino no credit.)What else? I don't object to the excessive use of the 'n' word, as it probably is realistic for the period. Unlike, say, \"Huckleberry Finn\", its use doesn't have anything profound to say about slavery except that some slaves would really have liked to kill every white person in sight (not too surprising, probably). The closest to something meaningful was when DiCaprio's character asks the interesting question: \"Why do the slaves not kill their masters?\" and doesn't answer it. Clearly many of the bad guys deserved what they got, but not all of them, and the script shows little discrimination (so to speak). The plot was tediously predictable, though I do admit I knew the outlines of it before I went in to see it. Tarantino's use of old-fashioned spaghetti Western titles, Nero, and the song performed in Italian (could get a nomination, if the field is weak enough) was probably his most interesting directorial motif, but it was neither surprising, funny, nor profound.",

This is another fine example of this genre and if you take it for that, you'll be sure to enjoy the film immensely.

There's good dialogue, decent action scenes and just enough of a story to keep you entertained for almost two hours. Sadly, the film lasts for almost three and would have greatly benefited from some serious editing. At some point, I just wanted it to end, especially when Tarantino's usual gore-fest took over in the last third of the film. If you are trying to find out whether you'll enjoy the film: that's quite easy. If you like any other Tarantino film, you'll like this one. If you don't care for his \"style\", this one won't change your mind. So really, it's just more of the same, solid albeit uninspired entertainment.",

Dr. King Schultz appears, he is looking for a man who can recognise three men called Brittle brothers. Dr. Schultz is not a dentist anymore, he is a bounty hunter. This is why Schultz want to find these brothers. They have bounty for their heads. One of the slaves says that I know these guys. He is no one but Django. He knows them because Brittle brothers persecuted Django and his wife. Thus Dr. Schultz and Django met. They make a deal which Django will be a free man after he helps Schultz to find these brothers. Some day Dr. Schultz learns that Django has a wife called Broomhilda von Shaft who is a house slave. After that day bounty hunting becomes a story which is about finding his wife and taking revenge. In general, the movie has original topic which keeps audience on the screen and incredible screenplay which fascinates us.\nMy favourite about the movie is acting. The cast is amazing even I do not have to mention about how good they are. We can feel every emotion while watching them. The fear that slaves have and how they change after they are unchained is worth to see. Persuasion skill of Dr. Schultz and how he treats to the guilty guys is impressive. Beside of this Mr. Candie's pressure with a skull was successful. Moreover, we can see Tarantino with a minor role. There are a lot of examples like these. Furthermore, musics and costumes are awesome. The people who prepared the costumes and who picked the musics are deserved to be appreciated. Literally I don't have anything that I don't like but I would like to see what happens next.\nAll things considered, this is a great movie with an unexpected script and gripping scenes.

That is also the point in the film where Christopher Waltz goes out of character. Coincidence? I think not, but despite my lack of adoration here, there are scenes that can't missed. The pre-KKK attack is a rewrite short of Blazing Saddles and every Waltz soliloquy or explanation of action bears witnessing at least twice. A Tarentino adventure always merits attention, but expectations here are planned resentments of either unfulfilled promise or, more likely, excessive non-sense. Over exposed violence served its purpose in \"Kill Bill\" and \"Inglorious Basterds\" but anti-slavery points were well made and preserved well before the blood sport took over.",

            "content": "Well I finally saw Django Unchained last night, and I've got some good things to say and some not so good things. First of all, I am a Tarantino fan...always have been ever since Reservoir Dogs. I know what to expect when it comes to his films. I expect a lot of blood, over the top violence, great dialogue, interesting characters, dark humor, and one heck of a story. And all of that was present in Django Unchained. So why do I feel like, somehow, Django missed the mark a bit. Well...and I never thought I'd ever say this about a Tarantino movie...I guess I wish he'd just restrained himself somewhat. For about 80% of DU, we have a masterpiece. At that point in the film I honestly felt that I may be watching Tarantino's best movie ever. And then something happened. Tarantino got in the way of Tarantino. And here's what I mean by that. 80% of DU is a classic buddy movie with some of the best interactions I've seen in quite sometime between characters. Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz (who, once again, gives the best performance in a Tarantino film) are brilliant. There was so much chemistry between them, that their growing friendship and partnership in the bounty hunter profession was the most authentic thing about the film. You honestly come to care for both of their characters. And don't get me wrong. There was plenty of ruthless bloodiness along the way, and as always, the violence was quite graphic. But then, with about a half hour, or so, to go in the movie Tarantino ratchets up the bloodiness to Kill Bill levels. Now, that type of exaggeration was fine in the Kill Bill movies. Heck, that type of exaggeration is fine in just about any Tarantino film except Django. Here I wish Tarantino would have pulled the reigns in. Because what was, up until that point one of the best movies I've seen in a while, just becomes more grind house, comic book-esque entertainment. Of all his films, this should have been the one where Tarantino said, \"This time I'm going to come at a film in a more serious manner.\" The plot certainly lent itself to such seriousness. I'm not saying there shouldn't have been any bloody violence. On the contrary, and again because of the storyline, a lot of violence should have been expected. And it was there. But then Tarantino turns the knob up so high, that the full-blast nature of the carnage actually gets in the way of this otherwise brilliant film. Now...all of that being said, I still liked this movie. There are so many things to like about this movie. But the ending isn't really one of them. Too bad...because what came before the preposterous conclusion was so doggone good. But, as I've said before, that is just my opinion.",

            "content": "Why you shouldn't see it:If you've seen Inglourious Basterds and thought once was enough, you're not likely to find much worth reviewing here. This is another of Quentin Tarantino's fantasy revenge flicks, of the sub- genre that rails on systemic injustices.Beyond that, there are a number of pretty obvious reasons that will probably jump out at you right off the bat, even if you haven't seen the movie. Most of these reasons boil down to whether or not you are comfortable with confronting humanity's occasionally (or frequently, if it's the deep south in the 1850's) ugly nature. This is a movie that makes white Americans uncomfortable with being white Americans in much the same way that Basterds probably made German non-Jews uncomfortable with being German non-Jews.This film unabashedly displays outrageous racism and almost cartoonish violence (frequently using the high visual contrast of bright red blood spattering on bright white set pieces). Two things that, like it or not, are prevalent recurrences in the way mankind has conducted itself through the years. If you like to close your eyes, cover your ears, and sing \"The Song That Never Ends\" when you're confronted with either of these things, because you like to think happy thoughts about the good ways in which people treat each other, this movie is not for you, and you will likely find it a tremendous waste of your time. Unless you really like singing that particular song, I guess.Why you should see it:It should be noted, however, that the way that Django and Basterds make an individual want to check his cultural baggage at the door is wholly unrelated to the way in which movies like Amistad and Schindler's List do the same thing. While the two Spielberg movies make you take a magnifying glass to our past somewhat against your will, the two Tarantino movies are more like your charismatic buddy who comes along and says, \"Hey, check this out.\"Django takes American slavery, shines a bright light on it, and hands it a microphone so that it has the opportunity to show what it's about. In a way that possibly only Tarantino can do it, the movie takes a dark subject matter and turns it so ridiculous that the audience can't help but have fun with it. Everyone in the theater found a measure of satisfaction each and every time a slaver died, regardless of the colors involved. The movie also adds a sort of vindication for those of you who saw Basterds and would have rooted for Colonel Hans Landa if not for your disparate stances on the right of Jewish people to remain living. Pretty much the same character seems to travel back in time to strangely play a more (his name is Dr. King) or less (he's a white German) proto civil rights advocate whom you can really get behind and cheer along.There are a couple enjoyable moments that sort of jarringly take you out of the main thread of the story with their surprising cameos and/or humorous observations on otherwise revolting situations. I'm not necessarily a fan of Jamie Foxx or Christoph Waltz, as I find the former unmemorable and the latter both lacking in range and somewhat creepy in the one role that he has settled into. But in this movie, Foxx does a good job of taking his dynamic role and morphing the character throughout the course of his story arc, and Waltz is more fun when he's \"on your side\" (which, ironically, is the side that kills people like you if you're white). I will say, however, that the acting highlight of the movie for me is Leonardo DiCaprio going largely against his type of controlled and almost closed characters in other movies to boisterous and cartoonishly evil in this one.In Short:I had originally started writing this post by going on a long rant about Quentin Tarantino when I realized I hadn't really said anything about the movie itself. And maybe that's the point. Most of you already have a pretty good idea whether or not you enjoy Tarantino movies. I ended up giving this one an 8 out of 10, and I recommend it as a good watch.Exceptions to the recommendation: if you're someone who knows for sure that you just don't appreciate QT's work (which probably means that you just don't appreciate film and the history thereof (and may God have mercy on your soul)); if you're one of those aforementioned people who sometimes struggles with harsh realities; if you're someone who sometimes struggles with revenge fantasies; if you hate seeing Quentin Tarantino try (active word) to act; if you're a white person who sometimes forgets to apply your filter and uncontrollably repeats things that you think are funny; or, by extension, if you're an impressionable young child... hold off for a bit, and I'll explain when you're older.",

            "content": "I've often felt that when Quentin Tarantino directs his own scripts the results are for the most part huge successes for critics and his admirers as well. When he has written something like Natural Born Killers, or True Romance, both of which were directed by other directors, they had some mildly interesting moments, but for the most part did not work. Here we have Django Unchained, which he has both written and directed and while I am a Tarantino fan, I have to be honest and say that it is the weakest, or at least one of the weakest of his films as a writer and a director. I was a little torn and undecided exactly what to say in this review because there were certainly parts of this new epic that I really admired and considered to be quite well done. On the other hand, there were parts that were terrible and an ordeal to sit through which made the film feel uneven and the 2 hours and 45 minutes of the film dragged, I mean really dragged. I could understand that he wanted to revisit familiar territory and make a spaghetti western with a combination of a blaxploitation film thrown in as well. Whether you like Tarantino, or not, you will have to admit that a lot of his ideas and concepts are borrowed from older, or basically other people's films. He seems to repeat and show the same type of story lines, dialogue and style in almost all of his movies, which I guess is paying off due to the high box office grosses of the films and also the numerous award nominations as well. Django, did not work because it tried to do too many things at once and on almost all accounts it failed. There were times when it tried to be humorous and it tried to set up a gag, or a punch line for amusement, but those scenes just felt so out of place and it didn't seem like Tarantino knew what he was writing and the actors often seemed clumsy and having difficulty delivering these lines and scenes. Instead of being interesting, or funny, or humorous as it's intentions were it just felt painfully awkward and like scenes that belonged in another way different type of film. I know I have criticized others droning on about the length of one's film before, but this time I can not excuse Django Unchained, because it's pacing and timing was all over the place and felt like an editing mishap and overall a mess. We have so many scenes that just do not work because they are written and performed awkwardly and they don't seem to have any clear purpose, or reason for being in the film other than to use up time. Take director Michael Cimino for example. Heaven's Gate has a scene that lasts a very long time when they are at the character's university early on in the film. The scenes goes on for a very long time, but has little to say and has no real relevance, or has any point, or purpose being in the film. It just drags. Same with his The Deer Hunter, which I like considerably more than Heaven's Gate, but what about the wedding scene in that film? The same thing. It goes on without any real purpose, or anything relevant to say. That is one of Tarantino's big problems with Django Unchained, it is almost like he wrote a bunch of ideas down on cue cards and when it came time to pulling together a script, he had to use every single last idea, note, or brainstorming idea he had and put them all in this film whether they worked, or not, or even made the film seem messy and jumbled. He didn't really seem to care. I have nothing against long films, or even films that have slower scenes in them, but they have to offer some kind of benefit to the film, the story, or the overall experience of the film. If not, having them in there just makes the film long, ambiguous and tiresome. There were things I liked about Django Unchained, particularly the supporting performances by Christoph Waltz (who continues to shine after Inglourious Basterds), Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. They are all at the top of their game here. One thing I really missed in this film that is more evident in other Tarantino films, is his flare for dialogue. My favourite scene of the whole film is where the main characters are sitting at a dinner table and Tarantino, creates tension and a mood because of his great knack of dialogue, what the characters say and getting these great actors to play it. I wish there had been more scenes like that in the film, but unfortunately there were not. The action scenes this time seemed a little too over the top and corny and a lot of the film did too, which further made me wonder what type of a mood Tarantino was going for. A lot of it just really seemed like they were trying to ham it up and be ridiculous, but those scenes were followed by others of extreme brutality and gruesomeness that didn't work either. I continue to admire Tarantino as a writer and filmmaker and while Django Unchained had a few honourable merits, there were not enough for me to call this a great film, or make me want to see it again.",

            "content": "Since Inglourious Basterds Tarantino's style has evolved and as a Tarantino fan, I am not very much glad about that. Unfortunately, Django doesn't feel like it is an old fashioned, classic Western in Tarantino style! It is rather an anti Western or a postmodern Western. I have not any problem with this directly, but for example by watching Kill Bill, you can get the taste of 80's karate or kung-fu movies, vigilante movies, by watching his friend, Robert Rodriguez's film Planet Terror, you can get the taste of horror B movies, exploitation movies etc. but you can't get the taste of spaghetti Westerns or old fashioned Westerns by watching Django unfortunately. One of the biggest problems of the movie is it doesn't take itself seriously, in other words, Tarantino doesn't take his movie seriously. The first half of the movie is pretty good, interesting, entertaining considering some little flaws, but especially the second half, the movie loses his appeal and becomes dull and even uninteresting at times. Before that, I want to mention that I couldn't buy the character Django itself. A slave who suddenly becomes a cool cowboy didn't work for me (in contrast with The Bride in Kill Bill) At the same time, I didn't think that Jamie Foxx added anything special to the character or to the film and as a cast choice, he was pretty bad. He was plain and simple without any spark like the movie itself. He couldn't an unforgettable figure in the movie and can't be even likable. Christopher Waltz was again the star of the movie, he steals the show from everybody, he was just great and he deserved that Oscar! I am sorry, but without him, the movie would have been almost unbearable for me. Di Caprio simply adds color to the movie without being a cartoonish villain. No word for Samuel L. Jackson. He is like a bulldozer in terms of acting! The movie was overly humorous at times like Basterds and I don't like that. Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and even Kill Bill were serious movies even if it has a certain amount of humor or funny moments. For example, in a scene Django wears a dress (it was blue as I remember) and as if it is made for laughs! In another scene, there is a \"mask\" argument and it is like you watch a Western parody! All those harm the movie little by little. With some postmodern touches and tricks like putting modern day songs into his movie, again, Tarantino tries to be different and the most important to surprise his audiences, to amaze his audiences, but if you ask me he fails. Instead of taking old classic elements and turning those into something modern in his hands like he did in Kill Bill, in this movie, he did something different which I would define as \"anti\". Also as said, the humor harms the seriousness of his movie. In the second half, when Di Caprio gets on the stage, unfortunately, the movie doesn't get better, just the opposite, it becomes uninterested and less exciting in comparison with the long first half. When they go to Calvin Candle's place (Di Caprio), somehow the movie lost its spark and also became less entertaining. May be it is because no \"Western\" anymore in the second half, instead a drama with lots of conversations and payoff! As said, Django is not a pure Western or a modernized Western, it is more like an anti Western or post modern Western. Welcome this \"a breath of fresh air\" choice, but in the end, it isn't a great, brilliant or that impressive film. Also I couldn't get that cinema feeling that other Tarantino movies have in this movie, especially in the second half. The another big problem of the movie was sudden, exaggerating and out of place violence scenes. After a slow paced drama, suddenly, the movie turns into an extremely bloody action movie. The blood effects were looking like red paint or a kind of superficial liquid which killed my suspension of disbelief totally. This is exciting! but also very superficial, exaggerating and out of place! I had expected some realistic, old fashioned but Tarantino style action, but couldn't find it. There is not any built up tension, no character conflict, no suspense etc. I can't say that Django was a solid or subtle film. The story editing of the film was problematic either. The movie starts like a revenge movie, but couldn't fulfill that, then it becomes a road movie for a short time, but it couldn't fulfill that either. Then, it becomes a drama, later suddenly action and it goes on. Also, the last one or two minutes of the film seemed me uninviting or subfusc. Django Unchained is Tarantino's Machete, a disappointing and uneven experience.",

            "content": "Imagine Quentin Tarantino is given the chance to direct \"Casablanca,\" a wonderful love story set against the backdrop of the beginning of WWII. It's an engaging story that pulls you into the plot and characters. You are on the edge of your seat near the end as Rick pulls into the airport to get Ilsa on the plane. Now, Major Stasser arrives and it looks as if all the best-laid plans will be thwarted, until . . . What's this? Rick pulls out a .45 and shoots Strasser in the head, blowing his guts and brains all over the airport. He tosses a shotgun to Victor who blows another Nazi in half. The pilot of the plane sees this and starts turning the plane toward Rick to mow him down with machine guns; but Rick takes out his bazooka and sends a missile into the plane, blowing it to smithereens. Rick turns to Ilsa, blood splattered all over his face and clothes and mutters, \"Get the F\u2014 outta here!\" He takes the cigarette out of his mouth and lights a fuse with it (who knows how it got there?) It burns down to multiple kegs of TNT and the entire airport blows up as Rick and Ilsa walk slowly (of course, slowly!) away. \"MF\u2014ers had it coming.\" Rick says as the screen fades to black. My! What a heart-warming story!I'm confident that's exactly the type of thing Tarantino would have done had he directed that classic film. I say this because \"Django Unchained,\" is a good movie about 2/3 of the way through, only to have Tarantino's immaturity, silliness, bad taste, smarminess, and a whole host of other unflattering adjectives pop out and ruin what might have been a good movie.The story is well-written and engaging up until the moment when Dr. King Shultz refuses to shake the hand of Calvin Candie. Then it goes so horribly wrong. Had another director taken control for the first part of the movie while QT was off at a self-congratulatory cocktail party? Did Quentin arrive at that point and place his unmistakable stamp of derailment on the film? Up until that point we had good characters, especially that of Dr. Shultz, who acted with forethought and precision to get him and Django at the plantation of Calvin Candie to rescue Django's slave wife. But, inexplicably, Dr. Shultz abandons his character and shoots Calvin. After this, the movie completely loses its moorings and wanders into a gore-fest, shoot-em- up, that strains credulity. Django can mow down legions of men with a couple of six guns, exploding balloons full of corn syrup and red food coloring to make surrealist messes on the walls, carpets, people, and anything else that might be on the set. This is supposed to be art, when it looks more like a couple of college fraternities having a red-dye water balloon fight. It's not the extreme violence that bothered me. It's that fact that it was forced\u2014yes forced into this movie where it didn't belong.Imagine the movie that could have been. Suppose Dr. Shultz begrudgingly shakes the hand of Calvin, then leaves with Django and his wife. They then hatch a plan to return to Candieland to get Shultz's money back and free the slaves on the plantation. He and Django return and sneak into the camp where the slaves are. They arm them and convince them to exact revenge on their cruel master. This enables them to escape culpability in the crime, etc. How much better and thoughtful a movie would that have been? This is the reason I have given this movie the lowest rating I could. It could have been good, but chose to follow the Tarantino formula of one-upmanship in gore, which was not the right path for this particular movie. I have enjoyed the over-the-top gore in some of his other movies. The Kill Bill movies and Inglorious Basterds were movies that used this violence effectively. It really didn't belong in this movie, though.But I have scratched the surface. There are other things very wrong with this movie. The language. Since when did plantation owners, slaves, lawmen, and all other characters in 1850's America become so enamored with the F-word, the MF-word, the SH-word, and all the other profanities you would expect to hear from degenerates in the inner-city or in a Tarantino movie. Remember, this was the era when saying the word \"leg\" was frowned upon. Lines such as, \"Melanie, please adjust your petticoats. Your limbs are showing.\" were common back then, using the term \"limbs\" because it was impolite to say \"leg.\" The language was completely inappropriate to this film and detracted from the time period in which it was supposed to take place.Not only was the language inappropriate, but the music was also. Has there ever been a score less suited to the material on the screen? I heard, spaghetti western music, Elvis impersonator, rap, hip-hop, 70's, orchestral, and other stuff I just don't know. What a mess! This was music calling attention to itself, screaming out \"Listen to me! See how artsy I am! I can exist in a pseudo-western! Wow! Ain't I cool!\" This was ridiculous. The music is supposed to enhance what's on the screen, not detract from it and call attention to itself.Those of you who think this movie is a masterpiece, please wake up and open your eyes. You are slaves and can't think for yourselves. You listen to others tell you how cool Tarantino is; so you just assume his movies are good without actually watching what's on the screen. I really think he's the most overrated director working today. Someday, this period of movies will be viewed from a historical perspective and people will scratch their heads in wonder as to why the public and the critics found these movies so enticing. I give Django my lowest rating. Oh what might have been!",

Also i wonder if the movie mirror the real social schemes and relationship between black and whites before the American civil war I have been also impressed by the figure who Samuel Jackson plays. The black that become strictly connected to the master. How much in that times the social schemes drove the people's mind. Also tells the story of the internal conflicts and contrasts between blacks themselves The title also plays his important part. I thinks that he wants to say that when the blacks have been have given the freedom it could have taken big changes in the society with all the troubles and dangers the freedom involved but it was a necessary and important human step in the history. This movie helps not only to learn the past America but also the present? Maybe? Everywhere in the western world the blacks have been misused mistreated displaced beaten and abused oftheirs lives. That explain a lot their social disease now. A really nice movie, a strong look at the errors of the pasts, in order to figure out some feature the actual world. Bad or good they are, is the world we are living . There is some italy inside. A famous Italian actor Franco Nero plays the part of a man who bets on mandingo fights . He spoke in Italian. Also, Tarantino gives space to the German language, to make understands that the culture can be a prerogative of a slaved person, also. And some reference to French culture as well..etc..culture, languages, all of this breaks barriers. And is very powerful.I would add that the level of the actors is totally amazing.",

Not much is held back with Tarantino in charge of this modern-day spaghetti western. Strong graphic violence and unlimited use of the N-word.

An impressionable and strong minded slave called Django(Jamie Foxx)is freed to trek across the country with a determined bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz(Christopher Waltz). Django is actually trained by the former dentist to be a deputy bounty hunter with the sole purpose of finding his wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington), who is actually a favorite slave of cruel plantation owner Calvin Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio). Vicious fighting, a fair share of nudity, no-holds barred language makes for a strong raw R rating; you shouldn't expect any less from Tarantino.

            "content": "Director Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is certainly the most original story, set before the American Civil War and the emancipation proclamation (1863) that freed the slaves, about two unlikely bounty hunters, Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) and former Django (Jamie Foxx), who spend the entire film hunting down and killing white southerners who broke the law. Yet this film's strengths are matched by its weaknesses, leading to only a marginal thumbs up for me.The strength of the film is partly in Christopher Waltz's delicious performance as Schultz who deftly combines great civility with truly sociopathic behaviour. In retrospect, it is a shame that we did not get to see more of Waltz and less of Foxx in this picture. Leonardo DiCaprio also delivers a brilliant over the top (but regrettably short) performance as the villain slave owner, Calvin Candie. There is a certain irony in the fact that Candie calls his estate, \"Candyland,\" given how horribly the slaves in particular are treated there. DiCaprio, who is obviously a gifted actor when given rich parts, creates a character that is flamboyant, unapologetically sadistic, and displays incredible energy. He is a marvel to watch. Beyond that, director Quentin Tarantino also should be credited for making a film that, in the first hour or so, has a sense of humour about the farcical situations that its characters are in while, at the same time, using graphic violence to illustrate the savage racism of the ante bellum South. Doing both those things at once without appearing in bad taste is something of an accomplishment.Yet this film has significant weaknesses as well and its third and final act in particular was a disappointment to me. To begin with, Jamie Foxx is actually quite boring as the main character Django, which would not be so much of a problem except that the whole film is about him. Far from doing anything interesting with this role, Foxx can only regurgitate his slick, charismatic performance from films, like \"Stealth.\" So when the camera is just on Waltz or DiCaprio, I did not really miss Foxx. Another problem was Kerry Washington's performance as Django's \"wife,\" which has to go down as one of the dullest performances of a love interest in the movies. Finally the other major flaw in \"Django\" is that its plot, especially towards the end, becomes too farcical and too absurd. The film's third act plays like an exploitation film, using very graphic violence and bloodletting to entertain rather than to underline the savagery of racism and slavery. One wonders whether Tarantino lost his inspiration by the time he completed two-thirds of the script and simply tacked on an ending that exemplified the tired and worn out formulas for other action pictures that use graphic violence to jolt the audience.",

Django's character makes everything even better. He is definitely a hero, but he's slightly complicated hero. Usually roles like that are made for white actors, but there's no way to make this story about a white man. There are too few heroes that aren't just white men, especially when we're talking about roles where the hero is forced to act against his beliefs. Meaning Django had to pretend to be a black slaver, and he did his part and seemed almost merciless, and even when you know that's just for his plans, it is awful to watch. The love angle is a good add for this story. Of course the revenge theme is very strong here, but the love story of Django and his wife Broomhilda is definitely a nice touch. Maybe the audience doesn't get to see romance that much, but it gives a sort of softer feeling to this.Violence in Django Unchained has two reasons: there's the violence that the slaves face. And that's something that definitely shouldn't be left out. Slaves were treated horribly and that's a fact, and seeing that violence on screen makes it harder for people to not talk about it. And then there's the violence where Django gets his revenge, and those are amazing. Firstly there's the catharsis - the bad guys get what they deserve. Secondly, film is a fantasy. One guy fighting ten or more guys and surviving is impossible, and we all know that, but it is thrilling to watch.It's impossible to talk about Tarantino's films without mentioning the music. Once again, I loved the soundtrack of Django Unchained. It felt different compared to the other movies I've seen, but it was still good.Django Unchained is definitely amazing movie.

I expect to connect with his characters, but not necessarily like any of them. I expect to see a film that satisfies the film geek in me. More than anything, I expect to see a film that entertains throughout the prerequisite bloated running time.\"Django Unchained\" is nearly three hours long. But it never feels that long, it entertains and surprises every step along the way. When I first checked my watch, we were already two hours into the film. All of Tarantino's films are usually about this long. Tarantino has been having fun with fictionalizing historical periods lately. This started with 2009's \"Inglourious Basterds\", which was easily one of the best films of that year. My eighty-something year old grandmother, who lived through the time that the film depicted - World War II - said that if events actually happened as they did in that film, that we would be living in a better world today. I think that's a pretty high compliment, especially since my grandmother is not Tarantino's target audience. He was able to design a great story - not an idealistic view of that time period, but still a pretty fascinating one.\"Django\" is about slavery...a taboo subject in any film, a strangely popular one, recently, as the same time period is explored in \"Lincoln\". It's about Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is bought and then freed by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz, one-upping himself from the fantastic performance he gave in \"Basterds\"), a dentist turned bounty hunter. White supremacist slave owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) bought and enslaved his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), and Django and Schultz are out to correct the grave injustice done to both of them, and this doesn't mean just capturing and killing Candie, but many others who are responsible for the trauma experienced by Broomhilda.Christoph Waltz has got to be one of the finest living actors in Hollywood. He's incredibly charismatic, but he cares about his character, first and foremost. As the prime antagonist in \"Basterds\", he was positively horrifying. In this film, he's the hero, but at the same time, he's anything but that. He brings humor and depth to a character that wouldn't have worked this well otherwise. Jamie Foxx does a good job as well, but I don't necessarily see him winning anything this Oscar season.I'm half-tempted to call \"Django\" Quentin Tarantino's superhero movie. Django is by no means that, he's an oppressed figure with no real \"super powers\", however he's a kick-ass guy who the audience roots for from the very beginning. He even has his own theme song! We don't know how he appears to be more literate than other slaves, and he is somehow always able to outsmart those around him.\"Django\" shows Tarantino having slightly more respect for genre than he ever has. It's a western revenge epic, first and foremost. It's also kind of a comedy, with some of the most clever dialogue I've heard in a film in 2012. It's also a romance, displaying the forbidden love between Django and his wife. But it's first and foremost a western, and Tarantino sticks to that.This film isn't perfect, however. One thing I expect from Tarantino is well-developed strong female characters. We don't have that in \"Django\". I was hoping that Kerry Washington, who is also badass protagonist Olivia Pope in ABC's \"Scandal\", would be smart and strong-willed enough to get herself out of the problems which are out of her hands. I was hoping for Tarantino to give her some snappy dialogue, to show that her character is, like Django, superior to all of the other slaves around her. She isn't. She just kind of stands there and whimpers. She's helpless, and I wasn't expecting that from Tarantino, who has written some of the best female protagonists in film.Other than this, \"Django Unchained\" is a masterful film. It takes a lot for a nearly three hour long film to be engaging the entire way through, and it is. It's wickedly funny, and at the same time, extremely dramatic. With its graphic violence and filthy mouth, it isn't for the faint of heart. All of the actors here, especially DiCaprio, seem to be having tons of fun here, and it shows. Tarantino loves to fictionalize history, and if such films are as good as \"Django Unchained\", I think he should keep doing it. It's a vision of history that only Tarantino can bring us.Grade: A-",

Those who also yammer on and on about what a fantastic role Christoph Waltz plays have obviously to me never ever visited a Disney Store, because he seems that his acting style would fit in nicely with that particular franchise.

It is has a great script, is incredibly well acted, and it goes without saying the direction and cinematography are outstanding. Set in 1850, this 'Black Western', is the story of a German bounty hunter, who helps a freed slave to rescue his wife from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner. In his typical, Tarantino-esque way, the master film-maker amuses us with his dark, blood-curdling humour. In graphic detail, he reveals to us the horrendous barbaric cruelty of the darkest times in American history \u2013 the slave era.Particularly noteworthy were the performances of Jamie Foxx in the lead role, Christoph Waltz as the German bounty hunter, Leonardo DiCaprio in a spellbinding performance as the brutal plantation owner, (his best cinematic performance up to that point by a million miles), and Samuel L Jackson in an outrageous over the top 'Uncle Tom' performance as Stephen - Di Caprio's faithful slave-servant. A host of brilliantly played cameo roles also added to the overall quality of this 'must see' movie.I'm not claiming this is Tarantino's best movie- Pulp fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill 1 take a lot of beating. But none of those excellent, ground-breaking movies received any Oscars, so why indeed should Django Unchained? Frankly, I can't answer that, except to state the obvious \u2013 Tarantino has never been accepted by the Hollywood community as one of their own \u2013 in spite of his movies' universal popularity and wide critical acclaim. Was it ever thus? To this reviewer, he is right up there with the best. Go and see it and be entertained, be shocked and see something that might shake you out of your lethargy.

And his trademarks are noticeable throughout--from the spaghetti western style opening to the use of varied musical styles. I was let down, however, by the film as a whole. There were multiple instances of long, drawn out scenes that seemed to be intended for style and emotion, but resulted in a pointless, tiresome straying from purpose. And character development was sorely lacking. Chris Waltz's cold, methodical, calculating, bounty hunter is all-of-a-sudden nauseated by witnessing death at the teeth of dogs. But he shouldn't have been. His character should have seen it coming. And he certainly shouldn't have so openly quivered. I think the intent was to strengthen the Django character at that time, but it wasn't believable. Also unbelievable was the ultimate climactic scene where DiCaprio and Waltz barter for Django's wife. The movie hinges on this conflict, but it was a farcical clash since either party could/would have gladly resolved the dispute. Candie would have gladly taken $12k for the \"$300\" girl. And the Dr. would have gladly paid for what they came there for in the first place! I understand that pride and besting one's opponent comes into play, but it's not believable that either man would have sacrificed themselves at that point of limited personal investment. The scenery and costumes were as good or better than other Tarantino ventures, but I felt the lack of the signature Tarantino dialogue. Maybe the argument over the eye holes cut into the masks of the raiding party approaches the Reservoir Dogs argument over tipping waitresses, but that was sadly about all.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Django Unchained",
            "content": "Quentin Tarantino, by now, will be synonymous with taking genres and giving them his unique spin that blends pop and cinematic culture with vulgarity laced dialogue and plenty of blood spurting action. It's almost as if he started out wanting to pay homage to his favourite genres, only to find himself adding a new and separate dimension to those films with his trademark signature style. And with each film he now commands bigger and better known stars to draw crowds to the Tarantino-verse that seemed to bear no limits, as the writer- director-part-time-actor had now gone on to pick up his second screenplay Oscar in recognition of his writing.But Django Unchained would probably be his most straight-forward narrative yet, without genre-bending nor adapting vastly different styles in his film, playing it very straight and to the point. In his earlier films, his most engaging scenes tend to be the ones that is dialogue or monologue laden, where characters banter incessantly, and most times irreverently to what is the situation at hand, and this not only draws plenty of attention, but are extremely engaging to sit through. countless of gems have been introduced in this fashion, which sadly this one didn't have many of. That's not to say that it's notches down, but is an element that's sorely missed.While many will go on about how violent the gun-play in Django Unchained is with its bucketloads of exaggerated blood spills and splashes, and over the top gun wounds when lead rips apart flesh and bone, what made this close to three hour film work, lies in the characterization, especially with many playing against type. And it doesn't hurt to have Christoph Waltz in your corner as well, and making an entrance that's as chilling as that in his debut Tarantino work Inglourious Basterds. Here, Waltz plays Dr. King Schultz, a dentist turned bounty hunter, and a damn effective one at that, with his surprises and relentless ability to smell out opportunities. He plays mentor of sorts to Jamie Foxx's Django, a slave whom Schultz set free, and partners with, much to the chagrin of the Southern community at large, to go after a slew of wanted men, raking in the cash as well as getting closer to Django's sole objective at this point, to rescue his wife Broomhilda von Schaft (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of the egomaniac Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).The plot's easy to follow given Django's prime objective, that's paved with bounty hunter adventures through set action pieces, and comedic moments, such as Tarantino's making fun of the early version of the Ku Klux Klan, and the plenty of cameos such as Jonah Hill, and Franco Nero of the original Django fame, amongst others. These action sequences are effectively done to a perfect blend of blood, gore, and comedy rolled together. There's no question that these are elements that gone honed over the years from Reservoir Dogs right down to this film, with the filmmaker being unapologetic with his defined style, and being very comfortable with it. Those stand offs in the film are probably the best that Tarantino had tackled, and are well worth the price of an admission ticket. The writing continues to be impeccable as Tarantino develops his scenes and how his characters interact with one another, making each episode incredibly engaging and filled with high tension, especially from the last act when everything comes together in a volatile melting pot.While Jamie Foxx makes an excellent Django with the silent D in his fish out of water ways who discovers he's a crack shot, it's quite clear that Leonardo DiCaprio stole the latter half of the film with his rare villainous turn as the Southern plantation owner who couldn't care less of his slaves, enjoying the high life with that sadistic streak of always wanting to win. Samuel L.Jackson was also a delight, being probably the only actor to date to have worked in the most number of Tarantino films, to stamp his presence as Candie's trusted man servant who at times seem to call the most shots. It's L. Jackson like we've probably never seen him before, and in a role that's on par with some of the best he had played throughout his career thus far, with unbelievable dialogue being spit out from his mouth, and sharing some excellent moments opposite DiCaprio.Some may have lambasted Tarantino about how racist this film is, but after sitting through it, you can't help but feel they're a little jealous in not having been there first. A solid story, a great cast, and plenty of stuff to engage a variety of audience demographics make Django Unchained probably the most accessible Quentin Tarantino film to date, and I'd highly recommend it for what it achieved, a tribute to chop-slock entertainment that continues in the same vein as his grindhouse features.",

Yes, we see them killing a wanted criminal, but it's just a minor piece that is referenced later in the film, rather than a plot point. A more substantial use of the idea would have benefited the film greatly.But while it's got plenty of style, it ultimately lacks substance. Whilst watching it I was mostly entertained, but by the end it had left no impression on me. I recognise that it's only meant to be light entertainment, but the film left me wanting something more. There's plenty of southern racism, and Di Caprio plays the villainous Candie very well, but the film really lacks any sort of emotional core.There's no cheering for the good guy because despite the evil baddies, the good guy barely acts at all. Jamie Foxx is so devoid of any sort of emotion it's hard to know if he's even got a pulse. The other characters are paper thin and lacking any sort of depth.

An absolute phenomenal feast of sheer acting brilliance compact into 165 minutes of western adventure is DJANGO UNCHAINED. Events occur in a time 2 years before the gi-normous civil unrest in the States. Django (Foxx) a black slave is bought off by Dr.Schultz (Waltz) from the prying hands of two slave traders. Dr. Schultz who is retired 5 years now from dentistry is a bounty hunter of the state and requires the assistance of Django to identify the Brittle Brothers who have a handsome bounty set on their heads. Django who agrees to assist Dr.Schultz does so in true Western-Foxx craze convincing me that Will Smith was wise to turn down the role because no one will play Django better than Jamie Foxx.Acting is indeed integral in any motion picture. The performance of the actors in this movie is more fundamental than any other movie of the recent past since the DJANGO UNCHAINED isn't about a variety of occurrences put together. Instead the movie follows Django every frame of the way making the audience involuntarily focus on the same set of actors which opens a window of opportunity to zero in on the vulnerabilities in the character portrayals. The best part is that there are no flaws, there are no hiccups. Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel Jackson and Christopher Waltz are jaw droopingly dazzling. I kid you not; there are moments in the art of the way some scenes are directed that I literally have my jaw drop only to embarrassingly notice it minutes later. One must try real hard to not like DJANGO UNCHAINED.Special note must be made for the Oscar winning performance by the Austrian Actor Christopher Waltz. Strangely enough that I could not stop myself from thinking that he sounded an awful lot like John Malkovich if he was to play to the same character. There is not a moment of boredom when Waltz delivers his lines. Evidently he is in full swing with his portrayal and coincidently he manages to bag in 2 consecutive Oscars with 2 consecutive Tarantino collaborations.Lastly this movie is a great comeback for Quentin Tarantino as his fans begin to wonder if he had burned his imagination with KILL BILL and PULP FICTION.

This being a Tarantino movie, going from point A to point B is done in an unconventional way which makes it hard for the audience to guess exactly what happens to the main characters (this is a good thing). Along the journey, we are treated to Tarantino's style of writing and directing: mimicking some camera movements of the 1970s; copying the look of the film stock of the 1970s; and the rich, expansive, mostly witty dialogue.Although Waltz and Foxx are the main characters, it is the relationship between DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson (DiCaprio's head slave) that is the most interesting. The roles of master and slave seem to switch back and forth at various times, and I believe many viewers will be very puzzled by this; but it's really simple \u2014 the DiCaprio and Jackson characters go way back, and the decades spent living together obviously led to a mutual respect, trust and love for each other. They have essentially become father and son.My most memorable, movie moment of \"Django Unchained\" is the scene when Foxx is hanging upside down, completely helpless; and one of the bad guys is about to castrate Foxx using a red hot knife! Tarantino fans won't be disappointed with this movie, as it has everything you'd expect from a movie written/directed by him. Although part satire, and therefore cannot be completely taken seriously overall, the movie's depictions of punishments of slaves are very disturbing; and disturbing people is something Tarantino doesn't shy away from.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",

Secondly, the music. Are you kidding me? It was the worst and poorly chosen soundtrack ever. It was so unfit for a Western movie. Then there was the excessive use of the f-Word. It just lowered the movie down to a pathetic level.As for the cast, well I will say that Leonardo DiCaprio surprised me here with a rather good performance. The movie was really well-carried by Christoph Waltz, as he was just amazing. Samuel L. Jackson was also quite good. And it was enjoyable to see him in a role such as this. And Don Johnson was such a gem in the role they had given him. But as for Jamie Foxx, no, just no!It was an adequate storyline that would have made for an excellent movie, had it not been for some really, really bad choices and things which sent the movie spiraling down into mediocrity.",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino is one of the most celebrated writer/director around and a great example of someone not needing to go film school to be a successful filmmaker. His long awaited remake of Django, Django Unchained, was a high anticipated film and it will satisfy his large fan based.Set in 1858 in the South, Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave who ends up being freed by a German dentist turned bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz who needs Django to identity three brothers for a bounty. If Django agrees Schultz promises to help the former slave his freedom and find his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) . Schultz's trains Django and finds that Broomhilda was brought was a vain and sadistic plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo Di Caprio) and have to come up with an ambitious heist to free her.Like Inglourious Basterds Django Unchained is a very loose remake of the film it is based on. It is also pure historical fiction and a fantasy in its look and approach. But does provide everything you would want and expect from Tarantino film: there is his trademark witty dialogue and menacing monologues, extreme violence and bloody action and plenty of humour. It supplies on a number of fronts and tonally and approach wises it was very much like Inglourious and both Kill Bill films.Tarantino knows how to write engaging characters and cast great actors to fit the roles. Whilst Foxx is the title character Waltz was the real star of the film. Schultz was intelligence man with witty lines and dominated scenes he was in. A great touch in the characters of Django and Schultz is that it is Schultz that is most shocked by the cruelty of slavery because he is not used to it. Django starts of a very unsure character who is not educated and grows over the cause of the film into a Clint Eastwood esque character.Di Caprio famously rejected the role of Hans Landa in Inglorious Basterds which he regarded. He took the role of Calvin Candie to make up for the mistake and he delivers a good performance of a character who wants to be civilized and sophisticated yet really a barbarian as he enjoys watching men fight to the death. He made for a charismatic and has a great relationship with the head house slave, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), someone who he treads with distain, but Stephen is deadly loyal to his master.Django Unchained is genuinely funny with great jokes and physical lines throughout. My personal favourite moment was the satire of the Ku Klux Klan as they end up having a massive argument. But Tarantino also know how to keep the tension and drama up as well and whilst the action may not be on the same level of Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds, it is solid fun and feeds a bloody lust.Like with many Tarantino films there are film references. There are some moments that are parcelled to Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds (particularly Calvin Candie compared to Hans Landa) and there is a distinct B-Movie feel and look to it. Tarantino wanted to make a Spaghetti Western and there is clear references to the genre because of the art direction, costumes, the violence and the camera moments. Two other references I picked up on were to Birth of a Nation and to a scene in Full Metal Jacket (but played for laughs). I am sure there are more which I would see on future viewings.The biggest complain I have is the length and it felt that it needed tightening up. It was the final act where Tarantino let the film drag: he need a producer to tell him that he could have merged the final sequences together.On the whole Django Unchained is a highly enjoyable film that was well written and directed for the most part and has great characters. It will pleases fans and only the most harden Tarantino critic would dislike the film. It's not Tarantino's very best, but even his weaker films are still worth watching.",

            "content": "After the critical and commercial success of Inglourious Basterds, I often found myself wondering whether director Quentin Taratino would top his 2009 effort. It seems like he did in the form of Django Unchained. If you're a big Taratino fan, this film will deliver. While it features lots of violence and blood, the film often stays light-hearted because it has lots of comedy here. Taratino still has his knack for dialogue and he the script he wrote is just amazing and the dialogue is just perfect.Taratino directed a film that features a time when slavery was still prominent in the American South. This film is about a bounty hunter named Dr. Schultz who frees Django and Django joins him in the bounty-hunting business. They come up with a plan to rescue Django's wife from a slave owner who goes by the name of Calvin Candie.If you want to see incredible acting, this is the movie to see. Leonardo DiCaprio surely had a gutsy role and he delivers tremendously and it's one of his finest career performances. His scene at the dinner table was just fabulous and so abrupt. Very good performance. He is rivaled by Christophz Waltz who once again delivers an excellent performance and eerily similar to his role in Basterds. Jamie Foxx delivers a strong performance and has some of the best one-liners in the film. Also, Samuel L. Jackson added some clever comedy here to lighten things up.Overall, I don't know whether to call this Taratino's best movie since he directed many high-quality films like Basterds, Pulp Fiction, and the Kill Bill films. But if this is the way to get people to like westerns again, so be it. It's not historically accurate of course, but this is not meant to be. This film has plenty of gore, guts, and violence and any Taratino fan will be happily satisfied. I rate this film 10/10.",

This movie did not need to be so brutal, cruel and frankly insulting.Almost 3 hrs was way too long for this type of movie. While the story was sort of about good guys and revenge and all that jazz, it all seemed to be just a mere backstage for sadistic fascination with blood, guts, violence and repeating \"nigger\" every friggin' second. Some say it was \"humane\", I did not see anything resembling humanity.

The music is, in my opinion, totally inappropriate for the genre, place and time in which the story is set, and often for what is happening on the screen, and it very distinctly stands out from the film. On the other hand, music is excellent and fiercely enhances the effect of the film. The music is in a perfectly harmonious discord. Madness.10/10",

Maybe the best one since Unforgiven.It is a film that is not without its (minor) flaws yet it is a movie that is truly unique and original. You could argue that while it is Tarantino's first Western, all his previous films were already Westerns of sorts. Which does not take anything away from the fact that this film feels fresh and novel. Not only because there is an obvious comprehension of the grammar of the Western genre, but also because by setting the movie in the South just before the Civil War.It is refreshing to see a movie being so bold with the issue of slavery. Not only is it mentioned and discussed, but it also deconstructed. We see the economics of it, how culture revolves around it and how it permeates almost every facet of Southern life. The film shows that when you had slaves you talked about slaves, you had to manage your slaves. The characters Candie and Big Daddy spend all their time exclusively talking thinking and worrying about slaves.Yet, the writer's genius, of course, is that slavery is woven into the story. It is not something just mentioned: it drives the plot forward. Slavery is an element characters have to take into account into their actions. It is something that is seldom seen in these types of movies. In Westerns, usually the hero is more or less a white knight. Here the protagonist is more of a weapon. Django is a wedge against history. Yet, it is also a weapon against the classic clean Westerns. It is almost as if you took the boldness and subversion of the Spaghetti western and applied to the Spaghetti Western genre itself.The ultimate genius of the Italian Westerns, was not the gritty-ness, nor the realism, nor the music, nor the fable-like aspect of their stories with good guys and bad guys and a moral at the end. Although they're all integral elements and they are present also here. The true genius was the outsider look they had on the American myth-making. The true Spaghetti-Western is a subtle satire of a certain idealised version of American-ness. Here, Tarantino re-appropriates this, so to speak. It is the American version of it (even though a lot of it goes through Schultz who is specifically a foreigner). It is a true American story, told by Americans, and as such it is unique and significant. Unforgiven also showed the discrepancies of the romanticized West vs. Reality, but it did have the sarcastic humour nor the did it confront the issue of slavery.It may also be Tarantino's most clever script in terms of dialogue and plot. Dr. Schultz as a bounty hunter is fantastic. So is the scheme he and Django hatch up against Candie. There is a real care in showing how life in the Antebellum South looked like and how the Western institutions functioned.The minor flaws would be that the action is somewhat uneven. There are great sequences, and some memorable ones. But there is not anything instantly cult classic, like in his previous movies. It is kind of a nitpick and I must insist that the movie is brilliant, but it is the sort of thing that jumps out on a rewatch. Also the music was a bit lacklustre, except for the opening titles. It was not bad, but it could have been better.",

While he is undoubtedly a stylish director and a writer who has an ear for dialogue, he also has a taste for trash and a fatal tendency towards overindulgence - I don't subscribe to the \"Tarantino is a genius and his films are masterpieces\" school of thought, because the flaws in them are so manifest. It was in this frame of mind that I approached the near-3 hour, spaghetti western homage that is Django.This, too, is not without its flaws, but its breezy good humour, notwithstanding its subject matter, is infectious, and it is a most enjoyable movie, not to mention often being visually quite beautiful.I could leave it at that, but I think I need to mention the elements which, in my view, didn't work that well. One was the music - Tarantino's tendency towards musical selections which might not be the most obvious choices often works well: for me, here, the music was often unhappily inappropriate. Two is my reservations about Jamie Foxx as Django. I appreciate that, as a slave looking for his enslaved (and probably suffering) wife, and given the part he was playing within the part, there was no reason for him to be happy, but he struck me as rather one-note sullen. Three was the violence which was played for laughs - Tarantino did this in Inglorious Basterds, too, and I'm really not sure I am comfortable with it, particularly when it sits side by side with equally graphic violence which is not meant to be funny (D'Artagnan's death) - boundaries get blurred. Finally, the ridiculous bloodbath in Candie's house was the most self-indulgent sequence in the film. Perhaps he feels it's expected of him, perhaps he just likes doing it. I felt that less would have been more.But all this fades next to the three things I loved. One was the dialogue - at its hysterical best in the sequence where the Regulators are arguing over their hoods. Two was Samuel L Jackson's malevolent Stephen (a character I have a great deal of trouble figuring out: his mixture of Uncle Tom-ism and equal partner status with Calvin, and his fabricated limp, are never explained). And three is Christoph Waltz's gleeful and grandiloquent Schultz - just because you are doing something unsavoury in a repellent time, place and society, doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy yourself, right? I continue to be extremely impressed by Herr Waltz.",

We were the last to leave the cinema, as we paid proper respect and sat until the very final credits finished - we were rewarded for same ( unlike those other people with ants in their pants, who had to check their phones & depart immediately the film proper ended - more fool them, but hey it was nearly midnight on a rainy night in Katoomba). When we eventually left our seats and stood outside, my mate said \"I think we've just seen 5 movies\". My reply was \"...it's probably more like 10\". I began to list the various narratives: the Seigfried saga; the Spaghetti Western; the Deadwoodish muddy, bloody realism; the essay on sadism & cruelty - with artefacts ( not just the usual ankle chains but the hideous devices placed around people's necks - this I might add is the common or garden, public display of how the bodies of slaves were paraded & transported, what lurks in the dark corners of private property is even more disturbing); the power politics of small town snapshots; the comedy; the horror movie; the ode to the American landscape; the performing horse movie; the Downton Abbeyesque gaze on the Candyland dining room; the buddy movie - I could go on and ever on.What I had witnessed was a movie so carefully crafted by a writer/director at the top of his game, that it's left me with indelible marks on my soul and I like that in a movie. It's one of the ones that stays with you, the images that haunt, the lines that make you laugh out loud, the horror that makes you put your hands over your eyes and put fingers to keyboard in praise. I note that other reviewers have found it messy, long, unfocused etc. Maybe they just don't get it. Perhaps they have no knowledge of Gilgamesh, Homer or Virgil, but that's life you can't read everything, see everything, know about everything. When I was a kid, movies were often 3 hours long - with intermissions, especially the epics. If you want a 90 minute action movie - go watch T Cruise, but will remember a word he says? Maybe, the cinema is a broad church and everyone has their own devotions & ideas about entertainment or art or both.The film is so rich in stories and characters that it's practically impossible to select a favourite - it's like reading Dickens, there's a whole body of other work that supports what we've been offered to think about. Django is undoubtedly the coolest hero but he's got his buddy Doctor S to inspire him. It's a chicken and egg thing. Has Leonardo ever displayed more villainous instincts? Did I ever think I'd see Franco Nero on screen again? How 'bout Don J as Big Daddy? These are just fragments of delight. The real gems are Kerry Washington's face when she knows that Samuel L Jackson's Evil Stephen is on to her (the tension is unbearable) or when Jamie Foxx gets to pick out his own clothes for the first time - that electric blue outfit is still slaying me, or those fools with the bags on their heads - a beautiful portrait of white supremacists at their idiotic best.Christoph Waltz stole so many scenes, it's impossible not to love every minute of his performance and for his character's ultimate sacrifice - it made me feel complete. The German doctor decided on a fitting departure because he couldn't resist. I must congratulate Quentin on his Oz accent - I was worried for a moment that he was going to slide down the Seth Efrican side of things but happily he'd chosen John Jarratt to play against, which lifted his game considerably, classic screwball comedy - downunder style! A hoot. All the other categories of the film: art direction; casting; costumes; cinematography; editing; sound; writing and directing are sublime. It's my BEST PICTURE of the year - so who gives a fat rat's what the Academy decides?",

            "content": "If ever the Spaghetti western was to enjoy a short revival in the 21st century, Quentin Tarantino would play a crucial role in kick-starting the great sub-genre. Today's Hollywood directors will never in a million years rival the visionary genius of Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah, although Tarantino has had a darned brilliant try and has in in the case of this particular movie, succeeded. As everyone knows, Django Unchained isn't a Spaghetti western, rather a profound love letter to my personal favourite sub-genre which borrows heavily from the ideas and execution of certain films within that sub-genre. Tarantino, being the expert he is in Italian cinema as well as a true Spaghetti western aficionado, is probably the only individual in Hollywood who can create a western which echoes the polished ability of Leone, Castellari and Corbucci and hence introduces a younger audience to such amazing movies.I'll start on a simple point. I beamed with delight when I saw the 60s era Columbia logo at the film's outset. A little touch or attention to detail like this really conveys the director's strive to be unique and the presence of the logo itself is also reflective of the era when westerns were at their best. I was also extremely impressed when the logo faded and I could hear the familiar twang of a guitar as the credits opened. That's right, it was none other than Luis Bacalov's Django theme from the 1966 classic and Tarantino couldn't have chosen a better song to signify the arrival of this excellent movie, even the title font was the same as that of Corbucci's original-I'm loving the film already!. Other brilliant Spaghetti compositions that are featured include Riz Ortolani's Day of Anger, Bacalov's His Name Was King and Franco Micalizzi's Top of the West(from 1970s They Call Me Trinity)among a few other sublime pieces by Morricone himself. The connections created by these tracks between this movie and the original Spaghettis made it all the more special to me. Audio clips from various other Spaghetti westerns were also inserted into the end credits music which was also quite touching. I thought Jamie Foxx was terrific as our eponymous anti-hero and Christoph Waltz was on inspiringly charismatic form as dentist-turned-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both made for compelling protagonists who I'm sure Leone or Corbucci would be proud of. Leonardo DiCaprio dazzled as crazed plantation king Calvin Candie, his frenzied discharge of rage and brutality during the sequence at the dinner table was a real force to be reckoned with in one truly electrifying scene. I think the best performance in the movie came from Samuel L. Jackson as Candie's loyal manservant Stephen, the part was underplayed by Jackson fantastically. It was also refreshing to see the man himself Franco Nero in a cameo.Tarantino continues to live up to his bloody reputation with the superb action scenes. The riotous shootout inside Candie's mansion was absolutely insane!, the amount of blood exploding from men's bodies as they were shot was crazy!. Until now I have never seen a movie in which the same individual is repeatedly shot so many times over. The sounds of the bullets cutting through the air as well as the blood pouring from the wounds only adds to the realism. The shootout was truly spectacular and showcases just how big a maniac Tarantino is(I mean that in a positive way). There's also a chilling scene where an escaped slave is brutally ripped apart by a pack of bloodthirsty dogs as well as a slave fight which is executed with vicious extremity. The film's ending is awesomely kick-ass and mirrors a true Spaghetti western finale. Django Unchained is a pretty quotable movie and the sequence with a large group of horsemen arguing over the fact that they can't see through their floursacks-cum-hoods will raise a decent chuckle.With lashings of deliciously grim humour, Tarantino's pseudo-Spaghetti western is also a comment on racism. Either way, it is a highly enjoyable adventure and a trip I am more then willing to make again. 9/10",

For those familiar with Tarantino, expect a lot of flamboyant dialogue followed by gun shots. This could be one of the best films lately, mainly because it is not that \"Tarantined\". It almost feels like a normal movie if it weren't for all the talking and seemingly inadvertent humour.Bottom line: this here is a Western, no doubt about it. With Tarantino's unmistakable style added for fun and a black guy as the hero. The stellar cast helps as well: Jamie Foxx, Leo di Caprio, Samuel L. Jackson (in a role that only he could have possibly carried out that well) and, of course, Tarantino as a cameo in the smallest role possible. Kudos to me for recognizing James Remar in both his roles and always expecting to be a connection between the two characters. But there was not.",

I am so glad I did! When a movie draws you in from frame 1 to the very end, that's great storytelling. This film proves that you don't need any gimmicks Hollywood shovels at you to immerse you into a film when good storytelling fares better than any gimmick you can throw out there.I don't even know where to start. I guess I can start with the performances. Let's just say the performances were so good, that I got lost in the characters. Jamie Fox, who is a very talented actor, actually got me worried because at first I thought that any actor could play that role. But as time went on, I can't imagine any other actor who can pull that performance off as well as he can. Christoph Waltz proves that you can never say that actors these days are bad. He is incredible, as always! The biggest surprise to me, however, is with Leonard Dicaprio who plays a very mean businessman, and he played it so well that I even forgot that he was Leonardo Dicaprio. I believed his character. And wait until you see Samuel L. Jackson. He was hilarious!The story was riveting. It follows two bounty hunters (Waltz and Fox) on a mission to rescue Fox's wife from a corrupt businessman. The journey there is pure filmmaking genius as this is what a film is supposed to be. It conveys all kinds of emotions and when its funny, its laugh-out-loud funny, and when its suspenseful, you are at the edge of your seat. Honestly, this is what films should be and definitely a testament to what a great film-going experience is supposed to be.I honestly can't believe it took me this long to see this movie and glad I got to experience it at the theater. Next time, when I hear good buzz like that, I should listen. I was actually thinking this film was going to be boring. I was so wrong this time and I'm the type of guy who would never admit it. Best film of 2012 and most likely at the top 10 of all time for me!",

Very much a Tarantino film, delivering homages to the genre in the same manner as \"KILL BILL: VOL. 2\" and \"INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS\"; however, this addition to Tarantino's impressive filmography as director/writer is possibly the least dialogue-driven, even more so than \"KILL BILL: VOL. 1\". To some who did not care for or are not familiar with \"RESERVOIR DOGS\" and \"PULP FICTION\", this may not be a disappointment. On the other hand, viewers/fans who are very much familiar with Tarantino's style of making full use of his actors' words, expressions and interactions\u2014a style which has gained him much praise\u2014might be slightly let down that \"DJANGO UNCHAINED\" is more about visuals and less about emotion. Well-acted, with plantation owner DiCaprio and his head slave Jackson offering the most memorable performances. Foxx is great, but delivers an interchangeable performance; and Waltz is more than charming, but his talents are put to very similar use as in \"INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS\". Neither Foxx nor Waltz should be criticized as they obviously gave it their best; perhaps the problem is that the two lead roles are two-and-a-half-dimensional characters\u2014not quite two-dimensionally dull and not quite three-dimensionally gripping\u0085 they are both caught in that invisible world between script and screen.

            "content": "Once again, Tarantino manages to remind me some of the reasons I love cinema without losing accessibility even a little bit.Django Unchained follows Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave whose freedome is bought by the German dentist/bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (the legendary Christoph Waltz). After Django helps Schultz in his work (which was the original reason he bought Django's freedom), they both decide to work together for the winter, and then go and free Django's wife from her current owners.Like I said before, I love this film. The soundtrack is pretty great (it has some goofy songs here and there but I do think it fits the film well), as I've learned to expect from Tarantino. The cast is absolutely legendary. Samuel L Jackson, Waltz, Dicaprio - all of them totally slay their roles, in the best way possible. (Yeah, Foxx is also really good here, though I can't say his acting is as legendary as of the ones I've mentioned before).The plot is very well paced, and though there are some minor points that feel a bit weaker in that aspect (especially after the first act and towards the very end of the movie) I can't say that it's a big issue, really. I also love, love, love the cinematography. So many beautiful shots, symbolic moments that have deepness but are still quite accessible.Slavery is a concept that's so ridiculous, and the film emphasizes that point in a variety of awesome ways.It's also genuinely funny, thrilling and even moving at points. Can't not-love it.So, to wrap it all up, I'd say that Django does what it aims to do very well, both on a technical level and the ideological level. It's a fun, smart and well crafted film, and I honestly don't think that I have a single major criticism towards it. I'm feeling an 8.6/10 on this one.",

Second, let me say that I will not be attending anymore of his films in a theater. Third, \"Django Unchained\" is not a bad movie, in the same way that \"Birth of a Nation\" is not a bad movie. All these things considered, this is one of my least favorite movie experiences of all time. It completely lacks substance, with the exception of ketchup and corn syrup. There are few things about this film that I actually enjoyed (Christoph Waltz being one exception.) The rest? I can say little in its defense. Instead of making a statement about America's brutal history of slavery and its atrocities, \"Django Unchained\" rolls around the filth under the excuse that \"its a satire,\" \"its comical,\" \"its making a statement,\" \"its a parody,\" \"its campy.\" NO. (these are not acceptable excuses)Tarantino should not get to do this. A great movie could have been achieved, but he made damn sure to cross that line. In the absence of any real moral message, social statement, or will to style, Tarantino has continued to rely upon ultra-violence to win him points with audiences and critics. If Tarantino wanted to keep me interested, I would recommend he cut the laughable redundant gimmicks that he has fallen back upon time and time again.Please.I am tired of seeing someone getting their junk blown off in every Tarantino movie. Its not shocking anymore, its just repetitious. And his signature scenes of extended dialogue are no longer witty, nor do they keep my mind sharp in between the ever escalating blood baths.So please Mr. Tarantino its time to make a new movie, not just a more violent version of the one you made last time.",

I was pleased with the actors who were very convincing in their roles. Jamie Foxx was a very brave and mean Django, but you wanted to see him win out. In a sense, Christopher Waltz was there for decorative purposes, but he, as King Shultz, was able to get his job accomplished. Leonardo DiCaprio, as Calvin Candie unlike the loving, caring person he was in \"Titanic\", was a mean and heartless plantation owner who loved to see brutal fighting. Kerry Washington, as Bronhilda Van Shaft, was a very appealing lady, and whose heart would not go out to her? Samule L.

This time there is one German good guy carefully picked unlike Inglourious Basterds (I believe he is trying to fix previous movie's anti-German reputation somehow.)Leonardo DiCaprio performance is the best in movie for me. Also Christoph Waltz performed very well. But Leonardo proofs he is a real star and can handle any role in its best manners even in such empty hole he was doing some real role.So movie never deserve such high points as general quality. Yes it is 9 to 10 point for a Tarantino classic movie but not for a good movie.

And this Django-character here actually proves that point: since they simply didn't refuse to be slaves, the black man's only hope was that there would emerge some kind of miraculous black superhero who could overcome and kill all the white people. Of course there never did. It was only the white man who had the power to took and eventually give back (well, kind of) their freedom. And only because it was the white man who came up first with e.g. powerful industrialism and agriculture the things weren't other way around completely (\"for some reason\" the Africans were never much of a threat for Europeans but Mongols and Ottomans among others definitely were).By the way, how did Django the Slave learn how to read, shoot a gun and use a whip like a pro only Tarantino the Writer knows.All above said, Waltz is very good once again as expected and even Foxx of which I never liked too much in other movies (\"Ray\" of course being an exception) performs OK in his \"impossible\" role.

He is the Yang to the film's Yin, filling out the missing part of the scenes and even providing a human perspective into what's happening when the audience does not what to feel in certain situations. Whenever Christoph Waltz is not in the movie, it is heavily felt.Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin J. Candie is a great villain and brings a scary presence. Scary is something we haven't ever seen Dicaprio accomplish so it was quite fresh to see. He sings Tarantino's dialogue, projecting a charming demeanor on the surface while carrying a constant petty evil underneath. It's not Oscar worthy (if anything, he should have won for The Aviator) but a powerful performance nonetheless.Jamie Foxx's lead performance as Django seemed off to me. Particularly his voice threw me off because his inflections sound too modern. Everybody else seems to have an accent from the era, but he does not use a southern accent, or any accent. He just sounds like a black man from 2012. Django's progression of intelligence was unconvincing to me as well. There were times where he seemed dim-witted and other times where he seemed sharp, and it felt unnatural. It is not a screen writing issue, but in how the performance was delivered. It was as if Foxx focused on playing the \"Man with No Name\" western genre hero and did not know how to balance it with the historical context of black slaves in America. He just did not carry enough pain in his eyes.I don't have words for Samuel L. Jackson's performance, it's quite the spectacle to behold. Watching it transported me into a weird nether place. Maybe I need to go leaf through a history book on slavery or something. I don't know what to make of it. And on that awkward note...However one may feel about Tarantino's frequent use of the N word, he definitely has a strange obsession with it. As horrible as this sounds, I was surprised how other racial slurs from that era were not spoken in the film. (I am not going to name them here. I will defer you to watch that scene in Clerks 2.) There is a quality in Tarantino's crass, in-your-face direction that suggests that he gets off rebelling against social taboos. That telling him that something is politically incorrect will push him to do it in order to disprove you. That's my speculation anyways.The film is way too long. Simply put, it's ill-disciplined in the sense that Tarantino wants his cake and eat it too. He wants to tell his story and communicate a statement but also wants to amuse himself by inserting things that he enjoys and cannot reign himself in. There is a gag where a major comedy star shows up in a cameo which I found problematic. In fact, it was problematic in the exact same way I found Mike Meyer's cameo was in Inglourious Basterds. In a film where it's trying to balance historical fact and a post-modern aesthetic by mediating film genres, seeing a modern comedic actor show up for a cheap laugh is just one extra layer too many and it took me out. Did the gag make me laugh? No. Did it progress the story? No. Then why is the gag there? Tarantino wants it to be, that's why.A reason that I prefer Django Unchained over Inglourious Basterds is that Tarantino doesn't try to make every scene into a dialogue set piece. The opening set piece in Inglourious Basterds is the best thing Tarantino has written (he says so too), but every proceeding scene seemed like he was trying to recreate that for the rest of the movie and it got tiring. There is a point in the Django Unchained's final act where the story could have concluded but it proceeds for another half hour. I could have cut 20 minutes out of the film and it is that exact 20 minutes that holds the film from being something masterful. Yes, that includes Tarantino's cameo. Tarantino shouldn't act in his own films. Maybe he shouldn't act at all in anything but he was the worst part of his own film.All that said, I enjoyed it much more than Inglourious Basterds ( I am so relieved it didn't end with a character uttering \"Hm, maybe THIS is my masterpiece.\") Tarantino fans may love the extra fat, but I would have preferred a leaner steak with more discipline. It's just that little difference, if only Tarantino reigned himself in.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",

Now he had Christoph Waltz back and was working in one of my favourite genres. It should've been a sure-fire winner. I think my disappointment with Django is entirely due to my mountain high expectations. I expected it to blow me away every second, hold me in its palm like Basterds and take me off guard. Unfortunately, while it's still great, it can be predictable, it can be slow and it can be contrived. Sometimes it follows similar circumstances as Basterds and it simply doesn't build or payoff any suspense. It's a shame that these moments aren't as great as I expected, with the evilness of the antagonists being over-hyped especially. I still love the concept but it was approached in a way which although I kind of expected, I hoped it would grow from there. It's a sloppy film and revels in excess from beginning to end. I need to give it another viewing with adjusted expectations as the film certainly works as a homage but not as what I wanted it to be. There's a lot I like about it, like the performances and humour, but there's also a lot of missed opportunities where the direction Tarantino did take it may grow on me later. I just feel like it highlights where Basterds succeeds so well rather than Django's own qualities.8/10",

            "content": "Set in 1858, a slave named Django (Jamie Fox) is freed by Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz), a bounty hunter who is after a gang of brothers. Taken under Shultz's wing, Django learns the trade of \"killing white folk and getting paid for it.\" Things take a turn when Shultz vows to help Django free his wife (Kerry Washington) from a ruthless plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo Dicaprio)\u2014a very sweet sounding name. Rescuing her though proves much harder than it seems. Breaking away from Quentin Tarantino's normal form of storytelling, \"Django Unchained\" is broken up into 3 main acts. The first is the relationship between Django and Shultz, and their adventures. The second is about the Candie plantation and the mission to rescue Django's wife. The third act is the final conclusion. Tarantino does a masterwork with the first two acts. But by the last 40 minutes, the final act drags on much longer than necessary for Tarantino gives us 2 bloody shootouts vs. the typical one. The ending result is obvious. The extended ending and extra carnage is pointless to the overall story. 30 minutes could have been cut from the time length. No doubt Tarantino did this on purpose since he felt his audience had not seen enough death and destruction. When people die in this film, they not only bleed, they spray out gallons of blood and scream as loud as possible. While over the top, it borders on unwatchable. Shootings, beatings, whippings, torture \u2014every thing but rape is present in this movie. If it weren't for Quentin Tarantino's name, this film would have probably garnered an NC-17. Tarantino does make up with witty conversations and comical situations that poke fun of the South as a means to lesser the sadistic, violent load. What works exceedingly well in this movie is Tarantino's choice of actors, especially Christoph Waltz, who practically steals the show. In comparison to his Oscar-winning work for Inglourious Basterds, Waltz gives us a surprisingly likable character that has a moral compass\u2014unlike most Tarantino characters. He is a man to admire and his mannerisms as well as the witty script makes him deliver a wonderful performance. Leo Dicaprio's portrayal of Calvin Candie, however, is the polar opposite to Waltz's. One minute he is charming and the next he explodes like dynamite. Dicaprio has truly broken his norm of playing good guys and he does so with panache. Jamie Fox seemed a little apathetic in the start of the film, but as the plot progresses, his character flourishes and his anger becomes more and more understandable\u2014and we root for him as he takes on the racist southerners. Samuel L. Jackson makes a surprise appearance as Candie's adviser Stephen. It is more than obvious that he is just having fun with his role; he incorporates as many black stereotypes as he can. The only downer is Kerry Washington. 90% of the time she either looks terrified or screams. No doubt, much of this is to blame on her poorly developed character\u2014she's just a victim, nothing more. After while though, her ear-piercing shrieks of pain grow very nauseating. Much of Quentin Tarantino's visual works well for this film\u2014especially him hiring Robert Richardson as the director of photography. Richardson's use of natural lighting, slow motion, and unique camera angles is something to admire. I particularly like the fast zooms on actor's faces during scenes of tension and quick cuts to reveal flashbacks and violent action. Other trademarks of Tarantino though do not work so well. Blaring hip hop/rap music and pop culture references may work for films like \"Pulp Fiction\" and the \"Kill Bill's,\" but it feels a bit out of place with a film about the south prior to the Civil War. There are a lot of ways people may interpret this movie. Many will see it as a controversy to due to its graphic violence and depiction of racism. Lesser mind people may see this film as offensive and deems all southerners as evil individuals. Others will see this as another, mindless gore fest. Some may even see it as a satire of slavery, plantation owners, and the South in general. For me, I see it as another fun movie by Quentin Tarantino. So, bashers and offended persons, take this movie as it is, a movie. Unfortunately, his usual trademarks and references are hit and miss, and his story drags unnecessarily long towards the end. \"Django Unchained\" is far from a masterpiece, but I appreciate that Tarantino has made another movie.",

The eye candy and music are good through most of the film. But at candy land, which is halfway through the movie, things turn grave plot wise. A deal so elaborate, nobody ever would come up with, guns blazing, one more useless turn of events, only to justify some more guns blazing and gore, for no purpose or meaning at all. With it's main topics, slavery and segregation, this movie had a chance to transport some message or meaning, but all it does, is utilizing those main themes for pure entertainment reasons. In a way, Tarantino abuses those themes to make money, and you should find out for yourself what you think of it. For me Tarantino finally made his way into the bread and circuses league. If that is what you are expecting, it is your movie.In short:copy a generic blaxploitation movie, borrow on a known character, use serious topics like slavery and segregation, blend in some eye candy and good music, and you have Django to make you some money.

            "content": "It's taken me a while to write this review. There was so much hype for Quintin Tarantino's latest film, Django Unchained! My disappointment in the film was so overwhelming, that it sent me reeling into a week-long depression. When I watched the trailer, it looked like it would be a good movie. Then I saw Spike Lee's reaction, and it had me reconsider. I began doing some research, watching some of the films that influenced Tarantino, one of his favorite films, \"Mandingo\" and the Norman Wexler penned Sequel to \"Mandingo,\" \"Drum.\" \"Drum,\" is almost the same film with Ken Norton in the same role for Norton, basically. These films made a lot of money. Interestingly, Norman Wexler went on to write the hugely popular \"Saturday Night Fever.\" So, it's no secret that the Blaxploitation film Movement of the 70's was heralded by white writers and directors who's stereotypical notions of \"blackness\" blend savage and often extremely violent depictions of black life, and cash in big at the box office. Does it sound familiar I also re-watched some spaghetti westerns, westerns that were shot in Italy and Spain by Italians, sometimes with a few American actors, on very low budgets and often scoring with a huge profit margin at the box office. I watched \"Death Rides A Horse,\" and the original, \"Django,\" is also available in its entirety on you tube. Then I think I made the mistake of reading Tarantino's original script. The original script has a very long, brutal gang rape scene of Django's wife Broomhilda, played by Kerry Washington, and in the original script, Django is murdered in the end. So I went into the screening expecting to be completely outraged, but also feeling excited that Hollywood had made a film so offensive to the Black community, that there would be outrage and it could possibly spark a new wave of filmmakers making much better films about our history and current state of being. Nope! The film has been reviewed and reviewed and reviewed, so I'm going to get right to the point. My problems with the film are this: 1.) The n-word is used 110 times. 2.) Django, played brilliantly by Jamie Foxx, can only become heroic with Dr. King Shultz, played by Christoph Waltz, the white savior character's help and belief in him. 3.) Absurd graphic violence, heads exploding, a slave being torn apart by dogs, a woman being shot and sent flying back 20 feet... this is all just bad taste in my opinion. Things are so much more powerful when they're suggested and not shown graphically... 4.) They put my man Sam Jackson in black-face to play the \"uncle tom\" character. Damn! He isn't dark enough already? He has to be darker to play more evil? What's up with that? 5.) Broomhilda, Kerry Washington's character had like six lines in the whole film. What? A sister don't have no opinions or responses to share? Jesus... it was like a non-part for an actor of her caliber. They could have just gone ahead and cast a video vixen if they just wanted a mannequin. 6.) The depiction of the slaves is generally of an ignorant, slouching, defeated characters. Slavery was brutal, especially in this country in the south, but it's been documented by historians from the period like Pierre De Vaissi\u00e9re and Baron De Wimpffen that enslaved Africans were extremely intelligent, crafty, clever, resilient, powerful human beings. 7.) Slaves fighting to the death is a complete fabrication, created by a racist lens in the slave narrative films of the 70s and made more graphic in this film. 8.) The overall experience of watching the film was unpleasant. The actors are good, the soundtrack is good, but the tone of the film was drenched in a certain vulgarity and void of soul quality that I found offensive. 9.) The scene where Django is about to have his balls cut off, I felt, was a mental castration to the Black men in the audience. 10.) The fact that folks in the small town in Texas were outraged by seeing Django riding a horse was completely ridiculous as it's pretty well known that between 15 and 25% of cowboys were Black. 11.) I see audiences reactions often being somewhat racist, depending on who's in the theater. If it's a predominantly white audience, they laugh at things like Django putting on a top hat. What's so funny about that? Top hats were in style back then, suckers! There is a lot of laughter for white audiences and very quiet reflection by Black audiences. 12.) I could go on and on... but I won't. So, overall, I felt like the film is extremely toxic for young viewers, gives a distorted sense of history, was bad taste and has gotten a lot of undue praise. Django Unchained creates some satisfaction for Black folks who see a brother kicking butt and not taking any crap from white folks, killing many of them brutally, often in cold blood and it's an outlet for our collective rage... to a degree. White people who watch the film get to feel morally superior to those backwards slave holders via the German bounty hunter who has a much greater command of the English language than that native speakers in the film. What is the effect of all this graphic violence on our minds? I'm one to believe its part of why there are so many shootings in this country. Seeing 300,000 murders on TV and in the movies by the time we're 18 years old can only make such violence seem like one of our options of behavior. Does this film open the dialog for a discussion of slavery in this country? Perhaps for some. But ultimately I feel like it does more harm than good.",

            "content": "With having become a fan of the Spaghetti-Western sub-genre since seeing Antonio Margaritti's sadly overlooked Supernatural Western And God Said To Cain (1970-also reviewed),I began to hope that his attempt to bring the \"Django\" character back to the screen,would lead to Tarantino rediscovering his old charms at high noon.View on the film:Leaving behind the \"missing\" reels,chapter breaks and intentionally gorier cuts for \"international\" audiences,writer/director (and cameo acting) Quentin Tarantino (QT) brilliantly uses the movie as a way to take a back to basics approach,and go from making movies that \"Characters from my past films would go and see\" to instead create a new film which is filled with distinctive characters who can proudly stand out from any of his past works shadow.Kicking things off straight away with Django and King meeting within the first 10 minutes,QT uses the near 3 hour running time to slowly build up the friendship between the two bounty hunters whilst also making sure that the goals which the two leads want to reach (for Django:finding his wife,for King:finding the Brittle brothers) always remains at the front of the film,as a smart device to keep the story strongly on track.Setting most of the last hour in one location,QT allows his new characters to do the talking,with Calvin Candle and Stephen (played by Leonardo Dicaprio and Samuel L.Jackson) both being tremendous villains who are just kept on the right side of crazy,whilst their counterparts Django and King are both eccentric's in their own way,whose weirdness help QT finally rediscover the cracking,knife sharp dialogue which has been missing for some time.Along with showing a new eye for elegant wide shots that fully show the breathtaking locations which look to have come straight from a 60's/70's Spaghetti Westerns,QT also sprays stylised blood across the films tense shoot outs,which along with a great soundtrack that combines sweeping classical with tough Hip-Hop drums,turns each of the action set pieces into adrenalin pumping moments as the redness of the blood intensity's as Django unleashes shot after shot.Taking on the famous Spaghetti Western character who got his start in 1966 with Franco Nero (who has a very funny cameo in the movie) in Sergio Corbucci original,Jamie Foxx gives a good performance that has real swagger from the very opening of the movie.Sadly,whilst Foxx does bring the swagger and charm,he sadly lacks any fire or passion in his eyes which this iconic character deserves,with Foxx mostly delivering his lines in a laid back style,which almost make it sound as if he is not in a particular rush to find his wife!,and also leads to the other characters pushing him to the sidelines,that ends up making Django looking like a supporting character in his own film.Sizzaling from the first moment he appears on screen,Christoph Waltz quickly turns King into the star of the film,thanks to perfectly delivering the dialogue with a relishing wit,and also giving a sly thoughtful side,as King's interest in helping his new friend,and also getting revenge on the people who have used slaves increases.Kept off screen until the final hour,the three main villains show that Tarantino has been saving the best for last.Making the most of his small screen time,Walton Goggins (who gave an astonishing performance in the TV series The Shield) gives a good,gritty performance as Billy Crash,who sees slaves as nothing more than things which should be hunted & killed.Teaming up with Samuel L. Jackson's amazing performance as Stephen (who despite being a 70-80 year old character,is given crisp dialogue which smoothly allows Jackson to give Stephen the cool and loud charismatic element that only Samuel \"Snakes on a Plane\" L. Jackson can give.Leonardo Dicaprio takes on a role that easily could have become a cartoon villain,but is saved by Dicaprio giving Calvin J.Candie a real mean streak,with a scene involving Candie breaking a skull being the best scene in the movie,as Django reaches the end of his patience,and starts to become unchained.",

I thought it was definitely helpful to have a turncoat type character such as the one Samuel Jackson played.The action scenes were intense, gory, and crazy.I do believe one way the film could have been improved is if he had additional motive for revenge. While it does seem to be a revenge film, the main brunt of revenge seemed to be more fitting for the three brothers killed earlier on. I think it would have worked better if the final enemies were the three brothers. The final revenge being on no-names and on Samuel Jackson, while action packed, didn't seem to be satisfactory as a revenge on the three brothers would have been.Even if the final revenge was on Leonardo, I still feel the three brothers would have made a more inspiring tale of vengeance. In addition to this, I felt a better Rocky style training montage would have not only pumped you up more, but also give you a more logical and realistic sense of his desire for revenge and training to become better. His slave to supreme gunslinger ascension was realism breaking.Overall, a good movie which could have been even better.",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino has a style that is stylish! Few can outdo him for over the top blood and guts treatment of a subject matter that is inherently not funny. He knows how far he can push the limits and gathers together some very fine talent in all aspects of his creation. DJANGO UNCHAINED is certainly one of his finest efforts to date, and that is saying a lot. But a writer/director who can tackle a subject as heinous as our history of slavery and show all aspects of it - as vicious and cruel and inhuman as it was - while at the same time pepper it with outlandish parody and humor is a genius of cinema.Everyone knows the story of the film by now so a very brief statement is for openers: The time is two years before the Civil War and slavery is big business in America. Former dentist, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz who is actually the star of the film in a brilliant portrayal), buys the freedom of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), and trains him with the intent to make him his deputy bounty hunter. Instead, he is led to the site of Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by the smarmiest of villains Calvin Candie (Leonardo Di Caprio in an astonishingly fine turn out of his usual character), a ruthless plantation owner. How we get to Candyland via taking advantage of bounty hunter murders and money and finally arrive in the gross estate of Candie run by his own black master Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson in a brilliant cameo) in order to free Django's wife in a wily manner may take almost three hours but there is never a portion that is dull or that fails to introduce new highlights to the story.In addition to the 'main characters' this film abounds in spectacular cameos by such fine actors as Don Johnson, Franco Nero, James Remar, Walton Goggins, Dennis Christopher, Ato Essandoh, Sammi Rotibi, Russ Tamblyn (yes, that one!), Bruce Dern, James Russo, Michael Parks, John Jarratt, among many others, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself. There are scenes such as a gathering of a Western KKK gang with maladaptive hoods that are incredibly hilarious, and scenes of torture and violent blood-gushing shootouts. It all works and even for the easily offended this is a film that entertains while it reminds us of a period in our history which is unutterably shameful. Grady Harp",

This film shouldn't be called Django Unchained; it should have been called Tarantino Unchained. There were times during the film that I just could not watch what was happening. On the other hand there are also some very funny moments; mostly delivered by Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz). As seen in the trailer, the doctor needs help in finding some criminals with a very high price on their heads; however he has never seen them. He enlists Django (Jamie Foxx) to help him hunt these men down and soon fully employs him as a bounty hunter. In exchange, the good doctor will help Django to retrieve his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the mega-plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Running the \"big\" house on Mister Candie's plantation is Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) who is as loyal as they come and disturbingly dedicated to his master. Django is totally transformed from a down-trodden slave to a self-reliant pistol carrying sharp shooter. I also just want to say that there has been so many films where Germans have been portrayed as the \"bad guy\" so it was refreshing to see one that was a good guy. I would be remiss if I did not mention Big Daddy (Don Johnson) who somehow made me think about fried chicken because they dressed him up to look a little bit like Colonel Sanders. The violence in this film is not the only shocking moments; there are some things that are better left not shown (you'll know exactly what I mean once you see the film). It seems like really long movies are starting to become the norm and this film is no exception, although you are so engaged in what is going on in the film that this one did not feel that long. This is a true Tarantino film and you will get exactly what you expect (and then some). In classic Tarantino fashion, he takes you from one extreme (disgust) to the other extreme (laugh out loud funny). This spaghetti western will definitely take you on a roller coaster ride for sure, so buckle up. Even though there were times that I was shaking my head and turning away from the screen, I am going to give this film a green light.",

I love Tarantino but he picked the wrong actress to play this part. Tarantino's style (exaggerated, showy, extravagant and excessive) is all there before us, and he killed it with all the other actors - yummy, yummy in my tummy.The plot is about the search that Django, a former slave who is unexpectedly released and becomes a bounty hunter, will do for his wife, a slave who was sold and disappeared.

            "content": "What characterizes a Tarantino movie, in his own words, REVENGE. Indeed, when interviewed a few years back, Quentin Tarantino expressed his ambition to be known for the guy who makes the best revenge movies; well, he certainly does revenge with flair. Being a walking talking encyclopedia of movies, Tarantino has studied the movies and the audiences reaction and he plays to those very well. He also loves to make small homage to movie makers that have influenced him in one way or another and in Django Unchained, he used the theme of the 60's original series of Django movies; even Franco Nero, the original Django in the 1966 movie that bears the name title, has a role in this Tarantino movie.Christoph Waltz is, and should be, grateful to Tarantino for making him an almost common name in the biz now, certainly a recognizable actor. Since his role in Inglorious Basterds that brought him to prominence and now an Oscar for his role in Django, this Austrian born actor delivers absolutely choice dialogue as only he could. Waltz's role sold the film to me; that's not to say the performance delivered by Leonardo DiCaprio was not an outstanding one because it was, and I'll bet he enjoyed the role of the bad guy. He was terrific in it.Tarantino's film humor is witty and selective, so there isn't an abundance of it, as it would deter from the main plot; the only thing Tarantino movies has in volume is violence, oodles of it, and this film is no exception. Another trademark is that his violence is often creative to boot; that's the case here. I'll not spoil it for you by saying how; it just is.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Tarantino's score and tune selection as another notable trademark; it just doesn't go unnoticed, period. Samuel Jackson and Michael Parks, regulars of Tarantino, add to the terrific cast of characters in the movie. I haven't watched a Tarantino movie I didn't like; Inglorious Basterds was the least of my favorites though, but since Waltz played in it, I include that film in the 'like' category.",

            "review_title": "Probably the most action packed Tarantino film",
            "content": "This is a southern/Western that compacts quite a bit of action, good dialogues and superb acting although it can be slightly over the top. But that is Quentin Tarantino's characters trademark. But in a way it lacks some strong substance that is in Tarantino's early movies and seemed to rely a bit more on the violence than a well better crafted characters. The characters are memorable to a degree but just lacked substance and the motives and why they strive for it to such a extent isn't all that clear. But in past Tarantino movies it's like that but it had better dialogues. Also the violence in this movie didn't seem well grafted into the story and scenarios while not leaving that big of an impact. I wouldn't say pointless but it has been done better in previous Tarantino films and way more memorable. I am not sure if Tarantino got some ideas from \"Sukiyaki Western Django\" a Takashi Miike film that Tarantino made a cameo appearance in. Which is a really western comic book style movie and although \"Django Unchained\" is better some scenarios seemed slightly similar. Unlike previous Tarantino movies though this one doesn't go in a messed up orders from what happens story wise but goes in a chronological order with few flashbacks. Some of the few characters that has strong presence in this movie is Django Freeman(Jamie Foxx) who is the least interesting one although he is the main character. But still glad Will Smith didn't get this role. Dr. King Schultz(Christoph Waltz) who plays a fake doctor bounty hunter who oppose slavery and no not the shoe doctor. Christoph Waltz nailed it as the Jew Hunter in \"Inglourious Basterds\" and he really stands out in this one as well. Than there is Calvin J. Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio) who is this really evil and sadistic slave owner on a plantation called Candyland. In fact his character appear more ruthless than the Jew Hunter although the Jew Hunter probably killed more jews. But Candie's certain actions makes him appear like a really ruthless prick. And DiCaprio pulls it off, I don't know but he always does a fine job with these ambitious business like characters that is full of way too much pride. Samuel L. Jackson is also in this and he plays a brown noser for Calvin Candie but he is a badass brown noser if there is one and he has the most keen sighted character in this movie although despicable. But I can fully understand how some audiences would be offended by this character. What is interesting is how Django and Dr. King Schultz show there relationship in a way where Django is the dominant one to Calvin J. Candie. But behind closed door it's Stephen who is the dominant one to Calvin J. Candie. Stephen sorta reminded me of Uncle Ruckus from \"The Boondocks\" and wouldn't be shocked if Quentin got his inspiration for one of his character from Uncle Ruckus. Another character that some viewers of that show would find offensive. Don Johnson also stands out a bit as a racist plantation owner that goes by Big Daddy although he doesn't have that many scenes. Despite few flaws this movie seemed to pass by pretty quickly although it's almost 3 hours long and wasn't bored with it at all.8.6/10",

            "content": "'DJANGO UNCHAINED': Five Stars (Out of Five)Quentin Tarantino's homage to spaghetti westerns about pre-Civil War America in the South. Basically it's a slave revenge tale done in B western movie style but it also tackles some serious issues from America's horrifying past. The film stars Jamie Foxx in the title role of a freed slave turned bounty hunter who teams with the bounty hunter who freed him (played by Christoph Waltz) in order to rescue his wife. It co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson. The movie is ultraviolent and as disturbing as hell but it's also highly entertaining and a great example of cinema at it's finest. The movie opens with a bounty hunter posing as a dentist (his former profession), named Dr. King Schultz (Waltz), tracking down a slave by the name of Django (Foxx) as he's being transported across the country by his two slave owners (James Remar and James Russo). Schultz purchases Django (by force) and makes him a proposition. He wants Django to help him track down his current bounty, the Brittle Brothers (who Django knows), and in return he'll give him his freedom (as he despises slavery). After Django helps him kill the Brittle Brothers Dr. Schultz makes him another offer; that if he stays on as his bounty hunting partner he'll help him track down his wife, Broomhilda (Washington), and free her. Django is a natural shot and reluctantly becomes an expert killer as the two find his wife; staying under the ownership of a ruthless plantation owner named Calvin Candie (DiCaprio).The film is Tarantino at his very best and delivers plenty of stylized visceral action as well as smart and intriguing dialogue. The characters are as rich and thought out as you could possibly expect from any film (yet alone a B western) and what happens to them is as emotionally involving as one could possibly anticipate from just about any film as well. The acting is all outstanding, especially three scene stealers in particular (Waltz, DiCaprio and Jackson), and the pacing (of the 165 minute movie) is exhilarating as well (It never feels slow or too long). The film is very violent and disturbing and leaves a bitter taste long after it's over but that's to be expected from such shockingly nightmarish but true subject matter. Tarantino has said he wants to do films that deal with our horrible past (that most people are too ashamed to deal with) but depict them as stylized genre films rather than \"big issue movies\". At this he definitely succeeds.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XMIq71cWOY",

Dejango just had this aggressive feeling to it with all the action scenes and all the blood. That kind of feeling really makes me get into a movie. Dejango the main character is black so he isn't treated as well as the white people because this movie was taking place so long ago, slavery was still there. But he finds a wealthy white person who is nice to him and takes care of him you could say. I really enjoyed that within the movie.

His style of zaniness, violence, and gleeful unpredictability has delivered some of the best movies in the past 25 years. Django Unchained is most certainly a Tarantino work, so if you love his antics, then you will not be disappointed. One little difference: This film is quite mature.Yes, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill are spectacular movies, but they don't contain the subtle maturity of a Spielberg, Scorsese, or a Nolan. But with Django, it feels like a true-blue bloody Western with adult themes, superb storytelling, and fantastic performances and drama. It is all just mixed in with the special Tarantino touch. And yes, that touch includes Rick Ross blasting over the speakers during a backdrop of 1800s Mississippi.Django Unchained is about a bounty hunter that recruits a slave that knows the physical appearances of his next targets and all the adventures that follow. In the meantime the slave is on a hunt to locate his wife that was separated from him because of the slave trade. Essentially, this is like a revenge fairy tale for the folks who have had family that suffered from the harsh event in American history.Quentin Tarantino is one of the best screenwriters as well as best directors in this generation. There was a subtle worry that surrounded how he could handle a period piece without the crutches of clever pop culture and hipster dialogue. But just like Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained is a pleasure to the ears with the great one-liners and dozens of wonderful moments that could have you laughing or could have you on the edge of your seat.This film is just an overall delight in nearly every sense of the word, from the cinematography to the acting (Christoph Waltz is absolutely amazing) to the editing to the content. There are no clich\u00e9s in Tarantino's world. And yes, some of his small, small weaknesses do also pop up like when some scenes feel incomplete or when the movie as a whole drags just a bit too thin. However this film is just too much fun for those setbacks top let you down.Django Unchained is typical Tarantino, pure and simple. A little more mature, a little more subdued, but still delightfully out of control.",

Slave, Foxx, is freed of his chains, by Waltz, again turning in a great performance as a mysterious doctor. In return, he wants something- a guide. Waltz's one hell of a gunslinger, his title occupation, a front for his real activities as a bounty hunter, that's indeed profitable. This has much more violence than you would expect, as judged by Tarantino's previous showings. That's after his first Kill Bill. We charter new territory here, the slave aspect, working better than other anti slavery movies of past. Think Drum and Mandingo. Here Foxx and Waltz partner up, Foxx in a quest to find his beautiful black wife, (Kerry Washington) who's been sold to a slave plantation. Ruthless, slave owner, De caprio, playing bad, really good, takes them there, where Foxx, must steal her away from the notorious Candiland. Catchy. Samuel L Jackson, one of those truly underrated actors, is great and funny, as the bigoted butler of this house, who always sucks up to De Caprio, if reiterating his points. The Tarintino humor is back, as is lashings of violence in plenty supply, the cracking sound of those whips, making us appreciate something we'll gladly never have to endure. We too have some close up shots, when involving ailments, that almost made me want to take up beer drinking. The shootout scenes, some that catch us by surprise, are brilliantly staged, where some of you viewers may need to have some stomachs on this violent journey. The performances of nearly every actor in this film are so good, some who you first won't recognize, Don Johnson in particular, who runs one slave plantation early in the film. Some you don't recognize at all, until reading the end credits, where you'll end up saying \"Hang on, who were they?\" We're talking some veteran actors too, who haven't been on the cinema screen for yonks. Tarantino as a mining company worker dons an Aussie accent that does keep slipping, but when it doesn't, it was quite impressive, it'll catch you by surprise, some of his dialogue gets lost under his trying efforts. Sorrily, Aussie Jarratt, is the worst actor in this, openly using an Aussie accent, with his character that's made him look like a d...head in other films. As highly anticipating a piece of acting, that would blow me away, accent, too, I was clearly despondent, thinking \"What, are you kidding me\"? And of course, these accents felt truly out of place in this otherwise great film, which is a movie treat if you haven't been to the cinema for quite a while.",

            "content": "I enjoyed this movie, although I don't really know why.It is ridiculously violent, downright cheesy, corny and melodramatic, rather artificial and unrealistic, occasionally aimless, overly complicated.However, it is quite original and certainly fun to watch. Tarantino delights in showing moviegoers bold, shocking characters and images . Many of them are clich\u00e9 but at the same time they are strangely original and seductive, and not clich\u00e9 at all. Vampire aliens and Nazis have served as the villains in his past movies; now it is the turn of slave owners and traders, and their redneck yahoo workers.In the \"horrors of slavery\", Tarantino has found a juicy historical scab to pick, and he works at it for over two and a half hours. He shows us things about the South that probably never happened, but that we think must have happened. This movie made me wonder why we don't see more movies about what slavery was really like (not just in the South, but everywhere).Some of the characters are memorable and the performances truly excellent: Christoph Waltz and Samuel Jackson in particular have created astonishing, powerfully evocative characters that will be hard to forget. Glorious bastards.However, the scene with Tarantino and the men with Australian accents didn't work for me at all. It was like the movie had stopped and we were now watching a skit or rehearsal.And go see this movie if you're ready to go through the psychological experiment of seeing what happens to your understanding of the N-word after you hear it repeated 5,000 times (in 160 minutes). It's a strange thing that the Dutch film distributors chose to allow the N-word to be translated as \"neger\" in the Dutch subtitles, which is roughly the equivalent of \"negro\". For English speakers, imagine if \"negro\" had been used 5,000 times in this movie instead of \"n*gger\". No, I think the right Dutch translation would have been \"nikker\". They chose to bowdlerize the translation.",

He is excellent at creating scenes of tension, in setting up a story where we see the main players with their conflicting interests and a genuine sense of tension. He did it back in Reservoir Dogs with an undercover cop, in Inglourious Basterds with a Jew-sheltering farmer and performs the same feat again in Django Unchained. What we have right up until the big reveal is a very good movie with a varied cast of individuals each with their own motivations. Lovely. But then it looks like Tarantino cannot get out of the knot he has tied himself. Maybe because he works alone he doesn't have the option of going to other scriptwriters to help him, and maybe there is no-one in the Tarantino camp who can be honest enough with him to tell him when it's not good enough, but right at the moment that Christoph Waltz shoots Leonardo Di Caprio the whole film falls apart.It is almost as if Tarantino is saying \"I can't think of a way out of this, I can't be bothered to work at an answer so here is an implausible gore-fest shootout to close the film.\"The first half of the film is an 8, the second half is a 4.

Except Samuel Jackson's great acting, there is nothing but a total carnage in this film. One crazy lunatic comes along, spends a huge budget, uses great names, like Morricone, and all the actors, and come up with a total waste of resources. I guess this film shows the level of mess Tarantino is at his film making ability. He totally messed up the entire Django and spaghetti western related themes, ruined the memories we had about these films.I just don't know where to begin in criticizing this film. The storyline flow, meaninglessly long but nonsense dialogues, exuberantly extended gory blood scenes, and on and on. As I kept saying, Tarantino has been on a downward slope in his career since Jacky Brown, and this film is probably lower than the bottom side. I think, or, if I were in level of authority in Hollywood, I would have banned Tarantino in making any film without going thru some treatment of some kind. I am having serious problem in understanding how on earth studio execs would fund such a carnage. I guess, this would be the last time I go and watch any Tarantino movie anymore. The level of mess in the film is beyond any explanation. If any person would do what Tarantino does in his business, he probably would be taken directly into jail by the account of misusing the company resources. What Hitler has done to the world is nothing compared to what Tarantino did to the world of spaghetti western genre. It is also bewildering to see such names like Morricone putting his name to this carnage. Despite the fact that I am a huge fan of Spaghetti Westerns, I fell asleep three times during the film. Such a huge failure beyond any explanation. I hope Tarantino stops fiddling with old films, and leave us alone with our good old memories. It is almost as disrespectful as pissing on your grand father's grave. I think people like Franco Nero should have rightly gone crazy to see how his main film was exploited so badly, and people like Sergio Corbucci would have turned twice in his grave seeing this carnage.I suggest don't even waste your time in considering this film. World deserves much better films than this.",

            "content": "Tarantino seems to have been running out of ideas lately and relies on shock and gore rather than on a good script to make his movies stand out.I really disliked Inglorious Bastards as, except for two brilliant scenes (the first scene with Christopher Waltz and the dialog in the basement pub seemingly inspired by a scene from Where Eagles Dare), the movie was just juvenile, stupid and just plain disgusting occasionally. Now, Django fares a little better as there is not so much stupidity in the script (and no characters like Brad Pitt and his squad from Inglorious Bastards), but there is little worthy of mention, either.(SPOILERS ahead) The movie starts on a good foot with Waltz setting Django free to help him identify three former slave farm supervisors. Now, for a western revenge movie, hunting these three guys to pay for what they have done to him and his wife would have been the central plot of this movie. Django would have time to slowly develop his relationship with his German \"owner\" from distrust to even some kind of friendship (not to mention his weapon skills). Instead, they instantly become friends and Django, seemingly a born gunslinger, kills those three guys on the first farm they visit. The movie drags on unnecessarily after that only to finally switch to a search for Django's wife (who is alive and mostly well, as it turns out, thus nullifying any potential revenge factor). She is located on DiCaprio's farm where Django performs his fake slave-owner character unexpectedly (and illogically) well, but surprisingly, the experienced German head-hunter, who otherwise kills people without a second thought with a mathematically cold logic, somehow fails to hide his shock and disgust of a few (admittedly gruesome) slave deaths. I was at least hoping that it would turn out that he was playing some double game and that he will turn on Django, but that was just wishful thinking. Surprisingly, the cool German fails to keep his cool once more and shoots DiCaprio's character, gets killed and with him what little coherence was there in the movie. After an unnecessarily long and blood bursting firefight, Django is taken alive (why?), but instead of being tortured (why?), he is sold to some miners to face a fate worse than any gruesome death itself (supposedly, as all we have are words by Jackson's character). But, somehow he convinces the miner's men or whoever they were as the movie doesn't bother to explain (nor did I care by that point) to let him go (wtf?) and even give him a gun (WTF?); then he spares no thought in killing them for some reason (why?) and runs back to the farm where previously dozens of armed men were holding guard, but for some reason none remain. He shoots the totally unused James Remar character, plus the unused lawyer and Candy's sister characters while releasing the unnecessary Candy's mistress character. Also, underused Samuel L. Jackson's character is shot (didn't really find him mean or anything, but more like a semi-stupid old fool). Django then shows that he's handy with dynamite, too, and leaves the farm with a cartoon-like explosion in the background (Candy must have been holding a dynamite storage there) and rides into the sunset with his rather bland and unconvincing wife character. The end. Notice how there's so many times I mention the words \"for some reason\" and \"unused\", as somehow the movie of some two and a half hours fails to find any space for development of most of its characters or to cater us with some logic behind its characters' actions.I ended up liking some of the music used and DiCaprio's character - not that it was a memorable character, but DiCaprio did a great job with a lousy script at hand. Waltz was OK, but kind of predictable as his character is rather similar to the character in Inglorious Bastards in his overdone slow and meticulous explanations, but ridden of any menace and thus, any powerful impact. Jackson was good, but his character was criminally limited by the script. Disappointing and very unnecessary. Oh, sounds like my review! Wait..",

            "content": "When Warhol said that in the future everyone would be famous for fifteen minutes, he was almost dead-on. Watch yourself a TED talk and see, Warhol was such a damned genius that he was only 5 minutes off. But he didn't only mean that fame would become an industry and everyday people would achieve it, if for only a little while. He meant there would be different degrees of fame, all for sale, and the lowest form would be 15 minutes of unjustified stardom. He meant that it would be arbitrary.That's what Quentin Tarantino's fame is; totally arbitrary. He isn't proof that filmmaking geniuses can be found in video stores, he's proof that filmmaking geniuses aren't necessary, and they're too hard to find. It's easier, in these times, to take some hack from a video store and make him into a filmmaking genius, which is what the studios did with this moron. Quentin Tarantino is the boy-band of the movie industry. Kevin Smith was the same thing, but he's been accepted as a hack by now. Quentin rages on. He's a genius, they say. They give him Academy awards for movies that hardly make sense, like this stinker.This movie, the darling of America, is a total mess. The plot holes are so big they're canyons, and the dialogue is just tired. All the way back to Reservoir Dogs, the dialogue in Tarantino movies all sounds like Quentin sitting around talking to himself and thinking, \"Oh my God, that's a cool thing to say.\" And that's the crux of this entire film. Quentin Tarantino wants so badly to be cool, as opposed to being the quintessential geek, that he's totally flipped out and dragged his envy of black skin into the equation. He's one step from being the reverse Michael Jackson and dyeing his skin black. He's an ugly white dude and he thinks black men look cool. He's not alone in that, he's alone in his obsession. This isn't a western, it's a bunch of fantasies of Quentin's. He's fantasizing about being a slave, which, I guess, is his way of justifying his envy and his insanity regarding black people. He's going to identify with the entire race with a movie, and forever after he will be accepted as an honorary black man, or something similarly crazy. Ultimately, though, how could Quentin Tarantino be an ugly white geek if he's black? He can't, so he must be cool. I don't know. It's hard to guess the logic of a moron.His movies have always been a hodgepodge of scenes he thinks are cool, but in this one he didn't even connect them. Actually, I think he's incapable of connecting them. He's not capable of making a decent movie by himself. Luckily, studio people are smarter than he is, and they get him the help he needs, even when it's help writing the films he supposedly writes, and directing them too. Since Reservoir Dogs, other people have been making critical decisions for Quentin, and his movies have been serious studio investments managed by intelligent people. The reason the movies got worse and worse since Pulp Fiction is simple: Quentin has gotten more and more demanding, because he believes his own hype. The studios can't impose enough influence over his movies now to make them any good, but people seem to love them so the studios just go along. I just can't wait until people come out from under the Tarantino spell. I know they give him awards, I know everybody expects you to like his movies. And that's just one constant in the human condition, I guess. People always shower hacks with affection and hail them as genius while they're alive. Then, generations after forget the hacks and discover some talent from the same period, some poor bastard who went completely unrecognized and died penniless, who revolutionized the very nature of his class of art. It's a shame, because I'd like to see what really talented people are doing with cameras these days, but I'm stuck watching crap like Django because the entire world around me is hypnotized by the fame and genius of a video store clerk.",

It is a Sphagetti western film based in 1850's but it seemed so flawed that I was not so sure, if there were such cool goggles, guns and was the ride so easy to Mississippi. Yes Tarantino took liberties in showing everything from style to substance is what mislead the whole film. Maybe my problem is I expected too much out this, just trusting the ability and the genius of Tarantino. But he has disappointed me this time. And worse is it is overlong and is nearly 3 hours. Hey, Quentin what got into you man, you made a satire of a Sphagetti and not a tribute.Yes, I sincerely think this is more of a satire than a tribute. Look at the way the whole plan is chalked out, the way the music plays in background. King Schultz played by Christoph Waltz is the one to whom this whole film belongs to. Once he is dead, it was just an extension to make Django the hero in the latter half hour and that was not what I wanted. For me, Django is one in many, he would better be that. He is never shown to have a brain of his own, coz he is lead and dictated by Schultz for most time. Once Schultz is no more, he takes the mantel onto himself and destroys the whole of it. Wow, what does that mean now, for me it meant nothing much. Is such bloodshed, such a journey all for a wife, who could have been given may be by the wisdom of Schultz who was shown to have a wisdom of a very high altitude. The look, the style, the cinematography were well in place, but the heart was clearly missing. It's neither soulful nor so dead that there is no life in it. It's very much alive just that it's not so interesting as other movies from the same creator and that'w what my whole crib is about. Mundane is rather be a harsh word to say for such a western film, but its surely simplified story with eccentric characters and dialogues. Django by Jamie Foxx, is one of the weakest characters in the film and yet surprisingly the whole film is about him. Samuel Jackson as Stephen is a complete surprise package from looks to dialogues. Leanardo Dicaprio as Calvin Candie, the villain of the film is cunning just as needed to the script. Yet, Leanardo was not yet unleashed to the full potential as he should have been. Now, Chirstoph Waltz as Shultz makes the film his own, by displaying an array of cold bloodedness and makes the film his own. Despite, the presence of the other actors, Waltz shines and wow, I just loved him in this. Editing could have been taken care very well. Seriously, at least one hour could have been curtailed down. Taranatino, you mislead me this time and for next time, please make a much better one place. A 2/5 for an good film made as an average flick by one of the master directors alive.",

Eighteen years on he brings us yet another spectacle, this time on a bigger budget, bigger scale and bigger story.With it's assembled cast of brilliance the film has already grabbed a few Golden Globes and is a treat for all of the Tarantino fans out there. With Django Unchained Quentin Tarantino once again showcases his directorial and writing skills covering an unusual genre for even himself; Slavery and Western. The films's beginning title sequence sets the film up straight up with style and the sequence is supreme and as good as that of Inglorious Basterds (which is amazing.) The cinematography, the camera angles and music score to the opening of the film is all near perfection.The soundtrack to the film is glorious and fits right in the usual Tarantino standards, with the larger than life music and moments giving it the Tarantino-esque feel. A noteworthy mention is also the cinematography of the film adding strength with the excessive use of long establishing shots of the landscapes giving off the feel that this is indeed Spaghetti Western.The script and dialogue to the film is expert and is set in stone to be very memorable. 'I like the way you die boy' - for example. The film is very informative of the Slavery side too, in language, reactions and story. The cast of the film is spectacular with Jamie Foxx giving a strong performance throughout. Christopher Waltz is captivating in his role that is almost written directly for him and is as good as his other multilingual Tarantino role of Col. Hans Landa (in Inglorious Basterds.)Not appearing until late in the film, villainous Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Calvin Candi, the bad guy plantation owner and he is a stun, and engaged in the role and good to see him a another memorable role which we haven't seen from him for a since probably Inception. The absolute highlight of the performances is easily that of Samuel L. Jackson's, in which plays a delusional bad-ass old house keeper and with the accent, dialogue and bad motherfucking attitude he steals all of the motherfucking scenes he is present in.At one point of the film unfortunately, around the time of the that Tarantino makes his cameo appearance (with an awful Australian accent) you suddenly realize that the film is dragging and look at your watch to release that this is a three-hour film! only four minutes behind The Hobbit. (Which dragged like hell!).Violence? check. Witty Dialogue? check. Kick-Ass soundtrack? check - everything a Tarantino fan would want from the movie.

            "content": "Let me start this review by saying that I am quite a fan of writer and director Quentin Tarantino. I love some of his and like almost all of his works. \"Django Unchained\" was his latest movie so far and it came out 3 years ago. Apparently he had so much fun making it that he made another western movie right afterward, which is going to come out later this year. We'll see if this one is a bit into political conflicts such as slavery as well. His film before this one here dealt with Nazi Germany, so he seems to have a tendency right now to make political films. Still, they are as outrageously over-the-top and fun to watch as his older movies. I enjoyed watching Django, but not as much as \"Inglourious Basterds\", the movie he made before that. I wish he could have won the Screenplay Academy Award for that one, even if his Django script is not weak at all either. The second Oscar for this film went to Christoph Waltz for portraying Django's loyal friend and mentor Dr. King Schultz. I thought Waltz gave a good performance here and there is some irony to it that his biggest rival for Oscar glory was probably Tommy Lee Jones (who was actually supporting in contrast to Waltz), who played a White man in another slavery-centered drama as well. Still I believe, Waltz was superior in his first Tarantino film, for which he also won an Oscar.\"Django Unchained\" really is an actors movie. Waltz was good. Leonardo DiCaprio was a lot of fun to watch as well in a pretty uncommon role for him, but my absolute favorite performance here came from Samuel L. Jackson, who was amazing as the whitest Black man you could ever imagine. Excellent performance. Now, Jamie Foxx' Django wasn't bad either, but I preferred other performances here I must say. Not sure if it was the way the character was written or the way Foxx played him, but he was not the one who carried this film, even if he was the title character. Oh yeah and Tarantino himself has a fun little role as well near the end and he goes out like a boss. In general, this film can be divided into 3 parts. The first would be the way Django and Schultz meet and work together while becoming friends. The second would be the action at Candyland. And the last part would be everything that follows the deaths of two main characters. My favorite part was certainly the middle. Parts one and three were okay, but this middle part is where the movie is really great. Waltz, DiCaprio (the skull scene was outstanding) and Jackson get the best out of each other. Of course, Tarantino movies are always pretty graphic and violent, so you know what to expect when he makes a western movie, although I must say apart from the shootout scenes and near the end it was not that heavy. All in all, this was a pretty good watch for its entirety of over 150 minutes and I recommend it.",

I remember some uproar it caused when it was first released - some composers and actors refused to work with Quentin Tarantino ever again. Many people were upset about the violence and how slavery was depicted. Tarantino has stated himself that he later re-edited some scenes to tone down the violence. My personal opinion is that he made the right choice. Not that I can't stomach the violence (on the screen), but on some occasions the horrors we can't see can have a bigger impact. The scene with the runaway slave and dogs - when we hear the screams of the victim from the background while we see into the cruel eyes of Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie - it is haunting. As it is a Tarantino movie, one can expect over two hours long well-paced epic with magnificent dialogue and scene-setting. The acting is perfect with many actors doing some of their best jobs here. The balance between some of the quiet performances and that perfect little notch of over-the-top is just fantastic.'Django Unchained' is filmmaking done right - pure stylish genre movie with social commentary. And with that 'Django Unchained' might be the most important film about slavery in recent decades (yeah, take that '12 Years of Slave').",

            "content": "This is a sloppy movie. Maybe the sloppiest I've seen all year. It beat out TDKR and Alien: The Beginning. Let me start by saying I think Tarantino is a very talented director. It doesn't always show in his movies, but he's very good. I'm tired of his movies that are always too long, and uneven. While this movie is long I didn't feel it and I didn't get that sense of him just having characters talk just to talk so he can hear the dialogue he wrote for himself. Basically QT is a kid who uses actors to reenact his favorite scenes from other movies he loves. I do believe he redeemed himself a little , because I was getting sick of him and his indulgences. I think he gets too much credit for doing stuff other actors get hanged, poor choice of words, for. I think Edgar Wright is a much better director and will soon pass him and hopefully get more credit. Now that said I'm going to try my hardest to make more sense then this movies tone.First off let me start off with the bad. This movie is all over the place. I though Inglorious Basterds was crazy , but this takes the cake. I actually have to give that movie more credit, because it felt like it was working towards something and everything fit in a crazy sort of way. You're going to here this a lot. This movie has 3 different parts and everyone who reviews will say what I'm saying verbatim. The First hour is a buddy cop western, The second hour is a tension filled game of deception, the last hour is the action. The problem is that the transition is not smooth at all, there's no balance or real order and you will know what I'm talking about if you go see it. Think back to Kill Bill and how different the two volumes where. Now Imagine if it was in one movie. The pacing is slow, but for Tarantino it's a step in the right direction. Really the movie can't make up it's mind and it damages the film a significant degree. From the trailer I thought Jamie would be one note, but he turns in a solid performance. Kerry Washington has the worst performance I've seen in a Tarantino film. She is so underused and has absolutely no character. No wait. There was a worse performance. Tarantino has a cameo and it has to be the worst performance of a director in his own movie I've ever seen. He should be ashamed of himself.Next I'm going to touch on the issue of race and the use of the n-word. I'm black and I'm pretty lenient on the n word. I say it my friends say it, some of my white friends say it. I don't care it's just a word. If this was any other director I wouldn't have minded, but it's by a guy who constantly pushes the boundaries of good taste and not in a good way. I understand that it is in a time where the word was probably used a lot, but the way the movies uses it is a little gratuitous at times. I feel like Tarantino tried to fit it in when he could as opposed to using it occasional to shock people. Next is Samuel Jackson's character is extremely coonish . Once again it's hard to fully criticize, because he's playing a clich\u00e9 house negro, but even then he's such a cartoon it's hard to accept. Basically like most Tarantino's recent films, it's all about if you love Tarantino or are tired of him. Me being Tired surprisingly was mildly annoyed, but as his performance went on he was given some depth. I'd be okay with all this if this was a serious movie about slavery with Western elements. But really it's a goofy western with moments of seriousness that doesn't fit. Tarantino wants to deal with slavery, but it's so cartoonish when he does the only message you can take away was \"Slavery was bad\" Good Job Quentin definitely a revelation.Now the good. Wow the action in this movie blew me away. It's incredible and it makes me wish there was more of it. The Gore was refreshing from movies where it looked to bright or was CGI. This was all practical and it gave the action scenes a real sense of beauty and coordination. There's no doubt someone got shot because they'll be a huge splash of blood that highlights the trail of the bullets. Next performances all pretty much top notch . Leo is amazing , Sammy is good, Waltz is good. I love westerns and this one is a good one.Unfortunately I have to give this movie a 7 or a Matin\u00e9e. It felt like Tarantino was sleep walking through this one. Too much light comedy where it doesn't belong and too much deep ugliness that doesn't fit. I did feel more positive then negative even though the movie needed more scenes of tension and action. I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt and I even debated sneaking back in the theatre to watch it again. Any 2 plus hour movie that makes me want to not only sit without breaks, and rewatch right after is either called Fight Club or GoodFellas. Definitely a must see, but not one that you need to rush out and see.",

            "content": "When I was one of the lucky souls to read the lengthy, powerful script of Quentin Tarantino's eighth film, \"Django Unchained\", I came away from it with the query: \"Why the **** this script wasn't produced earlier?\" Maybe the notion of an African slave-cum-bounty hunter, pre-Civil War, was controversial. Alas, I waited, and I'm glad I did. Damn glad.The year's 1858, and slavery's thriving in America like a virus. However, eccentric German dentist/manhunter King Schultz (delightful Oscar winner Christoph Waltz from Tarantino's previous work \"Inglorious Basterds\") decides to break the status quo by liberating African slave (grim but smooth Jamie Foxx of \"Ray\") during a transport. Django helps Schultz on pointing out a trio of wanted siblings and, in return, Schultz trains Django in the manhunting trade while assisting in the liberation of his wife, the German-literate Broomhilda Von Shaft (cherub-like Kerry Washington, also of \"Ray\" and lead in the political TV drama, \"Scandal\") from the clutches of lecherous and decadent plantation owner Calvin Candie (ambitiously vile Leonardo DiCaprio of \"The Departed\" and \"Titanic\"). However, Candie's vet \"house negro\" Stephen (Tarantino chum and Oscar nominee Samuel L. Jackson in ogrish-like makeup) gets wise to the heroic duo's mandigo-purchasing scam and, like in any Tarantino opus, hell and a half breaks loose.But unlike his previous seven, Mr. Tarantino, who appears here as an Australian miner, who meets a literally explosive demise, approaches the hot-potato topic of African enslavement in the antebellum Southern United States with remarkable honesty. Flogging, iron restrains, face clamps and the maiming of runaway slaves by dogs are present; lynching is only hinted. Sure, with his exploitative fanboy rep, Tarantino (\"Pulp Fiction, \"Kill Bill\") would be the last filmmaker to approach the subject in a perfect world. However, it's not a perfect world, and those who have green eyes (cough Spike Lee cough) towards the madcap auteur should have struck the iron while it was hot. Tarantino got quick on the draw, orchestrating a porno film where Mel Brooks's \"Blazing Saddles\" is the slut; the Westerns of Sam Peckinpah are the studs; the aura is by Sergio Leone and the script is by \"Roots\" author Alex Haley. At the end, Tarantino has out-done and out-foxed his cinematic ass with pride and a bag of dynamite (HINT! HINT!). He's assisted by a brave cast. Oscar winner Foxx makes you forget his salad days on the sketch show \"In Living Color\" as the valiant, serious title hero as Oscar nominee DiCaprio finally buries his \"cute-boy\" rep as the debonair but volatile and misogynistic owner of \"Candieland\". Some have said Ms. Washington should have been given more to do, but she's sweetness incarnate; her appearance haunts Django before their reunion like a ghost. Waltz's Schultz is clever and sadly ironic; he's unaware that his descendants will take part in committing genocide in the following century as he's being noble. As for Mr. Jackson, his grotesque role, the polar opposite to his hit-man Jules in \"Fiction\" embodies the Orwellian idiom: \"Freedom Is Slavery\", to disgusting levels. It's hard to pick a favorite among the main quintet.There's also stunt-casting, a Tarantino trademark: Bruce Dern (\"Silent Running\") and Don Johnson (\"Miami Vice\", \"Nash Bridges\") are nasty plantation owners; Tom Wopat (\"The Dukes Of Hazzard\") and Lee Horsley (\"Matt Houston\") are dutiful lawmen; Dennis Christopher (\"Breaking Away\") is Candie's lawyer; James Remar (\"The Warriors\", \"Dexter\") has a dual role as a slave transporter and Candie's shotgun-toting bodyguard; Michael Parks (\"Grindhouse\", \"Red State\") is one of Tarantino's fellow miners and Walton Goggins (\"Justified\"), makeup wizard Tom Savini (the original \"Friday The 13th\") and Tarantino stunt gal Zoe Bell are among Candie's grungy henchmen. Jonah Hill (\"Moneyball\", \"Superbad\") has a fun bit as a dim-wit Klansman (is there any other kind?).There's also Tarantino's respect to film's past: Spaghetti Western icon Franco Nero, star of the original Django film from 1966, shows up as Candie's fellow fan of mandigo fighting. The film's co-distributor, Columbia Pictures, resurrects one of their vintage \"Torch Lady\" stamps before the film plays the \"Django's Song\" composed by Luis Bacalov. Tarantino has more funky tunes from his catalog, including Richie Havens's \"Freedom\", which is used ironically in a devastating scene.D.P. Robert Richardson captures the beauty and ugliness as pre-Civil War America with John Ford-like landscape shots and quick close-ups that come from a 70s kung-fu film. The late production designer J. Michael Riva make the antebellum South authentic (Was that statue of two mandigo fighters in combat made or found?!). There's been criticism of the film's running time (2 hours and 45 minutes) since Tarantino's longtime editor, Sally Menke, passed away, but her substitute, Fred Raskin (the last three \"Fast & Furious\" films) understands that the tale's messy and compliments it.Next to Zack Snyder's \"Watchmen\" (specifically the 215 minute cut), \"Django Unchained\" is a violent film that's socially and historically conscious (not historically accurate, mind you. It's not a somber epic!!!). Despite having two more films on his plate before voluntary retirement, Mr. Tarantino probably feels like Robert Redford at the end of \"The Candidate\". \"Since this film's a masterstroke, what the hell am I going to do now?\" he ponders. I could also imagine him secretly showing the film to the forty-fourth President of the United States...",

            "content": "Personally what separates this movie from other western/revenge/race pieces, Tarantino or otherwise, is the cast. In this case you can't imagine Django as anyone but Jamie Fox, Dr. King Schultz as anyone other than Christoph Waltz etc. The only performance in this that I will not take with me until I die is Kerry Washington as through a lack of lines and not being stellar like the other 5 main characters. Speaking of which, I think this might be my favourite Leonardo DiCaprio role yet. He's incredible in The Revenant etc, but the level of depth he brings to Calvin Candie through less than an hour of screen time in tantalising and an insatiable watch.\nIf you think of a badass movie it's this. It has everything. Firstly, a killer plot about revenge and ultimately love. Secondly, the best use of blood in any movie I've seen, somehow using it both comically and to hammer the point in at the same time.\nTarantino films are special. From what I can tell, ever since reservoir dogs was released so many films have tried to do their best to be a Tarantino film, but so far none have the quippy dialogue and balls-to-the-Wall flare of him. Django is no different. In many ways it feels the same way as untouchables, taking this extremely volatile topic, of 1800's slave trade and racism, and making it a genuine delight to watch and one of the funniest Tarantino films.\nThere are a plethora of points I'd like answers to but will never get them, which will in turn keep this in my mind. These just add to the Tarantino magic, just like the briefcase in pulp fiction.\nDo I think it's his best? No way. Pulp Fiction is better than this by a long shot in my opinion, and his final movie is going to have to be a masterpiece to beat it, but do I think it's 2nd? Probably, it's either that or reservoir dogs to me.",

            "content": "As I waited for this film to come out I wasn't really sure what to expect, but then again it is difficult to actually know what to expect when it comes to a Tarrantino film (with the exception of gratuitous violence that has the effect of making you burst out in laughter, well not really in all his films, but in some of them at least). This is probably what I like about Tarrantino is that you really do not know what to expect, except for a film that has been crafted by an artistic master. Okay, not all of his films are like that, but then he is also one that loves to experiment as well.Ignoring the plot (and yes, there is a plot) this film is about slavery, though it is not one that says that slavery is bad, but one that tries to explore the culture of slavery in the Southern States and to give us an idea of what it was like not just to be a slave, but to also be a Negro, during that period. For instance, there was a law that a Negro was not allowed to ride a horse, and this is emphasised a number of times where Django appears on horseback and his traveling companion is rebuked by others for allowing such a thing to occur.We also see how the culture was divided into the house slaves, namely those that worked inside and tended to have a less harsh life, and the field slaves, namely those that worked out in the field. It was more complicated than that as well, because the rebellious slaves, when they weren't killed, were sent to work in the mines, which was a literal death sentence. Further (and we see this because Django has the mark clearly on his cheek) if a slave attempted to run away then he would be marked with an 'r' on his cheek, which indicated that he was a runner.As is expected with most Tarrantino films, it is not non-stop action, and it is never meant to be. The film is all about developing the character, and we see this especially with Django, who goes from being a subdued slave, almost scared to even raise his dead, to the master of his own destiny. Even though you could say that the film ends 'happily ever after' we do know that this is not the case. Django, even though he has been reunited with his wife (negros were not allowed to marry) is still trapped in the middle of the South with no protector to look after him.",

I happen to be a fan of both movies and film, so I am able to appreciate movies that have been made just to entertain an audience rather than just those that contain a message that the viewer should learn. \"Django Unchained\", by the above description, is an incredibly well-made movie.The acting is top notch and the writing contains all of Tarantino's trademarks that we have loved since \"Reservoir Dogs\" introduced audiences to this unique talent back in 1992. Yes, the violence has been magnified to ludicrous and even comedic heights, but that only serves to remove the viewer from the more horrific atrocities depicted on screen. I happen to feel that this movie ranks in the lower half of QT's filmography, but that in no way means that I think it is a bad film. No, I still love it. It's also a little long, having been the first film he made since the passing of his longtime editor, and it could be shortened to quicken the pacing a little bit. But I'll be damned if I can think of any scenes in it that could or should have been cut from its heavy 165-minute runtime.Having read a great deal of the other reviews of this movie on IMDb, I felt compelled to add my own, because there is a common thread that unites all of the one-star reviews.

For example, Christopher Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio talk on the dinner table for literally an hour before anything happens. The pace of the ending ten minutes is very very quick, and if the previous 2.5 hours were that quick the film would have been shortened by at least 1.5 hours. It's a Quentin Tarantino film, so you know there has to be a lot of blood to the point of being almost comical, and that almost everybody dies in the end.

            "review_title": "Not the great film it could have been",
            "content": "You would be forgiven that, during a screening of Quentin Tarantino's latest Django Unchained, that one of the many directors the film plays homage to, is John Ford. After all, Ford all but made the American western genre his own, from early silents such as The Iron Horse (1924), to well-established classics like My Darling Clementine (1946) and The Searchers (1956), he brought critical adoration to a genre that was then seen as nothing more than popcorn cinema. But Tarantino hates John Ford, to quote - \"to say the least, I hate him [...] It really is people like that that kept alive this idea of Anglo-Saxon humanity compared to everybody else's humanity.\" So, in Django, do we have a post-modern, anti-Ford American West, where a freed black slave is the hero, and the White Man the devil? Well, kinda. But this is Tarantino, and from what was clear from his previous film Inglourious Basterds (2009), he doesn't do things the regular way.Very much like Inglourious Basterds, the most intriguing thing I found with Django is its sheer unpredictability. The later work of Tarantino have elected to follow very much they're own path, ignoring narrative convention or story-telling tradition in favour of certain scenes or ideas that the director wants there, or focusing on a certain character when they really have no purpose being there. For example, August Diehl's Major Hellstrom appears from nowhere in possibly the finest scene from Inglorious Basterds. He has no other scenes, but his character is instantly intriguing, whereas such a scene and character wouldn't have been given neither the depth or the screen-time if done by somebody else. It is a basic cover-gets-blown scene, seen in a thousand other films, but in Basterds it becomes a masterwork of tension, and features some of Tarantino's best ever dialogue. You could call it indulgent, but Tarantino sees the opportunity to squeeze as much as he can from every possible moment.Django follows the same idea, but whereas this approach complimented Basterds' chapter-based structure and plethora of supporting characters and extended cameos, Django has neither the wealth of central characters, nor the sheer scope to be a complete success, or to justify it's massive 165-minute running-time. The narrative hook of Django finding his wife is given very little screen-time or focus that by the time this becomes important, its very difficult to really care. The more intriguing relationship that comes out of the film is in fact the one between Django and Schultz - polar opposites in terms of societal position and background - yet both in a situation that calls for them needing each other. The main bulk of the first two-thirds follows the two in the tradition of a buddy-movie, only they get along, and Tarantino manages to eject some fine comic moments into these scenes, as well some actually quite touching ones.Although he doesn't possess the sociopathic charisma as his Hans Landa from Basterds did, the character of Schultz is another triumph for Tarantino and Waltz both, the latter being recognised again by the Academy and receiving a Best Supporting Actor nod. Like Landa, Schultz is a social intellectual, a man able to use his wits and charm to lure his victims into a false sense of security before either blowing the top of their head off, or outwitting a town's marshal. But it is Waltz - and DiCaprio's maniacal plantation owner - that comes out of this most memorable, not the film's protagonist, Django. Foxx is perfectly fine in the role, as angry and posturing as you would want (\"you gonna let me pick my own wardrobe?\"), but sadly just as un-memorable. Tarantino seems so wrapped up in Schultz and the film's extreme violence that Django gets left out in the rain, lacking the iconic costume or the stand-out scene that, say, Uma Thurman's The Bride in Kill Bill (2003-2004) had.Spike Lee has said he will be boycotting the film, claiming the slave trade is not a subject for exploiting or trivialising, and opposes the excessive use of the 'n' word (something he complained about in Jackie Brown (1997) - a film that celebrated one of the most important era's for Black Cinema). It's a shame he will never see the film, as he would realise that not only does Tarantino take the matter seriously, but is the most brutal and explicit depiction of it I've ever seen. The violence is often over-the-top and cartoonish, yes, but is also disturbing and genuinely horrific (the Mandingo fight and dog scene being particular memorable). Tarantino also mocks the KKK (or an early version of it) in a scene which is in direct reference to John Ford playing one of the charging KKK in The Birth of a Nation (1915). Before the charge, they argue about the badly made eye-holes in their masks. It's a light scene given their intention, but goes on far too long to remain funny.As much as I dislike Tarantino (as a person), his films will always be irresistibly intriguing. Regardless of whether they're self-indulgent missteps such as Death Proof (2007), or strokes of genius like Inglourious Basterds, you will always be getting something profoundly different to anything that any other director is even contemplating. Django is no different, setting out on one path and ending up wandering several detours, like a fat kid happily chasing the scent of gingerbread. When we do get to the end, it suffers from a serious anti- climax - disappointing given the 150-minute build-up. This is not the great film it really could have been, due to the neglect of its lead, a lack of real focus, and a final half hour that seems to strive for super-cool moments of iconography, rather than giving the film the satisfying ending that it really deserves. Ennio Morricone's title song is amazing, however.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

But even with my pro-Tarantino bias, I only found a handful of scenes and characters the least bit interesting.The main problem with it is the cheap humor and reliance on vengeance to have the viewer connect with the story. It's some new (unfortunate) genre of slapstick-ultra-violence. The laughs are awkwardly placed into a mostly serious and action-packed narrative (and I use the description \"laughs\" loosely). Combining laughable moments in a serious scene, even a bloody scene, is one of Tarantino's strengths ( think \"Oh man, I just shot Marvin in the face.\" -Pulp Fiction), but the attempts at humor in Django are childish and silly (a clansman going home because no one values his wife's KKK masks, wt-f?). They border on Wayans Brothers' type humor (not a compliment).My second point: The reliance on vengeance to keep the audience interested is, unfortunately, the foundation of this film. It's almost as if a group of frat boys got together and brainstormed on how to stick it to racism. \"How about the racist dudes get shot in the balls?!\" \"Yeah! F*#k racism!\" And, again, this is territory that Tarantino has covered brilliantly before (anti-Nazi sentiment throughout Inglorious Basterds) so he should be able to pull it off. But unlike Eli Roth smashing in the skull of an SS officer with a bat, Django's bloody scenes are pointless Van Damme-style shootouts that appeal to only the most base emotions.Maybe the difference in the successful examples from previous movies and those of Django are the two-dimensional nature of the main characters in this movie. Django, doesn't change very much from the beginning of the film to the end. And I don't just mean emotionally...for some reason, he's already a pretty good shot when he first picks up a gun? Django's character is more about the surface-level bad@*# imagery than, say, Vincet Vega, who is a bad@*#, but who is capable of emotions and character development within his role as a bad@*#. Django is just a cardboard cutout of a character with black sunglasses and a six-shooter.I guess I should mention the good parts of the movie too: Samuel L. Jackson's performance is great. His character has some of those attempts at cheap laughs, but the quality of his acting and the believability of the character make you forget about the cheesy moments. I also thought the scene where Dr. Schultz lets Django choose his own outfit was honest and believable, not to mention one of the more clever moments.I know I'm in the minority, but I was greatly disappointed and would not recommend seeing it in theaters.",

Dr. Shultz makes a king move in helping Django reunite with his wife; his plan is to go to Candieland and for him and Django to pretend to be Mandingo aficionados in order to scheme a method to buy off Broomhilda from Calvin Candie. Of course, there is always plenty of grotesque violence, boisterous mayhem, and witty dialogue in a Tarantino flick and fortunately that is also in the menu of this spaghetti western Quentin has delighted us with; his films are in a genre of their own. Quentin is worthy of screenplay & director Oscar nominations for his ingenious \"off the chain\" orchestration and scribe of \"Django Unchained\". Foxx was one cool black cat as Django. Christoph Waltz' performance as Dr. King Schultz was just as juicy as his Oscar-winning work in Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\", but with a heroic quality to it. Leonardo DiCaprio's first premier villainous role in his performance as Calvin Candie proves that Leo is just as good playing bad as he is playing good. Tarantino favorite Samuel L. Jackson served up a meaty performance as Candie's main butler Stephen, who was just as villainous maybe even more than Candie himself; and he is black. Don Johnson delivered a vice mac-daddy cameo performance playing the negro-hating plantation owner Big Daddy. And even though she was a bit underutilized, Kerry Washington swept it up nicely thespian style as Broomhilda. \"Django Unchained\" was a chain of exemplary film-making and acting that deserves a chain reaction of praise. ***** Excellent",

Using non PC language, showing graphic violence and so forth. Truly makes this film more of an experience than a viewing.

Takes much too long to get where it's going, and has a third act that runs on violent overdrive, but like most of the director's previous efforts it's memorable and well-acted. Foxx is well-cast as the titular character, Waltz matches him as the secondary one, and DiCaprio has an especially meaty role as the vile antagonist, but no one shines more than Jackson who creates one of his most memorable characters to date.

While Tarantino's talent is still clearly visible, he seems to have gotten too famous, and too arrogant for his own good. It seem like there really isn't anyone in his entourage (anymore?) that tells him he's going too far.Both Django and his previous film Inglourious Basterds are supposedly \"revenge fantasies\". Bad periods in history revisited in such way that this time the 'good guys' win. In Inglorious Basterds World War II is being revisited into an entirely different outcome (didn't we already win in the original? Yes, but this time it's even quicker, and more graphic!). And in Django Unchained the slave goes after the owner.It's like the fantasies of a 12yr old, where the little kid beats up the bully for a change. It's nice to dream about (when you're 12), but way too simplistic for an actual movie. Predictable and aiming for a quick burst of satisfaction. It's like cooking a three star dinner, and making it liquid for easy digestion.And to make manners worse, it's soooo looong! Pretentiously slow, unnecessary spread out and completely over the top. Which can be good (Grindhouse was over the top great), but here the film is simply taking itself way too serious. It's arrogantly staring the audience in the face, grinning: \"I'm made by Tarantino, suck on me!\"Maybe his stature has become his problem. Remaking a B-film into a big movie only works with the lightheartedness of the B-film industry. it won't work with giant expectations and supersized egos like Tarantino's anymore.

Then the body count gradually increases every 20 minutes till this almost 3 hour serious version of Blazing Saddles comes to an end. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy watching it - viewed it a second time as a matter of fact - but felt that Tarantino could have done better with a more viable screenplay and organised direction. There seems to be a lot of disjointed moments that need further elucidation - more than coincidental that the very first plantation visited happened to harbour the fugitives from justice that the main characters were seeking for. Christoph Waltz turns in a memorable performance as Dr King Schultz, German expatriate ex-dentist who speaks impeccable Oxford Dictionary style English, who has turned to bounty hunting as a calling, evidently seeing more profit in removing whole (bad) bodies than just bad teeth. He is supposed to be the good guy, but at times comes through as a self-righteous stuck-up pompous a-- who justifies his actions with pieces of legal documents (warrants) authorizing him to take down outlaws, dead or alive (preferably the former). Jamie Foxx as the eponymous character seems rather stiff and hesitant in the beginning, as if thinking what to do or say next, and only gradually comes out of his shell, as it were, much later in the film, when he's dressed ostentatiously in blue boy costume and astride a noble steed and gets to do a lot of shooting and talking. Leonardo DiCaprio is the delightfully despicable plantation owner Calvin Candie, who enjoys slave fights and black wenches, with a dialogue of high vocabulary to match Schultz's. Other characters do little more than just stand aside as living set decorations. Samuel L Jackson as Stephen is in my opinion the most unforgettable and noteworthy character in the film; he seems to revel in his role as the subservient yet outspoken black mayordomo to Mr Candie (\"who dat niggah on dat nag?!\"), although coming across as comical and stereotypical Uncle Tom or Stepin Fetchit, he proves to be very perceptive and astute than given credit for - as in the scenes where he correctly deduces that Broomhilda and Django already know each other previously. A lot of the movie is taken up by needless and irrelevant scenes, like the Regulators aka Bag Men (precursors to the KKK), and Django's trip to the Dickey Quint mines in the hands of 3 inept and inefficient mine minions, in which Tarantino has a bit role speaking in a rather atrocious and laughable attempt at Aussie Strine. And to the more historically savvy, there's the numerous anachronisms and factual errors to nitpick at - dynamite, drinking straws, sunglasses and the Henry Repeater rifle, to name a few. But don't let this review put you off from seeing DU. It does have its glorious moments, blood and gore and all. But as with Tarantino films, don't expect a history lesson to base your book report on.",

This should have happened after Kill Bill, though (Part 1, for that matter, despite the fact that the author regards both parts to be one movie). I don't want to sound too negative, so let me add that I believe his best and only decent work is Jackie Brown (1997).Here it became clear to me how Quentin Tarantino wanted to make a movie in every genre he liked while working in the video rental in his early days. Just think of this sequence: Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained.Anyhow, the photography has been wonderful again, the colors warm and the actors dressed smart. Christopher Waltz has been great again, the rest of the cast less so. The script is Tarantino's ego tripping and leading nowhere while his small role proved ot be abysmal.And there we reach the same old mystery surrounding Tarantino. An army of connoisseurs tried to explain the higher plane of his output. In the case of Django Unchained, the message is supposedly anti-racist and elevated to the level of some ultimate anti-slavery pamphlet. Strange, since from his interviews I understood that Quentin Tarantino has been a movie buff and has been making movies that he himself would like to watch. I haven't been able to detect any higher meaning there...What bothers me the most are the splatter scenes that came to be his so-called signature. It is somehow expected that there will be blood being abundantly spilt and this is considered a baroque exaggeration of violence, more of a ballet or an opera and less a documentary about violence. At the same time your average horror movie is dismissed displaying the same thing.",

Not only did Quentin Tarantino (writer/director) make it believable he made it worth sitting through the 2 hour and forty-five minute running time. Initially as seen in the trailer Django (Jamie Foxx) is requisitioned by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a German dentist to assist him in his current trade, from there the adventure begins and includes the task of reuniting Django with his wife. The dialogue was filled with far too many nickels for my taste, but there were consequences for its usage which shows that there is a cost for speaking ugly words. Uncle Ruckus, I mean Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) was the character that you immediately love to hate, the portrayal was so convincing that I watched him in every scene with a measure of contempt. I have become accustomed to the signature excessive blood spatters when flesh is injured typical of a Tarantino film, but the gore and carnage in this film was a bit much even for Mr. Tarantino. I guess that pushing the envelope with the savagery is his way of being explosive. This film had shocking moments that took me to the limits of disgust like the Mandingo fights and there were moments that took me to the opposite end of the spectrum by Django's love for Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Ms. Washington is a natural beauty but her acting chops were only challenged here by anguish, I guess a man's man has a hard time thinking up what a slave woman would say so she had very little dialogue, but she did emote well. I don't know what the emotional response was that was expected from the viewing of this film, but I was left somewhere in the middle. The middle of the scale for those two extremes is indifference. The final scenes were a payoff and I especially liked the horse tricks, but I'm trying to decide if it was a big enough pay off to lean more towards favoring the story or reviling the violence. This one was difficult to gauge, it was entertaining but I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that I laughed at some of the uncanniest things like the klan. I will linger on the middle ground with an amber light.",

Django Unchained sees the director turning to the Spaghetti Western for inspiration, borrowing film-making techniques from the greats of the genre (most notably Sergios Leone and Corbucci) while adding his own trademark touches\u2014snappy banter and over-the-top violence. The result is something of a mixed bag\u2014some of it works brilliantly, much of it is unremarkable yet still entertaining, and some of it is embarrassingly bad. Fortunately, the positives outweigh the negatives, the overall result being far from Tarantino's best work, but a long way from his worst as well.The good points include a decent soundtrack (something that QT has always managed to get right), excellent performances from the film's primary cast members (Christoph Waltz putting in a particularly good turn as bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz), a decent supporting cast that includes both big name actors and cult favourites, lots of very brutal violence, and a few well executed action scenes, the film's highlight being a brilliantly choreographed and extremely gory shootout between Django and numerous soon-to-be-dead gun-toting bad guys, the equivalent of Kill Bill's blood drenched Crazy 88s fight (it's such an exhilarating scene it makes one wonder why QT didn't cut some of the jibber-jabber and devote more of the running time to action).Of the more woeful content, we get a supposedly humorous exchange between various members of a hooded raid party that is painfully unfunny, the expected cameo performance by QT (as a slave-driver) which is up to his usual low standard, far too much 'filler' (the film could have been shorter: it doesn't feel epic enough to warrant such a long running time), and a finale that, although explosive, still comes as something of a disappointment after the aforementioned shootout scene.",

Everything by Tarantino since, just awful.I have read some of the glowing reviews for this film, and come away completely puzzled - did we watch the same film? First thoughts that come to mind for this film; dull, plodding, contrived, and sometimes silly. And yet the plot could have been a foundation for a really good film.It started well, with one very witty section concerning a sheriff and marshal. Very witty, very clever. However, even in the early stages, it was apparent that Tarantino had bought a job lot of blood at a discount, and was going to throw buckets of the stuff around. It is not that I object to violence in movies. I forget the name now, but not so long ago watched an excellent film in which a person was sliced in half in a fight sequence. It worked, it fitted, and nothing but positives for the film (which makes the lapse of memory odd). In the case of Django, it was just clumsy violence for the sake of it, and don't say that I don't get it, that it is tongue in cheek etc. etc. No, it is just clumsy and pointless, and poorly done.There was one fight scene which was much, much better - the unarmed fight scene in the room was shocking (well done shocking) and it is probably no coincidence that this scene did not include the blood buckets.If Tarantino could do more scenes like this, there would be no stopping him. Instead, we mostly get the buckets.As for the acting, it is pretty variable. I have grown to respect Di Caprio, but this performance was just OK. Samuel L. Jackson was just unconvincing most of the time. Jamie Foxx did warm up a bit as the movie progressed, but the starting point for the warm up was at the bottom of the thermometer. Christoph Waltz was lonely on the screen as the only star performer and managed to convey some of the potential of the plot.In summary, action scenes; mostly distracted by comedy blood spatters. Cinematography; passable. Plot; plodding, dull, etc. Dialogue; plodding, dull etc. but with a few (very few) moments of sparkle. Acting; mostly routine. Oh, I nearly forgot. The titles were good.Judging by the reviews, I can only conclude that there are too many Tarantino groupies out there .....or maybe I am out on limb in thinking that upping the blood spatter content to buckets of blood is not 'witty' or 'cool'???? 'heh, look, other people use gallons of blood, but I am so cool....I use bath tubs of blood, and do it in an ironic and post-modern way.....etc.' For me it is just for shock 'schlock' and it is not ironic, post-modern, witty, clever, intelligent, challenging or any of the other excuses that are trotted out to excuse this kind of junk. It is just lazy and an ersatz form of 'creativity'.Still, at least Django is an improvement on Kill Bill, but that is not praise.",

The second half focuses on their attempt to infiltrate a Mississippi plantation owned by pompous Southerner \"Monsieur\" Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) in order to rescue Django's wife (Kerry Washington). Samuel L. Jackson plays Candie's overly loyal house slave.This is an excellent American Western with Spaghetti Western elements featuring Tarantino's typical artistic flourishes. It takes place in the West AND in the South, which is reminiscent of the underrated \"Nevada Smith\" (1966), one of my favorite Westerns. Waltz is magnetic as the nonchalant protagonist and he & Foxx have good chemistry. There's a nice mix of interesting dialogues, amusing moments and over-the-top action. Unfortunately, but to be expected, Tarantino goes overboard with the 'n' word and the blood-letting, the latter to the point of cartoonish-ness. Nevertheless, this is an original Western that is vibrant with creativity, including stunning locations, cinematography and a great amalgamated soundtrack/score, which includes cuts by Ennio Morricone, like the excellent \"Hornets' Nest,\" the imaginative \"The Braying Mule\" and the moving \"Ancora Qui.\" It's all-around superior to \"The Hateful Eight\" (2015) because it's not limited by a one-room whodunit plot (although \"Hateful\" has its unique points of interest).The movie runs 165 minutes and was shot in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Evergreen Plantation & New Orleans, Louisiana; and several locations in California (Lone Pine, Alabama Hills, Semi Valley, Melody Ranch, Santa Clarita, Independence & Los Angeles).

But fantastical things happen regularly, such as a man drawing while covered against a cocked shotgun and easily killing the holder without the shotgun firing. Or a derringer appearing out of a skin tight shirt sleeve, the never missed shots by the stars, the almost instantaneous transformation by a slave who had never touched a gun into Bill Hickok. All of these could be accepted, perhaps, if the depictions of just about everybody in the film did not seem slightly off key. They just don't quite fit, including the Oscar winner Waltz who unlike his perfect and even superhuman performance in Inglorious Bastards has to make ends meet with a very imperfectly written character. He does his best, the movie is well acted by DiCaprio as usual and all the secondary characters except Tarantino who by now should realize his talents do not extend to his acting.

The movie just didn't do it for me.Not that I was 'offended' by the racism, or depictions of racism, nor of the depictions of virtually all whites with the exception of the doctor protagonist as shallow, hateful and prejudiced. That didn't colour my opinion.Not that I was offended by the violence and the expected over-the-top gore of a Tarantino work, in fact I laughed at the campy treatment of the lawyer in the big shootout, repeatedly getting unintended hits in the crossfire, spraying gore and howling at each new injury. (kind of sick when you think about it, but I laughed as was intended)Not that I was bothered by seeing Tarantino in his hubris, again insert his awkward and unconvincing actor self into a cameo role in one of his films, though the cameos would work better if he didn't look so much like a shorter Richard Keil knockoff ('Jaws', of James Bond fame) and stand out so obviously.The movie was just too damned long and too... boring. The 25 minute long dinner scene for example. Some think it brilliant and if they think so, well and good. But to me it shows a lack of editing. Tarantino must believe so deeply in his own cinematic excellence that he cannot allow what he has deemed should be filmed, to be trimmed. All footage stays in. But that's what editing is for, to keep a scene concise and keep the production from dragging, and folks, a 25 minute dinner scene doesn't build tension the whole time, it drags. Hitchcock would agree. Ditto the handshake scene. \"Shake my hand, it's what we do around here.\" \"I won't shake your hand\" \"Shake my hand\" \"No, I won't\"... on and on. It doesn't build, it drags. By that time the movie is already two and a half hours in and desperately needs to end, and lo and behold here the viewer is treated to a silly protracted argument that could have taken place in any playground, by little kids.Some epic tales such as Ben Hur are convoluted and involved and they take a long run time to depict on the screen. This is a short simple story that has been drawn out far longer than necessary and longer than it is comfortable to sit through.If I may employ a metaphor, Tarantino the film maker has always given me the impression of an impulsive adolescent who has taken dad's powerful sports car without permission, and is doing crazy things in it. He does things behind the wheel of that car that others haven't done, that the makers of the car never intended it to do, and people see it and say \"WOW, did you see that, that was amazing!\". But the more often you see Tarantino drive, the more it becomes apparent that what looked at first to be an astonishingly talented new driver, is in fact just a rather rash and undisciplined driver who is willing to take wild chances. Sometimes the result is brilliant, but things don't always work out for the best on every outing.This one, Django Unchained, wasn't one of Tarantino's better drives.",

The soundtrack is to never be forgotten, the acting was simply incredible (Christoph Waltz was especially my favorite in this film), and the story is unique and emotionally moving. Yes, it has the typical plot of one trying to fight back for his girl, but it is SO much more than just that. You witness the reality of the brutality toward the slaves, the compassion of slave- rights activists (such as Christoph Waltz's character), and the reality of needing to always fight for what you want. If Django Unchained taught me anything, it's that there are more forces out there stopping and discouraging me from achieving my goals in life than there is support; the only option I have is to literally live for and die for success in life. In fact, I don't have any other option than to live like that, unless I am OK going through life with people stepping all over me and my family. What a great film that will leave the viewer with quite a bit more adrenaline to get rid of the real bullies of their lives and finally be happy with who they are.",

            "content": "Revenge stories are a dime a dozen in Hollywood, but Quentin Tarantino has tapped into the perfect scenario for the genre in his latest movie, Django Unchained. In this bloody Spaghetti Western, Django, a black slave, exacts his revenge on the white slave owner who bought his wife and the white people who tortured him. This scenario is so perfect for a revenge story it's almost surprising that nobody has tried this yet, but the subject of slavery is still incredibly sensitive even after 150 years. I think Tarantino has created the ultimate cathartic experience that forces the audience to look at slavery in new ways.Jamie Foxx plays Django, a slave who was separated from his wife Broomhilda (played by Kerry Washington, and yes, her owner was German) and wants nothing more than to be reunited with her. He gets his chance to free Broomhilda when he meets the German Dentist turned bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz). Well, really Schultz tracks down Django, as he needs to identify three wanted men who used to be the overseers on Django's plantation.Waltz is a typical eccentric Tarantino character- always one step ahead of everyone else and putting a humorous spin on violence. Schultz purchases Django from his captors but more or less treats him like a free man. Schultz despises slavery, but he is not above exploiting the system for his own purposes. The German bounty hunter teaches Django all of the tricks of the trade and eventually Django surpasses even him. Foxx gives Django a cool, confident, persona. We can see the anger bubbling inside of him and he struggles to keep it under control when he witnesses the atrocities on slave plantations.In return for Django's services, Schultz offers to help him track down the man who bought Broomhilda. Their mission leads them to plantation owner Calvin Candie, a deliciously evil villain played by Leonardo Dicaprio. Candie possesses all the hallmarks of Southern hospitality, but underneath the surface is a crazed man. Candie's plantation is used for more than growing cotton- it is a place for slave death matches called Mandingo fighting. Django and Schultz hatch a plan to pose as slaver owners who are interested in buying a top notch fighter, but their real plan is to purchase Broomhilda. Their plan would have worked perfectly were it not for Candie's stereotypical Uncle Tom slave Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson). Needless to say, there are several bloody massacres that left me rooting for the hero harder than any movie in recent memory.Django Unchained might be Tarantino's most over-the-top movie yet with music from Ennio Morricone, rap artists,and shots that look like they were taken from Sergio Leone films. Like all of Tarantino's films, we are not spared from gore, as the first blood is spilt (more like exploded) within the first ten minutes. The racist jokes and the use of the \"N\" word are almost endless. Many people will find these qualities of the film hilarious, but some will undoubtedly be turned off.I think the greatest achievement of this movie is how it can start a conversation about slavery while still delivering an entertaining experience. Slavery is an under explored subject for Hollywood and I hope Django will influence more directors to tackle the topic from a black character's perspective. Hollywood has made highly acclaimed movies about slavery in the past, but Django is probably the first strong slave protagonist since Kunta Kinte.This movie should not be mistaken for a history lesson by any means. The depiction of the slave plantation has (at least) one serious problem in that Mandingo fighting is entirely fictional. But Tarantino touches on many elements of slavery in this genre piece. For example, even though the Mandingo fighting was fictional, it illustrated how people were desensitized to the horrible atrocities against African Americans in that time.Django Unchained also illuminates multiple methods of slave resistance. The obvious example is through violence, but Tarantino demonstrates pretty well that the power of slave owners was mostly psychological. The mere sight of Jamie Foxx riding confidently on a horse is enough to spark fear in the hearts of Southern white men and pride in black people. Simply breaking free of the psychological hold of slavery was a great form of resistance.Then there is Samuel L. Jackson's character. Resistance is not really the right word to describe his actions, but underneath his feigned loyalty is a man who is only concerned with his own stature on the plantation and uses every dirty trick in the book to rise up among his fellow slaves. He is exceedingly loyal to his Master, executing his rules like a prison guard, while pretending to be less intelligent and physically weak so people will underestimate him. Jackson might be smarter- and arguably more evil- than his own master. Django and Jackson represent polar opposites- the former working outside the system, and the latter working from within to achieve his own goals.Finally, Django Unchained is the only movie that I have ever seen that mentions the subject of black slave owners. They were rare, but they were very real. Django is utterly repulsed by impersonating a black slaver, but he grows into the role so well that the black people around him despise him.Django is not above criticism. I felt like the film could have been a little longer even though it was almost three hours. Parts of the film feel underdeveloped. Man did those three hours go by faster than The Hobbit though!Still, Django is one of the best movies I've seen this year. If you can stomach the violence and the language, I would recommend this film in a heartbeat. I think this movie will make the slave experience seem less like a history book and more like reality for many people.",

Implacable enemies, you dared not try. Temper your efforts by the sure awareness that oppression will make your enemies strong. The oppressed will have their day and heaven help the oppressor when that day comes. It was a two-edged blade. The oppressed always learn from and copied the oppressor. When the tables were turned, the stage was set for another round of revenge and violence--roles reversed. And reversed and reversed ad nauseam.\" This film is clearly an attempt to instill the desire for modern day blacks to hate and oppress any who disagree with their liberal doctrine who are willing to submit to everything the left insists upon. This is precisely the kind of oppression we have so often seen in dictators such as Adolph Hitler.With that in mind, Django is one of the most blatant attacks the left has made on conservatives that I've seen as it works to establish a tie between the ghastly world of slavery with modern day conservatives. That was certainly the message being presented at different points in the film. It should make it very clear that what the left wants is not equality but complete and complete and utter dominion.Though acts of violence were portrayed on both sides, including the brutal killing's of slaves and other brutality, there were other scenes in which even an unarmed white woman was gunned down simply because her brother (Leonard DiCaprio) was a villainous slave owner. Several black movie goers sitting near me giggled and laughed when she was gunned down. I found this extremely disturbing that a film would encourage this type of behavior and result in such joy from blacks in attendance.I'll stick to film work such as Alex Haley's Roots, A Time to Kill, To Kill a Mockingbird, In the Heat of the Night and other great works such as these which encourage an end to oppression and not the reversal of it. Nor do any of these encourage hatred and violence by one group on another.",

            "content": "Like Quentin Tarantino's last film, Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is an historical revenge fantasy. This time it's a mash-up homage to Blaxploitation films and Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns. Its entertainment value stems from the primal satisfaction of watching a freed slave kill white slave traders in gruesome ways.We're treated to Tarantino's usual masterful dialog and to some terrific performances, especially the supporting players. Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio are very engaging in their roles. And in what should be considered one of the strongest performances of his long and varied career, Samuel L. Jackson plays a house slave \u2013 the true villain of the piece.The story takes place in the American South, a few years before the Civil War. Jamie Foxx stars as Django, a slave who is unshackled by King Schultz (Waltz) -- a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter who needs Django's help in tracking down a trio of fugitives. Django quickly becomes Schultz's partner. \"Kill white people and get paid for it?\" asks Django. \"What's not to like?\" But Django has another quest in mind that's more personal. He wants to find his wife (Kerry Washington), rescue her from slavery, and head with her to the North. Schultz agrees to help him, and the pair set out for the plantation of Calvin Candie (DiCaprio) so that Django can find his true love and carry out a little (okay, a lot of) vengeance.If you're looking for a thoughtful drama about a man overcoming slavery and yearning for freedom, this isn't it. No, this is really just an action movie about a man trying to rescue his princess. (The character of the wife, Broomhilda, is seriously underdeveloped and we're never really shown why Django cares for her so much -- other than the fact that, well, she looks like Kerry Washington \u2013 and really, that may be reason enough.) This also isn't an attempt to accurately recreate the slavery-era. It feels more like an attempt to recreate '70s movies about slavery.There are also very few slavery movies that will make you laugh this hard. The movie is, at its core, very much a comedy. In one scene, members of an early version of the Ku Klux Klan complain about their hoods and the fact they can't see out of the eye-holes. It's one of the best scenes Tarantino has ever written. The only thing more satisfying than watching Klan members getting slaughtered \u2013 is watching them look like buffoons. Tarantino isn't trying to make us think or learn lessons about history. He's trying to entertain us. And, for the most part, he does his job very well.Typical of a Tarantino film, some of the moments designed to amuse the most \u2013 involve spectacular bloodletting. Using ultra-violence as a punch line is one of the director's specialties. He paints deplorable portraits of certain characters, and then builds tension to the point that when their absurdly excessive punishment is handed out \u2013 it serves as a cathartic release. The director plays on the audience's darkest instincts, knowing that on some level, many viewers like seeing bad guys get what they deserve in especially painful ways. Especially if it's \"just a movie.\" It's cheap. It's easy. But when choreographed by someone as skilled as Tarantino, it's also very effective.Not all of the violence is meant to provide perverse thrills, though. There are scenes that depict the brutality and inhumanity of slavery. They are difficult to watch, but serve to make the justice that Django hands out that much more satisfying. However, this creates a balancing act. Alternating between violence that is meant to horrify and violence meant to satisfy our blood lust creates a tonal inconsistency that plagues the movie.The violence isn't the only cause for controversy. There's also the frequent use of a certain vulgar, derogatory word for African-Americans. But its usage is historically accurate, and also mostly functions as shorthand to distinguish good guys from bad guys. If a character uses the word, it's a safe bet they're eventually going to get shot.My primary complaint with the film, however, is the pacing. Sadly, Tarantino's longtime editor, Sally Menke, passed away before production began and her absence is perhaps the reason why the movie drags. The beginning and ending are strong, but the second act is bloated and slow moving. The film comes to a screeching halt during a tortuously long dinner scene that's meant to build tension \u2013 but instead bores us. The long dialog scene is also designed to demonstrate the depths of Candie's evil racism. But it's unnecessary, given that his despicable nature is well established the moment he first appears on screen \u2013 a harrowing scene in which he revels in watching two slaves fight to the death. The long dinner sequence also mostly sidelines the movie's main character, causing the film's momentum to stall.Django Unchained is an enjoyable ride, albeit one that travels an uneven road and takes too long to get where it's going. If it had been steadier, leaner and about 40 minutes shorter, it may have ranked among Tarantino's best. But it's still quite an experience.",

It doesn't matter how overlong, boring, poor comedic timing, uninspired script devoid of quips or intelligence and how much over the top, gratuitous violence that is involved.First of all let me mention the overtop, gratuitous violence that is in Django. Filmmaking 101: Just because you throw galleons of blood on the screen, doesn't make it dramatic. In fact during some of the shoot out scenes I thought I was watching a parody/spoof of a western film! In tarantinos earlier films he balances violence with great filmmaking however he overdoes it and makes it look as if he was watching SAW on set.Secondly the script is bland, cringing and aching to watch unfold, just hearing the the characters spew out line after line of cheese devoid of quips, wit or intelligence. The touches of comedy throughout the film are misplaced as well, and left me squirming in my seat. However I give credit to the actors who really tried their best with the script especially Samuel L Jacksons 'Steven' who is evil personified, but I feel Christoph waltz's character was underwhelming and after seeing his role in inglorious bastards was a letdown. Jamie foxx tried his best to bring life to the poor script with Django but, left me checking my watch as Django was godawful boring to watch and un charismatic as a protagonist.Lastly the film is way overlong, coming in at a staggering 180 minutes it seems Tarantino could not resist indulging himself in his own ego fest. Many scenes could have been cut out completely or at least edited properly. I was left checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie (something I hate doing in a movie). The story was bland and uninspired, a clich\u00e9d tale of revenge where Goodguys vs Badguys! Surprise Goodguys win! The plot was predictable from the first 10 minutes but I still had another 170 minutes to go.It still stumps me how this is 96 on IMDb's top 250# list, it makes me wonder if people rate this high as it has Quentin Tarantino in the directors chair. This movie really showcases a classic example of just because you are successful doesn't mean you have a god given right to make anything you want without thought and consideration and still make a good movie.

            "review_title": "Django Unchained (2012)",
            "content": "Having built himself up as one of cinema's great auteur directors, Quentin Tarantino has struggled to surpass his finest achievement Pulp Fiction which became iconic for its constructive dialogue and fascinating characters when it was first released back in 1994. Though the likes of Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill I & II (2003/04) and Inglorious Basterds were generally well-received, they lacked the audacious elements of his second 'masterpiece' (his first being Reservoir Dogs!). However his latest film, the violent western Django Unchained, manages to reclaim those specific elements as he chooses to revive the 'spaghetti' sub-genre and blend it altogether with gratuitous violence as well as paying homage to several lesser-known westerns. There is also the small matter of its versatile cast which includes Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Di-Caprio and Christoph Waltz while awards recognition has already been sprung on the film including a couple of Golden Globe wins and several Oscar nominations. Mr Tarantino, you had my curiosity, now you have my attention\u0085.In the Deep South of 19th Century America, a slave named Django (Foxx) is rescued from capture by a charming but deadly dentist-turned-bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz who decides to use him as a partner. During their pursuit of a couple of rival bounty hunters, Django reveals that once he is free, he intends to find his beloved wife Broomhilda (Washington) who has been forced to work under sadistic plantation owner Calvin Caddie (Di-Caprio). The pair travel to Caddie's home as they look to try and negotiate with him about taking on a bounty even though their main objective is to rescue Django's beloved from her suffering. However when things turn nasty, our slave-turned-gunslinger instigates one final confrontation to try and save his wife once and for all.As he did with his depiction of World War II in Inglorious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino presents an equally gritty look of the Old West as he relies on old Spaghetti Westerns to influence his film-making through its plot and misc-en-scene. The latter in particular sees him use a Ennio Morricone-style score that is played throughout the film which lends a nostalgic feel to the days of classic Sergio Leone-type westerns. A running theme that is beginning to occur in the maverick director's filmography is revenge which shows up here again as Django vows to find his wife but decides to take down those who have troubled the pair in the past. This is all graphically conveyed by the violence, a key part of Tarantino's films, as his illustration of brutality reaches an all-time best courtesy of the constant blood and gore which occurs throughout. He also refuses to ignore the shocking treatment that the salves endured as he places the Southern mansions and 'mandingo' fights into the film to remind us that this was a traumatic period for the African-American race and that while things are better now, there is no moving away from what went on all those years ago. But amidst the scenes of violence and long-drawn dialogue from the slick script, we do get some light-hearted relief particularly in one scene where a gang of KKK members (including Jonah Hill in a very brief role) have a frank discussion about the uncomfortable masks they wear. It is these type of moments in the film that makes us realise that the director is having a lot of fun as he did with other comical moments in his past productions. Another key trademark is having a black and white duo as the leading characters which worked out well in Tarantino's renowned Pulp Fiction as the heart-warming friendship between our two heroes allows us to root for the pair as their story progresses. Jamie Foxx has a lot of fun in his role as Django as he mixes empathy and coolness to his portrayal of a man who eventually develops himself as a bad-ass hero. However he is overshadowed by his more versatile co-stars including the recently Oscar-nominated Christoph Waltz who is terrific as the charming but deadly killer who initially starts out as an anti-hero but becomes more compassionate about the mistreatment of slaves in the film's final quarter. A complete surprise is the villainous turn from an-against-type Leonardo Di-Caprio as he tackles the role of the unhinged Calvin Caddie whose vicious and disturbing personality is truly terrifying to watch compared to Di-Caprio's previous on-screen portrayals. Just as tyrannous is Samuel L. Jackson as the vindictive and loyal butler of Caddie who is more prepared to betray his own race rather than to help a fellow 'brother'. The stunningly-beautiful Kerry Washington is sadly reduced to being the helpless victim who uses her facial expressions to show her fragile side and is never given much of a chance to shine but is still an alluring sight nonetheless.One major criticism that does detract Tarantino's directing style is his excessive use of racial language which is driven to complete overload as the 'n' word gets spoken hundreds of times. While this was a tough period in US history that was blighted by the harsh treatment of African-American people, it is bound to unsettle some audiences who won't be prepared to handle a film which overwhelmingly uses countless racist dialogue. Think of it as a dramatic (and present day version) of Blazing Saddles! The director also makes the bizarre decision to use a strange Australian accent in his short role (something he has done in his previous films) which isn't necessarily needed considering the time the story is set but at least he gets an explosive send-off! Despite its overly use of the 'n' word, the D stands for delightful as Tarantino's latest violent spectacle tackles the Old West with true grit and influential-style while the likes of Foxx, Waltz and Di-Caprio saddle up and give roaring performances.",

There are the typical long-winded dialogue scenes that, mercifully, don't go on as long as his Inglourious Basterds or Death Proof shots did. There is the excessive gore and (way too loud) soundtrack \u2013 which happens to be his worst one, to date. And there is the quick zoom-ins that remind people that Tarantino loves those old Grindhouse films.Get past all that, like I did, and I did enjoy the journey of the enormously smart and quick-witted bounty hunter, Schultz. Oh, I guess, and his \"the 'D' is silent\" sidekick, Django.Picture it: the old West. Slaves haven't been freed and what is the deal with Lincoln-era films this year? Sorry. Where was I? Slave Django is acquired by Dr. Schultz in order to find three unwise men and after becoming fond of each other, the movie switches to the retrieval of Django's wife.Blood, tears, gore, comedy, revenge and bullets are all Tarantino Trademarks and you'll get an abundance here. Watch this for some quick wit, some slave owner's just deserts and overall, the awesome Christoph Waltz.",

            "content": "First of all before I begin let me start by saying that I have enjoyed all of Tarantino's films. Yes his violence in his films is somewhat cartoonish and a bit over the top, but that is also a bit refreshing to see to see violence for what it is VIOLENT!! Instead of the usual water downed violence that most movies employ. With that said this film goes way too far and I mean WAY TOO FAR! The violence in this film is not commensurate with the evilness portrayed in this film. This movie is insulting for intellectuals looking for a drama that reels you in and makes you think. The violence is so over the top it takes away from some very good acting. The performances by Jamie Foxx, Christopher Waltz and Samuel L Jackson are all very good but even their performance was not enough to save this film.I certainly hope that this is not the future of Tarantino and that he has not ran out of material to actually write and direct movies that have a plot and good story while still employing his unique directing style. I am so disappointed in this film and I feel robbed of 2 hrs and 45 min. I kept hoping the movie could somehow redeem itself at the end but more stupid, useless and out of place violence sealed its fate.My big concern now is that so many people enjoyed this film and it was nominated for Best Picture. What has become of us and our generation when we reward a film with such as this? If you just want a gruesome, violent, gory file they you need to look no further than any B rated horror flick.I expect more out of a movie and Quentin Tarantino. Yes his movies have violence and albeit at times the violence is over the top but his movies have always had several other redeeming qualities that put the violence into perspective. However this movie does not. It is needlessly over violent, incredibly stupid and insulting to intellectuals. SHAME ON YOU Tarantino!! You set the bar so low that any B movie director could beat it. I thought you were better than this.",

            "content": "My favorite Tarantino film so far, Django Unchained is a masterpiece of storytelling set in the backdrop of 1850's America where slavery is the norm. Dr. King Schultz and Django Freeman embark on a quest to enact justice upon the most wanted in the country while taking a not-so-slight detour to save Django's wife, Broomhilda. With incredibly well-shot scenes and excellent character development, Django fails to disappoint with both its deep dialogue and themes as well as its over-the-top action and blood (of which all in the film seem to be laced with gunpowder). DiCaprio as Calvin Candie, Jackson as Stephen, Foxx as Django and Waltz as Schultz present some of the best performances I've seen to date, fully embodying the good and evil of the Deep South, their facades as deep as the shallow mass graves. Touching on slavery isn't an easy thing to do, but Tarantino manages to weave these excellent personalities into the mix with fantastic dialogue that is both superficial at times but also peppered with meaning and depth. And as always, the soundtrack is wonderfully made with the help of Luis Bacalov and many others, providing a western that's on par with Clint Eastwood's greatest hits. Much like Tarantino's other films, Django Unchained fiddles with time and at first glance it may be difficult to understand the plot, but watching the film over (and over) again results in clarity befalling the viewer and the uncovering of uniquely grim, but expertly woven, metaphors that illustrate the desparity of the time.",

            "content": "L'infant terrible, Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds), has specialized integrating his encyclopedic knowledge of exploitive movies into reinvented, genre films stocked with top actors and highlighted by dialogue enriched scenes. The ultimate revenge tale in the guise of a slavery drama morphed into a western, Django Unchained is a highly entertaining adventure with a heavy dose of violence.It is the pre-Civil War South where cruel plantation owners treat slaves inhumanely, and guns rule the landscape. A former dentist, Dr Schultz (Christoph Waltz), is a bounty hunter and seeks his quarry by enlisting the aid of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx). It seems bounty hunting is a very lucrative profession, and it facilitates Django's freedom and a means to search for and rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), from a wealthy slave owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). As Schultz and Django devise a plan to win Hildy's freedom, Candie, who relies on the counsel of his slave-confident, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), begins to suspect a ruse and with time running out, it leads to an explosive, bloody end.Although his films tend to function and be appreciated for their parts rather than the whole, there are, of course, the Tarantino trademarks. He knows how to build a scene, and part of the fun is the delicious interplay among the key characters. As in most of his films, his characters are put in situations where there is an inevitability, a destiny if you will as the tension and looming threat of violence gets unbearable at times particularly in the climactic dinner scene. He also has a couple of scenes early on which are meant to fool the audience in which things appear one way but are really a clever misdirection.Foxx is quite the stud as the determined former slave, and DiCaprio is cast convincingly against type. Yet it is Waltz who shines here, and he makes the most of a role written for him.As he has done in all his previous films, Tarantino has resurrected former stars and character actors in numerous supporting roles. Part of the fun is trying to recognize a face under heavy makeup. Try identifying Michael Parks, Tom Savini, Robert Carradine, Bruce Dern, Russ Tamblyn, Don Stroud, Franco Nero (star of the original titled film), Don Johnson, Dennis Christopher, or James Remar.The film is heavily influenced by spaghetti westerns with the long stares and moody musical score. The action scenes are brutal and at times over the top; when has it not been so in a Tarantino film? One day perhaps, he should make a more intimate, gentle film to prove his versatility (like David Lynch demonstrated in The Straight Story).At 165 minutes, the film could use a bit leaner running time, but it is good fun if you aren't put off by the periodic, graphic violence. Tarantino may be a film geek with a nasty streak, but he definitely knows how to put together engaging, crowd pleasers, even if much of the material is cleverly recycled from older, obscure films. He has devised a crackerjack piece of entertainment, and while he says he wants to make a very limited amount of films in his career, if they continue to be as popular and well written as this and his previous work, we may have to wait a couple years or more for the next one. For his fans, it will be worth the wait.",

            "content": "I saw yesterday Tarantino's Django Unchained. The film deals approximately with the same historical period as Spielberg's Lincoln, but what a difference! Spielberg and Tarantino are without any doubt two of the most important American directors today. Both come from the let's call it commercial cinema like let's say both had remarkable blockbuster successes which translated into financial success enabling them to produce and direct everything they dream. Both use this success to explore with their personal craft tools, style and talent - various genres which they change and put their own imprint in. Both made films about the Second World War and about the Holocaust, and now about U.S. history, and the horrors and abolishing of slavery.Concerning the movies about the Holocaust and the Second World War I think Spielberg and Tarantino are tied at the highest possible level. Schindler's List was impressive and Saving Private Ryan is simply the best war movie I've seen, while Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds rewrites with a Tarantinesque chutzpah and expressiveness one of the final pages of the history of the Second World War.Lincoln and Django produced me completely different reactions. Spielberg appears to wish to say by all means that 'I can do serious films' and the result is Lincoln - a rhetorical film, in which characters make speeches even when they are in bed with their wives, a film in which I miss the thrill of discovery and emotion and the fluency of the story telling I love in Spielberg. On the other hand Tarantino tackles that time in history in Django with his usual boldness and lack of complex, he uses violent action cinema and makes a deep reverence to Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. The result is a sparkling film that is both fun to watch and passes the message.This is certainly a violent film, but maybe I should say something about Tarantino's violence (on screen) the way I see it. The exaggeration and complete lack of realism in the violent choreography of Tarantino's movies is his way of saying - do not take me too seriously. There is something more in this film however - the introduction creates the message of abhorrence towards slavery in a manner at least as efficient as Lincoln's speeches in Spielberg's movie.There is a lot of good cinema in Django which makes the film enjoyable also for the passionate of quality cinema. Jamie Foxx's rendition of Django, the liberated slave who turns into a professional killer in order to save his wife is dark and compassionate at the same time. Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson are a fabulous pair of surprisingly bad guys, and Tarantino himself and Franco Nero show up in minor but memorable appearances. And the story telling ... well ... it's good like in the good Spielberg movies.Django is my preferred 2012 film about the period of abolition of slavery.",

Soon after killing them though, Shultz and Freeman plan on freeing Django's wife, Broomhilda from the Candyland plantation owner Calvin Candie.MY THOUGHTS: Quentin Tarantino has done it again. I find the more and more movies he makes, the better and better they become. This movie was truly amazing. Very unique idea which was brought out and shot wonderfully. The action was amazing and the characters were very interesting. It had a perfect mix of action, comedy, romance, and seriousness. Christoph Waltz has yet another amazing performance as Shultz and Leonardo Dicaprio as Candie was also very threatening and well done.PROS/CONS: The action was amazing and being that it is a Tarantino movie, very blood-soaked. But it did of course fit the picture. Its been a while since there was a very good western and this film hit it right on the head. Christoph Waltz and Leonardo Dicaprio are by far the two best actors in this movie and you can't take your eyes off them when they are in there scenes. The film pulls no punches either by killing both Candie and Shultz at the end. Like an eye for an eye and I found it very exciting. Some people complain about the gore and language, but honestly it doesn't bother me. If you are paying to see a movie like that, that sort of thing shouldn't surprise you. OVERALL: 10/10 *MUST SEE*",

            "content": "The seventh film by Quentin Tarantino is a downright enjoyable, unabashedly entertaining & immensely satisfying extravaganza that finds the reputed filmmaker homaging the classic spaghetti westerns in his own stylized fashion while also toying with America's horrible past with slavery in an amusing but counterattacking manner to deliver a pulp masterpiece that's brutal, bloody & hilarious as hell from start to finish and is destined to please not only Tarantino's aficionados but majority of the filmgoing audience.Set a couple of years before the outbreak of the American Civil War, the story of Django Unchained follows a German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz who buys a slave named Django & promises to give him his freedom in exchange for his assistance in tracking down a trio of outlaws. But after learning of Django's past & his long-lost wife Broomhilda, Schultz offers another deal to him, makes him his partner in the bounty hunting business, and subsequently heads to the plantation with a ridiculous plan to free Django's wife from her cruel owner Calvin Candie.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, each frame of Django Unchained brims with his patented ingredients and is an ideal blend of all his trademarks. Passionately written & enthusiastically directed, the story packs in a remarkable set of characters, all of whom are brilliantly illustrated on the film canvas by its talented cast, and also celebrates his infamous lust for exaggerated blood- filled violence & spectacular wordplay, all illustrated on screen in bold, brazen & blatant style. There are several homages & parodies to be found here, but that KKK mockery is a standout in itself.Production design team does a marvellous job with its time-specific set pieces to recreate the 1850s ambiance, the wisely chosen shooting locations bring a credibility of its own while costume design department takes its inspirations from earlier examples of its genre with few fancy elements later added to it. Cinematography makes excellent use of the warm colour palette and employs several techniques such as long takes, clever angles, fluid camera movements, low-light photography & apt lighting to give those sequences a versatile look & feel while retaining the sharpness & clarity of those images.Its 165 minutes of narrative may seem daunting at first but its runtime is never felt for the most part. The film begins with a terrific sequence that introduces the two key characters and from there on, it moves forward with a rock-n-roll vibe that keeps getting better. The dialogues carry a playful tone, the humour is pure Tarantino and the stylized gun violence is delightfully engaging. The soundtrack makes heavy use of existing spaghetti western tracks (notably the ones from Ennio Morricone & Luis Bacalov) in addition to a few original compositions, all of which sync seamlessly with the accompanying scenes, as is the case in every Tarantino flick.Coming to the acting department, Django Unchained features an outstanding cast in Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington & Samuel L. Jackson, and all of them are just fabulous in their given roles. Foxx plays Django and his performance only gets better as the plot progresses. Waltz effortlessly steals the show with a compelling & charismatic rendition of Dr. King Schultz. DiCaprio plays the antagonist for a change and he's absolutely thrilling & devilishly charming in the role of the sadistic Calvin Candie. Washington does well with what she's given and then there's Jackson who never fails to leave his own mark and here, he's just as great as the rest.On an overall scale, Django Unchained is an absolute riot from beginning to end that showcases the best of Quentin Tarantino in the most direct manner as possible. Excessively stylish yet extremely sophisticated in all departments of filmmaking, this spaghetti western exhibits an incredible sense of fun throughout its runtime despite its provocative subject matter and delivers a roller-coaster ride that stays true to its genre's staples at all times. Possibly the best film of its year & definitely one of the finest in Tarantino's filmography, Django Unchained is an instant classic that makes ingenious use of all its resources to put on screen a cinema that's perfectly balanced in all aspects & winning on all levels. One hundred percent recommended.",

The characters' actions were generally uninteresting and the action was predictable. The violence was over the top, even for QT. How many times can he show a bullet causing someone's head/chest/leg/arm to explode? It wasn't boring by any means, it just didn't live up to my hopes for it.

Still, it's unpleasant from start to finish and in a drawn out and poor fashion.Part of Tarantino's charm is that his often juvenile sensibilities shine through in all his work no matter the subject matter. His work is usually entertaining and crisp first and foremost. Here, what's delivered is neither. There's his trademark bloody, cartoonish violence but none of it feels rewarding or is even captivating to be honest. The unpleasant message is hammered home time and again but with no charm. I certainly wasn't expecting a feel good film or a Charles Bronson revenge flick but I was expecting to connect with a character or two and was expecting more of a thrill ride. I found nothing of the sort in this film. What I did find is an almost three hour film that feels like five. I guess that's part of the creative decision but he seemed to sacrifice all entertainment value for a chance to drive home his white guy guilt angle. What results is a simplistic and poorly written plot with one dimensional stereotype characters drudging through as unpleasant of a story as possible.That's a tough way to spend three hours at the cinema.",

You would think that as a black slave who has suffered so much hardship, we would find something empathetic and endearing about him, but it's difficult to warm to him, and his character gets less and less likable in the second half of the movie. By the end, I actually saw him as the bad guy for mindlessly killing innocent folk simply because they were white. And no, I am not a white person myself.The ending is so over-the-top and clich\u00e9 it's laughable. The final scenes of his woman clapping him as he blows up the mansion, and does a little jiggly dance on the horse is something that might appeal to school aged kids, but seriously? What was Tarantino thinking? And to play modern hip-hop music whilst this is going on?

At the same time that Tarantino is showing off his comedic shops, he's also telling an exciting adventure of the titular hero as freed slave, underplayed just right by Jamie Foxx.Django joins with bounty hunter and verbal gymnast Dr. King Schultz (the not-quite scene munching Christoph Waltz), to kill wanted bad boys until Django and Schultz can free Django's wife, Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington), and kill her captors. Her owner, however, is Calvin Candie, a dandy plantation mogul, played with such relish by Leonardo DiCaprio that he may pick up a best supporting Oscar if not for other worthy candidates such as Tommy Lee Jones in Lincoln.But then there's another candidate\u2014Samuel L.

It's valid to dub this a companion piece to Basterds, seeing as it inhabits the same tone and plays along with the idea of revisionist history in ways the public never really thought imaginable. Quentin Tarantino has and will always be a genre-enthusiast, so we begin by addressing the fact that this film erects the style germane to spaghetti westerns of the 1950's and the 1960's (the title character, \"Django\" is taken from the 1966 Sergio Corbucci film, who was originally played by Franco Nero, who has a cameo in this picture as well). Tarantino achieves the look and feel by incorporating easy-on-the-eyes cinematography, familiar close-ups, the gritty look of the Deep South, and the bold, audacious red-letters during the opening titles and part of the closing ones. The film is as stylistically potent as Tarantino has ever been.Our story (told in an unusually linear fashion) concerns Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is bought by the dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), who has made a habit of listlessly wandering the terrain of the south, shooting those made famous on paper posters that are plastered all around town and proudly collecting the check. He teaches Django much of the same, how to protect himself and to conduct himself formally and ominously to evade certain doom in this time of intolerance and disrespect towards blacks.Django informs Dr. King Schultz of his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), and states both of them were separated when being bought by different men. Schultz discovers that Broomhilda was purchased by Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a spoiled, sadistic animal who resides in a mansion called \"Candyland,\" where black men are trained to fight (called \"Mandingos,\" more commonly) and black woman are forced into prostitution.The first half of Django Unchained is shamelessly violent and provides nonstop hilarity, as both Django and Schultz get acquainted with one another and become two of the most charismatic duos in the 2012 year of film. The second half is when the film shows us its real roots, a revenge flick on one hand, but a love story on the other, as the two men arrive at Candyland, running into Candie and his loyal house-slave Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson in one of the most un-Samuel L. Jackson-like roles), and try to strike a deal to buy Broomhilda from Candie, while covering up the fact that both her and Django are married.There are three things I've grown to expect in a Tarantino project and they are all here and present. Number one is an unbelievable wealth of talent. From not only Foxx as the title character, but Christoph Waltz who gave arguably the performance of the decade in Inglourious Basterds, this film is wonderfully cast and the performers here are captivating as they inhabit characters of several personalities accentuating them professionally because of their solid dialog. DiCaprio plays a villain full of menace and evil, and the long sequence at dinner, where we truly see his uncompromising menace is where we see it unfold. And it must be reiterated that Samuel L. Jackson gives a terrifically unconventional performance here one could even dub a character actor role.Number two is a hard-hitting first act, a satisfying second act, but a rambling and repetitive third. Django Unchained runs about twenty minutes too long, and because of that, one who merely enjoys this picture on its own merits, who isn't a passionate cinephile nor a devoted Tarantino fan could become tired or bored. That's the problem when you've built up such a strong and loyal fanbase is that by giving them what you want so many times and in mass amounts, you run the risk of turning off people who've tried to connect or enjoy your work and you make it more difficult for those on the fence to appreciate it. I've long-admired Tarantino's love for cinema and his extremely entertaining pictures, but I have my limits for every director and while he knows how to give cinephiles what they adore, he too knows how to push many buttons.Number three is his love for movies and the little aesthetics that go behind making every film work. This is shown explicitly in Django Unchained. From the obscure music choices (Luis Bacalov for the opening, Rick Ross and Tupac for a montage or two), to the detailed settings, to the impervious script, Tarantino gathers everything that makes films memorable, stylish, potent experiences and uses them to this film's advantage.Finally, too much has been made about how \"racist\" Django Unchained may be. The answer is in no way is this picture racist. It deals with racism, so perhaps people make too many feeble generalizations and forget to say that. As unabashedly violent and unapologetically gruesome certain sequences are, Tarantino constructs this picture elegantly and respectfully, often making the blacks smarter and more educated than the whites, and never shying away from the fact that slavery was a disgusting, inhumane act that has and will forever stain the fabric of humanity. To call this film racist for the sole purpose that it uses \"the n word\" and features slavery and not addressing its plot, content, or direction is a misguided, terribly underfunded statement.To scale this as an entire film is a bit tricky. At times uneven and unbalanced, and at others, devilishly entertaining, incredibly raucous, and persistently bloody, Django Unchained is an obscure work of art. To simplify my recommendation, so as not to turn off potential viewers who've likely been rather turned off by the subject matter or whatnot, I must say, there's something hear for all too enjoy, cinephile or casual moviegoer. It'll have me singing \"Djangoooooo\" for a while now.",

            "content": "This is an admirable adventure film and it probably reflect a deep change in American culture concerning the Blacks, African Americans. So far the great authors and playwrights dealing with the Blacks only or practically only showed the villainous hardships of slavery. This film surely shows a lot of that, but with a different eye than in Toni Morrison's Beloved or many other novels. It shows slavery as the most cruel and absurd social system ever invented but once again from a new point of view, that of a black man who gets out of slavery by accident and gets in business with a German immigrant and shares with him the profession of bounty hunter. That means he can ride a horse and kill white people, provided it is under the authority of his white associate and under the sanctimonious authority of a court-ordered mission, that of catching some fugitive criminals dead or alive. This black man has a vengeance to fulfill since his wife has been sold away to another planter, one of the worst in Mississippi. I will not deflower the film and tell you the details. This black man, Django, wants to find his wife and free her and in the end, of course, he will succeed, but what an adventure.The new element in this film is that beyond slavery, and we are just before the Civil War, some Blacks are recapturing their desire to be free beyond their fate of obedience. That fate is explained by the planter as being the result of some kind of a \"malformation\" of the skull. It is of course the result of nothing but the Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSS) they have been through in the daily suffering imposed onto them mostly for the pure and simple pleasure of the white planters and their white associates who are all shown over and over again as nothing but sadist dullards. We are here in a postcolonial approach that is only possible because the Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, also called Post Traumatic Slavery Syndrome is finding some kind of a solution, some healing procedure, some way of stepping over it and moving on. This has been a slow and long procedure and the Civil Rights movement, Martin Luther King, and now Barack Obama, and many others before and in-between, have been instrumental in that evolution. Blacks or African Americans are finally finding their self-respect, their self-freedom, their self-pride back and they can finally decolonialize their own souls, their own minds, as the CNN wrote so rightly on November 22, 2012. And when one's mind is free of any colonial heritage the sky is the limit and the White House is the first step to that sky.Of course the film is unrealistic, the weapons are as effective as missile throwers if not even rockets launched by some drone from the sky. Of course there is too much blood. But it is the first time some of the cruelty of these slave-owners is finally shown, alluded to and defused into absolute punishment. To be free in your soul you must be convinced your torturers have been punished, even those who were silent if not consenting witnesses. That means you have to finally remember and reconcile with and recommit yourself to the future and no longer remain enslaved to the past. That means forgiving the descendants of your torturers and that means the descendants of your torturers have to finally step over their belief you are inferior, which makes them superior without having to prove it. That's why this film is great. It is really the beginning of the end, maybe even the beginning of the day after the end.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",

            "content": "Over the years Quentin Tarantino has delivered some great films each getting better than before, but always stepping into new and different territories. After the smash success of his period film Inglourious Basterds, he once again travels back in time to tackle a period piece with Django Unchained. While there are some moments that pay homage to the original Django film starring Frank Nero, this is in fact an original film by Tarantino, but with its dark subject matter will it be too much for even Tarantino? Django Unchained follows a former dentist turned bounty hunter and a slave that he trains to become his partner to earn his freedom to help get a hefty bounty, but leads them into a face off against a ruthless plantation owner in hopes to free his slave wife. This is easily Tarantino's best film to date. He has taken a subject that is so dark and depressing and somehow managed to deliver something funny, violent, and intense like only he can. Jamie Foxx steps into this role and gives his all delivering a great performance. At one time it was talked that Will Smith was up for this role, but thankfully Foxx took it on because he has done something special here. Christoph Waltz is as good as always delivering a unique charm and charisma to his performance that really sucks you in. DiCaprio is not only as brilliant as ever, but throws everything he can into a role that is like nothing he has delivered before. The rest of the cast including some surprises all do a great job to bring this wonderful dark west to life. It's amazing how many really funny moments are in this film based on the subject matter. Most of these funny moments are not always intentional comedy, but just the ridiculous nature of how things were during that time. In addition the funny and dark moments, there is some vintage Tarantino with easily one of the most violently bloody western shoot outs to be seen in some time.While everyone has their Tarantino favorites, it will not be a surprise if this one tops them all as the most ambitiously brilliant piece of cinema. Tarantino wanted to make his own spaghetti western and has done that and so much more. This once again proves the brilliance of Tarantino and sets the bar high for whatever he decides to do next, much like Inglourious Basterds did before it. If you like westerns, blood, Tarantino, or anyone involved in this film you need to get out and check it out. It has a run time of about 2 hours and 45 minutes but moves along and entertains so much you will never notice.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Well, after two viewings and endless analyzing, it's time to commit thoughts to the page. Over the years, it has become very clear that a Tarantino movie generates a first reaction, and then proceeds to slither through your mind and morph into something else entirely. It would be very easy to accept this latest as an outrageous peek at slavery disguised as a spaghetti western. For most filmmakers, that would be plenty. The \"whole\" here is exceedingly impressive, but the real joy for cinephiles is in the bits and pieces.One need not be a Quentin Tarantino expert to enjoy his movies, but there are a couple of things that help. First, he is at heart, a true lover of cinema and quite the film historian, showing sincere respect to the pioneers of this art form. Second, he loves to bring visibility to issues (large and small) by poking a bit of fun at the evil doers who wield unnecessary influence and control over weaker parties. Morality, vengeance, revenge and come-uppance invariably play a role in his story-telling ... a bonus this time is the inclusion of the Brunhilde/Siegfried legend from Norse mythology and the Wagner operas.In his two most recent films, QT has been on a kick for revisionist history. Inglourious Basterds made a strong statement against the Nazi's, while this latest goes hard after slave owners. As you might expect, historical accuracy is less important to him than are the characters involved and tales they weave. And to that point, it seems quite obvious that where in the past, Tarantino would center his attention on crackling dialogue and searing one-liners, he now offers up much more complete characterizations ... these are people we understand, even if we don't much like them.The obvious love he has for Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Leone, the driving forces behind spaghetti westerns is plastered on the screen. We even get the beautiful camera work through the snow as a tribute to Corbucci's The Great Silence (1968). While this is not a remake or sequel or prequel, Franco Nero's \"I know\" response to \"The D is silent\" generates a laugh and memories of a 25 year old Nero in the titular role of \"Django\" (1966). The Blaxploitation genre plays a significant role here as well since Jamie Foxx plays Django, a freed slave who buddies up with a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter, so that Django can get revenge on those responsible for the torture and mistreatment of his wife.The details of the stories will not be exposed here, however, I would encourage you to pay close attention to the moments of film brilliance. There is a running gag with townspeople and slaves alike struggling to accept the sight of Django on a horse. You'll laugh again when Django is offered the opportunity to pick out his own clothes and we see Foxx in a velvet Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit straight out of The Blue Boy painting from Gainsborough. There is hilarious banter between Big Daddy (Don Johnson) and Betina as he tries to give guidance on how to give Django a tour of the plantation.Some of the best moments occur when we recognize the actors in the vital foundation scenes. Don't miss: bad guy Bruce Dern, Don Stroud (the drummer in The Buddy Holly Story) as the sheriff, Tom Wopat (Dukes of Hazzard), father and daughter Russ and Amber Tamblyn, Jonah Hill who struggles with the eye holes in his \"bag\", the eyes of Zoe Bell, Ted Neeley (Jesus Christ Superstar), \"Dexter\" dad James Remar has two roles, Walton Goggins as a gunslinger, Michael Parks (multiple roles in Kill Bill and Grindhouse), and of course, Mr Tarantino himself (as an explosive cowpoke from down under).While each of these provide wonderful moments, it's the main performances of Jamie Foxx (Django), Christoph Waltz (Dr King Schultz, bounty hunter), Leonardo DiCaprio (Calvin Candie, plantation owner), and Samuel L Jackson (Stephen, Candyland house slave). Any combination of these characters in any scene could be considered a highlight. It's especially enjoyable to see DiCaprio cut loose after so many uptight characters recently. Samuel L Jackson has long been a Tarantino favorite, and his delivery as the diabolical Uncle Tom house slave who has some secrets of his own, will bring the house down when he first sees Django and, in a much different way, when his suspicions are confirmed. Power is big player in the story, and even as a slave, Stephen knows what to do with power when he has it. Mr. Waltz won an Oscar for his Inglourious Basterds performance, and his dialogue here is every bit as rich. It's obvious how much Tarantino enjoys hearing his words spoken by Waltz. Foxx' performance could be easily overlooked, but it's actually the guts of the film. He is quiet when necessary and bold when required.We must also discuss the soundtrack. Franco Migiacci's original \"Django\" theme is featured, as are classics and a new song from the great Ennio Morricone. If you doubt the originality of the soundtrack, can you name another western that utilizes a mash-up of James Brown and Tupac Shakur? How about a spot-on use of Jim Croce's \"I've Got a Name\"? The film is beautifully shot by Robert Richardson, and Fred Riskin takes over for Tarantino's long-time editor Sally Menke, who sadly passed away in 2010.It should also be noted that the script puts hip-hop to shame by using the \"N-word\" more than 100 times. It is a bit disconcerting, and you can google Spike Lee's comments if you care to read more on the topic. Otherwise, dig in to the latest gem from Tarantino and appreciate his approach and genius ... either that, or stay away!",

            "content": "I was looking forward to a great western including what I presumed would be a deservedly negative portrayal of slavery. There was a clue right in the beginning of the sickness that would come to dominate the film, but it takes a while to realize where you are being taken. So the clue: Advice from our hero to some freed slaves that they should murder their subdued captors, said with a smile.The movie continues with a sense of joy and happiness in sadistically killing people. Two bounty hunters head off initially killing wanted men (criminals), but then it branches off into killing white southerners. When Django (one of the bounty hunters) is asked what he thinks of their task, he responds \"killing white people and getting paid too, what's not to like.\" In the same way, perhaps early Nazis got a piece of paper from a superior authorizing them to round up men, women, and children, and have a great time killing them, this movie develops that strange sense of moral \"okay\" because it is written on a piece of paper. So, for example, because a warrant says dead or alive, the bounty hunters take this to mean that having-a-blast killing has now been authorized. So, instead of easily arresting a criminal, you shoot them, put them in pain, and then before a crowd, and with a smile, kill them dead.In another great scene, as the movie slips further into its killing spree, a wanted man is plowing a field with the help of his son. So from a distance, they shoot him and listen to the horrified son say, \"Oh, dad.\" You would think that this is somehow setting up for making a deep statement about slavery. Well, no. Our bounty hunters (one white, one former slave) eventually decide to rescue the former slave's wife. Why not just go get the wife? It seems they want a properly documented sale. Back to this notion that be it a warrant or a bill of sale, these pieces of paper are all controlling. An interesting point, but it gets lost in all the joyous killing.One last example: Django asks a couple of female slaves to say goodbye to a southern bell, and then shoots her (along with all the other whites). I guess he was worried she might curse at him---how can Django been seen as anything other than a murdered? I had hoped for some sense of morality, of review of slavery, of a fantasy of righting some wrongs. However, the movie just wants to have fun murdering and with different reasons, setting up people to be casually executed.It is worth noting that it was Abraham Lincoln, having witnessing the horror of all the killing, wished to purge slavery and heal the nation. The north did not send out squads to murder the southern white population in joyous revenge.I object to presenting a movie that carries with it the message that given some basis of moral authority, you are then free to enjoy and needlessly murder to your heart's content.",

On that day, Jackie Brown and QT's shout outs to 70s Blaxploitation made my holidays worthy of celebration. From the good (White Dog), to the bad (Mean Johnny Barrows), to the flat out nasty (Maniac), B-movies have remained my greasy burger cure for Hollywood hangovers and nobody understands this craving better than Tarantino.Because of Death Proof, I marked 2007 as the end of Tarantino's short, but impressive career. Inglourious Basterds made me realize my prediction was a tad premature and last night's Xmas screening of Django Unchained had me swallowing my half-eaten words. In short, props are due: Quentin Tarantino -- the fast-food auteur -- is back on the map. What's also back is his talent for turning plagiarism into art and elevating the B-movie into art house splendor. Derivative yes, but this is a special talent no other rip-off artist has done as exceptionally well as QT. Tarantino doesn't merely copy, he cuts and pastes, and if plagiarism is art, Django Unchained is 2 hours and 46 minutes of glorious B-movie cinema spooning.While Django Unchained is a Runaway Slave flick bacon-wrapped with Spaghetti Western sauce and splattered with 'Argento Red' buckets of blood, it's also a monument of empowerment for a no-bullshit Hero who happens to be Black and proud. Despite refusing to watch DU, Spike Lee argues Tarantino is trivializing Slavery, an argument ignorantly reminiscent of the Catholic Church's attempt to smear Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ. The fact is, Tarantino's portrayal of slavery (and white supremacy) is contemptuous. Over and over, Tarantino exposes viewers to the viciousness, brutality, and ugliness of slavery and the racists responsible for it. He then ridicules these racists before he sends them all to hell at the hands of a true (Black) Hero.There really is only one thing to hate about this film and it comes in the form of a self- indulgent Director's cameo. Distracting beyond words, the scene is fortunately short lived and tactfully punctuated by Tarantino having himself blown to smithereens. Nitpicks aside, Django Unchained is steeped in so much of the 70s it looks, sounds and feels like golden age deja vu. With deserving cameos from Franco Nero (the original Django) and Bruce Dern, to the countless flashbacks recalling Peckinpah, George Roy Hill, Jeremiah Johnson, and volumes of others, Django Unchained is a cinematic standout in a digital age gone wrong. Do yourself a favor this holiday season and go see a brand-new Classic...on film (if you can).",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's latest film is neither as stylized as his previous work or as interesting. Instead, the filmmaker has made what very well may be his most normal film, creating a Western that is as traditionalist and American as the Coen Brothers' True Grit. Now, this is by no means a bad thing; however, Tarantino is capable of making something that is much more entertaining and off the wall than this film. At its best, the movie is an exhilarating and well acted western, and at its worst it is a disappointingly middle of the road film by a well respected director.The plot concerns the plight of Django the slave. Through a lucky turn of events he comes across the bounty hunter Dr. Schultz, who is looking for the Brittle brothers, and he believes Django can help him. After Schultz kills the slave trader that are holding Django in chains, the two set out to find and kill the Brittle brothers. After this feat is accomplished, Schultz learns that Django wants to save his wife Broomhilda. Schultz offer his assistance in exchange for Django to continue working with him. Eventually they make their way to Mississippi where Broomhilda is a slave on the massive plantation of Candyland, owned by the ruthless and insane Calvin Candie. From there the movie is a revenge flick, just like the last four movies by Tarantino.The highlight of the movie is certainly the acting. Jamie Foxx plays Django with an honesty and passion that has gone unmatched in his previous work. He gives the role a true hero quality and does a great job of getting the audience to really root for him. Not that his opposition is particularly likable in anyway. Cristoph Waltz plays Dr. Schultz, which is essentially a much nicer version of his character from Tarantino's previous effort Inglorious Basterds. Here, he takes on the role of the wise old wizard who helps the hero gain his full potential. The performances by Samuel L. Jackson as a mean and bitter house slave and Don Johnson as a womanizing plantation owner are also great. But the best performance would have to be from Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie. Here he plays a deranged and flamboyant plantation owner who is very easy to hate. DiCaprio, Foxx, and Waltz are phenomenal, and the rest of the cast bring a lot to the table, creating some of Tarantino's most interesting characters yet.The acting is great, and for the most part this is what saves the movie. However even this has its slight flaws, including a scene involving Australian slave traders (one of them played by Tarantino) who have maybe the worst Australian accents ever.As for Tarantino's writing and directing, this almost seems like the antithesis of Kill Bill, his two part film that encompassed nearly all genres and was so ridiculous that it is probably his greatest work. Here, however, Tarantino goes for a much more subdued approach. It has been said that Django Unchained would be a spaghetti western, much like the classic films by Sergio Leone and the original Django. However, Tarantino's style is much more in line with traditionalist American westerns, which is fine in and of itself, but he isn't very good at making that kind of movie. This is by far Tarantino's most conventional film, and as a result his most boring. Even Basterds, which this reviewer found underwhelming, had a lot of interesting aspects to it. But Django is so normal in its plot and its style that the other aspects that are quintessential Tarantino become a drag. Even the music choices seem less inspired than any other movie he has made.As for the film's commentary on slavery, it brings to the forefront some serious and complicated ideas that every Hollywood movie has avoided or dumbed down. For this alone the film deserves a vast amount of credit. Tarantino doesn't shy away from the cruelty and the malice of the racism that dominated the south in the mid 1800s. The film is unsentimental and unheroic in its depiction of the treatment of slaves, and the film is more damning of the institution than any other movie that has been made on the subject, perhaps because Tarantino is not interested in forgiving the government for allowing such a horrible affront to human rights to occur for such a bitterly long time. However, some of the humor Tarantino puts into the film undermines the seriousness of it all, much in the same way a Broadway showtune undermines the misery of being imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread.The movie isn't all bad. In fact, far from it. Tarantino's classic dialogue is exquisitely done, especially at the tense and intentionally overlong dinner scene. The final set of shootouts are exhilarating and bloodier than anything that has come out in a long while. However, there seems to be something missing from this film that is present in almost every other Tarantino flick. Perhaps that something is originality; because, lets face it, this movie is a revenge movie, Basterds was a revenge movie, 2007's Death Proof was a revenge movie, and Kill Bill was a revenge movie. It seems strange to say this, but Tarantino could benefit greatly from branching out.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com",

Of course, whether it is the leading role or the supporting role, the performance level of each actor is commendable, which can be said to be very committed, and it is easy to bring us into the story. The director chose to shoot in the United States, which vividly restored the social environment at that time, and it can be said that it is easy to bring the audience into the past. Under this premise, the story telling can be said to have a very obvious effect. Of course, this film also seems to criticize some ugly faces in the old American society, and also oppose the landlord class at that time and some things against the black people. I think that for the black people, it should be a work with very strong influence and leadership. Of course, I also like the soundtrack of the film very much.

No one dare say anything against this guy , but hopefully one day someone other will seriously look at this and will see through the hype and say no the stuff he makes isn't pastiche of films from yester year, lets be fair about it , the movies of this ilk were crap then and nothing has changed. The camera shots are those of an amateur, the acting for most part is wooden, (Fox in particular acts like a Pinochio puppet with all the emotional charisma of clotted cream ) De Caprio is perhaps the only sparkle in this drab, very drab affair. The script is laughable and the repeated shots of the worst Kensington Gore I have ever seen being thrown up walls is quite truthfully childish. As for the end shots , surely a candidate for the raspberry awards. Sorry, if this thing had been made by anyone other than this director then audiences, even American ones, would have given it the thumbs down. But I guess all will hail this masterpiece of garbage and not see it for what it is. A poorly made piece of amateur stuff whose plot just doesn't hold up, made by actors who at times look embarrassed to be there, shame they were really.",

            "content": "Hi, 6 years have passed since the release of Django Unchained, but since I care a lot about this movie, I decided to wait to have the right words to talk about it.\nDjango Unchained comes out in 2012, but since I'm not a western enthusiast I decide not to spend even a minute of my time watching the aforementioned, considering it the usual movie of \"cowboys against Indians\". In 2015, however, on the advice of friends, I reluctantly start the vision. Start, they spend a few minutes and are already open-mouthed, wide-eyed and \"stuck\" to the screen. I am immediately struck by the beauty of the music, the charisma of all the characters and the originality of the script. A \"powerful\", intelligent, flawless movie that can \"immerse\" the viewer in the plot from beginning to end. A masterpiece surrounded by the presence of formidable actors, such as: Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson and Oscar (best supporting Role actor) Christoph Waltz. Tarantino exceeds himself in this movie, for all aspects, treating the subject of slavery in an original way is never seen and bringing back the plot to the Nordic mythology and the tale of \"Siegfried\"; giving the film a touch of \"magic\" more. Nothing in this film is obvious and everything has an explanation, for every killing, from the death of \"Ace Speck\" to that of \"Calvin Candie\" and \"Stephen\" there is a plausible reason that justifies it, making this movie not turns out to be a trivial action movie. To conclude, I make the most sincere congratulations to Quentin Tarantino, for what they are worth, for writing and shooting one of my favorite movies. See you at the next review ...",

            "content": "On my continued journey across Tarantino films, the next that was immediately available to me was Django Unchained. Of the Tarantino films I've seen, this is my least favourite although I've only seen 3 others. Despite this, Django Unchained is an excellent film and worth-watching.Like many Tarantino films, it is well-shot, well-acted and expertly written. The dialogue is once again a highlight and once again we see Tarantino's remarkable ability to imbue dialogue scenes with huge amounts of tension. The film doesn't shy away from the brutality faced by slaves yet like Inglorious Basterds, there is a masterful balance of humour and drama.Of course the cast and characters are excellent. Jamie Foxx does pretty well as Django however he does lack some of the charisma and range that other Tarantino protagonists possess in the films that I've seen. Obviously, the star of the show is Christoph Waltz as Dr King Schultz, completely charismatic, charming yet angry and upset at the treatment of slaves. Another major standout is Leonardo Dicaprio as Calvin Candie. He brings such menace and humour to the antagonist and while he doesn't reach the heights of Hans Landa, his introduction and presence provides the most amount of tension in the film.Overall, Django Unchained, while my least favourite Tarantino film I've seen, it is still an excellently acted, directed and written movie and is a terrific movie nonetheless.",

            "review_title": "Violence's Ambiguity in Django: \"Dead Alive\" in the Antebellum West",
            "content": "The title of my review references Peter Jackson's utterly unhinged zombie infestation cult horror classic. In \"Dead Alive\", the unlikely hero decimates zombie hordes until the screen literally floods with blood. In a way, \"Django Unchained\" (hereafter \"Django\") reflects \"Dead Alive\"'s \"go nuts with killing until you stop being scared and disgusted and just have to laugh\" sensibility. As Django (Jamie Foxx) ascends from slave to bounty hunter to talented gunslinger to determined avenger and savior, the viewer is inundated with so many killings, humiliating tortures, mutilations, and explosions, he/she may stop being disgusted and overwhelmed, and simply laugh at the brutal inanity of it all. I think that was director Quentin Tarantino's intentional satiric objective.Reviewer M. Oleson also alludes to \"Blazing Saddles\" as one of \"Django\"'s inspirations, and I think he is correct. However, satirizing the West's violent ignorance and flimsy attempts at justice were, I believe, Tarantino's secondary targets. Even the abominably shameful institution of pre-Civil War slavery and the unscrupulous but dense Southerners who strained to uphold it is a secondary, easy-bullseye for \"Django\"'s satire. As other posters here have mentioned, Tarantino, as he has done before, is slyly satirizing our near-sexual fetish for and obsession with and gradual desensitization to violence in general.Many people are shot in \"Django\". The lucky ones die quickly with little blood. The unlucky ones realistically scream with pain as blood erupts from them like geysers. Initially, the audience may recoil or cheer in response, depending on whether the character shot \"deserves\" it or not. But eventually, poetic justice does prevail in \"Django\" and we laughingly and apparently appropriately cheer as decadent, immoral Southern plantation society is literally blasted to smithereens. But will we necessarily respect ourselves the following morning? No matter how you feel later, I think \"Django\" viewers will be entertainingly uplifted, not only by Django's composed, steely determination to avenge his bondage and to be reunited with his abused but beautiful and equally resilient wife Brunhilde (Hildy) (Kerry Washington), but also by the unflappable reasoning and eloquence of Django's own deliverer, the deceptively unassuming Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). But even Django's reprehensible villains are also humorously captivating, such as the unctuously effete but vicious pseudo-Francophile Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), the slimy \"Candieland\" (ho ho!) plantation owner who holds Hildy in thrall, and especially the obsequious but treacherous Candieland slave retainer, played by the endlessly versatile Samuel L. Jackson. Of course, they suffer shocking deaths, but Candie and Stephen come so skillfully close to being such cartoonish heavies, again we permit ourselves to cheer and laugh when they die.Tarantino in a sense has it both ways with the violence. We are allowed to enjoy the violence when a villain buys it, but we do shudder with loathing when the \"good guys\" suffer. When Hildy is locked naked in a hot box for some perceived slight, or Django is hung upside down naked with castration imminent, I'm sure almost no viewer will laugh. So there's our ambivalence towards violence and death - are they cathartic or poisonous? If violence's victims are faceless zombies as in \"Dead Alive\" or foolish Southern whites (who cant even make KKK masks with peripheral vision) as in \"Django\", we laugh with relief. If violence's victims are the geeky hero in \"Dead Alive\" or suave slave-turned-avenger Django or wily, rational bounty hunter Dr. Schwartz, we cry with despair. Especially in light of recent serial killings, this evocation of violence's dual nature merits further debate.",

            "content": "Here's the more focused and emotionally satisfying take on revenge. Where Inglourious Basterds ultimately falters in its final moments, Django Unchained thrives. The former sees a certain disconnect between its disparate acts of vengeance while the latter integrates them really well.A group of slaves is being transported through the wilderness of the American South a few years before the outbreak of the American Civil War. A German dentist intercepts them and desires to purchase one of them from the traders transporting them. This is Dr. King Shultz, played spiritedly by Christoph Waltz, and he uses five words when one will do, but always at the service of making himself clearly understood. He rubs the traders the wrong way and gunplay gets involved. Shultz kills all but one, pays for the slave he wants, the eponymous Django, and leaves the rest of the slaves alone with the one trader who has become pinned under his horse.So begins the roaring rampage of revenge that is Django Unchained. Dr. Shultz is a bounty hunter and he's out to find the Brittle Brothers, former foremen on the plantation that Django had previously been held at. The mechanics of bounty hunting, the danger of it and the background of Django's separation from his wife are all played out in an extended sequence in a small Western town. Dr. Shultz kills the sheriff calmly and, just as calmly, demands to see the local marshal. Shultz then precisely explains that the sheriff was actually a known outlaw with a bounty of several hundred dollars on his head and that the marshal owes Shultz money for killing him. That's the movie's comedic streak in a nutshell. It's very dark and, if you're into that sort of thing, very funny.After the pair take care of the Brittle Brothers, the real plot of the film takes hold. Shultz is going to help Django get his wife back from her new plantation, a place called Candieland in Mississippi owned by the wealthy and cruel Calvin Candie. There's a small detail about Candie that I love. As Shultz walks into the Mandingo Club where Candie is watching a fight, Candie's lawyer explains that his client loves all things French. Shultz immediately breaks into French as a way to help ingratiate himself to his host, but the lawyer quickly puts a stop to it. No, he explains, Monsieur Candie doesn't actually speak French, and to do so in front of him would embarrass him.Django and Shultz are playing parts in trying to ingratiate themselves to Candie. Shultz is a wealthy man of leisure who is looking for something to add interest into his boring life while Django plays a Mandingo expert who's there to help guide Shultz's decisions. They want to entice Monsieur Candie into bringing them to Candieland where the German speaking Broomhilda, Django's wife, is being kept. They'll dangle the prospect of a large purchase of a Mandingo fighter in front of Candie, accidentally meet Broomhilda, fall in for her charms as a German speaking slave, and purchase her as a side element to the main deal for the fighter, which will never actually come to pass.The play their parts well, and the most interesting part is Django's ability to watch slaves beating each other to death with their bare hands so calmly. It's not that he's a nihilist or unmoved by the plights of these men, it's that he understands his role and his goal. If he wants Broomhilda, he's going to have to tolerate this and even approach the topic with some enthusiasm. His cruelty towards these slaves is what will help sell the ruse and get him his wife back.Calvin Candie is a great villain, but Stephen, the house slave played by Samuel L. Jackson, is even more insidious. He's so invested in the maintenance of his master's status quo that he's willing to be just as cruel to Broomhilda as Candie is. It's Stephen who pieces together the small inconsistencies in the story the new pair are telling to determine that they are never going to buy the Mandingo fighter and their only objective is the female slave. It doesn't matter to him if Broomhilda is going to find freedom or not. His master will be at the business end of a raw deal, and he wants nothing to do with that.He tells Candie, of course, and Candie allows for Broomhilda's purchase, but at the price promised for the Mandingo fighter. He won't let his victory stay though, and he proceeds to further humiliate and insult Shultz. Once Shultz has enough, he blows Candie away, dying quickly as a result himself.The stage gets set for Django's ultimate rescue of Broomhilda and his bloody revenge. And here's where Django succeeds. We've invested in Django's journey, his rescue. The final bloody rampage isn't just historical revisionism, it's the culmination of Django's labors. He's earned the narrative right to kill everyone on that plantation who's standing between him and Broomhilda. It makes the ending far more satisfying than Tarantino's previous effort.Again and again, Tarantino's movies look great, and Django is no different. Colors are lush. The sets are wonderfully realized. Acting is universally good, especially Jaime Foxx as Django and Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie. It is one of Tarantino's most fully realized and satisfying films.",

            "content": "Every time I see a bad review of this film, they always focus on one thing: The rather liberal use of the n-word throughout the movie. The movie is offensive because of the n-word, they say, as if that alone negates everything that was done well with this movie (and there is a lot done well).Oh look, they use a derogatory term for black people for a movie set in an era where black people were barely considered \"people\" in the first place. Oh look, they use a racist term for a movie set in a time when being a racist was pretty much the norm. The movie is bad for that reason alone...Really?OK, I understand that, as a civilization, we are trying to grow up and move away from prejudice, but to condemn an art piece meant to depict a less-developed time because it clashes with your modern morals is, well, immature. Another thing, you act as if the movie directly insults you. At what point was the movie directing its insults at you? Not only are you offended out of context, it's also misdirected! How self-righteous and immature do you have to be to--- You know what, forget it. It's got nothing to do with the movie so it's not worth getting into.What is worth getting into is why this movie is awesome. Considering this movie pushes the 3 hour mark, I'm amazed that it kept my attention through out the whole thing. That says something for the film because I'm one of those kind of guys who can barely keep focused on anything for more than twenty minutes. But here, I found myself intrigued by every single scene and how the story moved forward. So this movie gets an A from me from storytelling merits alone. Dialogue is balanced with exposition and the script, while shoddy in a few places, works well overall. The narrative is very much character-driven which I think is the film's biggest merit. It doesn't rely on big sets or numerous filler montages. The action scenes are short and brutal. And they should be because there's nothing fancy about the shootouts and these scenes are mostly direct to the point and leave a big impact. This ain't no kung-fu movie. The movie is all about the interaction and conflict if it's rather diverse and talented cast. Speaking of whom...Though I think he's the weakest of the main characters, Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz is still a very notable performance, probably one of the best in Waltz's career. I love the way he serves as the wise mentor figure in the story as well as providing most the comic relief. Schultz's cleverness displayed in the film is fun to watch and lends a certain respect to his character. And though he is played to be lighthearted most of the time, there are instances where we definitely see a hidden depth to Schultz. That said, it's also the character's weakness because, you know this guy has a long and likely very interesting history, and yet very little of that history is explored within the narrative. And that sucks. This guy should have his own movie really. But of course the movie is focused on the title character Django (with a silent D) played by Jamie Foxx. This movie is all about Django coming to his own. Foxx handled that splendidly in my opinion. When we're first introduced to the character as a nervous and broken man who seemed lost in just about any environment, portrayed in a way that, strangely enough, reminded me of Forrest Gump somewhat. But as the story progress, Django matures, learns the ropes, gains confidence in himself, takes more risks, and generally grows from being Schultz's student to equal. Foxx's portrayal of this development is commendable. If you watch just the first and last 15 minutes of the movie, you'd think he was playing two completely different characters. Watching the movie is a whole, the gradual transformation of Django from rookie to pro is amazingly subtle though. Foxx's excellent performance makes sure that Django's development doesn't come off as forced or contrived and is believable throughout. But my favorite character would be, hands down, Calvin Candie played by Leonardo DiCaprio whose performance is, in a word, sublime. Candie simply eats up any scene he's in. Even if you wanted to, you simply cannot deny his presence. And while he starts off as a non-too-serious antagonist when first introduced, we quickly realize that this is a man that one does not want to hang out with on a social basis. But that realization happens without the guy being overly diabolical about it, which lends to the believability of the character. And when Candie eventually does go off the chain he easily becomes the most memorable villain in film history. Much respect to Waltz but how DiCaprio did not get more Best Supporting Role award nominations (especially at the Oscars) is beyond me. I don't have much to say about Samuel L. Jackson's character, Stephen, as he really only serves as a plot point that leads into the climax of the movie. Many people don't like it when you get a big name to play what is essentially a throw-away character. But I'm fine with it. For what little screen time he had, Jackson gave an excellent enough performance to be memorable.So basically, yeah, awesome direction, awesome script, awesome characters played by awesome actors makes for a definite hall-of-famer in my opinion. This film will stay with me for a long time. It's a brutal, bloody, brilliant take on the darker parts of America's history not without its fair share of humor and wit. A must see film for anyone with any measurable appreciation for good cinema.",

            "content": "As Tarantino lived through the 60s, it was expected that he would make a western sooner or later and he sure enough delivers.Django Unchained follows the journey of freed slave Django and his trusted bounty hunter friend Dr. King Schultz as they try to locate the Brittle Brothers and save Django's wife from a cruel plantation owner.Tarantino returns three years later to present us with a terrific, over the top western that provided the audience with memorable character, laudable dialogue and action that is a direct crowdpleaser.The characters are well written and wouldn't be the same if other actors played them. The chemistry between Django and Schultz seems very authentic due to the fantastic performances of Waltz and Foxx as well as Tarantino's impeccible writing. The role of Schultz was made for Christoph Waltz and he owns the film. His delivery is so endearing and likeable to the audience that when he's not in a scene, you do wish to see him in it. Jamie Foxx also does a good job. His transformation from being a quiet freed man to a gun-slinging hunter is well done and his performance shows it. Despite DiCaprio's late arrival, he shines in his role. His character bares resemblence to Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds in terms of the way he speaks to the two bounty hunters but DiCaprio makes Calvin Candie his own and leaves a great impression on the film. As well as DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson makes a late appearance but steals every scene with his hilarious delivery and expressions. Finally, Kerry Washington gives an earnest performance as well.The film has a runtime of 2 hours and 40 minutes but not once does it feel that long. Tarantino's trademark of excessive dialogue is present throughout but none of it is boring. Each conversation is investing as it gives an insight on the personality of each character fleshing them out completely by the end. The story is predictable but Tarantino adds elements of unpredictability during the dialogue driven scenes which invests the audience further and when something huge takes place, you feel it and wonder what will happen next.The costume design and sets are beautiful to look at which in return add a level of authenticity to the style of the film. The music is well utilised. I mean Tarantino even used rap songs by Tupac and Rick Ross in the film and somehow it worked.Altogether, Django Unchained is another amazing film in Tarantino's arsenal. The acting provides a sense of realism to the characters as well as the dialogue which is equally as intriguing. The film has some really funny moments and character building scenes that allow the runtime to feel as short as possible and the action is just a beauty to behold.

            "content": "It's been said that Quentin Tarantino has lost his edge, and the evidence of Death Proof and Inglourious Basterds supports that. But that doesn't mean he's making poor films now. I may look a fool in a couple of days but I predict Django Unchained will pick up two Oscars tomorrow night: Best Original Screenplay for Quentin Tarantino and Best Supporting Actor for Christoph Waltz.It isn't classic Tarantino and it's far from a great movie, but it has elements of classic Tarantino and is a fabulously fun frolic with some stunning imagery and a bucketful of belly laughs. The dialogue is mostly sharp, frequently funny and largely eschews the trademark (and tedious) irrelevant soliloquies and it dances with as much action as the visual fights and explosions around it.The principal issue is that Django Unchained is just too long. The 165-minute running time isn't an issue per se, but it has far too many potential climaxes and doesn't know which one to take. More than that, Django Unchained isn't quite sure what type of film it is and has too many slapstick moments and odd scenes that change the direction of the genre without committing fully. Clearly Mr T set out to make a great film but perhaps the danger of having his level of success is that producers are afraid to step in when he veers away from great storytelling and into the danger zone of personal whims.Waltz, as the dentist-turned-bounty-hunter, Dr King Schultz, who buys Django (Jamie Foxx) his freedom from slavery is superb. He finds the right balance between sincerity and humour to be entirely compelling on the screen and some many of the funniest moments come courtesy of his brilliant delivery. Schultz is a more stable and reserved character than the Inglourious Basterds' Col Hans Landa but he is even more watchable because of it and Waltz seems to have cornered the market in gently off-kilter nut jobs.Foxx, playing against type in perhaps his most memorable role since Ray, is a joy to watch from the moment he arrives on screen looking like Darnell from My Name is Earl through to his transmogrification into the free man consumed with violent, bloody revenge as he searches for his wife. He duels with humour and steely anger with equal aplomb and is every part the leading man, though he would be little without Waltz by his side.Both Leonardo DiCaprio, as Calvin Candie, the plantation owner who owns Django's wife, and Samuel L. Jackson, as Stephen, his slave-cum-butler, have a good go at stealing the film and both bite great chunks out of the scenery in their contrasting roles. DiCaprio plays nasty in a cruel, vindictive kind of way and has surely shaken off the pretty boy days of Titanic now, but it is Jackson who has the most indelible effect on us, though that may not be always for the best reasons. Yes, he gives us enough to know that Stephen is as unpleasant as his is funny, but too often his antics as the old slave wander into the world of pantomime and needless slapstick.Tarantino isn't always generous to his actresses, though he has given us some great female characters. Broomhilda, wife of Django, is no Jackie Brown but Kerry Washington plays her with depth and compassion. She is the beauty, the sincerity and the reason for Django Unchained and as such she carries the weight without fault. While Tarantino serves us up plenty of horror, it is Washington that gives us reason to pause and contemplate the harsh inequalities of life in the deep south of America before the civil war.Musically, Tarantino is usually on the button, but here he again seems confused with the effect he wishes to create and, whereas Plunkett & Macleane placed modern music in a period film to clever effect, in Django Unchained there are times it jars. The music is inconsistent and occasionally pulls us in the opposite direction to the action. It isn't a reason not to watch this, but at times it just feels wrong.Tarantino's greatest skill is in the overall feel and effect of his films and, in his third collaboration with DoP Robert Richardson, he is bang on the money with most of his shots. Django Unchained isn't merely sprinkled with great shots, it's littered with them. Tarantino does spectacle well and here he is in overdrive. Heads explode, bodies erupt with geysers of blood, limbs audibly splinter and, in a moment of pure beauty, cotton plants turn into swabs as another demolished body sprays claret the full length of them. Stunning.Stunning, funny and beautiful. Just too damn long! For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",

A single bullet also does not a person's head to explode like they just put a grenade in their their mouth. I don't understand the reasoning for this over the top ridiculous level of graphic violence. The movie doesn't need it. It's like they are trying make society think this is normal or invoke some other sickness on an already violent world. Also, lets do some research. People did not wear holstered pistols in 1855. They hadn't even invents those type of holsters yet. People didn't openly carry guns. If they even had a gun it was most likely just put in a pocket. And Django's sunglasses? Come on! Lastly... the character \"Broomhilda?\" What is that? The name is Brynhilde. Broomhilda was a character in a comic strip. No German couple would name a girl Broomhilda.",

I LOVE a Good Western - This is NOT a Western in ANY sense of the word! It's a pure Political statement, That's a cover about as transparent as a Victoria's Secret see-thru white lace bikini!! These divisive Political statements ALWAYS turn me off - Right or left, they attempt to over-blow reality in an attempt to stir up emotions and change minds- Let's be 100% honest, Has ANYONE EVER had their mind changed by a movie or Documentary?? NO! That's why they usually stink! Because we are looking for entertainment with a good storyline, and some T&A!! Get us away from our reality! Not rub our noses in YOUR DREAMS AND DESIRE to Murder WHITE PEOPLE!! Spike says he won't EVER see Django Unchained, and he's boycotting it - I can see EXACTLY WHY that is!! 1st of all - I've seen enough blacks killing blacks, whites killing blacks, blacks killing whites- AKA; People killing People to last me a life-timne! So to watch this was Grotesque and Vile to be honest. I mean WOW!! This isn't a movie about anything at all, except for (in Jamie Fox's own words)\"Killing a bunch of white people\". I have seen 100s of Westerns, and seen plenty of \"white people\" shot up in them- so I am not sensitive to shooting holes in made up white people, or any other made up people in the movies, But I have NEVER seen it done with malice to MAKE A POINT of some sick sort. Spike Lee said He will NEVER go see such a pointless and honestly HORRIBLE movie. I wish I had listened to him before I went! As far as Westerns go, the shoot-em up Movies are some of the best, But they ALWAYS start with a story, and then add the cause, and the guns were the tool of the day to resolve disputes etc.. But this \"Movie's\" must have 1st started with the idea of killing as many white people on screen for FUN as they could hire and they tossed a 2-bit story around the already determined agenda! No Lie - It wasn't even a \".1\" on a scale of 1 to 10, it's that bad!",

It's the story of a slave turned bounty hunter who goes in search for his wife.Jamie Foxx as Django was great. But the scene stealers were DiCaprio, Samuel L Jackson and Christoph Waltz. All three were terrific, and although Waltz got the academy award, Jackson and DiCaprio were equally deserving.This is not an action film, though whenever there is action, it's great. Not everyone will like this movie. Some people will get offended, and some will get grossed out by the hyper violence. But this is exactly what I love about Tarantino. He doesn't pull his punches, and is completely unapologetic.The movie is also very humorous. There is a Klu Klux Klan scene that had me in splits. It's easily one of the funniest scenes ever filmed.The first time I saw this movie, I thought that the movie was 15 minutes too long. However on subsequent viewings I realized that if I had been the editor, I would not have edited anything out of the movie. And if one can't think of anything to cut, then maybe it's not the movie's flaw. Maybe I just prefer short films.I'm going with 5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "The way Quentin Tarantino begins his little yet very rich essay on Sergio Corbucci (published by Fangoria magazine on its January 2013 edition) could very well be a perfect beginning for a review/essay/article on DJANGO UNCHAINED, Tarantino's fist feature film since INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009). \"Reimagining the Western genre for his own ends, Sergio Corbucci used cowboy pictures, and his vast knowledge of them -not to mention his expertise on Japanease samurai pictures- to explore and examine the evils inherent in fascism\"; if we change the name Sergio Corbucci for Quentin Tarantino, and the word \"fascism\" for \"slavery\", we would have a great resume of what DJANGO UNCHAINED is. In his essay, Tarantino talks mainly about the great violence and cruelty featured in the work of Corbucci \u2013 whether DJANGO UNCHAINED is Tarantino's most violent film or not is a matter of perception (KILL BILL could be my other choice, but there will be people who think that INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is or even RESERVOIR DOGS for its ending and that famous torture scene), but without a doubt this is his most cruel movie. Forget every other performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, even his brilliant collaborations with Martin Scorsese. This is his very best work so far, and it's a real shame that he's not even nominated for the Oscar. His villain Calvin Candie is the pure representation of that cruelty Tarantino found in Corbucci's world; Candie is a young man who was born and raised in the plantations, who is used to everything related with slavery and therefore bored, so he finds the fun he needs in the Mandingo fighting business: black slaves who fight to the death. DJANGO UNCHAINED turns to be a brutal slavery movie; if INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (with the exception of one sequence) didn't show the brutality of the Nazis to the Jews (with tons of films about the holocaust it wasn't necessary), here we do see the tortures and all of those slavery issues that apparently are often ignored by American movies. The commentary is certainly strong (Samuel L. Jackson and his great character Stephen is a proof of that), but this being Tarantino in his purest form, the hilarious moments are constantly present. Tarantino plays with the way white racists are (and with the classic look of the KKK) \u2013 in one particular scene, for instance, we see Django (Jamie Foxx) as a free man, riding a horse, and the plantation owner \"Big Daddy\" (little but brilliant performance by Don Johnson) can't easily explain to one of his female slaves how she has to treat Django (his guest): yes, he ain't no slave but neither is white! For the second consecutive time, Tarantino took the name of an old Italian film, focused on a genre and on a violent and sad chapter in the history of humanity. In \"Basterds\" he had the presence (and blessing) of Enzo G. Castellari (director of the original), so it was obvious that Tarantino was going to seek the same with the original Django Franco Nero (Corbucci passed away in 1990). Nero's cameo, if you know the context, is quite memorable; otherwise is probable that, specifically, the scene between him and Tarantino's Django feels a bit out of place. But the presence of Nero is only one of the many elements that indicate the great determination Tarantino had in order to not disappoint his fans and himself with his first official Western.The director has had Ennio Morricone music in more than one of his films (KILL BILL, DEATH PROOF and \"Basterds\"), but never before *original music*. With the tune \"Ancora Qui\", \"Unchained\" became in yet another Western scored by Morricone \u2013 at this point is almost unnecessary to say that Tarantino perfectly knows those details that make a modern movie something glorious for the old fans of the respective genre. As a pure Western, \"Unchained\" offers some sort of alternate version of the beginning of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, in which the Good and the Ugly are a bounty hunting team. Here we have Django and the German Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz, who once again shines and make the Americans read some subtitles). Jamie Foxx is genius \u2013 I never thought Tarantino was going to do again a similar scene to that from KILL BILL in which Bill is by a bonfire telling a story to the Bride. Much less with both Foxx and Waltz; Foxx's Django shows some innocence, and obviously he's too a mythical figure from the Old West (the Deep South really) that won't disappoint anyone seeking for a violent Spaghetti Western. This is the first Tarantino movie with a straight love story \u2013 in KILL BILL love was certainly a constant motivation, but here his protagonist Django is an ex-slave whose one and only goal is to rescue his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is a slave of Candie's plantation in Mississippi. Tarantino doesn't show any kind of fear and he is making from a Western, with the slavery thing as background, a fable with a princess that waits for her hero. As any great film, \"Unchained\" was much better the second time I watched it an I have no doubt Tarantino has a new MASTERPIECE; with great action, tension, music, brilliant performances, dialogs, sequences and decisions (mixing songs by 2Pac and James Brown for the great climax, for example \u2013 this left me a bit confused the first time). Best movie of 2012!*Watched it on 17 & 18 January, 2013",

            "content": "I'm a cinephile but I wasn't looking forward to seeing Django Unchained. Still, since I had some time, I went to the theater where the film was being screened. Django Unchained is a long film. Its running time is 165 minutes. Some people say that Quentin Tarantino is a great filmmaker, so he must have filled this project with meat. But no. There's just not enough meat here to justify the long running time. Instead there's fat and plenty of it. After Inglourious Basterds (2009), which is one of his best films, Tarantino wanted to make a spaghetti western. But he wanted the setting to be the Deep South before the Civil War. So he called his project a \"Southern.\" He's not the first filmmaker to twist the word. Russian filmmakers made Western-like films as far back as the 1960s. They called them \"Easterns\" or \"Osterns.\" One of the best films from that genre is White Sun Of The Desert (1970). Tarantino also said that he wanted to tackle the issue of slavery in the United States because America hasn't dealt with it well. The plot of Django Unchained is a simple one. Tarantino doesn't shy away from showing some of the worst abuses that happened as a result of slavery. But he still keeps things entertaining. The actors deliver good performances, especially Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. The film contains some of Tarantino's best written dialogue. The gunfights are some of the best ever committed to film. Despite all this the film is still, for the most part, a stylistic failure. For such a simple story it's too long and there are a number of scenes which serve no purpose. Tarantino gets good performances from the actors but his direction doesn't impress because he didn't do a good job at building scenes. He's known for including things that he likes in his films. Here he goes too far by including too many of his influences and too many songs that aren't really suitable for the material. Tarantino's previous editor Sally Menke knew how to cut his footage for a good result and when to reign him in. But now that Fred Raskin is the editor the film doesn't seem like the work of a great director. So, even though the cinematography by Robert Richardson is beautiful and even though the film is entertaining we still get something that seems average but bloody as well. With better direction and better editing it could have been a great film. Django Unchained is also Tarantino's funniest film yet. I recommend it but my recommendation isn't enthusiastic.",

Nothing - the trailer, posters, bloopers, scenes, screenshots - nothing actually defines this movie until you watch it.

And when big fishes like Tarantino, Morricone, DiCaprio, Waltz, Jackson & Foxx are a part of it, it's a blockbuster. The soundtrack is mind-blowing, editing realistic and direction par excellence. Django Unchained is a masterpiece!The plot is very simple but the way you predict it will shame you because in here nothing happens like we think, guess or comprehend. Every scene after one will spark your mind constantly and will please you. The screenplay is not non-linear but the flashbacks will make you scream in pure entertainment joy, of course! Django Unchained is a masterpiece!Scenes of shotgun firing, blood clots, boom-baam-boom, scream, growl, Leo's shouts, Waltz's pleasing conversation style, Jamie's ultra-uber gait and his expressions will make you go crazy. And the timing of evergreen songs will just mesmerize you. The violence scenes are gory, cold-blooded and aptly put at the right time so that you indulge more into it. And the western antebellum era makes it more enduring. Django Unchained is a masterpiece!DiCaprio's vindictive portrayal of the ruthless plantation owner may not be his best (and his screen time is low as I had expected), but I could compare him with Depp for the characterization. Christoph Walt is charming, straightforward and pure genius while Kerry Washington totally complements the whole cast with her countenances. Django Unchained is a masterpiece!Now, I could talk talk and talk or maybe write a book about my experience in native hospital but to end this review I have to admit I was amazed by the story, and I have to say I cried a tear during it. Love is in the air and I believe revenge is the sweetest thing, provided you succeed. Django Unchained is a masterpiece!QT's best was Pulp Fiction but this could be if it wasn't too violent but I think it the violence level wasn't Jedi her, it could've spoiled it. I was also a bit disappointed with the editing but that's okay.

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is an excellent,brutal and bloody Western and is an instant classic. Filled with great dialog,great direction,memorable characters and stylish Action,Django Unchained is not only a Western Classic,but a Tarantino classic.Set in 1858,two years before the Civil Wat,Django Unchained tells the story of a Black slave named Django(Jamie Foxx)who is freed and rescued from a dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz(Christoph Waltz). After being freed,Django teams up with Schultz and becomes a bounty hunter. While they're doing well with their bounty hunting,Django and Schultz set their sights on rescuing Django's wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington)from a charming,yet sadistic plantation owner named Calvin Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio). Rescuing Broomhilda from Calvin isn't going to be easy for Django and Schultz and it will lead to a bloody,brutal and surprising climax.Django Unchained is a brilliant film because,despite it's subject matter,the films works because of Tarantino's take on the Western,the main characters,the dialog,showing the horrors of slavery and it's stylish violence. One of the things that I love about Django Unchained is that Quentin Tarantino has basically brought a Spaghetti Western film into the modern film world,giving viewers a film where everyone and everything is exaggerated and over the top and it's done in a harsh,stylized and darkly humorous way.Tarantino brings the same surreal and stylized feel that he brought to Inglourious Basterds and his recent films,showing viewers not a realistic world,but a Tarantino world where anything can happen and they're no questions. DU is epic in terms of the way it's filmed and length(165 minutes)but it never drags or slows down and the film is told in two half,the half when Django and Schultz are bounty hunting and the second half when the duo meets Calvin Candie and like I.B the film builds up to a violent conclusion. DU is to the Western genre like I.B was to WW2 films. The characters in the film are memorable and unforgettable,especially the characters Django and Schultz who are likable and are cool,charming and have a good chemistry together and as the film goes on you start to relate to them and understand who they are and what their motivations are. Unlike the characters Django and Schultz who are likable,the character Calvin Candie,while charming,is just pure evil and horrifying. From the moment Calvin steps on the screen he is so distasteful and unlikable that you feel that there is no redeemable quality in this character or has a touch of sympathy in him. Calvin loves to treat his slaves like dirt and loves to instill pain and fear onto his slaves and has no remorse for what he does. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliantly written and filled with great scenes of funny dialog and moments of dark humor that will have you laughing and stick with you after the film is over with the best scenes and dialog with Django,Schultz and Calvin Candie. As great as the film is,DU will also divide viewers because of the themes of slavery and use of the N-word. Slavery is a heavy subject to tackle with and Tarantino doesn't hold back on the Horrors of slavery,showing the pain,fright and violence blacks went through during the times of slavery and sometimes it's hard to watch. The use of the N-word will offend people as well,but as viewer it doesn't really bother me because I believe Tarantino was just being truthful about the time period of slavery and blacks having to deal with racism being called the N-word most of the time. While most of the film is definitely a fantasy,Tarantino takes time to bring lots of reality to the film. The Action and Violence in the film,like other Tarantino films, is well-done,over the top and bloody done with rapid fire intensity and brilliance. At times when a person gets shot,you'll feel the pain and sees lots blood and feel like your in the movie. The ending of the film is masterful and explosive with violence and bloodshed that will have you cheering and laughing at the destruction of the film and will have you rooting for Django and one of the reasons Django Unchained is a classic.The whole cast does an excellent job. Jamie Foxx is excellent as Django(the \"D\" is silent). Foxx brings a toughness,grit and a iconic presence to the role. Christoph Waltz is brilliant Dr. King Schultz,bringing a coolness and clever glee to the performance. Foxx and Waltz's scenes together are great and the actors have great chemistry together. Leonardo DiCaprio gives an outstanding,delightful and over the top performance as Calvin Candie. DiCaprio's brings a terrifying,funny and disgusting presence to the role and is unforgettable. Calvin Candie ranks alongside I.B's Hans Landa as one of the great Tarantino villains. Kerry Washington is wonderful as Broomhilda,Django's wife,with Washington bring depth to the role. Samuel L. Jackson is great and funny as Stephen,Calvin's loyal house slave. Next to Calvin,Stephen will probably be the most hated character in the film. Also lookout for cameos by Don Johnson(Big Daddy),Franco Nero(the actor who played the unconnected Django in the 60s),Jonah Hiil,James Remar,Bruce Dern,Michael Parks,Dennis Christopher,Walton Goggins(Billy Crash),Quentin Tarantino himself and many more.The direction by Quentin Tarantino is masterful using great camera angles,zoom-ins and close-ups and giving the film a great style.The Western and Action standoffs are excellent and well-executed by Tarantino as well. Great direction,Quentin.I love the soundtrack in the film,especially the Django theme song by Franco Migliacci,Luis Enriquez and Rocky Roberts.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Westerns,Action or Cinema in general,I suggest you see Django Unchained a true classic of the Western genre and one of Tarantino's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

As an enthusiast in American history, I have an appetite for this kind of film. I knew this was gonna be historically inaccurate from the jump, but when was the last time you've seen a movie like his?Django Unchained is set in 1858, two years before the American Civil War. A German bounty hunter Dr.King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) frees a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) from Texan slave traders. They work together as bounty hunters to hunt bad guys in exchange for Django's freedom and eventually finding his enslaved wife. Through- out their journey in the Deep South, they come across Mississippian Plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) who owns Candyland. Right here is one of my favorite performances by DiCaprio. Candie also has a second-in command. House Slave Stephen whom is played by Samuel L. Jackson. Throughout the movie, you get a lot of the typical Tarantino stuff. Great dialogue, music pieces, high-octane bloody random violence, etc. Speaking of the violence, there's a quite a few unique gun battles you won't usually see in other movies. It's highly rewarding and entertaining once you experience them. My one problem with the Tarantino's latest movie was it's racist undertones. The main character Django says a line \"Kill white people and they give you a reward, what's not to like?\". First, he said that right next to a White German that showed him kindness and gave him freedom. Second, why would a movie portray such a subtle message like that? As one-dimensional as the movie was, it's really putting an Us vs. Them mentality on the whole race thing. However, this can sort of he made up when the movie has a \"White good guy\" (Dr.Schultz) and a \"black bad guy\" (Stephen). So it isn't trying to portray all people of a race as bad or good.Django Unchained is like any other QT flick with the exception of that this one tells the story with a a more linear plot. It's a lot of great fun and has a lot of personality as said before.",

This is a very entertaining action movie. Recommended to be watched carefully. 9/10 and I'd give it a whole 10 if the end was less hilarious. I liked it!",

            "content": "As this Tarantino western opens Dr King Schultz approaches two man transporting slaves through Texas; he is a bounty hunter and one of the slaves can identify the men he his hunting. That slave is Django. Schultz tells Django that when the men are dead he will be a free man. Once he is freed they start working together collecting bounties before heading to Mississippi where Django's wife is a slave on an infamously brutal plantation. They intend to buy her freedom but must keep their intentions from slave owner Calvin Candie or he is likely to refuse just because he can. Once at the Candyland plantation house slave Stephen proves to be their greatest danger.Anybody who has seen any of Quentin Tarantino's previous films will be unsurprised that his is quite violent at times. The story is well told with likable protagonists and some very unpleasant antagonists. The setting, earlier and further east than most westerns, doesn't flinch from depicting the horrors of slavery and attitudes that mean people expect the highest of manners but think is is perfectly acceptable to order a runaway slave be torn apart by dogs. The cast does a fine job; Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz work together brilliantly as Django and Schultz and Leonardo DiCaprio is great as the racist Candie. Samuel L Jackson also impresses as Stephen; he is possibly the film's most disturbing character, a slave who despises and betrays other black people. Given the subject matter one might not expect much to laugh at but there are a few really funny moments; the best being when a hooded lynch mob start complaining that they can't see properly with their hoods on\u0085 it was almost like something one might have expected in 'Blazing Saddles'. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of other Tarantino's films or fans of the genre who aren't put off by the level of violence.",

The film is very much a tribute to the spaghetti western.The film tells the story of Django (Jamie Fox) a slave who is befriended by a bounty hunter Dr Shultz (Christoph Waltz). The main reason for this is because Django can identify the people he is looking for. He soon realises that Django has a skill for bounty hunting and decides he would like to hire him as a deputy bounty hunter who takes 1/3 of the bounty.In addition to the direction being excellent most of the acting performances are also great with Waltz being the standout performer.

            "content": "(Note: This is a rewrite of a review that respectively was poorly written and didn't truly convey my emotions of this film. So as the Bud Light people say, Here We Go.) I officially saw this film twice in the theaters and so far my reactions are the same. This film is a work of art and I repeat a work of art. Not since The Departed has a film literally had everything in a bag of potato chips. Tarantino found a way to not only throw his normal crap in, (violence and such but we'll get to that later.) but he did with respect to the historical reality that was Pre-Civil War treatment of slaves. Was there a loads of racial slurs thrown around like the bullets throughout the film, no doubt, but guess what people, that's the way it was. Sadly to say, our nation's wealthiest people back then treated slaves like they did in this film and in some cases worse then portrayed. The fact Tarantino didn't go deeper shows the respect he has for his moviegoers by not turning this thing into a Schindler's List, which he could've easily done. Another thing he did that was impressive was turning Jamie Foxx's Django from an uneducated tortured slave into one of the most necessary characters in film. Not a black hero (that's been done before) but a server of justice that couldn't be done in a real world scenario. Something that I would hope even the likes of Al Sharpton and Spike Lee would appreciate (Oh wait they can't get away from the fact that Tarantino made the script real to the times).In regards to the highlights, aside from the script the acting was excellent all around. Leo played a great ruthless plantation owner and Waltz was equally great as Django's mentor. Both of them could easily get the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor this year and in fact they were both so good it will probably give Tommy Lee Jones the win due to the divide it will cause. Plus Samuel L. playing as the stereotypical Uncle Tom was great as well, and I know it's great because I didn't enjoy it as much as my fellow African-American moviegoers did. There are so many other great performances that are great but I can't even mention right now because there are so many but now we have to address the haters.To All Haters: You all have a right to your opinion, but take the following arguments out before you make a statement. 1. The violence: It's done on purpose, Tarantino has a knack of using a lot of corn syrup during his films and this case there was enough to throw a kickin Halloween party. But to those that say this is wrong and it causes shootings and things like that (Someone actually said that Hmm), read into the tragedies and then make statements like this cause if you really want to say He's partially responsible for Aurora, then blame Christopher Nolan for the kid being inspired by The Dark Knight (read some stuff and you'll understand). 2. Racism: To anyone who believes this film is racist should join the Spike Lee club for Complete Separationist. Like what was said earlier, N word used a lot, straight up, but anyone with a brain could see Tarantino if anything was doing a nasty stereotype on the South. He portrayed the Southern Slaveowners as generally uneducated and ones that couldn't even do a raid right (that scene was hilarious by the way). Also if Samuel L. Jackson (who was a former member of the Black Panthers, look it up) was willing to be in it then it can only be so bad. Final Analysis: This film maybe long, but it sure as hell didn't feel like it to me and that's always a plus. It's worthy of multiple views and that's a plus and even though it's over-the- top, it's over-the-top with class and that's something that should not only be appreciated in the future but it should be taught to other directors (Michael Bay maybe). Plus this film has an equal balance of humor, violence, drama, and suspense which in the end should be enough. So if you're not a prude, come on in, sneak in a snack before you enter the theater, and enjoy the Best Film of 2012 and it's not even close.",

The 165 min. runtime wasn't a bad thing either. It was also hysterical at some points which it fit with the music and mood of the point in the film. Tarantino's style of this movie made it seem like it was a true western style film with a modern adaptation, the music and special effects.

It's only a fairy tale, per se, but my main motivation in seeing Quentin Tarantino movies is the lesson in influences they give me. They're a cinematic history lesson directed towards pure entertainment and leave out any potential for dull moments. It also challenges any idea of \"fun\" you may have. As strong as any of his other flicks (and, more importantly, cinema in general), it is a perfect blend of dialogue and scenes propelled by a sweet soundtrack. There are some terrifying moments, one which should give Leonardo DiCaprio an Oscar nomination at least, but they aren't meant to last long, and an intense grand bloody finale is cut short to lead into another finale, as if it's a re-do, for a more satisfying conclusion. As perfectly edited as each scene is, I wonder if the last 15 minutes would have benefited better from the late Sally Menke (Tarantino's editor for the past 20 years). Not to give any spoilers, the movie gives you what you want if not what you expect. Tarantino is a master of escapist entertainment and if you're ready to take a ride away from the real world, his cinema is capable of making you feel like a kid again (meaning you are definitely NOT a child watching this film).",

Every time Tarantino releases a movie, people get up in arms about how violent, irresponsible, etc., etc. it is, for some reason holding him to task for \"violence in our media\" when the makers of the James Bond movies, Bourne movies and other such violent fare get off scot free.And while I still don't think Tarantino, his movies, or movies in general for that matter should be held responsible for violence carried out by people living in the real world, like it or not what is happening in the real world has an impact on how I respond to movies. That may be why I nearly reviled Tarantino's latest, \"Django Unchained,\" a throwback to the bloody spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone and his ilk.Tarantino is always recycling old genres, and I think enjoyment of his movies frequently depends on how much you enjoy the genre he's playing off of. I don't happen to like westerns very much, so that may be partly why I was unable to warm to this film. But I think that's only a small part of my reaction. Mostly, I felt for the first time that Tarantino was making a juvenile film, wasting his considerable talents on violence as pornography. In other Tarantino films, violence has been beside the point -- the films themselves have been violent, but the violence has been what happens in between the moments when we are learning about his characters and enjoying a story well told. In \"Django,\" violence IS the point. It's about the horrible, degrading things human beings do to each other, and our protagonist is a blank slate of a character with a one-word motivation: REVENGE. Revenge as a primary motive is boring unless the character seeking revenge is interesting, and Jamie Foxx isn't a talented enough actor, nor Django a fully-enough realized character, to make it interesting. The only person who makes the film worth watching is Christoph Waltz as a ruthless bounty hunter. He's so good in his role that the film fiercely misses his absence once he's out of the picture; unfortunately, the film goes on for another 30 minutes or so after Waltz exits.The final hour or so of this movie exists in my head as a vague blur of stomach-churning devastation. The bullets, blood and bodies fly, and while I appreciate Tarantino's determination to show us what happens to a human head when you shoot it with a shotgun (which is far more than most violent movies do), I had about as much fun watching it as I would an autopsy or a car accident.I live in Chicago, where the news reports contain a daily body count of the people shot in the city overnight, usually crimes motivated by revenge. And elsewhere, we've been recently inundated with news of slaughters and shootings around the country, crazy people who perceive that they've been wronged in some way taking out their fury on those who had nothing to do with it. When this kind of casual human carnage is so tragically real, as we are reminded on a daily basis, a movie that revels in it feels tacky as well as pointless.Time to grow up Quentin and start making movies for adults.Grade: C",

He has come out with another film which is now tied with End Of Watch as being the best film of the year. Now I don't have to like everything Quentin Tarantino but every thing I have seen of him but I have seen everything he has done and they are all fantastic including this one.The film starts in 1858, 2 years before the civil war, with Dr. King Schultz played by Christoph Waltz who comes across a group of slaves and requires the help of one. That happens to be Django played by Jamie Foxx. Shultz is a bounty hunter and needs the help of Django to find The Brittle Brothers who had kidnapped Django's wife and took her away. They soon find and kill The Britlle Brothers(Not a spoiler because this happens 40 minutes into the movie) and find out that Django's Wife Broomhilda played by Kerry Washington has been taken to a plantation known as Candyland run by Calvin Candie played by Leonardo DiCaprio.Calvin and Shultz negotiate at dinner the selling of a slave fighter but Calvin's assistant Stephen played by Samuel L. Jackson notices that Django and Broomhilda seem to know each other. Calvin then sells Broomhilda to Shultz and Django after threatening to kill Broomhilda. (Spoilers Ahead. Skip to the next paragraph if you have not seen this film which shame on you, you should see it.) Shultz then shoots and kills Candie after Candie's behavior and then a brutal and bloody shootout which results in the death of Schultz. Django Then ,with Broomhilda, go back to the plantation and kill the remaining betrayers and blows Calvins house to smithereens as Django and Broomhilda Ride off into the night.There is a scene in Django Unchained Where Django executes a bloody shootout and when I say Bloody, I mean so gruesome that I am surprised that this got away with an R Rating but I am glad it did so I could see it. This shooting is not realistic but it is so good and a pivotal scene in the film and it is awesome.The film has great acting. I hope Jamie Foxx gets nominated for Best Actor and not 1, but 3 people going for Best Supporting Actor, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. Kerry Washington for best Actress. Everybody in this film does a great job and this is some of the best acting I have seen in a film.The music is fantastic with the original Django theme in the opening credits. While I really do not like, sorry, hate rap, I think the rap music fits very well into the film. The theme of Spaghetti Western music is great.The story is awesome. I love the time period it is set in and it shows you a movie can be good if it is not set in modern times or in the future. The film also has beautiful set locations and Tarantino did a fantastic job recreating a western location.A warning to the squeamish, this film has harsh usage of the N word, although it is scary for the time period this film is set in, and has a ton of blood and is very gruesome. If you do not like the sight of that then you might want to sit this film out but do not let that stop you from seeing this film.I am introducing a new thing called The Drinking Game where you take a drink every time something repetitive happens, although thats not bad for this film.. Take a drink Whenever some uses the N word(121 times).The final verdict for Django Unchained is 4 Out Of 4 Stars with My Seal Of Approval. Awesome story and acting, great music, nice set locations and stylized glorified violence with great character development. See this film do whatever you can to see this movie. This movie may be 3 hours long but is entertaining every single second. Although do not take a 9 year old to see it. Thats what happened at my theater.Rated R For Strong Graphic Violence Throughout, A Vicious Fight, Language And Some Nudity.2hrs 45min/165min.39 uses of the F-word.121 uses of the N-word.****/****",

The story is interesting, the movie is way too gore at first I liked the movie then after all those disgusting scenes I thought, OK i'm definitely not re watching this movie again, and after 1.30h of the movie I was \"damned this movie is getting boring, oh no wait another disgusting gore scene, and another rap song, well done Tarantino you now have the attention of the 17years old that are going to talk about how gore it was at school\"But lets not be too negative I didn't rate this movie with a 0 because the photography was really amazing, the shots were really beautiful, the story is catchy, some of the actors are really good good overall costumes. This movie has many reference to other movies so if you are a movie fan you might recognise some moments from other movies. But the overall feeling of the movie isn't very good in my opinion, it could have been an amazing movie he had all the good cards in his hand to make this movie epic but it will definitely not be one for me.

            "content": "All the charm of \"Django\" is not in excellent stylistics, meticulous script and not in the first-class game and selection of actors. The director and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino is at the heart of this tangle of coolness, so you should start promoting this work with him.Tarantino, like his character, dropped the shackles of genres, difficulties in perceiving the fresh works and focused on what he loves and knows best - the 'spaghetti western'. At first glance, the genre is as simple as a gingerbread, water everything with ketchup and eat with actors, however, only Tarantino and one more person today can separately shoot spaghetti westerns and \"thrash\" without confuse these concepts. With all the comedy, blood and conventionality, Quentin draws within a single canvas of realistic slavery, realistic people, realistic love and in general digs traditionally deeper than you expect.With the hero of the day Tarantino all around his finger. Jamie Fox and Leonardo Dicaprio are as good as you can expect from them in this situation and even more. But the script is written, first of all, to Christoph Valz and with his participation in a painstaking process; he is the king here, he is the central character, this is his benefit. His talent creates once again such things that the film wants to be revised in any way. For this purpose, by the way, from 2013 distributors will start showing original movie tracks with subtitles in cinemas (in addition to dubbing), which will be very valuable for many.On this \"German\" element of the picture is not exhausted. Firstly, Django became a cult and found popularity in the 60's not only in America, but also around the world and especially on German soil. In their edges, as we have now, sometimes during localization they put the name \"Django\" in the name of films without any reason, simply because \"also spaghetti western\". Secondly, the story of a liberated slave and his beloved echoes the myth of Siegfried and Brunnhilde, the good thing is that the latter is called that. From all this symbolism, which Tarantino already has enough, comes legendary at all levels.Thanks to the dialogues, personal skills and plus all the make-up artists' work, the images of most of the secondary characters will be remembered, especially Samuel L. Jackson (the role of the bad grandfather was obviously successful) and the cowboy Don Johnson.And what happens to the music in \"Django\"! The viewer is satisfied with a roller coaster of the epochs, Morricone starts, modern performers like John Ledgend continue, and Jerry Goldsmith, a classic, completes the ride. The selection is so diverse that it seems as if Tarantino wanted to please everyone. And he managed to do it.",

'Django Unchained' is, once again, a dazzling display of craftsmanship, boldness and originality. And, above all, it has this quite unique QT-touch of not taking anything too seriously. A lot of it is completely over the top, and that's exactly why it's so much fun to watch. At the same time, Tarantino doesn't make it easy for himself. The subject of slave-trading and race relations in general is sensitive. But once again, not taking yourself too seriously does the trick. Only Tarantino can pull off a scene where Samuel L. Jackson tells Leonardo Di Caprio he doesn't want a 'ni**er' like Jamie Foxx in the house. The acting in 'Django Unchained' is superb. I particularly liked Christoph Waltz as a slick gentleman bounty hunter who can talk his way out of (almost) every situation. He is extremely polite and at the same time extremely violent. Leonardo Di Caprio is also excellent as a sadistic plantation owner - supposedly the first time he plays a villain. And there is the trademark Tarantino dialogue. Witty, funny, and sometimes absurd: when one bounty hunter asks the other if he's positive that the man they're going to shoot is really the one they're looking for, it turns out he doesn't understand the meaning of the word positive. I've enjoyed watching this film from beginning to end. There are hardly any weak moments or unbalanced scenes. No one in the film business does what Tarantino does. And that's why each QT-film is a sensation. 'Django Unchained' is no exception.",

It shows the brutality and absurdity of racists, and while the film is set in 1858, its message applies to modern society. Leonardo DiCaprio beautifully illustrates the pseudo-intellectual who regards himself as a member of a master race, only he happens to live in a world where such notions are widely accepted.True to Quentin Tarantino's style, the film contains a lot of empty space with beautiful shots and casual dialog. These are interspersed with gory, explicit scenes of extreme violence. Like in Kill Bill, the violence is of the comic book variety -- unrealistic and fun even when it's obvious that the victims are in pain. There are also a couple of scenes that contain truly horrifying cruelty, but mostly Tarantino's intention is to make his audience laugh. Look for the scene where Lara the Southern Belle is pulled back from the doorway with an invisible string!The scenes are not as drawn-out as in Inglorious Basterds, and the strongest tension is rather early in the film. The dialog is a little more to the point, which some Tarantino fans dislike. Christoph Waltz acts with professional skill. Jamie Foxx's Django is a traditional quiet Western hero. As usual, DiCaprio steals the show in the scenes where he is present. The soundtrack shines bright, including obscure 70's songs, Ennio Morricone and even rap music, which is somewhat thematically appropriate.",

Heck, you might want to think twice about letting them see a second of this movie, what with all the blood and guts and colorful language. But putting that aside, as we must, Django Unchained is clearly one of the best movies of 2012, even one of the very best of Quentin Tarantino's strong career.It's the antebellum South, and blacks and bought and sold like cattle. One of them, the titular Django, is being led through a thick forest, chained to several other male slaves, when a German dentist, a Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) frees him, slaying his captors and bidding the remaining slaves a fond adieu. Schultz's plan is simple. He is actually a bounty hunter, and he is on the trail of three men wanted for murder and train robbery. He has discovered that Django knows the men on sight, and Schultz himself does not. Thus he deputizes the still-technically-a- slave Django to help him find the three baddies; if Django can point out the men, Schultz will grant him his freedom. Their trek takes them to the plantation of one Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), who's pretty vicious even by slaveholder standards. Schultz and Django pose as a duo who wish to purchase a mandingo fighter, with Django - as a free man - the proclaimed expert on such fighters. You see, Schultz and Django have an ulterior motive - they wish to find Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who was sold separately from Django, and they have reason to believe she resides with Candie.As bullets fly and flecks and spurts of blood practically pirouette in the air, one can easily appreciate the majesty of the art of film. Yes, that's an over-the-top sentiment, but it doesn't apply to many movies. Quentin Tarantino is famed for trying to get just the right shot, much like Stanley Kubrick before him. There's a certain poetic symmetry to every cocked pistol, every framed desert background, every lash of a terrifying whip. This is a brutal film to watch, and it is unflinching in its depiction of the true evil of slavery. The domination of fellow man was bad enough, but the physical and ultimately psychological terrorism defies description. It was not a proud moment in our country's history.But we in the 21st century know all about that, and this film is not simply about the brutality of man versus man. Believe it or not, it is a love story and the lengths to which a man will go, the horrors that he will endure, to be reunited with his beloved. Foxx is astonishing as Django, who's played not as an overzealous vengeful machine but rather a taciturn, intelligent, multilayered man among men. Schultz, his conniving compatriot, is every bit as compelling as he was in Tarantino's earlier Inglourious Basterds; crisp, wise, always many steps ahead of his foe. DiCaprio is (surprisingly) convincing as the menacing, degenerate Candie. At one point, Candie rhetorically asks why, as he is always surrounded by black folks, none of them rise up to kill him; I wondered why there were no white women around him at all, save for his sister, whom he mouth kisses, but maybe that was just mere coincidence. I digress. Samuel L. Jackson turns up as the head black man on campus who serves his master well - but is he more Luke Skywalker or more Darth Vader? He's also almost unrecognizable playing a old, cane-leaning codger with the mouth of a sailor and the crusty sentimentality of the worst grandfather ever. It's a good role for him.I did mention this is one heck of a bloody movie, right? You've heard of Quentin Tarantino, right? Okay, then. If you dislike gory stuff, stay away. This is an homage to the old spaghetti Westerns of the past, although Tarantino himself refers to this one as a Southern, seeing as how it takes place mostly in the Deep South. That means confrontations with sheriffs, marshals, bandits, and other colorful - pardon the bad pun - people. It is not a pretty, romanticized ode to the West. It is a mean time filled with vile behavior, and of this comes the love of two.Now comes the raving part, or at least more of it. I loved this movie. Thought it was terrific from start to finish. Some twists, all plausible. And you should see the cast list - a who's who of who is that? Don Johnson? Tom Wopat? Franco Nero? Russ Tamblyn and his daughter Amber? I love Tarantino's casting. Not to gush, but it's always nice to see a director who appreciates cinema's long history. Add the attention to detail, the courage to show some grisly scenes that could cause one to look away in horror, and you have a rumbling roar of a movie.",

The highlight for me, however, is without a doubt Christoph Waltz, he plays this character so naturally and with so much heart, earning his second Academy Award win for this movie, he truly steals the show.It is a very long running time at almost three hours,you would certainly have to be in the mood for it before you start watching. I did feel that a weak point of the movie was that some scenes were just unnecessary and way too long. The dinner scene goes on forever, this is necessary but it did not have to feel like 50% of the film. Other scenes, like the one with the KKK, were overlong and just did not seem needed at all. They were well executed and well acted parts, but I just felt like they took the audience out of the story too much. Well acted and superbly written, Django Unchained will surely withstand the test of time and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good western or fans of Tarantino films.

After a series of violent adventures involving spouts of blood and gobs of gore, the pair ends up at \"Candieland,\" the Mississippi plantation of Mr. Calvin Candie (played with volcanic gusto by Leonardo DiCaprio) wherein dwells the captive wife of Django, a pretty slave girl (Kerry Washington) named \"Broomhilde\" because her former mistress had been German and had taught her the language so she would have someone to talk to. The mission: to trick Candie into selling Broomhilde to them so they can spirit her away to safety. As soon as the Candieland sequence gets going, \"Django Unchained\" becomes a fully accomplished, if excessively violent, film. Tarantino, as always, knows how to grip the audience with expert camera-work, gutsy performances and clever dialogue. DiCaprio is more compelling than he has been in any film since \"Gilbert Grape\" nearly 20 years ago. His pudgy boyishness, enhanced by blackened teeth, serves to convey corruption and vileness. Samuel L. Jackson in extreme \"Uncle Ben\"-house-slave mode is a revelation. What vast reserves of talent this man has. He steals every scene he is in, which is a mighty tall order with a cast like this. He is aided by a knowing script that explores the complexities of the long-term master-slave relationship. The way Tarantino ends the film punctuates this relationship superbly. The interactions between him and DiCaprio are sublime.The movie is filled with typical Tarantino curlicues, the German-language angle with the Kerry Washington character being one of them. Some of Tarantino's trademark humorous banter against the backdrop of extreme violence, particularly the complaints of Klan riders about the fit of their hoods, goes on far too long, and the adventures of the central figures finally take on a repetitious \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" serial quality. Twenty minutes of this type of filler could have been easily cut. And this is the problem with the film. It goes nowhere that Tarantino hasn't been before. But he does manage to make us feel something of the terror and dehumanization that prevailed in those bygone days. A scene in which a pack of ravenous dogs is set upon an escaped slave is as unwatchably horrific as anything on screens anywhere.",

With Django Unchained, the writer/director has crafted a piece of storytelling that's both violent and poignant; here, though, the violence isn't glorified in quite the same way it has been in the past.The year is 1858\u2014\"Two Years Before the Civil War\" as the opening titles tell us\u2014and the slavery-plantation infrastructure is at the height of its dominance in the southern U.S. Also woven into this backdrop is the prominence of bounty hunters; individuals contracted by U.S. Marshals to apprehend\u2014dead or alive\u2014outlaws who quickly ventured out of their respective jurisdictions. One such mercenary is the German-born Dr. King Schultz (Waltz). He possesses a refined viciousness, but he makes no bones about his contempt for slavery. In an attempt to locate a trio of bandits that have changed names and relocated to another part of the country, Schultz enlists the help of Django (Foxx), a slave who has seen the gang in person and can identify them on sight. We quickly learn that there's more to Django than meets the eye. The man was separated from his wive via the slave trade some time prior, and will do anything and everything to free her. Thus the two enter into a partnership which sees them carving a path of carnage through each of the slave states between Texas and Tennessee.It's a relatively straightforward tale of love and revenge (really, are Tarantino movies ever anything else?), and blood is spilled by the gallon every time a bullet is sent flying through an unsuspecting foe. As previously mentioned, however, there's the pressing message that violence begets violence; an especially brutal scene sees a runaway slave get ripped apart by a pack of ravenous dogs. As the grisly scenario plays out, Schultz shies away in disgust, visibly shaken by the spectacle. In fact, he's haunted by this for the remainder of the film, and it greatly influences his actions near the climax. This, I think, is where Django works best; though nauseating, it's clear that Tarantino and company were determined to foster an accurate sense of how horrific the atrocities of slavery really were. And when it comes to airbrushing history, it's clear that Tarantino absolutely refuses to tone things down.The stylistic flair that's defined virtually every Tarantino outing is present here too, and it distinguishes the film in much the same way. Unusual\u2014and humorous\u2014music is cued at just the right moment, and the dialogue is every bit as crisp as you'd expect.The acting is spectacular as well. Of particular note is the portrayal of Calvin Candie (DiCaprio). Candie is the owner of \"Candie Land,\" one of the most feared plantations in the country, and the final destination of our protagonists as they work through their bounties in an effort to reunite Django with his betrothed. Candie is a ruthless slave owner who has an incendiary desire to inflict suffering on the residents of his property, and there's a subdued brand of rage that DiCaprio is able to bring to the role. Waltz and Foxx are, of course, formidable actors, but DiCaprio steals the show in the latter half of the movie, and, like Waltz in Basterds, he becomes the villain that we love to hate. Samuel L. Jackson is also memorable as Steven, the right-hand man (and long time slave) of Candie.If I have any criticisms of the movie it comes in the form of the revenge bits. Though completely expected, there's an early perception that Django and Schultz are both burdened by the sense that so much killing will result in a continually growing burden that will eventually accumulate into something entirely crushing. Having these characters attempt to hash this out would have been a welcome addition; in my mind, it would have been something that separated the film from all of Tarantino's previous movies. It would have demonstrated an even deeper sense of maturity than any of us would have expected. In many ways, I kept waiting for Tarantino to transcend\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014 himself. This never truly happens, and it's a tad bit disappointing.That said, Django Unchained delivers in virtually every way. It's well- written, brilliantly directed, engrossing, and, (perhaps) most importantly, laced with moments of welcome seriousness.",

Third Jamie Fox just ruins it.That was the whole review I had to say but I need to make up for the lines.Then the movie was way longer than it should of been.The movie could of been good I mean the story itself was fine, the cheap humor ruined it. And a better main character could of been put in instead Jamie Fox.Also the movie seems like they tried to hard to make it fair play for white and black men. Like if whites are bad then they are bad, they tried me make it look like whites are bad at first and then blacks made jokes about them. Thats lame. If you wanna use so much terms like \" the N word \" in the show, do it balls out. Don't have one cruel scene and try to soften it with some black people killing the white guy in exchange. Man up to your proposition. But long story short, the movie was ruined with tons of cheap try hard humor.Don't get fooled by the cover, the cover looks great the movie is far from it. Its not a horrible movie but its not deserving of a nice cover like that. The movie is NOT nearly as cool as the cover.",

It is a good movie.I had heard so many people say this film was the best Tarantino film they had seen... I disagree. It is nowhere near in the same league as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs.The film is about a bounty hunter who is looking for his latest bounty. He does not know what they look like so he finds Django. He knows that Django knows what they look like. Django is a slave. But when the bounty hunter sees what talent Django has, he makes him a deal... If he frees Django and Django helps him hunt, the bounty hunter will help him find his wife and free her too.The films stars Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio & Samuel L. Jackson. Everyone does a great job... they were all believable in their roles.This film is set back in the day when slaves were legal. It was such a racist time and you can really tell when watching this.There is the typical amount of violence for a Quentin Tarantino movie... but I love that. It would not be a Tarantino film unless there was a decent about of blood.The film is quite long... it is on for 2 hours 45 minutes... but I didn't mind in this film as it was entertaining from beginning to end.My favourite character was Stephen who was played by Samuel L. Jackson. He played the part so well that I hated him. I hated DiCaprio too... but Jackson did an outstanding performance.The other great thing was the brilliant little appearance from Quentin Tarantino himself. I am glad he was in the movie... i think it really cements a Tarantino film.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Again Tarantino delivers another great movie.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",

Dajngo is similar to Inglorious Bastards with over the top violence, surprise killings of characters, and plot twists. Tarantino uses some historical research then changes history! Django has several characters tell their sub-stories into making one big story. Waltz out shines Di Caprio and Foxx in Django as the showman, and mechanical bounty hunter. One learns even Waltz's character even has limits. Di Caprio's character loves his power at the plantation, and the game man ship with Waltz. Foxx is the man on a mission trying to find his lady. The surprise acting performance on par with Waltz is Jackson's. The surprise is how much a impact Jackson had with a small roll. Jackson was (behind Di Caprio) the second most powerful man at the plantation for he knew from the inside how and what the other slaves where planning. Jackson's character loved his power and a few of his comments gave Jackson the same power of a political adviser. Django, like Bastards, ends in a Tarantino style revenge flick, with all the gore too. I give Django an eight out of ten.",

            "content": "Django Unchained isn't Tarantino's most consistent work nor is it his best, it is however, still a truly great spectacle.The film initially focuses on Dr Schultz (Waltz) who is a skilled and charismatic bounty hunter. The good doctor soon enlists the help of a hopeless slave called Django (Foxx) who crucially can identify conclusively the men currently on Schultz's kill list. Shultz who is sympathetic to the black slaves of the deep south despite his own morally corrupt profession, soon sees the potential and merit in having Django around. Then the focus shifts as we learn that Django has been separated from his wife and the odd pair endeavour to rescue her from a plantation run by the eccentric and possibly psychotic Candie (DiCaprio).I'll start by stating the obvious, Tarantino is a Cinephile. This often works to his advantage but every so often its a hindrance, Django represents a good case to highlight this. Django's opening two acts are very strong, focusing on character and setting, providing us with a rich and inviting world that is equal parts grim and hilarious. However, much like Tarantino's more recent efforts Inglorious Basterds and Kill Bill, Django suffers from an odd and inconsistent tone. When the film is funny, it is very funny. When it is sad, it is truly heartbreaking (see all of the numerous torture scenes). However, when the shoot-outs and action began, by and large i switched off. The violence here is campy (as are most of the performances) but there is an odd cinematic grandiosity that simply isn't present in much of the rest of the film. It is strange to focus so much on character and development to dispel it so whimsically with a series spurts and loud bangs. Its mainly the last act that is afflicted with this problem, bullets fly and blood is spilt but the films bite and feeling gets lost in the m\u00eal\u00e9e. Django himself soon becomes a caricature, he becomes the movie equivalent of what his character sets out to be at the start of the movie and this is a shame. Thus, the last 45 minutes is shade too light and throwaway, seemingly at odds with the world Tarantino painted with his first hour and 45 minutes.The above being said the film is still masterfully crafted. Everything from the tawdry vernacular (i wont comment on the rights and wrongs use of the N word), to the costume design right through to the performances are simply sublime. Waltz, Foxx and DiCaprio are all great as the various shades of humanity on parade but its Waltz who again steals the show. His charming, effervescent musings mixed with his unwavering empathy make Schultz a force of nature from his brash entrance to his heroic exit in the film. All of the Tarantino-isms are present, the fluid use of time, witty villainous monologuing, extreme violence and an expert use of cinema language. Tarantino shuffles his deck like few can and once again shows why he is a true original. Most films struggle to nail down one mode or tone and Tarantino valiantly tries (with varying success) to juggle a plethora of moods with an intelligence and arrogance few can match. Case in point is the films tongue in cheek seriousness, even in the face of Django's vengeful retribution the film isn't afraid to jolt straight back into farce with the wink of an eye.It might be a little long for some and it could have been wrapped up more cleanly but hey, thats just not the Tarantino way. I think a more straight forward, more succinct ending would have been more effective than the one offered here but Tarantino is much more comfortable being subversive and revelling is his ever colouful, lovingly created pastiches. So in short, this is an often great but ultimately solid piece of cinema and yet another interesting chapter in the already bulging book of Quentin Tarantino.",

            "review_title": "Tarantino is as fond of talking as ever",
            "content": "I suppose it's fairer to say \"fond of dialogues\" as the critics put it, but with Tarantino, the dialogue is really the screenwriter talking out aloud, his own monologue, so to speak. So, let's not split hair. The first thing you'll notice about \"Django\" is that it is probably the most main-stream Tarantino that has hit the market. Except for a few flashbacks (of which you'll likely see more in other mainstream movies), the story-telling is uncharacteristically linear, completely devoid of the auteur's trademark convolutions. The expected brutality and bloodbaths are still there (indeed, without them, it wouldn't be Tarantino) but somewhat toned down compared with his earlier works. But thank heaven, the delightful caustic (and on occasions outlandish) humor is still there, intact. And, of course, the dialogue. Emerging from this 165 minute superb entertainment, I had a thought that it could very well use the \"chapters\" format as in many other movies, most notably of which, say, \"The sting\". But there is nothing wrong in not having that. Simply put, this is the story of a series of adventures of two bounty hunters. In the prelude, Doctor Schultz (Christoph Waltz), ethnic German bounty hunter working with the cover identity of a traveling dentist, seeks out Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave in-transportation and, failing in an attempt to buy him, shoots the slave traders and takes him anyway. The first chapter establishes the relationship between the pair: Schultz needs Django to identify the target of a lucrative assignment, three brothers wanted \"dead or alive\", which turns out to be the terms of reference for almost all of his assignments. Schultz is quickly established as a \"good guy\", sadistic and ruthless notwithstanding, offering Django freedom and a share of the bounty money, as well as the horse they took from the slave trader. Django, as it turns out, doesn't need any lure because the three villains were the ones who captured, tortured and branded him and his wife Broomhilder (Kerry Washington). This first chapter also gives a little demonstration of the good doctor at work, coming to a small town and shooting down the sheriff who turns out to be a \"wanted\" criminal in hiding. This small job only paid him two hundred dollars but does give Django a feel for the profession. Quite predictably (I use this word in a neutral manner; we all know that if Tarantino wants, he can be as unpredictable as any director, dead or alive). The next chapter is an account of how this job is accomplished. Quite significantly, this time Django kills two of the targets, leaving only one for Schultz to handle, which he doesn't mind. You can consider the next sequence a separate chapter, continuation of the same chapter, or some sort of interlude. Schultz takes on Django as a partner and gives him good training. The two working together accumulate a considerable fortune, as well as develop a brotherhood bonding. The final chapter is the longest, occupying maybe as much as half of the movie, taking its good time to develop how the pair plans to rescue Broomhilder from arch-villain plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) to whom she has been sold. The whole thing starts like \"The sting\" and ends like \"Kill Bill\". More I will not reveal. That is the plot and story. As to the heart and soul, it is also quite straightforward: a manifestation against slavery or, more specifically, black slavery in the US. One prominent critic, half-seriously, suggests a double feature of \"Django\" together with \"Lincoln\" (and the two add up to 17 Oscar nominations), and that is a good way of putting it. One thing that really captures my attention is the development of Django the person, both mentally and physically, throughout the movie. At the start, he is a lowly, taciturn slave. Throughout his association with Schultz, he develops such self-confidence and character that at the end, he is not unlike one of those Western heroes usually played by John Wayne (except in skin color). Tarantino has also given meticulous attention to details, anticipating the audience's likely question \"How come a slave can shoot like John Wayne?\" Tarantino first shows in an early scene how Schultz offers Django a rifle to get a feel of shooting at one of the rascals on horseback. While Schultz gets impatient, Django aims unhurriedly, and gets his man just before he disappears into the wood. Schultz is obviously impressed, \"You are a natural!\" Later, there is a brief scene of Django practicing shooting under Schultz's guidance. At the very end of the movie, after we have seen everything, there is a coda of a cryptic flashback to the earlier training scenes, with Schultz saying to Django \"You are becoming the fastest gun in the South\". Talking about fast draw, I notice two scenes which might have been tributes to \"The magnificent seven\". One is at the \"prelude\", when Schultz draws with lightning speed against the slave traders just the way Yul Brynner did at the graveyard entrance when he is blocked (although he didn't kill). The other is the long shot Schultz had on the last of the wanted brothers trying to get away on horseback, which reminds me of James Coburn's long shot (although again with a small difference as Coburn \"was aiming at the horse\"). Waltz has already won Golden Globe and I won't be surprised if he also gets his second Oscar. You would enjoy watching DiCaprio, delicious vile in his portrayal. Foxx is always dependable and handles extremely wellthe character development I mentioned. Washington's role as damsel-in-distress here is not as demanding as Della Bea Robinson in \"Ray\" (the film with which Foxx won his Oscar), and her performance here is solidly dependable. The one to really watch is Samuel L. Jackson as Cabdie's right-hand man. He really deserves a Golden Globe nomination alongside with Waltz and DiCarpio.",

            "content": "Mel Brooks comedy classic \"Blazing Saddles\" was the first thing that came to mind while watching \"Django Unchained\".And I'm obviously not alone in that. I read the screenplay beforehand, and aside from a couple of scenes, the comedic touch wasn't that evident. Thankfully Tarantino cut out a number of very vile rape-scenes, whose omission do nothing to soften the grueling and abhorrent behavior that shows man's cruelty towards man in all its gory-glory.The movie is too long for my taste. The last third could've been cut shorter, and some earlier scenes run on a bit too long. But aside from that, the script is tight, the art- and camera-work superb and the performances are spellbinding. There is not one loose chink in the ensemble chain. Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx have an unusual chemistry together, which is most evident in a very brief sequence where Django throws back the morals of his bounty hunting liberator Dr. King Schultz, and we make a first big step towards ambivalence. The other pairing is that of Samuel L. Jackson and Leonardo DiCaprio. The former playing a black servant with the demeanor of a pure blooded white racist, and the latter presents himself as the most educated, tasteful and wealthy form of fascist ideologue with a scientific predilection. Tarantino does have a profound sympathy for the devil.Equally strong and mostly omitted in the reviews is the couple in distress. Foxx and the beautiful Kerry Washington fashion a whole romance out of very little cloth, and are seen only briefly together. Yet, their marriage and the reasons for Djangos journey are obvious and never simply implied. These two truly love each other.Nothing is as serious as comedy, and nothing as funny as dying. What \"Django Unchained\" does, next to inciting a long awaited discussion on the slavery past of the United States, freed from political correctness, is entertain and shock in equal measures. And it makes you actually wish for a straightforward comedy written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Now that would be a truly blazing saddle.",

            "content": "I'm not qualified to comment on the historical authenticity of Quentin Tarantino's fully committed depiction of black American slavery in 1858 but I'm as qualified as anyone else to share with you why I, personally, think this is another significant contribution to one of the greatest movie directing careers of all time.With Django (the D's silent you know) Tarantino cements his position in the top 10.This is epic, just as Kill Bill (1 and 2) was, and proves that long movies don't have to be padded out indulgences. It grows in its impact with every scene and ends up a classic.Spike Lee has problems with the depiction of slavery and I have to respect that as I, like Tarantino, am Caucasian. At times it does seem to mock the plight of America's black slaves but I feel sure that Samuel L Jackson (virtually unrecognisable) and Jamie Foxx saw more than a wage in choosing to star in it and I'm sure too that the judges of the Black Reel Awards which have given it six nominations are qualified to judge it on its merits as opposed to its politics.Although described as a (spaghetti) western this is really a movie about slavery and not since 'Roots' has African American slavery been so prominently featured on screen. Tarantino does not shy away from the subject matter or the vernacular of the time. \"Nigger\" is used over 100 times in the script and not just by the slaves. I had to refer to my copy of Filthy English: The How, Where, When and What of Everyday Swearing by Pete Silverton to establish whether or not MotherF@\u00a3$%er was currency in 1858 but there is evidence that points to its validity. Just as well, because Samuel L J can't really get through a movie without saying it repeatedly and he does so again, liberally.There's an early scene in which predecessors of the Ku Klux Klan hunt down Jamie Foxx, the freed slave and \"black man on a horse!\" who is bounty hunting with ex Dentist, Dr King Schultz (played entirely idiosyncratically by Christoph Waltz), their depiction is so funny that one has to question whether or not it's really acceptable to laugh so uproariously at a subject matter so taboo; but that's Tarantino's gift. It's also his gift to spoof genres, mock convention (and history) mount lavish killing sprees and generally have a grand old time no matter the subject matter and that's why we love him so.Django is great fun, some say it's too long but for me the movie simply got itself into a place (a little slowly I'd say) that fans of Tarantino would want to stay for hours.Leonardo Di Caprio has not been this good since The Departed, (strangely not an Oscar nomination) and Jamie Foxx acquits himself well in a low-key, black Eastwood type performance. But it's Waltz that dominates in the acting stakes and his Oscar nod is fair reward. There's only one Chrisoph Waltz that's for sure (and there's plenty of it if you care to look \u2013 101 acting roles to date to be precise.) So, a little flawed (the start fails to quickly engage in gear) but unique and brilliant. Go see it and forget the politics. It's a movie.",

He's constantly being a smart Alec, which may amuse some people. Even in the face of danger, he's cracking jokes and being a wise guy in front of someone's gun barrel. Is this a bad comedy, or a movie about a slave going up against all odds?Then you have the actual action. I could swallow some of the Rambo stuff that was happening if the movie didn't start off pretending to be realistic. The movie is so pretentious, and I bet some people somehow consider this above your typical Steven Seagal movie.And of course, most white people in this movie are demonized, and in many cases killed in a what is supposed to be comedic fashion. Never mind the fact that not all white folks necessarily agree with slavery that is going on and are simply forced to go along with the culture of their time.I guess my mistake was expecting a more serious and realistic movie. Had I know this would turn into some bad over-the-top revenge movie, I wouldn't have bothered.There were some positive notes here. The scenery and the music were nice, but that's pretty much it.

Black is the new white. In my new movie, I play a slave. How black is that? I have to wear chains. How whack is that? I get free. I save my wife, and I kill all the white people in the movie. How great is that? And how black is that?\"The crowd erupted in laughter, whooping, and applause.To the other reviewers, I have this to say: Whites have grievances too, not the least of which is being turned into a minority in our own country by trickery and coercion, forced racial busing, as well as non-white quotas, refugee resettlement, affirmative action for immigrants, blacklists of paleoconservatives, and 30 years of censorship of those who oppose the Left's anti-white policies.

Its also cool to see Tarintinos style added to a western. A Genre in much need off a boost.Trouble is a lot off stuff that's been done here, Tarintino has done before, and better. Christoph Waltz, who's up for all sorts off awards because off this, was better in \"Inglorious bastards\" I thought, which he rightfully won them for. The Film also didn't have too be as long as it is. Its as if Tarintinos trademarks had to be all firmly in place, but the 3 hour running time is something I could off done without this time round.

            "content": "'Django Unchained' is an unusually literate outing at the movies based on sound storytelling and carefully cultivated and reticulated narrative pace. It lacks the warmhearted authenticity of the friendship between Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte in 'Buck and the Preacher' and has slightly less of the macho swagger of Mario Van Peebles' 'Posse'. But that notwithstanding, it does have something these two noted films lack.That is a good white person. The kind of good white person whose absence was so conspicuous in Spike Lee's 'Malcolm X'.The lead character Django meets a bounty hunter of dubious values who yet and still as a character is slightly more developed and intriguing than even Django himself. He mentors and guides Django in the art of killing for money and once Django acquires the requisite skills, Freedom beckons on the horizon like bright sunshine. Together they cook up a plan to rescue Django's wife from the evil castle in Candyland.So far so good.Earlier, I mentioned how it might be enlightening to compare this film with 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'. I still consider this a valid and valuable suggestion. Slavery is such an emotionally charged subject that it is easy to forget that many countless whites have advocated, agitated and even gone as far as to sacrifice their own well-being and even lives for the liberation of those kidnapped from Africa. For, commercial purposes, it is much easier to label whites as the bad guys and blacks as the good guys and play upon the latent resentments and anger of an audience that has been used to viewing itself in less than flattering and often downright demeaning ways.This film, to its credit, does not do that. It's characters are as complex as those in the original Western '3:10 to Yuma'. Unfortunately, with the exception of Broomhilda, Django's wife, they are not as sympathetic.The characters in 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' are sympathetic. Nobody could ever represent poor, redneck, hillbilly white trash better than the homely rail-splitter from Illinois and Kentucky who somehow pulled himself up by his bootstraps reading Euclid and Law books in the fields and the General store until, for whatever reasons, he finally gave his life to end slavery and preserve the Union. When you see Mary Lincoln hiking with Harriet Tubman and runaway slaves to some destination in the North, it rings emotionally true even though it probably never happened that way.'Django Unchained' has wit and intelligence; not to mention the usual uninhibited Tarantino abandon for ladling out the blood and guts a little too thick. While not exactly my cup of tea, (or should I say hot tomato soup?), it is easy to see how Tarantino has won the love of his legions of fans. But I have to admit I find his use of violence, bordering as it tends to on the pornographic, off-putting at times.",

Well, I am usually not much into the elements mentioned above. But I like Tarantino's works and I did not have to get disappointed, everything was in place: directing, dialogs, tensions, realistic cruelty... It strikes me that many consider this movie too violent; compared to other Tarantino's movies, proportion of violence/blood is rather small. And how the black music (e.g. rap) fits into riding scenes, wow! The ending scenes have also several levels, are versatile and sophisticated (apart from the very final scene, perhaps). As regards the cast, it is astonishing again, with several Academy Award winners and nominees. And again no dull characters, even the very supporting ones. In my opinion, the cream-of-the-cream performances are by Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz and by Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen, although all the others are great as well. Waltz is the only actor provided an actor Oscar for Tarantino and he has the opportunity to duplicate this year. Let's see, he has strong competitors.Django Unchained is great, however, I do still consider Pulp Fiction better / more conceptional. That is why \"only\" 9 points this time.

I tell this friend - \"The civil war is over and this is a film\" Yet he still says that it is anti - white and won't patronize it. I say to him - \"this is your loss\".Sure, there was a lot of use of the N word in this movie. But let's face it, this was a movie set in 1858 and the use of that word was not uncommon.

There were a few big names like Don Johnson and that guy from all those funny movies who is fat - that are in for just a few minutes. But let's face it, QT has the power to get whoever he wants! I just have to say that this movie was not a revenge movie of blacks against whites. The great actor Walton Goggins was amazing. He is from \"The Shield\" (another series my friend hates) and he accuses Michael Chickless of being a lime green shirt kind of a guy. I want everybody to see this movie. Spike Lee is voiding it because he feels slavery is not a subject to be made into a movie. I have one thing to say to Spike (who is a fool). See Roots!Thank you Mr. T, you have made my day.

That he hasn't made his \"Schindler's List\" yet. He's too much in his comfort zone, not stretching himself. A bit like Kevin Smith, they're both too content with the same old male-centric teenage fantasies featuring clever dialogue, violence or sexual crudeness and inter-connecting story lines. They both ignore the rules of film.Django does have some deeper themes though. And Tarantino manages to give this movie a positive kind of ambiguity. Is it completely tongue-in-cheek or is he trying to make a point here? Which parts are sincere? In any case, Django goes all the way which is the important thing. There is no holding back, no watering down. It's strange but captivating. Completely unbelievable but never distractingly stupid or unrealistic. You could accept that stranger stories have taken place.There are many similarities to the Kill Bill movies. Both are highly violent, epic tales of revenge. The main character starts off incapacitated, is disadvantaged by either race or gender but finally plans to track down and kill their antagonists. Women and black people can be heroes too, they can be deadly and powerful. The human spirit transcends cultural barriers.It is also similar to Inglorious Bastards in the way it builds unbearable tension. The way a villain plays with their victims, torturing them with lengthy, partially irrelevant monologues. And of course there is Christoph Waltz. He is very enjoyable as Dr. Schultz which suits his strengths as an actor perfectly. He is quirky, confident, intelligent and spontaneous. The way his character is introduced and then developed is very cool. He is such a polite and eccentric bad-ass.I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was brilliant in his role. He didn't hold back and he completely summons the audience's attention in every scene he's in. Normally a deranged, racist madman wouldn't make a particularly interesting bad guy. But here the menace is very real and he can't really be avoided in Django's mission. He is so delightfully, colourfully detestable. Many of his scenes are full of suspense, you don't know when he might flip out or just continue to be falsely gentlemanly. Samuel L. Jackson also brought a lot of intensity to the movie, mainly with his eyes but also with his voice and timing.Tarantino's cameo was hilarious, as was a lot of the movie overall. There is a lot of black humour (no pun intended). In fact, there are few scenes that don't have playful jokes and ideas within them somewhere. A scene about hoods was one of the funniest I think I've ever seen. Other very funny moments included seeing Django learn new words and wearing his personal choice of clothes.Tarantino seems to like turning genres on their head, playing with audience expectations, going to extremes just to get a reaction. But he does this as a huge fan of all kinds of movies, as an expert on affecting an audience in a certain way. It's not merely a gimmick, it's a powerful tool that very few film-makers know how to (or dare) to employ. And the bottom line is entertainment. Whether the audience is laughing, gasping, thinking, crying or some combination, they're entertained. Django Unchained was crazy, exhilarating, disturbing and highly fun.",

There is far too much violence against black people and Tarantino (a white man) wrote far too many n-words for it to be ok-we all remember when he cast himself in pulp fiction so he could say it then.As a piece of art? This movie is almost untouchable. The beautiful allegory to the tale of Siegfried and Wagner's Das Ring des Nibelungen, told through the lens of the pre-civil war south. The metaphors and parallels are relentless, and that's just the subtext. It has classic Tarantino dialogue, which creates some of the most intense and suspenseful scenes I've ever seen (before any guns even go off). The characters are beautifully realized and performed, the pacing is great (yes, even though it is almost 3 hours), and the music is a ton of fun. The cinematography and flashy camera work just adds to the spectacle of it! There are so many memorable lines and scenes, if it wasn't for all the n-bombs I'd quote this all day.Even though I've mentioned it already, the suspense is what makes this movie. Leo plays such a terrifying villain and Candyland feels like the pit of hell (or the ring of fire on top of Hindarfjall) and watching Django and Dr. Schultz step into the flames is madness. Watching their plan fall apart because each of their Hamartia, both having too much pride to come out unscathed makes my stomach churn because at that point we love them and are rooting for them.I love Tarantino, but there's something about Django Unchained for me. Maybe it's because it was my first. This is one of the best movies ever made.",

It's a good watch, but nothing great.The cast is amazing; it couldn't have been better. Foxx is amazing as Django; he gets into the shoes of the free black western bounty hunter. DiCaprio and Jackson seem at ease in their villainous hues. For me, it's Christoph Waltz who steals the show, again (remember 'Inglourious Basterds').The background score is admirable. The screenplay could have been a little tighter. The second half is long and dragging. Even with the explosive final hour, it wasn't able to give the satisfaction of a perfect ending.",

            "review_title": "Over the top blaxploitation as only Tarantino could deliver",
            "content": "If I had to sum up Django Unchained in one word, it would be outrageous. It is wild, over the top, often bordering on insane, and an incredible amount of fun. It's seventies blaxploitation on steroids, but with A-list acting, direction, and production values. This movie does for blaxploitation and spaghetti westerns what Kill Bill did for Kung-fu, and also manages at times to be a serious examination of slavery.Django unchained features one of the least subtle openings ever put on film; a montage of shackled, half naked slaves trudging across desert and mountain, prodded on by their overseers as a sappy country-esque balled laments Djangos fate. This is immediately followed by a scene in which a German doctor driving a wagon topped with a spring mounted tooth inquires about purchasing Django, shoots the overseers when they prove less than friendly, calmly completes his transaction with the man he has just severely wounded, and offhandedly suggests that the other slaves might now be able to kill their master and escape. This will set the tone for what's to come.T he acting here is exceptional, and the actors obviously loved (nearly) every minute of their work. Jamie Foxx puts in his best work in years as the titular hero. He undergoes a full transformation from wide-eyed, bewildered slave to badass bounty hunter, effortlessly shifting between action, drama, and comedy as needed. On the strength of this performance he will likely be the gold standard of coolness for blacks everywhere, a latter day Shaft.Christopher Waltz is less varied but no less effective as the genteel assassin Dr. Waltz. He's delightfully eccentric, with a fastidious manner and flair for sarcasm and veiled insults that gives him an uncanny aura of young Mel Brooks. Leonardo Dicaprio meanwhile is the perfect villain. Sophisticated, charming, arrogant, and an utter psychopath, he's the kind of man makes you want to punch him in the face. And Samuel L. Jackson is utterly priceless as the most rabid example of Uncle-Tomism imaginable. I don't know how he kept a straight face while reciting his lines.And there ever some great lines in this movie. Terantino's way with words is as strong as always, are there are numerous quotable lines, I'm especially intrigued by his use of the N-word. With somewhere north of 200 uses of this epitaph, this movie probably sets some kind of record. But what's more interesting than it's pervasiveness is how it's used. Characters hurl it as an insult, direct it playfully at friends or themselves, or use it casually to refer to anyone with dark skin. It's used as a noun, an adjective, and as punctuation. Depending on the circumstances, the use of the N-word can evoke laughter, inspire hatred for the character uttering it, or pass almost unnoticed. It's used so often and in so many ways that it becomes an integral part of the film's texture and doesn't even seem shocking after the first few minutes.Extreme violence is as big a part of this film as coarse language, and one of its main selling points. Tarantino has long been an expert at creating beautiful, highly stylized combat and at using graphic violence for shock value and comedic effect, and he uses it here for all of these purposes. There are drawn out slow motion gunfights in which bullets strike bodies again and again, producing red geysers that spatter the fighters and their surroundings. And then there are shooting happen so quickly that the bad guys are lying dead before you realize what's happened.There are points where the heroes casually kneecap their enemies while losing wisecracks, or where calmly carry on conversations while tracking their targets, with the gunshot providing humorous punctuation their sentences. It's shocking, over the top, and oft hilarious, just as with all his films. But this time around Tarantino has also used violence for another purpose: to highlight the evil and brutality of slavery.Besides the standard whippings there's a scene of Mandingo fighting, a blood sport in which slaves fight to the death, and later we see a man torn to shreds by dogs. These parts are even more shocking than the infamous ear scene in Reservoir Dogs, and not in a way that's beautiful, entertaining or titillating. They are disturbing and incredibly hard to watch, and are intended to be. Because they are meant as a powerful reminder of the inhumanities that the slave trade bred. This is certainly more brutal than was the norm, but such things did happen.This is a great movie. It's well acted, action packed, exciting, and frequently hilarious, as in a side splitting discussion of the logistics of lynch mobs. It can be absolutely nuts one moment and mournfully serious the next without missing a beat. It's Roots meets Boss N****r in a way that only Quentin Tarantino could pull off. Django Unchained may or may not be the best movie of 2012, but it's the most fun you'll have in theaters all year.",

            "content": "Just saw Django Unchained last night - and it is a great movie. Best film from Tarantino since Pulp Fiction. Entertaining as hell, it's also thought-provoking, stylish, funny, exciting, and also true-to-life. It tells the the truth about a great evil of American history - slavery - wrapped in a fable of heroism and true love. Django Unchained is basically a love story. Love sets Django and Brunhilde free. They gain their freedom, despite the entire evil system of slavery, through their devotion to one another and the help of an unlikely ally, an itinerant German dentist-turned-bounty hunter, King Schultz. Schultz is played by Christoph Waltz, in a portrayal as brilliant as his bad-guy turn in Inglorious Basterds. The killer-dentist is drawn into the love story as he recognizes Django as a modern-day incarnation of the Germanic hero Siegfried, the dragon slayer. Only this time, the dragon is slavery itself, incarnated as Calvin Candie, played to hideous perfection by Leo DiCaprio. DiCaprio's Candie is a perfect villain: evil and disgusting, yet completely believable. Most of the negative reviews of this movie have come from Southerners who find Candie too close for comfort; unfortunately, his form of corrupt brutality is still found among the racist rednecks of this country. Sad but true.Jamie Foxx is excellent as Django. When we first meet him he is still a slave, and can barely comprehend the possibility of freedom for himself or his beloved. We see Django develop from degraded chattel to triumphant freeman over the course of the film, and it is a wonderful transformation. Initially, when he is first freed by Schultz, he can hardly believe that he can choose his own clothing. By the end, he is a hero of Wagnerian proportions, who brings down the entire rotten edifice of Candieland through his singular skill, courage, and intelligence. It is a wonderful sight to behold. The villains are almost as good as the heroes here. DiCaprio and Jackson present the banality of evil in rotten technicolor and spaghetti-western splendor. Jackson as the evil quisling is horrifying and true - I don't think any movie has ever portrayed this kind of character in such dismal clarity and repugnant verity - truly a star turn for Samuel L. Bravo and congrats, this was a difficult role, and he pulls it off to perfection. Quentin Tarantino set himself a difficult (maybe impossible) bar with the brilliance of Pulp Fiction. Maybe he'll never reach that level again. But Django Unchained shows that he still has the potential of greatness within him. It's his best movie since Pulp Fiction, even better than Jackie Brown. Wise, courageous, and funny as hell, Django is a instant classic. Move over, Blondie, there's a new sheriff in town, and his name Django. (The D is silent!)",

            "content": "\"Quentin Tarantino's attempt at a spaghetti western is mixed using usual Tarantino comedy in some situations but with one to many endings to the story the film does feel slow going through the whole film\" In 2009 when Inglorious Basterds was released I was such a big fan and was excited to see what his follow up role would be. This film tells the story of a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) and when he met Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) who took him to be a bounty hunter to help find some brothers in reward for Django's freedom. After the two succeed in their mission Schultz decides to help Django find his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who happens to be on Candieland owned by the very cruel slave owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).The film does not feel edited like any other Tarantino film because the edit does not feel as tight and that is sad because unfortunately Tarantino's long running editor died, the film still was a good edit but with the absence of Sally it just not feel as tamed as his past works. The film is long as we see Django and Schultz travel over many distances to different lands meeting many strange characters. The film does have the usual Tarantino fare through the spoken dialogue especially displayed by the character of Dr. King. The film does contain the surprise of the character Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) who we first see as a slave but it is later revealed what he truly means to the character of Calvin and how he is the true evil character in the film. Some scenes seemed out of place and the fact the film had two shootouts was too much for me to watch because it felt like Tarantino was trying to shock with the buckets of blood used. The film does show the violence of slavery very rough when many slaves are punished.Jamie Foxx plays Django and the character of Django is not as flashy as the supporting characters but Foxx is fine in the role I believe just being a murder machine throughout the film. Christoph Waltz plays Dr. King Schultz and once again playing a German for Tarantino, Waltz has mastered this language making almost all of his lines hilarious. In this film Waltz is not the villain but a hero of sorts and Waltz performance is maybe not as good as Basterds but still a great performance. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the villain Calvin Candie and while he plays the character well I had some problems when his character showed his rage and DiCaprio's screaming voice just does not work and that is why his performance was not as amazing as the character I red could have been. Samuel L. Jackson plays Stephen and from the moment her appears till his explosive departure he steals the film from every other character in the film. Jackson plays the character so well and once we find out the secret of the character that interesting turn was played so well and shows Stephen was the true evil of the whole piece. Kerry Washington plays Broomhilda and for the first time in a Tarantino film he does not have a strong women and Washington's performance suffers from being underwritten not really doing much but be the damsel in distress. The rest of the cast is used much less but every other character has at least one funny moment and some standouts of the smaller roles are Don Johnson and Walton Goggins.The film is not the mess I thought it would be compared to other films in Tarantino's past the story is not as strong and while the production values of the film are great not much scenes in the film seem as memorable as scenes that have been in some of his past films. It's still great to see some of these actors do great work and seeing Jackson and Waltz together in a Tarantino film is perfect as they are the best actors he has ever worked with.MOVIE GRADE: B (MVP: Samuel L. Jackson)",

The fantastic moment where Luke gets to say \"I'm Luke Skywalker, I'm here to rescue you!\"Django is all about the suspense inherent in a dangerous rescue mission, Leonardo DiCaprio plays our Darth Vader here, a truly frightening slave plantation owner and sadist in a brilliant turn.Han Solo was a bounty hunter and Luke a young knight looking for a quest, this is also a film about a bounty hunter and a knight with a quest: Django's quest is to rescue his wife.In fact, you could say that by focusing the film on chivalry the bag of loot or treasure becomes the damsel (his true love) in distress and our hero can be purified by his violent actions motivated by love rather than damned by violent actions motivated purely by greed. Beneath the swagger Tarantino's narratives are grounded in a fervently moral universe where the evil that men do is, if not punished, condemned.Tarantino's own cameo is one of the funniest I've ever seen - this is mostly because of the explosive punchline - although it is also an amusing Australian accent!Righteous anger, the basic urge to destroy and revolt against injustice.This is a beautifully made film, well-structured, suspenseful, funny, inventive, the world created is seamless, the acting rich, the photography glorious, and the violence is sickening and brutal but justified.",

The film is 2 hours and 45 minutes long, but it sure didn't feel like it, aside from some pain in my leg.The characters were great, my favourite being Dr. Schultz. The leads are well developed, and all have their moments. Just to summarize, the acting was good and you believed who the characters were. The violence in this film is something only Tarantino would do, when people get shot, they turn into blood fountains. It is on par with Kill Bill in terms of gore. The cinematography was beautiful and the soundtrack was really good, it fit well with the film. The plantation shootout towards the end was incredible and extremely bloody, I felt that should have been the end because it was such a big and memorable scene, and the film slowed down after that adrenaline rush.I've been seeing a lot of reviews giving this film a 1 star rating, why? Because they don't understand Tarantino or the type of movie he was trying to make, this film is presented like a mix of Inglorious Basterds and exploitation films from the 60s and 70s. This movie is not meant to be taken seriously, but people just don't understand,the people complaining or over sensitive or only enjoy Uber serious movies. And people complaining about the over use of the N word is ridiculous, have they even scene Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown, plenty of N words in those but no one complains. There are a lot more offensive movies out there that don't get as much hate. Anyone who has seen his prior work will understand why the movie is like it is.This film was a really good time, and very funny, the audience liked it a lot. It was good to finally see a Tarantino film on the big screen and an overall memorable experience. Not his best film, but definitely one of the best films of the year.Jan 18: I just saw an article that states the following, collectible line is discontinued. That hurts and it hurts hard.

This movie was much better than I expected! Not that I expected it to be bad, but I just didn't expect it to be that good! It's hilarious and entertaining throughout the whole movie, and despite it's running time at almost 3 hours, the movie never lets up because of awesome lines and scenes, tons of crazy Tarantino-action, and amazing characters! Of all of Tarantinos movies, I've only seen Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds. And I thought Django Unchained to be better than Basterds, and slightly up there with Fiction... And that's a huge compliment!Unchained is about a slave named Django (Foxx) who is \"rescues\" by a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (Waltz). In return for Django's freedom he is to help Schultz to track down and eliminate the Brittle brothers. And then Schultz will agree to help Django save his wife (Washingon) from a brutal plantation owner (DiCaprio) and his butler! Tarantino once again impresses and demonstrates to the audience, that he is a ferm and competent screenwriter, given that the movie contains lots of memorable dialog! Tarantinos direction is also very good! Although, sometimes I thought that this movie was made entirely for the fun of it! That's not necessarily a bad thing, but just saying. One of the great things about Unchained, is how expertly the story is told! You start from the beginning along with the characters, and you end the movie with the characters! I must give my congratulations to Mr. Tarantino!Much people have complained about the movies portrayal of slave trait in those days! I didn't really care because I knew it was a Tarantino movie, and he isn't one of those who think to much about how offensive his movies might be! He shot up Hitler in a movie theater, for gods sake! It's just for the fun of it!Jamie Foxx seems slightly uncomfortable in the role of Django at first, but he quickly makes up for that and evolves with the character. That may have been the point! A job well done to Foxx! The true stars however is Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCario who both completely disappears into their roles, and deliver every single line with finesse! Waltz deserved the Oscar nom, and Leo was robbed of one! Samuel L. Jackson also delivers a comedic and an over the top performance as Stephen, Candies man servant and butler! Kerry Washingon doesn't have much to do, but she delivers a decent performance! Django Unchained is an hilarious action movie with great storytelling, amazing characters, great performances, great directing, amazing script and action filled with CGI blood, that will make you laugh so hard! This is definitely a great movie by Tarantino! I can't say if it's my favorite, given that I haven't seen to much of his movies, but an amazing movie nonetheless!

Some of the actors were cast better than others(i.e.: Waltz>Foxx), but none of the performances were less than decent. The soundtrack was going really neat. However, I was truly disappointed by the rap/hip hop tracks. I'm all up for anachronisms and culture mixes when they fit the purpose, but these just didn't flow along with neither the scenes or the theme of the film itself. There were some weak points in the plot which turned me down a little bit (especially after the 2 hours mark), but the outcome, though predictable, makes up for it.

Tarantino, in a brief cameo, is the only one that avoids using the 'N' word (calls Django \"black\") which seemed a bit cowardly IMO, given that he gave the word multiple times to his other characters.The other annoying element- something he does in all of his music but almost too much here- is placing pop music in scenes for an added punch. I just felt that it seemed less effective here.Again, all that said, it's still entertaining enough. The acting is good, and the story moves along pretty well. I'm not sure if the Tarantino formula is getting old. I just think this script is not one of his best. I've seen all of his movies first run in the theater- this one may be my last.",

            "content": "Django Unchained is a bit of a conundrum, largely in part due to it's creator Quentin Tarantino. I have had long love/hate relationship with his movies. When he debuted in 90's with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction I rode shotgun on the Tarantino bandwagon, but as time wore on and more and more of his personality came to light I started to sour. Tarantino strikes me as that kid in middle school that got crammed in a trashcan and rolled down the hill and who was rejected by cheerleaders in high school. He has spent the rest of his life trying to prove to all of us that he really is cool. That desperation for hipness bleeds through in everything he makes. This is not to say he is without talent because he does have a sharp eye and a feel for jaunty banter. He also has a encyclopedic knowledge of film history and flair for homage. That can be double edge sword though, what differentiates insightful reference and a lack of his own voice?That brings us back to Django Unchained which is Tarantino's spin on spaghetti westerns. It's Tarantino through and through. From soundtrack to visuals it all screams \"LOOK HOW COOL I AM!\" and occasionally it's right. There are scenes that feature genuine humor and visual flash as well as some solid performances in particular from Sam Jackson, who steals all of his scenes. All of this is smothered in Tarantino juice and there's the rub. If you love him you'll the love movie but if you think he's a pretentious douche bag this movie won't change your opinion. So many of his conceits took me right out of the movie from his typical \"hip\" soundtrack to Jamie Foxx's sunglasses.Django Unchained like most of Tarantino's movies is unapologetic in it's violence and often wanders the gray wastes of where just tasteless ends and where offensive begins. One has to question if he makes these forays for anything other then shock value. Despite all of Tarantino's efforts, he doesn't quite drive me away. Beneath it all Django Unchained is a serviceable revenge tale with several water cooler moments but beyond that? ... More shock then awe.... and this has been The Mack Minute.

I feel sick as a movie and music lover. Alfred Hitchcock will be rolling in his grave. Whoever thought it feasible to put this type of music in a western should of got four lashes with the whip. You need dramatic, moody and captivating scores. Tarantino... you should of better known better. On the other hand the acting was superb. It moved and captivated me and I often felt I wanted to reach into the screen and kill the slave-masters myself. Only to be thrown back to reality by the bad choice of songs. Err... pop songs? These songs will be outdated in a small number of years. Rendering the film mediocre and maybe forgotten by many. Where as it could of been a timeless gem. Absolutely abysmal. Some people may read this and agree with me. Where as others would say \"I bet he couldn't do better\". But I'm damn sure I could with ease.

Again lots are offended by this movie of his as well.Many as with my self, will be offended with a few scenes in this movie. I'm not talking about the over the top gory violence involving the massive gun shot outs. I'm talking about the realistic brutal violence done to the slaves. Also the spectacular portrayal of Quentin's character Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio should offend. Really if your not offended then there's a problem. The films offencive nature is relay what makes this movie stand alone in its genre. It exerts a powerful grasp with the mix of dark comedy woven in its themes of racism, slavery and brutality.

Charting the exploits of freed slave Django (Jamie Foxx) as he tracks down wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), this story doesn't say as much as it thinks \u2013 or as much as Quentin proclaimed \u2013 about slavery in the mid 18th century, instead offering up a blood-splattering, popcorn-fuelled revenge pic that has a tendency to allow its characters slip into caricatures. In that framework it succeeds, and there are a plethora of vintage-Tarantino sequences that are an absolute joy to watch; not least the montage halfway through featuring an anachronistically awesome hip-hop tune fused with country music. The undebatable highlight of the movie though is Christoph Waltz, dishing up an indelible performance as German dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr King Schultz. He knows his way around Tarantino's famously verbose dialogue like no-one else and the film suffers ever so slightly whenever he is not on screen. It's too long at 165 minutes, but there's plenty of violent, stylish fun to be had.",

Will somebody get this guy an editor? I'm willing to put up with QT's usual anachronisms, and even his flagrant nonsensical sequences: at one point his hero, en route from Texas to Tennessee, is shown bathing in a Yellowstone(i.e., Wyoming/Montana) hot pool, with the Grand Tetons in the background. I suppose the hot springs could be in Arkansas-which would make sense-but not the Grand Tetons.

            "content": "I really have to believe that if Quentin Tarantino and I had actually lived near one another as we were growing up, we would have probably been great friends; or at least seen each other attending the same movies. I know this sound utterly prosperous, but in his recent film \"Django Unchained\", he has really added some great 'spaghetti western' homage moments from some very obscure films which included movie scores from \"Two Mules for Sister Sara\" (Clint Eastwood / Shirley MacLaine) and \"My Name is Trinity\" (Terence Hill / Bud Spencer); two films in which I utterly adore. I love a good Western, and Tarantino does not disappoint with his interpretation of this genre. Returning for his second Tarantino film after his Academy Award Winning performance in 'Inglorious Basterds', Christopher Waltz is Dr. Schultz, a former dentist turned bounty hunter. He is in pursuit of three (3) ruthless brothers; however, he needs the assistance of a runaway slave, Django (played by Jamie Fox), to identify his criminal quarry. After recovering his reward bounty, Dr. Schultz (Waltz) reaches a mutual agreement with Django (Fox) to maintain their partnership throughout the winter, and in return Dr. Schultz will assist Django in finding his wife whose whereabouts are somewhere deep in the heart of Dixie. Under Dr. Schultz's tutelage, Django is able to hone his skills as a bona fide bounty hunter and gunslinger in his own right.Director Tarantino is a skilled story-teller. Whether it's a botched bank heist or a vampire diner from hell, Tarantino's filmmaking esthetic is easily identifiable. No one in the industry can show a bullet piercing flesh, and the blood splatter associated with that infliction better than Quentin Tarantino\u0085 and I can assure you, that blood splatter budget was not scrimped on in the production of this film. From the opening sequence to the ending credits, this film screams Tarantino. Even his five (5) minute cameo in this film is so over-the-top, it's easily remembered and will be often referred to.This film has an all-star cast featuring the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Samuel L. Jackson, and Christopher Waltz; and a production budget of $100 Million dollars. This film has everything that you have come to expect in a Quentin Tarantino film: awesome gunfight sequences, blood-shed galore, great story telling, and what I'd like to refer to as a \"Blazing Saddles\"-esque comedy sequence referring to pillow-case hoods and eye-hole placement that is absolutely hilarious!!!This is a MUST SEE film for enthusiasts of the Western genre or fans of Quentin Tarantino, I highly recommend this film. Running 165 minutes in length, the film flows effortlessly. I was actually shocked at how long the film was after it had finished, because I had not referred my watch once while watching it. Another Tarantino accolade to great filmmaking and keeping the audience fully engaged and entertained. Again this is not your father's typical Western; it's a Tarantino interpretation of a Western. It's 'Pulp Fiction' meets 'A Fistful of Dollars' with all the Tarantino artistic brutality thrown in to heighten your visual viewing experience. So view this film with caution, and revel in your memories of your Saturday Matin\u00e9e film jaunts of your youth brought into the 21st Century with a Quentin Tarantino graphic embellishment.

            "review_title": "Tarantino Unchained",
            "content": "This is one of my favorite movie this year. Thank Tarantino for giving me two short but happy hours of surprise and excitement. I've heard a lot about this film before, but never had a chance to watch it until now. Tarantino's work never disappoints me before and yet He brings us another masterpiece of his film fantasy.Just to make it clear, I am not really a big fan of \"Westerns\", whether it is American Western or Spaghetti Western. The last Western I remembered is still \"No Country For Old Man\". However, I am a big lover of Rockstar's classic game, \"Red Dead: Redemption\". After watching this film, it just gave me an urge to play the game from start once again.First, I'd like to share my opinions on this film from an overall perspective, then shift our focus on the performance of the cast.To beginning, I like Tarantino's version of aesthetics of violence, thus every minute of the film is of great joy to me. Watching gun blazing like fire spitting, blood splashing like a fountain and people hit by bullets like a watermelon, not to mention the splendid explosion scenes, makes my blood burning and heart pumping fast. Every aspect of violence scene is done well and some horseback riding scene is excellent. I always tend to think Tarantino creates films in a way like a kid playing with his toy as he can do whatever he likes. As a result, in the making of this film, Tarantino's imagination is like an unchained horse running wild.As is expected, Tarantino's film always comes with great music. Every piece of music used in this movie has the mark of his unique taste. If we listen to these music separately, most of them would feel special, some even odd. But when put under the context of movie, every single piece of music just blend in with background and it surprises us to realize that they are in perfect harmony with each other. It always gives me great pleasure to listen the background music as the movie progresses, and I smile every time when I don't understand why the music feels so right in the movie. But there is only one problem, the rap songs. Is it just me or the rap is really out of place? It always bounce me out of the movie. Not that the raps are bad, but whenever it is played, it just don't feel so \"western\" anymore. But anyway, it could be just me.Although this film enjoys considerable merits, it's not flawless. As I said, Tarantino's imagination is unchained. But as a result, it also lacks direction or focus. As I quote from another high voted review, \"I enjoy every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels\"(Reference Link). For example, the search for the Britle Brothers which I initially thought to be the centerpiece of the film ends too fast. I anticipated it to last at least half an hour before Django and Dr.Schultz complete their first mission. However, it ends in minutes. It would be episodic if it is more detailed. Beyond this, the film ending seems too smooth for Django, even a little unreal. For example, it is totally unreasonable for Stephen the butler and Lara the hostess to give Django away to a railway company when they have a chance to finish him. For a merciless and skilled bounty hunter like Django, he is certain to come back and take his revenge. He kills a dozen of fully armed slave overseers within minutes, how can you feel safe when he is in custody of anyone? Nevertheless, a few flaws can not belittle many virtues of the film. Djanglo Unchained still remains to be a great movie, so I will rate it 9 out of 10 honestly.Although this film has a genius director and a well-written script, it still can't become a classic without its wonderful cast.First of all, Dr.King Schultz played by Christoph Waltz is my favorite character. Christoph gave great performance in this movie. as he did in \"Inglorious Bastards\". Though Dr.Schultz is a merciless bounty hunter, but he deeply despises slavery.Many other wonderful performance are present in this movie as well. Another actor that stands out of the cast is Leanardo Dicaprio. His brilliant performance portrayed a seasoned and cruel slaver with greed and hypocrisy. Jamei Foxx as the main lead, though shadowed by the above two actors, still gives great performance. Though at first he is not comfortable in Django's shoes, but once he finds his foot, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. I think he has a special talent for comedy, because it feel extremely funny when he tries to play serious, like when Django tries to give the slaves a piece of his mind in order not to \"break his character\". As a subtle actor, He is also able to offer audience a peek into Django's emotions with a little changes in his expression or gesture. Summel L. Jackson's performance as the black butler Stephen is also outstanding. Stephen is obviously more experienced than Dandie. After nearly 70 years of torturing slaves, he completely betrayed his race and degenerated into a lick-spittle for the slavers. Djanglo calls him \"snowball\" not only because his hair whitened because of age, but also because he is a \"white\" slaver with a black face. The audience hates Stephen more than Dandie, so it gives me great joy to see Djanglo put Stephen into justice.In summary, \"Django: Unchained\" is a must-see for a Tarantino fun and anyone who is looking for a western with thrilling action and funny comedy.",

            "content": "Hell Yeah! It's Tarantino time again! Being that Pulp Fiction is my favourite film of all time, you can probably tell how excited I was to go see Django Unchained. I mean, Quentin Trantiono reinventing the Western with Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson? Wow gotta go see that, here is 6.50, keep the change. And boy was it worth paying money to see this film! If they had raised the money even higher, I would still have gone to see it! It's his best movie since Pulp Fiction, period. I mean Kill Bill was pretty good, Death Proof was good, Inglorious Basterds was excellent and now Django Unchained is his third best movie, the first two being Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.The Good: The Story. This is a basic revenge/rescue story but it works so well and everything makes sense. Set in the antebellum era of the Deep South and Old West, the film follows a freed slave (Foxx) who treks across the United States with a bounty hunter (Waltz) on a mission to rescue his wife (Kelly Washington) from a cruel and charismatic plantation owner (DiCaprio). The plot is simple but works to its advantage because it allows the audience to appreciate everything a Western is. When it comes down to it, a Western is most of the time a search for some sort of treasure or redemption with a bad ass hero who squints and smokes a lot. That's what I think when it comes to Westerns. Tarantino strips it to this basic premise and then adds things to it that give it its unique Tarantino twist. Like the part with the Klu Klux Klan, that was unexpectedly funny as hell. Little things like that have defined Tarantino as a director for the past twenty years and it still works.The Casting and Characters. One of the things I love about all of Tarantino's films is the casting. Jamie Foxx plays the emotions of a freed slave well, turning him from a timid and frightened slave to a gun-slinging bad ass, a typical character development in a lot of Westerns. However, that said I loved Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Shultz. Not only does he play his character well, but steals every scene he is in and I was genuinely sorry that he died in the film. Then we have Leonardo DiCaprio as the film's main villain, Calvin Candie. It's funny, I usually can't picture Golden Boy Leo in a role like this but he blew me away. Calvin Candie is one of the most evil villains I have ever seen in a film and he's played by the love interest from Titanic. I think this pretty much proves that DiCaprio is versatile and has range. And, like Waltz, he steals every scene he is in. And then finally we have Stephen, a senior house slave, played by Samuel L. Jackson. And this is where the viewer questions who the actual main villain is: Candie or Stephen? Because, a lot of the time, Stephen seems to be controlling Candie with his words. However, I do believe, Candie is the main villain. But Jackson, in a twist of fate, seems to also steal every scene he's in. So, if I can get this straight, we have three actors who all steal the scenes they're in and they are all together in a lot of scenes. This, ladies and gents, is the Tarantino genius. As well as these awesome actors, we also get the usual Tarantino cameo and the brief time he's in there is pretty freaking funny and he dies in the most over-the-top way. As for the love interest, although she really doesn't have a lot to do, it doesn't really matter since the focus of the story is on Django.The Music. Tarantino has always displayed an odd use of music in his films which work for a lot of the time. This film is no different. There is a variety of musical genres used, including country, southern rock and even rap. All of these genres work and it can now definitely be said that Westerns will never be the same again just thanks to the music used in this film.The Script. The dialogue in this film is written in that trademark Tarantino style: in that it uses tons of foul language and witty retorts. Now that he's done a Western, he pretty much has free reign over how much foul language there is and still making it clever. Of course, the \"N\" word is repeated often and has generated controversy but those people are people who have had a stick up their bum all their life. If the human race wishes to progress, we mustn't allow ourselves to be shocked by words like that and come to terms with them and accept them.The Violence. The violence is one of the best things about this film. This is another controversial trademark of Tarantino's and it is executed beautifully, especially since all the blood is squibs, not digital. Tarantino violence is the sort that's so over-the-top, it's actually kind of funny. I laughed when a lot of violent moments came along, like when Laura Lee died, that was hilarious. It's like Pulp Fiction, that's the sort of violence it is.The Cinematography. The cinematography in this film is executed to absolute perfection. Using sudden extreme close-ups and a text scroll, this movie pays more tribute to old westerns than the westerns that have been coming out recently. Excellently shot and well made.The Bad: ... There is none.Final Verdict: 10/10 Instant Classic. This is Tarantino's most ambitious project and it has paid off so well. This is my absolute favourite of 2012. Django Unchained has excellent story, characters, acting, script, music and cinematography. And Samuel L. Jackson repeats the \"N\" word excessively. What's not to like? Instant Classic.",

            "content": "If this review had be one sentence, it would be this: Go See This Movie! It is 100 percent awesome! When the movie was over, I had this giant smile on my face. So, what is the story? Set in the antebellum era of the Deep South and Old West, the film follows a freed slave (Foxx) who treks across the United States with a bounty hunter (Waltz) on a mission to rescue his wife (Washington) from a cruel plantation owner (DiCaprio). First off, the story is original, I could not guess on what could happen in the story, and it kept my attention all the way through. It contains moments where some scenes that me feel unpleasant, but in the good way, as it made me care for the characthers and the struggles they had to face. Speaking of the characthers, all of them are written perfectly, and acted to perfection. In fact, they maybe the best that Tarantino has ever written, thanks to some great characther develpoment. Jamie Foxx was great as Django. He is likable, has funny moments, and has great characther develpoment. He turns from this slave that barely speaks, to someone that has moments that made me say Heck Yeah! Also in the cast, is Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz. Again he is likable, has some of the best dialogue in the movie, and has brilliant chemistry with Django. I am happy he won best supporting actor at the Oscars. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Calvin Candile, who is a villain I love to hate. His dialogue is brilliant, and becomes more creepier as we learn more about him. It great to see Leo takes this type of role, clearing showing that he is a talented actor. And last, but not least, Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen. Most of things he says in this movie is hilarious! and has great banter with DiCaprio characther. I mention the dialogue several times already, so shorty I say this. It is sharp and writty as ever, something that Tarantino is known for. It helps bring the world, story, and characthers to a whole new level. It uses the N word 114 times, but the film does it in a way that makes it funny and enjoyable. People have gotten mad about it, but Quentin Tarantino is not going to care about it, so why should I care? The action is awesome. It's bloody, and greatly shot. Now are there flaws? Well, it is a long movie, and it does feel long. However, thanks to everything I mention, this is only a minor gripe, and I appreciate Tarantino took the risk. Now, it time for the final verdict. As you can tell, I love this movie. It has a great story, dialogue, characthers, and everything I love about Tarantino. So without a doubt, the final verdict is my first 10/10 in my reviews. Now it is not perfect, but no film is. Every film has it's faults, but what the film does right, it does so with perfection. And this movie gets my first Awesometaclur seal of approval. Tarantino has created a masterpiece, that no sane human should miss. With that said, I see you guys on the next review.",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's wickedly original farce \"Django Unchained\" does for slavery what his \"Inglorious Basterds\" did for World War II. Namely, it rewrites history as it SHOULD have been, not how it actually was. In \"Basterds,\" we got to see Hitler and his murderous minions taken out well ahead of schedule by a motley group of allied assassins. In \"Django,\" we get to see freed slave Django Freeman doing pretty much the same to just about every racist white villain unfortunate enough to cross his path. In short, \"Django Unchained\" goes beyond mere historical revisionism to historical wish-fulfillment fantasy and helps to lay the foundation for a new genre in the process.As \"Django Unchained\" opens, the title character is part of a group of chained slaves en route to auction. However, before they can get there, Django is freed by a loquacious, silver-tongued German man (played brilliantly by the scene-stealing Christoph Waltz) who is appalled by slavery and who asks Django to partner up with him as a bounty hunter. In addition to tracking down and killing wanted fugitives, the two make it their mission to rescue Django's wife (Kerry Washington) from bondage to an infamous plantation owner, played by Leonardo DeCaprio in one of his finest performances to date.Django actually began life as a character in a series of spaghetti westerns dating back to the mid 1960s and, indeed, Tarantino has included many spaghetti western tropes in his film, even though most of the movie takes place in the pre-bellum South. This Django is \"very loosely based\" on the earlier one, seeing as how the original, played by Franco Nero (who makes a cameo appearance in this film), was not a black slave but rather a white Union soldier.There's no denying the purgative effect of seeing Django delivering some frontier justice to all those slave owners and white oppressors who deserve everything they get at his hands. But Tarantino has never been one to see the world in black-and-white terms, nor as a simplistic conflict between evil and good. There's a highly disturbing scene, for instance, where Django, determined not to blow his cover as a black slave trader, allows another slave to be mauled to death by dogs, a scene that shows Tarantino will even risk alienating Django from the audience if that means staying true to his vision. The director has clearly come to play, and he has no use for cleanly delineated lines between right and wrong, not when a person's very survival is at stake. The world he is showing us is simply too brutal, too unforgiving for such moral niceties to have much sway.As an artist, Tarantino is clearly at the top of his game here, blending a host of seemingly contradictory elements into a seamless, eclectic whole. He mixes acerbic humor with hyper-stylized violence, and places flawless period piece detail against a soundtrack filled with contemporary songs, some already released and some written directly for the movie. Tarantino isn't afraid to linger long over his scenes, letting the audience savor every last juicy line of dialogue he's placed in the mouths of his characters. For the writing is always the best part of any Tarantino film, and he doesn't let us down here.And that's probably why the actors seem to be having the time of their professional lives in this film. While Jamie Foxx is taciturn and tight-lipped (as any hero - or antihero - of the West should be), Waltz, Di Caprio and Samuel L. Jackson, as the ultimate sycophantic house slave (often playing the Fool to DiCaprio's Lear), go head-to-head in a no-holds-barred war of verbal gymnastics. The writing and performances are so much fun on their own, in fact, that Tarantino's dazzling visuals sometimes seem like just an unusually tasty dessert designed by the chef to top off the meal.Tarantino clearly lives and breathes cinema, and thus he has populated his canvas with a vast array of familiar faces from movies and TV, past and present, some in very minor roles: Don Johnson, Walter Goggins, Russ and Amber Tamblyn, Bruce Dern, Don Stroud, Jonah Hill, James Parks, and Tarantino himself.The filmmaker's latest opus may not be for every viewer, but if you're looking for an iconoclastic work that has little regard for propriety and good taste and is not afraid to venture out into previously uncharted territory, then \"Django Unchained\" is the movie for you.",

            "content": "In many ways, Django Unchained is very similar to Inglourious Basterds. They both are derived from European B-movies and are set in times where the world wasn't on the top of its game. But whereas Basterds worked precariously around the mass armed conflict at the time, Django fires six shots into the heart of the issue that has generally been turned away from in cinema: slavery. And where Basterds was a decidedly more dramatic film with only small bits of humour, Django is usually less serious but with select instances of pure pain. In a year of blockbuster disappointment, Django Unchained stands tall and free, delivering almost 3 hours of cinematic goodness.Right from the first frame it's apparent that there's another very important influence on this film, and that is the spaghetti western. From the font of the opening titles to the throwback theme songs, Django is a movie about slavery with the style of a certain Italian filmmaker. This \"neowestern\" as I shall call it doesn't contain long stares in ghost towns, but has plenty of shooting and flair. And with a name like Tarantino's attached, you know it's getting the double dose of brutality.I mentioned earlier the humour is more apparent than in Basterds. The shootouts are ridiculous, the characters zany, and it's always a pleasure to hear Samuel L. Jackson saying m*****f*****. I want to especially point out the scene with the KKK for being especially hilarious, and the audience agreed with me that Django is fairly light considering how the topic could be taken. But, like the famous \"How am I funny?\" scene in Goodfellas, the South as it is often presented to us in films such as Gone with the Wind (for the record, this film affects my opinion of that one negatively) is quite ridiculous. Sure, we can laugh at the old white folks being astonished to see \"a n**** on a horse\", but things like that happened. People were horrible and slavery was one of the great abominations in human history. And on two occasions, like Tommy deVito, Tarantino drops the facade. Two scenes that still play in my mind, gut-wrenching scenes highlighting the cruelty of man. Django Unchained is violent, but only in these two scenes is it truly disturbing.But after the scenes hit home the dresses get put back on and you are graciously welcomed to Candyland again. The writing is expectedly top notch, able to return to a warm place after unflinching brutality. The dialogue is laden with profanity and wit, complimenting the action scenes for a very briskly paced film that feels much shorter than its 2 hours 45 minute runtime. The characters tentpole the film though. Django, the slave reborn as a vengeful killer, has all the style, moves and flair of a gunslinging hero. Although it's his name in the title the film belongs to DiCaprio and Waltz. Leo's Calvin Candie is a despicable man who relishes what he does, and leaves all traces of prettyboy hero Leo at the door. And Waltz as the bounty hunter Dr. Schultz is a quirky and good natured man. I think it's the beard. Very much unlike his last role in a Tarantino film.Samuel L. Jackson plays a curiously loyal house slave though character is never really fleshed out, and though he gets a lot of great lines his presence feels a bit off. Likewise, Django's wife Broomhilda gets very little to say despite being the subject of the film's quest. She was mostly just... there.Without a doubt Tarantino's films are incredible, movie lovers' movies. And Django Unchained is no exception- little references and unmatched style make a fantastic ride. But a problem that I have with them is depth. The only message that is really taken away is that slavery was brutal, but that isn't really treading new ground. The characters also see little development: Django goes from an angry slave to an angry hunter and Candie's is a functioning monster the whole way through. Only Schultz really changes and it's great to see, so I wonder why he didn't give Django any more transition. Nonetheless, Tarnatino and Western fans won't be disappointed by this, one of the best films of the year. 8.7/10",

QT is getting closer to Stanley Kubrick in that he makes few movies, but when they appear they are masterful.

And another revenge plot with lots and lots of blood.Part of what makes Tarantino so special is the way his scripts are heavy on content; every line is a brightly colored thread in a florid brocade... and normally that's not a good thing--people usually appreciate a lighter touch. And Tarantino does not appear to be getting in the habit of handing those out.I'm suddenly remembering reading Thomas Kuhn's \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\". I was amazed to see a book which met two mutually impossible criteria: Never had I seen writing so dense, and yet at the same time with no fat; every line was necessary.And this is how it is with a Tarantino script; dense, with every line, every character, every scene part of a disquisition on established mores, and the struggle to change the world in a way that confronts those mores, head-on.This is not to say that Tarantino's approach has been consistent, especially in regard to this perennial approach to moral questions. These last two flicks play heavier than ever on a kind of (arguably forgivable) puerile fantasy; after all, everyone hates Nazis and Slavers. And they provide convenient piles, driven a mile into the ground, that anchor his flicks and hold them upright. Earlier productions, like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, achieved great heights of moral probity without recourse to such things. This is why I give RD and PF \"10\" ratings, but Basterds and Unchained a \"lowly\" 9.But, all this cogitating aside, I have to add that I was sometimes moved very deeply by Unchained. Add in the surprise of a charming, light-hearted buddies-on-the-road sequence using a Jim Croce tune as background music, and I've gotta say the thing was very well worth watching.",

They treat blacks like property, and if they step outta line they feel nothing about whipping them, getting dogs to tear them apart, cutting off their tongues and testicles... and that's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Then arrives a former slave in a dapper suit and a serious attitude problem (to put in mildly), who then proceeds to blow these walking piles of trash to kingdom come...No, that's being too gentle... He eviscerates them. He destroys them. He wipes any trace of them from the map. It takes some kind of talent to create such a bloody yet arresting spectacle, but this is Tarantino we're talking about here. He wrote the book on the subject. Even by his colossal standards though, this is just breathtaking filmmaking. I felt like having a street party every time Django pulled his trigger and put one of these SOBs out of their misery.But there's more. So much more. Jamie Foxx is brilliant, a black Charles Bronson if ever I saw one (But with heaps more acting nous). What about Christoph Waltz though, as his partner... the most cunning bounty hunter the West ever saw? And Leonardo DiCaprio, who's a charming yet deadly slave trader? And who could forget the FANTASTIC Samuel L Jackson in probably his finest performance, as a redeemless, treacherous submissive? These four men, in fact the whole cast, fit their characters like a glove... and do the excellent dialogue and absorbing plot full justice.At 2 and a half hours, I wanted it to go on. I didn't look away from the screen once, and even when the proceedings got ever more ridiculous towards the end, Tarantino somehow convinces us that this is all perfectly logical. It's a feast for the eyes, mind and soul, and the sort of film you want to want to rewatch as soon as it's over. In fact, I think I'l do that right now. C ya. 9/10",

            "content": "When you go to see a Tarantino film, there is plenty to expect and prepare yourself for. From unique film angles and stylistic choices to interesting song selections to the ultra violence that may make your stomach turn, Tarantino has basically created a genre of his own over the years that only his films occupy. And it is very easy to include Django Unchained into this list of films as a movie that is nothing short of what we would expect from writer/director Quentin Tarantino.With films like Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, and the Kill Bill pair under his belt, Tarantino takes to a whole new genre and world in his newest film, Django Unchained. A vengeance film set as a western, Tarantino takes us to pre-Civil War America and deep into the south where slavery is at its height. The story follows Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a German bounty hunter who seeks the help of a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) to find his latest bounty. But upon partnering up with the slave, he finds that the man is a natural in the killing business and may come in handy as a partner.Granting Django his freedom, Schultz realizes there is a greater desire driving his new friend: the search to find Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Split up when his previous master sold the couple separately, Django seeks the new owner of his wife and is out to get his lady back. Finding that their partnership has grown into a greater friendship, Schultz partners up with Django on the journey that leads them to the plantation of Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a violent slave owner who is only drawn to the men due to their proposition of buying a fighting slave from him for an over-the-top amount of money.What unfolds is a violent, fun, explosive, and highly entertaining tale that we could only come to expect from Quentin Tarantino. It is an extremely complete film. From the writing and directing of Tarantino to the acting of the entire cast, to the lighting, costumes, and sets, Django Unchained is a really solid piece of filmmaking that reminds us why we get excited for Tarantino films. A film that will make you laugh, but also make your heart pound and put you on the edge of your seat, Django is a very fitting follow up to Inglorious Basterds and fits the Tarantino collection nicely.It starts very early on with a sequence in a small town in Texas. The slightly flamboyant, bold, and proper Schultz comes to life through the experienced acting of Christoph Waltz who (with his second collaboration with Tarantino) may be the best actor to pair with the director ever. Waltz is wonderful in Django Unchained and, maybe even more importantly, he is a good guy in this film that we can cheer along with, unlike Hans Landa in Inglorious Basterds. Dr. King Schultz is an extremely fun character and Waltz brings him to such exuberant life that it makes the entire film that much more enjoyable. Likewise, Jamie Foxx is fantastic as Django. With a strong, Shaft-like demeanor that Django needs and a set of action skills that make him the hero he becomes, Foxx was perfect for the role.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/django-unchained/",

I believe that Jamie Foxx's interpretation was outstanding as Christoph Waltz's (won the Oscar for the Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role of 2013) was. I also believe that the interpretation of Leonardo DiCaprio was equally good and I liked very much the acting of Samuel L. Jackson.I have to say that I strongly recommend this movie because it combines very well adventure and action with drama.",

            "content": "QT rewrote history in Inglourious Basterds to give Jews some poetic justice, and now he empowers the black male with a Western that presents the horrors of slavery whilst still being a rootin', tootin' revenge flick that ranks with his best. As the titular protagonist, Jamie Foxx is appropriately subdued as the freed slave, who strategically accepts Dr King Shultz's offer of a bounty-hunting partnership in order to buy his wife from sadistic plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). He doesn't have a lot to do other than represent black oppression, which he does by \u2013 well, being black. The role of Shultz required a German, so Christoph Waltz was the obvious choice. He is unquestionably brilliant, as he was in Inglourious, and though he's not playing a Nazi this time, you get the sense that he's Col. Landa's saintly twin. It's touching that he helps Django because he views him as Siegfried in the famous German myth: a man who goes through hellfire to rescue his beloved (a tender, affecting Kerry Washington), who completes the myth by having the name Broomhilda von Shaft.DiCaprio is the film's biggest surprise. He had serious misgivings about playing Candy, his first (and possibly last) out and out villain. What will audiences think when they see him give the order for a runaway slave to be ripped apart by wild dogs? QT warned him to go all the way, otherwise audiences wouldn't forgive him; a very apt directive, which DiCaprio has firmly adhered to. His superb performance comes almost entirely from his character's pomposity. QT describes him wonderfully as the petulant boy king, the Louis XIV who is so bored with his inheritance (the fourth largest cotton plantation in Mississippi) that he gets his kicks from brutal Mandingo fights. QT's dialogue is, as always, sensational. Lyrical, eloquent, witty, playful, ingenious \u2013 that's always been his most impressive contribution to cinema. This is the least QT-looking film of his repertoire, but only because this is his most conventional (or least unconventional). A Western, as this is, has fixed associations and images. QT is careful not to impose his knack of creatively subverting genre (too much) to detract from the serious message which he clearly wishes to make.For all the flak QT gets for his approval of cinematic violence, I don't think this is a particularly violent film. We're talking here of the antebellum South, two years before the Civil war. It would be an injustice not to show violence, and an even bigger injustice not to show a true depiction of violence. In fact, the implied violence (Django hanging upside down, waiting to be castrated) is more unsettling than the comic book violence we mostly get. QT wanted to avoid making this a historical film with a capital 'H'. To do so, he said, would have defeated the purpose. Samuel L. Jackson's character, Stephen, exists to prove this. He runs 'Candyland' (superb writing) as proxy lord of the manor, but resents any other free black. He treats his house slaves with a deeper contempt than Candy would, perhaps because it's a way of assuring his own longevity. He's more grotesque than Candy and would be a memorable villain if he didn't make us laugh so much with his bespoke jive. The soundtrack is terrific and the pacing is astonishing considering the 165-minute length. Some of the influence from Sergio Leone Westerns has found its way into this film. Is this one of QT's best? No. Should you see it? You must. QT has made his political points loud and clear; he's got us all talking about America's forgotten holocaust. But has he given cinema the mythical black hero he intended to?",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino continues his one man quest to rewrite historical injustices. His earlier WWII epic re-writing Hitler's downfall as a bloody revenge fantasy. If \"Inglorious Basterds\" was his \"Saving Private Ryan\", this is his \"Amistad\".Taking another inarguable wrong in the form of slavery, he has fashioned a very similar tale as Basterds but in a very different setting, the American South 1858. Utilising Christopher Waltz again to Oscar winning effect, as bounty hunter \"Dr. King Schultz\" with a taste for words and a world view at odds with the period in which he lives.Waltz enters the film purportedly as a travelling dentist complete with preposterous \"Tooth sign\" above his carriage. He requires the help of slave in transit \"Django\" (Jamie Foxx), to identify two slavers just ripe for killing to then collect the bounty placed on their heads. He offers to pay to release Django, in typical Tarantino fashion, this does not go well.Later, Django albeit dressed as adult version of little Lord Fauntleroy, proves his worth against incompetent plantation owner and Klansmen, \"Big Daddy\" (Don Johnson). Schultz quickly recognising that as a team they are a more effective unit, especially with Django's marksmen skills. This ultimately leads to a hunt for Django's captive wife (Kerry Washington) held in the clutches of the notorious brutal slaver and Candieland plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Di Caprio) and his obsequious House Slave \"Stephen\", an almost unrecognisable Samuel L Jackson.Candie is obsessed with Gallic ways yet cannot speak French and juxtaposes his supposed cultured mannerisms with enjoying \"Mandingo\" fights, brutal to the death bouts between slaves trained for the purpose, human dog or cock fighting by any other name.Django is a strange sight for most to see, astride a horse and eventually decked out in a cool cowboy outfit and shades, he is a free black man creating startled looks wherever he goes. Remembering this is a Tarantino movie, the pair leave a violent and bloody trail wherever they travel. The climactic carnage is almost cartoon like, dialled up to 11 but by that point most audience members will be more than willing to see Django blow-away everyone and anyone that deserves their fate.As usual the film is peppered with great dialogue, the opening scene in many ways echoing the famous opening \"Nazi milk scene\" from \"Basterd's\". All of the acting is excellent, Di Caprio acting against type and portraying a monster seemingly with some glee. Waltz is as good as ever in a role clearly tailored for him, with Foxx a stand-out believable character, forced to watch slaves ripped apart by dogs just to maintain his cover.Whilst violent, this is more about revenge and correcting injustices, fantasy yes but tapping into a cinematic need to avenge those with no voice. Tarantino peppers his script with the usual clever dialogue, notably the scene where Klansman headdress is discussed, in may ways using humour to amplify the ridiculousness of the situation. \"Stephens\" reaction to the arrival of \"Django\" another case in point. In typical Tarantino style, music is again used eclectically, like a hyperactive magpie collecting music from different eras and using it in imaginative ways Tarantino acting as an Australian complete with wobbly accent, is perhaps a weak spot and but he saves himself with only brief screen time and also by making a spectacular exit. This is also a long film which does move along quickly but at 165 minutes, may test some audience members \"no break\" policy.The film makes no attempt to send a message or delve into the complexities of slavery, the reason for it's existence and why it took so long to eradicate. However, the ability for plantation owners to quite literally do whatever they wished with their \"possessions\" is amply demonstrated, completely free from outside intervention, with the law quite literally on their side. This is black and white, almost childlike in simplicity, baddies to be killed and wrongs to be righted, with claret splashed style and razor sharp dialogue.Summary Fun, violent, witty and different in every way from anything else you will see, this comes highly recommended from a reviewer not usually appreciative of overly violent movies.Excellent",

It wasn't an adventure. Certainly not a comedy but that might be the best way to think of it as you watch it. I suppose if you call it a drama that would be closest but it was so far fetched it certainly isn't a serious drama.I don't have a problem believing that some plantation owners had many slaves and treated them poorly, or even treated them like animals. It sickens me to see that. No man or woman should ever be a slave to another human.What I do have a problem with is Django being such a good shot, with both hands, that he never misses, or never gets hit with many people shooting at him. This is where calling it a drama begins to fall apart.The way Tarantino directed the shooting scenes was simply outrageous. Bullets of that era, and of the type of handgun shown, would not likely pass through a mans chest and come out through is back. Being shot with a pistol wouldn't propel a person backwards. When a bullet hits a person very small amounts of blood would initially splatter at the moment of impact, not the pint to quart amount shown in almost every shot.Near the very end of this long movie Django shoots a woman from an angle with his pistol and she is violently yanked backwards to the point of lifting her feet off the ground.A lot more realism would have helped make this movie more believable. As it is all of that radically inaccurate depiction constantly left me shaking my head.I liked Jamie Foxx as Django and I thought Christoph Waltz was cast well and did a great job.

Leo passed on the villainous role in Inglorious Basterds, but this time he has embraced it and is having a blast with it. He plays a diabolical man with an equally conniving right hand man played by Samuel L. Jackson. The man Tarantino discovered, Christoph Waltz (who got Leo's role in Basterds in the end) is on the 'good' side this time, but is equally electric. It's funny that the title character actually takes a back-seat as the bigger supporting names take over the film. But Jamie Fox does well with what he is given, and Will Smith must be kicking himself for passing up on a Tarantino movie.This is Tarantino's longest movie, but for those of you who are familiar with his skill-set, that length should not be a concern.

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino redefines and refurbishes Western Spaghetti genre with 'Django Unchained' the same manner in which he reinforced his Tarantino-ism into 'Kill Bill' thereby redefining Japanese and Hong Kong martial art films, and so in short in both the cases -he kills it (in a good way, that is)! Django Unchained's plot is hardly novel and Tarantino adheres dutifully to the forms and conventions of the Western genre -even the pre-Civil war backdrop is peripheral in narrating what is basically a revenge saga; I saw Django as the male counterpart of Bride/Beatrix from Kill Bill and Django's relation with Schultz being similar to Vincent and Jules' in Pulp Fiction (a die-hard Tarantino fan would easily spot more).But Quentin's endeavors are much more than 'recycling or rehashing) -who else shows such panache, such boldness, such passion, such balls to even touch these antique genres and give them such a subversive and transgressive shake they come out brand new as though Quentin was the pioneer of these genres and not those directors who made the movie which inspired the maverick in the first place? Django Unchained, though not as aesthetically and emotionally satisfying as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, is still one hell of a genre-redefining movie which like most Tarantino movies, makes you feel cool and awesome in the end.The director/scriptwriter never really cared for complex themes (but he could construct his narrative expertly, making the plots seem much more complex than they actually are) and Django Unchained is no exception as a single sentence will be enough to describe what the film's about: 'Django, with Dr.Schulz's help, tries to get his wife back and extract his revenge on those who separated his wife from him'. Now that sounds enough, right? No wait -let's just change the 'tries to' to 'will do anything to' -oh yes, that sounds like 'Tarantino' film now! Django, played by Jamie Fox, is a slave during the pre-Civil war period who is set free by a German dentist and bounty hunter going by the name of Mr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz, who appears so overwhelmed during his award speeches it's a marvel to watch him playing such nonchalant, crafty characters). The German bounty hunter teams up with Django in tracking down (and in all cases, taken down quite brutally) wrongdoers and hunting down the Brittle Brothers who had once owned Django and his wife Broomhilda von Shaft. When the two realize that Broomhilda is in possession of a dangerously and deviously profligate plantation owner Candie (a deadly portrayal by Leonardo DiCaprio), both try to rescue her by duping Candie. But Candie has his own right-hand man, the terrifying senior house slave Stephen (Samuel Jackson, whose appearance caused an excited frenzy among the audiences) who can smell something fishy in Mr. Schultz and Django's offer and tries to find out whether the slave trade offer is what they have come for.It does not require rocket-science to figure out how Django Unchained will progress; after every bounty kill, you have a conversation between Django and Mr. Schultz about what do, where to head next, Django's wife, German folklore etc, mostly taking place at nighttime in lonely rocky areas. And every segment takes longer to end than the previous one until the climax, so the longest duration is spent on the Candie segment. The weapon used is either a shotgun or rifle (you see the insides spluttering out) and a whip in one flashback sequence, but the violence is only marginal compared to Tarantino brings once the Candie segment begins. Then you get a disturbing and sadistic fights, shooting and more shooting \u2013and Tarantino keeps the camera very close to the action so you can get to see blood splashing out as bullets pierce bodies.Critics have a great number of reasons to attack a movie like this, but they don't and the reason for this is same that we heard from Tarantino himself in his smug Oscar acceptance speech: \"My films have great characters\". I'd add 'and great conversations on topics you would hardly hear in conventional movies'. Who would have thought that keeping a seven-ten minute sequence of Candie monologuing with a skull (like Hamlet) of the previous head slave, about blacks remaining slaves because of the higher composition of 'servile' matter in their brain, would be one of the most memorable sequences from the film? Had any other director read this sequence in the script, he would've most probably laughed at it. But Tarantino is one who knows how to make these sequences work, and so he gives us such a depraved and egregious character like Candie to mouth the words that we instantly find it believable.Unchained is not emotionally as gripping as Kill Bill, and one reason may be that the protagonist here is a male slave who has seen so much wrong that he is almost apathetic to an extent. But I did feel that Foxx took more time to get in character than Kerry Washington, who's far more convincing as the beaten-and-broken Broomhilda. You love how subtly Christoph Waltz conveys his character's tension inwardly when Candie learns of his plan, trying his best not to show his weakness yet you hear is usually-confident voice drop to a whisper. DiCaprio has the mien of Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter and mind of Alex from Clockwork Orange, and the actor's detractors who complain that he's acting in the same manner in his recent roles will shut up after watching Candie (unless they want Candie to batter their skulls!).Django Unchained's a little too long and some scenes stretch out too much (like the handshake scene between Schultz and Candie): Tony Kushner's script is a tad more worthy of the Oscar than Tarantino's. Yet Tarantino is one director from whom you'll always expect the unexpected, and Django is one badass motherf**ker film.",

So I have no yoke to bear when I say that Quentin Tarantino's \"Django Unchained\" is the best Western I've ever seen.The title character is a pre-Civil War slave (Jamie Foxx) freed by a conniving bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christopher Waltz), so that Schultz can hunt down three outlaws only Django can identify. In the midst of this task, Schultz discovers that Django is married to Broomhilda (Kerri Washington), a slave trapped on an infamously brutal plantation named Candieland. Schultz then sets about freeing Broomhilda and reuniting her with Django.Writer-director Tarantino's calling card is his lack of political correctness, and that's on full display here. Tarantino merges two way-out-there genres, the spaghetti Western and the blaxploitation flick, to depict ignorant white slave-owners getting what's coming to them.Violence-wise, the movie is bathed in blood. The movie also pulls no punches language-wise, dotting its dialogue with the infamous N-word as much as possible. Because of this, many feel that \"Django's\" treats its raw subject matter \u2013 brutal slavery in the South \u2013 too lightly and gratuitously.I don't agree. \"Django Unchained\" is no \"Blazing Saddles.\" Look at the character of Stephen, a Candieland slave who is all Uncle Tom on the surface but is actually the brains behind the plantation. Samuel L. Jackson goes all-out to show Stephen as a slave who has triumphed over his Deep South origins and isn't about to let anyone, white or black, upset the status quo.I think Tarantino is getting at something here. By showing the ignorance and evil of all who willingly let slavery continue, \"Django\" is giving us the flip side of ultra-reverent Southern epics such as \"Gone with the Wind\" \u2013 and about time, too. \"Django Unchained\" is surely not historically accurate, but when it shows moronic slave-owners getting their just desserts, it's deliciously satisfying.",

And along the way, he agrees to help free his wife... but that will not be easy, because she is being held by the flamboyant Calvin Candie(DiCaprio, playing it as an insidious psycho, shining in his first villain role, and shattering his fluffy, romantic image utterly; at one point, he caressed a horse, and it literally sent a chill down my spine... that is how despicable he is), and his \"spy\", Stephen(Jackson, as a manipulative traitor to his ethnicity), and they are not to be taken lightly. This is tense throughout, with us constantly worrying that our titular anti-hero(who is soft-spoken, both fulfilling the spaghetti Western trope and convincing you that he's been kept down his entire life) will suddenly just draw his gun and unload on the awful people abusing his kind - we know that they outnumber him, and that is not the way to successfully accomplish it. The action is incredibly tightly packed when it is there(keep in mind that this is a drama-thriller), and the rest of the time, we're either expecting it to erupt any minute, or catching our breath. Humor is impeccable, and I spent more than most of the 2 hour, 44 minutes(not counting end credits; ever self-indulgent, and could have been cut down to less? Sure. And the pacing does suffer a little, all entirely forgivable if you're into the director) of the running time doing one of three things: tapping my foot to the music(including both Ennio Morricone *and* modern rap music... and yes, somehow, it's always perfectly fitting; the mix of very different cultural elements is complementary), laughing uproariously, or with my heart pounding. It's shot beautifully on film, capturing every detail of the carefully designed props, costumes, sets, and the gorgeous exteriors, including snowy mountains. Tarantino(who packs minor roles with cameos from people we've seen in other of his pictures, and everyone cast looks the part, with unknowns missing teeth or speaking in a strange accent(the Southern is strong in this one) imbues this with his usual wordy, quotable dialog, though not much chronological jumping or complex plotting. There is pervasive graphic violence(brutal and bloody, highly unpleasant and disturbing to watch... not only because of the subject matter, although that does make it appropriate... well played, Quentin) and language(not big on the N-word? It's every fourth of fifth word spoken, here), and brief nudity(full frontal male, and topless female) in this. I recommend this to any big fan of his(if you only \"like\" his films, wait for a rental... and those who don't already enjoy his work need not apply at all). 10/10",

But I was left disappointed by the end which is too messy and spoils everything. It is as if Tarantino had wanted to outperform all of his previous bloodbaths and it is regrettable. There could have been, for a change something a little more sober from this director. An other thing that bothers me in this movie is the cynicism towards the way Black people are forced to play the game of the slave owners. It culminate in yet another crude display of violence which is, at the very least, disturbing.",

Samuel Jackson's role is just another movie for him to be in. As far as using slavery as a plot i would rather see more serious depictions in movies that enlighten us and drive us to improve our outlook toward a better future. The difference between Inglorious Basterds and this movie is that we do not have a race of people that we still have a derogatory word that is harming us as people. The N word is old in Quinton's movies and why do we still use it to make millions at the box office. Not really a great movie. Lets see if Quinton has it in him to do a movie without needing two hours of the N word.",

            "review_title": "A demented, violent, sometimes-thought-provoking-but-always-entertaining film, \"Django Unchained\" is one of Tarantino's best...",
            "content": "The thing that surprised me about \"Django Unchained\", the newest film from cinematic madman and mastermind Quentin Tarantino, was the fact that underneath the dialog, the stylish direction, the incredible humor and the heart-stopping (but few and far between) action set-pieces was that it was an oddly thought provoking film, particularly when it comes to just who the villain is, and their motivations. While I will not spoil anything here, the truth is, the real adversary of the film may not be the white plantation owner that Django is struggling against, but a far different character.Tarantino's new film is very deep in many ways, to be honest, whether it be within the context of the film itself, of the references Tarantino uses from his deep-seeded love and admiration of films and filmmaking. Like all of his other works, it's a labor of love. Starring Jamie Foxx, Christophe Waltz, Leonardo Di Caprio and Samuel L. Jackson, among others, it is a bizarre ode to the Western genre, blending different styles and genres in the process of telling it's 2+ hour tale.Foxx stars as Django, a slave who is liberated by Dr. King Schultz (Waltz), a German-born former-dentist who now works as a bounty hunter in the US. Schultz hopes to use Django's knowledge of the Brittle Brothers, criminals working on a plantation (and Django's former owners), to catch them and collect their bounty. After assisting Schultz in dispatching the brothers, the two continue to work together as bounty hunters, as Schultz promises to help Django find his wife, whom was sold to another plantation owner.Eventually, Django and Schultz track Django's wife Broomhilda to the plantation of a bizarre, violent but charming man named Calvin Candie (Di Caprio). Through a series of twists, turns and increasingly raised stakes, the stage is set for a final, brutal showdown between Django and Schultz, and Candie and his men. (Including a fiercely loyal and disturbing slave named Stephen, played in a scene-stealing performance by Samuel L. Jackson.)The film is a marvel from everything on screen and behind the scenes. The acting is uniformly triumphant. Foxx plays the role of Django with a deep-seeded darkness yet also a style and even slight glee at times as he is given the opportunity to break free of his chains (both proverbial and literal) and do something to fight back against his life of oppression. Waltz shines once again after having broken through in Tarantino's previous film, and delivers another grandiose, memorable character, proving to be one of the finest actors working today. Di Caprio shines as the disturbing Calvin Candie, giving us a role unlike anything we have seen before. And Samuel L. Jackson gives the best performance of the picture, even though his role is comparatively smaller than the others, making Stephen a complex, unforgettable, hilarious yet still oddly disturbing and terrifying \"villain of sorts.\" All supporting roles (including roles by Walton Goggins, Kerry Washinton, Don Jonhson and others) are played equally as marvelous as the main cast.Tarantino's direction takes a quantum leap forward. While he had explored action before in features like \"Kill Bill\" and \"Death Proof\", here, he shows just how much of a visual artist he is, providing us with not only complexly thought-out scenes of dialog and development, but also some of the most intense sequences of action and gunfire I've ever seen. One standout sequence (which is so intense, the walls literally drip with spilled blood) is arguably in the running for the best on-screen shoot-out of the decade. His script work and writing is as strong as ever, and the dialog shines as always. This film is another example of just how much of a cinematic genius Tarantino truly is. All other facets of the film, from the costume design to the cinematography are also top-notch.This film, to me, is among Tarantino's best. While it may not reach the demented genius of \"Pulp Fiction\", it's an outstanding revenge tale, filled with love and respect for cinema, and featuring memorable characters, outstanding performances, applause-worthy action and genuine, honest-to-god, butt-kicking \"filmmaking.\"I give \"Django Unchained\" a 10 out of 10. See it. Now.",

But I've long resisted watching Django Unchained as it is sandwiched between two bags of tripe (Hateful Eight & Inglorious Basterds, also reviewed).Django Unchained is, like all Tarantino films: a comedy. It lifts from and pays homage to the great westerns, even to their soundtracks. It's highly entertaining, with larger than life characters. It sets up and takes aim at caricatures of the American south and the evils of slavery. For this I am quite sure that Tarantino received bags of hate mail. But this is what he does - he antagonises - specifically using \"American icons\", just because he can, attacks stereotypes, just because he wants to.Django Unchained rightly won Oscars. Foxx is excellent as the smouldering freed slave on a quest. Waltz is even better - collecting the Oscar. Great action, a great-looking film, and a brilliant soundtrack contribution for Morricone.

            "content": "Django Unchained is a movie that captivates your interest from the very beginning, I have seen nice intros for movie protagonist, but the one Quentin Tarantino dished out for Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is one I will not forget that easily because after I saw that I was hooked and looked forward to seeing how the movie was going to play out. The great thing about this nearly 3 hours movie is that, never a dull moment. The lead actors (Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio) were just too good, that you looked forward to see them each time. Django Unchained I can boldly say lived up to the hype that it claimed, a beautiful action pack movie for all (above 17) to see.Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and released on Christmas Day of 2012, the movie is said to be set two years before the American Civil War. Tarantino, got inspiration for the film from Sergio Corbucci 1966 movie Django and also inspiration was also gotten from the 1975 film Mandingo. After Tarantino was done with the script, the Weinstein Company picked it up for production with 83 million dollars, casting Jamie Foxx in the lead role.The movie is about love and revenge; the two most deadly forces collide in this movie. Django (Jamie Foxx) was a slave being taken to be sold, when a bounty hunter approached the men that were taken him and started questioning the slaves to see who knew some men he was hunting, Django knew them and after some unforeseen circumstances both roll out as bounty hunters.Django only wanted one thing and that is to free his wife, but in order to be able to free his wife they have to fool Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and this must be done while the heavily suspicious Steven (Samuel L. Jackson) is watching.The movie isn't all sunshine, there were some let downs, like the intensive violence were sometimes unneeded, the heavy use of the word \"Nigger\" may not go down well with some and I guess if you are one for history, the depiction of slavery as a western shootout may not go down well with you. The time of slavery were hard times not gun slinging times.Putting that aside Django Unchained is a good movie one you will enjoy. It also got an accolade from The American Film Institute; they included the movie in their Top Ten Movies of the Year in December 2012.www.lagsreviews.com",

            "review_title": "Another Great Tarantino Film. Who Knew?",
            "content": "Django Unchained is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and follows a slave named Django, played by Jamie Foxx. While Django, and some other slaves, were on their way to their new \"masters\" plantation, a German bounty hunter named Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) stops the traveling slaves and collects Django due to his knowledge of what three wanted slave owners look like. During the process of hunting these three men, Django and Dr. Schultz go on a journey to save Django's wife, who's a slave living on a Mississippi plantation owned by the evil Calvin Candie (Leonardo Dicaprio).Being written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, I had high hopes for Django Unchained, yet I was still surprised in almost every way. The acting, direction, script, score, and pacing all make Django Unchained a phenomenal movie, and a very enjoyable one at that. At its three hour run time, Django Unchained never stops, or even slows down, at all. Every single minute of this film keeps going, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.Rarely does a film have a perfect script. However, in the case of Django Unchained, the script is nothing short of flawless. Every single line of dialogue is perfectly written, with thoughts of what has and what will happen throughout the film. The banter between characters, particularly Dr. Schultz and Django, is both compelling and hilarious at the same time. Each line amazingly builds suspense for what is about to come in the next scene, and the next, and so on. The script is truly fantastic, and is the best thing about Django Unchained, which is saying a lot.The acting is also incredible. Jamie Foxx gives the performance of a life time, portraying one of the best character arcs in cinematic history. Towards the beginning of the film, Django is still a slave, and he doesn't know whether or not he should respond to white men most of the time. However, he eventually learns that he is no less than any white man, and begins to buy nicer clothing, and talk back (both respectfully and sarcastically) to white men, and becomes his own person, complete with memorable lines and a sly, bad tone to his voice.Christoph Waltz gives one of the best supporting actor performances of all time, with great sarcasm and hilarious dialogue. Many of the lines Waltz delivered had me gut-busted laughing, thanks to both the actor and the astounding script. Leonardo Dicaprio actually gives one of the best performances of his career, playing the polite, yet ficious, Calvin Candie. His character is cruel, and has no conscience about anything he does (involving his slaves, at least), and Dicaprio plays this menace brilliantly.Samuel L. Jackson is actually in this movie, and he plays one of Candie's slaves, yet he's somehow \"above\" all of the other slaves due to his abundance of time spent on Candie's plantation, self titled Candieland. He orders the other slaves, and even some white men, around, and uses the \"n\" word a lot. Samuel L. Jackson, of course, is amazing in this role, partly due to Tarantino writing it with him in mind.The direction, also by Tarantino, is unexplainably fascinating. The direction reeks of older styles, with a newer vibe mixed in as well. There are many moments where the camera will zoom in twenty feet from a far off shot straight into a close up of a character's face. These great directing styles add an interesting aspect to the entire film, and make it look very nice as well. The action is also filmed very nicely, with no shaky cam or quick cuts. Each of the ridiculously violent blood splatters from a bullet wound is shown without hesitation, which adds a grotesque, yet revealing, side to Django Unchained.The score, composed by Ennio Morricone, is also exhilarating. Each main character has his own theme, from Django to Candie, and the score gives a distinct feel to each character. The smart choice of including older western songs in the film also added to the great feel of the film. Each time Django does some \"awesome\" act that's noteworthy, music accompanies him as he rides off into the next scene, and makes the viewer want to pat him on the back and ride off with him.The only issue that I could see some making for Django Unchained is the run time. Although the run time is a bit long, I ask those people: what scenes would you cut out of the film? There isn't any. The run time is lengthy, yes, but the story of Django is a long one to tell, so all support to Tarantino for making the film as long as he saw fit, because if it was any shorter, people would complain about its rushed script and plot holes, so I see the run time as fit at three hours.Overall, Django Unchained is a fantastic film, with great direction, acting, music, and a flawless script. I'd recommend Django Unchained to anyone who can handle the over the top violence, because there is a lot.",

The second time I thought it was a good movie. But now, after several years, I think it is a marvelous movie. It was like watching it for the first time and the experience was outstanding. This is what a movie should be like. It is so powerful in every aspect. I have been a fan of QT for more than 15 years and I think that he is just becoming better and better. He is such a complete artist. In my modest opinion, few directors are able to make such an extravagant movie, with the combination of disturbing and hilarious scenes, with ridiculous clothes and mannerisms, and yet so profound and overwhelming. The emotional weight was enormous. Only a true visionary can pack all these elements into an unforgettable experience. Every word, every sigh, every look, every piece of dialogue is masterfully positioned to evoke the viewer's feelings and to enable them to be completely immersed in this epic piece of art. The music and the acting are on another level. I can't even think of how to describe it. With such vision, talent, knowledge, sensibility, and intuition, QT is capable to breathe life into characters and to make them immortal. I have never completely understood Tarantino's words that his dialogue carries emotion, but now I do. Performances are so strong, so genuine, and given with 100% devotion. Because of the ability to bring the best out of his actors, this movie has just established the greatness of Jamie, Washington, DiCaprio, Waltz, and of course, Jackson. One of the most memorable things to me is Jamie's acting when he hears about or sees Hildi's suffering. It so well written, so perfectly executed, it shows how strong is his pain on one hand, and how high is his control on the other. The one thing that ties the whole movie together is the song Freedom. This is one of the best uses of a song in a movie, a stroke of genius. Not only it carries the weight of terrible lives, but it also haunts you and reminds you what hell they had to go through. From an existential and a therapeutic point of view, the song and the movie convey the message of human life itself. How we live our whole lives in some kind of captivity, how we can easily give in and abandon our search for meaning and autonomy. Even though it's a theme of revenge, the movie, and especially Jamie Foxx, shows us the strength and drive that are innate to us, but many times are forgotten. It is not just a story about killing a bunch of people, it is a tale of great suffering that is inescapable, and a tale about how life shapes us, transforms us, and leads us in many unexpected ways. True art doesn't answer questions, it asks questions, it stimulates you to think, and it helps you to experience feelings that stay with you for a long time. For me, this is an example of true art.",

A symphony of deception, tension, and ultra- violence, Django Unchained is a classic Tarantino flick with deep with memorable characters, a great story and memorable moments galore.While the cast is all incredibly well done (Sam Jackson is hilariously cheeky, DiCaprio is the perfect ultra villain, and Foxx is surprisingly good as the lead) Christoph Waltz gets all the props for his character, Dr. King Schultz. Equal parts lovable and hilarious, this is my character of the year.Action is sparse but when it happens it is meaningful and packs a wallop. This is one over the top film! Soundtrack is good too, but the only memorable piece is the main theme. Django also has some beautiful cinematography as well.Tarantino also goes out of his way to make Candie an ultra villain and depict the horrors of slavery in his own wacky style. It's brutal and not for the faint of heart, but it gets the job done and is a surprisingly adept commentary on the evils of slavery. I did feel Django lag at some points, and the movie was a little overly long, with a final chunk that was a little anti-climatic for its own good. Also, it would've been great to see Schultz and Django's bounty hunting mis-adventures having more screen time than Candyland, but that's just because the chemistry was perfect between the two.That aside, Tarantino delivers once again. I'd say Inglorious Basterds is better, but not by much. Very memorable characters, a classic story, and bursts of spot on humor make Django very enjoyable and fun watch.

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's eighth feature is a meandering rescue and revenge tale set in an overtly racist pre-Civil War Deep South. It concerns the slave Django (Jamie Foxx) and his bounty hunter emancipator King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), building up wealth by whacking lawbreakers, before setting their sights on plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), who's keeping Django's wife (Kerry Washington) as a \"comfort girl\".There is a fantastic performance from Waltz, who starts off playing the flip-side of his verbose Nazi Hans Landa, but then actually develops emotionally throughout the narrative - a rare arc for a Tarantino film. Foxx looks the part, although he's too soft-spoken. The words are written like they should be fired off like a six-shooter, but he sings them soulfully. Samuel L. Jackson, all bent limbs and glaring eyes, transforms remarkably into the sycophantic Stephen, the crow on Candie's shoulder; which brings us to the real revelation, DiCaprio, playing against type as the caricatured boy-emperor, ignorant and excitable, vicious as a child pulling the legs off insects.Once Django and Schultz arrive at Candieland the film moves from Jeremiah Johnson-style landscape wandering to an enclosed, nightmarish theatre piece. The effect is quite disconcerting. (It's just a pity that the film then emerges from the Big House, escapes, returning for another ending.) As usual, Tarantino's dialogue, when it works, is lyrical and amusingly precise.The film's problems are a matter of discipline. There is an unusually high quota of dud moments, like when a mob of white supremacists argue endlessly about the eye-holes in their hoods. It's a one-line joke stretched to five minutes of screen-time. Later, a climactic shootout turns out to be a pre-pre-climactic shootout, bridged with a horrifying cameo by the auteur himself, bizarrely adopting an Australian accent, sounding like Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Indulgence can be a part of the pleasure of Tarantino's films, but sometimes it is to their detriment.With its movie theatre setting, Inglourious Basterds was a film about film; about the depiction of good and evil on screen, and our relationship with heroes and villains (the cruellest character in that film was also the most seductive). Seeing the eyes of Eli Roth glowing red with the blood of his foe was troubling, because it made us question the pleasure we derive from watching evil punished. Django is more simplistic, building a cast of ogres mostly too dumb to rationalise their bigotry, unquestionably deserving of being chopped down. We desire a release. We are given it. The effect is briefly thrilling, but it's also a bit banal.",

From Reservoir Dogs on, I've seen every single Tarantino release in the theaters. This is the first time my friends had to carry me out - literally sleeping.Django starts off well enough, with a great opening salvo that locks down the Oscar for Cristopher Waltz in about 15 minutes. But after an hour, the script starts to drag, and the snappy one-liners disappear. By the time DiCaprio and Samuel Jackson enter, the movie is effectively on life support. Neither can save it, with the plot spelled out and the pace gone. The death knell comes from Waltz, who has to relinquish his lead role to the good - but not great - Jamie Foxx. Foxx is promptly sent into a revenge-by-the-numbers routine we've seen several times from Tarantino.Which is where I fell asleep. In the end, Django gets bonus points for its clever tackle of a tricky subject, and for a first hour that ranks among the most entertaining I've seen this year. But it's not in the league of Inglourious Basterds, which isn't in the league of Jackie Brown, which isn't in the league of Pulp Fiction.",

            "content": "Written and directed by the one and only Quentin Tarantino, \"Django Unchained\" is a spaghetti western satire set in the South, during the time of slavery. But at it's scope, this is yet another gruesomely violent, expertly written, and incredibly entertaining masterpiece from the man that brought us \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Reservoir Dogs\". Jamie Foxx stars as the title character, an African-American slave who is suddenly freed by a former dentist turned bounty-hunter, played by Christoph Waltz, whom turns Django in as a bounty-hunter, as they both team up to track down and kill some of the town's biggest menaces for a quick reward. During their progress, these two hunters then set out to help free Django's enslaved wife, played by Kerry Washington, from the clutches of a villainous plantation owner, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his trusted house slave, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Everything about this movie is what you already would have expected in a film by Tarantino. The witty and well-written dialogue, the certain choices of soundtrack, and the incredible directing are all nothing but masterful, as the accomplished director delivers yet another masterpiece in his long-life career as a filmmaker. Say whatever you want about his personal life, but this is one of Hollywood's most beloved filmmakers, delivering such a love for cinema in nearly every film he makes. Now, this movie might create controversy with some viewers, as it delivers more uses of the \"N-word\" in any film ever, and to make things even more disturbing, it's used in a film where the main topic involves the era of slavery. Tarantino was not trying to glorify any of the brutal attacks or language portrayed in the film, but instead uses it as a way to recreate the environment of that time in history, and how it affects people today. But, while you can still take the topic of slavery seriously, this is also one of the funniest movies of 2012. Just like in all of his films, the humor just gets better and better, making the movie a lot more entertaining all on it's own. Appearing in yet another Tarantino performance, after his Oscar-winning work in \"Inglourious Basterds\", Christoph Waltz delivers another convincing performance, still succeeds at delivering great Tarantino dialogue. His recent Oscar nomination for this film is rightfully deserving, but it's strange that he was put in the supporting category, when he has more screen-time than anyone else in the film. Jamie Foxx is just as remarkable as the former slave turned bounty-hunter, delivering some of the film's most memorable moments. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers one of the most menacing performances of his career, and he's easily the most interesting character. It's a real shame that he was snubbed by the Academy for his vicious but charismatic performance as Calvin Candie, a ruthless plantation owner. Tarantino favorite Samuel L. Jackson also delivers a hilarious performance as Calvin's only trusted house slave, as he suddenly suspects what business those these two people need in their plantation. At a pace of 165 minutes, I would argue that the movie does run a little bit long, but the movie takes it's time very well, and it always keeps your attention. This is an incredibly well-made, and definitely entertaining feast that only true film lovers will enjoy. From the first shot, to the final bloody climax, \"Django Unchained\" is one of 2012's best films. \"Django Unchained\", in my review, \"wickedly entertaining, good old-fashioned Tarantino\".",

            "content": "DJANGO UNCHAINED (4/5)Please visit - http://iamalekhya.blogspot.com'DJANGO UNCHAINED' is a kick-ass entertainer!Like any other Tarantino film, it has a tinseled appeal and bold sentimentality, embroidered with mind-blowing acts from all its actors.Set in the eighteenth-century era of the Deep South and Old West, the film trails an unbound slave (Jamie Foxx) who treks across the United States with a bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) on a task to rescue his wife (Kerry Washington) from a harsh and alluring plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio).Unlike other Tarantino flicks, which are portrayed in chapters, Django Unchained has a linear narrative. It reliably rotates around the two characters, played by Foxx and Waltz, who share practical aims. With a runtime of quarter to three hours, the film could've been a dull watch, but the screenplay is so captivating that never do you comprehend the length. Tarantino gives you one attractive scene after the other, keeping you deeply absorbed in the whole drama. In addition to this, the humor and brazen-faced style is consistently upheld to make the proceedings even more delectable. The writing is immaculate, although, it isn't as shrewd as his preceding film, 'IngloriousBastards'. Each character is sketched so beautifully that it leaves a permanent mark on the audience.There are scenes that make you laugh, like the one where in the middle of chasing Django and Dr. Schultz, the masked goons fight over the silly issue of who made such clumsy masks. In fact, Jamie Foxx's crude style and attitude, while shooting, or horse-riding, or even while just silently looking, are respectfully mirthful every single time. Then there are raw action scenes filled with blood and gore, and some disturbing depictions of slavery prevailing in the region during the era presented. It touches some really sensitive issues of slavery of the dark-skinned, albeit, upholding the playful flavor of the film. Everything, right from the sets, to the costumes and dialogues seems absolutely authentic.Now coming to the performances, since it's a Tarantino film, it goes without saying that the performances are impeccable. Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Dicaprio, Samuel Jackson, Kerry Washington and others are totally apt. But it's Christoph Waltz who shines the brightest. His demeanor is truly magnetic and dialogues, delightfully written as well as delivered. He truly deserves the Oscar he was awarded with.Tout ensemble, Django Unchained is wildly extravagant, ferociously violent and outrageously entertaining. Those who hate blood gore and action might not relish it, but a \"Must Watch\" for all Tarantino fans! Rating: 4/5",

It's terrible for people to be sold as slaves because of their race, but for them to be treated so inhumanely is unacceptable! I don't know to what extent of the movie was accurate for that time, but it definitely opened my eyes. The way Dr. Shultz treated Django was so amazing, considering everyone else just considered Django a \"Nigger\", and why was a \"Nigger\" riding a horse? Constantly having to explain that he was a \"Free-Man\". I hope Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz get recognized for their ability in this movie. Oh, and did I mention Leonardo DiCaprio? WOW... he played \"Monsieur Candie\", very believably. I will admit, I could have done without his sister.I'm not a huge Quentin Tarrantino fan because of the violence in his movies, but this western was amazing....the story, the acting, \"Oh My Goodness\".

I also agree with many who have written reviews on here about the egregious racism (white and black) in this movie. I understand it is Tarantino and it is supposed to be over the top; but it really just seemed like a lot of unbridled race-bating (either way, black and white) to me. None of it was funny or entertaining. Why would you want to depict a person being eaten alive by dogs or (almost) being castrated by a hot poker? Would it be entertaining/funny if someone did those things to you? It is very disturbing to me that this film is so critically acclaimed: I think it is a reflection of how out of control our society is right now.This movie so deeply disturbed me that I went through the trouble to create an IMDb account specifically to come on here and rate it as a 1.

            "content": "I just got back from seeing DJANGO UNCHAINED, and I thought it was Very Good, and one of Quentin Tarantino's best. But what I really enjoyed most were the strong performances and vivid characterizations -- Jamie Foxx as the determined slave Django, but even more so his partner Christoph Waltz, who is exceptional yet again (I loved his good-hearted character Schultz here). I never thought I would ever enjoy Leonardo DiCaprio in anything, but I thought he was remarkably villainous in DJANGO. Samuel Jackson was truly excellent, I thought, the first time we see him in the part of an aged house servant ... but it seemed like his elderly and slow-moving character rejuvenated a little more each time we saw him later (at least this was my initial impression). And a big surprise was a short-lived yet highly entertaining tour de force by Don Johnson!I'd say the movie could have been nearly perfect if not for a feel of lagging and overstaying itself in the last 20 + minutes or so for me. I felt disappointed in the direction things went in the final act(s) or so, pretty much after Waltz and Leonardo finally conclude their transaction. And some of the last bits with Michael Parks again showing up to make the same trademark gestures he's already used in other films like KILL BILL, and Quentin himself (who's starting to appear more like \"Tubby\" Tarantino) compromising the proceedings yet again with another self-indulgent and needless cameo, well -- I could have skipped those.Just a word about the \"racism\" we've been hearing around some camps (like from the delusional Spike Lee). This movie depicts language and attitudes the way they were in those unfortunate and misguided times, and nobody's saying or doing anything that probably wasn't actually said and done (and worse) back then. But more than that, the Tarantino twist here is that it's the slaves who get to settle the score. The movie is an \"up yours!\" to the slave keepers of that period. And sure, there is violence which is some places is overly gratuitous for the story we're involved with. But I think the gore and action is of secondary interest to the real appeal of the film for me: which is the friendship between Django (Jamie Foxx) and Schultz (Waltz), and their dedication to one another. The movie is also humorous in places, but never overly so. ***1/2 out of ****",

            "content": "For some time now Django Unchained has had my curiosity...now that I've witnessed its spectacle, it has my undivided attention. Quentin Tarantino's latest endeavour takes us into his fictional historical tale of the deep south of the United States in the antebellum era. There are endless, near indescribable qualities that the modern spaghetti western remarkably presents. Everything Tarantino wants to accomplish, he achieves. If the director/writer means for you to laugh, you will laugh. If it's fun he's after, prepare to be entertained. In regards to emotion, for some, a spare Kleenex may be required to endure the brutality of slavery that has not been explored in such a graphic, yet ludicrously stylish manner in cinematic history.Never before have I wanted a hero to achieve so much in any fictional narrative. Our protagonist Django, so marvellously portrayed by Jamie Foxx, coincidently is released from the oppressive and immoral shackles of slavery by Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in the opening scene of the film, and following the incredible introductions of these characters, they set out on an interdependent journey of bounty hunting, self-discovery and most importantly, the reuniting of Django and his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). I haven't really divulged anything that can't be ascertained from the trailer or synopsis of the western drama. Nonetheless, one cathartic response to Django Unchained that can only be obtained by actually going to experience the film in theatres is how much we relate and adore our heroic free man. When he cries, we cry. His desire for vengeance is our desire. Tarantino is not trying to create the most realist representation of antebellum slavery, but in fact provide a horrific account of the suffering that occurred in the unjust south. Though as I said, when the visionary filmmaker wants to entertain, he will entertain. For the most part, slavery and oppression are the consistent and ever-present motifs throughout the almost three hour film, and yet the outstanding performances, inconceivably sophisticated dialogue, beautiful cinematography, fantastic soundtrack, unpredictable plot and visual masterpiece enthral, excite and provide comedic relief at perfectly allocated times. Django Unchained almost has everything; spectacularly choreographed action, a great narrative, an intriguing setting, emotion, memorable quotes and character development are all present and appreciated thoroughly.The performances are almost beyond belief. The assimilation of this sensational cast, along with one of the greatest filmmakers and a talented crew, make for a theatrical experience that revives any doubts you may have on the power of motion picture performances. I cannot think of another film whereby deciding who my favourite character is makes me feel guilty for not choosing the others who are just as brilliant. Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson and Kerry Washington not only play convincing characters, they convinced me I was with them in antebellum Mississippi due to the life, emotion and realism they bring to their respective and truly memorably distinctive roles. While we are supposed to root for our victims of the oppressive society and we certainly do, the antagonists Calvin Candie (DiCaprio) and his slave Stephen (Jackson) are nothing short of exceptional and intriguing to watch. The costume design is wonderful, the sets and locations the characters occupy are wondrous and as soon as you depart from your cinema seat, which you won't forget sitting in, you will find yourself being unable to replace the characters with other actors. Not only the primary characters, but the supporting cast are also irreplaceable and unforgettable to a perpetual degree.To those that regard Django Unchained as a Hollywood product of solely racial profanity and excessive violence, I say I respect your opinion, but do not be afraid of reality. The film embarks on the pinnacle time of white supremacy in the United States and while it sensationalises much of its content, the topic of slavery is not one that can ever be fully comprehended or physically depicted by those that have not lived through it. Therefore, Tarantino's work should be admired for its confidence to approach such a sensitive, serious and often overshadowed element of American and world history.At the risk of exhausting an abundance of synonyms for optimistic adjectives to express my adoration for Quentin Tarantino's phenomenal work of genius, I will bring my literary opinion of Django Unchained to a conclusion. I could persist and continue writing endlessly, which I would indeed find very enjoyable, though I have highlighted the fundamental aspects of the film that create my love for it. This isn't just the finest Tarantino has to offer, it is one of the most epic productions that the world of cinema has to offer. Though many were gifted with Django Unchained on Christmas Day, for me, the film has sparked a potentially inconceivable swarm of hopefully terrific films for the 2013 cinematic year, though I doubt any release will match the originality and style that Tarantino has gifted upon the world.",

Be warned there is a lot of violent parts and brutal torture scenes but we have both been to several of the plantations around New Orleans and read up on what happened at most of them and based on the knowledge we gleaned quite frankly if anything the graphic scenes are toned down a lot. It has an 18 rating for good reason not that the violence is gratuitous in my opinion. I personally think the film could have been improved if it had been longer but apart from that what is included is extremely entertaining. My friend and I ran the gamut of emotions throughout this creation and in our experience that usually means a cracking spectacle.

That is how excited I have been for this movie since I heard about it. I was glad to have watched this two weeks prior to its release date. There are just so many things I absolutely loved the hell out about this film. The opening introductions as the credits roll in was just giving me goosebumps from someone who loved Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill 1 and 2. I adore Tarantino's work and find his movies very entertaining. Django Unchained had that extremely brilliant start to the film that I loved. As Christoph Waltz's Dr. King Schultz walks up to the slaves, I was already loving the film. There was something about the film that I absolutely loved. Aside from enjoying Western movies like the Dollars trilogy, Tarantino's dialogue in this movie is extremely moving and just a joy to watch. The story is very interesting and never really falls away from being an ABSOLUTE BLAST! The story is as simple as a freed slave on a quest to Candyland to get back his wife who is now under the control of a man called Calvin Candy. I absolutely loved the different unique Western story that Tarantino brought into this movie for every right reason in the world. The acting was phenomenal by Samuel L Jackson, who was plain amazing in the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio was just unbelievable finally playing a much darker character. Christoph Waltz was also fantastic. In fact, these three stole every single scene they were in and Samuel L Jackson pretty much made the movie a more than complete experience. Its interesting that Will Smith was originally casted for Django but I felt disappointed that they hadn't chosen him but in the end, Jamie Foxx was unbelievable as Django! The music and soundtrack in the movie is brilliant as usual by Tarantino standards and the violence is just a pleasure to watch. These are amongst Tarantino's most fascinating characters but still they cannot compete with the characters in Pulp Fiction. This movie is absolutely entertaining. If I look at this as a 2012 movie, this just edged past the Hobbit as the best film of 2012! Absolutely plain awesome!",

(And I really liked Unforgiven).Before the film even starts we get a taste of all the things we love about Quentin, as the Columbia logo is made to look retro. We then get some great pastiche titles over some terrific shots of a chain of slaves walking across the desert and into a forest. Of course we are then graced by the devastating presence of Christoph Waltz, who has a humorously over-sized tooth on his dentist waggon. Christoph gives us yet again another impeccable performance as our bounty-hunter hero, proving that he can make as good a hero as his wonderful villain in Inglorious Basterds.The first sequence is gloriously engaging and entertaining, as we delve right into the plot with Christoph buying Django straight away, and of course it's not quite that simple... From then on we have a string of compelling moments as we watch the pair, who make a marvellous, funny and often touching double act, go on a bounty hunt with some of it even for revenge, which is a theme I'm very keen on! However, things get kicked up another notch when Django and Shultz decide to go and rescue Django's wife who's been kidnapped by the deliriously evil, Calvin Candie (what a great name!)Leonardo Di Caprio puts on a great performance as Calvin, who appears sneaky and calculated, like all the best villains. However, Leo does take a terrifyingly intense turn when Calvin gets angry! It's a pretty intense sequence where Leo actually does draw real blood! Now that's some powerful acting. Of course, the dialogue is tight and suspenseful and hopefully Quentin is pretty much guaranteed to win the Oscar for best original screenplay. The film is packed full of tension when the duo are with Calvin, and the suspense only rises at dinner-time which escalates into exactly the wild west shootout I was hoping for.There's a sequence that is almost matching of Kill Bill Vol.1 where there's gallons of blood flying around! It's madly entertaining to watch and possibly one of the greatest scenes ever! Quentin has created two brilliant heroes who we can root for and care about. The flashback sequences with Django and his wife really involves you in the story, and some of them are rather emotional. I was almost as filled as much rage as Django when he first saw his wife being ill-treated, and just like Kill Bill I couldn't wait to see Django and Shultz exact revenge. Think of it as Kill Kandie! Samuel L Jackson is also brilliant as Candie's servant, he's often hilarious and also very nasty, which sums up Django Unchained! The film is often really funny, with the idiotic Ku Klux Klan being a comedy highlight. The production designs are also breath-taking, especially Candieland's rich set.Whilst Quentin's films can be a tad dialogue heavy, Django Unchained seems to find the right balance between talking and action. The action often arrives thick and fast and surprisingly. Also, the dialogue isn't that much of a chore to watch either, because it's so brilliantly written and full of suspense like the bar scene in Inglourious Basterds. But Django Unchained is even better than Inglourious Basterds! Its a Western with a difference, full of great characters, stupendous screenplay and knock-out directing.It's outrageous that Quentin isn't up for best director! Django Unchained looks amazing. It's a film that you can watch numerous times, as the film flows perfectly. There's one point when I thought that it was going to end, but it actually carried on for another half an hour or so, and it was great! Django Unchained is a triumph. It starts off amazing and doesn't let up, in fact it becomes more and more compelling as the film goes on. And at 2hrs 45mins the film surprisingly rarely drags! It really doesn't feel that long, but time flies when you're having fun and Django is a lot of fun!",

            "content": "From BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Quentin Tarantino, he once described Pulp Fiction as having music similar to a spaghetti western, he had always wanted to make a proper western, so this was his opportunity, and to go a similar direction in terms of history changes like Inglorious Basterds, he definitely didn't disappoint in making it a hit. Basically, set in 1858, the Speck Brothers have purchased several African American slaves, chained them together and transporting them, but they encounter German immigrant dentist Dr. King Schultz (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Christoph Waltz) from D\u00fcsseldorf who is a bounty hunter, and after finding and buying the man he was looking for kills most of the captors. The slave that he releases is Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx), who was separated from his African American wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) and they were sold as slaves to separate parties, and Schultz needs him to identify the Brittle brothers working on a plantation in order to collect the reward for them dead or alive, and they make an agreement to grant the slave's freedom, and give him money and a horse. They succeed in finding and killing the Brittle brothers Big John (Lost's M.C. Gainey), Lil Raj (Cooper Huckabee) and Ellis (Doc Duhame), and the doctor and Django make a deal that if he partners with him as a bounty hunter, killing wanted criminals across plantations and taking a percentage of the reward until spring, he will help him find his and rescue wife, so Django is trained with his gun skill over the winter. They collect many bounties during the season, and they make enquiries and find out that Broomhilda is working as a slave for charming but brutal plantation owner Calvin Candie (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio), Schultz uses his way of words to persuade the ruthless businessman that he and his free manservant and fellow purchaser want to buy one of his male slaves that fight to the death (called \"Mandingo fighting\"). They reach the plantation Candyland in Mississippi, and knowing that Broomhilda speaks German they offer money to buy her so the doctor relieve his desire to speak his mother tongue, so the plan is to sign a document that the money will be paid later and Django will leave immediately with his wife back in his arms. Sinister and suspicious African American house slave/servant Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) is sure however that the female slave and the potential African American purchaser know each other already, and he voices his observations to Candie, so with this information he confronts the two cons. He demands that Schultz and Django pay $12,000 for Broomhilda or he will kill her, the doctor agrees to pay and assumes they can leave, but Candie demands that they should shake hands to finalise the deal or the wife will be shot, and refusing the doctor pulls out his hidden sleeve gun and fires. Candie is killed and a big shoot out ensues, Django shoots many of the men trying to kill him, but stops when Stephen threatens to kill his wife unless he surrenders, and when he does he is tied up, and eventually he is set up to be sent to work to death in a coal mine, this is with Candie's sister Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly (Laura Cayouette) agreement. On the journey though Django convinces the slave drivers and employees of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. (Michael Parks, John Jarratt and Quentin Tarantino) that he is a bounty hunter, presenting a wanted poster as proof, and they agree to free him if they will go back with him to kill some criminals for the reward, but he turns and kills them to escape, taking dynamite, and freeing the other slaves in the cart. Returning to Candyland he finds the dead body of Schultz, taking the certificate from his pocket with Candie's signature that Broomhilda would be freed, and the mourners return from the funeral of Candie where he reveals himself and kills everyone inside, except for Stephen who shows himself as not truly limping, but he gets shot in the knees. In the end Django frees the remaining slaves, he lights the fuse to the dynamite that he had placed around the walls before the company arrived, he and Broomhilda watch from a distance as the house explodes, killing Stephen inside, and they ride away on a horse to live happily together again. Also starring Walton Goggins as Billy Crash, Dennis Christopher as Leonide Moguy, James Remar as Butch Pooch / Ace Speck, David Steen as Mr. Stonesipher, Nichole Galicia as Sheba, Don Johnson as Big Daddy, Franco Nero as Amerigo Vessepi, James Russo as Dicky Speck, Tom Wopat as U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum, Don Stroud as Sheriff Bill Sharp, Amber Tamblyn as Daughter of a Son of a Gunfighter, Bruce Dern as Old Man Carrucan, Jonah Hill as Bag Head #2, Zo\u00eb Bell as Tracker, Tom Savini as Tracker and tom thumb's Russ Tamblyn as Son of a Gunfighter. Foxx gives a good leading performance, Waltz is near scene stealing as the witty and intelligent doctor slash killer, DiCaprio is a marvellous choice for the villain, and Jackson also proves a great surprise as the sinister house butler. This film was not without its controversy, especially in its approach to the history of black slavery, and high use of the \"N\" word, but Tarantino makes it is a thrilling experience, with clever blaxploitation material, witty dialogue, explosive action and adventure, great music choices, and lots of nostalgic homages to classic films, a fantastic spaghetti western. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Tarantino, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Editing and Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama.

For the most part, this movie is a solid, re-imagined western that includes black people often absent from the traditional western narrative. Great characters, great story, great action but then it all goes super pulpy with silly action. It is a pity because if QT had just pulled it back it could have been great but instead it is just great fun. The real shame is for the first half it is excellent but there comes a point when you begin to doubt that even racist evil plantation owners could have said N1gg3r as much as they do in a few scenes, then like the language the action becomes overblown.We still watch \"Man with no name\" films and \"Once upon a time in the west\" decades later, I doubt this will stand the test of time. It may seem like I am down on this movie but honestly go and see it you will enjoy it.I also think not being able to type N1gg3r on a review about a movie that says it about 700 times is ridiculous and I pity the sensitive souls who are so fragile that they allow this word to have so much power and suggest they avoid using youtube and reading the comments otherwise they will find themselves trolled by 12 year olds.",

            "content": "Some of the bad reviews here are completely misleading and just plain wrong. What really frustrates me is when these reviews get voted up. Sucks that I can only vote once on a review. For example, there's this one person who said that the movie was so bad he actually chuckled through most of it. An example of how \"bad\" it was he mentioned the scene with the poorly done bags and said that the men had a 10 minute dialog! 10 minutes?! Way to mislead people who haven't seen this great film, that's not what happened! This awesome and hilarious scene was between 2 to 3 minutes. Also, what makes you think that reviewers \"have a case of Tarantinoism\" and blindly approve of what he does? Here's another bad \"review\" that made me mad. The reviewer said that the best part of the film is when the \"screen went dark and the words THE END appeared\". Is this guy trolling or something? THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED!! The screen stayed as it is and the first thing that popped up was \"Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino\".Update: These two reviews are now gone.Now for the review. Django Unchained, in my opinion, is the best film Tarantino has ever done. It's gory, hilarious, and so entertaining that words can't describe it. He explored the serious issue of slavery and at the same time incorporated his signature style, well done! The story: Django and his wife Broomhilda attempt to run away from the plantation they are enslaved at. As punishment, they were sold at the Greenville slave auction separately. Django was sold to a pair of slave traders called the Speck Brothers. Then along comes a German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz. He tracks down and frees Django because Django is the only one who can identify a trio of wanted outlaws called the Brittle Brothers, who were formerly overseers at the plantation where he was enslaved. In exchange for helping to find and kill the Brittle Brothers, Schultz would give Django his freedom, a third of the money earned from killing them, and help him find and free Broomhilda. The two partner up for the winter and get a good amount of money from bounty hunting. After the winter is over, they find out that Calvin Candie, an evil plantation owner, is the one who bought Broomhilda. Calvin Candie owns a plantation called Candyland, which is known to have slaves fighting each other to the death, something called Mandingo fighting. Schultz and Django then devise an elaborate plan to buy her. I like how the story is told in a linear fashion, deviating from Tarantino's typical telling of a story in chapters. It just flowed so smoothly. My only problem was that the last 20 minutes were a little messy. But everything else is done so well that I can forgive that. In Django Unchained we do get a fine dose of Tarantino's amusing cartoon-like blood and gore, but there is also a good deal of violence here that is unpleasant and very disturbing. Being fed to vicious dogs, Mandingo fighting, suffering in a hot box and brutal whippings are no joke. These scenes are not there for our amusement, they're there to show everyone the horrors of the slavery era. Honestly, I don't think this film moves at a slow pace at all. For a film that's 2 hours and 45 minutes, it sure felt short. An appropriate amount of time was spent developing the characters and as usual we are treated to some amazing, extremely well written, interesting, and witty dialogs. The dinner table scene is almost 25 minutes long, but honestly it only feels like five. Even for those who aren't fans of talky films and haven't seen this, I'm sure that they will be entertained by what Tarantino has to offer here. Django turned from a timid slave into a gunslinging badass, and as events go by in the film we get to see that while Schultz is a lovable badass bounty hunter who enjoys killing evil people and getting himself into tight situations, he has emotions and unfortunately they get the better of him. As the film goes on Calvin Candie reveals his monstrous traits. Honestly, I wish the film was even longer so that Broomhilda could be developed further and maybe know more about her and Django's marriage. Acting wise, this movie is top notch. All the actors just vanish into their roles. Christoph Waltz was amazing as the German bounty hunter Schultz and totally deserved his Oscar. Schultz had the same accent and mannerisms of Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds, but Schultz is a more lovable character on the right side of the law. Leonardo DiCaprio was simply outstanding as Calvin Candie and I was totally disappointed and shocked that he didn't even get nominated for an Oscar. Despite the horrible things that Calvin does, he is such an entertaining character. How is such a monster like Calvin Candie so fun? Well, you need the right script and the right actor for the job, and with Tarantino doing the writing and Leo doing the acting, what we get is absolute gold. No, not gold, platinum. Samuel L. Jackson really stands out as Calvin Candie's head slave, an Uncle Tom called Stephen. He was hilarious and also quite scary. As you watch the film, you will know that he is actually more evil and despicable than Calvin Candie. Sucks that Jackson got almost zero award love. Everyone else also did fantastic, nothing wrong with the acting (except Tarantino, his Australian accent was kinda atrocious lol).Everything is just stellar from top to bottom. Quentin Tarantino is a very talented filmmaker and he has knocked it out of the park yet again. Fantastic movie, and it is now my second favorite movie of all time. Many thanks for reading.9.5/10",

            "content": "The South lost the Civil War but won the peace, with the result that rarely in American cinema -- with a couple of exceptions -- have we seen the full ugliness of slavery put on screen, or the practitioners of that \"peculiar institution\" used to their full potential as screen villains. As the romanticized South's grip on the American imagination begins to wane, however, possibilities start to open up... and it's great to see Quentin Tarantino be one of the first to exploit them.Django Unchained of course has a pedigree in both the Spaghetti western genre from whose \"Django\" it borrows its titular hero's name, and in the \"take it to the Man\" blaxploitation films of the Seventies, and predecessors in \"Southerns\" like \"Mandingo\" -- the bare-knuckles slave-boxing movie whose legacy is present here in the form of \"Mandingo fighting,\" the plausible but not-strictly-historical passion of what at first appears to be the film's main antagonist, Calvin Candie. But Tarantino's influence in the industry means these themes can be treated now with bigger budgets, bigger stars and a far higher profile than they've ever seen before. The results are incredibly satisfying.First and foremost, Django Unchained is a rollicking western in the \"Spaghetti western\" style, at its centre the story of an American ex-slave fighting to steal back his wife from the cruel plantation she's been sold to. It isn't concerned with delivering a history lesson, but needs engage in no exaggerations to build an image of the bottomless cruelty of the peculiar institution, and it doesn't flinch a whit from treating its adherents as villains of either the comical or terrifyingly brutal varieties. The action is heightened and yet viscerally believable as only Tarantino can deliver.Featured in high-powered supporting roles to the excellent Jamie Foxx are Christoph Walz as his mentor, the bounty-hunter and former dentist Dr. King Schultz; and Leonardo di Caprio absolutely relishing his villainous turn as the pretentious and dangerously unstable plantation owner Calvin Candie. And then of course there's Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen, the film's *real* main antagonist and the actual brains running the dread Candyland plantation, a sellout and \"house n*gger\" extraordinaire who seems to take sadistic delight in his own peoples' suffering and who works with deadly cunning behind his stepinfetchit facade.I like that the film's principals, even the villains, are fully realized characters: even Stevie is much more than a caricature, there's a genuine affection in his relationship with Calvin Candie and his loyalty, however twisted, to the plantation. It does take a bit of suspension of disbelief to think that whole tracts of the South of that era wouldn't be in flames the moment rumour got around of a free Negro going around the countryside killing white men -- legally or not -- but basically the film does manage to sell its premise reasonably well.My only real gripe is that the incredible Kerry Washington doesn't get more to do in this film than essentially be the damsel-in-distress object of Django's quest. But the rest of the movie is so exemplary that I can only bring myself to dock it one star for that. Overall: amazing film.",

            "content": "If you're a fan of Tarantino's work, then you will enjoy Django. If you are not a Tarantino fan, then why are you even watching this movie? It's a Tarantino film, so you pretty much know what you're going to get.You're going to get a highly stylized film with great cinematography, an awesome soundtrack, some graphic violence and a lot of well written scenes with tons of great dialogue and top notch acting. In short, if QT isn't your thing, then you should look elsewhere because there isn't a director working today whose films are as easily identified just by watching a scene or two than Tarantino.Luckily, Tarantino happens to be my favorite director and I thoroughly enjoyed Django. After seeing Inglorious Basterds, I started scouring the internet to see what his next project was. I heard he was doing a Western and I was instantly excited because Westerns happen to be one of my favorite genres.For those unfamiliar, Django is about a slave, played with brooding anger by Jamie Foxx, that is freed and then hired by a German-born bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. The bounty hunter is played with infectious energy by Christoph Waltz, who won an Oscar for Inglorious Basterds. There should be a law that Tarantino must put Waltz in every film he makes from here on out. They are a match made in cinema heaven. You can tell QT loves writing for Waltz and I'm not sure another actor could bring QT's words to life like Waltz does.The unlikely duo soon head out to find a trio of murderous brothers. Once that is done, Schultz promises to help Django find his wife, who was separated from him and sold to another slave owner.The subject matter in Django is very serious and is certainly a hot button issue. In fact, Tarantino has been under fire for directing a film portraying African Americans being brutally assaulted and murdered. As a white man, most feel that Tarantino can't properly handle such subject matter. Many people are also upset because the \"N\" word is used over 150 times. Like some of the violence, it sometimes feels a gratuitous.With that being said, I felt that Django is the kind of film that might be seen as empowering for African Americans, much in the same way Basterds was empowering for Jews. You can't help but cheer as the slave owners get what's coming to them.Tarantino isn't trying to make a historical documentary. He proved that with Basterds. He's only concerned about making an entertaining film. I'm not sure there's a director today that continues to be a box office draw, but at the same time, continues to turn out critically acclaimed work.About half way through the film, we are introduced to Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio with a sort of Southnern sleaze that makes you want to strangle him every time he opens his mouth. This is the first villainous role that DiCaprio has played and I was interested to see if he could pull it off. Saying it was a success is an understatement. Every time Candie is on the screen, you can't take your eyes off of him. As the film moves on, it's apparent that Candie's Southern charm or smarm is about to wear off and when it does, all hell breaks loose.Samuel L. Jackson also turns in a good performance as Stephen, Candie's house slave, that adores his owner. Stephen is easily the most hated person in the film. He's a trader to his people. A sin that's worse than anything a white man can commit upon a black man. Jackson's character borderlines on cartoonish, but he's still highly entertaining.My favorite thing about Tarantino's work is how passionate he is about film. His passion can really be felt while watching his movies. Django is no different. It's easy to see how Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns have influenced him. The expansive wide shots of the terrain, to the extreme close-ups of a face or a gun.Django is a perfect companion piece to some of QT's other works like Basterds and even Kill Bill. It's about revenge and setting the record straight. The violence is sometimes over the top, but you can't help but crack a smile as justice is being served. Like the opening slate says in Kill Bill, \"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\" In Django, Revenge is also a dish best served bloody and screaming.",

I feared it may be another Rosewood or Mississippi Burning Well, it was not like either of the two aforementioned movies. Those two movies just completely angered me to the point I could barely watch them. Django, on the other hand, dealt with slavery and the slave era in a different fashion. Instead it focused on one character, Django, and the revenge he was able to exact. Furthermore, Quentin Tarantino seemed to stop short of completely inhuman acts at just the right time so as to spare the audience from enduring some of the brutal Godless acts of slave owners and overseers of that time.That's not to say that the audience was completely spared. There was still plenty of \"N\" word usage and other torturous and degrading behavior displayed. Even with that, Django carried a more jocular tone than most, if not all, slave period pieces. There were quite a few humorous moments and some down-right hilarious moments. Samuel Jackson was a riot as Stephen. He was so over-the-top as the stool pigeon, master-loving, Black-hating house servant that it was LOL funny. It was obvious by the language and manner of speaking that Quentin didn't mind straying from authenticity to give the characters more flavor.Django is highly entertaining with some substance. The acting is top notch with DiCaprio, Jackson, Foxx and Cristoph Waltz. If you are sensitive to slavery as I am, don't be afraid to watch this because just desserts are served.",

Jackson: Quentin Tarantino does it again with a stylish yet extremely violent take on westerns set in the 1800's black slavery era. Jamie Foxx stars as Django Freeman who not only is freed from slavery but also pledges to free his wife Brunhilde, played by Kerry Washington. He is freed and recruited by bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in the hunt for the Brittle brothers. Django proves effective in this area and Schultz learns that Brunhilde is at a plantation run by Calvin Candie. Once again Tarantino showcases his love and knowledge of film with references to classic westerns but he also pulls off the most hilarious Ku Klux Klan sequence in recent memory. Foxx plays the fearless Django driven to the limits to find and free his wife. Christoph Waltz delivers his second excellent Tarantino performance. He plays Schultz as a gifted teacher with the willingness to grant freedom but also see those oppressors driven to defeat dead or alive. Leonardo Di Caprio as Calvin Candie is a sly villain who sets up slave fights for sport. Washington plays the abused Brunhilde who finds relief in the reality of the appearance of her husband whom is scheming to buy her from Candie. Samuel L. Jackson provides humour as Candie's house host who brown noses for favors including exposing Django and Freeman. While the climax is a revenge driven mass of exploding bodies, the controversy surrounding racial slurs is countered by events that have since been unchained to the reality of freedom.

The violence, when it comes, seems provoked but unexpected and unnecessary for the characters involved as I could find no empathetic bond with any of the characters to explain their actions although being a QT film you know that unspeakable violence is always a misplaced word away.

My overall impression is that its like watching a comic and is very funny in places, maybe in other places a bit silly, but thats what you expect from a comic. Then it gives you the other end of the extreme and some of the violence belongs more in a horror flick?We again get the tense and trade mark dialogue around a table, think of the bar scene in IB and you have it here at the plantation, again very good and entertaining.

            "review_title": "This movie will take an emotional toll",
            "content": "I was not prepared for the toll that director Quentin Tarantino's Christmas release, Django Unchained, would take on me. I walked into the theater feeling hesitant but cautiously optimistic, excited if for no other reason than to see Kerry Washingto and Jamie Foxx act opposite one another. I left 2 hours and 45 minutes later feeling jittery, unsettled, and overwhelmed by emotions I hadn't experienced consciously in ages. To be perfectly fair, the film is breathtaking from a cinematographic perspective. Tarantino is an artist, and his eye for camera work is impeccable. He is by no means afraid to take risks, and this resonates with audiences; it is no accident that he has acquired so large a following.The work has already been applauded as groundbreaking; Tarantino has been referred to as \"bold,\" \"daring,\" and \"edgy\" for having the tenacity to write and direct a thriller loosely based on the antebellum South and reveling in depictions of violence primarily against Black people. If I may be blunt, however, I do not believe the risks Tarantino takes in Django are his to negotiate. In \"post-racial\" America\u2014where Black bodies are disproportionally targeted by hate crimes, police brutality, the prison-industrial complex, dishonest housing and banking practices, and numerous other institutional forms of violence\u2014there is nothing novel about a white director choosing to regale A recapitulation of historical and contemporary realities, the film is alarming in that it speaks volumes about Tarantino's\u2014and White America's\u2014delight in severing the Black body. Tarantino depicts countless scenes of brutal dismemberment's; in one particularly haunting one, a \"fighting Mandingo\" is ripped apart by dogs as he begs his amused master Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) for his life. What is particularly disturbing is not simply that Tarantino portrays innumerable Black deaths, but rather the haunting joy emanating from almost all white characters in the film\u2014and white audiences\u2014as it occurs. Certainly death is no stranger to Tarantino films, but there is something particularly gruesome about seeing the gleam in an actor's eye as he instructs two slaves in how to properly kill one another for his enjoyment, cigarette in hand and humanity nowhere to be found. There is something even more sinister at work when one pauses to consider that Dicaprio will likely receive numerous accolades for this role.Perhaps more disturbing than the white savior characterization of Schultz is the amount of time Tarantino spends forcing audiences to bask in racist humor. Though the word \"nigger\" is repeated somewhere between 50 and 100 times in the film, this is nothing compared to the extended laughs that are had quite literally at Black bodies' expense. White audiences roared in laughter as Klansmen on screen spent minutes lamenting their inability to see properly through their masks; the scene was an incredibly extended one in which minor characters were given more lines than Django's wife spoke during the entire film. As I watched Django in an Anaheim theater, fully aware the city was once a Ku Klux Klan stronghold, the dark irony of white audiences' ostensibly light-hearted reaction to this scene was not lost on me. That Tarantino spent more screen time exploring the pain of Klansmen mildly inconvenienced by their masks (before a raid that would end Django's life if successful) than he did fleshing out the thoughts and motivations of major Black characters is further indicative of which audiences he most values. One comment made later in the film\u2014a description of another \"fighting Mandingo\" that jokingly refers to him as \"Niggales,\" a pejorative, racialist allusion to the myth of Hercules\u2014 elicited bellows from most white viewers. The discomfort felt by Black people sitting in their midst was palpable.Tarantino does, however, succeed in presenting a narrative of Black love particularly uncommon in contemporary movies. It is no light matter that the entire premise of Django's exploits is that they bring him closer to rescuing his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). In a social climate that contends Black women are simultaneously unattractive, hyper-sexual, and unfeminine, a movie centered however loosely on the plight of a Black damsel in distress is a breath of fresh air. While white feminists may disagree that this depiction is a positive one and insist that self- actualization is the only liberating motif for women in movies, Black female moviegoers have a far more visceral understanding of just what it means to be forced into self-actualization by virtue of societal demands. More specifically, Black women rarely see images of ourselves in the media that allow for others to support us; rather, both in film and in the world it imitates, we must silently bear others' burdens. While white women can look to any fairy tale or popular romantic comedy to see themselves cared for in some version of the damsel in distress trope, Black women do not have this luxury. Therefore, it cannot go unsaid that Django is one of few films that remind us we are not only deserving of love but also worthy of a partner risking everything to rescue us. To Tarantino's credit, it is this sub-plot\u2014and perhaps the film's explosive finale\u2014that serve as redeeming points in an otherwise psychologically exhausting bloodbath of Black limbs.",

Leonardo DiCaprio is also very good, as is Samuel l Jackson in the most creepy of roles. For me there seemed to be more charismatic guys than Jamie Foxx at every turn, but maybe that's just me as he certainly pairs up with Waltz well enough in the early scenes. There were less striking panoramas and vast vistas than I had expected in a semi spaghetti western but then it occurred to me that Tarantino always has his cinematographer shoot tight and that many of his films could be transferred directly to the stage without much change so lacking are they in this dimension.

            "content": "I have never been a Quentin Tarantino fan, so to say that I enjoyed Django Unchained is a huge testament to the film itself. While Django is not without its flaws, it's an enjoyable film that actually has a little more emotional weight than your typical Tarantino flick.In the film, Jamie Foxx portrays Django, a Southern slave in 1858, who is freed by a German bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz, played with charismatic relish by Christoph Waltz. The two become an unlikely dynamic duo, as they kill bad men for rewards. Meanwhile, Schultz helps Django find his wife who was sold to a vile plantation owner, Calvin J. Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, with more boyish enthusiasm than I've seen from him in years.The performances are top notch and the script does a good job of making these characters likable, for the most part. The two best characters are Candie and Schultz, primarily because they are the most charismatic, but Schultz also turns out to be the most sympathetic and human, in terms of emotional response, than most other characters. The big thing with the script is it never makes Django likable. While I'm rooting for his character because of all the injustices that have separated him and his wife, I don't like Django as a person, especially by the end of the film where he seems to be more interested in exacting revenge, than in love, even after he's already saved his wife. Another misstep in writer/director Tarantino's script, is that he kills off the two most charismatic characters thirty minutes before the end, making the final act feel like a chore to get through. Not to mention, is there really this much need for blood and guts spewing everywhere? The amount of gore was over-the-top, even for the genre that Tarantino is mimicking here.Even through all this, Django Unchained does have its moments, in particular the hilarious scene with an early version of the KKK. As well, from a technical standpoint, this is one of the more masterful films of the year. The cinematography is immaculate, with all of the Spaghetti Western zooms Tarantino employs executed to perfection, never losing focus. As well, this is quite possibly the best edited film of 2012. Is all of this enough to warrant a second viewing? No, but I don't regret seeing the film. I love Christoph Waltz and his character Dr. King Schultz, and I rather enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio getting to have a little bit of fun as Candie.I give Django Unchained a 7 out of 10!",

            "content": "I don't know how he keeps doing it, but Quentin Tarantino always surprises me with his restraint.This might seem like an odd thing to say about the man who gave us the blood-soaked extremes of Kill Bill, Inglourious Basterds and, well, any of his other films, but for whatever reason I always expect his films to completely slip the leash and run wild. Django Unchained maintains the madness of the director's earlier films, but more so than ever before, it feels like he has kept his most extreme instincts relatively in check.Django Unchained begins with a fairly simple A-to-B narrative. Pre-Civil War era slave Django (Jamie Foxx) is acquired (in a classic Tarantino opening scene, rivaling Inglourious Basterds) by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a bounty hunter on the search for three wanted brothers. However, it soon becomes apparent that this hunt encompasses only the film's opening third, and a much more sprawling story unfolds over the course of the close to three hour running time. For assisting Schultz, Django earns his freedom and the pair enter into a vengeful partnership in pursuit of Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), a slave sold to the sadistic Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Perhaps more than any of Tarantino's previous films, it feels like he is really trying to say something with Django Unchained. As great as a film like Pulp Fiction is, it really works on cool factor alone, and couldn't exactly be praised for its depth. Here however, Tarantino seems to know precisely when to dial back the cool to comment on the nature of human violence. While full of outrageous gunfights packed to the brim with geysers of gore, the film features an alarming amount of up close, almost intimate brutality that is very upsetting.Which feels to me like precisely the point. The savagery inflicted upon slaves by their white masters is shoved right in the audiences face, and is much more difficult to endure than the exaggerated violence of the guns, which draw more laughs than anything else. Tarantino has never shied away from violence in his work, but the very clear binary nature of the bloodshed in Django Unchained feels very carefully thought out, and really opens the film up for deeper analysis than anything he has done before.That said, Django Unchained doesn't completely escape Tarantino's self-indulgent streak. The sheer length of the film will certainly cause some viewers to question the necessity of much of the final 30 minutes, particularly the baffling sequence in which the director makes his obligatory cameo appearance. Also, the most egregious use of a certain n-word since Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles is going to raise eyebrows with conservative audiences, opening the debate of whether Tarantino is simply courting controversy in the hopes of drawing a crowd.Aside from perhaps the director himself, the acting is top-notch across the board, with Foxx and Waltz sharing great chemistry, and DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson (as house slave Stephen) both hilarious and frightening in equal measure. Django Unchained navigates a razor-thin space between raucously entertaining and unapologetically confronting, yet rarely veers too far either side to become either exploitative or preachy. It's a familiar but somehow surprising effort from Tarantino, and while it may not rank amongst his most well-crafted films, Django Unchained stands out as a bold and completely assured work from a modern auteur doing exactly what he wants to do. tinribs27.wordpress.com",

The set up is that Django (Jamie Foxx) is freed from his life as slave by Dr Shultz (Christoph Walz) to help him track down 3 outlaws and in return he will help Django free his wife from her life of slavery. Simple.The film is a mammoth 165 minutes long - but the time flew by and the film kept me entertained from beginning to end. Django has everything you'd expect from a QT film, both good and bad. Excellent dialogue, rounded colourful characters, magnificent acting, a wonderful soundtrack and of course bucket loads of humour. Last but by no means least the most important element of any of QT's films - lots and lots of violence, blood and gore and liberal use of the 'N' word....... Unlike many critics, I don't have a problem with the use of the \"N' word. It certainly seems warranted in a film set in the deep south in 1858. Now, for the bad parts of the film. Some of the plot developments seem a little too silly, but that is forgivable. It is after all a work of fiction and not a documentary. But the one big unforgivable, is that QT needs to reign himself in, or to have someone strong that can stand up to him and reign him in. The final act of the film, was a little on the ridiculous side. I don't want to give anything away here, but it is pretty obvious where QT thinks, you know what, there just hasn't been enough blood and violence and crazy developments yet - so he just goes over board..... I've got to say, Quentin JUST STOP IT!!!!!I really don't understand how Django won the Oscar for \"Best Writing, Screenplay written directly for the screen\". Surely that honour should have gone to Wes Anderson for Moonrise Kingdom. I guess Django is a long film and most of the members of The Academy are very old, so probably feel asleep after 2 hours and missed most of the crazy last act.Having said all of that, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would have given it a better score if QT had have been a little less like a kid in a sweetshop in the last 40 minutes of the film!",

            "content": "My first cinema-going in 2013 is dedicating to Tarantino's DJANGO UNCHAINED, a Spaghetti-Western spoof colored with slavery exploitation, but with his usual stellar cast, talkative banters, pulp violence, it is an excellent body of work with mash-up entertainment, which safely to say, Quentin's staunch fan-boys will not be disappointed, while new blood may also be introduced since it has already been Quentin's top-grossing film in the North American continent, driven by its 5 Oscar-nominations momentum like INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009, 8/10) three years ago (which actually procured a more impressive 8 nominations including BEST DIRECTOR), the international territory will soon be conquered without any doubt. There are tons of laughters can be elicited during the lengthy 165 minutes, propelled by 3 great supporting performances, the hero Django has been outclassed for most of the time, a belated slaughter outburst only arrives in the last 15 minute. Christoph Waltz's German bounty hunter has a joyous gloss with droll quips which is a far cry from his Oscar- winning role in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, but deliciously refreshing. On the second half, when Leonardo DiCaprio's plantation owner shows up, he outshines the rest of the group (even Waltz, maybe not Mr. Jackson) in his accurate Southern accent and infuses his wicked mien and charm with pitch-perfect showmanship, it is a daring attempt, and I must say I am very impressed. Last but not the least of the three musketeers, Samuel L. Jackson has eventually regained his ginger in another Quentin's vehicle, his vicious stare sets a heinously creepy tone from his very first scene, and juggles with a minion's subservience to mask his man-behind-the-curtain mastery. It is an ace in the hole to designate a black boss to circumvent all the presumed racist's accusation around slavery, Quentin Tarantino is a virtuoso screen-writer and a story-concocter. Jamie Foxx has gained his best leading role since his Oscar-crowning RAY (2004, 8/10), although most of time he has been subdued into a marginalized sidekick, he and Kelly Washington (who is very underrated not only in this film) does make for a great couple on screen, his Django-spelling scene with Franco Nero (who is the leading man in DJANGO, a 1966 spaghetti by Sergio Corbucci, a film from where Quentin gets his inspiration) is the tribute moment for all the fans. So, as we all know, it is Waltz gets an Oscar nomination, but I firmly support Leonardo this time, and his acting range and personal knack has been tested and emanated to the hilt through years of versatile roles, I question when a due Oscar will ever come under his belt, his recent taking-a-long-break-from-acting manifestation may suggest he finally comes to the terms with the disillusion. Digressing back to the film, one can always enjoy a great deal of time in Quentin's cornucopia of vintage refrains and other trendy tunes, when Western meets Rap, the blood must spout stronger! Even violence has been transformed into some sort of comical set pieces when the uplifting melodies are chanting alongside the imminent shootouts. The film is a true Tarantino masterpiece and he always makes it the fullest!",

            "content": "Tarantino films often play out as violent revenge fantasy, and that's what we have here, aimed at a historical catharsis of sorts over slavery. The setup to the story is clever, the cinematography and soundtrack are excellent, and the performances from Jamie Foxx, Cristoph Waltz, and Leonard DiCaprio are all wonderful. The film exposes the cruelty of slavery in both brutal and subtle ways, the asinine beliefs of the racism of the period, and sends up an early version of the KKK. It also manages to avoid falling into a \"white savior\" trap, with Foxx's character being a total badass.However, it's a tricky thing for a filmmaker like Tarantino to be making a film with this setting. His intentions were undoubtedly good, but as his focus was on making a popcorn flick instead of something more subtle, he ran the risk of making a cartoon out of an institution that lasted centuries and caused suffering that's impossible to fathom. For me he didn't cross a line there, but I didn't like the degree to which Samuel L. Jackson's character clung to his loyalty for his white master; it didn't seem authentic and worse, seemed to play on a stereotype. The film also stumbled a bit towards the end, with Tarantino making a ridiculous appearance and a final confrontation that lacked imagination. Overall though, it was an engaging, highly watchable film.",

But this is one of the few of his film's I've liked.It's crazy, over-the-top violent. At times that seems excessive, but overall I was okay with it.The movie is very much in the vein of big westerns, only it's not in the west and it is centered on slavery. The movie has a gut-punch approach and aims for a Peckinpah nastiness. I like it better than Peckinpah, who I never liked.The movie is not trying to be realistic. You can see this in the language; black characters speak in the same basic dialect as white actors, even though as uneducated people only a generation or two from Africa that couldn't possibly be the case. But it's a useful way to establish the humanity of slaves; we tend to relate more to people who speak as we do.I read some interesting analysis of this movie regarding whether the language is appropriate or racism porn. I can see both sides.The only other western I've seen that directly dealt with racism was the 70s comedy Skin Game, starring James Garner and Louis Gossett. Of the two, I prefer Skin Game which is very pointed without the excesses of Django. Very funny movie I highly recommend.",

            "content": "It's official; \"Inglourious Basterds\" and \"Django Unchained\" are only the first opus of a trilogy, to be concluded by a spin-off of the first film, titled \"Killer Crow\". I don't know how reliable this piece of information is, but if Tarantino changes his mind, here are other propositions: \u0095 A young Gallic warrior witnesses the massacre of his tribe by the Romans, he becomes a gladiator then frees himself and finds the fat, decadent and truculent Roman senator (Oscar-nominated performance for John Goodman) who married the woman of his life and only survivor of the massacre, the film would be a clear homage to 50's/60's swords-and-sandals epics.\u0095 Or a young Alien attacks Earth with a small group of space-smugglers, to avenge his planet blew up by a nuclear bomb while he was hunting for space-mushrooms in an asteroid, the film, would be a clear homage to 50's Sci-Fi B-movies...\u0095 Or a young anthropologist (or make it a girl) goes back to the Amazonian forest in order to find and massacre the ferocious tribe of cannibals that ate her family, the film would be a clear homage to 50's Adventure B-movies and 70's/80's cannibal films.Or maybe, it would have been better to consider \"Django Unchained\" as the last opus of a 'revenge' trilogy initiated by \"Kill Bill\", and after that 'glorious' conclusion, Quentin Tarantino could finally abandon his retro-business film-making, recycling the same old plot lines. I know \"Django Unchained\" is supposed to be a Western Spaghetti, but in all due respect, it's only a different dish cooked with the same ingredients : \u0095 Totally unredeemable villains, after Nazis and slavers, maybe one day we'll have Islamic mass terrorists, so no one would care if their heads are reduced to pulp, especially by a bad-ass hero: Jamie Foxx as a black Clint Eastwood without the charisma.\u0095 A scene-stealing smooth-talking villain: \"Leo was a bingo!\" and I wish he got the Oscar nod instead of Waltz who didn't bring much newness to the screen. I concede though that the casting of Samuel L. Jackson as an antagonist black character was disturbing, effective and the film's masterstroke.\u0095 A bloody climax, the film features the biggest blood squibs you'll ever see, it gets a bit redundant and tends to undermine the seriousness of the subject Tarantino tries to sell. But it's even more unfortunate that the trigger was a very weak set-up, you'll judge it by yourself but Tarantino is such a great writer, he could have came up with a better idea.Speaking of the obligatory 'orgy of blood': \u0095 It made sense in \"Kill Bill\" as the series was supposed to be a stylish homage to the Kung-fu movies, the over-the-top and choreographed directing elevated the film above the very standards it copied.\u0095 But in \"Django\" as in \"Basterds\", as they say in French, Tarantino 'mixes his pencils', sometimes it's gritty and realistic in a very graphic way, and some others it's so exaggerated you can't take the seriousness of the subject, seriously.\u0095 And it's even worse when you take it seriously as the 'unpleasant' aspect of violence is mostly due the way it manipulates our feelings: just because these guys are really bad guys, they deserve to die the worst way, or we're supposed to cheer at these 'geysers of blood' sights and their screams of pain. It's unpleasant because it efficiently desensitizes us from any form of guilt or sympathy.And considering all the mass-murders that occurred in America in 2012, even in the name of action and style, i'm not sure watching a guy randomly massacring people is what American young audience needs to see. Sorry, but Tarantino makes it 'look cool', using all the super-villains archetypes as an excuse to justify it, just because it's Nazis, we can scalp them, just because they're slavers, they deserve to be shot in the bloodiest way. And as usual, we're the one who 'don't get it', because violence is 'everywhere \u0085 yadda-yadda.Or maybe this was all part of the same old scheme intended to leverage the film's publicity on the typical controversy about violence? This is getting old seriously\u0085 My problem with Tarantino, isn't that he should stop imitating other directors, he should stop imitating himself, it's like he knows people would love the movie first and go watch it after. Then why bother with a new idea, any Tarantino film is a good film. And the whole controversy on violence, Weinstein's lobbying, and a massive Oscar-campaign * will complete the publicity, if publicity was ever needed. I'm sure many fans would have found it average if the exact same film was directed by another name. But when it's Tarantino, woo-hoo, they all try to find reasons to love it, moved by a Pavlovian reaction.(*all the tricks that prevented Spike Lee's masterpieces such as \"Do the Right Thing\", \"Malcolm X\" or \"25th Hour\" to get the acclaim they deserved, I don't expect everyone to be a fan of Lee, but ask yourself who is the most controversial or rebel director, who's the most politically incorrect? Tarantino avoids all the racist allegations while Lee is tagged of racist and anti-Semitic very easily) Now, why shouldn't we accept that even Tarantino can lose his touch, after all, even Martin Scorsese, now that he's trying to imitate Spielberg, has lost it since \"Casino\". I used to love Tarantino, it was a time where he influenced cinema, now, it's cinema influencing him. And talk about character's under-development, Django? Kerry Washington's character? More fascinating and absorbing than Mr. Blonde? Mr. Orange? Jules Winfield? Jackie Brown or Bill? I doubt so...One positive mention though, because as much as I criticize \"Django\", I quite enjoyed it as a 'benign entertainment': the Ku-Klux-Klan was probably one of the funniest scenes I've ever had to watch in a long time",

And now Django unchained.Tarantino does it again! Awesome, awesome, awesome, will definitely watch it again this week. Better than IB, razorsharp script - even in the German version this definitely shines through, cuedos to the translators, breathtaking photography, and what could you possibly say about the actors, apart from stellar. Foxx's transition from slave to a proud, cool as f**k free man is nothing short of mesmerizing. Waltz is marvellous, as opposed to his Landa, here we have a killer with charm and a heart of gold, sort of (it's Tarantino), but who really steals the show is de Caprio. He makes Mr. Blonde look like your dream son in law. You have to see it to believe it. Amazing, how Tarantino rips out performances from well established actors that you wouldn't believe they could deliver. The soundtrack is simply great, it suits the scenes in ways you wouldn't believe. Of course the splatter factor reaches heights formerly unseen, and admittedly I couldn't stomach two scenes and hid behind my hand, and you're in for some \"ear splatter\" too.

As a result, I wasn't racing to the cinema once Django Unchained was released, in spite of the stellar cast and captivating trailer. When the film started, I was expecting the typical tale of vengeance portrayed in uber violent Tarantino fashion and isn't that part of the reason so many are drawn to his work? (So why chastise the man for it?)Django Unchained is a story where a chance meeting leads to the emancipation of a slave, played by Jamie Foxx, only to see Django transform in to a skilled bounty hunter. An agreement between the mentor, Christoph Waltz, and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is struck which culminates in the partners rescuing Django's slave wife.The twist about Django is, I quite enjoyed it and would argue that it's perhaps Tarantino's finest work to date! Firstly, the unexpected cameos like Don Johnson and Jonah Hill were a pleasant surprise as was the simplistic yet very amusing dialogue. When you're not chuckling at the banter, you'll be drawn in by the captivatingly raw emotion that Tarantino encapsulates perfectly. Yes, there is exceptional violence but it's about appreciating the vision rather than judging it.One can't attribute the success of Django solely to Tarantino's talent, as it wouldn't be as entertaining without equally riveting performances from the lead characters as well as Leonardo DiCaprio. However, there is one character that stands out above the rest and that is Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of Stephen. If you're a fan of The Boondocks, where Jackson also guest stars, Stephen is as close as you'll get to a cross between Uncle Ruckus and Stinkmeaner and the end result is absolutely hilarity!In an industry where films are continually becoming predictable, Tarantino shares an entertaining tale with twists, turns, humour, action, drama and that fading facet, originality. With intense direction and clever writing which is complimented by outstanding performances, Django Unchaiend is one unmissable feature.Django Unchained is definitely one to watch on the big screen!",

But Django has his own mission to be reunited with his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who he learns is being held as a slave at a plantation owned by the mean hearted Calvin Candie (Leonardo Di Caprio.)Taking inspiration once again from his love of all things ultra violent, Quentin Tarantino here turns his attention to his appreciation of blood splattered spaghetti westerns from the 60's and 70's, with this ultra lengthy homage to another little known entry from the genre. Always finding new ways to be controversial, this time around his new film caused outrage among a vested minority with it's excessive use of the racial term 'nigger', even by other black characters. Although the term is casually thrown around through out the course of the script, it never feels gratuitous in any way, and probably does serve as an accurate reflection of the culture and attitude back then, and could even serve to highlight how the word could have deeper connatations of how blacks used it towards certain other blacks rather than just whites against blacks.For the most part, the film seems on a desperate mission to bore you to death, lumbering along as it does at it's outrageously over-bearing nearly three hour running time, with long periods of no action among it's trade mark Tarantino usage of lengthy, lingering dialogue and exposition. It just fails to strike the balance right, and comes off feeling like a self indulgent love fest to one man's own passions. This on it's own won't endear it to the target demographic, and so it's left to more superficial things to save the day. When the action does heat up, more towards the end, it's appropriately blood splattered and ultra crazy, and it's carried along by a lively soundtrack blending more old school western tunes with modern hip hop beats, to maybe strike a balance between the generations, what with westerns being an old genre enjoying a resurgence.It ultimately falls on the cast to carry something striving to be this epic, and so it is a blessing that the cast are so dynamic. In the lead, Foxx embodies the mean, moody manner of the lonesome cowboy, a knock in the teeth to the days when having a black lead in something like this would have been thought inconceivable, while following on from his involvement in Tarantino's last Inglorious Basterds, Waltz is on fine form here as a mysterious, eccentric man whose motivations and behaviour are never quite made clear. But it's Di Caprio as the villain who steals the show, investing the role as he always does with his intensity and dynamism, bending it well in to an evil role, served well with support from Samuel L. Jackson as an elderly sell out black worker who sees himself as a cut above the food chain. All these great performances, though, would have been better served in something more restrained and less illustrious. ***",

I love most of Tarantino, and this movie started actually OK, if somewhat incredulous, until they got to Mr. Candie, when it took a turn for the worse. I accepted a lot loose ends, such as how come from a slave that wasn't allowed anything even to ride on a horse, he was suddenly good at riding a horse and shooting like John Wayne? Or what was happening to the bodies they were accumulating? Or how come Mr Schults was so damn sure about everybody's course of actions as to enable him to be so cocky? And how come James Remar gets killed at the beginning then gets to be another character later on, this wasn't a comedy sketch? Or how come the black women in Mr Candies establishment Cleopatra club were all wining, dining and dressed and behaving like white ladies if they were slaves and therefore beneath them? But when Mr Candie appeared, it just took the biscuit, I thought Caprio was so miscast in the role, his southern accent was absolutely horrendous to my ears (Im no expert) and he looked so uncomfortable in them period clothes. He wasn't at all menacing, which I thought he was supposed to be, not even when he threw a bit*h fit at the dinner table. I admit I found it so boring that after the part Django surrendered, I just skimmed through till the end, but enough to see a Tarantino putting on an, what it seemed, English accent or something? He looked and sounded ridiculous! Another ridiculous sight was Django, now a free man, choosing his own clothes, ending up choosing to look like a buffoon in bright blue. Damn funny that was! Same for Samuel Jackson in that role of the demented, dunno, administrator? He was so annoying and may I dare, ugly as hell. I didn't mind the N word or the violence and brutality, after all this was expected in a movie about slaves. The part where it didn't make much sense to me was buying Django's wife. If they were prepared to pay top dollar for her, why didn't they just offer Candie top dollar for her instead of putting up all that farce about buying a wrestler? And why were Candie and Jackson ticked off about it, since there were merely doing business? But if they did that we wouldn't have had the pleasure of seeing all that guts and brains spilled all over Candie's sister lovely hallway, now would we! I have now become convinced that Tarantino loves violence and brutality in general, but particularly against women, and since he cannot act on it, putting it in his movies seems the best choice. I would not say don't see it, save your time, etc, but Im sure you wont enjoy it a fraction as much as other of his movies, this one is very inferior.",

            "content": "Equally loved and hated for his indulgent stylistics, Quentin Tarantino is the proper definition of an auteur. Often regarded for classics like Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds, and Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino specializes in a unique visual identity, and his signature long conversations that showcase his writing. I can only speak for myself, but no one writes dialogue better than he does. After flirting with spaghetti western undertones in Basterds, it seemed only obvious that his next would be a full on, gritty western. However, the question still remained: Would it translate well to the screen? Let's put it this way. If you're not a fan of his style, this won't change your mind. If you are a fan, you'll probably have a blast with Django Unchained.We open in the 1850's, where German dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) purchases the freedom of a slave named Django (Jame Foxx). Schultz teaches Django - the D is silent \u2013 the ways of bounty hunting, and the two ride into various towns killing wanted criminals. In exchange for helping him with this job, Schultz offers to help Django find his missing wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is currently in the possession of the unpredictable land and slave owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).If you've seen any of Tarantino's other films, you know what you can expect here. He is very indulgent in his own stylistics, supplying the movie with over the top humor, anachronistic music, and a slight air of silliness to it. Needless to say, it's not perfect... but, that's why I love it so much. The movie's imperfections are its charms, and even if I have a few nit-picks, criticizing Tarantino for indulgence would be like criticizing the winter for being cold. I adore the direction he was going for this movie, and the overall tone and technical prowess offers much to be admired.As always, Tarantino's writing is the highlight. Once again, he uses his extended conversations well, building up the tension of each one to hold one's attention. You can never predict when a character may go flying off the handle, and what that may entail. Tense, character rich, and gritty, the movie also fully delves into the issues of racism with uncompromising detail. Tarantino also finds a way to mix in well placed humor, with an argument over white hoods that made me ache with laughter. The movie is pretty long, about 2 and three quarter hours, but it's surprisingly easy to sit through until it's over. It's certainly one of the most entertaining movies I've watched all year.The cast is equally impressive, all selling the traits and personalities of their characters. Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz are both impressive, cool, and share an easy chemistry, Waltz in particular selling much needed comic relief. Samuel L. Jackson, a Tarantino staple, gets to steal the scene as Calvin Candie's seedy and suspicious right hand man Stephen. Then we get down to Leonardo DiCaprio. For a long time, DiCaprio has been an actor who really seemed to take himself too seriously when it came to roles. Here, he gives probably his best performance since The Aviator. It's so much fun seeing him play such a delightfully wicked and viciously comical villain, providing him with the dramatic break that was perfect for him. He's chewing the scenery, and having a blast with it.Like I said, this is not a perfect film, but it is pure Tarantino. Those who love that will eat it up, while others may not get too into it. The fact still remains that Django Unchained is constantly entertaining, varying on the eye of the beholder, of course. One of the year's best. Adult supervision is required...***** / *****",

            "content": "There is no doubt about Quentin Tarantino's ability as a storyteller. The narrative of \"Django Unchained\" is further evidence of that ability, but his film-making abilities sometimes get in the way of the telling.Though Django (Jamie Foxx) is the film's protagonist, he is an unlikely partner to Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and they share the lead. Each is a unique character, but they come to align themselves in common goals and, eventually, a common quest. The slave Django finds himself outside the law and--thanks to Schultz-- possessing freedoms that challenge his moral compass. But this is a Tarantino film, so the compass never strays far from a monomaniacal drive to achieve the completion of the quest. Tarantino graces the story, which is set in the antebellum South, with inherent humor, mostly achieved through the subtlety of Christoph Waltz's acting. His German bounty hunter executes a matter-of-fact demeanor in extraordinarily stressful situations.The story unfolds gracefully, allowing the viewer to discover background stories and motivations without unnecessary voice-overs or dialogue that is merely explanatory. This is done economically and clearly.However, the story later suffers from uneven pacing. This is distracting and reduces the effectiveness of the film. Likewise, some artistic choices take the viewer out of the narrative, including some quick camera zooms, excessive gore that goes well beyond Sam Peckinpah's style, and the use of a Jim Croce song in one montage.Tarantino has created an intriguing world that is unique, then cluttered it with extraneous attention-grabbing elements. This may be attributed to self-indulgence, but the viewer's indulgence is earned through the director's creativity and his obvious love for his creation.",

            "content": "Django Unchained is a Quentin Tarantino film. That is all most people need to know to get them to watch it. Most of us have seen (and probably loved) Pulp Fiction and therefore that's enough to get us to keep watching his films forever in the hope of reliving that classic movie. However, over the years, this eclectic film-maker has dabbled in various different types of film - most of them have been hits and all of them have been hits to someone. Just because you liked his last one, won't mean you'll automatically like his next.Django Unchained is about a slave (Django) in America - pre Civil War - who is trained up to hunt down and rescue those responsible for abducting and torturing his long-lost wife.The biggest similarity I can make with this film would be Tarantino's previous outing - Inglorious Bastards. IB was Tarantino's take on World War II and DU is his imagining of the slave trade in the deep south of America. It's a long, rambling epic of a movie, filled with erroneous dialogue and gratuitous violence (not to mention racially offensive language in this case).It's quite exhausting to watch, but, once you've say through it, you'll hopefully feel that it was worth the journey. Obviously, you'll need a strong stomach. Tarantino is not one to do things by half measures. Expect a LOT of violence and a LOT of bad language.If you've enjoyed Quentin's previous dark humorous epics then you'll probably like this one. I don't claim to know how factually accurate it is, but it's still a ride-and-a-half anyway.Note the hilarious - if a little out of place - scene with the lynch mobs discussing their 'wardrobe malfunctions' - classic.",

            "content": "I went to see this after weighing up a number of reviews from different sources. I can only say I wasn't disappointed, but despite the film's strengths it has one major weakness. I'll try to outline these without spoilers.Strengths: (1) Outstanding performances from Leonardo Dicaprio, Samuel L. Jackson (both a big surprise as baddies and proving the versatility of these actors), plus Christoph Waltz was the most engaging character in the film, and Jamie Foxx was very good too. (2) Some excellent set- piece scenes, especially in the first half - the scene where Schultz meets Django is hilarious. (3) Also surprisingly, a really, really earnest attempt by Tarantino to grapple with the slavery issue on a visceral level. To criticize him for his use of the 'n' word and excessive violence is to miss the point. This is what slavery was like: nasty, brutal and racist. The film depicts the horror of slavery in all its repellent detail, and should be commended for this, not criticized.Weakness: Only one, but it's a biggie. The last part of the film, from the conclusive interaction between Dicaprio and Waltz onwards, lost me emotionally, where I had been very involved up to that point. After this it became cartoonish (perhaps deliberately?) and instead of the ending being moving it just felt empty. The scene with the Australians, for example, was just silly, not believable, and not even funny at all. That Django was even in that position after what he had done not long before was ridiculous. Although Tarantino has cleverly avoided falling into clich\u00e9, I don't think the resolutions he came up with were convincing in terms of some of the characters' motivations. There were other options, which one can identify simply through memory of several Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns. The outcome could be the same, but the method of arriving at it needed to be more believable.I think, like so many directors and writers, Tarantino has struggled to get the ending right. Despite many claiming that the film is too long, I think in the end Tarantino actually needed to develop the denouement at greater length and more satisfactorily for it to have any emotional or intellectual bite. Kill Bill 2 suffered severely from similar problems.Overall, then, a very worthy attempt at a revival of the spaghetti western (one of my favourite genres), but the script would have needed a redraft in the last third.",

            "content": "Django Unchained After rewriting history and the demise of Hitler in his last film, everyone's favorite ex video store worker turned cult film director Quentin Tarantino is back, this time he puts his own spin on the spaghetti westerns of the 60's and 70's. Those of you who have followed Tarantino since he first burst onto the scene 20 years ago with brilliant Reservoir Dogs will know that he doesn't so much as remake films but take a bunch of ideas from obscure films from all types of countries, eras and genres and mash's them together in an explosive blender and what normally emerges is a stylistic, visceral, in your face and down right entertaining film.Django is no different, the first Django film itself was made in 1966, and the original man to play Django makes a cameo in this film, throughout the film there is more than just passing nods to house of the flying daggers, Battle Royal and young guns, but like I said before none of this is a surprise and it certainly didn't affect my enjoyment of the film, my only real surprise was I didn't enjoy the film as much as I had hoped.I am not sure why I left the cinema slightly disappointed by Django, it had all the standard elements that I normally love about a Tarantino film, snappy dialogue filled with quotable sound bites, charismatic actors who really look like there are enjoying themselves, a good bit of mindless violence and a simple to follow plot which doesn't leave you scratching your head as to what is going on. I think maybe I just expected a little more, it kinda felt a bit like someone else was trying to make a Tarantino film, like a pop band doing a cover of a song that was originally done by a rock band. Maybe I am being a little harsh, I did think it was a really good film but maybe Quentin Tarantino is now a victim of his own success, he has raised the bar so high that it is impossible for him to keep up those standards.One thing that cannot be denied though is the performances his is capable of bringing out of his actors, Chistopher Waltz was once again amazing as the quirky yet deadly Dr Schltz, Leonardo DiCaprio was clearly having the time of his life playing the pantomime baddie but the guy who stole the show for me was Samuel L Jackson. He really is excellent as Stephen the Head Housekeeper of DiCaprio's plantation. Whenever he is on screen just keep an eye to him, especially when someone else is talking, his facial expressions and demeanor are both hilarious and terrifying all at the same time.So in closing I would say go and see Django, it's and entertaining way to spend 2 and a half hours, but just be aware it's probably only Tarantino's 5th best film behind Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, Kill Bill and Reservoir Dogs. Oh and if you do go see it, keep an eye out for Tarantino making his usual cameo. Is it just me or is he starting to look like Jaws from the James Bond films?",

Django Unchained looked like it could start a streak that started with his 2009 film. It certainly looked as great, with a great cast. Turns out that it's just sort of disappointing. Tarantino films always have his trademark style, always homages to genres. This is an entertaining film no doubt, but it just lacks the extra spark that made Basterds work so much. This is in part due to some weak pacing. The film lags at certain points, most notably the last act. It all should work more than it does, but it somehow doesn't. There's still enough here to make it work though, and that's thanks to some of the performers. Jackson is fun here, but there's nothing incredibly special about his performance. Dicaprio is also fun but to a higher extent. He makes the role work wonders, and although you always see Dicaprio acting, it's still enough to remind me of his great work from years ago. Christoph Waltz is the clear stand-out though. I've only seen him in Basterds and last year's Carnage and I had already become a fanboy of his. He nails this role to absolute perfection. He's just able to perfectly deliver lines in the way Tarantino absolutely intends, squeezing all of its juicy potential and making yet again another truly great character. If there's one aspect of the film that deserves tons of nominations and awards, it's Waltz. It's also somewhat of a borderline category performance. He certainly has the screen-time of a lead, but the last half of the film certainly tells us that it's really the film of Django... and there's the problem. Foxx has absolutely no charisma, no glowing screen presence. The character could have worked with someone better, but with Foxx it's such a middling character. Disappointment? Definitely, but this is still very much worth seeking out. As a whole it's just nowhere near as tight and controlled of a film as Basterds was, or as well-directed. But two of its actors are working at a higher command here, one of whom gives one of the best performances of the year.",

Made in typical Tarantino style (use of colours, cinematography, sets, dialogues etc) it's a treat to watch right from the opening credits.

At the same time, it's one of the most unique films of the western (or southern, as the man himself would like to put it) genre that also touches on history.Like most Tarantino films, this one is pretty graphic and even gory to an extent but that's expected. Moreover, the film doesn't rely on this nor does it o over the top. 'Django Unchained' is stunning to look at. The landscape is beautifully captured. The sets, costume and makeup look authentic (thanks to the art team, makeup and wardrobe). The soundtrack has a very retro feel to it and adds to the western style. Bob Richardson's cinematography is first rate.Regarding the cast, all the actors deliver topnotch performances. Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Kerry Washington, Leonardo Dicaprio, Samuel Jackson and Walton Goggins are superb.'Django Unchained' is classic Tarantino.

            "content": "One of my favourite directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino, did his personal best in this movie. Everything lines up perfectly: the heroic plot mixed with an amazing cast, the intense topic and the physical and mental brutality, along with Django's personal character arc. With some subtle comedy sprinkled on top here and there, this movie satisfied me on an exceptional level and had me hooked until the last minute.I have to say, when I watched this movie for the first time, I thought it was nothing exceptional, I was even left a little disappointed because I had expected more from Tarantino. It felt nothing was happening for too long of a time, the goal of saving the girl seemed too far in the future with a lot of unnecessary hold-ups along the way. Regardless, I felt inclined to rewatch it the next day for whatever reason, maybe to understand why it felt so different to me. And when I watched it again, it felt like watching a completely different film. Because I'd already known the plot and what would happen, I was able to focus on everything else, all the little details and flavours and I got incredibly invested in it. Beyond the intense in-your-face brutality which is typical for Tarantino, it has subtle layers of emotional conflict and reality. Rewatching it allowed me to immerse myself and find these layers in the exaggerated cinematography. This in combination is what makes this movie so great.The topic of slavery is a sensitive topic for sure, and I can se where the criticism comes from, but I have to strongly disagree with it. It was a brutal, unfair and absolutely horrible time, and therefore it deserves a brutal, unfair and absolutely horrible display on film, it doesn't matter if it 100% historically accurate. This intense display makes the revenge scenes so much more worth it, and finally there is a character that isn't \"too good\" for revenge and gives people what they deserve. It also makes the freedom scenes extremely enjoyable and emotional. I really felt with the main character throughout the whole film.There is not much to say about the acting except that it is immaculate. Foxx and DiCaprio did an extraordinary job and Christoph Waltz made this whole movie come to life with in my opinion his best performance throughout his whole career. This film was like it was made for him.All in all, I recommend this movie to everybody who isn't too sensitive on blood, shootings and brutality. To me, it's a must-see, especially as a Tarantino fan!",

Every actor and actress does a splendid job in their role, from Jamie Foxx to Leonardo DiCaprio. The action is very satisfying to watch play out, and I don't feel that way about many films that I watch.Literally, the only issue I have with the movie is the occasional modern rap or pop song that crops up once or twice. This film appropriately uses a lot of western, cowboy music and does so well. So, you can understand my disappointment when during a climatic action scene of the film I hear, \"GET IT ON TILL I DIE,\" screamed in the background.

Considering how long the movie was, there was never really any background or retrospective given as to how Django gets so prolific with a riffle that he's sniping dudes off of galloping horses some 100 yards away or clearing out rooms full of bandits wheeling a six shooter in each hand..Waltz and Decaprio are what kept me from rating this movie a 2. They save a little face with masterful pontification back and forth between the two characters. Foxx is ehh as Django. Nothing special really. He could have sold the transformation from slave to cocky bounty hunter a little better.You can tell how bad this movie really would have been by the last 30 min or so once it's just Jamie Foxx's character carrying the weight.

            "content": "Going into a Tarantino film I expected a lot of blood and gore with a lot of action. I also expected an extremely unusual soundtrack. I didn't really have high hopes for a story line but Django Unchained didn't meet all of those expectations. What lacked in action, for the first 70% at least, thrived in rich characters and an amazing story. This movie completely blew me away. Django is a slave who was set free by a bounty hunter so he could get help on a bounty. The deal was for Django to help with the bounty in exchange for freedom. Now, I thought that was going to be the entire movie with one act dedicated to hunting down one brother. Instead the three brothers are all taken down at once and then I'm wondering where they go from there. Django then tells a story of how he was married and he and his wife were separated. The bounty hunter, Dr. Schultz is German and Django's wife was also German so they set on a quest to go save her. That is the real story. Find the wife and gain the freedom. Jamie Foxx kills it as Django. It was so much fun to watch his character develop from a shaky slave into a cold blooded killer. He is driven by revenge at first and then by love. He wants to find his wife. He and Dr. Schultz naturally get along and connect. Their relationship drives the movie for the first half. Christoph Waltz shows an Oscar caliber performance as Django's mentor. He teaches Django how to kill and be a bounty hunter. In essence, he really saved his life. He treats Django like a man and not a slave. He lets him ride a horse, take the kill, even dress how he wants. From the beginning he makes his appearance in this movie known and sets the tone for the entire movie. Django's wife is owned by one of the biggest slave owners in the South, Calvin Candie, who is played by Leo DiCaprio. Leo steals the show. He plays the villain and you can tell he enjoyed it and had so much fun with the role. The first scene he is in he is watching a brawl between slaves. It is a fight to the death and he is cheering on his slave. One problem with the movie I do have is that it can be very disturbing at times. Seeing blood everywhere from being beaten to a pulp is hard to watch. I think he ripped an eye out as well. Then he finished him off with a hammer to the skull. The blood and death isn't the problem, it's the idea of why he is killing him. It is for pure amusement and money of Candie. That was his first scene and the audience knows he means business and he is an evil man. I don't really know if anybody expected this movie to be as funny as it was but it was hilarious. From the first scene to the ending credits I was laughing constantly. Schultz provides a lot of the comic relief but a cameo by Jonah Hill made me lose it. Jonah hill was part of a gang that I think was supposed to be the KKK and the entire scene was just fun to watch. I saw him and my first thought was, Oh no, why is he going to ruin this movie. Thankfully it was just a cameo and it fit perfectly. The rest of the movie had its laughs and its moments that I won't soon forget. When you see a Tarintino film you can expect a strange soundtrack. Kill Bill had a great soundtrack that had a lot to do with culture and the scenes provided. The opening credits had a strange western song with the lyrics saying Django over and over again. I was pleased to see I was going to get what I wanted. I say it time and time again, music makes the movie and in Django Unchained, the music makes this a better movie. During the action sequences there was one or two times that rap music was playing and it kind of fit but I didn't like it. It took me out of the moment. I was so into this movie and I felt like I was really there but there was no rap music in the 1800s so it almost ruined the moment. People can find this movie really offensive. I really don't know why but I decided to count how many times they said the N word. I counted 101. Websites say 100+ or 110, but I counted 101 and I'm sticking to it. People are mad at Tarintino for doing this but it is the time period. It was how America was at the time. It isn't offensive, it's accurate. People also thought this movie was too long. Its 165 minutes, almost three hours, but in my opinion there is no such thing as too long a movie. I could have sat in that theatre for three more hours if t let me enjoy the masterpiece I was watching. I understand it s uncomfortable sitting n a movie theatre seat for a really long time but when I'm in the comfort of my own home I never want a movie to end. Overall, Django Unchained was a movie I'm not going to forget anytime soon. The action was scattered thorough out the movie but really exploded in the final act. The dialog was comical and clever. The music was mostly fantastic. The acting was Oscar worthy and it was highly entertaining. Go see this movie because it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",

Littered with award worthy performances from practically every other character and moments of side hurting laughter everything works, and even that feels like I'm not doing the film enough justice. The finale despite the personally jarring Tupac soundtrack was flair personified, and a fitting end, stylish and elegant this is quite possibly one of the greatest \"origin\" stories.

            "content": "I just watched Django UnchainedI do not think it's is one of Tarantino's best, but I really do like it.One of the great strengths of Quentin Tarantino's films is the way his love of cinema comes through in every single frame. From the old fashioned Columbia logo at the beginning, the '70s-style opening credit or the subtle lines and in-jokes (You may only catch second or third time around) to more obvious nods, that are all a joy.Over the years, we have come to expect things from Tarantino, and he delivers most of them in Django Unchained. There are the brutal action scenes, and when someone gets shot, boy do they bleed. We're bound to see female bare feet at some point. And you know it will end in what I can only describe as satisfying violence. I think the only thing really missing is Tarantino's witty, quotable dialogue and clever monologues. There's a little of it here, but not as much as usual.Dicaprio steals the movie as the villain. He owns every single scene he is in. Fox's is the best he had been since Ray and had great chemistry with Waltz, who is as fabulous as always.Despite the western/revenge flick theme of the movie, this movie has some serious laugh out loud moments (especially when Samuel L Jackson realises DiCaprio intends to let Django sleep in the big house). That said, this is a serious movie though with some serious things to say about how blacks were treated in the Old South.I will say this though, Tarantino should never attempt an Australian accent again.Django Unchained is Tarantino's highest grossing movie, as it grossed $162 million (against a $100 million budget) at the domestic box office.",

            "content": "An unlikely friendship develops between a 1850s slave and a German- born bounty hunter who frees him to assist with tracking down three wanted men in this Quentin Tarantino western. The gradual bond between the pair always feels very real, though the plot is more complicated than just that as the partners plan an ambitious quest to rescue the slave's wife from a sadistic plantation owner, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Jumping between serious drama and quirky comedy (ambushers bantering about the bags on their head), it is easy to see why the film might not jive with everyone's sensibilities, but there is a lot to like about the complex characters as well as the way Tarantino generates laughs in a story about one of the ugliest parts of American history. Christoph Waltz is superb as the German bounty hunter, and not just due to delivering excellent comic relief. He is a true outsider in the racist America of the 1850s, and his character's growing disgust with the way slaves are treated really resonates; much like Oskar Schindler's character progression, he may have initially been into killing slave traders for the profits, but by the final hour of the film, there is much more passion to it. Some have been critical of the film's very violent third act, but if nothing else, it comes off well as a response to DiCaprio's questions about submissiveness and the film concludes on a surefire memorable note.",

            "content": "Inglorious Basterds is one of my favorite movies of all time, so I was shocked by how bad this movie was. It's comparable to the dreadful Death Proof, only difference, that movie was meant as a joke, I think..Tarantino can't be serious with this film. It desperately tries to shock you with gory violence yet manages to be extremely boring and lackluster throughout. The pacing and editing of this movie are dreadful. Basically it holds up well for some minutes until they kill the sheriff. From there on an already weak script collapses into random and drawn out scenes and a confusing, unfocused whole.When they get to Candyland you are already wondering why the Waltz character is risking his life to free Djangos girl. Since the script is dull and there's no chemistry between the men. Django manages to be a completely pointless and bland character throughout the movie, you don't care about him or his quest, and that's the movie's biggest shortcoming.I won't blame the actors since I think they're doing their best with awful script and lackluster directing. The Di Caprio character gets introduced in a disgusting and tasteless scene where one slave is poking the eyes out of another. I normally have no problem with violence in movies when it's done for a REASON. Here it's just pointless and in your face without doing anything for the story. The same goes for the use of the n-word. I doubt that even in slavery times they would use the word every 2 SECONDS throughout the movie. And what's with the stupid names, King Schultz, Broomhilda von Schaft, Calvin Candie, Big Daddy, I mean it sounds like something a 5 year-old would come up with. If I was black I would definitely get offended by this piece of trash. The movie critics and general audience praise for this movie only further proves that most people are sheep that want to be told what to like. I seriously felt like in the movie Idiocracy with people in the audience laughing every two seconds when the n-word was used. Not even the soundtrack is good this time around. I don't know what QT has been smoking lately but the soundtrack is an inappropriate mess with different styles wildely mixed together. That QT could go from the fantastic Inglorious Basterds to this pile of trash is beyond comprehension. I guess it just goes to show nobody's perfect, even though movie critics and fanboys alike will desperately make them out to be. Basterds had an intelligent script, great acting in different languages, solid directing and editing, suspenseful scenes, a truly fresh and original feel. The 2 and a half hours just rushed through and when it was finished you wanted to see it again. The characters felt genuine and likable and you actually cared when something happened to them. This movie has NONE of that, the German scenes with Broomhilda are weird and completely out of place, thrown in just for some shits and giggles. The Candyland scenario was drawn out beyond belief and I kept looking at my watch waiting for the terrible experience to be over with. This movie is a confused mess, nuff said, spare yourself the money and the torture of sitting through what will feel like the longest three hours of your life. And I will never listen to a movie critic or IMDb rating ever again...",

I've only come across him a couple of times before, but his quirky German characteristics were really quite charming and brilliant in this film.Jamie Foxx also did well, which surprised me as I'm not a fan of his usually.To be fair the whole cast did a good job and the film overall was far better than I had ever expected.I have been inundated with Westerns lately, whether it be as part of the films to watch on the Top 100 lists or TV and even the latest book I picked up, the genre suddenly seems to be everywhere and I'm not someone that watches Westerns as a rule, so it's been a bit frustrating.It was therefore a pleasant change of pace for me to actually enjoy this one as much as I did.There were the typically Tarantino elements that were a tad over the top in the gruesome stakes, as far as my cry baby ass was concerned, but I thoroughly appreciated the story.It felt like it was a version of '12 Years A Slave' if Chewetel had got some sort of justice in the end.I didn't actually know that this one was about slavery when I started to watch it. I don't tend to read synopsis' or watch trailers, because I'd rather come to things with no expectations. As such that racist and brutal element was quite a shock for me and always unpleasant. I've never understood why people can't all just be nice to each other and why anyone could believe that another human is a lesser life form because of the colour of their skin or their inclinations, religion or anything else. Judge people because they're stupid, not because they're ginger or gay! But then show those stupid people how to behave and learn intelligence.So the subject matter wasn't to my liking, but I can clearly see that the film was well written, produced and directed.And the appropriate way that it was filmed in a more traditional cowboy film way gave it the right feel, but yet it was also brought up to date, without ruining what he was trying to achieve with the film as an historical piece. Quentin didn't take it too far, which I was pleased to see.I also liked the soundtrack, with the slow introduction of more modern tunes as it progressed.I would actually recommend this film to all sorts of people and it may be the highest rated Western on my list of films watched. It showed up some of the errors of the worlds past and almost seemed to be trying to make amends for some of that, with each of Django's achievements and lawful pursuits. It's not for the faint hearted though.839.09/1000.",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino, the man likes to push boundaries. Django Unchained is not an easy watch. Foul characters are many, taboo speech is thrust upon us constantly and violence is abundant. But all the while, it's just so damn stylish. Tarantino is in complete control throughout. He knows exactly what he's about in every scene and makes sure you always know you're witnessing one of his films from minute one through to minute 165 (yes, even during the credits he's still up to his old tricks).The story, set in 1858 (two years prior to the Civil War), follows a German bounty hunter who frees a slave named Django, and the journey the two take to free his enslaved wife. The brutality of the times is never hidden, or even danced around. We're shown it as it was and you have to admire that. The 'N' word is thrown around a multitude of times. At first it's reasonably shocking to hear the comfort with which the characters throw it about, however by the end you're pretty accustomed to it. It's just the way it was. There's an element of heartbreak for the audience seeing the way these people were treated, probably the clinching factor that got it a well deserved Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards.The acting is nothing short of brilliant from all involved (even Tarantino himself). Christoph Waltz steals the show for me, reminiscent of Inglorious Basterds. He's such an unlikely hero, but he's just so likable that you can't help but love him (or if he's playing a Nazi, admire the hell out of his performance). Jamie Foxx was truly excellent, as was Leo DiCaprio, but the real surprise for me was Samuel L. Jackson. I don't know how Tarantino does it but he gets the best out of that man every time. If only he had directed Snakes on a Plane.Django Unchained is a must see movie. It doesn't matter if you're worried about whether you'll be able to handle the violence or the tough themes, you have to put those worries to one side, grit your teeth and get to your local theater. It might not be easy to sit through, but boy is it rewarding at the end.",

Quentin truly spells freedom with the kind of people he uses in films, including inglorious Basterds and so on, so forth.I don't know how he does it, how he manages or conveys his message to actors to what needs to be done rather than what he wants. Any Tom dick harry can wear the shoes of the actors in this film, but Quentin knows how to tap their soul. I don't expect anything better from the actors in this film, ever, unless of course Quentin takes them in other films.The film's value is like watching a pirated version of it in theater.

He shows here that he is no one trick pony, as he and Foxx own the screen for almost its' entire two hour and forty five minute running length. Leonardo DiCaprio shows up as a vicious plantation owner, and he is the perfect villain. Be prepared for inhuman brutality, including a scene with attack dogs that will turn your stomach. However, it is necessary to show the reality of America's unforgivable history. Fox and Waltz are as good a pair as I have ever seen and Samuel L. Jackson shows up about 2/3 of the way in as a right hand man, or house n*****, a term used frequently, and causing some controversy as politically incorrect.

Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz are perfect in their roles, bringing that old movie magic where you really root for the good guys.

The songs really added to the story and increased the entertainment level. It all really set the necessary mood through the movie, whether it be the comical parts or the intense parts. The only real issue to find is the length of the movie. Three hours is long, but honestly bearable because of how well the story fit together and moved along. There were no dull moments as the storyline just kept getting more and more exciting. The movie is long, but every minute is needed to get the full experience. Great movie, 10/10.",

            "content": "This is a weird, uneasy, drone-on of a movie filled with odd characters, off-kilter acting, and excessive bloody violence. It also has a run time of over two and a half hours due in part to the fact that individual scenes go on and on and on. It seems to be a parody, a satire, and a comedy but I am not sure. For me, this movie doesn't feel as if it has a strong sense of what it wants to be. If it is a comedy and a send up it is unclear as to what it is parodying. Is it the history of the old south entrenched in sadistic racism? Or is it parodying movie westerns with an updated violence-drenched plot? If it is a comedy, the laughs are few and far between - unless one is supposed to laugh at all the excess. Or maybe it is just an excuse to have some gory fun in the context of a parody and really isn't meant to be taken too seriously. But it seems to me to be an odd pairing to use horrors of American slavery and man's unspeakable inhumanity to man as mere background dressing for either parody or broad comedy. Whatever the intent, the end product just doesn't gel into anything meaningful and is only mildly entertaining at best. Given the odd structure it is hard to feel anything for the characters, and given the gory bloodbath at the end of the film, one can only assume that the blood bath is supposed to be entertaining. As I said, a weird movie experience and not exactly family fun. For the most part, the actors willingly participate in the Director's nonsensical excesses. Leonardo's character can't say a line without chewing up the scenery, and Morgan Freeman's Candyland seems to have come from the school of bug-eyed stereotypical acting of the fifties. The best part of the film is Christoph Waltz who brings a much-needed conviction and purpose to this film.",

            "content": "Having been hugely underwhelmed with Death Proof which was Tarantino's previous effort to Django Unchained, I wasn't in any particular rush to see this film. Even though this film has a current IMDb rating of 8.5 and a metascore of 81 (meaning it is generally held in high esteem by both the viewing public and critics alike), I still decided to approach it with caution. Whilst, it's far from perfect I did find it to be reasonably enjoyable.The start of the film is great and Tarantino is clearly paying some sort of homage to the Western genre (in fact, one could easily believe that they're watching a spaghetti western when the film begins). I also thought that this film was fairly humorous on the whole - subtle gags like Django's surname being Freeman, Schultz's horse nodding whenever Schultz introduces him to anyone. I actually though that the first 45 minutes or so of this film were really good and these first 45 minutes are easily the strongest aspect of this film.Where the film falters slightly is in the middle section when Django and Schultz are introduced to Calvin Candle. This particular section was far too long and drawn out and the film noticeably loses momentum in the middle. This isn't helped by the fact that the running time of this film is 160 minutes which is far too long given the plot of this film (it could have been trimmed by 30 minutes or so without it affecting the film as a whole). Like a lot of Tarantino's films, this film combines humorous dialogue with brutal violence. It's a mix that I generally like in most of his films, but I must admit to feeling a bit dirty about the brutal treatment of slaves seemingly being done for laughs - it just doesn't feel right to me.What really saves this film are the performances from the principal cast; Foxx is fairly low-key for the majority of the film, but does get to flex his acting chops in the latter stages of the film. Waltz was excellent and funny, but also in a low-key way. Di Caprio was over the top and ridiculous (much like he was in The Wolf of Wall Street), but he certainly brought a bit of life to the film. Jackson was almost unrecognisable and also put in a solid performance. Direction and cinematography were also top-notch.The final shoot out in this film was completely ridiculous and did cheapen the film slightly, but for me it was bad in a way that was still quite funny so it's not a major criticism. Tarantino has a cameo in this film and presumably, unintentionally, reminds us once again that he is much better behind the camera than in front of it.A mixed bag of a film really, but it is one that hits more than it misses. It isn't a perfect film, it's ridiculously overrated, over-long, and it does sag a bit in the middle. However, it is reasonably enjoyable for the most part.",

            "content": "To the surprise of no one, Django Unchained is an essentially Tarantino love letter to a genre that's been left sadly underutilized over recent decades. It's every bit a straightforward action / revenge picture, with debts owed to the dozens of Leone & company spaghetti westerns that populated theaters in the sixties and seventies. The central plot is thread-bare - several of Pulp Fiction's competing story lines have quite a bit more depth - but surprisingly never really feels like it lingers or oversteps its bounds, even as the runtime approaches three hours. Eyes-forward escapism is the message of the day, and Django scratches that itch with vigor. It's a tale that, despite an egregious body count and a comical amount of gory debauchery, doesn't take itself too seriously and is inexplicably able to draw hearty laughs from moments that would have been downright chilling in another director's hands. The key role players are almost unanimously entertaining; DiCaprio as the smarmy, loathsome plantation owner, Jackson as his savvy right-hand man, Foxx as the blunt instrument of justice... they all play one note, but it's flawlessly tuned. The real show-stealer, once again, is Christoph Waltz, whose grinning, man-of-the-world bounty hunter fuels the majority of the fire. Although his role is a polar opposite to the slimy Nazi turncoat he portrayed in Inglourious Basterds, it's no less memorable and the picture sags noticeably when he isn't on the screen. Tarantino has turned in smarter efforts, carved deeper characters and written sharper dialog, but he's rarely been this indulgently entertaining. I loved the experience, especially in a theaterful of similarly-humored moviegoers, and can't wait to ingest the subtleties on my own when it's released for home viewing.",

            "content": "From Quentin Tarantino, the director of many great masterpieces comes a movie that totally KICKS ASS.The story is a solid Grade A story, with all the humour, suspense and gore and excitement that you could ever wish for in a Tarantino picture. The story revolves around Django, a recently freed slave who teams up with German dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz, together, the two track down several bounties and slave traders until they come across ruthless villain Calvin Candie, who is keeping Django's wife, Broomhilda at his Plantation. Similar to 'INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS', the story is able to stretch into a 2hr film. It may seem like a chore to sit through this film, but, I assure you, it is worth it. The characters just draw you into the story, so you can't switch off. You must finish it. Speaking of characters, Django is your typical hero, one that you sympathise with, he may not speak many lines, but Jamie Foxx's performance and Tarantino's writing creates a perfectly endearing character. Kerry Washington as Django's 'ball and chain', Broomhilda Von Schaft is also a good lead, and a fantastic female character. She doesn't have much screen time, but when she's on screen with Django you are thankful that Django and King are their to save her.They, however, are upstaged by the supporting cast; Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. Waltz is brilliantly likable as Dr. Schultz, he acts as a perfect mentor and friend to Django, while also appearing to be quite neurotic, switching from calm, collected and friendly to a gun- toting psychopath. Waltz likable dentist is suited perfectly against the two villains, Calvin Candie and his loyal house slave, Stephen. DiCaprio and Jackson play such despicable people, yet they're SO funny at the same time, that you can't help but love every second they're on screen. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is absolutely incredible, and mixes well with Tarantino's ultra violence and the Western tone.I suppose my very minor gripe with the film is that it does drag on just a little bit, but that's what you get when you want to see a Tarantino film. It's cool, fun and leaves a satisfying taste in your mouth. Django is off the chain.'DJANGO UNCHAINED' Written and Directed by: Quentin Tarantino Starring: Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Samuel L.

            "review_title": "This \"Django\" is most definitely \"Unchained\"!",
            "content": "Quentin Tarantino.If that name means nothing to you, just move on.10 years ago, in 2004, I had the great pleasure to watch Tarantino's epic revenge fantasy \"Kill Bill\" (2003-2004) (yes, it is one film, split into two parts). I proclaimed \"Kill Bill\" to be Tarantino's best work as a director (yes, even better than \"Pulp Fiction\" - his most famous film to date). (I've always considered Quentin Tarantino to be a far better screenwriter than a director, hence why the 1993 Tony Scott-directed action film \"True Romance\" - which Tarantino wrote the screenplay for but DID NOT direct - is my all-time favorite movie, and the single best piece of cinema that Tarantino has ever been involved with. There, I said it - \"True Romance\" is Tarantino's greatest work to date.)I saw \"Kill Bill\" as his best work because it represented a celebration of film - the very thing Tarantino loves to death and is, after all, the industry that employs him - a cinematic culmination of thousands of hours of late-night grind-house cinema outings when Tarantino was a highly impressionable teenager growing up during the 1970s. If you have a thing for martial arts movies, \"spaghetti\" Westerns, Japanese and Italian horror films, Japanese animation (Anime') and virtually every single revenge movie ever made, you were in heaven. I know I was, which is why I loved it as much as I did.It's been a while since Tarantino has made another film that I was really interested in watching, that was until I finally saw \"Django Unchained,\" which he wrote and directed and was released in 2012. I missed my chance to see it in the theaters, but fate allowed me to buy the movie on DVD and I just completed watching it this morning.In short, \"Django Unchained\" is yet another celebration of film from Tarantino. Combining the \"spaghetti\" Western (made most famous by the late Italian director Sergio Leone and his \"Dollars\" trilogy which featured a young-ish Clint Eastwood in the leads) and the blaxploitation and soul flicks of the '70s, \"Django Unchained\" is the type of film I've been yearning for a LONG time: a Western film with a blaxploitation attitude. Anyone who knows Tarantino, knows that he has a deep affection, and appreciation for, black culture and black cinema, so why else would he make a movie featuring a black-American protagonist leading an insurrection in the years leading up to the American Civil War?Now here is where we get personal for this viewer. As a person of color (black-American), I got a perverse pleasure from watching \"Django Unchained.\" This movie caused quite a bit of controversy at the time of its release, namely because of its repetitive use of the word \"ni**er,\" much to the consternation of fellow filmmaker Spike Lee (even though he admitted he had not yet seen the film). I fully understand Lee's point and can understand his frustration, but from watching the movie I KNOW that Tarantino detests slavery as much as anyone else (as much as anyone with even the slightest bit of common sense), which is why he doesn't shy away from the brutal reality of the times (the film's opening sequence featuring black slaves force-marched through Texas proves this point). But like typical Tarantino, he also finds a sense of perverse humor in mocking the pathetic conventional racial wisdom of the times and even in displaying the full-on horrors of slavery, is still able to solicit many, many well-placed laughs (take for instance, a hilarious sequence featuring the Ku Klux Klan - the KKK).Tarantino's perverse humor and sudden, explosive sequences of lurid, highly stylized bloodshed are right at home here. In 1858, two years before the official start of the American Civil War, German bounty hunter - and former dentist - Dr. King Schultz (Academy Award-Winner for Best Supporting Actor Christoph Waltz) stumbles upon and frees hardened slave Django (Jamie Foxx). Now here is where we get personal again: in Foxx's Django, I found myself the unlikely - yet fully willing, and committed - target member of Tarantino's audience, and Foxx's Django acting out a wild wish-fulfillment fantasy in a former slave-turned-gun-slinging-insurrectionist. In short, I wished I could be Django, the former slave who's a cross between Nat Turner and Clint Eastwood's \"Man With No Name\" (from Sergio Leone's \"Dollars\" trilogy, remember).Schultz needs assistance in collecting a hefty bounty and lucky for him, Django - who is much wiser than he appears - can help him to positively locate and identify the men he's looking for. In exchange, Schultz will also help Django in locating his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who works as a servant for Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), an uber-wealthy Mississippi plantation owner who is as vile for his treatment of his slaves as he is lovable for his Southern charm, hospitality, and business ethics. The big joke here, of course, and in true Tarantino fashion, is Candie's house servant Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson, under some pretty heavy prosthetics to appear considerably aged), who quickly catches on to Django and Schultz's scheme.Now here is a movie that truly, totally, won over this viewer - \"Django Unchained.\" In true Tarantino fashion, he's having a ball here, with his rich and over-sized characters and dialogue, and when pushed into a corner he retreats to his favorite - a bloodbath (one that's straight out of \"The Wild Bunch\"!) - toward the end. But unlike his previous shoot-outs, you get a great sense of satisfaction from the blood and carnage, one that makes you realize that fully deserving foes have been truly vanquished and that good has triumphed over a great evil and injustice. In short, \"Django\" has become \"Unchained,\" a symbol of a time of insurrection BEFORE a time of an even Greater Insurrection (the Civil Rights Movement, which would take place a full century after this film's historically revised events).10/10",

            "content": "\u00a8Gentlemen, you had my curiosity, but now you have my attention.\u00a8I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan and enjoy his movies very much so I had huge expectations for this film and I wasn't disappointed. Django Unchained is one of the top five best films of the year and deserves all the awards it has been receiving. Is this Tarantino's best work? No it isn't, but that doesn't mean this isn't a fun film to watch. It has several flaws; the movie feels messy and a little overlong at times with some editing issues, but the story is just so fun that it's worth it. Inspired by the Spaghetti westerns that Tarantino grew up watching, he pays homage to those films with Django Unchained. Just like those spaghetti westerns ended up reinventing a genre that was dying, in a way Tarantino has reinvented a genre now that had been long forgotten. We've seen very few westerns come out in the last decade (my favorites being 3:10 to Yuma and True Grit), but none as gritty and dark like this one. It is a western mixed with Tarantino's classic dark and violent trademarks. Tarantino actually defines this film more a southern than a western considering it takes place in the South pre Civil War era, and it truly is worth the watch. Django Unchained has some great performances as well; it was a surprise to see Leonardo DiCaprio playing such a vicious and ruthless role, Samuel Jackson also nails his role as DiCaprio's adviser, Foxx takes a while to settle in the lead role but he does deliver halfway through the film, and then there was Christoph Waltz who was the highlight of the film for me. Waltz had already surprised film lovers with his Oscar winning performance in Inglorious Basterds, and here he surprises us once again although this time playing the hero instead of the villain. In my opinion his character carries this movie and shouldn't even be considered as the supporting character, but rather the leading one. He is a delight to watch on screen and is truly magnificent. Who would have thought that he could play such a likable character after seeing him in the despicable and vicious role in Tarantino's previous movie?This is one of Tarantino's most straightforward films with hardly any flashbacks, and it isn't divided into chapters either like his other movies. The story opens somewhere in Texas during the pre-civil war era where we see Django (Jamie Foxx) being carried off in chains towards a slave market along with some other folks. They are interrupted by a former dentist, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), who has come to free Django. He is very much against slavery and racial segregation, so he buys Django his freedom with the condition that he help him find three brothers who are wanted men, and only Django has seen their faces. Schultz isn't working as a dentist; he has found a much more profitable living as a bounty hunter so he teams up with Django who is more than willing to help find these men who abused his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) and sold her to a ruthless plantation owner down in Mississippi known as Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Django and Schultz become such good friends that they become partners in the bounty business and later the Dr. agrees to help Django on his quest to free his wife from Candie. It won't be an easy task so they have to come up with a plan first, but Schultz is so inspired by Django's love for his wife that he agrees to help him. In Candie's gigantic residence we are introduced to some new characters such as his loyal adviser, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) who is in charge of all the slaves and household duties, and several other employees of Candie. One thing is for sure, freeing Broomhilda from all these men won't be an easy task. My major complain (although it really is a minor one because I did love this film) is that it runs a bit too long. I thought the climax was reaching its highest point at least 30 minutes before the ending, and it did hurt the movie a bit that it extended itself. Tarantino is a master at creating tension and suspense, and he does it once again here, but he could have ended the film there instead of including another act where he has a small role as an Australian that just doesn't work. The film is very violent, but Tarantino always finds a way to make you laugh (a task that isn't easy) with a smart and inventive script. Racial abuse is pointed out here in a very strong way similar to when Tarantino showed the Nazi's abusing the Jews in Inglorious Basterds. The excess in racial abuse is very clear and can be hard to watch for some, but it has a powerful effect, especially thanks to DiCaprio's portrayal as the vicious and abusive slave owner. The real star of the film however is Christoph Waltz who really makes this film a lot more fun. It was one of my favorite performances of the year. Django Unchained may have just reinvented the western genre altogether with this inventive Tarantino script. The ending might be pretty predictable for a Tarantino fan, but the entire ride was just so exciting and such a fun experience. I agree with what A.O. Scott said about the film: \u00a8 It is digressive, jokey, giddily brutal and ferociously profane. But it is also a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism.\u00a8 This is one of the most entertaining movies of the year, but it could be divisive for some.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

Christoph Waltz is outstanding, and by all means the best actor in the film. His role and character fit so well with him and his personality, that is easy for him to get lost in it, and quite impressive as well. Besides Waltz's very earned Oscar awarded performance, Jamie Foxx also proves to be an excellent actor in the film as well, providing one of his best performances in recent years. The film is very cleverly written, and somehow excellently paced. The cinematography is interesting and excellent, and the costumes, music, and atmosphere of the film fit oh so right. The film never leaves you wanting more, or having seen too much, it just feels right, and props to Tarantino for making it so enjoyable. The film is massively entertaining, quite funny, and absolutely raw with action. In the end, Django Unchained is a near masterpiece- and an absolute joy to watch. It's performances are often breathtaking, especially from Waltz, and its writing is excellent- as well as any atmospheric parts about it. In my opinion, it is one of, if not, the best film Tarantino has ever made, and an impressive feat to match.\nMy Rating: 10/10",

I mean for the last 50 minutes I was getting ready to leave: now they do that and here's the happy ending.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",

This movie is very good at entertaining the viewers and at the same time showing them the cruelty of slavery that makes you doubt humanity. Watching the perfect portrayal of Django, Von Schaft, Candie, Stephen,And especially Dr.Schulz who is so awesome you can't believe it. And like in every Tarantino movie one of the main characters dies to soon in this case it's sadly Dr. Schulz and also in this movie is the quirky Tarantino humor that we all love. I can only recommend this movie to Tarantino, Western or only casual movie lovers, OK, who am I kidding? Everybody should watch this movie.",

            "content": "I'm sick to death of highly anticipated movies failing to perfect their genre. Lincoln failed immensely in presenting the civil war/slavery debate, albeit Lewis's great performance. Silver Linings Playbook attempted to provide a genuine romantic comedy/drama, but instead ended up as an incredibly predictable and clich\u00e9 typical Hollywood flick. The Master presented a poor second half, despite PTA's strong history of phenomenal film. Argo was very average, with two dimensional characters and an incredibly over dramatisation of a true story. Get my drift? I was not impressed at all this year. Quentin Tarantino was my only hope to put something solid, something special into the list of films in the past year (although I have yet to watch Amour). The only people who diss this movie will be those who think it is unnecessarily violent or pointless in dialogue. But the truth is, it has witty dialogue that keeps you entertained from start to finish and sudden and gruesome violence almost to the extent of comedy. It doesn't set out to be truthful, romantic, historical or anything like that. It sets out to be different and succeeds on all points. Tarantino has done an amazing job in coming up with something new, albeit similar despite his many past successes. After making movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, True Romance, Inglorious Basterds, Jackie Brown etc it's difficult to continue making the same quality of movie, but with a different plot, dialogue and characters. Dare I say it, Tarantino has impressed me with his continuing excellence (albeit some may call it carelessness, I call it carefully thought of and crafted MESSY art).It's movie of the year in my eyes. It won't win Best Picture because it just jokes about slavery and the Academy wouldn't dare allow such a movie to win, I'm surprised to see it nominated. But forget the Oscars. This is the movie of the year. Waltz deserved his Oscar nom and Globe Win, Leo got thieved yet again, unlucky for him I guess.",

There has been a lot of press about the 'racist' aspect of this movie. I think most sane people will argue that racism is a bad thing, but there is a subtle difference in a film that is actually racist and a film that is about racism. No one (at least no one with a brain) denies that the slave trade was a dark chapter in this country's past, and this movie acknowledges this fact. Most of the white people in the movie are repulsive characters, and Django is one of the smartest characters in the movie. He seems dumb at first, but that's because he hasn't been taught anything during his life of servitude. The ability to learn is what makes a person smart.",

Let me say up front that I love westerns, always have, always will and in my humble but accurate opinion, there hasn't been a truly great western made in a very long time. Well the spell is broken and Django unchained is setting the bar pretty darn high for any wanna-bees to follow. Quentin Tarantino shows why he is considered one of the best writers/directors in show business today. It would be a mistake not to praise the outstanding work by both Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz, to say their portrayal of an ex-slave turned bounty hunter and ex-dentist turned bounty hunter was exceptional would be an understatement. Also another wonderful performance from the ever consistent Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of a cruel plantation slave owner. Listen, this movie is a must see adventure western, yes there is plenty of blood and guts but you've got to expect that with Quentin Tarantino films, this is such an unique step back into the pre-civil war slave era, to miss this journey and saga would be a big mistake.",

The difference is, unlike Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, these movies are based on slavery and holocaust. It is probably to gain love in Jewish and Black communities, but it just turns the movies sour.You probably all know why inglorious bastards sucked, there was not so good casting. The bad guys were just bad guys and good guys thought that killing bad guys was the only option. There was no in-depth plot. Although, I must admit that the German guy that is at the beginning and at the end is a very interesting character.As to Django, again, we get a very good performance from the 'bad guy' in this case Leonardo Di Caprio. As to the main characters they are just too plain, there is an ambition to have a very good performance for the German guy, but whoever the actor is certainly does not deliver. As to Jamie Foxx, he is OK, but his character is pretty weird.And most importantly, all these stupid 1 vs 40 fights that end with 40 guys dead are just inconceivable.I know that this movie received very good reviews, but I guess that is because nobody wanted to review a big budget movie against slave owners badly, just like nobody wanted to review a big budget movie against Hitler badly.",

While \"Django\" isn't my favorite of Tarantino films, I still wholeheartedly believe it's a five star movie. It's intense, emotionally moving, exquisitely written and directed, and wonderfully acted; it's also a film I can watch again and again and never grow tired of. Django's journey is not for the light of heart; it has moments of horrible brutality and heartbreak, but it also has great moments of triumph. Those moments of triumph are elevated by the amount of work that went into crafting the characters of Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz, \"Alita Battle Angel\") and Django (Jamie Foxx, \"Collateral\"), whom quickly becomes one of the most dynamic protagonists of all of Tarantino's films.\nFor our full review of Django Unchained and hundreds of other reviews, articles and podcast episodes visit us at True Myth Media.",

            "content": "Nobody makes movies like Quentin Tarantino. I have seen almost everything he has produced (a deliberate exception was \"Death Proof\") and my personal favourites are \"Kill Bill\" Parts 1 & 2. Now he turns his talent to the western but, from the garish red of the opening credits, it's clear that this is more spaghetti western than the traditional territory of say John Wayne. Indeed the lead character is inspired by a 1966 film directed by Sergio Corbucci and part of Tarantino's homage to the earlier work is to provide a cameo role for Franco Nero who was the eponymous protagonist first time round.Some of the trademarks of Tarantino's distinctive style are to create novel characters while slipping in references to so many other movies (including his own). So here we have a German dentist (Christoph Waltz) and a black slave (Jamie Foxx) as the unlikely pair of gunslingers who ride to the unlikely-named slave plantation Candyland (Leonardo di Caprio as owner) to rescue the even more unlikely-named Broomhilde von Shaft (Kerry Washington). Another of Tarantino's quirks is his fascination with language and his set-piece conversational confrontations. In this movie, Waltz and di Caprio give brilliant performances as they duel linguistically and Samuel L Jackson is outstanding as a supreme version of the Uncle Tom character.Set in 1858 (two years before the outbreak of the American Civil War), this is a long film of two and three quarter hours, but it is deliciously entertaining if often disturbingly violent. Tarantino specialises in revenge, retribution and revisionism. In his last film \"Inglourious Basterds\", he offered us a vision of the Nazi leadership being wiped out rather than the Jews; here he allows a freed slave to be the nemesis of an outrageously racist and sadist slave owner while managing to turn hooded vigilantes into figures of fun. This is not a film that will be everyone's cup of tea (as we say in Britain) - or should we say goblet of gore - but most Tarantino fans will - like me - love it.",

When Quentin Tarantino was interviewed after he made this movie the interviewer asked him if he didn't think that his movies had too much violence. Tarantino replied, rather irritated, that society is much more violent. And he was utterly right of course. This movie has violence galore and lots of blood. But this violence is totally acceptable as real in the context of the story and you must not forget that slavery was in itself and in its daily events a constant huge violence. This is the story of a man who makes a living by being a bounty hunter (he killed bandits hunted up and down by justice to get the reward offered to whom delivered them dead or alive) who at a certain point takes as his assistant a slave called Django (Jamie Foxx who does a fine job at this part) freeing him after he helped him to find three of those bandits. After that the body hunter who was in fact a fine cultivated gentleman with some humane feelings (though trigger happy) decides to help Django to find his wife, another slave from whom he was forcibly separated in a slave auction. This leads them to a series of thrilling adventures very well shown in images, scenes, sequences and dialogues, showing a cast of very well depicted and presented characters with great performers. The sceneries, both interior and exterior, are excellent. Of course in this kind of movies there are also a few actual unlikelihoods (for instance the facility with which the shooter hits fully and precisely very distant targets which anyone who has for instance done military duties knows it is very difficult if not impossible and the facility with which the \"goody\" hero kills a crowd of villains supposedly as good shooters as himself and without even being hit himself). But in its whole it is a good movie indeed in terms of action, sceneries, cut, actors' direction and performing and screen-play carrying out with extremely dramatic scenes.",

What's even more interesting is that Django feels more linear than his other movies, though it still has all his trademarks like film-homages, use of preexisting music he likes, and dialogue that reflects the characters in very obvious yet subtle ways.Django Unchained is a historical Western that has the twist of a very talented director writing and directing the story, and then giving it a twisted take on it all, like Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy. This makes Django's violence satirical in comparison to the classic American Westerns of old, and goes that extra mile in making it about an African-American slave's desire for revenge: something unheard of for the genre.The whole experience is amazing, the scenery is great, and the screenplay very well thought-out from start-to-finish.

Jamie Foxx cuts a good figure, looks the part but his acting in this is bland and not memorable. QT again makes the mistake of putting himself in a cameo part to bad effect, he ruins the scene he is in and he can't act worth a damn.I guess the worst part is the lack of realism, the first half is totally believable, the second half turns into a sort of Kung Fu flying dragon mess with armies of guys on a plantation, a woman being blown back sideways by a single pistol shot from the wrong direction and Foxx blowing up an entire mansion in one shot with about 8 sticks of dynamite.The story was good and this could have been a great movie.

            "content": "I am an absolute Quentin Tarantino fan. 100%. So my comments on his 2012 \"Southern\" film might come across as a tad biased. Personally, I don't believe my views on Tarantino are biased. If he were to come out with a movie that I felt was horrible, I'd have no problem saying it. I just don't believe he's ever put out a movie that was less than \"good\" and I'd go so far as to declare DJANGO UNCHAINED one of his better movies. The movie has everything I've come to expect from one of his movies (great characters, brutal violence, sleek writing, etc.) and comes with the added bonus of being one of the few Westerns I can enjoy enough to watch over and over. The movie follows the tale of Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave in mid 19th century America who fate has separated from his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Resigned to a life of miserable servitude, Django's life changes for the better when he is approached and 'purchased' by the eccentric Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). Schultz is a bounty hunter and needs Django's assistance in searching for a team of slavers and promises, in return, to aid Django in locating Broomhilda and reuniting the two of them. It might have been a simple mission if Broomhilda hadn't been purchased by the infamous Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), owner of the largest and most feared plantation in the South: Candieland. Schultz and Django form a plan to gain entrance to Candieland and escape with Broomhilda, but this is a Tarantino movie so it's never that simple.It's tough for me to pin down what was so awesome about DJANGO UNCHAINED. There's a lot to love here. It's easier to point out what doesn't work, but that's because my complaints about the movie are minimal. I suppose the only real complaint I have about the movie is that, once Schultz and Django decide to work together in finding Broomhilda and freeing her, the movie feels like it grinds to a halt for a few minutes so we can enjoy a very Western montage of Django and Schultz bounty hunting through the winter. By this point, Django has already upheld his end of the bargain (helping Schultz locate the Brittle bros.) and we're on the verge of introducing our main villain (Candie) but the movie says, \"Wait! Let's show them riding horses and shooting guns for a few more minutes.\" Once you pass that hurdle, the movie ratchets up the pace again and continues on track for the rest of the film. I suppose this movie will get a lot of flack for the language, too. Tarantino's never been shy about dropping a few N-bombs in his movie but the context of this movie allows for some sort of world record on Tarantino's part. I'll admit, even as a white dude, it was uncomfortable at first when this movie started with the constant stream of racial slurs but this is a movie about slavery and, as unsettling as it might be, it sets a tone for the time period.Yeah, my problems are miniscule. That's because DJANGO UNCHAINED is pure awesomeness. Tarantino brings his trademark violence, eliminating any doubts that the movie might've toned it down within the first five minutes when Schultz 'negotiates' Django's purchase with the Speck brothers. Blood is shed in this movie\u0085in epic proportions. This might seriously be Tarantino's bloodiest film, if not on equal ground with KILL BILL \u2013 VOLUME I. No one does a modern revenge film like Tarantino and he makes sure every hit is brutal. We're also treated to plenty of Tarantino's wicked dialogue. After this film and INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, I am a firm believer that Christoph Waltz was put on this Earth to act in Tarantino movies. No one, short of Samuel L. Jackson, has delivered Tarantino's sharp writing as perfectly as Waltz. His character, Schultz, steals the show just as much as Colonel Hans Landa did in 2009. It's no surprise to me that he one a second Oscar for his role here. He's so good, he almost eclipses anyone else in the film. And that's not to say the rest of the cast doesn't bring their A-game. Foxx is excellent as the title character. I've read in articles how the character was originally written with Will Smith in mind and I can't express how glad I am that he passed. This movie would not have been nearly the same with Smith in the lead role. Foxx is great, and so are the film's villains.The villains are almost always the coolest characters in Tarantino movies (e.g. Mr. Blonde, Ordell Robbie, Bill and his DeVAS, Stuntman Mike, and\u0085of course\u0085Landa). When I heard Leonardo DiCaprio had been cast as an evil plantation owner in Tarantino's movie, I knew we were in for a killer performance. I'm not sure that he's the greatest actor, but I love how he's willing to throw himself at some bizarre roles and embrace the characters. He is probably the last person I would envision as Calvin Candie but Tarantino saw something in the choice and he wasn't wrong. Candie is a Southern dandy, obsessed with French culture and mandingo fighting and fancying himself as a Southern gentleman. He's a firm believer in Southern hospitality and a successful businessman in the business of slave fighting. His main house slave is Stephen, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Stephen is a conniving manipulator and way more dangerous that he appears at first glance. I'd say it was probably one of the more daring roles Jackson's taken.There is a lot more to love about this movie, but there's limited space to rave about it. It looks amazing (both cinematography and production design), it sounds amazing (with the typical Tarantino soundtrack), and the story grabs you and doesn't let go. Long story short: another win for Tarantino.",

            "content": "Finally, Tarantino has created a film that he has been paying homage to for so many years. Django Unchained is Tarantino's 7th film and still hasn't lost his touch. Sadly Django Unchained is not perfect, as it has problems.Django Unchained follows the same approach that was applied to Kill Bill, driven by a clear end goal and uses a linear approach in telling it's story, despite a few flashbacks. Though similar, it is a major improvement from Kill Bill as Tarantino keeps our attention with it's quirky characters. Characters in this film are definitely a much needed depth, with a richer backstory, in comparison to his previous films. The film is definitely a big film, with a story that spans on long periods of time and creating personal growth for the protagonist. It would have been more interesting, if Django Unchained explores more of his personal and physical journey of becoming a bounty hunter. The film's dialogue is quite fun and it plays around with the dialogue found in classic Westerns. I did enjoy the fact that Tarantino has written two characters that clash in personality, Schultz and Candie, as their conversations with one another especially towards the end was thrilling to watch. Great dialogue is being written for Schultz and Candie as they represent the most over the top characters in the film, aside from Samuel L. Jackson's character.Django Unchained tackles the genre that Tarantino seems to be in love with the most, and it seems like this is a film he has always wanted to tell but because this is a Tarantino film, it doesn't stay on course with the traditional Westerns by exploiting a topic that is barely touched on in the genre or at least not commonplace within the mainstream films, slavery. This does make the film a bit controversial as not everyone can be comfortable with the topic and even to the point of being offended. Both Inglourious Basterds and this film, touch on history but they don't ever become a social commentary or it never places the situation on trial, rather it is just used as a backdrop. Tarantino avoids having his characters become a representation of the cultures within that era. If you want to watch a film that touches on these themes with depth and fueled by a message, then watch Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave, but if you want to see a fun film then watch Django Unchained. This film in a way follows Kill Bill's approach in it's story, with a clear end goal, but this film balances the style and substance much better with it being consisted throughout the entire film. Django Unchained strays away from Tarantino's common use of the non-linear narrative and leans on to the conventional 3 act approach but keeping it feeling fresh due to his style. There are 2 scenes that were done so well that they deserve a mention, these scenes are the KKK segment and the Dining Room scene with the principal characters.Robert Richardson returns to work with Tarantino and their collaboration always seems to give off positive results and this is mainly due to the understanding of each other's vision. Both have created a look that is reminiscent of the classic Westerns, using a warm palette to create the atmosphere and softer shots, in order to have the audience feel immersed to the era. The film also contains the quick zooms and close ups that were found in the films that this is paying homage to. With each subsequent film, Tarantino's budget and trust from the studios seem to rise which allows him to be ambitious in his work using multiple locations to film and build up faithful and detailed production sets. As the characters in this film have much more depth than Tarantino's previous film, the photography was able to convey that depth to these characters which then sells the character's motivations.Similarly to his previous film, Tarantino has taken a soundtrack approach rather than hiring a composer to create an original score for the film. The tracks he chose though are score driven and again chooses the tracks that are either from Morricone or at least similar. That does allow the film to feel like a Leone film at times. Tarantino interestingly enough has used Hip-Hop/Rap music on certain moments but it comes off more as humorous, which allows the audience to not take the film too seriously and maintaining that fun upbeat tone.Django Unchained may not be an ensemble film like Inglourious Basterds but this is due to the story being a bit more grounded and personal. Jamie Foxx as Django was a decent choice but he didn't really create something astonishing here with the character or maybe he was severely overshadowed by the acting performances from Waltz and DiCaprio. This is definitely the best that I have seen from Kerry Washington but it doesn't seem to be enough for me to highly appreciate it. Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio on the other hand was a stand out in this film delivering performances that will always be remembered when people look back at their filmography. Waltz was able to come off as charming which makes him so likable and he delivers his lines with amazing grace. DiCaprio creates this menacing character but at the same time able to give off a sense that he is a phony and a bit of a try hard. Samuel L Jackson was great in this, with an introduction to a character that will leave you surprised on how unlikable this person is.Django Unchained is a fun Western film that I have been waiting for him to make since he started his film career. It contains amazing performances and great direction from Quentin Tarantino. Yes, Django Unchained could have been better but it has enough great moments for this to be in the stronger side in the director's filmography.",

Owning a winning sense of humour, extreme amounts of blood and an epically performed story, what kind of Tarantino fans wouldn't love Django Unchained?It's very similar to most of the director's other films; there's brutality, language and a heavy theme. But unfortunately, this flick doesn't shy away from how unnecessarily prolonged and extended some of the scenes are. It's entertaining, but would honestly be better with subtracting around and hour. It's pretty clear that if you adore Quentin Tarantino's style, you'll appreciate this messy but moving story. Luckily, there's so much more than the draggy kind of pace.Waltz, DiCaprio, and Jackson are constantly amazing! The direction and writing is usually decent and every other element, such as the effects and music, is simply staggering. Although Django Unchained is another likeable tale relating to slavery, it's not enough to identify as the masterpiece other critics have stated it is.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

            "review_title": "Tarantino goes west",
            "content": "\"Django Unchained\" was noted director Quentin Tarantino's long anticipated foray into the western genre. As with 2009's \"Inglourious Basterds\", Tarantino took a decidedly revisionist approach to the subject matter. As a result, the movie is inspired as much by spaghetti western & exploitation movies as it is by traditional Hollywood westerns.The titular Django (Jamie Foxx) is a freed slave in the Antebellum South who teams up with a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) to track down and rescue his wife (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of a wealthy plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio). That's the plot in a nutshell but at two hours and 45 minutes, the movie ends up covering a lot of ground. Throughout that time there are several memorable episodes demonstrating Tarantino's knack for plotting and dialogue. It should also be noted that Tarantino's script earned him an Oscar (not to mention a Golden Globe & a BAFTA), so that should give some indication of its merit.Of course, a script is only as good as the actors that bring it to life. Luckily, in this case, the cast is exceptional. First and foremost are two supporting players - Christoph Waltz & Leonardo DiCaprio. Waltz earned his second Oscar (both for roles in Tarantino films) with his magnetic portrayal of charming bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Running a close second was Leonardo DiCaprio, as the also charming but equally malicious plantation owner Calvin J. Candie. It was a rare villainous turn for DiCaprio and one or his most memorable performances in a career studded with memorable performances. If star Jamie Foxx was outshone by these two actors it was only because he was merely very good rather than outstanding. The rest of the cast continued this level of excellence since even minor roles were filled with talented individuals. The movie brought together the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Kerry Washington, Don Johnson, Jonah Hill, Walton Goggins, Dennis Christopher, Michael Parks, Bruce Dern and, in a cameo role, the original Django himself, Franco Nero. What's not to like?There isn't much to complain about on the technical side, either. Tarantino can always be counted on for top-notch direction but a western presents its own set of challenges. Thankfully, the production design was very nicely handled, as was the costuming, though neither received any awards recognition. The soundtrack & score was also quite interesting, with its re-use of the theme from the 1966 movie \"Django\" along with some unique choices like Jim Croce's \"I Got a Name\" and \"Freedom\" by Richie Havens. If I have one complaint it's that I found that there were a few narrative quirks in the editing, which were probably unnecessary and/or out of place in a mostly traditional western.Ultimately, \"Django Unchained\" is pretty much what we've come to expect from Tarantino. Unapologetically violent, intricately plotted, well acted and artistically presented while remaining accessible. In my opinion, it ranks among Tarantino's most memorable. Of course, if you just don't like his style then this probably isn't the movie to convert you.",

I've seen the original and I loved it, I seen it many many years ago back when it was re-certified and re-released.I don't like Tarantino but on the request of a friend I decided to see it. I went in hoping, much like The Dark Knight Rises, hoping the movie would be good, I gave it a chance and I did not enjoy it, sure people will like it, I knew nothing going in other then it was a re-make or a homage to it, but I found it drawn out and so slowly paced that when the action finally did come I was to bored to enjoy it.The action, when it happens, is good, thats why I'm not saying this is an awful movie, as it was interesting.The filler between main plot points is drawn out to, it artificially extends the life of the movie by at least an hour and adds very little to the pacing other then to slow it down.I'll probably get grief over saying it but its my opinion. If you loved it then you loved it but if you like redone ideas, 100 things you've seen before and Tarantinos usual over the top blood effects then this movie is for you. You'd be far better watching the original, a far better story and superior pacing.",

The European 'spaghetti' western of the original Django (1966), blaxploitation and exploitation cinema from the 1970's and even comedy from the likes of Blazing Saddles(1974). Bringing them together in a great cinematic entertainment event.Typical themes of Tarantino's films (this is his seventh if you include Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 as one film) are of extreme bloody violence and shootouts, dialogue heavy scenes and long running times. I am pleased to report that all these tropes are here and I will expand on them individually.The film begins as a homage to the European 'spaghetti' western particularly Sergio Corbucci's Django (1966) complete with the title music from said film and indeed musical strings throughout the film.The cast includes Jamie Foxx as title character Django, who we see begin the film as a black slave in contrast to Franco Nero's ex-Union soldier turned drifter.We see Django become the 'property' of a German bounty hunter Dr. King (Christoph Waltz) who continues some great dialiogue heavy scenes ala his role as Nazi Colonel Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009).Other notable casting triumphs are Leonardo Di Caprio as Monsieur Candie a Mississipi cotton plantation owner who owns Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Di Caprio plays the role with great evil far moved from other roles I've seen him in over the years.Samuel L. Jackson continues great casting as Candie's head house slave Stephen Warren aged in 2012 when the film was released so heaven knows what he really looks like now!The film also delves into the subject of Mandingo fighting. Slaves are forced to fight to the death for their owners' wealth and entertainment. Controversial subject matter, but hey this is a Tarantino film.I mentioned Blazing Saddles earlier because their is a brief comedic scene featuring the Klux Klux Klan. During the film, Ku Klux Klan members gather at night to prepare for a violent raid. In the middle of their discussion, the ringleader fiddles with the eye holes in his mask, complaining that he can't see, and accidentally rips the fabric. As a result, the KKK adherents end up riding their horses aimlessly in circles.Their is the usual shoot out heavy scene featuring blood capsules galore. It is at the house of Candie and well and truly destroys a big house!The film has a long running time which does pass quickly because of ever changing scenes and interesting character's that keep you engrossed.My final observation was the cameo of Tarantino. Now I believe this let the film down and I have had to downgrade it one mark because of it! Tarantino actually ends up talking. Compare it with the understated cameos of say Hitchcock and you will catch my drift.All in all an excellent two and a half hours viewing entertainment.",

It has some great moments, and is fully watchable. I cannot say the movie as a whole is something I would consider great, but it definitely will keep you satisfied all the way through.The story is about a slave, who gets saved by a bounty hunter. The bounty hunter uses this slaves' knowledge to kill some men and collect the bounty. The work together on a few other killings, and then try to save the ex-slave's wife from an evil plantation owner. The movie ends happily ever after for the slave and his wife, but the others fall short.It's a watchable movie. I would really recommend a viewing.7 Stars",

            "content": "It's not hard to say Quentin Tarantino has been one of Hollywood's most respected directors in Hollywood since his first outing in 1992 with 'Reservoir Dogs', the violent crime-drama that placed this filmmaker in the cinematic spotlight prior to his magnum opus 'Pulp Fiction'. His signature use of innovative storytelling, sharp dialogue, and inventive parodying of classic Hollywood subgenres have driven him to being one of the most unique filmmakers working today. He's took an idiosyncratic twist on World War II on the German front in 2009's revenge fantasy 'Inglourious Basterds' as well as a stylish spin on the martial arts genre in 'Kill Bill' and it's sequel. Tarantino takes on the western genre in Django Unchained, a revisionist western film set in the Deep South that explores an audacious, yet darkly funny spin on the harrowing period of slavery during the Pre-Civil War era. Set in the 1850s, Jamie Foxx plays Django Freeman, an African American prisoner who is freed from slavery by a German bounty hunter and former dentist, Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz). The two embark on a journey across the South to Mississippi to save Django's wife Broomhilda (played by Kerry Washington), who is being held in slavery by sadistic plantation owner Calvin Candie (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) who has the loyalties from his trustful slave Stephen (played by Samuel L. Jackson). Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino doesn't go for the typical somber tone that often suites the atmosphere of dark historical fiction, particularly the entries dealing with slavery. Instead, he flourishes the story in the tongue-in-cheek fashion that sees the plot balancing between darkly funny and political inaccuracy. Most of this comes down to a plot following Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz, both of whom exhibit some sincere performances, on a solidly pace trek through the racism-ridden south that unsurprisingly for the Tarantino fare, turns into an overblown bloodbath. Aside from this, Tarantino grants his characters with sharp dialogue and gleefully dark humor that while has the capacity to provoke chuckles, often borders on the line between smart and exploitative. The same can easily to said about his use of graphic violence that erupts towards the film's final act. At the same time, Tarantino has the hefty hand to make it entertaining, if unapologetically insolent. The star that steals the biggest spotlight is the ever-popular Leonardo Dicaprio who deprives against his usual good guy image to portray a ruthless slave owner who gets trigger happy with dropping with N-word, forces slaves to engage in a gruesome wrestling match that makes the fist fights in 'Fight Club' look tame by comparison, and and pervades with an all-out racist attitude. His portrayal is bit edgy even for the darkly comedic territory, but it marks a definite high point for him in a trophy case of Oscar-caliber performances. Frequent Tarantino collaborator Samuel L. Jackson also shines in his irreverently fuuny role as Dicaprio's loyal servant, though largely unrecognizable with his heavy make-up used to give in an appearance of an old man making him only distinguishable by his signature voice. Django Unchained is a masterpiece! It shows a clear example that Quentin Tarantino is fantastic on taking on the western genre. However, this is quite bold and relentless on its political incorrectness making not for a solid choice for the faint of heart. Like most films about Tarantino, there is plenty of graphic violence and profanity, but if you're a big Tarantino, it should come to no surprise.",

But the Supporting actors came out as the big winners. Christoph Waltz was brilliant. His accent is an aspect you can't avoid. As I listened and watched him speak, it was poetry to my ears. He made Tarantino's great writing that much better! He brings great humor to such a brutal setting. Worthy of his Supporting Actor nomination. Leonardo DiCaprio amazed me in this film. He surprised me with his diversity in cinema. Nobody would expect he would put in the performance he did. He brings enough humor and over-the-top violence to make the film enjoyable but still light, especially when dealing with the topic of slavery in America. Confused that the Academy snubbed him with a nomination. Lastly, Samuel L Jackson was awesome! He portrayed a character nobody was expecting. To everyone, Calvin Candie ran 'Candie Land' but the audience sees it's true nature and notices that Jackson's character is the backbone of the whole operation. Great performance.The Score in this picture is one the best I've ever heard. It resembles the film perfectly! At times, it's as humorous as the writing then at times it brings great emotion to such a controversial topic. Excellent on all levels.I enjoyed every second of this film.

It lost its meaning, as the movie dragged on, with Django and Dr. Schultz whatever his name is continuously killing people. I felt like there was no emotion or story or background behind the scenes which kept occurring. Another point is the humor, i don't understand the necessity of adding a comedic sense to a film which is somewhat serious, we are talking about blacks being torched. If you compare this extremely boring average film to a 60's spaghetti wow, don't even. those movies back then had story, they ad character they had a purpose they were once easily to follow. These days there are too much talking and they spend too much time focusing on special effects rather than adding some emotion into the actual story and trying to forward to message to the viewer. Perhaps the end of the film was slightly entertaining with the shooting, but overall oh boy this movie absolutely sucked!",

From the blend of cultures and tales, to the improbability of the plots turns, the Stormtrooper effect-like ease with which non-major characters are defeated, and the scathing intensity of the villains, both of these parodical revenge-rescues flicks must be drawing largely from the same rich narrative traditions. Unsurprisingly, the character of Django is like Westly in many ways, from their unflappable confidence, to coming back from \"the dead\", and riding away victoriously on horseback from the fortresses they assaulted at the end. Gets fewer stars than I gave TPB simply because QT needs too much time to accomplish all of this and should learn to trim some epicardial fat.",

Tarantino delivers right out of the gate, right from the beginning credits to the soundtrack, to the acting, script, you name it. A very interesting take on the spaghetti-western that takes place two years before the Civil War. In one particular scene, early in the film we get to know our two main characters, Django (Jamie Foxx) and Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz). We are treated to a fleshing out of the cultural differences between the two characters by a simple device of visualization. While in a bar, Shultz, who is a bounty hunter, but a man of sophistication, explains to the slave-Django exactly why he needs him. As he talks to Django, Shultz, at the same time, is getting both of them a beer from the tap. Tarantino meticulously shows us close-ups and nice camera angles as Shultz pours the glass and wipes the foam off with a stick. It establishes the tone the film will take and shows why, whether you like him or not, why Tarantino is a modem day auteur. Great stuff.9.1 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB",

Nearly every character used the N word except the women and strangely Tarantino himself. I don't make notes about movies but I will stand corrected if someone who does disagrees. There are some faults. For instance, Tarantino's cameo.

            "content": "Django Unchained is killer fun. It's an embellished, original tale of devoted retribution set place in the seldom shown slavery stricken South, with an all too uncommon hero, Django, a freed black slave, who vies against a rarely represented adversary, Calvin Candie, a white southern plantation owner, allowing for a really altogether unconventional flick.Django Unchained is awesome, in one word, in two words, it's Quentin Tarantino. Quentin has done it again with Django. It has radical storytelling and is good-humored with slick action. Tarantino is a visionary with his camera-work. His writing and characters are genius.Django is acted greatly by star, Jamie Foxx. It's nice to see Foxx again put his talents to good use within the Django character as he brings out the best in himself. Waltz is ideal to play Dr. King Schultz, to spew Tarantino's clever speech. Christoph Waltz and Quentin Tarantino are a match made in heaven. Leonardo DiCaprio is truly awesome as Calvin Candie. Leo again proves that, if he hadn't already, that he is amongst the true elite of actors, the dozen or so best actors/actresses to ever act. Calvin Candie is one of the most loathed, or loved, villains of all-time. DiCaprio further strengthens his career. \"Now, WHERE IS MY BEAUTIFUL SISTER!\" Kerry Washington is great as Broomhilde even though she doesn't get to show off much. Samuel L. Jackson subsequently owns the show as Stephen. Stephen is the real villain of Django, and Calvin's just the candy.Django Unchained consists all of these A-1 film basics, these masterful movie elements, but they come in only small bursts. The film has a hard edit that is loose at the ends. It's not sharp enough as it shows as an incomplete editing job, missing more refinement. Django Unchained's primary storyline needed a healthier streaming singular focal point while at the same time it needed better supporting story structure as well. The main plot is too secondary unto the greater plot line of slavery, and thus, the film's a little unflattering. The best points of Django Unchained don't have enough proper framework. The splattering kill effects are very good for the movie, but I didn't get enough of it, up until the end when at which point it comes on too heavy. Django Unchained connects to the audience by self-referencing its viewing, and I enjoy it but it's instituted a tad untidily, and it became a little silly when Quentin himself showed up to say hello. The movie could have used more enhancing sound. The whole movie needed detailed polish. Pretty damn good though, with greatness like Quentin, you start at perfect and work your way down, opposed to vice versa.I'm careful not to over blow this in mind of Django Unchained's sensitive setting, but Django Unchained is really so funny. Those two jokers, Django and Dr. Schultz, have numerous humorous moments. Calvin Candie has handfuls of laughable lines. The completely comedic sequences with the KKK and the bags, is very amusing. Don Johnson plays a great Big Daddy and he's hilarious. I really crack up at Big Daddy in all his parts. \"You want I should treat him like white folks? No, that's not what I said.\" Jonah Hill is terrible during that scene. Jonah plays stupid really stupid-like.Django Unchained has incredible horse riding scenery, and a great kudos to the horses whom all did stellar jobs acting, not fully realizing that they were acting on film, all around strong performances.Django Unchained has a running time of 165 minutes, and it seems to fly by crazy fast. Chalk it up to drawn out, deeply captivating scene after scene, whereas, not one single second of Django is a bore. There is a scene I feel is considerably worse than any other in the movie. At a very crucial juncture, the oriental ode whilst setting the dinner table, with Hilde walking up the stairs to meet and greet King in his chambers, it was missing something, unless I missed something. I estimate Tarantino was going for an unconventional character presentation, nevertheless, it was ill-placed. In Django, Tarantino uses his credentials to taunt and tease the viewer as to what could possibly be next. The biggest gripe about Django Unchained, is this, the movie has its suave, elegant style for the first 2 and more hours that is leading up to one extraordinary ending, but it all gets scrapped, and the movie flips itself into a mindless, shoot-em-up action flick. That was really unappreciated, and is a major reason the movie didn't score higher.Django Unchained is awfully awesome. Just like Django is 1 in 10,000 exceptional, so is Quentin Tarantino. With the completion and release of Django Unchained, the question is beginning to beg to Tarantino. When, now, are you gonna stop playing around and make again that one serious movie, that Pulp Fiction serious movie?",

            "content": "What went wrong with one of the most inspiring and original directors of the 1990s? A man who used to produce some of the best films of their respective era is now reduced to endless vanity without much in the way for entry if you're not a movie nerd and/or an obsessive surrounding exploitation cinema. Django Unchained - his worst film since the atrocious Kill Bill saga - is the latest in this decline of quality, and it's about time to admit that Tarantino's talent is on the wane.The main problem is that the film is too damn long. Actually, scratch that - the problem is not that it's long, as many great movies are similar length here, including some of Tarantino's best. What is the important is not that it's long by itself, but that it's that length with a series of characters and story far too weak to justify its runtime. While similar generic revenge stories may be bad, they're not three hours long, nor are they widely overpraised due to the director involved, who only gets positive praise for his work nowadays due to the goodwill he earned in the 90s, and the declining standards in the meantime allowing for anything that is slightly different to be heavily overrated.And boy, are the characters thin. Generic video game characters have more complexity than this, and the rare moments of depth - Django being reluctant to initially kill for example - are never explored, to focus on more references, and 'oh isn't that Franco Nero, how quaint' moments that eat up the film to endless annoyance. On that, it helps to undermine the film as well; when the Brittle brothers are killed 40 minutes into the movie, there is no tension of satisfying payoff, as they weren't developed enough as villains to make me care or loathe them as an audience member. Like Inglorious Basterds, Tarantino expects the loathsome nature of the bad guys - them being slave holders - enough to make them hateful enough, instead of showing us so. But that's mistaken; not only are they heavily underdeveloped, but Tarantino never gives us a sense of how awful they actually are, making their deaths unsatisfying and uninteresting.The same goes for the death of Candie and the several action scenes, as there is no character development to speak of, we don't care about whether these characters live or die, making any attempts at tension or excitement fall flat on their face. In comparison to say Sam Peckinpah's best work - who Tarantino earns a lot of debt to, but lacks the talent to pull it off - there is no development to the villains to make them truly hateful. In Straw Dogs for instance, the crucial rape scene in that film makes the violent deaths of those involved worth it and exciting, because it has been earned by the film's end. There is nothing like that in Django Unchained, given its lack of focus or smarts there.And it isn't clearly who this movie is for, given that it happily insults every possible demographic imaginable. For white people, it insinuates through one line of dialogue that killing them is fine based on such characteristics. Southeners the film takes particular relish to, with them either being portrayed as evil or dumb, reflecting the Hollywood elite sneering attitude towards them, presumably because they're traditional in many ways. Black people too aren't spared; their hero is subservient to a white man throughout the majority of the film, and the rest are either offensive caricatures - especially Samuel L. Jackson's cringey role - or victim characters, and that's without going in to the films love of certain words, which are excessive. Australians also are sneered at, with Tarantino's lack of effort in doing a convincing accent. At least he gets blown up with dynamite by the end. A payback to the audience whose patience he was testing at that point.Meanwhile, there is little else to recommend the film. The action, as I've said, lack tension due to no character or plot development, and is just gory carnage with no payoff. Scenes go on and on forever, and often feel pointless (the high-larious Klan skit - just look at those dumb rednecks! Ha, ha! anyway, here's more uses of the n word, everybody!), making the film more ungodly dull than it previously was. The acting is good, but these people are given nothing to do at worst, and even at best, actors like Leonardo DiCaprio are great, but often chew the scenery and little more. The only reason the rating isn't lower is because it was well made enough to be impressive, and that the acting was good. It isn't something like The Room for instance, which lacks both, and is the best worst movie ever made from that, because it has an entertainment and passion factor this lacks. Tarantino is on autopilot, and is so painfully obvious to.But does it fix any of the problems Tarantino's films have had since Jackie Brown? Well yes one; the sadistic violence, which had consistently been a problem from the Kill Bill movies onwards is fixed slightly. It's still far too graphic and sleazy for it's own good, but there is some restraint to the more violent scenes, and they aren't allowed to go on for extended lengths of time, unlike his earlier films, which is good. But if that's the only thing he's ever so slightly fixed, with the other major problems remaining - weak characters, overlong, callbacks which don't help anything - than he's clearly not trying anymore.And that's the sense I get while watching this; Tarantino is no longer trying anymore. He knows he can put any old rubbish out there, and it'll still garner endless critical praise, box office receipts by the millions and awards by the bucketload, because of all of the goodwill he received from the 1990s. But goodwill is meant to be built on, not built besides to, and garbage like this is a testament to that.",

It's then that I stopped being fully engaged and it's where I became aware that I was watching just another fun, silly movie that was starting to get really top-heavy. Also, and this is kinda serious, Django the character was kinda.. BORING. This might have been the intention. For example, it could be that Django was mirroring one-dimensional gunslinger heroes of classic westerns, but when you hear these accompanying musical odes you can't help but to expect more. A bit more fleshed out character and even some added spice. I liked the fact that the original Django had a cameo, plus that there where these original songs written especially for the movie this time. Especially the song 'Ancora Cui' by Morricone.

            "content": "When a horse gets shot in the head in the first 5 minutes, this should instantaneously remind every audience member that they are watching writer/director Quentin Tarantino's latest revenge flick, \"Django Unchained\". But this isn't just a revenge story, it's also a moving love story as well. Starring Jamie Foxx as Django, a slave in the Deep South who is forcibly recruited by a German bounty hunter, Dr. Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz, who promises to give Django his freedom following the capture three Overseers turned outlaws. But when Schultz finds out that Django's true quest in life is to reunite with his long lost wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) as they had been separated by slave trade, he takes it upon himself to help Django on his journey; a journey which leads them to Candy Land, the plantation owned by one Calvin Candie, fabulously played by Leonardo DiCaprio in an award worthy performance.As in his other films, brilliantly constructed dialogue, shock value violence, with a mixture of campy satire and beautiful aesthetics fuel this story. But undoubtedly the most interesting aspect of \"Django Unchained\" is how ballsy of a subject matter this is, for a director who has (in the past) been accused of using the \"N\" word so flippantly. And as if Tarantino was very aware of this fact, not long into the film it becomes quite obvious that \"Django Unchained\" will not only stand as the newest film from the #1 film geek turned director himself, but also as a well formatted rebuttal (middle finger) to all of his \"haters\".This is truly the Tarantino Western in every facet, with great shoot-out sequences, wonderfully Clint Eastwood-esque dialogue and characters that are all larger than life. Hell, he even formats a satirical KKK comedy bit that is as funny as anything in Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles\". But it's not until this film hits the scenes within Candy Land in Act 2, does \"Django Unchained\" work as 100% entertainment (but this doesn't happen until about an hour in). That said, the first hour of this movie takes a while to develop (much like the old 60's westerns) Tarantino's refusal to outsource his score does tonally hinder the film a bit and the third act carries on about fifteen minutes longer than is necessary. So, while that doesn't change the fact that the second act of this movie (the central hour) is damn near perfect, it also means \"Django Unchained\" doesn't reach its full potential as an overall film; to the point where this may be seen as a slightly underdeveloped failure by some Tarantino fans expecting every one of his films to be \"Pulp Fiction\".The Acting: Aside from a cameo by Don Johnson playing a plantation owner named Big Daddy, which is clearly the cameo of the year, and both Waltz (who should only be in Tarantino films from now on) and Foxx doing fine enough work here, the real stars of the show are Samuel L. Jackson, who plays the hilariously evil old house slave (the Uncle Tom) in Candy Land and DiCaprio, who is the best part of this movie by far, giving his depiction of a flamboyantly evil Plantation owner. DiCaprio is astounding to watch here, not only chewing the scenery but eating it alive, giving a performance which is so despicably engaging, that it's sure to live on in cinematic villain history.Side Note: There should be no complaints about Tarantino's depictions of African American's in \"Django Unchained\" simply because while he does maintain his trademark pulpy violent, dark comedy style throughout, at many times he does push the boundaries, more than ever before, with a dramatic and fairly historically accurate portrayal of the South during slavery. In fact, the main thing that separates \"Django Unchained\" from his other films is this added dose of reality, which is sure to make audiences uncomfortable; and rightfully so, as this is a movie about slavery. Make no butts about it, some of this film is very hard to watch (in the same vein as something like \"Amistad\" would be). And while these serious visual choices that Tarantino makes may come off as tonally strong, it all works because of how historically necessary they are to the story. Another difference here is how this may be the first Tarantino film where audiences are made to feel an overwhelming sense of sorrow for the main character's plight. But also make note that Django is not depicted as a \"poor me\" black man (i.e. like the Michael Oher character in \"The Blindside\") but as the self empowered hero; a black character that is rarely seen in these types of films. So (in my opinion) \"Django Unchained\" not only pays homage to the 1966 Spaghetti Western \"Django\" (riddled with sudden zooms and extreme closes ups on squinting eyes) but also works as an homage to black history.Final Thought: While the story itself isn't as creative as \"Inglorious Basterds\" and it's not a movie Spike Lee will be watching any time soon, \"Django Unchained\" is clearly a better movie than anything Lee has put out in a long time and is definitely worth checking.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Containing a great story, terrific performances, good dialogue, and brilliant pacing, Django is Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction, and that is really saying something. The story of Django Unchained is that a black slave turned bounty hunter named Django is going after a plantation owner that has his wife. The story is told in a great way that only Tarantino can do, I can't explain it really, but the story is so fascinating I was always interested to see where it was going. It also uses its setting to great effect, along with great pacing that keeps moving at a fast pace, you will find this story's setting just as interesting as its colorful characters and gorgeous visuals, or the gripping balls-to-the-wall action scenes. With its all-star cast containing big names like Leonardo Dicaprio, Samuel L Jackson, Jamie Foxx, and many others you know that they are all going to pull off their roles perfectly. And boy do they ever, especially Leonardo Dicaprio who plays one of my favorite villains in recent memory, and Jamie Foxx is a natural fit for this character. Their dialogue is well written, but there is one problem with the dialogue and that is the constant usage of the n-word. While I understand that people back then used that word very often, I still could've done without them saying it every 30 seconds. However, that is a relatively small complaint. Django Unchained is a insanely entertaining western that I hold on par with Tarantino's best film: Pulp Fiction. It's brilliant mix of action, dialogue, setting, visuals, and storytelling ensures that this is one film that deserves all the praise it has been receiving. As for Spike Lee's stupid criticism: I didn't know who he was till he said what he said, and he looks like a moron for saying it. This film is pure awesome.",

After killing the men and several others after Django And Schultz become partners, they decide to go to Mississipi to save Django's slaved wife who is enslaved by a brutal plantation owner named by Calvin Candie, and they must work out how to save his wife from the sly Candie.The Acting by the cast as a whole was great, but the acting Trio of Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Di Caprio and last but not the least Christoph Waltz were the real show stealers and their acting was vital to this movie becoming so good. Jamie Foxx does a great job as the freed slave Django who turns into a bounty hunter and now must save his wife, and Foxx is a real capable actor and he does quite greatly in this. Di Caprio has done a terrific job as the sly and lethal Calvin Candie and he portrays the role of this villiain terrificly and his facial expressions and dialogue delivery were spot on. Although these two were amazing, Christoph Waltz in my opinion Knocks the ball out of the park in this movie as the Dentist/ Bounter Hunter Dr King Schultz who is the mentor and saviour of Django and trains him to become a Bounty Hunter, and Waltz and Tarantino are almost like a match made in heaven, they are flawless while working together and I truly hope Waltz gets some more awards for this. Samuel L. Jackson also does a very good job in his short role as Stephen, Caldie's assistant who is jealous of Django.Now We All Know that Quentin Tarantino has a knack of making violent movies and displaying his movie's mostly in the form of violence and blood and abusive things, but he is just soo perfect at making these kind of movies that you forget about these violence and just get stuck into this movie which is guaranteed to entertain you from the very first scene to the last. Tarantino has done a massive job in making a good as a western movie like this as this is his first of the type, and the action, art direction, cinematography, screenplay and acting are spot on along with the great sense of background music, and his direction is so good that everything is near flawless in this movie and he really deserves something after all his brilliant works.The Screenplay in this movie written by Tarantino himself is absolutely brilliant and the dialogues(although abusive at many times) are soo brilliant and brilliantly delivered by the acting cast, and as this is an original story, this really deserves an applauding for its uniqueness and sheer brilliance. The Background music is so brilliant and addictive that it really keeps you entertained from scene to scene and what music director has done brilliantly is that he has used all sorts of music to synchronise them with the scenes.The Cinematography in the movie is brilliant as the 1850's shown in the movie is quite perfect and the U.S.A area's shown in that movie is so original and so real that you actually feel as if you are in those times. The Cinematographer Robert Richardson deserves some applauds for his brilliant work in the movie. The Art Direction and Costume Design in the movie are also brilliant and it adds to making the story original and showing the time's perfectly!Well, This Movie is a real smashing movie and although it isn't certain to get many awards because of its violence, it truly deserves some big awards and Django Unchained will be certain to keep you entertained right from the first scene and it definitely is one of the best movies of 2012.My Rating: 9/10",

            "content": "I've been looking forward to this movie for a long, long time. I finally got to see it yesterday night, and I'm thrilled to say the movie didn't disappoint.The film opens with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) freeing Django (Jamie Foxx) from his abusive owners. They then make an agreement to track down three brothers, who were previous owners of Django, and kill them for a reward. Over the course of the film, the two characters bond, and eventually Schultz agrees to help Django rescue his lost wife, who is owned by a malicious plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Every character in the film is perfectly cast. Jamie Foxx does a nice job of carrying the film, and Samuel L. Jackson does very well with his role. In particular, Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio shine; I fully expect one of them to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.From the first scene, I was hooked. As masterful as ever, Tarantino combines witty dialogue with bloody violence to create an awesome cinematic experience. Everything is way over the top - fight sequences feature excessive gore, many scenes are drawn out for comedic effect, and the profanity is ubiquitous. The film clocks in at 165 minutes, almost three hours, and I never once was bored.One last thing that I really enjoyed is how the film looks; as far as I could tell, the CGI in this film was very minimal. After seeing The Hobbit last week, this movie was extremely fresh and organic in its appearance, and it really contributed to how enjoyable the film was.Overall, this is a great movie. Witty dialogue, wonderful acting, and brutal violence all combine to make a darkly funny movie. Definitely my favourite film of 2012.RATING: 9/10",

            "content": "This is my first Quentin film, and it is one of the most amazing and exhilarating experiences of my life. It is almost perfect in it's old fashioned execution and spaghetti western style filming. I realize that this film is being heavily criticized for it's extreme violence and heavy use of the \"N\" word. Firstly, the great thing about this movie is that the violence is being directed at the right people for the most part, the people who in fact deserve their gory fate. Slavery was a terrible chapter in America's history, and two movies this year have brilliantly condemned it, albeit in two entirely different ways, Lincoln being the other film. Here Django, the film's heroin, takes justice into his own hands and shows the world how slave owners really were in those days. and also how to deal with them not in the most legal way, but arguably in the most effective and unarguable th most entertaining way possible. In this film, no evil doer gets off Scot free. All of them meet their very satisfying end under tarentino's watch. That is why you must forgive this film for all of it's bloodshed, because the blood is shed from the people who undoubtedly deserve it. And as for the N word, honestly it's 1860, people said the N word quite a bit in those times people!! Historical fiction is always criticized for the inaccuracy of some old custom or other (i.e. gladiator, Spartacus...anything about Rome). Well here ya go!I suppose I now should talk about the exquisite performances in this film. First off, Jaime Fox is actually quite good as Django, it's just that his character suffers from the fact that he is quite two dimensional, and he really only has one true goal: to get his wife back while killing as many white people as he can along the way. We now move over the man of the hour, Christoph Waltz. This is the first movie I have seen him in, and he blew me away with his wonderful comedic timing, the ruthlessness combined with the sympathy for django, and his underwhelming charm that kept the movie going. The best scenes in the movie contained him, (minus the final scene, which was just wonderfully executed.) in his deserved Oscar winning performance. Leo DiCaprio is also superb as the sadistic plantation owner Calvin Candie, and was very unlucky y not to get an Oscar nom. His flair and love for life being one of the most evil men in cinema history just added to the experience, and also showed quite clearly how terrible the world was back then. Samuel L. Jackson steals every scene he's in as Calvin's head slave and partner in crime Stephen. He represents what Django must fight against and destroy: a world where slavery has become such an everyday enterprise that blacks suck up to the whites and turn against their own people instead of fighting against the injustice. He's someone you absolutely love to hate, but your glad that he dies in the final scene so that you get to enjoy every minute with him. I could go on and on but i'll just say this to you now: if you like movies that really make you feel good at the end, see this! You could not ask for a better end to such wonderfully evil people.",

Tarantino gives us this simple plot and lets his characters run loose.Speaking about characters, what an AMAZING cast.

While Django Unchained is not as good as Pulp Fiction, and it is much more violent as well, it also raises some very disturbing questions about the history of slavery.Most importantly, from an artistic point of view, Tarantino has managed to create a peculiarly Tarantino Western genre film in an unexpected context. Yes, the \u00a8good\u00a8 protagonists are all vaguely repugnant, but they are true antiheroes in the Western genre film tradition. Tarantino knew what he was doing when he put this piece together. Still too violent for my tastes, and much of it gratuitously horrific, but I cannot fault Tarantino for being Tarantino. That is who he is!",

The character's fate at the end of the movie was touching but in a somewhat comedic manner. I like that while the movie takes place in a very discrimination-filled period of history against the blacks it's still filled with comedic moments here and there to lighten the mood making the experience of watching it more pleasurable and not as angry and whatnot at the racism of the black characters and how they're being treated.

            "content": "One of the things that I love about the films of Quentin Tarantino is the clear love of cinema that permeates all of his movies. Tarantino at his best (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, parts of Kill Bill 1 and 2) can remind you how exhilarating cinema can be. In his less successful works (parts of Kill Bill 1 and 2, the parts of Inglourious Basterds featuring the 'Basterds') his inability to resist allusions to other works or to resist characters that 'strike a pose' can lead the films to cross the line into pastiche. Although he's still guilty of these weaknesses in Django Unchained, they don't prevent it from being one of his best films and one that despite its faults, and there are few, maintains the viewers interest for most its near three hour length. A remake of a 1966 Spaghetti Western Jamie Foxx plays the title character, a slave taken on by bounty hunter King Schultz (Christophe Waltz) in order to help find his former overseers. Once free Django joins Schultz in a professional capacity and is Django is able to embark on a more personal search. Jamie Foxx gives a fine performance but ends up overshadowed first by the sheer charm displayed by Waltz and then the showier and unsettling, but highly effective, turns of both DiCaprio and Jackson (as slave owner Calvin Candie and his head slave, Stephen respectively). Tarantino, while usually having primarily male casts, writes strong roles for women so it's perhaps a little surprising that the stunning Washington (as the wife of Django) has relatively little to do. Most of the remaining cast is roll call of cameos from icons of 80's TV and film along with an appearance from the original Django (Franco Nero) as well as slightly more bazaar appearances by Quentin Tarantino and Jonah Hill. This film will not be for everyone. Western purists may find some of the dialogue a little incongruous (to be fair, I'm not an historian and it's entirely possible that 'mother******' was widely used in the 1850's Old West) and the manufacturers of fake blood may go the wall if Tarantino ever stops directing. For those who like the film, 'Enjoyable' is perhaps still the wrong word for this movie. The film has come in for criticism for its depiction of slaves, and the brutalities visited on them, but since the horrors on display are apparently historically accurate it could be considered more offensive to gloss over these events in favour of a more palatable viewing experience. For a director almost exclusively associated with urban landscapes Django Unchained is without doubt Tarantino's most visually beautiful film and it's well chosen soundtrack only re-enforces this. As with previous films, Tarantino has largely eschewed original music in favour of music used in previous films along with well chosen contemporary music that despite its apparent incongruity provides an arresting background to the events on display. Tarantino has always had the ability unearth songs that have gone a little out of vogue and, in this case, Jim Croce's 'I Got a Name' is particularly effectively used (and sent this viewer to straight onto Youtube to find out more about the song). I'm not sure that Tarantino has managed a completely successful film since Pulp Fiction, but Django Unchained is the closest that he has come to that achievement since then.",

There are no good guys, just bad guys - the villains being pure evil with no redeeming human qualities; the protagonists are just as bad as the bad guys but parade under the justification that the villains are worse than they are so the violence is justified.The villains are one-dimensional at best (white slave owners that torture their slaves), and at worst simply names and faces to set up and knock down.",

            "content": "This has long been a difficult film for me to assess, much less form a coherent review over. On one hand it's a hilarious homage to 1970's Blaxploitation Westerns (namely the first three of Fred Williamson's career) and movies covering slavery (think DRUM and MANDINGO rather than ROOTS), all filtered through Tarantino's sensibilities with lots and lots of movie references and fun roles written for his friends. The casting of his films works a lot like the casting of Rob Zombie movies with lots of fun little cameos that also serve to distract. Jaime Fox, on the whole, performs his character with a lot of pathos and charisma (and I'm glad they ended up casting him over Will Smith), but I think his portrayal has a lot to do with why I can't quite love this movie and think it needed another actor.I think I would have liked this movie a lot more had Django been written as a more likeable of a character. As it, he's just this ultimate warrior with an excellent aim and learning abilities right out of the gate. It would have been a lot more interesting to see him grow and make some mistakes along the way, but I feel that Tarantino simply didn't really have the courage to do so.Yes, Tarantino is normally a very courageous writer and knows how to play with conventions and give us villains we love. Here, since he's handling extremely sensitive subject matter, he unfortunately pulls back by turning the protagonist into such a flawless white knight, in the figurative sense. He compensates by amping up the violence considerably over his past films, but these days that doesn't really mean much. The real hero of the film would be Chrisoph Waltz who carries everything on his shoulders.The movie stumbles, though, with Waltz's overly elaborate plan to save Django's wife and some of the strange decisions the characters have to make in order for the plot to flow from there. It ends up delivering an action packed fourth act, but this all happens way too late in the movie and, narratively, didn't really need to be there at all.If you ask me, the narrative thrust falls off around the Regulator attack, about 45 minutes into the movie, leaving the movie to meander trying to find what it's going to be about. Is it going to be about forming a career, saving a woman, or getting revenge? If it was going to do all three, wouldn't it have been better to co-mingle the missions rather than hit each one so linearly?All in all a great-looking and well-acted movie. Samuel L. Jackson particularly shines as the real villain of the film in a very surprising part for him, but it speaks to his strength as an actor. He's largely why I'd label this as one of Tarantino's most rewatchable and interesting films, but also his most frustrating.",

(Uma Thurman drawing a square and saying don't be a square, douche.) Funny enough this had the same affect, brilliant start, good credit sequence and a good start Django and Dr Schultz in the bar scene. Alas it goes downhill from there.The acting was alright for what they had to work with. Christopher Waltz was great but as a character became more of a novelty with no development. Interesting to see Samuel Jackson do something different but his character had no facets really. Never been a big fan of his work only really liking him funny enough in Pulp Fiction oh and Die Hard with a Vengeance. Jamie Foxx had this weird arc of one second being a slave and with no transition becomes a gunslinger.I love the Franco Nero Django, one of my nephews couldn't wait to see this remembering me showing them the flick with the cowboy who carries around a coffin. The only relation this film has to Spaghetti Westerns is the poster.I have read stuff about this being really violent and gory it even being more violent than Scarface. What? It was comic violence with no visceral intensity which for me doesn't count as violence, more cheap really.All the controversy about the use of the N word (IMDB won't let me write the word even though it is integral to the movie.) and its portrayal of slavery. Who cares? It's a piece of trash written by a middle class, white, male westerner who has no intention of informing. He just wants to do what he thinks is cool and set the standard. I agree with him when he says if he was to portray the real brutality of slavery it would be unwatchable and also slavery is actually more complicated than bullshit skin color. If you are going to see a Tarantino piece of trash for a history lesson then that says a lot about you.I am sorry but I am sick of being disappointed by this dope and angry at myself for always getting sucked in because of the unbelievably brilliant Reservoir Dogs.I had to give this 2 out of 10 because there are flicks I can't sit through like Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland and I did sit through this.Tarantino is as an overrated US export as Big Macs and The free market.",

            "content": "In Texas, 1858, a dentist turned bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is seeking the whereabouts of a gang known as the Brittle Brothers. To find them he frees Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who knows who the men are. Travelling across the South together, the two men form a partnership, with Schultz teaching the former slave the skills of a bounty hunter. In exchange for hunting the Brittle Brothers, Schultz agrees to help locate and free Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is still in captivity. She is a servant to a powerful slave trader, the courteous but untrustworthy Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). He runs a plantation called Candie Land, where slaves are encouraged to fight each other. Django and Schultz must pretend to be interested in buying a slave-fighter so that they can also bargain for Broomhilda's freedom. One of Candie's loyal slaves Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) remains suspicious of their new guests. Django Unchained is the film where Quentin Tarantino finally grew up. The former video store clerk turned director, fifty next year, is showing signs he's ready to put his film geek senses aside and start substantiating his work. Django surprises because Tarantino has pared back the pop references, the verboseness and the juvenility that marks much of his work. The man who once said \"violence is one of the most fun things to watch\" now has something important to say about the way that killers and violence are manufactured. If this isn't shocking enough, the film is also his most compassionate and romantic work since Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004), with characters who finally have something internal resembling genuine feelings.Having imitated a number of popular film genres, Tarantino has longed to make a proper Western, a tribute to his hero Sergio Leone. He once named The Good the Bad and the Ugly (1966) as his favourite film and like that movie, or any great Western, there is a wealth of commentary on justified violence here. However, the strength of Django is that it doesn't merely mimic Leone's work but provides new insights into the way that murder was deemed a necessity in the American West and the price of human life. Tarantino uses comedy to address this troubling subject matter, transcending its absurdity and brutality in unique ways we have not seen before. Schultz's introduction is fantastic. He is richly characterised, not as a cold blooded psychopath, but as a businessman. After shooting a slave owner off his horse, Schultz puts down his rifle and then asks if he can have a bill of sale for Django. Later he explains: \"I kill people and sell corpses for cash\". Every kill to him is a business deal. He only kills people if he has the right paperwork for the bounty and believes he is acting within the confines of the law. Christoph Waltz is perfect in this role. He strips away any hint of malice and replaces it with a hilarious amount of gentility that makes him seem almost naive to the seriousness of his actions. Interestingly, this character also shows changes that make him seem like a rounded human being; something unique to any Tarantino film. Schultz's friendship with Django makes him feel more responsible for other people, not just for freeing this one slave, but seeing how other people kill for entertainment, including a vicious dog attack on a slave. Django, quietly expressive by a great Jamie Foxx performance, also faces powerful moral questions about the value of life and race. Brief intercuts to memories of his wife increase the film's romantic temperament but later test his moral grounds. To fool Candie, Django must act like a slave trader and be neglectful of slaves himself. Both protagonists are therefore asked how much they're willing to sell themselves morally for flesh - a complex allegory for slavery itself.The Candie Land scenes reach tension levels on par with Inglourious Basterds (2009). Infrequent close-up shots on Django's face and on his revolver are hugely suspenseful touches. Both DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson also form a pair of scene stealing baddies of frightening unpredictability, and build a chilling mirror to Schultz and Django's own friendship. There is an artifice to their civility, reflected through the art direction and mise en sc\u00e8ne. The rooms of the main house are handsomely lit by candlelight and furnished with leather fittings. A woman plays Beethoven on a harp and we watch the slaves set out placements on the main dining table. But the unspoken psychological dilemma remains: do all of these luxuries come at the expense of a pound of flesh? This question is visualised with perhaps the most dramatic Faustian-like handshake in the history of movies.For all the depth of the screenplay and the amazing performances, there are niggling shortcomings. Some technical issues include Tarantino's overly playful editing cuts and an anachronistic soundtrack, using songs from the likes of Tupac. The last fifteen minutes are also disastrous. The old Tarantino emerges with silly shootouts and an extremely stupid, unfunny cameo, a supposed gift to Australia. God help us. These are distractions from a very mature theme: no matter what their skin colour, all killers become indistinguishable from one another. Nonetheless, discussing an imperfect Tarantino film is still better than saying nothing at all.",

            "review_title": "Fiercely entertaining Spaghetti Western homage from Tarantino",
            "content": "Quentin Tarantino has become one of America's most innovative filmmakers in that he takes his unapologetic love of movies, B movies in particular, and crafts original films out of bits and pieces that pay homage to the movies he loves. No more obvious then his latest ode to the Spaghetti Western, Django Unchained. This epic story of ex-slave turned bounty hunter, Django (Jaime Foxx) has it's main character named after the lone gunslinger played by Franco Nero in Sergio Corbucci's classic Spaghetti Western of the same name. And in case you didn't get that point, not only does the film open with that 1966 film's theme song but, sports a delightful cameo from Franco Nero himself. The story opens with a slave, Django being bought in a humorously violent scene by German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz ( Christoph Waltz). Schultz promises Django his freedom if the slave will help him track down three wanted men Django has seen but, Schultz has not. But, Django has quite a knack for bounty hunting and after their quarry is gunned down, in a great scene involving a hilariously sleazy Don Johnson as a racist plantation owner, the two team up. But, when Schultz hears of the plight of Django's German speaking slave wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), he agrees to help him search for and free her. This brings them to the door of a vile plantation owner, who specializes in slave fights, named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Will Django and Schultz be able to rescue his wife from the devious and well armed Candie? A lot of bullets and blood fly before that question gets answered. Django Unchained isn't perfect. It is definitely a bit too long and the last act could have structured a bit more efficiently but, Tarantino has always been a bit over indulgent and we let him slide because of all the things he gets right\u0085 and because his films are usually so damn entertaining. And one of the things he gets so right here is the performances out of his cast. Jaime Fox is impressive as Django bringing both a sly humor and a smoldering strength to the slave turned bounty killer. I'm not usually a fan but, he won me over here. Christoph Waltz is an absolute delight as the German bounty hunter with a heart and sense of honor. He gives Tarantino's crisp and witty dialog vivid life and creates an instantly classic character from the pages of the director's script. The same could be said of the phenomenal performance by Leonardo DiCaprio whose wonderfully over the top Calvin Candie practically steals the show. DiCaprio is having a blast playing the vicious and sleazy dandy plantation owner whose charm oozes out of every pore but, only to cover up that this snake has fangs filled with venom and he will strike first chance he gets. And if that triple threat isn't enough, we have a side splitting performance by the great Samuel L. Jackson as Candie's cantankerous head slave Stephen. Stephen may be a slave but, sometimes his manipulation of Calvin makes you seriously wonder who is really running the Candie Land plantation. Tarantino once again gives this top notch cast some wonderful Tarantino dialog to work with and, as usual, shoots Django with his trademark luscious camera work. QT's love of film fills every frame. He skillfully mixes controversial topics such as the horrors of slavery and racism with some very sly and funny humor and peppers it with some blood spattering action and violence. Basically it's a Quentin Tarantino movie. And that's exactly what we paid to see. A fiercely entertaining movie with a great supporting cast featuring the likes of Jonah Hill, Bruce Dern, Don Stroud, Russ and Amber Tamblyn, Dennis Christopher, Michael Parks and James Remar to name a few.",

            "review_title": "Instant cult film",
            "content": "So, Tarantino decided to make a western movie, as he is a big fan of them. Not only that he decided to make one, he decided to make a very good one with a relatively typical spaghetti western story but, to put it mildly, not typical characters and locations. So Django Unchained takes place at the South of the USA (so-called Deep South) a few years before the Civil War and the main protagonists are German bounty hunter and a black slave who quickly becomes a black cowboy. A former dentist, now a headhunter, Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) decides to buy a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) to help him in finding three brothers for whom an arrest warrant has been issued. Thing is that Schultz does not know how they look while Django do. If he successfully complete the task Django is promised to get his freedom but Schultz was thrilled with Django as a headhunter so he offered him a partnership and help in saving his wife from cruel slaver Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).Django Unchained is more or less what the majority of the audience expected. While it is legitimate to criticize Tarantinos stylistic and filming constant throughout his career the fact is that he creates high-quality films that meets with mostly positive response among the audience. Also stylistic and filming repetitiveness is belaud characteristic of many other acclaimed filmmakers (the Coen brothers, Carpetner...) so there is no reason to be harsh with Tarantino for that. Django Unchained is primarily entertainment, then a brutal display of the first half of the 19th century in USA, and ultimately the criticism of human morality. Often mentioned violence is pervasive and somewhat glorified, but no more than in average action film.Acting is on extremely high level, which was also directly contributed by writing the script for specific actors. Thus, for instance, Dr. Schultz, Candie and Stephen were written directly for Waltz, DiCaprio and Jackson, while Django was written with Will Smith in mind. Jamie Foxx is definitely the weakest among main cast, although far from being bad his acting is definitely forgetful while previously enumerated trio is far away from being forgetful. Christoph Waltz is simply brilliant in the role of Dr. Schultz, which deviates slightly from Hans Landa and although many will find problem of repetitiveness in that, that should be ignored due to the success of the character and Waltzs performance. DiCaprio is excellent in his first role as a villain. He was so into it that when he really accidentally hit a glass with his fist and despite sizable bleeding never went out of the character. Samuel L. Jackson is also excellent in the role peevish old man with plenty of swearing and yelling. It looks like Tarantino wanted to have as much people as it was possible to participate in this movie, so we have a bunch of supporting characters, most of which was a cameo or almost a cameo role and most of them end up serving as cannon fodder. Even Franco Nero, the original Django, appears in the film and there were written roles for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Sacha Baron Cohen and Michael Kenneth Williams which were ultimately thrown out of the film as the trio couldn't participate in project. The dialogues are wonderfully worked out, with many lines that will become cult. The disadvantage is the unnecessarily lengthiness of the film itself and many completely unnecessary scenes. Some of these unnecessary scenes that serve the purpose of comedy like the one with hoods are not the problem, but the vast majority of others are, specially in the last half of hour. Editing is also obvious worse than in previous Tarantino films which were edited by, now late, Sally Menke. Soundtrack is particularly interesting. Giuseppe Verdi, Ennio Morricone and James Brown/2Pac duet (which unlike Rick Ross is interesting musical experiment) as a music background in few almost connected scenes is really special experience.Tarantino continues as usual, and while some will be happy with it, others will not, but the fact is that Django Unchained is instant cult film which in addition is well made and which characters will be quoted and scenes will be endlessly viewed.",

I found it extremely clever and funny throughout. Indeed, it seems to be as much an homage to Blazing Saddles and Skin Game as to the original Django. I had my usual language objections (mild by Tarantino standards), but not the one that seemed to bother everyone else.

Django Unchained is no exception and ranks right up there with the likes of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Death Proof, Jackie Brown and few others I liked.This is slavery from the Tarantino perspective and, oooooohyes.....it works....It is bloody and witty and fun and well-written complete with the (requisite/necessary?) element of unabashed revenge against the whole institution of slavery, which I, an African-American viewer, had absolutely no problem with. The film is filled with eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeex performances, i.e. Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Michael Parks and Christopher Waltz. As a matter of fact the only question I have is not with the film itself but with the supporting Oscar win for Waltz. While his performance was measured, wonderful, and his characterization as a whole was most positive, hands down the most sparkling performances were those of Di Caprio and Jackson. Their scenes together were simply stunning. And of course, every time Jackson opened his mouth, I lost it. These two deeeeeefinitely need to do another project - off the HOOK!!

Because, I've learned to appreciate the work Tarantino has put into making this movie. So,I went into this movie not expecting much. i was expecting it to be a movie that's all about blowing people up but its not even close to that! this film takes itself very seriously! Even though there is a lot of blood, brains, and guts in this movie it is still out of this world! everything and every performance in this movie was so well don i just can't put into words how good i thought some of the actors did. There is a lot of N-words and F-words and S-words and D-words and blood and over the top violence. But surprisingly it is still a phenomenal masterpiece! First off there is an amazing soundtrack with explicit songs but the music really gets you into the mood of the film. The Candie land shootout is one of (actually the best) Shootouts I've ever seen in my life! i would so highly recommend watching this movie. But most kids should not see it due to the explicit elements i mentioned earlier on in the review. This film also has some of the best money shots I've ever seen and also some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in my entire life! 14+ is my recommendation although it is rated R/18A.",

Sure, there are some question marks, but none that can't be straightened out with a bit of good will and imagination. And i know there's some critics out there who think that only \"art pieces\" deserve to be called \"well composed\", but i don't agree. A movie that actually does entertain and gives you value for both time and money in the best possible way should also deserve it. And this is it, here you have that movie.And as usual when it comes to Quentin Tarantino, all characters are as strongly represented as they can possibly be. And, without spoiling anything, i can guarantee you that you will be spoiled with one of the most intense gunfights ever seen in a movie. I would even go as far as to say that it equals the fight in \"Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid\". There's just \"a tiny bit\" more blood, but anyone who knows Tarantino knows that there will be a lot of blood and killing.I also have to praise some of the actors a bit more than the others, and of course there are to be praise poured over Jamie Fox for even being able to play the role in what manner he did. Had i been in his seat, i am not sure if i would have been able to withstand to play such a role. And as usual, Leonardo DiCaprio makes an exceptional role as the bad guy. I would not want to meet that man angry in a dark alley in the middle of the night. Not even a little grumpy, anywhere, in the middle of the day. But most of all, and I'm sure most of you would agree, Samuel L. Jackson excels, and goes far beyond what any one can expect. That man is magic, and even though i can't remember 2 movies with him in them that i haven't liked, this one put the right man in the right place. Giving him the right space to perform and give us a peek of how twisted and intriguing his mind can be when he gets his chases.All in all this was probably the best ever film i have seen from Tarantino, and i definitely recommend it to anyone, except those who know they cant take blood and gore and gruesome, realistic violence.",

Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained literally borrows its name from the 1960s cult Django westerns starring Franco Nero but bares no relation to the original movie apart from a short but really cool appearance from Franco Nero with the ultimate cheesy lines: \"What's the name?\" and \"American Django\". This time around, Quentin goes the extra mile and decides to be totally insensitive, audaciously bold and ridiculously funny by turning the horrors of black slavery holocaust into a heroic comic book. Only this time, its all about exacting revenge and experiencing the true satisfaction of retribution, which I am ashamed to say but I thoroughly enjoyed it. While some may find it racist and totally offensive, others may think it makes certain folks look like monsters and an unjust reason to carry out an act of terror and violence against slave plantation owners of the pre-civil war in America.

While a brilliant writer and talented visual stylist, his films (that I've seen) are indulgent and style over substance. While Reservoir Dogs was fantastic, Pulp Fiction went on and on, and this goes on even longer. This has been critically acclaimed even though it's style over substance, which is what critics moan about in a very tiresome manner. Django Unchained follows a German bounty hunter and a freed slave hunting for the slave's captured wife to free her and taking out various other villains along the way. Explosive, daring and typically subversive, DU bleeds ultra kinetic, hyper violent style from the very beginning and even through the many slow talking scenes there's always plenty of energy crackling beneath the surface. The cast does a great job overall. Samuel L Jackson, although not particularly recognisable, steals the show, with Leonardo DiCaprio giving a wonderful hateful performance and Christoph Waltz providing plenty of charisma and emotion in another fine performance, although perhaps not quite Oscar deserving, but still excellent. Jamie Foxx isn't particularly interesting or memorable as his character is less well developed but he works well with what he's given.The script is typically strong. There aren't any movies to reference as it's set in the 1800s, so the script isn't quite as much fun but it has a lot of swagger. Visually, it's a good film and Tarantino is still a fine visual stylist. The problem is DU's overlength. It's just too darn long! 2 hours and 40 minutes. That's how much Tarantino is in love with his dialogue, so much of it is filled with endless talking. Um Tarantino this isn't a talk show. This is a movie where you tell a story. Unfortunately, the story isn't told quickly enough and I eventually started to lose interest. The final fight scenes are extraordinary and stylish, but at the 2 hour mark Waltz randomly shoots DiCaprio and the film becomes an excuse to kill everyone. While this bit is still good, it does somewhat lose the ability to have its slavery themes taken seriously. DU is an indulgent, sometimes empty movie with plenty of positives and many good bits, but often the film dips between them. The second half of the movie just loses momentum, and when the over the top violence comes along it's almost a relief as something else is finally happening. Don't get me wrong though, it's a good film. Still, it needs a trim.6/10",

They became separated from each other on a slave auction following an unsuccessful attempt by the two to flee from their former owners. Schultz surprisingly exposes some kind of conscience and feels morally obliged to help Django free his wife, and as spring comes they set out to free her. Since she is only worth 300 dollars on the market, it would seem like a good plan to buy her free from her owner as long as the owner could be found, but the couple lay a much more complicated, expensive and blood-splattering plan. The plan involves something called \"mandingo\" fighters (tradable on the market of course), which gives Tarantino an opportunity to create more blood splattering and bone crushing action scenes.At this point the film has already become quite boring and it has lasted for a couple of hours already. You have to stay seated for almost one more hour if you want to see the end.The end eventually comes after one more hour of blood-splattering, I haven't seen more blood in a movie since 1980 (the flooding of the spooky corridors of Overlook Hotel). At that point, Django has freed his wife and killed every white man or woman in sight, and Django and his wife ride happily away, celebrating their revenge and freedom.Plus for film music and visual qualities, but the rest is really just crap. Tarantino's worst hitherto.",

            "review_title": "Tarantino's Worst Picture to Date (As of November 2017)",
            "content": "When \"Django Unchained\" first came out in 2012, it was instantly hailed as Tarantino's magnum opus and as one of the most thought-provoking and brutally honest films about slavery in recent memory. It won 2 Academy Awards and made a whopping 425mil at the worldwide box office. Suffice to say, I saw this film back when it first came out and thought it was terrible. I re-watched it the other day on TV and thought it was just as bad if not worse, than when I first saw it in 2012. This is easily Tarantino's worst movie (yes, even worse than the abysmal Death Proof) and provides absolutely ZERO insight into the horrors of American slavery. I found absolutely nothing of value in this picture and couldn't grasp how it was heralded as such a masterpiece by virtually everyone and their mother. I especially can't comprehend how ANYONE in their right mind can consider this joke of a movie to be saying anything worthwhile about slavery or even the times in which slavery was common practice. There was no message, no point, no realism of any kind, no authentic human emotion, nothing at all. The only real \"message\" that Tarantino tries to deliver (if anything) is that black people have the right to kill all white people because of slavery and stuff. Yep. This is some pretty revolutionary thinking right here. Give this man an Oscar, oh wait.Aside from the completely cartoonish and irresponsible take on a real period in history, my other issues with the film are as follows:Plot/Characters. There was very little plot to \"Django Unchained\" and what plot there is, was nothing special. In fact, the story was so linear and straight-forward that it was insulting. The entire first hour of the movie is boring exposition with very little if any, character (or plot) development. Django barely speaks. He doesn't emote whatsoever. He magically develops the ability of an expert marksman practically overnight. He doesn't behave like a slave (former or otherwise) in any way, shape or form. Dr. Schultz is equally bland in that he's annoying and smug. Never develops from there and he's not even interesting to begin with. To add insult to injury, he and Django have absolutely no chemistry. Yet, these two characters make up the ENTIRE first hour of this movie. It is mind numbingly dull in every which way. Only when we get to the introduction of Calvin Candie, played by Leo DiCaprio, does the movie actually become slightly more interesting. Despite playing a one-note and thoroughly unoriginal bad guy, DiCaprio manages to bring a new level of intrigue to his character which makes the movie semi-watchable. All the scenes with DiCaprio are the best of the movie and that is only because of DiCaprio's great acting chops, not Tarantino's writing or direction. But when DiCaprio is killed off at the 2hr. mark, the movie goes off the deep end and fast. It's like the first hour all over again except more blood and no Christoph Waltz. We get nonsensical character decisions like shipping off Django to some random Aussie miners instead of torturing and killing him like any sane person would, pointless blood baths in mansion with terrible and unfitting rap music, random white guys getting gunned down left and right, Tarantino's pathetic cameo, more random white guys getting shot out of nowhere and in the testicles, and a very stupid ending that could only be dreamt up in the head of a five year old. Django became the only remaining major character for the last 40mins of the movie and yet he was the weakest and least interesting character out of all (even Samuel L. Jackson's character was more interesting and that's saying A LOT). Thus, the first and third hour of this movie is atrocious. The middle section with DiCaprio is only kind of watchable because he is such a good actor. With no discernible plot, no interesting characters to speak of, bad music choices, boring narrative structure, overlong and useless scenes (like KKK scene), complete lack of realism, awful ending, zero insight into slavery, and pitiful Tarantino Aussie cameo, I am truly at a loss as to where all the accolades and praise come from in regards to this \"movie\". Even The Hateful Eight was better than this tripe and that made less than half of what Django did. Oh, I forgot to mention how annoyingly often the \"n word\" (can't say the full word on this site) is thrown around in this movie. It clearly was not meant to portray \"realism\" as there is none of any kind in this movie. Which means, QT is behaving like a child who uses bad words all the time simply because he can. Between this movie and The Hateful Eight, he really needs to stop embarrassing himself.",

            "content": "Watched this movie on 6/16 not really knowing what to expect. All of my friends who saw it in theaters raved about how \"crazy\" and \"awesome\" Django Unchained had been. I for one viewed the movie as the title of my review describes; racist, raunchy, and radical! There are a slough of things I could get into about this movie but I will keep it short. I had heard through the vine that while being very comedic, this movie had a very Western atmosphere and was realistic in its interpretation of Slavery during the 1860's. That being said with Django's comedic and black righteous overtones, wrapped into a Western Movie, I was very satisfied with this movie. Characters: In terms of bounty hunting Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz couldn't have done a better job. Dr. Schultz sporadic personality combined with Django's hatred for Candie made for a kick-ass duo. Upon the introduction of Candie, I couldn't have hated him more, which made his death all the more satisfying. Leonardo DiCaprio takes on a likeness I've never seen in him as Calvin Candie, the ruthless black-hearted owner of the Candyland Plantation. From the tone of his voice, to the torture he put Django's wife through, everything in between made his death all the more righteous in the grand scheme of the movie. A few other points of interest to me were some of the special effects. During scenes in which people died (there are a lot) I found the amount of blood spilled to be a bit unrealistic. Especially when Django has a shootout in the big house. The amount of blood spilled wasn't a gross out factor, it was somewhat comical. My friends looked at me funny when I started laughing during that scene. A final thing that kind of turned me off to Django a little bit was the use of the n word. I mean it isn't a big deal, but I got kind of tired of hearing it five times every scene. SO, over all I gave Django a 7 out of 10. Seven points awarded for the fact that it was a near perfect blend of comedy,action, and historical fiction, and three points taken off for overuse of certain special effects, and the N word, but hey, other than that, pretty good flick for those who aren't afraid of a little blood and a few heavy words.",

            "content": "With western influences seeping into so many Quentin Tarantino films (such as Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds), an actual western film by Tarantino is a dream come true. Styles and sensibilities align in a sublime manner, resulting in what must be one of the most unique and refreshingly entertaining films in the genre.Django Unchained has everything that makes a Tarantino so great: style, sharp dialogue, an attentive production, poignant violence, unpredictable plotting, and vengeful characters we can root for. The film has several major shooutouts and duels, which are quite thrilling, and extremely bloody. The violence here is on the same level as a Paul Verhoeven film, for it is explosively bloody and pulpy, and it never shies away from showing the painful consequences of such violence. There are also a few brutal scenes that can be pretty hard to watch. When the bullets aren't flying, however, the film maintains a lot of interest with its purposeful dialogue and pacing, and with its plot building. I feel the film slowed down and lost some of its vibe quite a bit in the middle, but most everything else is fantastically entertaining.The plot is what makes the film work, more than the action. It's somewhat divided into several episodes of sorts, but they all build up a central revenge-driven conflict, and it all reaches a satisfying climax. The plot twists and turns in very wild and interesting directions, and always with vigilant attention to the characters. Django himself is a character we can't help but to root for, while Dr. Schultz is a character too interesting to dismiss. Most everybody else are bad guys we love to hate. Beneath nearly every scene is a poignant undercurrent of racism, a theme which drives all of the characters and the story. Do be warned that such themes have not sat well with many audience members, especially with the film's language.As expected, this film has a ton of style. You can certainly expect quality photography and sharp editing. Acting is very good: Jamie Foxx does his best to make the title character iconic, while Christoph Waltz and Leo DiCaprio both liven things up a lot and try to steal each scene. Samuel L. Jackson is as grumpy as ever, and it was a joy to watch Kerry Washington. Writing is superb; Tarantino continues to show incredible skill as wielding dialogue and language of given eras and cultures for entertaining effect. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, but I did feel that a few things looked a little too modern or out-of-place in a western. As with most of his other films, Tarantino manipulates music in the film impeccably.The violence and racist issues have caused some controversy, but Django Unchained is a brilliant marriage of Tarantino's beloved style and Tarantino's beloved genre. Westerns aren't even my thing, but D.U. is exciting enough and has enough style and substance to make me call it a favorite.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",

            "content": "This is one of the best movies I have watched in a long time. It is a pure Tarantino blast. The somewhat unexpected and quite hilarious start of the movie catches your attention from the start and from then on it is 3 hours (almost) of pure enjoyment.The main actors are playing their roles very well. The Dr. King Schultz character (Christop Walz) is incredibly funny without being ridiculous, Jamie Foxx is excellent as Django and Leonardo DiCaprio is doing his role well as a plantation owner and slave trader. None of the rest of the crew stood out as particularly bad. Well with the possible exception of Tarantino himself then when he made his usual in-movie appearance a' la Hitchcock. Not that he was particularly bad but he is no actor either.The movie starts of by Dr. Schulz liberating Django and proceeding to a small town showing Django what he is in the business of doing. Those first minutes of the movie are somewhat unexpected and very funny to watch. After that the movie gets more serious as Django gets to learn to be a bounty hunter and finally gets on with his quest to rescue his \"Damsel in distress\". It still has quite a bit of \"Tarantino humour\" sprinkled around in it though.During the movie we are treated to a long series of stereotypical people with, let us say, an \"attitude\" towards African people. It is tempting to say \"nigger haters\" but that would not be true since a lot of these people did not exactly hate them. They just did not consider African people to be people but more than live stock for them to use as they wished. Unlike a lot of movies portraying these events this one never comes across as boringly finger pointing or overly morally lecturing. Nor does it in any way support or glorify the way things were at this time. It is a movie made to entertain set in a period where bad sh-t happened and using it for the story. Nothing more and nothing less.As usual with a Tarantino movie there are some violent parts, some more violent parts and some bloody violent parts in it. The ending fights are a glorious show of destruction and blood splatter. I am sure some people are complaining about the \"unnecessary violence\". I am not one of those people. Without these parts it would not be a real Tarantino movie. As always it is made with the usual exaggeration that Tarantino is so good and which reminds you that it is \"only a movie\".This is one of the few movies that I have given 10 out of 10 stars in a very long time. I enjoyed it immensely.",

It does have a couple of tension filled moments but quite as nail biting for me.Terrific performances all around. The stand out performance for me was Samuel L Jackson. Can't believe that was Nick Fury, incredible! My biggest disappointment was the character played by Christoph Waltz. I felt if his character in this movie was swapped with the one he played in Inglorious Basterds, there would be no difference what so ever. Not sure why Tarantino would do that, except for the fact the Waltz plays that character brilliantly.Overall, I think what works most, is that Tarantino has given this movie some breathing room from Inglorious Basterds (unlike the rapid fire from M. Night Shyamalan which grew tiring quickly). If this movie had come out a couple of years earlier, it would have been far more disappointing.",

Blood is always his favorite color and the great gouting splashes of it here are a signature and endearing trademark.When I first started watching his work I thought, this is a wild child of Scorsese. But then there were just to many flashes of other influences I saw, until finally I sort of gave up thinking about it He's drawn from so many sources and it still comes out Tarantino.He's forged a signature in film. Meta violent, witty, twisting, a constant rainbow of brilliant action and beautifully set up shots. One in particular comes to mind when Fox and the German are riding silhouetted into a sunset framed by old buildings. It epitomizes the genre he's playing with here with a corny but wonderfully framed and beautiful shot.He, like, several special directors, like working repeatedly with the actors they know, so you see several of them here too.This happens sometimes with me, and a good review should be short on the \"me\" part of it, but sometimes, when you have directors with overwhelming presence ,(and Tarantino cameos like Hitchcock), and I don't mean their bodies, I mean their huge directorial and in this case written input, my commentary focuses more on the concept then a given actor's performance.Such us the case here. Fox is great, so's everyone. But it's the whole nonstop action rainbow of the movie itself that satisfies, this semi-prequel to Hateful Eight may surpass it in some ways. It's hard to say and a largely irrelevant ponder, since see all his work to this point as one gigantic movie with different chapters.Of course actors like Sam Jackson give that notion a certain obvious consistency, but like any fine composition or musical ensemble, it's a team effort, and this director makes some mighty fiery and beautifully crafted things, and everybody's got an oar deep in the water, so, again, a little OCD, it's the whole thing that makes an impression to me, which isn't meant to belittle the component performances of obviously great actors.But it is, largely a toast to the director that assembles these unique, eminently watchable, funny, violent, brilliantly crazy canvasses.",

The movie is a bonanza for the fans of QT since it has just about everything they would expect in a QT movie. Many critics of QT will perhaps agree that he is indeed a very talented director who has been called\" the single most influential director of his generation \",some years back. Right from the first scenes where the dentist Dr. Schultz ( with a huge model of a tooth atop his horse carriage ) negotiates for the purchase of black slave Django to the last signature scenes of mayhem where the liberated Django rescues his wife, the film keeps the audience riveted. No wonder QT has won the awards for best screenplay from 3 different academies. QT's direction is a treat for lovers of good cinema. A good portion of the film is dialogue driven with lengthy though simple lines and there are a number of extended scenes .A very long drawn sequence at the dining table where Leonardo DiCaprio and Dr. Schultz are negotiating the sale is shot in great detail' It is very interesting to see that the movie unfolds at a leisurely pace in the first half or so where QT marries the music,framing and dialogue in his usual stylistic manner. Considerable footage is given to the male bonding between Dr. Schultz and Django which goes beyond the master -slave relationship. Specially absorbing is the doctor's explanation of how easily he goes about his bounty hunter's job. Some superlative performances are seen in this film. Jamie Foxx as Django lives the role and does not have much talking to do ; but his expressions do the talking. His costume changes as the film progresses have been questioned but its not a big issue. On the other hand Christoph Waltz as Dr. Schultz has considerable amount of dialogue which he delivers in great style. Some of his punches remind us of the older Dollar films.of Sergio Leone. He is excellent as the bounty hunter who goes about acquiring and eliminating criminals wanted dead or alive by the authorities. Maybe it is Leonardo DiCaprio who steals the show with his sinister interpretation of the cruel Mississippi plantation owner. Probably some hamming was the requirement of the character and he carries it off well. Because of the different makeup most people would hardly recognize Samuel Jackson as Leonardo's Butler plus henchman and he also has given an excellent performance.A little bit of trivia for movie buffs. Franco Nero ,who played the title role of Django in the spaghetti western of 60's has done a cameo as the gunslinger at the bar who is told that in the name Django ,D is silent Quentin had earlier described this movie as a \"southern \"on the lines of the spaghetti westerns in view of the subject of black slavery in the southern states.Filmologists have brought out that the Quentin Tarantino style essentially consists of a non linear story line, stylistic use of camera/ editing dialogue driven scenes, and music married to visuals. This movie has all this in abundance and more. Those who have liked QT's earlier successful movies like Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill ( 1 and 2 ) , and Inglorious Basterds would love this film equally well. While this film should be highly satisfying for the QT fans, the uninitiated who are not into QT type of movies may not enjoy it.",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino has been plundering cult cinema for over twenty years now, with varying degrees of success. Django Unchained sees the director turning to the Spaghetti Western for inspiration, borrowing film-making techniques from the greats of the genre (most notably Sergios Leone and Corbucci) while adding his own trademark touches-snappy banter and over-the-top violence. The result is something of a mixed bag-some of it works brilliantly, much of it is unremarkable yet still entertaining, and some of it is embarrassingly bad. Fortunately, the positives outweigh the negatives, the overall result being far from Tarantino's best work, but a long way from his worst as well.The good points include a decent soundtrack (something that QT has always managed to get right), excellent performances from the film's primary cast members (Christoph Waltz putting in a particularly good turn as bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz), a decent supporting cast that includes both big name actors and cult favourites, lots of very brutal violence, and a few well executed action scenes, the film's highlight being a brilliantly choreographed and extremely gory shootout between Django and numerous soon-to-be-dead gun-toting bad guys, the equivalent of Kill Bill's blood drenched Crazy 88s fight (it's such an exhilarating scene it makes one wonder why QT didn't cut some of the jibber-jabber and devote more of the running time to action).Of the more woeful content, we get a supposedly humorous exchange between various members of a hooded raid party that is painfully unfunny, the expected cameo performance by QT (as a slave-driver) which is up to his usual low standard, far too much 'filler' (the film could have been shorter: it doesn't feel epic enough to warrant such a long running time), and a finale that, although explosive, still comes as something of a disappointment after the aforementioned shootout scene.",

            "content": "Tarantino is one of those writers/actors that whilst you sometimes abhor what they bring to the screen, in terms of things you don't want to see, you can't deny they are geniuses. I hate the bad language, gratuitous violence and most of the subject matter in his films but I have to admit his films are brilliant (albeit I have to look away occasionally). Django Unchained is one of his best, in my opinion. The story is interesting, gripping and really poignant... it's about slavery and addresses it boldly and holds a light up to it without mincing it's words. The injustice of slavery is portrayed to graphic effect but I was expecting the atrocities to be a lot worse, and so was pleasantly surprised by this film being so comedic. It was really really funny, even the cringeworthy bits have humour, which is very unusual. Tarantino has a gift; he stares deplorable acts in the face and still sees the humour in storytelling without detracting from the power or importance.Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx were brilliant together; Waltz was a lovely character, and there was great chemistry between them and I'm sure they had fun with their scenes. Foxx inhabited Django fearlessly and was really committed giving a very physical performance. Di Caprio's Francophile Candie was dreadful but well played, with shades of Johnny Depp all the way through, and was hateful despite there being humour, even when he was at his most despicable. Kerry Washington took on a brave and exposing role and was predictably superb. Everyone in the cast was incredible and gave grade A performances which in turn gave the film such added star quality... but I think Samuel L Jackson(almost unrecognisable) employed the greatest transformation for his role. A trouble with all of the characters was that they were all so horrible (except Schultz, Django and Broomhilda) that you really didn't care about the awful ends that befell them - in many cases they weren't untimely enough! Brilliant acting, great story, but as it was Tarantino there was lots of animation-style blood special effects which were overblown and unbelievable (not realistic) and one particularly shoot out was a little ridiculous. However, that added to the comedy 'One Night at McCools' kind of finale which added to the entertainment of the film and was hallmark Tarantino! There was much that was playful and homage to old films and art-direction, which gave it an older style look, and more serious. Lots of nasty things happened to horses, which I didn't like, but I was happy to see a \"no horses were harmed in the making of this film\" note at the end. The scenery was fantastic and the soundtrack awesome - loved the John Legend track amongst others.Overall, great entertainment, gripping and well written, well worth all the plaudits, and praise, for the actor's portrayals. Whilst largely a drama that was highly comedic, intentionally or not, it was a stark reminder of America's past in terms of the brutality of slavery and some of the scenes - as such - were quite distressing, and difficult, but could have been a lot worse given what went on and what Tarantino (look out for his cameo - his brief and explosive performance) has done in the past. Also look out for a cameo from Franco Nero, the original Django in the 1966 film - a cameo and homage.",

Jackson steals the show as the evil butler who becomes the thorn in the hero's side, but you know it's inevitable that he'll get his due (and he does). Jamie Foxx looks good, but kind of gets lost in all the muscular scenery chewing being dished up by the other actors, the relationship between him and his wife doesn't really come off.

Don't know why it won anything, a famous director wallowing in his own cleverness.More specifically, the film is not tight, like I expect from Tarantino.

In my opinion, the best scene was when DiCaprio cornered Dr.King and Django on the dinner table. Oh my god! That was awesome. That is where the tension in the movie raised to the peak and in my opinion that is the place where the movie should have ended. He should have kicked all their asses, hammered the girl and Django. However, after that point, Tarantino insistingly extends the scenes and succeeds to turn the tension he just created into boredom. Sorry guys but I got so bored and disappointed afterwards. How can he let DiCaprio get killed? That is ridiculous. What is all that handshaking stupidity? Would you look at that? Someone like DiCaprio forgot to search them for additional pistols. Sorry guys but I got so mad at Tarantino for taking us for a fool. Afterwards the movie continued as a superhero movie. And that part was for children under 13. It was like a torture to me.

            "content": "If you thought \"Inglourious Basterds\" was revolting, wait until you see \"Django Unchained\". There is a sequence in the film where two slaves engage in an incredibly brutal brawl and an injured slave endlessly screams from the pain that has been inflicted on him. Moments later, the sequence climaxes and we see the winning slave bludgeoning the injured one to death with a hammer, which is mostly off-screen because the camera lingers on the other characters in the room. The sequence is intensely horrific, strangely audacious, and, in a way that can only be described as occult, fascinating because it says a lot of the characters. \"Django Unchained\" is the second historical epic from the freshly pickled imagination of Quentin Tarantino and the second one where he invents a history of his own, with inexorably gloating pleasure I might add.Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave who is freed by a German dentist-turned-bounty- hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) from the shackles of a chain-gang. Django, who alone knows how the Brittle Brothers, Schultz's next victims, look like, accepts the offer that Schultz proposes to him. As they partner in bounty-hunting till the end of winter, Django becomes increasingly obsessed in finding his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is rumored to be in the Mississippi plantation Candyland, belonging to Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). The plot traces the attempts of Django and Schultz to rescue Broomhilda from the egotistic Candie.In the ingenious world of Tarantino, the only thing predictable is how every single thing will make sense in the end. Gleefully excruciating from the word 'go', it takes a Tarantino to dazzle you with the fastidious violence, made majestic by the magical sound of Ennio Morricone. You can't do much but helplessly watch on as Tarantino's wondrous language protrudes the plot, often punctuating it with brutal gunfights and an irresistible undercurrent of dark humor. In a splendid sequence in the middle which is sure to make you cackle till it hurts, we see a bunch of bumbling Klu Klux Klan members complaining about the masks they have been made to wear. He stealthily, coyly and effectively sneaks in quivering tension in it too and does it all too well. Cinematographer Robert Richardson does his bit, masterfully capturing the flying droplets of blood that land on the flowers beds in the fields. The questions that often come up while watching a Tarantino film are : Has he done too much? Is he trying too hard? Isn't the plot a bit excessive? Yes, on all counts. But, then again, it's Tarantino we're talking about. And boy, has he got a way to do it.Though technically sound, \"Django Unchained\" lacks the finesse and the diabolical cleverness that was much more prominent in Tarantino's last film, \"Inglourious Basterds\". Cramming every single idea that will go with the story is amusingly absurd, but here's an attempt to do it anyway. Close to three hours, the film begins to drag at the end, partly because the director isn't done with showing the heroics of his hero. This leads to another twenty minutes of nonsensical blood splattering, which was completely extraneous.Of the performances, Christoph Waltz, who was brilliant in \"Inglourious Basterds\" is a marvel as Schultz, portraying him with the right amount of swagger and menace. DiCaprio and Samuel Jackson, in a supporting role, likewise are equally good. Foxx is slightly underwhelming as Django but manages to give a dignified performance.\"Django Unchained\" isn't Tarantino's best film, but it's a tad better than \"Inglourious Basterds\" because Tarantino exerts a calm control over the script, something he faltered in in his last directorial outing. It's one film that makes you squirm in your seat even if you're not the squeamish type but it's a gorgeous piece of cinema that's unabashedly well worth a ticket. Succinctly put, it's an outrageous, darkly comic bloodbath that is as appalling as it is entertaining.",

But I love him for creating such original, provoking, entertaining and brilliantly acted form of modern art. What this time struck me, is Tarantino's tribute to Italian artists with the padre of Spaghetti Western, Sergio Leone, as well as Sergio Corbucci, who directed the original Django, starred by Franco Nero who had a small cameo appearance. The unique melodies of Ennio Morricone dominated again as the perfect soundtrack of Django Unchained while Elisa (Ancora Qui) song deserves credit if not an award. If you, like myself, hate Tarantino for being cocky and showing off, Django Unchained will give you a noisy slap on your face and make you love one of the best directors of the past decades.",

How is it possible that this film has less than the pleasant but not exceptional \"Shawshank Redemption\", and the stifling bore that is \"Godfather\" (any 3 of its should-have-been-aborted parts)!? Quentin Tarantino comes across as an absolute idiot (I tried to put another word here, but IMDb did not allow it..) so it pains me to say this, but it cannot be denied that he is one of the most talented writers/directors of all time. He just is. The film was exceptional - from the moment it started it was beautifully shot, comical, vengeful, well-written, fast-paced and full of tension at the appropriate times. I normally can't stand violent films, but this is so amazing that the horrific, gratuitous violence spouting out at seemingly 30 second intervals is a joy instead of unpleasant.The acting, oh the acting! Christopher Waltz is an incredibly talented man, as is Leonard DiCaprio (who is dashingly handsome, even playing a villain)and of course the legend that is Samuel L. Jackson - I was very impressed with Jamie Foxx too. However, the acting would be nothing without the superb characters these men were given to play.I can't say enough good things about this film (clearly). It is refreshing to see a film on a delicate topic such as slavery, but one handled with a mixture of emotions and not the usual \"it's awful, it's awful, white guilt, white guilt\" bit.

The year is 1858 and Django (Jamie Foxx) is a loving husband to his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is tragically separated from her when he is enslaved purely for the colour of his skin. He fortuitously meets a bounty hunter named Dr King Schultz (Christopher Waltz) who frees him and they form a strong bounty hunting partnership. Together they set out to find Broomhilda who is now being held captive by a sadistic plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). It's a very brave film in the same vein as 12 Years A Slave, Steve McQueen's incredible film released the same year with very similar themes. 12 Years was a much more emotional and serious depiction of this time whereas Django is definately played more for entertainment value. Nevertheless, it does still contain some repulsive imagery which fuels the audiences hatred for the villains and the desire for Django to reek his revenge. This along with wonderful realisation of characters makes this a film so worthy of its awards attention in 2012-2013. The violence Django inflicts, the complete opposite of the sadism of his captors, is gloriously cathartic and captured in visually stunning blood splattered carnage. In turns hyperactive and delivering great monologues, this is well worth a watch on the biggest screen you can find. Kerry Washington is severely underrated in this also; she is the emotional core of the story and is tremendous",

            "review_title": "Django Unchained",
            "content": "The film Django Unchained by Quentin Tarantino talks about a story of a slave called Django bought by a German bounty hunter called King Schultz, trained by him, kills the Brittle brothers and eventually saves his wife. This Western film takes the audience back to the South, to the time when bounty hunters were making money by killing criminals. As the plot combines slavery and violence, the idea of social justice is fairly unique, presents a morality that is far beyond the common sense of people in the 21st century.From the start, King Schultz behaves differently compare to the White characters. He kills Ace. After all, he points his gun at him because he doesn't want to sell him Django. He suggests the rest of the slaves kill Ace's brother so that they can be free. Although he's a White man, he doesn't represent the benefit of the White slave owners, who have plantations. At least, from apparent, the only thing that drives him is the reward for killing criminals. In dealing with the Speck brothers, he acts like an outlaw. But interestingly, his goal of killing the Brittle brothers is within the legal boundary. It makes me start to think, King Schultz probably killed the Speck Brothers because he believes slavery is unjust.As King Schultz takes Django to a town, the focus switches from slavery to racism. When Django rides a horse on the street next to King Schultz, the n-word comes out of the mouth of the White characters multiple times. One example is the innkeeper. How King Schultz scares him is not revealed in the film, but possibly through his gun. Eventually, the innkeeper runs away and screams \"help.\" From my perspective, this scene shows the connection between social justice and power. So far in the film, King Schultz is the one with power, his gun, his skills, and confidence.Django gradually owns the power by killing the Brittle brothers. That power grows stronger after keeps practicing his shooting skills. Soon after, they get to Candyland plantation to free Django's wife, Broomhilda. Calvin, the owner of the plantation, is furious about their lie and changes the deal at the last minute from $12,000 for one of his best fighters plus a nominal amount for Broomhilda to $12,000 for only for her with death threats. For King Schultz, Calvin's arrogant, racist and violent behavior disgusts him. To fight back, he tells Calvin that Alexandre Dumas, the author of The Three Musketeers that he often uses to name his slaves is a Black people. As a man with the desire to win, Calvin asks him to shake his hand as a type of humiliation. King Schultz kills him with a gun. Calvin's bodyguard then shoots him. Now, Django has to fight for himself. When he starts to use his talent for revenge, the power has transferred to his hand, although not entirely, since he surrenders, because Steven and Billy take Broomhilda as a hostage.Steven, the most powerful African man in Candyland plantation, plays the role of an accomplice that kills and tortures people of the same race as him. He frequently uses the n-word to describe them and has totally no empathy. Django recognizes that. He slaughters all the White people on the plantation and lets all the Africans leave except Steven after he manages to free himself by lying to the slavers and frees his wife. For Django, Steven has no difference compared to the White slave owners. Eventually, he fires the bomb, then blows out the building. His justice has been accomplished by using his power.To sum up, the social justice in the film is accomplished through the use of power which comes in the form of violence. The more power you have, the more justice you receive. The criminals who conduct the crime of enslaving Africans are punished through that. The film differentiates King Schultz and Steven from their race. Indeed, King Schultz is a White man, but he isn't racist and is portrayed as a righteous man. Steven, an African who never fights for his own race and chooses to become an accomplice of slavery, is depicted as an evil person. By doing this, the film implies that being good and evil has nothing to do with your race, but your mind and your view of social justice.",

What the movie is not: it's not an exploration of the social depths of slavery, it's not a psychological film about the effects of slavery and the people who suffered, etc What it is: a comedy/action flick, mildly gory.The good: - Waltz does an amazing role, his character is funny & witty and keeps a balance between the ruthlessness of a bounty hunter (which he thoroughly justifies) with a soft spot against slavery - there's a good balance between violence and comedy, more so than in other similar movies - it's entertaining if you're into this side of Tarantino's work (and you don't expect any underlying message) - it's in line with Tarantino's new trend of the oppressed rising against oppression (like Inglorious Basterds) which yields loads of satisfaction to see the inhuman beings punished - i loved the ending scene, with Hildi smiling (one could say it's an idiotic smile, but perfectly justified in its outstanding joy) when seeing the Candie manor blown to bits (a very thorough destruction of everything that Candie stood for) - Django's evolution from freedom and into western gunman is described well enough (half the movie dedicated to it). - Enio Morricone on the soundtrackThe bad: - everyone seems to be shooting only arteries, which gets boring fast (one shoots the same body for the 5th time and it still sprays blood two meters away? sheesh ....) - I know this is supposed to be a caricature type of exaggeration but still ... - when D'Artagnan gets ripped by dogs - it's supposed to underline Candie's brutality and ruthlessness that mirrors his pretense for \"refinement\", however the scene itself is sketchy, the brutality goes between gratuitous and irrelevant - hip-hop on the soundtrack (it does not fit with anything in the movie, pacing, scenes, etc) it only taints an otherwise competent soundtrack - editing is chaotic at times, scenes don't always flow smoothly",

Similar to \"Blazing Saddles\" in its approach to using a sort of dark comedy to shed some light on a very disturbing chapter of human history. I loved Christoph Waltz as the German dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. Schulz. Great performance. Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson do an equally impressive job as the sinister pair Calvin and Steven. Brilliant dialogue, beautiful cinematography. I love when Tarantino pulls out a lot of old school film techniques to give it a retro sort of feel.One of my favorite westerns of all time. Or should I say southern? Anyways this is among Tarantino's better films, perhaps even his second best, and along with the more down to earth depiction in \"12 Years a Slave\" is some of the best on screen commentary on the history of slavery. Excellent film.",

            "content": "Having looked forward to Django for a very long time, I saw it last night (the UK release date) and it was almost too good to be true. Few things in life live up to your expectations, but this film delivers on virtually ever level. Django Unchained is stunning to look at; the cinematography is incredible from the very start and it soon becomes clear that Tarantino has put his heart & soul into this film. I would highly recommend seeing it on the big screen; there are so many scenes that take your breath away and several that justify the (rather expensive) cost of seeing a film at the cinema these days.The story gets going very quickly and, although not the most complex plot in the world (as with other QT films), it is very engaging with many surprising moments and easily holds your attention for the whole 165 minutes. Some have said that 120 minutes would have been plenty, but when a film is this good I'm more than happy for it to keep going!As you'd expect from a Tarantino film, the characters are well thought- out and quite intriguing. Several stand out as very interesting indeed but it would be hard to go into that without spoilerage. However, I will say that the portrayal of these interesting characters from the cast is fantastic with Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel Jackson delivering career-best performances in my mind. Jamie Foxx is also brilliant but it's certainly not all about him (despite the title!) and although he's perfect for playing Django (especially the attitude), his character is quite straight-forward. Walton Goggins is also very good and appears perfectly cast in a role that he seems to relish. The sudden appearance of Quentin himself brings a smile and I loved the back-and- forth between him & Django. I don't think there's any danger that he'll be stealing any acting Oscars though! Along with the characters, the dialogue is first class with so many fantastic moments that it's hard to describe what a great screenplay Tarantino has produced. Shultz and Candie have some incredible lines to deliver and some of Django's insolent one-liners are instant classics. Along with the length of the film, another often-heard criticism is the 'excessive language' used. I didn't find this at all and found the language to be appropriate and proportionate to the times and the situation. Violence and language are just favourite sticks that some like to wave at Mr Tarantino in order to get a reaction. We all know what to expect from a Tarantino film and if anyone is concerned about swearing or bloodshed then a wide berth would be recommended. The topic of slavery is refreshingly different and I think it's a brilliant idea for Quentin Tarantino to tackle it in this manner. It feels like we the audience are experiencing disgust at this repugnant world through the eyes of Dr Shultz, the foreign outsider. As you would expect, it is very shocking in places and we are left in no doubt as to QT's opinion on this shameful part of America's history. That said, it feels like he has held back to a certain extent and, although he walks right up to the line, he doesn't cross it in my opinion. You get the impression that he could easily have been far more graphic, but that would have changed the overall feel of the film. As it is, Django Unchained succeeds in being simultaneously funny, informative, shocking, intriguing, rewarding, surprising and, above all, highly entertaining. Great stuff.So far I have only given 10/10 to two films; Pulp Fiction and Leon. Is Django as good as those two? After just one viewing it is hard to say but, at this moment in time, I would say yes. It is most certainly a 9/10 but my experience suggests that most Tarantino films tend to get better with multiple viewings so I think a 10 is appropriate. Can't wait to see it again!",

            "content": "First off let me make it clear that this is a superb masterpiece that should have wiped the floor at the Oscars. There is more power, tension and drama in a couple of minutes of DiCaprio and a skull than in the whole of Argo. So whats so good about this film. Firstly its just a great story - a retelling of the Siegfried legend set against a backdrop of slavery and bounty hunting in the deep south of the US, just before the civil war. It is also a love story, a pupil / surrogate father figure story and perhaps most importantly a brutal account of the horrors of slavery. The second thing that is outstanding is the screenplay. It is littered with quotable lines, from the funny: \"That house we just left from, is The Big House. Big Daddy call it that cause it's big.\" to the plain scary: \"If you examine this piece of skull here, you will notice three distinct dimples\". In fact the screenplay is so good almost the whole thing is quotable. The final ingredient of this unforgettable film is the casting/acting which produces some wonderful characters: Dr King Schultz, a civilised, cultured bounty hunter, who although he has told Django that he must stay in character just cant do it himself when confronted with Candy's cruelty. Stephen, a brilliant personification of evil by Samuel l Jackson, the moment when Stephen sees Django approaching on a horse is an astonishing bit of acting, essentially with only the eyes. The eponymous Django who through a kind of right of passage changes from a scared slave to a vengeful hero. And perhaps I leave the best to last, the francophile Calvin Candy: DiCaprio captures deep evil and menace.",

But if it's a sequel or remake I know that If Django Unchained was that good, then Django must be pretty damn good and hopefully as violent.A lot of Tarantino's films are very bloody and violent, and so was this one. Some much bloodshed and violence which basically makes this movie what it is. Tarantino's films like Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds were very violent and gory at times but this one is just tops them all with new ways of killing and brilliant western style shoot em' up scenes.Tarantino won his second Academy Award for this movie and well deserved, very well written. Great acting which earned Waltz an Academy Award for best actor in a supporting role and it was also a star cast with Dicaprio and Samuel L. Jackson.Overall a good blood fest, with brilliant special effects, well written and was nominated for five Oscars. This will always be one of my favourite movies and deserves it spot in the top 250.

My one criticism though would probably be that while the first act is perfect and the third act is amazing, the second act doesn't feel like it really impacts the film that much, I'm not saying it's boring, there are some really fun set pieces but after the KKK have had their fun the film feels slightly aimless until we meet Leo.

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino never ceases to astonish us with his exceptional ability of making good movies that leave a rather unforgettable impression of his uniqueness.The movie raises the issue of slavery in the Antebellum Era which is a bit spiky subject to bring around and shows how that the black people themselves were yielding and submissive to such degree that made their own masters' wondering why would not they rise against them, but in the course of the movie we see that this idea is proved wrong.Aside from that Jamie Foxx was a brilliant choice for the main character, Django, a freed slave who happens to have a great skill in handling a gun also he has this proud bad-ass look that I liked.Christoph Woltz is such a great actor who was fit for the role of Dr. Schultz, a sophisticated dentist from a German origin who also practices a successful career as a bounty hunter, and it's really interesting how the course of the movie brings him and Django together and how they become partners in pursuing wanted criminals to get the prizes on their heads, then Dr. Shultz decides to help Django to buy his wife's freedom.The events gradually escalate to gather both of them with Monsiuer Candie, the Francophile slave owner of the Candyland plantation performed by Leo Di Capreo. For me, he was the intriguing element in the movie. I loved his role the most and loved how he took it so seriously especially in the scene when he confronts Dr. Shultz and Django about pulling their elaborate scam on him in order to rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda played by beautiful Kerry Washington, at the moment when he was supposed to slam his hand on the table, he accidentally slammed his hand into glass and had it cut and bled but he did not break character and got his job done perfectly in the most climatic scene in the movie.Let us not forget about Samuel L. Jackson who played the role of the old servant of the Candie family, Stephen, who appears to be so faithful and obedient to his master and very harsh on his fellow black people, he also ignites the conflict between Dr. Shultz and Monsieur Candie which represents the climax of the story.I also loved the fingerprint that Tarantino left, as in his other movies, represented by a bloodbath scene and a short cameo of himself which are just a typical trademark of his work.I believe it is safe to say that this particular picture shows how Tarantino's works have evolved to give us such an incredible combo of both diversity in subjects and an outstanding performance by the cast.",

It's rhetoric came from a German bounty hunter and provided mostly lessons in etiquette or rather a politer way in killing. A short story on Broomhilda the naked Visgoth queen. A lesson in submissive dimples if they existed found in mankind those who praise this film rather then question its creation.The story had holes throughout. The main was with a man who killed in front of son. This undermined the entire message of this film, freedom. Whatever his past was he should have been granted life as he moved away from that past and created a family. His past which was nothing more then a simple robbery. At night the rifle had no night vision. Why was he released after killing Candy, having you believe in stupidity. In the bible bashing south an eye is for an eye, this meant letting him live as what he already had been so he could escape and repeat it all again. Six shooter guns are standard issue in that time period yet more shots seemed to be fired with devastating spatter making a cannon redundant. Pointlessly serving no effect other to engage those who love that type paint splatter show, often found in cheesy horrors. There plenty more reasons why this 3 hour film was by no means anything but spectacular rather just a fuelling of tension of issues of a forgotten past in a pie in your face comic and spattered attempt.The acting was every actors attempt at hiding their smirking faces, as they struggled not to burst forth into laughter at the comedy in each line of their dialogue.As western go there was little in the way of natural beauty which comes from there locations of those rolling plains, forests, mountains, deserts and rivers.With other Trantino's their are plots within plots serving intricate story lines. Not in this film a mundane 3 hours repeating itself again and again the same plot. Gratuitous violence and a record how many times can the N word be said on screen.Granted this film while spawn a sequel. Already it has begun a generation of Django's. 5 out of 10",

            "content": "A wild-bloody, live action cartoon with a homicidal vengeance, a reversal of roles, much like \"Inglorious Basterds\"; rewriting history if you will, they way Quinten Tarantino sees it, and the way we enjoy it. Quinten takes his blood-spattered historical tent show on the road, putting down stakes in Antebellum Dixieland. Not technically a \"Basterds\" prequel, \"Django\" stems from a similar impulse, to reframe and rewrite American history in boldly absurd strokes. \"Inglorious Basterds\" is an exceptional film, but \"Django Unchained\" surpasses its predecessor, and then some.The movie opens in 1858 Texas with the unorthodox purchase of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), by a dentist-turned-bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christopher Waltz). Since Schultz doesn't believe in slavery, he soon frees Django and the two become partners in Schultz's business. After a profitable winter, they head to Mississippi where their goal is to locate Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). When they succeed, they find an excuse to be invited to the plantation where she is being held. There, they are guests of the mansion's master, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), where their act bamboozles everyone except Candie's personal slave, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), who smells a rat the moment he sets eyes on Django.When Tarantino first introduces audiences to the two characters we'll come to embrace and respect, it's while Django (Foxx) is chained up to other slaves as they march slowly in the dark in the middle of nowhere. Dr. Schultz arrives playing the role of a dentist in a scene that's close to being as perfectly written and delivered as Waltz' farmhouse scene from \"Basterds,\" freeing Django and thus begins a reluctant partnership. What starts as an uneasy alliance in which one side holds all the power, transforms over the course of the movie into one in which the unlikely pair become partners and friends. Delivering this transformation along with character development, Tarantino is at his screen writing best.There is not a single misstep by any of the \"Unchained\" cast. Led by Foxx as a slave- turned-bounty-hunter, and Waltz as a man with more layers than initially revealed, this ensemble is a perfectly cast with everyone at the top of their games. \"Django\" is an absolute must-see for Tarantino fans, but it's not necessary to be into either Tarantino or just Westerns to be fully entertained. There are many notable cameos: Don Johnson (small part), Jonah Hill, Amber Tamblyn, Bruce Dern, Tom Savini, Robert Carradine, and Franco Nero (who played the lead character in the unrelated 1966 film, Django).Tarantino is one of the few filmmakers that seamlessly and successfully merges style with substance. He is a creature of cinema, unashamedly standing on the shoulders of greats, forging new meaning out of the universal cultural experiences. That is why as far as I'm concerned \"Django Unchained\" is one of the best of 2012.",

In saying that, I must admit that I enjoyed his ode to the spaghetti westerns of days gone by and that using that template as a mirror to the great racial divide that has splintered America to its core since its beginning and has stayed unchanged was nothing short of audaciously brilliant.",

            "content": "Tarantino is at it again! Now, I never really saw any of this guy's movies with the exception of parts of \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\", where I instantly see his style of filmmaking, long running times and gallons of blood. Then this jolly little film comes out an I expected it to be a typical Western superhero-type film, kinda like the Lone Ranger, Jonah Hex, or even Zorro. What I actually saw was not what I expected.What we have here is a standard revenge story. Django was sold as a slave and separated from his lovely wife Broomhilda only to be liberated by a lovable German bounty hunter named Doctor Schultz. Schultz, unlike most folks at the time, pretty much dislikes slavery, so naturally he frees Django in return for being partners in justice as they set out to gain enough bounty to launch a rescue mission to save Broomhilda from the tyrannical white man.This story could have been done A lot better in a shorter screen time, but Tarantino misses the mark here. First of all, so many dialog scenes dragged on for eternity. The viewer will get the point after the first few minutes of the conversations, even though there are some subtle moments here and there. Second, there was a point where the film forgets it's an action film and the level of violence that is present is greatly exaggerated, people exploding like watermelons thrown into the jaws of alligators (which is to be expected from Tarantino). I found myself bored and finding many moments to be a little silly.I will give the film credit based on two performances. Jamie Foxx did fine in my opinion, but the ones who stand out are Christoph Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson. Christoph Waltz as Doctor Schultz was a great character, full of charm and is a very sly dog when it comes to action or words. Best character in the film, though the end result near the end of the film left me disappointed. Samuel Jackson is pretty funny sometimes, often to the point where I was laughing pretty hard.Aside from the mentioned performances, I don't see why people are praising this movie. It's really stupid, slower than a turtle with iron weights on its back, and a major letdown. Not to mention, it kept using the \"n-word\" so much; I have never heard such a continuous use of that word in my entire life and it really gets old very fast. I suggest you don't waste time with this film because it is SO not worth it.",

            "content": "This is an okay-decent movie. However, seeing its' place in the top 250, I kind of got my expectations up a little too high. It will not totally disappoint, but it is not one of the best movies of all time.First off, surprisingly, this is a pure western. I was never a huge fan of pure westerns. That being said, as far as pure westerns go, this is in fact one of the better ones I've ever seen. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly comes to mind as probably the best pure western I've seen so I can draw my comparisons from that. I also actually liked the Quick and the Dead, even though most critics didn't, and that's a modern classic western I can compare it with, which also stars DiCaprio. This movie has more substance to it than Quick and the Dead, but overall, it's not much different. If you do have a thing for westerns, then you will probably really like this movie.There are some minor complaints in my opinion. Being that it is supposed to be a classic pure western type of movie, at times it felt like Back to the Future III in that the main character often acted like it was 2012 even though it was supposed to be the late 1800s. One scene that comes to mind is when he's wearing hip shades while they're traveling through the prairies to Candyland. A bigger example is how and why they chose to play rap music during some of the scenes, especially the gun battles. I found this silly and retractable from the setting of the classic old west. It was like a mixture of cultures and I really didn't like the choice as it almost ruined the setting in a way. What they should have done was just go with classic western music or basic suspenseful music. I don't like when modern movies do stuff like this. It ruins the authenticity a little bit and takes away from the quality and movie experience, especially when they used it in the climactic scenes and shootouts. Samuel L Jackson's character literally looked like an African American version of Biff on Back to the Future II. I was wondering why he looked so familiar and it finally hit me. BTTF III was more clearly stating that it was in fact a combination of 1990 and the late 1800s as far as blending the cultures of the protagonists with the setting; Django Unchained not so much. This was a flaw.My other complaint about the film is that it was TOO LONG. Please, use some editing. They could have shaved off 10-15 minutes EASILY from this film just on long drawn out scenes like the trek through the country to Candyland and the drawn out sit down meetings consisting of heavy dialogue. It wasn't the dialogue that was the issue and I do like the added drama and pauses and suspense, but for a film to be this long due to extra drawn out scenes so much is unnecessary. How the entire final scene begins with Django talking the transporters into the bounty and letting him go was a little bit far fetched too, but Im not going to discredit it too much as the writing needed a device to get him back on the road to Candyland and this will do. My issue is that again, it just took way too long to get this final scene going; I would have rather had the major gun battle be the final scene and just have Django rescue his wife and blow the place up there- it would have saved another 20 minutes.That being said, this was a very well acted and well constructed movie overall. Any time you have to recreate the old west, it's going to be a challenge, and for that I think they did a good job. Waltz was great again, and they had an all-star cast of supporting actors. This was some of DiCaprio's best work, but as I watched it, I really couldn't help but think to myself how much better his character would have been with Gene Hackman in that role. This is not taking anything away from Dicaprio's excellent performance, but I thought his character could come across a little more cruel if he wasn't so young looking. Still, Dicaprio pulls it off with flying colors.The best scenes are in the beginning and middle. This movie is so long that it sets itself up on its' own to have very slow and boring parts that as I mentioned could have been edited to make the movie even better. Still, it makes up for much of its' flaws with its' dialogue, acting, cinematography, originality, and overall interesting story. It's an okay film but sloppy and silly, and not one of the best of all time.",

Jamie Foxx was quite good as well. Leonardo DiCaprio superbly portrayed his character, along with Samuel Jackson, who also nailed his role. Other supporting cast were quite good as well. Cinematography, sound designs and the blood splashes and gore violence were superbly done. Action might be just a bit over-the-top, but it was thoroughly entertaining. The writing and directing was off the charts fantastic, and is the major plus point of this movie.

It had more than a few disturbing scenes, especially revolving around Leonardo DiCaprio's character. It was so grotesque that I had to leave the room. My boyfriend tried to excuse it by saying that was what really happened. How common those specific things happened is debatable because slaves were good for business, so wantonly killing them off would have cut into an owner's business. Based on my research as an African American History minor (English major), slave owners would reprimand male slaves only to discourage rebellion and escaping, not for their own personal entertainment like in this movie. Women were raped of course, but I doubt that the things in this movie were commonplace during slavery. Even if it was commonplace, that is not a reason to either make a movie about it or be entertained by it. It is a fact that some children are violently sexually abused and raped, but I don't want to see that depicted in a movie either. It is also a fact that some people to the same to animals, but, again, I don't want to see a movie about that either. In conclusion, I feel that the people behind the scenes, the actors, and even the people who like being entertained by this movie are all mentally diseased. Honestly, I am even looking at my boyfriend sideways, wondering what is wrong with him to like garbage like this. As an African-American woman, I was deeply offended by this movie and I hope this is the last grotesque movie about slavery ever to be made.

There was lot of racism,blood,cruelty and violence but its always fun in a QT movie as these are his basic ingredients. After all, he is one guy who can make the audience laugh when there is some thing brutal going on the screen.Its very hard to name out any single character's acting as the best in DU as everyone did their roles to their best-est. Wow, what great ravishing roles for Waltz and Caprio. Would have loved if Caprio had appeared for some more time as his character raced off like a flash. Foxx was not that impressive at first but he totally rocked in the last half hour. Jonah Hill and QT's little cameos were funny and impressive. But indeed it was Samuel's role as Stephen which I liked the most. Its pretty hard to differentiate his other roles with this one. Oscar awaiting for someone from here.!As usual Tarantino's selection of soundtrack suited the movie so well. Overall,QT has redefined the Western genre in his style and the output is a classic! If justice is balance, this movie should at least get an Oscar for his brilliant screenplay. Instead of dubbing silly action movies in Indian regional languages, they could go ahead dub this one. Maybe if it was 20 years back, both Rajinikanth and Kamal Hassan would have suited better in reprising the roles of Django and Schultz.Django Unchained along with The Dark Knight Rises are the best & greatest movies of 2012 in my opinion. 100% positive!",

This time, the protagonist is a freed slave, out to take back his love and enact a bloody revenge on those who shackled and savaged the pair of them. Jamie Foxx puts in a more-than-serviceable performance as the intense, hard-bitten Django, but he finds himself somewhat overshadowed by Christopher Waltz as his smart-tongued, soft-hearted, bounty-hunting liberator and compadre, Dr King Schultz. Samuel L. Jackson puts in a hilarious and horrifying turn as the servile-yet-sharp house slave Stephen, serving as formidable backup for Leo Di Caprio at his bastardly best as plantation-owner Calvin Candie.Despite the close-to-three-hour running time, Tarantino avoids burdening the film with the tangential self-indulgence that marred his previous outing, Inglourious Basterds. Instead, we get a decent blend of characterisation, cameos, comedy, and carnage which come together to form a memorable slab of spaghetti southern blaxploitation. Some of Tarantino's soundtrack choices prove kinda jarring (Hip-hop...in this setting!?), and he could do with proofreading his historical accuracy at certain points, but overall, I think he got more right than wrong with this one.

He asks if Django knows the Brittle Brothers and with the affirmative, he kills one of his masters and takes Django for himself, but treats him like an equal. Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is a slave that speaks German. Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams-up with him during the winter, he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts his new deal and they become friends. After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft (Leonardo DiCaprio), who lives in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi. Dr. Schultz plots a scheme with Django to lure Calvin and rescue Broomhilda from him. But his cruel minion Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) is not easily fooled.From anybody other than Quentin Tarantino, this would be their life's best work, but from Quentin, this was a little underwhelming, especially after having done the brilliantly subversive Inglourious Basterds with such perfection before this one. Here he excessively panders to his own vices, especially in the third act. The spatterfests were too silly and overlong. Jamie Foxx is inconsistent and doesn't convincingly pull off his character throughout the movie and this becomes more obvious towards the end when everything rests on his shoulder without Waltz and Di Caprio supporting him. For a movie that is all about him, he makes for one hell of a boring character and the actor wasn't able to bring many emotions that the character did require. The first choice for the role was apparently Will Smith who declined the role, and in my opinion, he would have made a good Django Freeman. Jackson was hilarious and Waltz was great as usual, but Di Caprio surprised me big time. He should have also been nominated for an Oscar for his flamboyant and sadistic performance. Kerry Washington is nothing but a damsel in distress which is consistent with the time and racism that prevailed back then. Tarantino also played two characters in the movie to hilarious effect. At the end of the day, this is a pure cinematic experience with great music and songs integrated with such fluidity along with sweeping visuals and reminds me of why I love movies so much.8/10",

This film is easier to follow than some of the best Tarantino films, which is good for enjoying the film but disappointing if you like Tarantino's complexity such as the out-of- chronology plot of Pulp Fiction.However, one element that is maybe better in this film than some previous Tarantino works is the use of dialogue and monologues to create elaborate metaphors through their subtext, which is surprising because Tarantino has already proved to be a master of dialogue. The best scene of this film is probably when Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) is presenting a skull of a slave to Schultz and Django and talking about dimples within the skull that represent a slave's submissiveness in order to illustrate that not just slaves, but all black people (including and especially Django) need to be put in their place. It is one of the best monologues written by Tarantino, and an accident on set made the scene even creepier: DiCaprio wasn't supposed to actually cut his hand in the scene by smashing a glass, and he wipes his actual blood on Broomhilda's (Kerry Washington's) face which elevates his menace to a whole new level. Other important dialogue in this film includes Schultz telling the legend of Broomhilda, racists complaining about the bags on their heads, and Schultz reflecting on what Alexandre Dumas would think of Candie's evilness.While I'm happy that Christoph Waltz got another Oscar for a performance in a Tarantino movie, I'm a little surprised by this at the same time. Hans Landa was a much more complex character than Schultz, and Waltz rightfully deserved his Oscar for that role, but in this film, while some moments with Schultz were undeniably funny, all I saw was a bounty hunter with great diction and good wit from time to time. I'm not saying his performance wasn't good, but attempting to look at the film objectively, I don't see how Waltz should have necessarily been the front-runner for the Oscar.I'm surprised that this film is ranked so highly on IMDb, seeing that my third favorite Tarantino film is Inglourious Basterds, but what I have to admit is that this is probably one of the funniest Tarantino films to date with many good moments where Schultz steals the scene and especially the scene with the racists complaining about bags on their faces. Even the most violent scene of the movie is funny at parts since a worker on Candie's plantation gets shot a ridiculous amount of times, sometimes by his dumb partners, and he lives longer than he should and keeps screaming and becoming more agonized throughout the shootout.I generally really like this movie, but the third act is a little disappointing in my opinion, and I think Tarantino could have written the ending in a more satisfying way if it were close to or combined with the biggest shootout of the film. But then again, I guess an ending like that would have been too simple or would have seemed like a cop out. What Django has to say at the end of the film is pretty great though, and I wouldn't change that a thing about that, but towards the end of the film it seemed 20 minutes longer than it should have been.A very good Tarantino movie (though when is he NOT good?), but not one of his best. But maybe I'm of that unpopular opinion because I have a bias towards Westerns? Who knows?3.5/4.0",

            "content": "It is a preposterous meeting. It's past midnight, in the darkest part of the forest, on a brittle winter evening. Traveling by horseback from a nearby auction, in which they purchased a handful of slaves, the Speck Brothers (James Remar, James Russo) are traders of infamy, their cruelty reflected in the way they force their newfound property to travel by foot, barely clothed. The journey is slow, brutal, its stagnant pacing suddenly interrupted by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German ex-dentist currently making a living through bounty hunting. One could ask how Schultz, sans GPS (let alone technology), is able to track down the Specks in this dense Texas forest in the middle of the night \u2014 but I won't go there.Having caught wind of one of the Specks' purchases, Django (Jamie Foxx), Schultz has sought him out in hopes to gather information about the Brittle Brothers, for whom he has a warrant. Django, it seems, has such a terrifying past regarding the siblings that forgetting their faces is an impossibility; Schultz, figuring that the slave is the man he needs to get the job done, frees him and shoots his owners. The two then embark on a risky journey, beginning with the eventual killing of the Brittles and ending with an unexpected, bloody dose of catharsis. The catharsis, dangerously, comes in the form of the daring rescue of Django's long-lost wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is currently owned by sadistic plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).Quentin Tarantino is, if not the greatest filmmaker of his generation, a provocateur. Excess is better than suggestion, so it's a relief that Tarantino likes to work in broad strokes instead of meticulous, celluloid shaded pointillism. Ever since he introduced himself to the world with 1992's groundbreaking \"Reservoir Dogs\", Tarantino's diverse filmography has done nothing but portray just how risky of a filmmaker he is, how he's matured, how he's gotten so comfortable with pushing boundaries that boundaries eventually become little black dots on the horizon as he rides off into the sunset in his godforsaken Pussy Wagon. That being said, \"Django Unchained\" is, without a doubt, his most love-it-or-hate-it film. Those who hate it will despise how it surrounds the sensitive issue of slavery with pulp flavor and violence used jokingly instead of with weight; but those who love it will relish Tarantino's dialogue (and slippery as ever), the glowing performances, the spaghetti western setting, the in-your-face treatment of it all. As much as I loved \"Django Unchained\", it's easy to see how it could offend the easily offended. The splatter is more plentiful than it was in \"Inglourious Basterds\" (it's more reminiscent of the unrelenting carnage of \"Kill Bill\"), N-words abound, and cruelty becomes a language more common than English. But Tarantino, despite having a blast with his story, uses the splatter as a call-to-action, the N-word as an authentic part of the dialect the many racist characters spit out, cruelty as a reminder that times in pre-War South were nothing but long washes of atrocious bigotry and violence. The most controversial scene in the movie (and there are many), comes in the form of a crude fight to the death between two slaves, enforced by DiCaprio's Candie. As inhuman as the scene is, however, Tarantino's goal isn't to entertain but to melodramatically develop Candie's character \u2014 as a man only the Devil could rival, the hatred we feel for him is so strong that when the fiendishly bloody first ending (there are two) arrives, it feels justified; it's as though Tarantino is giving a face to all the psychopathic slave owners of the past we never got to know, presenting us with an unspeakably barbarous reconfiguring of our past while poking slight fun at the monstrous ignorance and savageness of our ancestors.More impressive is how Tarantino can deliver such slick historical commentary while still managing to slide in hysterically funny sequences and moments of unrefined beauty. His best use of comedy comes early on during a KKK meeting: the members, planning to attack Django and Schultz following a sour meeting with a plantation owner, spend most of the grouping arguing about the tiny eyes holes in their bag masks rather than intelligently coming up with a foolproof plan. The scene, over-the-top and reflective of the idiocy of the time period, works as yet another satirical punch Tarantino executes with effortless mastery. His cinematographic delicacies fondle the Southern landscape in grande scale, mirroring the epics of John Ford and Howard Hawks; the way he surrounds the slaveowners with eye-catching affluence only reminds us that wealth wasn't always something to be desired, especially if you received it in vomit-inducing ways. Stronger is the cast, the smallest but most extraordinary of his films. After winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work in \"Inglourious Basterds\", Waltz gives yet another bravura performance through a similarly minded, silver-tongued characterization that allows him to deliver monologue after monologue and never lose our attention. Foxx is menacingly silent as a slave on an explosive path of retribution, Washington touching as his long-suffering wife, Samuel L. Jackson first-rate as Candie's psychotic right-hand man. But best is Leonardo DiCaprio \u2014 giving one of his finest performances here as the menacing Calvin Candie, he frighteningly goes back and forth between charming and fearsome; he is the best on screen villain in years.\"Django Unchained\" is many things: it's a reinvention of the Western (or, in this case, the Southern), a splendid character piece, and another argument for Tarantino's genius. He plans to retire at 60, but such a statement is easy to ignore \u2014 filmmakers as brilliant as Tarantino are so few and far between that a world existing without anticipation for another one of his films doesn't seem like a very fun place to live.",

            "content": "I would love to get inside good ol' Quentin's head and know exactly what his intentions were when making this thing as that would make it a damn sight easier to review the bugger. For me Django Unchained is potentially many things but fails to be specifically anything, making it almost an enigma. However I prefer to refrain from using that word as that sounds too much like a compliment.Is it a serious depiction of the age of slavery in America? Is it a buddy comedy? Is it a spoof? Is it a homage to westerns of a bygone era of cinema? Is it just an orgy of over the top violence? Well, there is potential for Django Unchained to be any of these things. However, all that it feels like is Mr. Self Indulgent being even more self indulgent than ever with no actual idea of what he is trying to specifically make. I fail to see how it is possible for this to be a serious document of a moment in history. I would be out of my depth commenting on this too much, but when there are so many moments of outrageously cheesy and over the top dialogue, as well as some outrageously hammy performances (DiCaprio and Sam Jackson in particular) and moments which are intended to be farcical and humorous this cannot simply be possible. There have also been complaints about the language used throughout the narrative, but I am not going to dwell on this as I think it is pretty obvious that this is not ever meant in a derogatory or insulting way. Anyone who knows me will know I have plenty of bad things to say about Tarantino, but I firmly believe the language used is solely there to represent the language used of the era it is set. However, to say Django Unchained is not like Blazing Saddles is not entirely true. There is far too much farcical humour here that is genuinely funny, but detracts from this ever being a serious film. It is the comedy and Tarantino's eye for snappy and witty dialogue that is Django Unchained's saving grace. The first third is an absolute blast; it is tremendous fun and works perfectly as a buddy comedy that never takes itself too seriously. Waltz is on top form and a joy to watch whenever he is on screen, Foxx is however very forgettable in what is supposed to be the title role. It is the charismatic and extremely likable character of Schultz that not only seems to drive the narrative forward but makes Django Unchained effortlessly watchable and tremendous fun.However, when the two protagonists go to retrieve from Von Hilda from Candie in the final two hours (!), this is when Django Unchained takes a serious nosedive and becomes almost knotted up in its own self awareness and indulgence. As with most Tarantino films Django Unchained contains many obvious moments of 'inspiration' from films and genres of the past. There is of course nothing wrong with this, but Quentin just seems to be like Peckinpah, then Sergio Leone, then John Ford. These are all great film makers of this genre, but here this just leads to a frustratingly uneven tone to the narrative which does actually get quite boring at times. Quentin is obviously a man full of ideas, but he needs to develop some kind of filter to know to leave the bad ones out of his films. There is still an amateurish sense of a man that knows a lot about films, but nothing about making films. I know a lot has been said about the running time, and I am afraid I will have to say I am in agreement as Django Unchained is at least 45 minutes too long. There are so many moments, both of action and dialogue that add nothing and just make Django Unchained an effort to watch. In the final third when the (occasional) action happens and the whole theme of 'vengeance' takes over this is once again all done with a lot of filler that detracts from the potential guilty pleasure fun that could be had by the ridiculously over the top violence. The whole experience feels very frustrating in that when things are going to kick off, they infuriatingly do not. There are also some very lazy plotting devices to keep things ticking over: The plot device that Schultz is German and Von Hilda was raised by Germans feels a little too contrived and almost Dickensian in terms of its neatness. This would work if the film was constantly tongue in cheek, but due to the running time and self indulgent tone, it cannot help but feel a little lazy. In my opinion, the fact is the protagonist and actual story are too weak for this to ever work as a serious character driven vengeance thriller, especially one that is 165 minutes. Also, two minor quibbles: A director cameo involving an embarrassing Australian accent and occasionally using 21st century rap music were very bad ideas Quentin! In summary, (yes, finally) with all the comedy, over the top performances, even more over the top violence and a (much) shorter running time, Django Unchained would work perfectly as a not to serious fun period romp that even gets away with a little self indulgence. It is certainly worth a watch with some genuinely great moments, but prepare to be frustrated by an uneven, inconsistent self indulgent narrative mess.",

            "content": "Having quite enjoyed Kill Bill and Inglorious Basterds, I was curious about Django. And in many respects I got what I expected.The start was promising, and Christoph Waltz was very good to watch, with Jamie Foxx easing into the role of the wronged avenger. And the bit later on with the hooded gang complaining about not being able to see as their hood's eye cutouts were too small was hilarious! But mainly it was just comic book cardboard cutout characters killing each other, with the ridiculous amounts of spurting blood reinforcing the unreality of it all in the final shootouts. The take home message? Justified revenge is the way to happiness, even if you have to destroy an entire race of whites to achieve it. But the most shocking aspect of this film to me isn't the film itself, which was in the end just silly to me - it's that so many critics and fans seem to think it's brilliant! Have we now become that indifferent to violence that corpses spurting blood everywhere is all just jolly good fun? If so, it might go some way to explaining the current gun crisis in the US, which only seems to be getting worse. I'll leave the statistics out, there are plenty online. Finally, obviously the film has the evil of slavery as the background against which all the revenge is justified. But there are a few people, Spike Lee included, who believe that this kind of Pulp Fiction treatment of \"what was effectively a holocaust\" is disrespectful of the countless victims of it. I tend to agree, but what does QT care? He keeps making PF-comic type films, and we keep lauding him for it. So expect to see his greatest masterwork anytime soon - my best guess is a Nazi concentration camp revenge flick, where the inmates get to kill the SS guards, probably in acid baths and many other torturous ways, and then go on a rampage killing the inhabitants of the local German village for turning a blind eye. All good clean revenge fun. In bad taste maybe? - who cares if it's the great QT, and he shoots it on old school cameras to keep the nerds happy!",

            "content": "In the American South and a few years before the Civil War, Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave who falls in with a fellow slave Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). His owners punish him by tearing them apart and selling him to new owners. On his way to his new plantation, he is rescued by a bounty hunter named Dr. Schultz (Christoff Waltz) who enlists him to find some criminals he's been hunting who happen to be Django's previous owners. Together they begin to work together to hunt down, kill criminals and collect bounties before reuniting Django with Broomhilda. But before they can be reunited, they must outwit her owner Calvin Candie, the owner of the infamous Candieland plantation. This was vintage Tarantino; violent, bloody, very funny with witty dialogue and entertaining action scenes absurdly gory to the point of laughter. From top to bottom, the acting is this movie is superb to say this least; there isn't a weak performance in the entire film and it's worthy of the awards buzz it's been getting; the acting takes this film to another level. Dicaprio is solid as the repulsive slave owner. Foxx nails the comedic and action parts of his role. However the stand out performances here are Christoff Waltz and Sam Jackson. Is there a better actor right now more perfect for dialogue driven characters than Christoff? I can'think of one. Whether it's Inglorious Basterds, Carnage or this film, there's no question he's one of the best in these kind of roles at the moment. The irony of a German helping Django exact revenge was not lost of me and made his scenes that much more entertaining. And Sam Jackson did what Sam Jackson does; he's nothing short of brilliant in this film as the trusted house slave. He steals every single scene he's in and is hilarious. I really hope there's some awards for both him and Christoff as they are both very deserving. While Kerry Washington role is mostly reserved for screaming, crying or looking pretty (and she does that quite well), she did have a few strong moments as her experiences as a slave will make you skin crawl as she was really convincing in those scenes.Django Unchained is much longer than your typical comedy and does drag on a little. While some scenes could've definitely been tightened or even cut, the pacing was still very good (at no point did I look at my watch or was bored like The Hobbit). I was definitely engaged throughout. The soundtrack was pretty good; it had a good mix of traditional western and modern ballads mixed in.Tarantino's aim for the film seemed to be two fold; first in mocking the incredibly backwards and hateful racism of the era. This is evident in numerous, hilarious scenes: the reaction of every single white person seeing Django on a horse, the Klan having some issues with wardrobe before heading out on a raid and a Django being allowed to stay in the same house as plantations family (this is one of the scenes Jackson steals and may very well be the funniest scene of the year). And secondly, by not beating around the bush and capturing head on the horror of the era so we don't forget. There are scenes that are jolting and very uncomfortable, ala Amistad or Glory. Even though this is mostly a comedy, you do have to prep yourself for some of these scenes as you may not expect them (I didn't). Even with the subject matter, I was surprised by them as I didn't prep myself (so be warned).Kudos to Tarantino for not holding back in this aspect, as uncomfortable as it was, it's important not to trivialize this era and he made sure of that. The film was very interesting in that some times you go from laughing at the absurdity of it in some scenes to feeling the paint of what it was to go through this kind of thing in the very next scene. It's a very thin line between satirical humour and drama with this kind of subject and Tarantino walks it brilliantly. It's pretty clear to me if Tarantino wanted to make a full on slavery era drama (or any pure drama for that matter) he could and it would be profoundly effective; but that's just not his style. With this film and Inglorious Basterds, Tarantino seems to want to right some of histories wrongs in his own gory and humorous way; I'm very excited to see what he comes up with next. So all in all an expertly acted film with great humour that doesn't sugar coat this American era. It's not to be missed and is one of the best movies of 2012.www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob",

It is his first time delving into the Western genre and as usual he succeeds with boldness and brilliance. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, score and acting. The visual landscapes are outstanding. All actors involved deliver superlative performances. In particular DiCaprio, Waltz, Goggins, Foxx, Washington and Jackson are superb. The plot is set pre - Civil War and revolves around a recently freed slave named Django. He is freed, sort of, by a seasoned and cunning bounty hunter named Dr. Schultz. The two initially set out to capture three vicious and murderous brothers and are successful. The duo then continues to hunt bounties throughout the South. Eventually they land at the infamous plantation Candieland. Calvin Candie is a sinister racist that passes his time by holding \"Mandingo Fights\" in which two slaves face off in wrestling matches until the death with betting involved. Once there they find Django's long lost wife Broomhilda which has been Django's goal all along. This is when the cat-n-mouse and war of wills begins to rescue her. Calvin's house slave Stephen overhears a deal negotiated by Schutlz and puts a kibosh on the deal. This results in a duplicitous shootout with two main characters being dispatched. Django is captured, tortured and is removed from Candieland but through some chicanery he convinces the henchmen that are taking him away to return him to Candieland with the offer of great rewards. Once back at Candieland all hell breaks loose as everyone involved learns that Django is not a man to be trifled with. The plot is clever, funny, brutal, violent, unique, cathartic and has a bombastic ending. The film examines the obvious theme of racism. It also explores other themes such as just because Django is freed from his chains is his soul truly free and another is the scrutinizing of greed and power. This is a memorable and captivating film. To this day you'll hear fans of the film quote famous lines such as Django's, \"I like the way you die boy\". It ranks up with Tarantino's best and one of the very best in it's genre.",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino again displays his propensity for cinematic storytelling with Django Unchained, an engrossing and bloody epic that establishes new credentials for Tarentino in the fact that he utilizes a period setting and the fact that he actually tells his story mostly in sequential order, but manages to keep the viewer riveted to the screen completely to an extremely satisfying conclusion.Set in pre-Civil War Texas, the story follows a dentist turned bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) who purchases a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx), ensuring his freedom in exchange for his help in getting to his former employers, who are Schultz' latest bounty. This leads to a partnership where Schultz trains Django in the art of bounty hunting and eventually agrees to help Django retrieve his wife(Kerry Washington), who is still the slave of a wealthy plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is obsessed with Mandingo slaves, slaves who are purchased in order to fight each other to the death purely for the white man's entertainment.In addition to the unaccustomed period setting for Tarantino, this film even took a politically sensitive subject like slavery and put a twist on it by providing an insightful look into the difference between the slave and the black man who wasn't a slave. It was rather unsettling to see Django not really interested in helping the slaves he encounters and the resentment that the slaves seem to have for a black man who is actually free which, sadly, rang true. And even though the film does have a period setting, it does provide the accustomed losers, wannabes, and scumbags that we expect from a Tarantino movie.As always, Tarantino's casting is on the money, led by Waltz, who won his second Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his charismatic and strikingly original King Schultz, Foxx's quiet intensity as the title character and DiCaprio, who has rarely been better in a very unsympathetic role. Mention should also be made of Samuel L. Jackson, who scores as DiCaprio's house man, a character you like one minute and hate the next. All of the actors somehow tap into the tongue in cheek aspect of Tarantino's Oscar winning screenplay in a way that keep the viewer riveted to the screen and not feeling the film's near three- hour length at all.Tarantino's direction is just as compelling as his screenplay. His eye for cinematic carnage is startling...there is some inventive camera work here that includes a unique use of slow motion and the art of the zoom. His offbeat song score simultaneously conjures images of Sergio Leone and Tupac Shakur.Tarantino fans should eat this up and for those who are not, you might want to consider this slightly more traditional story, told with the accustomed Tarantino cinematic panache, that is right up there with Scorsese.",

I don't hate this film for the great acting performances and gripping dialogue which made full use of the chemistry between the characters juggling through their cat-and-mouse mindgames typical of a Tarantino-style.However, I am not convinced that it deserves a nomination this time around. Tarantino must have been trying to outsmart his audience by trying to cover up massive plot holes with chunkful of conversations options 'showing off to the world' how cool this movie is compared to the rest of the action films in the genre. Things I hated are i) the seemingly lazy, recycled material from Inglorious Basterds especially the multi-European language related to Chris Waltz' character. Sorry Tarantino, mixing this with a Cowboy-based setting is just a no-no. ii) The matter of realism was never been taken seriously in any of Tarantino's films which is alright for my review, but to build on a premise of a NON-American travelling with a BLACK on a full suit, weaponry and horse, making themselves so obvious to everyone's attention when they are in the BOUNTY HUNTING business in a ruthless Deadwood era, and manage to outsmart the purportedly stupider local cowboys is beyond preposterous and belittling Tarantino's intelligence or quality towards his trademark. (Even the exaggerated characters made for the alternate reality in Inglorious Basterds had little more sense in their backgrounds) Oh and did i need to mention some of the music scores were off the mark? iii) Dr Schultz killing off random slavers without risked getting a bounty on his own head? Nice try. iv) Django's restraint behaviour even when his loved one is on the verge of 'sent off to N**gger heaven' does not match with Tarantino's aggression style. v) The taunts or threats by the villains are not consistent with a typical Western film, they do too much talking rather than with their guns. vi) A bounty hunter with the skills to hunt down the greatest criminals, came into Candyland with such mediocre preparation is laughable. vii) Why shoot the white girl who defended yours girl in a particular scene?",

Like Brad Pitt, who is great here as the plantation owner who listens to his confidante Stephen, an Uncle Tom character played immensely well by Samuel Jackson, who is almost not recognizable in the role, that's how much he got into the character.The story moseys along well: Waltz (as the bounty-hunter Dr. Schultz) needs Foxx (who plays Django the slave) to identify some targets, and the two strike up a deal: Foxx helps out Waltz collect bodies for money, and Waltz will help him get his enslaved wife back from Pitt. \"Broomhilda von Shaft\" is the name of this German-speaking slavegirl, in some exquisite irony that this film is full of. After all, we're talking Tarantino here.Tarantino serves up plenty of nice spaghetti western touches, from Morricone music, to Franco Nero, and the hyperviolence erupts at just the right times to make you wince, and at the same time think \"I guess there must be a lot more blood splattering around in real gunfights when people get shot in the head than they show in those ordinary western...\"Still, the plot stumbles a bit as it gets into the unexpected twists and turns that Tarantino is so famous for. The first one works pretty well: Waltz finally shoots Pitt rather than shake his hand on a deal that would make all parties happy, such is his disgust for slavery and one of its main perpetrators. The second one is ridiculous, and this film is NOT \"Inglourious Basterds,\" where a huge touch of surrealism works just fine: no slave handlers are going to fork over their weapons to a potentially dangerous slave, no matter how good his plan for making them eleven kilobucks. From there to the ending, the movie devolves into the surreal as in \"Basterds\" or \"Apocalypse Now,\" but unlike those films, it really does not fit well at the end of this period piece western. Yes, Tarantino has a penchant for being over the top, and we love him for it, but it just doesn't quite work here the way it did in \"Basterds\" or \"Kill Bill\" or \"Pulp Fiction.\" This is a western, for crying out loud!So for a somewhat botched last half hour, but still pulling all the stops as deftly as usual, I give this one a 7/10.",

            "content": "I had read four reviews of \"Django Unchained,\" and all of them contained very unflattering or harsh assessments of the film. After watching it today, I wonder if all of us watched the same movie.The first reaction I had was and continues to be this: Tarantino has made a serious movie. The attention to detail is stunning. I wouldn't be surprised if the costumer earned an Oscar.Leonardio DiCaprio is at his very best. And he's playing an elegant creep - or rather, he is someone flourishing in a creepy culture much of which is economically and emotionally accepted - the way the global drug culture is accepted by many today.Christoph Waltz has the toughest role: trying to outdo the part he played in \"Inglorious Basterds.\" In \"Django Unchained,\" however, he serves his dramatic function ably.Jamie Foxx is nearly perfect in his role as Django in a movie that runs on a bit too long, but Tarantino is so good as this sort of speculative revisionist history cum film, that it must be tough to turn the camera off. Foxx's performance is emblematic of much of the cast and the spirit of the film - authentic.I was shocked to see how many capable actors like Bruce Dern have important brief cameos in the movie. Tarantino has assembled quite an effective aesthetic coalition, and, for the most part, this movie works. It makes the culture of slavery come alive in all of its horror, a culture based upon racial hubris. Samuel L. Jackson is also at the very top of his form, exceeding my expectations as a sort of African American slave, Calvin Candie \"Yes man,\" and majordomo of Candie's mansion. DiCaprio's visceral demonstration of phrenology at the dinner table is entirely chilling.At the very least, this film will provoke intense discussion, argument, debate about slavery, segregation, the history of the American South and other cognate topics.I read Tarantino's recent interview in \"Playboy\" Magazine, and I know he is quite concerned about his reputation, his legacy, and, chiefly, about not only keeping the quality of his films up, but, moreover, knowing when to quit. He cites the examples of many other seminal directors who continued to make movies and faded in promise, impact, or aesthetic greatness. Tarantino is only 49 years old. I hope he is not ready to quit, but if he did, this movie would not be a bad way to go out.There is violence in the movie, but I don't feel that it is glamorized. The actual history of violence in 1858 as compared to the violence in this movie is tantamount to comparing a snowstorm to a snowflake. The idea of an African American avenger/savior/fast gun is believably handled, especially when the most powerful themes seem to be liberty, freedom, and love. As a revivionistic view of history, \"Djano Unchained\" is more believable than \"Dances with Wolves.\"I know that some, like Spike Lee, detest this movie. Just as many readers have seen Mark Twain's \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" as a satire of racism, there are others who see it as promulgating racism if only because of the prevalence of the use of the N word. That will probably be the case in \"Django Unchained\" also. Had I grown up the victim of vicious racism, I might very well feel exactly that way.I think \"Django Unchained\" is a well-made movie that takes its themes seriously. The fact that it has commanded so many fine actors and actresses to participate, and the fact that these artists are performing at the top of their form, represents a powerful testimony to the scope, the range and the achievement this movie signifies.Many scenes in \"Inglorious Basterds\" seemed to be throw-away interludes, rather juvenile creations inserted in the form of a gag, a joke. This is not the case with \"Django Unchained.\" I think this movie will serve as the launching pad for discussions about a period of American history that few if any are proud of, but as I think we saw clearly in the recent November elections, the battle for the freedom of women and minorities is far from over. Such battles apparently need to be continually fought and re-fought.",

Foxx is triumphant as the titular hero determined to find his beloved broomhilda. Washington repairs with Foxx as husband and wife after ray and both have an excellent chemistry. DiCaprio gives a career best as the villainous Calvin Candie. He should seek out roles like this more often as it shows a whole new side to his talent. Jackson is fantastic as Candies head of house, the despicable Stephen. I love Jackson as an actor and its nice to be reminded of the type of performance he's capable of. Last but not least is Waltz as the awesomely named Dr King Schultz. Waltz brings to life the German bounty hunter with aplomb. There are so many other minor character moments I could go on for ages.Overall as lovers of cinema we have at hand a modern classic. I honestly believe that in 100 years this film will be enjoyed as a standout of the genre. Tarantino is a film maker having fun (notice broomhilda's surname) which means we get to have fun. The movie certainly is bloody and has liberal doses of the n'word but it never felt gratuitous. It always served the story.Rush out and see this movie.",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's Spaghetti Western-with-a-dash-of-blaxploitation, Django Unchained, is obscurely referential, extremely indulgent, and deliriously over-the-top; in other words it is the kind of shrewd, eyebrow-raising bombast we've come to expect from Tarantino.Set in 1858, the film opens on a foggy, frigid night as a yet-not- unchained Django (a relentlessly convincing Jamie Foxx, giving his character an undercurrent of cold fury) trudges through the woods with a group of fellow slaves. The company encounters Dr. King Schultz (an endearing Christoph Waltz), an unerringly polite and cheerful German-born bounty hunter, who soon enlists Django to help him hunt down a trio of fugitive scumbags, as he is the only one who can reliably identify them. It's only a matter of time before the pair is cutting a bloody trail through slavers, clansmen, and outlaws, as they journey to reunite Django with his wife Broomhilda (an earnest Kerry Washington). He finds her under the oppressive thumb of the smarmy Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio, zealous in his villainy), owner of the lucrative Candyland Plantation. It is here that Waltz and Django plot their most daring ruse, a complex plot to trick Candie into letting them ride off with Broomhilda, with no strings attached. Little do they know, they have an even tougher nut than Candie to crack - his mentoring house slave, Stephen (a bald, almost unrecognizable Samuel Jackson with a creepy, cobra-like menace).This is meant to be Django's tale, as we see him grow from a shackled slave to trained killer to strategic mastermind, but it becomes clear early on that this isn't Django's story \u2013 It is Tarantino's! The godfather of modern gonzo filmmaking addresses American slavery and race relations the same way he has addressed other sensitive issues: by making a boisterously entertaining movie that couldn't be less interested in sensitivity. He wraps the premise of revenge in a cloak of prominent historical injustice, which gives him a certain boundless freedom in adding weight to the payoff of vengeance being served in a manner that is fitting for the antagonists. The film does suffer from a more relaxed style of editing (at 165 minutes) towards the third act, but those are minor quibbles. Django Unchained is a big, sprawling statement that throws everything at the wall and sees what sticks, which has always been one of the strengths of Quentin Tarantino. It is brazen, audacious and thrilling with every concept it dabbles in, and its actors seem to wander through the director's spaces as if consumed by the joyous implications of his overstated enthusiasm for the material, making it engaging on a visceral level.",

            "review_title": "Django Off the Chain. A \"REEL\" Review",
            "content": "Believing all the media talk of excessive violence I went into Django Unchained expecting to see such gratuitous maiming and bloodletting that even for a Tarantino film it would be a new milestone. After seeing the film I wonder if the folks in the entertainment media have ever seen a Tarantino movie? Django is \"chock full of guts 'literally\" but no more so then Kill Bill pt.: 1. To be frank the big deal about the violence in this film was because of the ginormous elephant in the room when America has to face the shady side of its history in talking about slavery. Routinely this subject is skimmed over or swept under the rug as we believe in post racial America *wink* that we are the great big shining city on the hill without blemish. It's an uncomfortable topic for most. Staying true to form, Director Quentin Tarantino is not going to shy away from anything that makes you uncomfortable or squirm in your seat. He is the type of director that is going to take the uncomfortable stuff and throw it right in the audiences face. Django takes the uncomfortable stuff and puts it on display. It wraps it up in a biscuit (no pun intended) to make it go down easier but also making it memorable. This film is harsh in its depictions as it has enough N-Bombs to make any Antebellum South nostalgist feel right at home. I believe the N-bomb was used as a verb, adjective, and noun through out this film and it felt at times that some of the actors themselves had a hard time letting the word loose. Particularly Christophe Waltz who is magnificent in his Role as King Schultz the Dentist/Bounty Hunter. In my opinion that was the most difficult part of the film to get through but staying true to the time period it is the way things were. Especially in the \"Grand Ole\" state of Mississippi. The last time I heard the N-word that much was in the mini series \"ROOTS\". Although I can't say that Django is in the realm of Roots, in modern times I can say that it is an evolution of it with a different ending, As for the violence in the film if you are familiar with the history of slavery then the images portrayed should not come as a shock as in most cases the violence was much worse in reality than what was shown on screen. There were a few moments where \"I said oh my did they really just show that?' but that was in relation to how much flesh one can get away with showing on screen these days. If you can handle that then buckle your seats for the type of ride that only Tarantino can provide. The film is lengthy coming in at almost 2hrs&45 min with trailers but most of the dialog is so well written that you get disappointed when some of the scenes end. The story is simple in that Christophe Waltz plays a bounty Hunter who enlists the help of a slave named Django to assist in bringing in the lucrative bounty of three outlaws. The Rub is that Django can identify the outlaws because he was a slave on the plantation where the outlaws worked as overseers. Django is played by the multi talented Jaime Foxx who executes the role of Django superbly. In exchange for Django's help the bounty hunter agrees to help Django rescue his wife Broom Hilda from Calvin Candie, a Ruthless plantation owner. Broom Hilda is played wonderfully by the beautiful Kerry Washington. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Plantation owner and antagonist Calvin Candie to a twisted level in a role that sees him as the bad guy for a change. He plays this part masterfully. The cast of this film is excellent. Don Johnson and Jonah Hill make cameos so memorable you wish they had more screen time. Last but not least is the role of Stephen played by Samuel L. Jackson the long time Tarantino alum. Stephen is the head of all the house servants and Calvin Candies' most trusted adviser/personal attendant. The role of Stephen is a character so despicable that he may indeed be \"the worse Black man in the History of film\" as said by Samuel L Jackson. He is an \"Uncle Tom archetype who is a scene stealer as his dialog and portrayal by Samuel L. just dominate whenever he is on screen. No one uses the word mother F'er like Mr. Jackson and he does not disappoint. Stephen routinely uses his power to make life hell for the other slaves and is so in need of the master's approval that self-respect and personal pride mean nothing to him. He is truly the master's lap dog. The relationship between Stephen and Django make for some of the most memorable scenes in the film. It's strange experiencing a Tarantino film with so Linear A story line but it's no less exciting than any of his previous films. Django is a risky story to tell sure to anger some and be praised by others. However in the hands of a true craftsman and with noble intention this film shines in its honesty about the state of the world back then and also offers a small spoon of sugar to make the bitter pill go down easier. The true intention of this film comes shining through. Exploitation no. Entertainment and bit of indulgent fantasy yes. Imagine if Kunta Kente grabbed the whip from the overseer, whipped him back and kept his African name. Well that's the kind of world where Django Unchained exists. Django overall is a fantastic film in the same logic as Inglorious Basterds. Revisionist history may prove to be its own genre if it remains so entertaining in the hands of quality directors. 4 Stars. See for yourselfJG",

But this was really the film that's started it Django Unchained is a masterpiece and my second favourite Tarantino movie falling just short of Inglorious Basterds for me. This movie just captures it's period so well to the point where you legitimately feel as if your in the west. Tarantino directs this film masterfully because he tried so many so things here he went for a faster pace and more action sequences and it all works and meshes well together. Jamie Foxx is fantastic in this movie because he acts just how he's supposed to as a real slave would in this situation and as he gradually talks more and acquires more confidence it feels gradual and makes for a greater performance. Christoph Waltz took home his second Oscar for this movie at he absolutely deserved it he's fantastic in this movie and steals every scene he's in almost. Leonardo DiCaprio is fabulous here as well playing the villain so perfectly to the point where I hate him I hate Leonardo DiCaprio that's unimaginable and in my opinion at least deserved an Oscar nomination. Tarantino usually likes to go for more dialogue sequences than action sequences but in Django Unchained he adds in more and it works there all filmed to perfection with intensity and ultimately there just really entertaining. The love story is where the film possibly could falter but know it works perfectly and its what gives the film it's heart and keeps it going. Django Unchained is one of the best westerns I've ever seen and proof that Tarantino can master any genre to create one of his finest movies and one of the best of 2012. 100%-A+",

Perhaps the whole \"mining company\" segment could have been removed, but overall the runtime didn't seem too lengthy. The signature Tarantino style lengthy conversations felt like they fit well in this film too, which i'm glad for, because some of his other films felt like the conversations could have been greatly shortened.

No one knows he is a talented director more than Tarantino itself, which is ultimately his main downfall.Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first: QT makes an appalling cameo, the film is too long for it's own good and there is still a pungent whiff of his gimmicky narrative technique of flicking here there and everywhere. However when putting that aside one could almost surmise that Tarantino has almost, almost, come of age in this film, as the theme of slavery is treated with a definite seriousness, however cursory. To casual onlookers though, this is still Tarantino being a child behind a camera with a rich dictionary of naughty words and bucket loads of blood.What sets this apart from his more recent output is that it has a story, a plot, and it's a welcome return to say the least. Jamie Foxx plays Django, a slave freed by Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) who encourages him to become a bounty hunter, and subsequently claim back his wife from Monsieur Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). All three actors do a terrific job, especially DiCaprio, who suits the nutty-yet-dangerous character of Candie to a tee. Samuel L. Jackson is also worth a mention, as the head slave who is at once hilarious and threatening. What really steals the show is Tarantino's script (nominated for an Academy Award) which is very often hilarious; the audience I was with couldn't stop laughing!It's the most un-Tarantino Tarantino film in a while, while still being, er, a Tarantino film. The plot twists and turns, the set-pieces are terrific and the violence is deliciously graphic, making this into a highly enjoyable film for fans of the director or otherwise.

A puppet president , an undefeatable black hero who defies death in every way , a black sex god stereotype . a hip and cool hustler archetype, an unbeatable black athlete public image. all these are delusions that the real white people behind the scenes feed to the black masses and deceive them that slavery is over and they are OK...

            "content": "The movie is great - I don't like it. But that can be explained. Well - I like Tarantino movies, I adore them even. Bad thing he does not make more of them. Undoubtedly the most successful one so far was Pulp Fiction, it's a cult classic. It just has great actors and a huge number of really classic scenes in it. A famous movie scene has something magical about it. It not only has an impact while it lasts, it also has an impact on the whole movie: Before the scene you kind of look forward to it, then you like it while it happens and then the impression even lasts after the scene. That is the kind of magic that makes you watch movies over and over again thus making it a true cult movie. However human nature has it, that good emotions have a smaller impact on us than bad emotions. You can have the most sensual experience with the most stunning girl - you would not want to have it in exchange for HIV, just the thought of it would turn you off, right? You would not want to have the nicest imaginable sensation on your skin if you had to except the worst imaginable or painful sensation on your skin afterwards. The need to avoid the bad emotion is much more developed than the need to seek the good sensation. And this is not only true for a 1:1 comparison but also for a 1:10 ratio. You could enjoy your favorite most delicious spaghetti a hundred times - but if you bit on huge disgusting cockroach while enjoying our meal just once, you would not only stop enjoying the rest of your spaghetti but would probably condemn the whole place and never come back, no matter if all the previous meals were OK. Now what does that have to do with movies? Well, Tarantino movies are mostly filled with intriguing conversations or impressive violent scenes. Most of them are good and cause a sensation of excitement. You can see that actually by the reaction of the crowd in the movie theater. If a rapist gets struck with a ninja sword or Lucy Liu loses half of her brains in a sword fight or some poor gangster gets shot in the face on the back of a car and his brains splatter all over the place - funny enough everybody, including me, likes these scenes - you can clearly see that in the peoples faces and the sounds they are making: 'ouch!' or 'whohoooo' or 'damn! haha' . And as I said, a good scene not only last while it last, but influences the viewer before, while and after it happens. However, there are scenes, like the baseball bat scene in Inglorious Bastards and the mandingo Scene and the dog scene in Django that do not seem to entertain the audience in the same way. You don't hear an 'ouch!' or 'whohoooo' or 'damn! haha' - what you hear is complete silence! It's like suddenly people are not watching Tarantino anymore but more like everybody is forced to watch a scene from Schindlers List. You are not entertained, not the slightest bit - you are deeply disgusted. That is not what you have come for. You will not look forward to that scene in the future, you will want to avoid it! This scene is not neutral or dull, it is the cockroach in your spaghetti and no mater how good the rest might be, it will have spoiled the whole thing forever. Now how can a cinematic genius as I always like to think of Tarantino, make such a huge mistake? It seems as if he blindly stumbles through a minefield of dreadful ideas for showing violence and was magically able to avoid all mines in Pulp Fiction while treading on one or two mines in the last two movies. Don't get me wrong - those movies might still have very high viewer counts initially, but they will not be seen repeatedly for the above mentioned reason. Which is sad. I liked to think, those mistake are just bad luck, but then I saw an interview with Tarantino the other day. He was talking about violence in Django and he even mentioned that he did show the movie to a test audience and he saw the reaction during the mandingo fight and the dog scene and realized that he had to 'cut the scenes' since they seemed to be too much for the audience. Jesus! You can't help the problem by cutting the scene. Just like cutting a cockroach in half and putting it in the spaghetti wouldn't help the smallest bit. The scenes just have a totally different quality, no matter how much of it you actually show in pictures. Even if you did not show a single picture of the mandingo fight at all and would only have the happenings narrated or hinted at: 'Here we have a man squashing a helpless mans eyes out and then bashing his whimpering, struggling even more helpless skull in with a hammer while the audience is cheering and applauding'. Just knowing that these events take place would cause a bitter silence in every movie theater no matter how much of it was actually shown. I for one don't want to see that again. Why do we perceive certain types of exaggerated violence with excitement while other forms seem to stun and disgust us deeply? In short you could say that the a bad scene is not too violent, but rather violent plus way too mean. Please Mr. Tarantino, go back to the sickness of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill that most people like so much and only some stupid people criticize you for. No more cockroaches in your delicious meals. They destroy the whole thing.",

In fact, I left the theater smiling and laughing at how so beautifully it all wrapped up. Literally the movie goes out with a bang!! Even the black couple that sat next to me were having the time of their lives! I'm proud of Jamie Foxx - it takes some real guts to be involved in a movie set in slavery times - as a freed SLAVE, no less! He played the part perfectly. So did Christoph Waltz as Django's companion Dr. Schulz. This guy stole every scene with a joke or funny line EVERY TIME! I was a bit surprised to find Leonardo DiCaprio playing the part of the villain, but hey, it's Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack from Titanic! His performance reminded me of how Christian Bale was in American Psycho - he let the character freely jump deep into the darkest depths of despicability without holding back ONE BIT! Kerry Washington as Django's wife didn't really have many lines or parts (she was mostly seen as flashbacks and illusions), but with all that she had to work with, she was fantastic! 100% convincing emotions from her, not to mention a BEAUTIFUL smile. :DOh and let's not forget Samuel L. Jackson who was in another one of Tarantino's movies \"Pulp Fiction,\" which is one of IMDb's top 250 movies by the way. He was just like Dr. Schulz - hilarious, and not to mention he took every black stereotype and played them out almost to the point of hilarious absurdity. Ironically, his character was Calvin's assistant, and the head of the other black servants there, and he treated those servants and Django almost as spitefully as Calvin and any other white men did. Don't worry, he got punished for it in the end - BRUTALLY.Yep, not only are the characters fantastic, but also there's a hearty dose of shooting, explosions, and blood - just like a good action movie! Roger Ebert obviously loved this and I can totally understand why. When this comes out to DVD, I'll be the first in line for it!! 10/10",

            "content": "The movie overall is good, but it definitely feels fashioned toward an audience who despises white people and likes seeing them mown down. This is confirmed in the interview with Jamie Foxx in which he says he enjoyed playing a character where he got to kill white people.The movie overlooks the historical fact that 0.01% of the white population of America ever owned slaves, and that the biggest slave owners per capita in the USA during the movie's setting were either Jewish or African-American, but political correctness which Tarantino sadly grew to heavily pander to, doesn't allow criticism of those ethnic groups, especially not in Hollywood.Now with that said, the movie itself is fine, but the opening sequence is agonisingly bloated, overlong, slow, and could have been cut down by two thirds, as we only get to the saloon scene by the 20-23 minute mark, whereas it should have been no later than 10 minutes in.The movie has a lot of good scenes and dialogue, but also a lot of bloat and overly flowery language that actually breaks the fourth wall with its level of pomp.In terms of its rank amongst the other Tarantino movies, I'd put it in the middle, or lower down even. I feel all his best movies were before Inglourious Basterds, as after that one his filmmaking style became a lot more Hollywoodised, and generally dumber.In terms of writing, this movie does have some good stuff, but a lot of eye-roll as well. The movie suffers from the modern Hollywood sickness that has only gotten worse since, that which being the attitude of \"Hey look at our unique progressive story of the first heroic black person\", as if they're patting themselves on the back for thinking they're the first filmmakers to have black heroes or whatever, forgetting the decades of movies that preceded it which had black heroes and did it better, and not so on the nose like Tarantino is doing here. You could even say that the movie is racist to black people in how it babies them so much, and even presents them as having lower intelligence.Overall it seems that the message of MLK Jr. Has been completely ignored by a large proportion of America, as people see themselves and others racially more now than they did in the 90s. The fact that such a racially inflaming movie as Django Unchained is so popular, speaks volumes to how far we as a society are from MLK's vision of race or skin colour not being an issue.",

Kinda like people who thought P.T.Anderson's \"The Master\" was boring or confusing; those individuals need to expect something different from the main stream.At any rate, DJANGO's plot is pretty simplistic and not overly complicated. Most scenes you don't have to concentrate on the actual movement of the story, yet the dialog (very QT'esque) is BRILLIANT. The comedy, and subtle one-liners vastly offset the retro-throw-back super cheese Spght.Western violence, which is meant to be \"campy.\" As far as acting, wow, everyone is on top of their game. Too include, Jonah Hill, who has one of the best cameos in a long time. The whole \"KKK\" scene, is HILARIOUS!!! I went with my brother, sister and her husband and we all were LOAO.

The story takes place in the great economic depression period where the majority of people were unable to meet the minimum standard of living. How can I relate this novel to \"Django Unchained?\" Both show a cruel background of segregation that African American experienced as well as the history of prejudices and racism.The movie takes place in 2 years before Civil war transpires, 1885. So it might be hard for young generation to understand some of the articulations, but they are still comprehensive and well written. There are vibrant and nerve-wrecking battle scenes where you find a protagonist being on thin ice a lot. The music is well composed and used in a timely fashion.Django who is not afraid to show anything to appeal his bravery and arrogance towards enemies is top-notch. Jamie Foxx goes beyond his limit by suavely executing a role of such an uneducated slave. Christoph Waltz does his part by unleashing his prowess and people skill. His character, Dr. King Schultz is the one who does most of talking while also speaking fluent German. The way he connives shows that words can be sharper than the swords.Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Calvin Candie, a notorious owner of the \"Candyland\" which is a luxurious house fraught with slaves who merely exist to serve him proves that he can harness any type of roles flawlessly. What a royal antagonist he is. Of course, they are not the only contributors that provide an excellence and realism to the movie. An amazing acting done by a group of cameos is what make this movie believable. From the emotion to the behavior, it sublimely evokes the surreal situation from the year 1885. As this movie contains a number of restricted languages and bloody actions, it might not be suitable for those who may easily feel offended or terrified. However, it ain't like any other movies that are just packed with full of meaningless fighting scenes. It is about recapturing and embracing remorseful history that may be still recurring somewhere in the world.",

First of all, if you want to do such a movie, almost 3 hours is way too long...Tarantino is only doing homage movies, just more and more badly each time... This one is supposed to be a Sergio Leone homage, but it's more like a parody : Scary Movie in the far-west or something. There's not an inch of depth in this film. There's not an ounce of script. A black slave liberated by a bounty hunter, and then they want to save the black man's wife. That's it. The rest is just gunfire, explosions, and boring dialogs. Sergio Leone's movies had depth : depth of character, depth of landscape, a well written script, and you weren't bored.Django is hip, and that's why it gets such a (ridiculous) high score on IMDb. Blood everywhere, snappy lines, hip hop music, bad guys killed, good guys winning... At no point in the movie does this feel like a story (real or not). You can clearly see the actors don't believe in it, and are just having fun. Di Caprio is probably the worst, totally out of place as a Southern plantation owner. The violence is extremely gratuitous, and the \"harsh\" scenes where good guy get tortured/killed have absolutely no dramatic effect whatsoever. Again, it just feels wrong, out of place, and even offensive, turning the history of slavery into a joke.Tarantino should just stop making movies for fun, and should start by letting other people write his scripts...

If U haven't seen this genre before, you'll say it's a very good movie, but for me, nothing new here. Nothing of great significance here except the music and a handful of scenes.As for the scenario, it was a shallow one, not like what i expected from Tarantino as he always pushed the envelope too far in his perspective regarding the themes he presents in his movies (e.g. Inglourious Basterds) and which is a characteristic of QT that made him distinctive, and sure not an Oscar-worth-nomination scenario. As for Performances (which was the second element that disappointed me), no one gave a captivating performance except, and to my surprise, Samuel L. Jackson, which did a fine supporting role deserves recognition, Jamie Foxx wasn't the suitable lead, he didn't give a performance to engage the viewer with his story as the black hero trying to free himself and his wife from slavery; Waltz gave a weaker performance that his previous effort in Inglourious Basterds, DiCaprio did a good job but not what i expected from what i saw in the trailers due to his one dimensional character, the only role that took my attention was Samuel L. Jackson as Steven the Butler. Tarantino made an appearance which is the worst I've ever seen. What i said earlier concerning the scenario, can be said for direction; the movie lacked Tarantino's special view in direction which we usually see in his movies, even the camera work wasn't that special.

The Italians made back in time some very good western, the best of them is still \"The good, the bad and the ugly\".",

I truly LIKE his movies and enjoy them but I'm no 'Tarantino Scholar' proclaiming the virtues of every scene and line of every movie. I went into Django Unchained expecting to be entertained but I did not expect anything earth-jarring.Boy was I wrong. I feel like this movie is the ultimate expression of Tarantino's 'F*#k you Hollywood' style of film making. This movie doesn't have proper structure, flow, editing, or even make a whole lot of sense. It's simply pure hilarious creative pleasure! I laughed harder than I have in years, to the point I had tears in my eyes. I was never bored for a minute. If the point of a movie is to ENTERTAIN than this is one of the best movies ever made. I'll skip the commentary on performances beyond this : Christoph Waltz is a genius, Samuel L. Jackson has never been so entertaining, Jamie Foxx has never been so watchable, and Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the most talented and Chameleon like actors in history. You will never look at your watch during the epic running time. I could have sat through another hour of this easily. There has been some controversy regarding the language and topic of the movie but I say good on Tarantino and his cast of talented black people for going beyond this ridiculous self-imposed censorship society has put upon the topic of the history of slavery. We satirically make light of all kinds of tragic historical times. We insert comedy into almost every movie about every war to great effect...and that's what slavery in the USA was: a war. A war about decency vs. indecency. I like that this movie reminded me how horrible this scar on the history of the world truly is. Don't bury the past, remind us of the past and give us the pleasure of a few stories about the horrors where the beaten beat the beaters if you know what I mean. I rate this 10/10. I didn't learn anything new, I didn't find anything profound, I don't think this movie will change the world. It's pure unadulterated over the top ENTERTAINMENT.",

Jamie Foxx does all that it's required from him in the main role with a great, Oscar winning, performance from Christoph Waltz who can be charming, funny, and charismatic all in a role that you don't necessarily root for in the beginning. Their chemistry is what drives this movie and it does it rather well. The cinematography here is top notch and Tarantino proves he's probably the director that most wisely chooses songs for his movies... What takes this movie in my opinion to epic status is Leo's surprising role as a villain who most couldn't see Dicaprio do...but he excels in this role. Overall is a movie that doesn't bore you for one minute and it's part of my personal favorites!!",

A strong bond is formed between the wise, quick-witted and optimistic bounty hunter and Django, who Schultz has trained to be a one-man army in Quentin Tarantion's latest film, Django Unchained. You can't help but hope that the film never ends during it's first hour which is played like a Western, with equal amounts of blood, shocks and laughs. Though, half way through, the film changes pace when Leonardo DiCaprio is introduced as Calvin Candie. Candie is the owner of Candyland, the most notorious plantation in all Mississippi, where Django's wife is being held. The fun stops here and things get deadly serious. Samuel L. Jackson joins in only to make things more intense in his strongest role yet. One has to admire having four actors at the peek of their careers all sitting around a table sharing a meal, even if it may be in the most uncomfortable and stomach-churning scenes ever put to film.Django falls back between Kill Bill & Tarantio's magnum opus, Inglourious Basterds. While Basterds seems to have been flawlessly written with everything perfectly planed out and in place, Django feels as if much of the film was improvised. Christoph Waltz was never been better and completely steals the show. The action lives up to what we've come to expect from Tarantino and though the dialogue is still better written and acted than anything else out there, it doesn't top anything Tarantino has done before.As a Western, it's as good as they get. Like Kill Bill, when you leave the theatre you are satisfied and have seen enough. However, I find the greatest films are the ones that leave you craving more.

Jackson. You may remember Waltz's performance in Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds' where he was absolutely fantastic and fully deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. Unfortunately, I don't quite understand why he has been nominated now; although his performance is good and he is very funny, I think it is appalling that Leonardo DiCaprio has no Oscar nod \u2013 his character is horrible, cruel, and evil and he plays it perfectly! He makes you shudder sometimes with his callousness and makes you laugh at his stupidity. Samuel L. Jackson is great here; I've never seen him do a role like this but he was brilliant and I'm a bit disappointed that he hasn't received any awards recognition here either. One performance that wasn't up to scratch was that of Tarantino himself; with a small role as an Australian (I think). He does redeem himself a little with his grand exit but I think he should stick to playing corpses next time. A major problem with this film is its length; this is where 'Django Unchained' fails the most. There are several points where you think scenes should have been cut just because they don't really play a huge part in the overall story. The dialogue is genius and it is a real pleasure to listen to it because it is so well written. The action sequences are so well choreographed (as always) and are really funny at some points and genuinely horrifying at others. The issue of slavery is dealt with in a very professional way here; at no point does Tarantino attempt to glamorise or romanticise the slave trade and the slaves themselves. He does a great job of showing slavery in its true horror and portrays the ghastly nature of some people during those times. I cannot think of any other film which has dealt with this issue in such a way but I'm really pleased someone finally showed how awful it was. The story overall is interesting but it doesn't run very smoothly because there are at least two moments where you think the film will end but it doesn't and you begin to get a little bit exacerbated at how long it is.Overall, this is a great film but it is far too long. I absolutely love Quentin Tarantino and he has done a great job here but a lot more should have been cut. It is a brilliantly funny and powerful film that is just a little bit cluttered.",

The main character is just so unlikeable you would like to vomit.The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of just 1, is that the film does give an interesting glimpse of the Southern Dixie life of the 19th century, with the plantations, slaves and their masters, towns and other living conditions, the culture and habits of the time, the racial (and economical) classes, and the general way of living in that period (to the extent it can be seen reliable).

Right off the bat there wasn't anything particularly interesting or stand-out about the plot. I mean, it's revenge, which isn't exactly something original (*ahem* Kill Bill) but unlike Kill Bill, the plot wasn't particularly interesting and most of the jokes fell flat. The ending was satisfying as hell, but the long and winding build up to it dissipated any satisfaction I might have felt.Alright, the acting is good, and it was kind of funny in the first half, but honestly the brutality and graphic-ness of it all wasn't handled as tastefully as Tarantino's earlier works and I think at one point everyone just went \"right, how can we not only torture the actors, but also torture the people who took it upon themselves to sit through this two-and-a-half hour travesty\".One major turn-off is the sheer concentration fo racial slurs. I know that this was the 18th century or whatever, when it was still normalised, but there are so many great movies set at the same time which don't resort to using that slur 20 times per sentence. Also, Tarantino is white. Do I really have to explain why that's a problem?Watch Kill Bill instead.-Sasha.",

I couldn't decide between Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained. Django Unchained has some stuff that I haven't seen from Tarantino. Such as a moving love story. It didn't have that dark and gritty feel Basterds had, but instead had a lighter heart of a movie at times. Such as teaching Django how to be a bounty hunter or the \"Bag\" Scene. It felt like a 60's western at times which made it great. The performances were outstanding which my favorite being from Christoph Waltz, while Samuel L Jackson and Leonardo DiCaprio were also very good. A lot of great lines in this movie such as \"the D is silent\" or \"if you insist\" or \"I couldn't help myself\". Jaimie Foxx was great also playing the perfect Django.There were great cameos too. The movie had a lot of great directorial shots such as showing the foam being taken off the top of the beer showing Quentin's true vision which is so magnificent. The scene with The Candy-land Shooting was my favorite because of the suspense and action. Matches up to the Bar Mexican shootout in Inglourious and in my opinion better and bloodier. I think this movie will do great at the Oscars, maybe winning best picture because of the Zero Dark Thirty. I think the best supporting actor Oscar should go to Christoph Waltz personally(then for both of the Tarantino movies hes in he would have an Oscar). But I wouldn't mind if Leo won because I have never seen him act like this before, its not his best performance but maybe my favorite character of his, showing off his true acting talent. The movie is so exciting and entertaining and really made you feel like you were with Django following him on his epic journey. You must see this movie before I spoil anymore. This movie deserves to be on the top 250 inside the top 125. It was truly a privilege seeing this movie.",

In Django the violence seems to be sloppily thrown in to add the shock value that Tarantino is known for. Tarantino is also known for his exaggerated characterization of different social/ethnic groups...which is another quality I enjoy about his films. But in Django he is so off the mark that it is despicable and I can not believe such great actors would agree to play these roles.Like I said before I adore Tarantino movies, and I like the premise of Django.

Would you want to?Less than a decade before the Civil War, Django (a slave portrayed by Jamie Foxx) is being escorted, in chains, by his masters, the Speck brothers. They are traveling through a remote, wooded area when they encounter someone unexpected. Their unexpected company is former dentist, Dr. King Schultz. Schultz (portrayed by Christoph Waltz) is looking for a slave formerly owned by men he wishes to find. The slave, it turns out, is Django. The Specks have no intention of surrendering Django to the doctor and make that point very clear. The doctor then kills one Speck brother and leaves the other alive but seriously wounded. Schultz (Waltz) then informs Django that if he can identify the men he's searching for, whom Schultz is hunting in hopes of securing a bounty, and aid in their capture, Schultz will grant Django his freedom and give him $75 and a horse. Schultz also reveals that he despises slavery as a concept. Once the men Schultz was after are found and dealt with, Schultz tells Django that, as he has never given anyone their freedom before, he feels a certain responsibility. The two men become colleagues, hunting fugitives for money. In addition, the former dentist offers to help Django find the one thing he really wants: his wife Broomhilda. Broomhilda (also a slave, portrayed by Kerry Washington) was named by her original owners who were German, like Schultz. She was left scarred by her owners, who were also Django's, and then the two were auctioned separately. After a few inquiries, they learn that Broomhilda is now in the possession of well-known plantation owner and Francophile Calvin Candie and residing with Candie on the plantation counter-intuitively referred to as Candie Land.While some people worship Tarantino's body of work, generally speaking, I can take it or leave it. I didn't like Pulp Fiction, or Reservoir Dogs, thought Inglorious Basterds was decent but overrated, but loved Jackie Brown. Jamie Foxx, on the other hand, has proved his skill time and time and again and, while not every film he's appeared in could be considered quality, the fault rarely, if ever, lies with him. As for Waltz, it is refreshing to see him portray a character with redeeming qualities and he does so very well. DiCaprio, contrastingly, tends to play characters that are, or are at least meant to be, likable. Despite being well-mannered, Calvin Candie is anything but. Even so, his performance is masterful. Critics who dislike this film have come at it from both sides. Some take issue with the film for not depicting slavery seriously. Others see the depiction of Caucasians as villains as the continuation of some sort of disturbing trend. Of course, the fact that Christoph Waltz portrays one of the protagonists would seem to contradict that but, why let logic interfere with an argument? As for what I think, those who suffer typically deserve it and slave masters are shown as vicious because, more often than not, they were. I liked this film and I can't imagine why those who can see this film with an apolitical eye wouldn't.",

I think his best stuff was probably Reservoir Dogs and Inglorious Bastards myself. I found Inglorious to have much more engaging characters and just be much more interesting and compelling. Django felt like a canvas for wanton violence like usual. Not to say Inglorious didn't have it's own level of wanton violence but at least things seemed a bit more justified here and there. My issues with the film aside the acting was wonderful. Everyone really invested in their roles and made them their own. Leo was a bit campy and not really convincing and Samuel L Jackson was his usual moronic self. The less we see of him the better in films. I haven't seen anything good from him since Unbreakable. Christopher Waltz, for me at least, really runs the show. He lends such brilliance to his polite bounty hunter. And it's even a somewhat comical role as well given the different scenarios. So I definitely enjoyed his character best.As far as plot...what plot you could say. It's pretty much a basic revenge film with some twists. The film jumped around a bit as Tarantino films usually do. There were of course several scenes or sub plots that were entirely unnecessary but Tarantino had a few buckets of blood left that were being unused so he thought, \"Heck, let's add this scene and have him kill a few more people.\" I think my favorite tangent was Don Johnson as a plantation owner and a KKK founder. His role, and the sequences thereafter were rather amusing. In general though I felt like the film took WAY TOO LONG to get to the end. We all knew what would happen pretty much from the start. It just took Tarantino nearly hours to get there with what he thought were good \"twists\". Ultimately if you like Tarantino films you probably won't be disappointed. Myself I'm a cautious fan of parts of his work but I generally am not impressed since it always feels like a lot of grand standing and look at me kind of crap. I heard this one was his \"best\" so I was curious. Not to mention the cast and theme warranted at least one viewing. But sadly I came away disappointed with a few gem scenes and the rest pretty much Tarantino tripe.",

Right from the beginning - This story has you hooked.Typical Tarantino dialog between characters and lots of his famous blood splattering throughout to punctuate the story dramatically.I don't want to spoil the story here - So i won't. Let's just call it a typical western(Sorry Quentin - Make that a Southern)mixed with copious amounts of Tarrantino magic. Think \"Pulp Fiction\" with horses and saddle sores.I love Tarantino's Aussie accent when he's playing along side Australian actor John Jarratt. Samuel L. Jackson once again steals his scenes with an intensity that scares you. I was blown away by Trinity's song being included at the end. I'm so pleased Tarantino shares my love of those old \"Trinity\" movies...Great cast. Great story. Masterfully directed with a superb soundtrack... \"Django Unchained\" will fulfill you cravings for Tarantino escapism. Great work Quentin - 10/10.Cheers Mark P.",

Of course, as befits Tarantino's scenarios, there was also bloodshed, but it wasn't as brutal as his previous productions. I consider this a definite asset of this movie.

            "content": "I rarely write reviews but must admit this one compelled me to take up the task as the movie left an impressionable print on my mind. This is not only Tarantino's greatest work, but I'd rate it is as the best of 2012 and I'd be very surprised if this movie does not make it to Oscar nominations due out on Jan 10, 2013.Let me begin with the performances. Christopher Waltz's performance is such that it is difficult to distinguish between his character and his real persona - he looks the role more than any actor has managed to look in recent memory. I wonder if Tarantino even had to direct Waltz much at all during the shooting since Waltz's craft appears to be supreme as he progresses from scene to scene with rare aplomb and with a highly charismatic screen presence. Leonardo DiCaprio as a Southerner delivers another solid performance that we have come to expect out of him. There is no doubt that DiCaprio will establish his name amongst Hollywood's greats and Django Unchained will be spoken about richly in any discussion of his legacy. Finally, Jamie Fox. Not the one to trail behind either Waltz or DiCaprio in terms of performance, Fox grows in his role and delivers the punch towards the end as Django and totally owns the climax. Since the movie revolves around his character, he has ample opportunity to showcase his talent and surely does not disappoint.However all the aforementioned fine performances are rooted in a strong screenplay and direction. Tarantino's treatment in his movies is famous and familiar which has got him millions of fans around the world, but Django Unchained is his finest writing yet and he will attract additional fans due to the superb script of the movie. It is a monumental task to keep one glued to the proceedings for 2 hours and 45 minutes, but the screenplay is so tight that you're kept on the edge of your seats throughout and there is no realization of the lengthiness of the movie at any time during watching the movie. The locations of the movie, especially of the southern plantations are superb, and keep the feel of the movie fresh and very engaging. The dialogues are very witty and do justice to the time depicted by the movie. Many viewers feel that there is excessive use of the N word in the movie, however I found complete originality in the use of the word however frequent it was and ensured that the flavor of the time is impressed upon the viewer. Of course, we have no place for such a word in our society today but Tarantino does not shy away from using it often in the movie because of the period the movie is set in.I did not go into the movie with any expectations from it other than being thoroughly entertained. Although the movie totally lived up to my expectation and much more, it taught me a few things about the dark era of slavery. I feel historically enriched and better understand the plight of the slaves, and feel so proud that the nation chose to face a civil war than continue such barbaric practices.To Mr. Tarantino: you already are the Oscar winner for this movie in my eyes. For Best Film. For Best Direction. And for the Best Original Screenplay. I don't think anything else comes close yet in 2012. And even if you get none of the awards because our scholarly friends at the Academy chose Lincoln or some another work, be rest assured that we fans are glad we had Django to closeout 2012 with a bang and on a very high note ! Thank you and look forward to seeing more of you more often.",

While it's not a film that's 100 percent accurate in its historical accounts and it might contain a few anachronisms here and there for the super nerds out there trying to spot them out, the movie is still enjoyable from beginning to end.Jamie Foxx, as the lead character, delivers a strong, solid performance as Django, a recently freed slave, with lots of heart and a quick learner, who is out for revenge after a gang of hillbilly criminals snatched his beloved wife, tortured her and sold her to a different slave owner. Christoph Waltz, gives an unforgettable performance as King Schultz, a German bounty hunter and former dentist who partners up with Django and later assists him on his quest for vengeance. Waltz steals the show in every scene he is in, with his witty, sharp dialogue and incomparable comic timing and delivery. Leonardo DiCaprio, as the main villain Calvin Candie, gives another mesmerizing performance to add to his long resume as a cruel and racist plantation magnate. Kerry Washington also delivers as the beautiful, bilingual wife of Django, Broomhilda Von Shaft, a constant victim of humiliation and cruelty by her owner, Calvin Candie. Samuel L. Jackson gives another memorable performance to add to his very own Tarantino resume as Stephen, an outspoken and powerful house slave who is very sharp and observant and who instantly despises Django upon meeting him.There are also other names and familiar faces you will see on this film that also give good supporting performances such as Don Johnson, James Remar (playing two characters) Tom Wopat, M.C. Gainey, Jonah Hill, Michael Parks, among others. Even Tarantino himself makes a small cameo. The movie is filled with the classic Tarantino brand of superb dialogue, bloody scenes, hilarious random conversations, etc. It's everything you go to the movies for. If you want an accurate historical account of the slavery era, you will not get it from \"Django\" what you will get is what you pay for, A Tarantino masterpiece full of what he does best, make great, intelligent and wildly entertaining films!

First, I must start off by saying Christoph Waltz was ROBBED on multiple levels. He should have been nominated in the Best Actor category. He made this movie his own. But, when you are up against Daniel Day-Lewis (also an excellent actor) who is back from sabbatical, \"they\" had to put Waltz in the supporting category to ensure a win for both men. Lincoln was an alright film, but its the type of movie I would rather see in school. When Waltz (or his horse) first appear, I immediately thought, Colonel Landa was back (his role from another Tarantino film) and Waltz would be playing another wonderful villain. He fooled us and became our (gulp) hero. Jamie Foxx was excellent and continues to grow as dramatic actor. I like Kerry Washington. I liked her role in the film but I felt it could have been played by any unknown actress. This is NOT to take away from Washington's training and talent, but with her tenure in the industry, she needs to be doing more challenging roles, and she will.Leo, Leo, Leo. What was that??? This is probably one of his best roles to date. It was refreshing not to see him as a troubled soul or playing a historical character in history. He, along with Samuel L. Jackson (another Tarantino alum), should have received Oscar nominations for the supporting actor category. l lost a bet.People (ahem, Spike Lee, whom I admire) have complained about the \"massive\" use of the n- word, violence, etc. Hello??? This is a film set in the South. In Mississippi. During Slavery. Enough said, right? I don't think there is any way to soften this type of film which would be an insult.

He has chosen this time to revitalise the genre of second division spaghetti westerns but this is less about that and more about slavery.In terms of the movie itself there is so much to applaud here . For a start the cinematography is some of the best i have seen in recent times. Flawless. Great dialogue too (which has always been a Tarantino trademark). Jamie Foxx is good but he generally just has to look and act mean. The performances by Waltz and Di Caprio are outstanding. Full marks to the director for at last giving us something to admire from Di Caprio - by making him emote. The only two negatives for me which contrasted with the attention to detail applied elsewhere were the dreadful bursts of contemporary music every 20 - 30 minutes.

It is also one of the best Westerns I have ever seen, only behind Leone's \"The Good the Bad and the Ugly\" and Peckinpah's \"The Wild Bunch\". It heavily borrows from the work's of Mr. Leone, and much like Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\", is largely a homage to his directorial style. Let me address some of the major complaints I've heard about this movie. I've heard that the movie is racist because of its heavy use of the n-word. I will not say the movie doesn't use it a lot, but this is a movie that takes place in 19th century Southern America. You don't have to be a history professor to know that this was not a kind place or time for African-Americans. Another complaint is the film's historical inaccuracy. And, while the film makes several anachronistic errors, it is important to remember that this is very much an exploitation movie. If a movie like Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\", a very serious film about World War 2, makes a mistake of this nature, then I see a point in pointing it out. But why, in a movie about a slave becoming a bounty hunter, is that important? And the only complaint I really had was the lack of clever dialog. There were many quotable one-liners, but there was a lack of the quirky and delightful conversations that Mr. Tarantino is famous for. Now the numerous things I liked about \"Django Unchained.\" The movie borrows heavily from Sergio Leone, enough that I wish Mr. Leone was still alive so I could hear his opinion of it. It was well shot, but a scene that stood out was the final gunfight in Candyland. This was one of my favorite movie shootouts ever. The soundtrack is also incredible- there's some Ennio Morricone, a great opening song, Jim Croce, and even a James Brown/ 2pac mashup! The acting was great, but the two stand-out performances, to me, were those of Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. DiCaprio plays a fantastically over the top villain that reminds me of Dennis Hopper in \"Blue Velvet\", or Gary Oldman in \"The Professional\". Sam Jackson plays a house slave that is an interesting and unlikeable character. I particularly liked that Jackson did a role that seemed very much unlike him. This movie already picked up some Golden Globes, and with the Oscars not too far in the future, we are left to wonder how \"Django\" will fair. I can only hope for the best, but I believe the Oscar crowd will once again be afraid to give a daring movie such as this one the recognition it deserves.",

An instant classic and a highlight for his career, Django unchains itself from comparison to any other film, it's magnificent characters, astonishingly detailed writing and moments of shock are so out there. Christoph Waltz can do no wrong, he is an actor with talent through the roof, and his latest performance as Dr. King Schultz catapults him further to one of the beat actors status, yes I am a fan. Same goes to Jamie Foxx, he plays vulnerable and unsure to start with yet as he gets closer to the end of his revenge journey as Django, he becomes confident and flamboyant, Foxx is impeccable here. Leonardo DiCaprio is almost unrecognisable in terms of behaviour and attitude, he is superb as a nasty piece of work Calvin Candy, a slave ranch owner. Samuel L Jackson, Walton Goggins and Kerry Washington add more star power to this marvel of a movie, Tarantino's writing and characters here at what drive this adventure, yet the intensity and horror of slavery also has strong authority on screen amongst the stars, as well as some exciting moments of action and well staged gun fights. This western themed revenge tale dowses the genre in signature Tarantino fire igniting a 165 minute masterpiece.",

Christoph Schultz delivers another earth-shattering performance as well as his co-star Jamie Foxx. Of course, DiCaprio delivered a solid performance so realistic that, at times, it seemed all to real and could be frightening (in a good way) to some viewers. Apparently there was controversy over Tarantino's decision to have the \"N\" word spoken so many times throughout the film. This baffles me as I wonder what one would expect to hear during times of slavery and severe inequality. What, you want to hide the fact that it ever happened? Are you embarrassed that this is the tragic reality of our country? Whatever the case may be, the use of the \"N\" word in this movie should not be a debated so much as it takes away from the more important messages of the film. Then again, Tarantino has stated that he was glad there was so much controversy over it since it caused a national dialogue about slavery different than any before. I loved the fact that there were a few sub-plots withing the main plot. Each character was important. There was no room for tedious objects to be added nor was there any reason to given the substance of Django Unchained. The movie, like all of Tarantino's movies, is pretty dang violent. It's probably just shy of being his most violent film as I believe Inglourious Bastards to be number one. The emotion in Django Unchained is so strong it's almost palpable. I found my muscles tensing up several times. By the end of the movie I extremely moved and touched by Quentin's genius. This is truly a must-see film of the 21st century.",

            "content": "Oscar made me do it. Yep. The only reason I sat through two hours and forty-five minutes of a Tarantino Western was because I knew this film was going to get Oscar nominations and thus, I was obliged to see it. But I hate Westerns and I am not a fan of Tarantino, so I knew this could be a tough ride.I was partially right.This long, drawn-out story of slavery revenge most certainly had its moments...the problem is that it takes far too many minutes to get through them all.The story is simple enough. Jamie Foxx, in an excellent performance, plays Django, a slave separated from his wife and sold off to a plantation two years before the civil war. While being transported, the caravan is intercepted by Dr. King Schultz, played to perfection (again) by the incomparable Christophe Waltz, who knows Django knows what the three men he needs to kill look like, and thus \"buys\" his freedom. In exchange for helping him track his bounty, Schultz indeed offers Django his freedom. However, when he learns the story of Django being separated from his wife...and sees Django's marksmanship... Shultz offers to help Django find his wife if he helps Shultz kill all the men on his bounty list. With the promise of freedom, money AND his wife, how could Django refuse? In theory, \"Django Unchained\" has all the elements of a truly great film...and that says a lot coming from a Western-hating, non-Tarantino fan. The story is great. Foxx is great, but Waltz is utterly fantastic...and will be looking at yet another Oscar nomination. Kerry Washington, as Django's wife Broomhilda, proves that she is not only unequivocally stunning to watch but an absolutely exceptional actress. Hell, even Leonardo Dicaprio, as Broomhilda's owner, turns an excellent performance that is worthy of an Oscar nomination if he so gets it. Need I even mention that Samuel L. Jackson is perfection? And then there's Don Johnson! Yes! Don Johnson!!! So, pair all these great performances with a great script, loads of violence, two scenes that even made ME squint and squirm, along with beautiful art direction, costumes, cinematography and the controversial overuse of a certain word which actually manages to desensitize you to its utterance, this must be a pretty awesome film, no? Not entirely.It lacks one key ingredient: evidence of an EDITOR. With a running time of two hours and forty-five minutes, this film managed to run way too long. I mean, way too long. This film could have easily been tightened up to run at a smoother, quicker pace and shave off at least thirty minutes. But certain scenes seemed to needlessly drag on, leaving a film which has so many good elements but leaves you mindful of the time as you begin to shift in your seat, your buns going numb. Although \"Inglorious Basterds,\" arguably Tarantino's best film, had a scene or two that ran longer than they needed to, I don't remember shifting in my seat nearly as much. What could have been one of the best films of the year merely took far too long to get to the point. But hey, it didn't bore me, so I give Tarantino credit for making potentially the least tedious Western I have ever endured.",

This is the first movie i've seen him in direction so I would love to see and check out his other movies as well.The characters were the most darkest and the most different characters that I've never seen in other movies .Jamie Foxx - Django Freeman - A slave who is purchased in Kind of a way by Dr. King Schultz after he hears he knows something about Brittle Brothers and Schultz wants to kill them . He said he knows them without knowing , Schultz kills the Speck Brothers who were carrying these slaves in the middle of them Django and releases Django by telling him you get me them and I will get you your freedom . They agree Schultz teaches Django everything he knows makes him partner and tells him this winter come with me as bounty haunters make some money and you'll get your wife back who she was sold to other owners and you will be together again with her . A very breakthrough character who is tough , dark , brave , hurt and I don't think anybody would play it better than J-Foxx .Christoph Waltz - Dr. King Schultz - a very quiet character but also has a killing side , he's a bounty haunter which takes warrant to kill people and instead get rewards for it . Loved his performance was great and I think it was a big development character in this movie .Leonardo DiCaprio - Monsieur Calvin J. Candie - It surprised me that Leonardo DiCaprio took the guts and played a opposite side by acting the bad guy and it really showed up his acting skills like never before . This dark , insulting , proudest , gentleman , crazy character played by him a rich man who likes entertainment gladiators and is a very gentleman but at the same time very the opposite of it . One of the biggest impacts on this film .Samuel L. Jackson - Stephen - This jackass waiter who notices everything and is very observant who finds out that Broomhilda and Django are husband and wife . The first film that I've seen Samuel in and wasn't that bad had a great performance where it showed really a person you can hate .The last thing in the movie after all actions , drama-s , romances I loved was that Candie , Schultz is dead and Django after being sent to work some place he manages to manipulate the bandits kill them and comes back where he kills everybody especially Stephen and takes back his wife and walk away .A very brief story talking about racism , the slaves being a humiliated race because of their color and a man 1 in 10 thousand steps up and shows them who the f*** they are :D There's not enough words I can describe how much this movie is so awesome who hasn't checked it you should because it is a MASTERPIECE !",

Jamie Foxx as Django was a phenomenal choice by the casting director. Di Caprio's performance is one of his best to date. Not to mention Christoph Waltz as a loving yet smart bounty hunter posing as a dentist. Although Samuel.L.Jackson's Character has a less than optimal in movie counterpart, He makes the audience further immerse themselves into the American south during the year 1858. This story builds on the American tragedy that is slavery.This film has something for everyone, Packed fight scenes with a lot of blood and gore, to the loving and calm conversations between long separated lovers.

I can't quite believe that Waltz could get himself into so many scrapes and talk his way out of it, it belongs in a more outrageous, funnier film. In a way, I think Quentin is too influenced by those slightly silly 1970s films where anything goes, and it doesn't really fit here. He is mixing his genres, though when it turns slapstick with the Ku Klux Klan, well, that could be out of Blazing Saddles. I don't mind, it's funny enough, but it's a thin line.I'm not sure Foxx as Django is quite charismatic enough, so Waltz is carrying the movie a lot, a bit of a problem. DiCaprio puts in the best acting performance I've seen as the plantation owner, but he doesn't quite have the stature or prescence to pull off what would have been a plum role for Larry Hagman or Orson Welles in their younger days.The final 20 minutes goes off the rails and becomes pure fantasy, much like the ending of Inglorious...

The actor who plays Dr. Schulz also conveys the transition from bounty hunter looking for information to mentor/parter to person who cares about what happens to Django realistically and authentically. Another reviewer mentioned the cameos of familiar faces negatively but I found them extremely enjoyable. I've heard and read the words \"slave revenge fantasy\" thrown around in reference to the movie and also read that this movie dishonors African American ancestors. I also noted in previous reviews that there were some objections to the \"cartoonish\" aspect of some of the scenes. As an African American, I would not have been able to or even have wanted to see this movie without those features. I find it excruciating to view movies that relate the horrible, devastating experience of slavery in a realistic way. As it was, during some of the flashback scenes such as when Broomhilda is being flogged, the view of Django's ankles when the chains were removed, and when D'artangan was being ripped apart, I was brought to tears, because as we all know, these events actually occurred to fellow human beings. While others may have found the mildly comedic scenes cartoonish and jarring, I found them necessary, because just as the scenes became too painful to bear, there would be a humorous or humorously ironic scene inserted there in a manner that flowed well to me. Kerry Washington did not have a lot of dialogue, however,I did not feel that her skills were wasted because of this. Only an actor of her caliber could have put done so much with so little dialogue. She conveyed pain, heartbreak and joy in a very powerful, meaningful way. The entire cast was excellent. I found this movie to be another reason for me to be in love with QT. I thought he treated the subject matter respectfully and I am grateful for the \"slave revenge fantasy\". It was very cathartic.

As previous Tarantino movies, revenge is the main theme of the movie, but it doesn't seem to get old when Tantino is in charge. As usual there's a lot of long dialog, but it never drags the movie down. There is also a lot of brutal violence and a lot(I mean A LOT) of use of the N-word. The story is great and it never loses focus of the main character Django(Jamie Foxx), which was one of the small complaints I had about Basterds.I've never been a big fan of Jamie Foxx, but he is damn good in this. Christoph Waltz is great as Dr. King Schultz, the likable mentor of Django. Leonardo DiCaprio gives an outstanding performance as a slave owner, who is not to be messed with. I would love to see him do more roles like this. Samuel L. Jackson nails the Tarantino dialog as usual and plays one of the most morally disgusting characters I've seen in a long time. Tarantino himself appears as 2 different cameo's through out the movie and it's nice to see him back in action, because you can tell, that he had fun doing it.If you're a Tarantino fan, you will definitely enjoy it, just go see it!This is a little different that all of his other movies, so even if you're not a big Tarantino fan, there's a chance you will actually enjoy this.Here is how i would rate his other movies, to compare:Inglourious Basterds 9/10 Death Proof 5/10 Kill Bill Vol. 2 7/10 Kill Bill Vol. 1 8/10 Jackie Brown 8/10 Pulp Fiction 10/10 Reservoir Dogs 10/10",

Having written several reviews lambasting the preponderance of hate-filled garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass of as humor and comedy the past decade or so, it was more than a little refreshing to see some of the most hilarious, no doubt some will say politically incorrect, bits on the screen in what seems like ages. It's even more impressive that it's all done within the context of such a heavy, dark and violent story.If you've avoided seeing it because you thought you knew what it was or what to expect based on what you've read from the \"professional\" reviews you might want rethink that. We avoided it based on what we'd heard and read and thought we knew what expect and we couldn't have been more misled or wrong.The few knocks against it might be that it's about 20 to 30 minutes longer than it needed to be and the transition to the final act is a bumpy and tortured but enough to diminish the overall experience.",

            "content": "There's no words for how well done this film is. The script from Mr. Tarantino is, as always, a beautiful piece of artwork and you enjoy every bit of wicked and witty dialog - Especially because he's got the perfect actors to complete it. Christoph Waltz showed us all from the very first scene that he masters another great Tarantino- character, Dr. King Schultz a German bounty hunter who set out to find Django (Jamie Foxx) so that he can help him with his next job. Jamie Foxx's Django is spot on! I can not imagine anyone else play this role (and especially not Will Smith, sorry). And Leonardo DiCaprio... This may be his best role yet. He is the perfect villain for this story and Leo in a role like this is more than a joy to watch. And last but not least, Mr. Samuel L. Jackson. Wow, his role is so funny! When I watched the trailer I thought to myself \"what the hell is this\" but he defiantly pulled it off!The cinematography is beautiful and really fulfills this masterpiece together with the amazing costume work. I think y'all get it now, THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT. Go watch it asap!",

            "content": "Nowadays it is very hard to bring important messages via cinematography without making the audience bored. Representatives of Gen Z who spend most of their time surfing the internet are used to receive \"quick\" information from many different sources without getting into further details. That's why the approach of making long films without action is inappropriate for them. A case in point is the following question. How many young people watched \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" or \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"? These films are really important and devoted to social inequality and social just.\nQuentin Tarantino who is famous for bloody actions films filled with black humor and irony provides us with alternative approach in conveying important messages to the viewers. One of my favorite films directed by Tarantino is \"Django Unchained\". This film is devoted to the theme of discrimination and slavery in the US in 19th century. Events described take place in the US before the Civil War where German bounty hunter dr. Schultz and Django, former plantation worker unchained by Schultz, are looking for the Django's wife who was sold to another slaveholder. Tarantino, not bounded by public opinion or liberal Hollywood producers, shows us the whole cruel picture of American slavery with brutal whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, mutilation and imprisonment. Once you have seen this film, you will never treat discrimination like something appropriate for human community. You will really understand that providing equal opportunities for everyone is the only one way for humanity to develop.\nThe other good point for watching this film is its cast. Being a famous director, Tarantino could have attracted really gifted actors like Leonardo DiCaprio and Christoph Waltz to filming. For instance, enjoying their acting is a sufficient reason for watching the film",

            "content": "I love Spaghetti westerns. I love A fistful of dollars, for a few dollars more, and of course the movie that defines Spaghetti westerns... The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Yeah... Django Unchained doesn't even begin to hold a candle to any of those classics. The truth is I liked the performances. Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx were excellent. Even Leonardo Dicaprio's performance was okay. However, and this is a BIG however, this film, much like many of Tarantino's most recent works, needs editing, BADLY! I really didn't like Inglorious Basterds that much, and I don't like a lot of Tarantino's films because I feel the characters lack humanity. However... the characters Django and Doctor Schultz have some humanity in them. But did that raise this movie up? No it didn't! Instead, we get thirty gallons of blood spurting every other damn time somebody fires a gun, we get long stretches of movie that don't need to be there, and as a result I honestly believe the final product suffers from the unmitigated run time.Let's face it, the very inappropriate rap music hurts the film too. This is supposed to be a SPAGHETTI western! Not a damn Gangsta Drama set in the east side homie!!! Annoyed yet? Good, now you know how I felt because of the anachronistic soundtrack. Now, I admit there are times when anachronistic music can do a movie good(See Moulin Rouge), but there is no excuse in Heaven, Earth or(Yes, even Hell) that you can give me where we have to have frickin' gangsta rap playing over the soundtrack... OF A MOVIE TAKING PLACE IN THE 1850's!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm sorry, this just makes me so damn angry you can't even imagine.The gore and the blood and the unnecessary visceral details and the prolific use of the N-word detracts from this movie so badly that it does not feel anything like a genuine spaghetti western, not even close. I'll tell you why right now: I can't ever imagine ever watching Django Unchained ever again in my lifetime. It's just a soulless little movie that left me unhappy and regretting that I didn't go see Les Miserables instead.",

            "content": "This is a first impression review, after I've had a few days to think about the movie and work out what I liked and didn't like.First off, this is a very enjoyable movie and I would highly recommend watching it unless use of the N-word in movies offends you! When off to watch a new movie by a writer/director of Tarantino's reputation and calibre, you're inevitably going to have certain expectations, and I'm pleased to say that Tarantino does not fail to deliver with his use of strong characters, great dialogue and well- placed laughs. If this movie is one thing, it's entertaining.However, I left the theatre pretty confused, not because I didn't get the plot but because I really didn't get the point. I'm not saying that Tarantino's previous works are defined by some deeper meaning, but before this movie I would have described any of his pictures as being concise and polished, with a strong stylistic theme. 'Django Unchained', as stylish as it is in places, feels like a lot of really good ideas stapled together without much consideration for continuity. This effect was as evident in the music as it was in the cinematography, with very sudden changes from period pieces to contemporary Hip-hop. Although the combination of music and cinematography was largely very good.The plot seems to be split into individual segments: the creation of Shultz and Django's partnership; the winter of bounty hunting; and then Candieland, with no overlap at all, and some events seem to occur simply for the purpose of a scene, such as when the KKK arrive to lynch the protagonists and have their (very funny) 'bag' scene. Their is no explanation for how Shultz and Django know they are coming, and the scene is of no relevance to plot, character-development, or later events. Additionally, Tarantino has outdone himself with his cameo role in this one. His cameos are typically bad, but this one is horrific! The whole scene with the three Aussies is very poor, made worse only by Tarantino's inability to act. The other thing that hit me about this movie was the sense of characterture and over-the-top that seems to only grow throughout. Be it the use of a man named 'Candie' as the sugar-cane farming antithesis to the dentist, the amusing but certainly not stylish overuse of blood, to Django's final grin at the camera and ridiculous theme song, the film often feels like a parody, and I wonder if Tarantino just chose the slave-era south to enhance the movie's effect, rather than to make a point.For all of the things that annoyed me though, DiCaprio and Waltz are fantastic in this movie and I enjoyed every scene which they share. Jamie Foxx was very good too as Django, but perhaps wasn't given enough good dialogue to shine. Samuel L. Jackson was very very funny as Stephen, the black butler who thinks he's white, but was unmistakably himself. At least his role was something new.Overall it appears there is a lot to be said about this movie, which clearly makes it worth watching again and I imagine I'll appreciate some parts more when I do. I do however feel that with a more refined approach, the loss of some scenes and a greater sense of purpose this could have been quite a lot better. Whilst it's unmistakably Tarantino, 'Django Unchained' feels like 'Tarantino Unhinged'.",

She left the cinema saying of Tarantino \"He's an absolute genius\".That this can be accomplished given the copious gore, ample guns and a steady supply of explosive (and expletive come to that), is testament to Tarantino's mastery. Most of the film is spent in casual dialogue, effortlessly delivered amidst knife edge tension. The racism is up front and centre, breaking new ground where Blazing Saddles feared to tread. Jamie Foxx is more lovable the nastier he gets, Cristophe Waltz is moving beyond legend status into something else entirely. While he was familiar to me, I didn't even click it was him until the movie was finished. Now of course his performance seems amplified in it's magnificence when you stand it alongside Inglorious Basterds. I read that this is the first film that DiCaprio has been in where he was not given top billing. This surprised me (Gilbert Grape anyone?) but in many ways I feel that this was one where he would have deserved it. This comes of as a career defining performance. He totally breaks his own mould. It seems Tarantino has helped him to keep his trademark enthusiasm menacingly in check until given the all clear to explode. When he does, it's sickening, chilling even. DiCaprio unchained with a scene that leaves even Waltz lost for words. For a moment at least. And what a moment!Django Unchained is Tarantino at his best and devilish worst. My wife is right. The man is a genius, and he has given me leave to order a Quentin Box Set for a month or two of great Sunday viewing with the missus. Quality time.",

            "content": "The end of another year and lots of movies we've seen or still want to see. Our latest choice was to see what Jamie Foxx would do with his role as the slave Django in Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino apparently set out to out-Western every Western ever made, and out-bloody every bloody shootout ever filmed, Western or cops-and-robbers or whatever. It was a humorous satire with an underlying morale theme. The humor was seen in the outlandish outfits Django chose to wear, especially the Blue Boy suit he picked out when Dr. King Schulz (Christoph Walz), Django's savior, lets him choose anything he wants as his new wardrobe. More humor in the choice of background music as stereotyped by all the Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns of yesteryear, the incompetent band of KKKers who decide to forgo their head bags because they can't see what they were doing, the overblown scenic views too perfect to be real (the mountains, the rocky campsites, the bar with beer taps and glass mugs, the unlikely number of plantations underlings who respond to the shooting in the plantation mansion at Candyland, the amount of horrific blood-shedding in that final shootout, the high-stepping routine Django goes into with his horse as he shows off for his wife Broomhilda at movie's end. But always, beneath the humor and satire, is the indictment of an institution like slavery, an institution that too many antebellum whites could condone, could unthinkingly, inhumanely, believe that a human being could be owned, a piece of property to whom the owner could do anything with impunity. The acting was excellent\u2014Walz as the ex-dentist bounty hunter, DiCaprio as the effeminate Calvin Candie, Foxx as the \"fastest gun in the South,\" and Samuel L. Jackson as the truly evil reverse \"Steppin Fetchit\" house slave. But Christoph Walz is the best and will probably receive a nomination is the Oscar race.",

            "content": "As a Tarantino fan I was really exited to see his new movie. I expected nothing less that brilliance. The story. There actually is none. It's relatively simple - saving Django's wife. That is not what get this movie going. What gets the movie going are the dialogs. Classic Tarantino insanity. The dialogs are extremely fun to listen to and shockingly lifelike, especially the southern accents and pronunciation. Every character has his own way of talking, pronouncing words and communicating with others. I know this sounds a bit strange, but the way the characters talk is how their persona is shown. The very idea of presenting characters just through dialog is something only Tarantino knows how to do (remember Reservoir dogs). Also, an interesting fact is how certain characters are introduced in the movie. Every one of them had a specific environment in which we first see them, and the environment itself is a picture of what that character is like - showing the characters persona by introducing him in a specific environment (e.g. DiCaprio's first appearance). Also, the movie reeks of comic book styled, unrealistic and casual sequences that give it a necessary casualness.The acting. The acting is based on communication and interaction. The absolute God that deserves a Nobel prize for acting (and just for him it should be invented) is Christoph Waltz. His acting is mesmerizing. From his first scene to his last there is no one that can counter his style and elegance in what he does. His character is completely different that in Basterds, and he does such a wonderful job showing how he can act as a ruthless Nazi, and as a kind and goodhearted bounty hunter. Every other actor that finds himself close to Waltz in the movie is simply swept aside. Foxx for that reason, until the last 40 min is simply nonexistent. He is good, but Waltz actually destroyed him in every scene they had together (and that's the first 120 min). DiCaprio is exceptionally good. He finally escaped the identical roles of disturbed individuals he had in the last couple of years (Inception, Shutter Island, Departed) and showed that he has something else to offer that be messed up (not using curse words even though I should) the entire movie. His ruthlessness is disturbing, but the problem is, after some time his act becomes so visual one just doesn't believe in it anymore. He becomes frustrating and irritating, and I doubt that was the point. Still, way better than what he had done in the past couple of years. Now, the star of the second part of the movie is the almighty Samuel L. Jackson. The mask he wore and his acting made him so old my father (who saw the movie with me) didn't recognize him at first. Unlike DiCaprio who was meant to be the main bad guy, Jackson's diabolical persona is the one true villain in the movie. He did everything in his power to create the most despicable and hated character in the movie, and he succeeded. His signature word is used often and is well incorporated, his moves are those of a tired old man, his passion while acting is not from this world.The violence. Now, as a Tarantino fan I should already be used to his methods of directing and the gore his movies are filled with, but this is something different. This time, the violence is mental. It is not something you can't bare to watch because it is ugly to watch, it is violent because it is ugly to know how people were treated at that time. This movie shows what slavery was all about, it shows it in it's full gruesome and violent manner and criticizes it like no one has done so far. It's hard to watch how people were whipped, tortured and vandalized not because of the scene itself, but because you know that sort of thing was really going on. That sort of thing boiled my blood so much I wanted to kill every single slave owner in the movie singlehandedly (yet another element that shows how good the acting was and how good the script was). Although, the bloodbath at Candyland is really gory and gives a nice Tarantino touch to the whole thing.The music. An extremely interesting fusion of rap, country and western music, with Ennio Morricone's influence.A great, great movie that has two absolutely godlike roles and great supporting roles, with ridiculously brilliant dialogs, that deals with an issue of historical importance. Tarantino is the prototype of a director that never made a mistake in his movies. The older and crazier he is, the better his movies are. Oscars, well deserved.",

So, after we purchased our tickets, but for some reason we got late into the screening room and got bad seats, at the right side of the screen (usually we get in the room first and get seats at the center). So, the film finally starts, we lay back with high hopes as the movie trailers go through, and, finally, Django is on. I can honestly say that i was expecting a little bit of professional directing from Quentin, as the first scenes of the film were not shot as professionally as they should be. But, nevertheless, its Quentin Tarantino, so i respect the way he wanted it to be. Watching it, i have to say that the film was an n-word warfare, while raining blood and guts.. I enjoy gore in films, but i think there was more than enough blood when a person was shot. I mean, people got shot and blood fountains came out of their wounds..! The film was extremely violent, people getting eaten by dogs, blowing heads and torturing slaves.. Had a very good story line, excellent performances but, honestly, it was TOO long. Anyway, its a very nice film, i recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality movie.

            "content": "It's fair to say that unlike his main character, Quentin Tarantino was never really a director who was chained to begin with; i.e. he is characteristically a filmmaker who has always played by his own rules. This trademark is something that hasn't worked in his favour every time; his inherent fanboyism, passion for exploitation cinema and auteur style was something that came to bear (and not for the better) in his half of 2007's 'Grindhouse', 'Death Proof', an exercise in self-indulgence that is easily the worst film he's directed. But we cannot forget that he has delivered three slices of brilliance \u2013 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and the often-overlooked 'Jackie Brown'; a trio of movies that exemplify the talent he possesses. However, talented director doesn't always equal great film and Mr. Tarantino is now exception to this, as following the rather good 'Kill Bill Vol One', he made the decidedly 'meh' follow-up, the frankly bad 'Death Proof' and the just alright 'Inglourious Basterds', which may have been poor as its predecessor had it not been for Christoph Waltz and those two scenes. Which then brings us swiftly along to his eighth film, 'Django Unchained'.In the opening titles sequence we are introduced to a number of black slaves being dragged across expansive landscapes, in the antebellum year of 1858. In their company is Django (Jamie Foxx), who is freed by Dr. Schultz, a bounty hunter under the guise of travelling dentist (Christoph Waltz). Django's main concern is to be reunited with his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who was taken from him and sold to a plantation. Schultz then agrees that if the newly-free slave helps him to locate the nefarious Brittle Brothers, he'll aid him in his search for his wife.I'm certain there's a good chance you've heard of the controversy this movie is generating, primarily due to its frequent use of the N-word, with numerous people accusing it of racism. I can't say this was a problem for me; it never once felt as if that certain word was being over-used, but conversely felt natural, like an integral part of the era the film was portraying, i.e. there is cause for it. Even though 'Django' possesses a comedic spirit and an effectively brutal Mandingo fight, there is no question how seriously it takes slavery. In terms of its depiction of slavery, it is neither too nice nor 'Addio Zio Tom', in that it doesn't schmaltz things up but at the same time retains a level of maturity in approaching the subject. It's a tricky subject to get right on screen, but thankfully, Tarantino doesn't approach it with the same attitude he did the Nazis in 'Basterds' and instead offers an occasionally powerful look at the topic that never borders into overly- gratuitous territory. At the heart of the movie lies something that Tarantino hasn't really explored before: a love story. One of the most brilliant things about this film is that Django isn't a man trying to bring an end to slavery; he simply wants to find his wife and live happily with her. His love for Broomhilda is his only driving force over the course the relatively lengthy runtime. It's a surprisingly touching love story that helps the viewer engage in the story and root for Django as he embarks on his journey to rescue her from \"the dragon\".Much of the reason this works is due to a strong Jamie Foxx; he inhabits the screen with a great sense of presence and easily manages to make his character a likable and charismatic force on the screen. With the eventual casting of Hans Landa (coincidentally, the role was originally scheduled for Leonardo DiCaprio), Tarantino spotted a brilliant acting talent in the form of Christoph Waltz. His performance in that film was the best thing about it and here, he's just as good. In contrast to the villainous Landa, Schultz is a delight to watch and induces the movie with a real sense of warmth and humanity, forming a great double-act with Foxx. Then there's DiCaprio; after an absence from cinema screens since Christopher Nolan's 'Inception', he has returned to the movies with an absolutely fantastic performance as Calvin Candie, the owner of the plantation where Django's wife resides. Similar to Waltz, it feels like he's having the time of his life. He is electrifying as the slave owner with his awful teeth (one of the film's many inspired touches), particularly in the dinner-table sequence \u2013 a scene every bit as good (and tense) as those two lengthy scenes of dialogue in Tarantino's previous film. But the most impressive performance is possibly Samuel L. Jackson as Candie's slave and servant, Stephen; a character who is essentially the ultimate Uncle Tom. A truly nasty creation, he's encumbered with severe loyalty to his master and is disgusted by Django and how he's allowed \"into the big house\", frequently dropping the N-bomb when referring to him. Jackson is a deeply chilling and equally magnetic presence on screen, in the first role I've ever witnessed him lose himself entirely in. 'Django Unchained' could be considered a long film, clocking in at 165 minutes, yet it never feels boring and zips along at a rollicking pace, hopping from one great scene to another in captivating motion. It's also aided by Robert Richardson's consistently beautiful cinematography, a great soundtrack and a number of touches of pure directorial genius, such as the blood drops splashing on the flowers. It's not perfect, Kerry Washington is competent in her performance but is somewhat wasted and Tarantino's cameo as an Australian plantation owner is terrible. But these slip-ups do little to damage this wonderful movie overall. This is an audacious and brutal piece of filmmaking that may well be Tarantino's best film since 'Pulp Fiction', let alone 'Jackie Brown'. He probably thinks it's a masterpiece and in this instance, I'm tempted to agree. In other words, I loved it.",

And that felt great to me as a viewer, to digest the different stages of revenge alongside our hero. The first time Django gets his chance to avenge the brutality and humiliation he and his woman were exposed to, he furiously and uncontrollably whips and then shoots one of the Brittle brothers. And I felt the same hot blooded passion. When Calvin Candy gets one bullet through his despicable heart, I was surprised, but later thought: serves him well, not waste any other second on that scumbag. And when Stephen and the rest of the household get their share, you laugh at the cool, composed piece of showmanship (panache, anyone?) that Django has come up with. A sweet dessert after a heavy 3,4,5 course meal. Concerning the N word. Yes, it is used in abundance. But at crucial moments it is absent, and that is what also counts, I think. For example, in the final little flashback when Schultz says to Django something like: 'They will call you the fastest gun in the South'. So in this final assessment of Django's achievement in the movie, Schultz makes no mention of the fact that he is a liberated black slave. He is a damn good gunslinger. And a damn good gunslinger he was.",

            "content": "Last week, Charlie Rose, on his PBS interview programme, spent one wonderful hour with Tarrantino discussing \"Django Unchained\" as well as giving a master class on cinema history. Well worth checking out, if it is on \"YouTube\" or Charlie Rose's website.Prior to the film commencing, there were four rushes of upcoming films, all drenched in gunplay and violence. In a post Newtown world, I felt very uncomfortable watching these previews, and slightly guilty at the bloodbath that \"Django\" promised to be. On the other hand, the entire show, including \"Django\", presented something of an overview of what the gun represents in American society: The Instrument of Vengeance/Justice, symbol of manhood, authority, individual freedom, the State, institutional power, and just plain fun. Very disturbing......... \"Django Unchained\", which I saw on Sunday 30 December 2012, is somewhat more serious than other Tarranatino films. Oh, there is the trademark humour, if a little underplayed than in the past, as well as the B-movie sensibilities. Tarrantino himself acknowledges that the film has more of a linear narrative than his past work. More than anything, though, this film seriously presents Tarrantino's understanding of the experience of American slavery, as well as his own revulsion of the institution. As such, \"Django\" presents as archetypes the slave as the central character, the rage that he feels towards the enslavers, the white liberal stand-in for himself (Christof Waltz), the dichotomy and conflict between the plantation slaves and the house slaves,the slave owners themselves (Don Johnson and a superb Leo DiCaprio), and a very Inglorious Basterds' fantasy of what visceral vengeance could look like, all dressed up in a spaghetti western sensibility. Not to be missed.",

The problem is the lack of editing.Let me start by saying that the star of this movie is Leonardo DiCaprio. Everyone else did their job very well. Waltz did fine but his mannerisms were tailor-made for Inglorious Basterds. Foxx -- yeah, not bad at all. But DiCaprio was just tremendous, as memorable as in Titanic. I wasn't sure, but now I'm certain he's a versatile and just awesome actor. Oh, and Samuel Jackson was also amazing. Wow! That gets me to my point: the movie should have ended when DiCaprio was killed and have Jackson die at the same time. They were the standout characters. So all that shooting afterward was just pointless IMO.Tarantino is perhaps a bit like Billy Walsh in Entourage where heavy editing is needed but Walsh always believes that everything he does is art and can't be tampered with in any way. Actually, there's not heavy editing needed here. I do believe Tarantino is a movie genius. It just should have ended earlier; everything else was perfect. Same goes for Inglorious Basterds -- perfect, but why have the 70s font for credits at the end? That needed a German Nazi font!Would have been a 10 but can't go above an 8.

For me, the movie is about blending at the very least 3 elements - a subverted form of reality which challenges our fixed and deep rooted notions, our inner reality manifesting itself in bizarre and almost heroic decisions and actions, and the ugly reality of how things really are, to create a scintillating, at time surreal, and an almost comic effect. Yes, the movie does come off as a little loosely strung, kind of patchy, with some parts accelerating with great velocity, while others seem to crawl..In that sense, the movie is a wonderful series of well-shot scenes. The acting by at least the main is almost flawless...I particularly liked Jamie Foxx's character...his naivete and yet his struggle to assert his individuality in the light of his new found freedom have been brilliantly portrayed by the director and the actor...a job well done All in all, its hard to go wrong with Tarantino when it comes to entertaining his audience. For me, the even greater takeaway was the subversion of reality as we have been made to understand it..Its difficult to explain, easier to be experienced.

The movie takes place in a period when still Slavery was still existing which is depicted brilliantly by the Director(Quentin Tarantino). I personally love western cowboy movies but this movie is unique with its awe creating, beautifully written script after a long time of this nature.The movie begins by Christoph Waltz (Playing the doctor/bounty hunter) releasing Django from in-order to take his help to find some criminals and to collect the bounty by killing them. The character is written in such a format that he is ahead of his time, he doesn't believe what the other people have accepted and practice. Therefore he sees Django not as a slave but as a equal and trains him the art of bounty hunting.The django is the main character, who is been shown as a man who is different from the breed - \" A man whose soul is not broken\", who has the courage to fight and be a bounty hunter with exceptional skill in shooting. Jamie Foxx has played the role perfectly.The movie characters are played excellently by Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington and of course Samuel L. Jackson ( who plays a negative role). The movie takes turn when django tries to free his wife Kerry Washington ultimately leading to the climax.The main reason why should some one watch this is because it stays to true to its script ( the depictions, music, scenery etc..) and surely you will enjoy it.",

            "content": "I was really excited to see this film in theaters in the winter, and I was disappointed I didn't get that opportunity. When my family and I saw it in DVD for the first time, I was completely amazed!!! CAN YOU SPELL AWESOME!!! This movie is incredible! I've never seen an entire Quintin Tarintino film before, and this was a great introduction to his style of filmmaking for me! It's funny, it's dramatic, it's suspenseful - it's got everything you'd want in a good movie!The main two reasons I really love this movie has to do with the two most important things I think every dramatic production should have: a great characters and good stories. The story has a lot of twists and turns that I didn't see coming. The scene where Dr. Schultz kills Candie, that totally took me by surprise!! While the film has a lot of action and suspense, it doesn't take away from the story of the film. At the heart of it, a man wants to get back with his wife. We're never steered away from that during this film. Also, these characters are just fantastic! Django is a great hero, Dr. Schultz is a hilarious witty bounty hunter, Candie is an enjoyable slaveholder (kind of a contradiction of terms...), and Stephen is a great villain for this movie! Did you ever think a slave would be such a dynamic villain in a slave movie? But, then again, what do you expect when that character is played by Samuel L. Jackson?!There are some things I find weird about this movie, however. It all centers around the idea that this movie takes place during slavery in the U.S.A. For example, there's a rap song in one of the scenes in this movie. For me personally, it took me out of the magic. I thought to myself, \"Wait, what? Rap in the 1800s? That's not right.\" It doesn't distract too many people, but it did distract me. Another weird moment for me is the Ku Klux Klan scene. Don't get me wrong, it is funny, but is that really what you think of when the KKK comes to your mind? Everyone says this is a movie about slavery, when really it's a movie that just takes place during slavery. I feel like it's 2012 tells the story of 1861, but not exactly 1861. I feel like this a few times during this movie. Again, I really like this movie; but if you want a movie that stays truer to slavery itself and not just its time period, you should probably look at \"Roots.\"One thing I don't understand, however, is the controversy surrounding this movie. A lot of the talk is simply mind boggling to me! Many people have said that this movie is racist...Uh, what? Where did that come from? I can understand some people not liking the movie, but how in the world is it racist? Is it because it takes place during slavery? So, then, is \"Roots\" racist, too? Is it because a number of White people are killed in this movie? What about the movies that have 1 Black person, and he/she is killed before the end of the film? What about the movies that have no Black people? Are those racist? Is it because it showed mean and cruel White men and women as vicious slaveholders and racists? What about the movies with negative stereotypes of Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, etc.? Are those racist as well? I'm sorry, but I cannot sit by so calmly while people protest movies like this racist while other films that gave America minorities no justice are considered beloved classics! This movie is simply trying to tell a story and show excellent, strong characters. What's wrong with that?Again, I love this movie. It is a fantastic, brilliant film that I think you'll really love. The moments I mentioned earlier that expels me from being fully in 1861 can be distracting, but I'm still captured by the magnificent story and characters. For me, that's where the greatness of this movie lies! The effects are great, the suspense is awesome, but the story and characters are the elements that make this movie great! You'll enjoy it! BOOYIKA!",

It is set during the slave period of the US south and there are very graphic depictions of the physical violence used during that time. Jamie Foxx does a fine job as Django, a slave required by a bounty hunter Dr King Shultz, played by Christoph Waltz, to identify brothers that are wanted for crimes. As Django and Shultz team up the movie unfolds with much violence and use of the \"N\" word. It reaches a point where Dr Shultz is killed and that is where the movie ends in my mind. Shultz was by far the most interesting character in the movie and after his death, I did not care anymore. Leonardo DiCaprio overplayed his role as he can easily do as a villainous slave and plantation owner. Actors Samuel Jackson and Don Johnson both were excellent in their respective roles but Christoph Waltz was the standout in this film and as mentioned, after his death, there is no movie anymore.",

That fact proves to me that this movie has served a useful American societal function - a candid view of our troubled racial past.

            "review_title": "Tarantino's best since Jackie Brown",
            "content": "Although he'd probably negate the claim, Tarantino is one of America's last standing auteur filmmakers. He's crafted his niche, with a mixture of horror-show violence, expletive-laden dialogue, pop soundtracking, cinephile anachronism and Samuel L. Jackson cameos. Following several fanboy duds, Kill Bill, Death Proof and Inglourious Basterds, he returns to the big screen with Django Unchained; more nefarious, iconoclastic and iconographic than ever. In short, it's Tarantino, through-and-through, and the best film he's released since Jackie Brown.A playful homage to the old fashioned tropes of Blaxploitation cinema, Spaghetti Westerns, and Corbucci's landmark 1966 outlaw, Tarantino transports the eponymous Django \u2013 aka, 'the fastest shooter in the South' \u2013 to a pre-Civil War America, and gives him a racial transformation, to boot. Superbly played by Jamie Foxx, our beloved hero starts out as a shackled, cowering slave, being dragged through the forest to an auction house. Along the way, he is bought by Dr Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a verbally dexterous German dentist turned mercenary. After a gory transaction, the pair start out an unlikely business partnership as salt-and-pepper bounty hunters, catching outlaws and picking up the state-paid levy. They even get the chance to rub out an impish gang of Ku Klux Klan copycats (they hold no purpose to the narrative, but their Blazing Saddles style idiocy routine brings some excellent bawdy humour to the bloodied proceedings).This first story takes up about 80 minutes of the film's overall running time. We get to see Django go through class elevation, from slave to a cowboy on horseback, to a free-man with a vengeance. The pair set out to find Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), now the property of Calvin Candie (DiCaprio) a savage Mississippian plantation owner, notorious across the land for treating his slaves like butchered flesh. I think a showdown is in order.Not only is the story complex and novelistic, the characters are fabulously drawn, with some beautiful set and costume design from Leslie A. Pope and Sharen Davis (both cheated out of Academy Awards nods). After a defining performance as a smooth operating Nazi general in Inglourious Basterds, Waltz puts his natural charisma to the force of good as the affable Shultz, twiddling his moustache and moving with a sprightly gate, perfectly matched with Foxx's cool, swaggering renegade. It's also the best DiCaprio performance I've seen in recent memory, so pantomimic as the venemous Candie, a man who details African slaves' inferiority through insipid phrenological study, whose astonishing good looks cover up his black heart, and blacker teeth.As if that wasn't enough mesmerising performances to get to grips with, Tarantino calls upon old favourite Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen, the supreme leader to Candie's impoverished slaves. He's an Uncle Tom, of sorts, eerily servile and complacent to the white family which he longs to be a member of, whilst deducing the people of his same African patronage off to be mercilessly sold like cattle. Every time he chuckles along with Candie you feel like retching, whenever he callously drops 'the n-word' it leaves an impact like a shotgun wound. It's the most wretched, unsettling character Tarantino has ever created, and certainly a career best for the admired Mr. Cruel Cool.Like many a Tarantino project, the film's main issues are in it's pacing and meandering direction. It's as if he and editor Fred Askin were too busy geeking out over fanboy film chat that they forgot to produce anything more than a loose rough cut. However, just like his previous work, Django Unchained is never boring. In fact, it's often absolutely mesmerising, with dirtied lensed visuals mixed with a cine-literate soundtrack of arcane Ennio Morricone orchestrations, mixed with present day hip-hop from Wu-Tang Clan chief RZA.Some have perceived it as a gross opportunistic rehashing of America's darkest era, but I think that does the film a great disservice. Unlike Spielberg and his current Lincoln movie, or Zero Dark Thirty from Kathryn Bigelow, Tarantino has somehow earned the right to produce films which are exempt from scruples and questions of veracity. You simply get them or you don't. If you're after a history lesson, this is certainly not the film for you. If bloodied, hilarious and offensive entertainment is the order of the day, then Django Unchained is a must-see. Welcome back, Tarantino; you brilliantly stubborn bastard, you.",

He initially struggles a bit in the role but later (in the movie) recoups to do very well. Christoph Schultz as 'Dr. King' is the one who steals the show. He has put in a great performance and has absolutely sunk in self into the character of 'Dr. King'. DiCaprio as the antagonist 'Candie' has been absolutely breathtaking in his portrayal. The scene where he explains the dimples on the skull is terrific!. Kerry Washington as 'Broomhilda' has essayed her role well. SLJ as 'Stevens' has done great as well. All these lead players have been supported by a very capable supporting cast.The Cinematography is great. Editing could have been a bit better. I felt that the storyline could have been a bit crisp as I really felt the duration of the movie (a long span of 165 minutes).

Places In the Heart, Lincoln, Ruby Bridges, etc)He's just about ruined every movie I've seen him in it. In my view, DiCaprio isn't very original - he is at most an amateur & overrated actor. Same tone. Same face. Same expression, NOTHING! - No matter what people or Hollywood say. I can't take him seriously in basically ANY role he's in, not even when he uses a ridiculous accent or wears hilariously bad makeup (even though he looks like a 15 year-old girl).(And I'm GLAD he's not playing Steve Jobs; I mean, does he have to play *every single person* throughout history???)In hindsight, DiCaprio's talent really is just limited to screaming & shouting - I'm not joking!There're some exceptions to the rule of course, but most child actors grow up to be talentless hacks (ie. Macaulay Culkin, Haley Joel Osmit, Edward Furlong, Gary Coleman, Corey Feldman, etc). And I'm certain that also includes DiCaprio.I'm not surprised he hasn't won an Oscar - if he did, I'd be really disappointed. Actually, *I* would give him an Award for 'Most Overrated Actor' of all time.(I believe he should've retired after \"Titanic\".) He doesn't deserve a majority of the praise he gets for playing the same spoilt, whiny, degenerate, antisocial, insecure, repressive, foul-mouthed, sinful, condescending character in so many damn movies... Couldn't he try playing a more unflappable character soon?? (One who doesn't LOSE THEIR S*** at the drop of a hat!?)

The trick to this movie is not to watch it for a couple years. When you watch this after a while; it will bring you to such a pinnacle of rejoicing of righteous indignation; it is incomparable to any movie made to man. Django's love for Broomhilda Von Shaft being his saving grace and ultimate power accessibility is the story of the history of man. The very center point being; the love of a man to the love for a woman, being the culmination of the retribution of a entire population of a oppressed people is absolutely believable and that is why you cannot deny the infallibility of the message of this script.

In the second half of the film, I got the feeling he was trying to break a world's record for how many times he can squeeze the \"n\" word into the script. Dialog was good, but not as entertaining as his previous scripts - the one notable exception was the banter between Don Johnson's band of riders.

At the heart of this tangle of coolness is the director and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino himself, for this, you need to start promoting this work from him.Tarantino, like his character, threw off the shackles of genres, the difficulties of accepting fresh work and focused on what he loves and knows best - \"spaghetti western\". The genre at first glance is simple, like a gingerbread, pour everything with ketchup and jam with actors, however, only Tarantino and one more person today can shoot spaghetti westerns and trash separately without confusing these concepts. For all the comicality, bloodiness and conventionality, Quentin draws realistic slavery, realistic people, realistic love within one canvas and generally digs traditionally deeper than you expect.With the hero of the day, Tarantino has fooled everyone. Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio are as good as you can expect from them in the current situation and even more. But the script is written primarily under Christoph Waltz and with his participation in a painstaking process; he is the king here, he is the central character, this is his benefit performance. His talent once again creates such things that the film wants to be reviewed in any case. To do this, by the way, since 2013, distributors have been intensively showing original film tracks with subtitles in cinemas (in addition to dubbing), which will be very valuable for many.",

Each scene had very subtle signatures that made the content relevant to its time and even more so relevant to the characters. The development of the story was so perfect and believable that i was in awe by each scenes climax. I experienced every emotion, fear, disgust, amazement, pride, and this is just to name a few.

            "content": "It's very difficult to go and see a movie like Django Unchained without having formed preconceptions before setting eyes upon the actual content, such is the range of discussion and diversity of writing that has taken place prior to its release in the UK. However, not possessing a certain Mr Lee's abilities of precogntion, I decided to wait until not only watching, but also digesting, the piece before sharing with you my own opinion.As I settled back into my seat and the credits rolled, I instantly felt like I was back at my Auntie's house, watching the spaghetti westerns on Saturday nights that the BBC put on during the 1970's. There is a look and a feel and an atmosphere common to the genre that I think he gets just about spot on. Although an early scene of astounding jokey bloody surprise also reminded me that this wasn't homage pure and simple.From the off, Christoph Waltz (who I can't pretend to have any prior knowledge of) inhabits his role in a brilliant fashion. As Jamie Foxx then shifts into shots as well, he smoothly becomes a charismatic and cool co-hero, someone who you're quickly shown has both a moral compass in a messy world, but also who has a drive to get his girl back. Their partnership is Jules and Vincent for another era maybe, two different people with different motivations but a common bond and sense of humanity.It's a classic three-ring circus of a film, and each section progresses the plot and develops different strands in a way that works well overall. What I think Tarantino does particularly well is balance the backdrop of a pre-civil-war USA, with the apparent wide acceptance of the slave trade and the inferiority of black people, and his take on a pseudo-Blaxploitation version of a redemptive spaghetti Western. The comedy violence is comedy, the horrors allowed by slavery are played straight and implied, with nothing that could be taken as glorification or negation.The language is strong, and particularly I feel the use of MoFo in the dialogue (and hip-hop in the soundtrack) can again be seen as balancing the pastiche and the present, reminding the viewer that this is a new take on old tales. That isn't to say that there aren't some flaws. Since Roger Avary parted company with QT, the writing isn't always as good as it was in my opinion, some of the plot devices are a bit heavy-handed, and I'm still not sure how QT's cameo appearance measures up (unless he was deliberately playing it awful, in homage to the extras of some of the original westerns, which is clearly a possibility).And it has to be said that the demise of his character certainly provided one of the biggest laughs of the evening. Overall, I think Tarantino has crafted a very good original work in the style of some of his earlier pieces. Samuel L Jackson gives a great performance as always when they work together, and Leonardo Di Caprio is unusually immersive. I do agree with others that the female characters are universally lacking in depth, especially Hilde, although again this could simply represent QT's take on the back catalogue's approach to gender? Whatever, I recommend you see this movie to make up your own mind. It's three hours well spent in my opinion, and hopefully marks a move back towards some further rewarding output from Tarantino and friends.",

Tarantino is all over this movie, with good comedic moments and extremely bloody and violent fight scenes. It also has those scenes of extended dialogue known to Tarantino. I did not enjoy this movie as much as Tarantino, mostly because the violence in this movie is much more gruesome in my opinion and I simply like the 1940s time period better. The amount of very bloody violence turned my rating south somewhat, especially the dog scene and the two slaves fighting when Django and Schultz first meet Mrs. Candie. Those scenes were quite disturbing. On the other hand, Waltz's performance is phenomenal as usual. He is very entertaining to watch, always making every scene much more entertaining. The long dialogues could get boring, but he keeps them interesting. Foxx is also pretty good and so is Dicaprio. It is a rather long film, but keeps you entertained as to not notice the movie being that long. Overall 8/10.",

            "content": "Django Unchained is a film about a freed Slave taking revenge and claiming bounties on American slavers in 1858. The film stars Jamie Foxx as Django Freeman, Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Shultz, Leonard DiCaprio as Monsieur Calvin Candy, Kerry Washington as Broomhilda, and Samuel L. Jackson as Monsieur Candy's house slave, Stephen Warren. This is Quentin Tarantino's 7th directed film, and it serves as a tribute to Spaghetti Westerns, as well as a Slavery Revenge story.The film's story is grounded in American history and race. The topic of slavery is incredibly sensitive. Most slavery films dedicate themselves to inhumanity and torture. Django is no different, however it tells a story that adds a layer of satisfaction and triumph in the form of revenge. Undoubtedly, Django Unchained is a journey worth the destination. The protagonists are incredibly likeable. All the same, the antagonists are some of the best in cinema, because they are absolutely vile and despicable. The story never has a dull moment. It is filled with enthralling dialogue and boisterous action that captivates at every turn.The acting in Django is incredible. The entire cast play their roles masterfully. Jamie Foxx as Django is one of the greatest casting decisions in a Tarantino film. Django's stone cold, yet charismatic demeanor is one of the film's brightest spots. Additionally, Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio give the performances of their lives. Waltz is one of the lesser known leads of the film who shines and stands out with the greats. His portrayal of Dr. King Schultz is awe-inspiring. DiCaprio as Monsieur Calvin Candy is scary good. He delivers this role with a sense of passion and prejudice that adds to the believability of his character as one of the film's main antagonists. Monsieur Candy's authenticity is further certified with the support of Samuel L. Jackson's character Stephen. Jackson fully embraces the role of house slave without any hesitation. Jackson elevates every scene that he is in with his intimation and wittiness. Finally, despite having a smaller amount of screen time, Kerry Washington masterfully captures facial expressions and body language. She adds a sense of urgency and fear to the film amid more extreme emotion. Altogether, this cast is incredible and their characters all the same.The cinematography in this film is true to Westerns. The sharp zooms and wide shots add a feeling of grandeur to the film. Action sequences are easy to follow, and very exciting to watch. Moreover, there are scenes featuring scenery that is beautiful to look at. Cinematographer, Robert Richardson successfully captures the zeitgeist of the film's setting in a way that simultaneously blends in with the contemporary.The editing of the film is very stylish. At times, flashbacks in the film are utilized in a unorthodox manner, however they add weight to the film's narrative. The film heavily uses music to set the tone. Sometimes, music is used too much, but it does not hurt the scenes. The soundtrack is one of the best in cinema, blending the music of westerns with Hip Hop and R&B. The sound mixing is very hard-hitting. Every action sound (punch, gunshot, explosion, etc.) feels bombastic.Overall, Django Unchained is a classic. It successfully blends the genre of historical period piece telling of Slavery, and a Western telling of a Outlaw's triumph. The film's use of language and action enhances the stakes and adds emotional weight toward the viewer. While at times, uncomfortable to watch, it concludes with one of the most satisfying endings in cinema. Django Unchained is a prime example of Quentin Tarantino's boldness and his love for all things cinema and history.",

Strikingly Samuel L. Jackson appears villainous with his sly and dreadful countenance. And the protagonist, Django Foxx vibrantly adapts himself with the Quentin culture. Tarantino tremendously pulls and mocks the American society's dark and cruel attitude towards slaves. His script is both intense and insane with brilliant repartee; while OSTz are even ace to suit with the sadistic sequences to amuse us.

The storyline concerns a German bounty hunter (Waltz) who frees a slave (Foxx) with the intention of using him to track down The Brittle Brothers. Waltz then proceeds to help Foxx rescue his wife from a ruthless plantation owner (DiCaprio). It is blatantly unfortunate to see how important Sally Menke, Tarantino's deceased Editor and \"greatest collaborator\", was at shaping the films which he wrote and directed. The editor who assumed the late Menke's role was Fred Raskin, whose filmography contains such fast-paced flicks as the The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), Fast and Furious (2009) and Fast Five (2011). The title says it every time, \"fast\", and Raskin who is obviously used to quick cutting brings an uncharacteristic pace to the film when compared to Tarantino's previous work. Right from the first scene it is evident that Raskin deviated from Tarantino's previous stylistic goals while editing the first cut during production. In the initial scene the pace of the editing is far too quick and the focal points tend to jump all over frame between these quick-cuts; ultimately disorienting the viewer and does not achieve what he could have been delivered more powerfully. Tarantino could fix only so many problems with Raskin's work, and since film is a collaboration he clearly had to compromise in certain areas. Compounded upon the shoddy editing, we have some pretty awful music choices which detract from the film and present no added benefit, albeit the opening theme is superb. There truly is a better film hiding in-between the poor editing and improper music choices. I'd say give Django a watch, if only to listen to the great dialogue... Take it this way, if I was blind this film would have come off much better. From the great highs to the unforgivable lows, Tarantino's sly cameo is one of the more entertaining moments where he refers to Django as \"black\", and not as a \"n****r\" like everyone else. Overall, Django Unchained only succeeds in being offensive, failing atrociously where Tarantino's films have flourished so well in the past. However, with my pretensions aside, one cannot deny Taratino's deft skill as a controversial and entertaining film-maker. S",

They go looking for 2 brothers who Dr. Schultz has a warrant for.

I'd like to simply talk a little bit about my thoughts on the film.It's no revelation that Tarantino is a master of taking specific genres and giving them his special spin. Some efforts work better than others. This is one of them. Django Unchained is a love fest for those fond of Westerns (especially the over the top foreign ones) using an unflinching look at slavery as the back drop. This being said, prepare yourself for a lot of unsavory language. You sensitive types might have an issue here.The violence is extensive, the deaths almost comically graphic and the humor...humorous. Foxx delivers his best performance ever in my opinion and DiCaprio was so greasy I felt the need to shower when I got home which was the intention I am sure.If you are wondering if it is acceptable for kids - there is virtually nothing by way of sexual content other than mild discussion about it and nudity is less than minor flashes of boob and testicle but not sex related. Pretty much the only objectionable material is the almost non-stop use of the N word and other foul language combined with plenty of killing. I would say enlightened kids over 14 or 15 are okay. Honestly, the red band trailer for Seth Rogen's new movie that played before the film started was the most offending part of the evening.This one fits in third for me after the Kill Bills and Pulp Fiction.

It's a rich film with outstanding attention to detail in the set and costume design and also the over-the-top characters. Really top notch adult entertainment at its best. Unfortunately the curse of self indulgent Tarantino did rear its ugly head during the last half hour which is annoying when it was going so well. You can almost pin point the moment it turns. I heard an interview with the director recently where he says he shoots his scenes in the order they appear in the film. If this is true then it might explain why the last part of Django feels over extended and ill fitting with the rest of the movie. You can tell so much that Tarantino loves to direct, he loves the hands on, maybe he just doesn't want the process to end. He definitely shouldn't have appeared in it. I don't really have a problem with the over the top shoot out but it may have been a little immature and blood thirsty in places. It's never sick because you (or rather I did) start to get desensitised to the excessive violence and that's a problem. It just feels out of place when compared to the rest of the film. Loved the music all the way through. Didn't like scurrying men like kill bill. Loved Candy. L Jackson OMG, legend. Loved swirling smoke over Djangos hat. It's so good I can't stop thinking about it. Me and my girlfriend were like excited school kids leaving the cinema. She agreed with me that the last 20 or 30 mins let it down somewhat. It's a shame but I guess that's tino for ya. He probably gets off on the splatter stuff. It's all real not CGI which is nice. It's weird when I was watching the massive bloody shootout it made me feel very weird like a kind of adrenaline high my forehead pricked with sweat. All that blood its strangely intimate. I felt like I could have blushed like I was seeing a personal side to the director I didn't like but at the same time was massively engulfed in the woozy feeling. Black magic. Black people are sexy though. Anyways. Great film, certainly unique. Can't wait to see what else this man can do. Long live QT !",

He, and his wife too, has 'r' mark on his cheek, which is burned when he tried and failed to 'run' away. When he finds his former owners as bounty targets, his revenge starts to go off.Django's character development is quite winding. Everyone will loves him when he eagerly asks Schultz to tell the German folklore about Broomhilda, the same name as his wife's. But as Schultz educate him as a bounty hunter, a kind of Frankenstein twist starts. His innate anger is fiercer than Schultz has expected. And it is rightly so.The depiction of cruelty of slave owners is agonising. Every time they tortured slaves almost due to their pleasure, I wtote down in my mind ledger how much they will have to pay for that. And what tortured me was the fear Tarantino might fail to get them paid properly, choosing to put an unwanted tragic end on Django.But it never happened. The directer brilliantly gives every torturerer what they deserves. The shoot-them-up scene in Candie's mansion is total catharsis. Splatting blood, flying bullets, in almost Matrix-like slowmotion and a gang hip-hop song.As for the real slavery issue, I learned some people criticize the film for, as far as I understand, using this as just entertainment material. They sound understandable to me. I was kind of baffled myself, at the ending scene where Broomhilda covers her ears as Candie's mansion is blown off by dynamites. I felt as if I was told that \"take it easy, the whole movie is just comic, don't take it so seriously\". But what the point of the excessively cruel torture scenes, if they are not to remind us of the real tragidy of slavery history?",

            "content": "Django Unchained is written and directed by a veteran of exploitation films whose debut feature \"Reservoir Dogs\" depicted violent scenes punctuated with countless expletives--a politically incorrect style that recurs throughout his career. This consistency in pattern brings to mind the implicit criticisms and allegations recently brought upon him during a heated exchange with a Channel 4 news journalist. Two decades in and Quentin Tarantino's ethics as a film maker--it appeared--are suddenly called into question simply because the interviewer saw fit to venture (unannounced) into philosophical-social psychological territory.Violence in films (it seemed) is now synonymously associated with gun violence in meat space. By refusing to answer loaded questions grounded in knee-jerk assumptions, Tarantino was thus rendered unprofessional and perhaps even tacitly guilty. In my opinion, the accusative tone so implicit in the method of interview was intellectually dishonest and sensationalistic. But I digress, so back to reviewing this film. Inspired by Sergio Corbucci's \"Django\" and Richard Fleischer's \"Mandingo\", Django Unchained is a highly entertaining fusion of western and exploitation genres depicting main protagonist Django's (Jamie Foxx) transition, from enslaved helpless negro, to a shrewd and sharp shooting hero.This film is a classic example of metaphorical power put to brilliant, dramatic use. From the opening; we are shown the rough and massive terrain Django has to surmount in his journey to rescue Broomhilda (deliberately misspelled from mythological maiden \"Brunhilda\" for comic effect)--his wife sold into slavery at Candyland. The villain standing in his way is a ruthless and sadistic man; Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), owner of the slave plantation where Hilda is held captive. Now that Django's escaped the brutal fate of being a slave, he will abide by the moral code of reciprocity and rescue the love of his life. As for how he came to possess the guts and resources to undertake this dangerous mission fraught with gun toting white supremacists, well, that is explained by bizarre affinity with bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (acting maestro Christoph Waltz).I shall not go into excruciating details and spoil this otherwise enjoyable film. It has a running time of 165 minutes but do not let that deter you from watching. Comprised of clever denotative and connotative symbols commonly used to great effect by cinematic auteurs, Django Unchained is an accessible yet dynamic piece of work. That Quentin Tarantino waxes lyrical and morbid humor (and gets away with using the n-word) in this superb revenge flick is just icing on the cake. I hope he wins this year's Oscar for best original screenplay.P.S. It is a shame that Samuel L. Jackson wasn't nominated for his chilling portrayal of Stephen, a racist black servant.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",

            "content": "\"Django Unchained\" is a film that really is unchained. Its constant use of blood and violence is used as a form of entertainment, but not many people acknowledge this film as a real part of history. However strange this film is, with all of its oddities and extreme scenes and dialogue, it is a very good testament to how things were back then.However, and that is a very large however, Mandingo fighting, or the practice of pitting 2 slaves against each other for their owner's entertainment, was largely false. David Blight, a professor at Yale's center for the study of slavery, has said that \"One reason slave owners wouldn't have pitted their slaves against each other in such a way is strictly economic. Slavery was built upon money, and the fortune to be made for owners was in buying, selling, and working them, not in sending them out to fight at the risk of death.\" His logic makes a lot of sense to me, and unfortunately the entire film is based upon Mandingo fights existing in that time period.However, other films such as \"Mandingo\" (1975) portray its existence, and its sequel has a sequence where an actual fight is had. However, Quentin Tarantino has said that his representation of Mandingo fighting was based upon the film \"Mandingo\" and its sequel, \"Drum\". This really discounts the legitimacy of Django Unchained's representations of the sport, as it is a secondary source of an already shaky film.Another point to be considered is that a German man was living in the United States as a bounty hunter. During the 19th century, there was a large amount of migration from Germany to the US, for farming and commerce purposes. The film Django Unchained began in 1858, and from 1851-1890 alone, there were almost 1 Million German immigrants to the United States. This makes the main characters existence in the story highly plausible. One of the main concentrations of Germans was in Baltimore, where a large part of the story is held.Overall, the film stretches the idea of plausibility, as most Tarantino films do, and does it while creating a significantly accurate image of the time period. While the main base of the story is not the most accurate, factually, it creates enough factual ideas around it for it to be forgiven.",

Not as much as in Inglorious Basterds (2009), but still a stellar performance.The writing was... interesting. I don't know if it deserved the awards it got. The characters that were crafted were quite good. The main writing that made it was the relations and dialogue between the characters. I just don't know.The direction was not bad at all. It felt a bit more like Inglorious Basterds (2009) than Pulp Fiction (1994), in a cartoonish kind of way, but was still solid. The pacing made it seem slower than it should have been and therefore made me feel as though I was in a movie for about an hour longer than I should have.One last thing that deserves praise: the environment that was created seems very much like the 1800s. From the production design to the props to the costumes, this felt like it was taking place during one of America's most difficult times.A bit much, but still good! 7/10",

At no point did I feel I could see what was coming, therefore plenty of suspense throughout and with plenty of dramatic surprises, even if they did sometimes follow the well- trodden Tarantino pattern of violence.If Mr. Tarantino should ever read this review, I have this to say: You made a film that succeeded on plot rather than just violence - maybe you should keep going in that direction, because this was your best film ever.

One of the best and bloodiest westerns ever made. The story is that Tarantino wanted to make a modern spaghetti western and while the music definitely fits this genre, the rest is blockbuster material that the old westerns couldn't touch. The characters have depth, the acting is top-notch and the story is compelling and adventurous, with a healthy dash of humor, some intriguing mind games and a wagon-full of action. It's actually a little funny that it's titled after Django, as his partner (played amazingly by Christopher Waltz) steals most of the scenes and without him the story wouldn't even exist. I'm not really a Tarantino buff, so I can't say how this compares to his other films, but I will say he likes blood - every gunshot caused a fountain to go off. This film got a lot of press for the generous use of the N-word so if that bothers you, steer clear (it's probably uttered evenly between whites and blacks throughout the film).

His unique style of fantastic specifically worded dialogue and impeccably perfect scenes is undoubtedly his trademark along with unusual yet perfectly used soundtracks.As everyone knows its the story of a slave who is freed by a German bounty hunter named Dr king Schultz. Played by waltz who is perfectly cast and a great new actor in Tarentinos bag of actors. Django has a past with a few men whom Schultz is looking for. After he helps Schultz with his task he agrees to help Django rescue his wife. Another great thing about this film and like all qt films is his expert story telling, Tarantino manages to get Oscar caliber performances from every major principal in the film, from star Jamie Foxx to a short lived character of Big Daddy played by Don Johnson.All in all the movie is brutal hilarious exciting from start to finish while it is long at 2 hours and 40 minutes if you ever feel a little bored the payoff is totally worth it",

The rest was taken care of by Jamie Foxx playing Django, a character that transitions from the oppressed to the entertaining to the Badass.What also surprised me was the timeline of the film which was relatively linear, given Tarantino's fondness for messing with the order of events.So the movie begins and Christopher Waltz within minutes convinces you you need to look no further for surprises and fun. Accompanied by him, Django, the freed slave embarks on a journey of Bounty killings until he decides its time to free his wife from slavery. Waltz, realising how dangerous an adventure like this cpuld get offers his guidance and comes up with a plan. It is shown Waltz is fully aware of how difficult it could be to free the woman.They ride together, disguising themselves as dealers of fighter black men. And then do we finally get to meet possibly one of the best movie villains - Leonardo di Caprio as Calvon Candie. He is introduced as an affluent man with devilish fetish of a wrestling game that mostly ends with a death and lots of blood.He does seem intrigued by Django's ways and demeanor, but reserves his approach as Django offers him a plump sum to get one of his wrestlers. And as they ride to his house, the guests get a live show of Candie's personality and business ethics as he punishes one his fighter slaves who tried to elope.All seems to be going merry to the plan, until Candie's pet slave figures out the real scheme of the guests....and that is when Leonardo's character gets to shine. Be it the skull demonstration or the fiery thumping on the table with a thunderous scream...he was instilling fear and accompanied awe every moment.Waltz, pale and later red-faced signs off a new deal offered to have his way out but chooses to not shake hands with Candie. This isn't received well either as Candie takes it as an insult and tries to surrender Waltz into a handshake. So Waltz walks up to him, smiles and does something that leaves us as shocked as Candie. And with the two star characters gone, it dawns upon us that the finale belongs to the character to whom the movie belongs - Django Unchained.What then follows, from his escape to his final revenge reeks with goofiness, but Django's crazy gun skills make us feel he could've actually pulled it off.The end is pretty cliche' but there is no denying it is satisfying. And Tarantino's signature blood baths arrive, albeit late, in full glory.",

It'll take you for a ride, make you laugh, and make you cry, and when you leave the theater, you'll leave with that feeling you get right after you drink six cans of Redbull. That untamed energy that comes power-packed with an uncontrollable force. \"Django Unchained\", an epic tribute to 60's spaghetti westerns, is the tale of, you know it, Django, a slave turned bounty hunter played mercilessly by Jamie Foxx. And when I say mercilessly, know that I mean mercilessly. From galloping on horses to hanging naked in shackles, Foxx did everything Boss Tarantino told him to. Don't get me wrong, Foxx doesn't steal the show. In fact, no one does. Every actor is brilliantly on his or her game. Christoph Waltz is great to watch as Django's rescuer and eventual bounty hunting companion. He plays the part with intriguing types of depth. He's a cool, modernized, and civil guy, who also has been around the block more than a few times. DiCaprio, in one of his best roles, and that's a lot to say when you think about some of the roles he's played in, shines as Calvin Candie, an asshole of a slave plantation owner, who uses manners and plays it cool on the surface, but is a savage and warped sadist on the inside. Even the cameos are great. You have Jonah Hill, as a KKK member in what is surprisingly one of the funniest scenes in a movie all year. You've got Tarantino himself trying to pull off an Aussie accent, but failing miserably, and cracking us up in the meantime. And then you've got Don Johnson, in a semi- cameo, playing another plantation owner who goes by Big Daddy. If you still aren't drooling to see Django, let me write another couple paragraphs on why you should be first in line to buy tickets. \"Django Unchained\" is actually the second installment of a loose-trilogy Tarantino is constructing that centers around revenge and follows the same basic plot line, but with breezy energy and fantastic originality. \"Inglourious Basterds\" was of course the first installment, featuring a band of angry Jews rising up and conquering the Nazis all the way up until Hitler's ugly smudge of a face was shot to smithereens. So, yes, its complete fantasy, but who cares? Why do we go the movies? We go there to be entertained, not for a history lesson. That's what Spike Lee doesn't understand, who condemns the film (Django) before even seeing it, complaining that it \"isn't historically accurate\" and that it's \"offensive to his ancestors.\" Take a hike, man. You're just jealous of a filmmaker who's work is much better, and more importantly, much more consistent that what you produce. I mean, what was your last film, huh Spike? It was \"Red Hook Summer,\" and no one saw it.Finally, let me praise Django as a whole. The acting, writing, directing, production design, cinematography, costume design, and thrilling use of a mix of classic spaghetti western jives and modern mainstream hip hop to make up the film's soundtrack were all explosive and unique to Tarantino's style. I don't care how you see \"Django Unchained,\" but for god's sake, make sure you do. See it in theaters, rent it on DVD (preferably Blu-Ray), or just download it illegally. Just SEE it! See if you can digest this massive epic Tarantino has thrown at us.",

            "content": "Don't get me wrong, I love Quentin Tarantino. I believe he's a very gifted screenwriter and director who comes up with great material back to back to back. Ever since I saw Pulp Fiction I thought that he is the greatest thing to happen to movies and inadvertently forced every movie since to be better and better as people tried to match his genius and quick wit. So when I went to see Django Unchained, his latest opus set in the wild, wild west, I immediately jumped at the chance to see it. I know I had to prepare myself for the gore and the violence that have dominated his movies. Also, I had to prepare to sit through almost 3 long hours (in Unchained's case, 165 minutes) of film. Nowadays, every single movie I see seems to get longer and longer and it's getting harder and harder to sit through them whether it's because the theater seats are uncomfortable, or the audience is restless, or the previews and commercials take about 20 to 30 minutes in addition to having to wait 30 minutes in line to get into the theater so by the time the movie opens my expectations are pretty damn high. Sometimes I have to remind myself what is it that I came to watch in the first place. Now, Django Unchained starts pretty strong actually. And I mean that in a good way. The premise is set early by a group of slaves, chained together, transported through rocky mountains and beautiful, harsh landscapes and guided by two cowboys riding on horseback. We see them walk long days and endless nights for miles on end. Among them is Jamie Foxx as Django, a quiet and beaten down slave who bears the marks of a brutal slashing on his back. Right there, without saying a single word, Quentin has managed to set the mood early on and indicated clearly who is the protagonist of the story. Without a single word, we learn that he's got a hard past, a past that will undoubtedly be revealed later in the film, a past that we are ever so curious to find out. His mission has been accomplished, he's got our attention. Then we're introduced to Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and Quentin's script comes to life. It's a real treat as an aspiring writer and screenwriter to hear such great scripts and Unchained doesn't disappoint in that department. Christoph Waltz, who's been in Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, plays his character with gusto and gives another unforgettable performance. He plays a bounty hunter that talks with such eloquence that you would never believe what he does for a living. Both Django and Dr. Schultz form an unlikely team, he teaches Django to what extend he can stretch his rights as a bounty hunter and a former slave. Django, now a free man thanks to him, has one purpose and one purpose only: to get his wife back. She has been sold to a plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). So far, so good, I'm all ears. The problem begins when Django and Dr. Schultz meet Calvin Candie. Mind you, Leonardo DiCaprio does an excellent job at portraying a man whose ambition and mischievousness can be seen in his eyes. He has finally abandoned his cute boy looks and trade them for those of a man with an evil purpose that can be seen and felt in his performance. However, the problem that I have with the script at this point was the excessive use of the N word. Now I understand that was part the lingo to refer to an African American slave at the time, however it comes a point when the word is heard so many times that it becomes tedious, heavy, almost uncomfortable to hear. In my personal opinion is a matter of taste more than accuracy. There is a difference between being accurate to being offensive, which was Quentin's intention here. Not only is this word uttered countless times in the script by white folk but we also have to hear this from Samuel L. Jackson's character, too. His character, Stephen, far from being compassionate towards Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), is really an ill-tempered curmudgeon that will stop at nothing to see her tortured for trying to escape the plantation that he runs for Calvin. That's not what bothered me about the character as much as his constant use of the N word. Coming from an African American, the word takes on a different meaning and maybe Quentin wrote this purposely to make a point. I could see many in the audience trying not to laugh whenever the word was said on screen, even if it meant to be funny. It made me wonder whether his intention was to entertain an audience or to make them uncomfortable. I believe that the latter was accomplished with Django Unchained.",

            "content": "The \"D\" is silent but this film is far from that. As a QT fan there is to be expected of a higher appraisal for the film but i will try my best to be as blunt and simplistic as a regular attendant of the movies.Django Unchained is brutal, but how is that not expected from a rated \"R\" film and a QT Film to that as well. The first things i would like to touch on are the cons of the film. The first noticeable attribute (to me anyways) was the absence of the recently passed Sally Menke, who has edited close to all QT Films. But the film is still grand in its overall stature. Now, forgive me, for i did say con\"s\" but i really cant seem to think of any more.All of the actors of the film were (as expected) absolutely stunning in their performances. Though Christoph Walts had a stellar performance in Inglorious Basterds, I believe that he will have to compete with the likes of Leo and Sam in this new QT installment, to take another piece of gold at the red carpet. Jamie Foxx as well puts on a good role, better than his past, but that is quite to the thanks of QT's script that gives him all the cool lines.In overall, Django Unchained, In my opinion, is actually a better film than QT's last epic. It is also, a great western, a genre that has been been very hit or miss in the last 20-30 years (with few exception) I highly recommend this film and i myself will be going to see it multiple times. This movie is brutal and can be very intense, but this is Oscar worthy at its best.And one more note, on the recent developments of the retarded people criticizing the movie (without even seeing it.) For its so called use of bad taste for black people is simply not true. If anything, this movie makes fun of dumb white people more than the blacks. half the white people in the movie don't know how to speak English!

The film tackles serious themes such as slavery, revenge, and the search for freedom, but does so with a bold and irreverent tone that sets it apart from other films in the genre. The film's soundtrack is also brilliant, featuring an eclectic mix of classic western themes and contemporary tracks that perfectly complement the film's style and tone.

            "content": "The acting was amazing in this movie. Jamie Foxx does a great job playing Django a slave that with the help of Dr. King Schultz played by Christoph Waltz, is trying to find and save his wife from Calvin Candie played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Broomhilda, Django's wife played by Kerry Washington does a good job as the damsel in distress. She doesn't have a lot of dialogue in the film but she did a fine job acting and really made her scenes count. I think one of the most interesting aspects of the movie is motivation behind Dr. Schultz on one hand he is a bounty hunter and the other he is also against slavery. Throughout the movie I kept asking myself if I was in that situation what would I do? I don't think it is fair to the people who had to experience slavery first hand to know exactly what I would do, but I think this movie forces you to question your own morals about the situations Django finds himself in. Calvin Candie's right hand man in this film and a key antagonist is Stephen played by Samuel L. Jackson. Another interesting relationship is that between Stephen and Django both hold significant power despite being African American and comparing the two is very interesting considering the time period and their roles in society.A major part of this movie was the violence that was prevalent throughout the movie. When I was first watching this movie I thought at some points the violence was excessive and not with purpose. With that being said after watching this movie I feel as the thought the violence is more and more warranted. The more I think about why the violence occurs the more I am OK with the violence. There is no mistaking this movie is a hard R rated and is quite violent. I encourage you to see this movie and decide for yourself if the violence was warranted. The writing was amazing in this film, as this is nothing unusual with a Quentin Tarantino movie. I thought the dialogue was well written and really added a great element to the movie. I really like how this movie looked at some very potent issues of race, killing, and what is \"ok\". There were certain instances where I feel it might have been a little bit too violent or in excess. This doesn't change the fact that this is a movie that looks at hard questions, and let you decide the answers. I really enjoyed Django Unchained and highly recommend it.",

The characters are shaped in Quentin's own way. I was confused in a scene of Mr. Dicaprio. His hand started to bleed out of nowhere.

The music score was absolutely a train wreck, quickly changing from rap to some horrible Elvis 70's clone song. I also didn't like the insinuation that all white people were evil slave holders and Jamie Foxx was the black superhero avenging slaves by killing every white person he came across. Again, it's OK to hate Caucasian folks, but anything else is racist. The ONLY good thing about this movie, was Tarantino's use of \"Two mules for sister Sarah\", a song from an old Eastwood western.

Dr. Schultz has no stomach for slavery or slave owners. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't enter the film until the second part.Like Tarantino films it incorporates humor. The bag over the head scene was reminiscent of something we might have seen in \"Blazing Saddles.\" The flashbacks are minimal and not confusing. There is of course the over the top climatic ending and plenty of blood.I have to question the use of the MF bomb several times in this picture. The first known usage of the word is the 1930s. It is speculated the phrase originated during slavery as a way to describe white owners who would take black mothers as comfort women. The phrase would have a specific meaning and not used in the generic sense that Samuel L. Jackson tossed about.Tarantino fans will not be disappointed.

            "content": "As someone who was introduced to the films of Quentin Tarantino in the 2000s with Kill Bill, I have always been more familiar with the indulgent fanboy side of him. For a time during his post-Jackie Brown hiatus, many believed his next work would be something even more low-key and maybe even profound. But all he has done since is lower expectations with increasingly violent homages to cult sub-sub-genres of movies he grew up with, even indirectly remaking two of his favourites, as part of a Spaghetti Western trilogy: 'Inglourious Basterds' and now this, a loose remake/homage to the 1966 Spaghetti Western 'Django' starring Franco Nero, who features in a cameo here. It begins with the slave Django being unchained by German-born bounty hunter 'Dr' King Schultz. A giant tooth wiggles atop Schultz's carriage impertinently throughout the picture, though unusually for a Tarantino flic', he at no point performs any impromptu dentistry on the crackers and rednecks he's gunning for. Schultz promises to free Django from slavery upon collecting several bounties across the Deep South and then repay him by taking down Francophile plantation owner Calvin Candie (played with devilish menace by Leonardo DiCaprio) of Candyland and above all, rescuing Django's conveniently German-speaking wife Brunhilde.Jamie Foxx relishes executing every evil white man, reminiscent of every Fred Williamson blaxploitation character while Christoph Waltz gets to take off the Nazi uniform from his last QT collaboration and play the guilty-ass white man. He is the most interesting and complex of all the characters herein (though that may not be saying much) as his arc of development reflects that of the European-American. He deals with his guilt at not having done enough in the latter half of the movie when he witnesses a slave's tearing apart by dogs and one Mandingo warrior gouge out another's eyes for the pleasure of 'Monsieur' Candie.As with all Tarantini, revenge is served with bombastic effect. If there is anything unconventional in the violence of the movie it is the disproportionate meting out of cruelty to the slaveholders and Uncle Toms, who only receive gunshots to the heart or unceremonious kneecappings while innocent slaves are mauled, gouged of their eyes and beaten with hammers or robbed of dignity in the aforementioned Mandingo fights and of course, their heritage. Perhaps this is Quentin's way of reminding us his stories take place in unjust worlds not unlike the ones we live in.Unlike most blaxploitation pictures set in the era, the slaves of the movie are only freed after being bought with money by a white man and this is why it could be argued it is a blaxploitation movie for white audiences, coming to terms with the history of racial oppression in the US and a new era where the 'minorities' of yesteryear collectively comprise the majority but the white plurality is rapidly becoming marginalized politically. Blood splatters white lilies, cotton, and snow to remind us why white America got where it is. A black-n-white President may symbolize the transitional phase the county is in but the transformation has not yet been realised. The debt owed by many Americans is not merely a monetary one.Although after pondering these issues, the film proceeds for another half-hour wherein any remaining do-badders are riddled with bullets or blown apart by dynamite in a fairly unimaginative and convoluted way. Watching the weak climax one longs for the return of Sally Menke's guiding hand guiding a pair of scissors over the 2:15 mark and graciously snipping it loose. QT is definitely missing that woman's touch dearly: those scenes deleted could have made excellent DVD material.As a genre film however, it is an excellent meshing of two deeply entrenched yet juxtaposed American icons: the cowboy and the slave. The former symbolizing America's unity and freedom after the Civil War somehow entwined with one representing America's division (then between North and South; a century later, between largely urban and rural) and tyranny. In a movie ending on the eve of the Civil War, the future and the past. Hip hop music is played to the desired startling effect over images of Django's horse seemingly strutting him into the Candyland plantation but everything else has been seen before in one form or another.It must sully the memories of cineastes who were once so electrified by the jarring chords of the Miserloo nineteen years ago and the overnight globalisation of that treasured American epithet, Motherf*cker, to see what little Quentin Tarantino has done to show he's learnt anything since. Postmodernist masturbation may be enough for audiences these days who disregard 'elitist' critics and their analyses but if this is the case our filmmakers should unchain their own minds and emancipate viewers worldwide with a cinema of meaning.",

Every movie he makes its a truly pleasure to watch, in every detail, from the music, to the camera shots, the dialogs, the acting, everything. Django Unchained is no exception. It is fun, enjoyable, and though long, it never gets boring.What I did miss, however, was some of the more intricate plot lines of other Tarantino movies such as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, or Inglorious Bastards. Tarantino does seem to enjoy making Westerns, judging by the fact he is now doing another one. And the genre definitely allows for the spectacular bloodshed he so enjoys filming. But the story of Django misses the dramatic unraveling of events that is so enjoyable about Tarantino, it is quite straightforward and the good and bad guys are very easy to identify, and sometimes the plot line gets very predictable (even though Tarantino has the talent to make even a predictable storyline to be enjoyable to watch; the devil is in the details)When the movie had just come out, there was a lot of fuss about the use of the n-word. Even for me, that I am not American, it gets pretty disturbing and uncomfortable. I don't have anything to say about the race issues with this movie that has not been said before, but I can totally understand how people got mad about it. Race and slavery are such sensitive issues, that a white person must be very careful to not make it a racist movie, even if the intentions are completely the opposite, as it is clear here. There is virtually no white American who is a white guy in this movie, and it is clear that Tarantino himself is not a racist. But once again, the devil is in the details.All of this criticism should not make it seem like it is a bad movie. At all. It is definitely something you don't see everyday in Cinemas. Tarantino is definitely one of the best American directors alive, and chances are that whatever other movie you find on cable one night, will probably be worse than Django Unchained.",

All the actors do their job very well, but it's not the actors that write the story or the script. DeCaprio does very well as a Southern slave owner - very sly and deceitful. Jamie Fox does very well at getting revenge and shooting people. Several times in the film he has to just sit & bite his tongue until he gets his chance.

On the surface, Django is just a hodgepodge of celebrity cameos, gratuitous violence, and crowd-pleasing one-liners; but my appreciation for the movie goes beyond the way I would appreciate something like MIB3.Other reviewers have touched on the fact that this film is very much a production of two (or three) acts. For the most part, the first half of the movie could easily be labeled as a fun, buddy flick. The second half, however, possesses the sort of uncanny, awkward tension that is quintessentially \"Tarantino.\" Tarantino is probably most famous for his use of gratuitous violence, but I think he's at his best when the violence is bubbling just below the surface: the restaurant robbery scene in Pulp Fiction, the opening scene in Basterds, and the whole Bill encounter in Vol. 2 to name a few examples. Obviously, most of these scenes end in violence-- as is the case when Tarantino uses the same device in Django--, but the actual violence doesn't define any of his movies. Tarantino's ability to string his audience along in a state of suspended anticipation is his true trademark, in my opinion.Tarantino is at his suspenseful best in the second half of Django, and, as enjoyable as Jonah Hill's cameo and other fun moments were, the delicate dialog is what I will look forward to when I eventually see it again. Basterds is still my favorite Tarantino flick, but Django convincingly throws its name in the ring. This is a must-see movie.P.S. Tarantino's cameo is truly awful.",

The great cast, the super storyline and the slightly silly but practical humor keeps you wanting to watch more of this movie.The cast I personally thought was wonderful especially Cristopher waltz Performance as the German dentist I thought stole the movie. The humor was very well written although of cos some might not notice it like I did at the very beginning of the film but as you get to the end it's a non stop laughing festival.The hair and make up was wonderful as Samuel l Jackson might not be recognized by a few.the setting of the film also I thought was exceptional as it gives you a sense of darkness and cruelty but at the same time it's easy and not overdone.To sum up, django unchained was a great film with a few flaws such as a few unnecessary scenes that make the film a bit too long and also something that should have been reduced is the blood and gore that is visible when someone is shot, as it makes you want to vomit. But still it's a very watchable film that deserves it's Oscars.",

            "review_title": "\"Django\" is the Best of 2012!",
            "content": "\"Django Unchained\" is without a doubt the best film of 2012, a slick, sharp-tongued, bloody action epic that has Quentin Tarantino's fingerprints all over every smartly homaged frame. Smart dialogue, an incredible soundtrack, and more blood than all the horror flicks of 2012 combined are what usually make Tarantino's films so indulgently fantastic, the kind of movies that real movie-lovers love. And that's all here, with a double check on the amount of blood as Django teams up with a Dr. Schulz to rescue his wife from the hands of a mad man, and violently exacts vengeance on her captors. But Tarantino's films have also always featured strong, wonderfully defined performances, and there's no shortage here. Jamie Foxx as the vengeance-seeking Django, Christoph Waltz as the dentist-turned-bounty-hunter King Schultz, Leonardo DiCaprio as the violently eccentric plantation owner Calvin Candie, Kerry Washington as Django's lost love, and Samuel L. Jackson in a scene-stealing performance as Steven, Candie's right-hand man. That only Waltz managed to get Oscar's attention is a travesty. I would have given a nomination to Foxx, DiCaprio and Jackson as well, if I had the choice. Unfortunately, I don't. An incredible host of famous faces rounds out the epic cast, including a bit part by a lazy-eyed Jonah Hill and a hilariously explosive cameo by the director himself. Don't like Westerns, you say? This will be your exception, as it both affirms and breaks the sacred and longstanding rules of the genre, and throws in some new elements to redefine and reinvigorate (an Oscar-worthy original rap song, for instance). At 165 minutes, the film seems to be reaching a ridiculously violent climax during a shoot-out for the ages, but Tarantino is only beginning to turn on the heat at this point, and the ending will have you boiling over with excitement.-Thomas Bond",

Shocking juxtaposition of cruelty and comedy, frequently within scenes, created a particularly effective mood whiplash. True to form, much style is drawn from the director's love of homage; this time from the Spaghetti Western, he brings the visual intensity of stunning landscapes, and a memorable soundtrack, whilst indulging in the exquisite interiors and costumes of the period.",

I have not seen much western or spaghetti western movies.Way to start with great style of this movie. The actor i liked the most is Christoph Waltz. I think it is one of the greatest performances. His acting,style and every dialogue is so incredible. Especially i liked that part most when he kills a criminal in front of everyone and convince others that the criminal had it coming with his hands behind his head. The most sophisticated doctor and bounty hunter i have ever seen in any movie. He deserved the Academy award for Best Supporting Actor more than anyone. About our lead character Django played by Jamie Foxx,He is also very good. The great apprentice played by a Academy Award winner really well. Samuel.L Jackson,amazing like always. This time he played a eccentric black old man who ,Ironically does not like black men. Kerry Washington shows the real damsel-in-distress scenes and she is too good. Leonardo Dicaprio is mind blowing especially in the table sequence where his hand actually bled after he got hurt by hitting the glass too hard,He stayed in the character and it was so original,He is a great actor. I really loved the KKK styled attack Big Daddy's man planned on Dr and Django. It was real Tarantino style how they fight and talk.Tarantino always give surprises and he never miss to entertain us. Like all his previous movies,this has also clever dialogues and script. In the face of Western flick. The theme of slavery he chose is app-laudable,but i think involved the use of n-word far more times but as we all know our classic director, he is never wrong about swearing. The cameo of Tarnatino himself and old Django are impressive. Overall ,this movie is entertaining and outstanding.",

The pacing is really odd throughout the entire movie in my opinion. The plot gets sidetracked or takes too long to move on multiple times. Also, there are some strange transitions (scrolling text in order to fast forward months in time? Really?) and shots of characters slowly approaching a location which should've been cut down so we could just get on with it. \"Jerky\" is how I'd describe the pacing in one word.My big beef was that while I like Tarantino, he seriously needs to dial it back a bit on some of his signature techniques. They must've went through a thousand blood packets in this movie it was just ridiculous. I like violent movies but all the blood became egregious and without a point, and no this wasn't filmed in a Kill Bill sort of way. Also the general gruesome violence shown was too much. The whipping and the branding, okay I can hack that, but the two slaves wrestling to the death while DiCaprio hoots and hollers was a sick joke. It goes on for 2-4 solid minutes of uncomfortable screen time, with shots that could've been easily cut out and we would've still gotten the point. Yes I understand that this is our history and sometimes you have to force yourself to look, but the movie features the N-word throughout and it's obvious that almost every white character looks at black people as their property to use and abuse as they please. We get it, it's clear as day, you don't have to subject the audience to something so unsettling when you've already made your point. Lastly as others have said Tarantino needs to stop putting himself in these films. You're sucked in to a movie and then he shows up and takes you right out of it. It was cute once or twice, now please stop for the sake of your own work.The performances were very good and that's what held it all together for me despite my complaints above. DiCaprio stole the show in my opinion, though I think he could've been given even better lines/calls to action. To be honest if the movie was about him I think it would've been just as good if not better. Everyone else was above average to be sure so all in all it was a really good cast.I think as a whole the movie is kind of a mish mash but the characters are fairly vibrant and the performances vault it into \"good\" territory. I know I typed more about the bad than the good but again I enjoyed what the actors turned out in this one very much, which more than made up for what I felt was a jagged script.",

            "content": "A Merry Django Christmas to all! The 10:00 AM Christmas morning premier of Django Unchained at a very large suburban Baltimore AMC Multiplex cinema was sold out. Not to worry, there is plenty more of Django to go around. Quentin Tarantino has given us the gift that keeps on giving. I believe that this was the first movie where I walked away wishing that I could read the book it was based upon. This will not happen anytime soon unless director/writer Quentin Tarantino releases Django Unchained as a novel. This story is not a remake of the 1966 \"spaghetti western\", Django starring Franco Nero. But I digress. Pulp Fiction thrilled most viewers, discounting the folks that showed up for Travolta's return to the big screen and found Tarantino a little too rich for their blood. Some of us rushed to see Reservoir Dogs and found our second Tarantino dish was a little rich for our taste. Moving on, I was first in line to see Jackie Brown. The umpire called a strike two on Quentin. Holy cow! And then along comes Kill Bill who knocks it out of the park. One more year and Kill Bill II would finish the set in fine fashion. Inglorious Basterds, the movie that changed so many spell checkers, was an anomaly. Quentin had the chutzpah to change history. Not everyone liked the fact that Quentin took the license to kill Adolph Hitler in this movie. By this time, I was swilling the Kool-Aid and let Tarantino drive the car. Django Unchained is more of the same, except better. The movie is funny, violent, profane, and remains true to the real evil slave-tender, i.e. the American history that sanctioned slavery. No need to make up any additional drama when it comes to a society that permits slavery. I counted (this is not official mind you) 66 times when the \"N\" word is dropped. This is perhaps the most wicked word in our vocabulary, and it is used with an excessiveness to remind us that the slavery-devil was calling the shots in 1858. Quentin drops Don Johnson into this story playing a wicked Tennessee plantation owner. Johnson is the trump card that QT holds with most of his movies. The question is, \"which tried and true actor is going to get a chance to let the public see them in the sunshine again\"? Don Johnson is the winner of this role in Django. Christoph Waltz, a brilliant actor who had faded from Hollywood (and is another spell- checker destroyer) won the Oscar for his role in Inglorious Basterds. Kurt Russell, David Carradine, and John Travolta showed their fans that they had plenty of stuff left in their tanks. (David Carradine' s tank was officially emptied with his passing) The movie shows off the hard work that is synonymous with Tarantino movies. The clip of Waltz and Foxx riding their horses in a couple of feet of fresh snow in poor lighting feels like a segment that the crew worked too hard to edit out of the movie. That's just my guess. Django Unchained gets a lot of the silliness out of the way early, and allows the stars, Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Samuel Jackson to do what they do best. Act. And act they do. Please pick your favorite roll after seeing the movie. None will disappoint. Samuel Jackson may be the most \"out of character\" as a despicable employee of DiCaprio. Leonardo scene with the skull of \"old Ben\" is one of his best ever. As he slams his hand on the table, I only wonder if the resulting laceration was on purpose. Did Tarantino let the camera roll and capture the moment as the thespian plied his skill? I am a sucker for a director who has a list of actors that show up again and again in his movies. Tarantino's cast for Django is almost as large as the characters of the Bible. He pays respect to Franco Nero, the original Django. Michael Parks delivers the goods as always. Quentin's does a bang up job in his role as an Aussie. Simply put, Quentin does a bang up job with his gift of Django Unchained. Next: Kill Bill 3.",

            "content": "A story of revenge, devotion, faith, aspirations, and sadism, relentless tragic indigestible sadism. What can I say about Tarantino that has not been said before? I will not chuck more wood into his already flaming fire; I will instead talk about the symbolism and plot of this movie: A charismatic and cultured foreigner in 1858 Texas had to be the one to bestow Django (Jamie Foxx) with a chance to challenge all the odds and save his wife from slavery in a plantation in Mississippi. Progressively both characters develop a friendship that will even position Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) in danger while attempting a heroic.The movie explores themes like sacrifice, acceptance, love, union, solidarity, betrayal. The scenes elucidate excellently the unbearable nature of the life for slaves; it is difficult to even glance at some scenes and ascertain the phenomenology of the slaves: the circumstances they endured. Few contemporary movies have tried to give us a detailed rendition of the phenomenology of slaves: 12 years as a slave, Harriet, Mudbound, come to mind. Django pushes our sensibilities and attempts to expand our understanding of the sadism and unjust reality that slaves were forced to endure. Extraordinary imaginative effort would be required to dimension the magnitude of their suffering without works of art like this one.The story of the wise man and the apprentice begins when Dr Schultz starts to make deals with Django to hunt criminals. Django learns lessons and skills that will, ultimately, allow him to face the biggest challenge he has had in his life, remain calm in the biggest storm he has ever experienced. He learns how to suppress his instincts and emotions to be able to receive criticism even from a black person being excessively servile to white people.Maybe revenge was not the best dish, but it paints a picture of drama and tragedy very emblematic in Tarantino's films. It also serves to amplify the passions of many of the characters that give absolutely outstanding performances: Calvin Candle (Leonardo DiCaprio), Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), and Broomhilda (Kery Washington). I'd like to highlight DiCaprio's performance as one of the best ones I have seen from him. His ability to go from 0-100 and make his character believable and simultaneously terrifying is masterful feature of this film that gets under-appreciated. His dialogue and antics are a highlight of the movie.Django had to pay the ultimate sacrifice for Broomhilda, but it was a sacrifice he was willing to make from the beginning of the movie. Despite all the immorality, sadism, hate, ignorance, and irreverence we see a gesture of sacrifice born out of care and love. It is rare to see Tarantino explore these topics, but it was beautifully displayed in the reencounter of Broomhilda and Django.",

With the controversy adding more on top of the hype it was one movie I just couldn't miss. I was a bit iffy on the the main casting choice,of Jamie Foxx, but boy did he deliver. Christoph Waltz gives another sensational performance, I loved him in Inglorious and Tarantino wrote the part of Dr. King Schultz specifically for him. DiCaprio was sensational and he played the villain exceptionally. Django has something that extra that makes this movie arguably the best Tarantino movie. I think that it is definitely the best Tarantino movie since Pulp Fiction, but some people may argue that it surpasses Pulp Fiction, and that is a very hard thing to do.

And I couldn't tell his age by seeing a photo of him, but by watching this, his last movie, Django. The experience of watching the whole movie left me with a somewhat dull impression. Quentin Taratino didn't change the instruments, which made him and his past movies such an outstanding work. The acting is really well done, wisely he chose, Don Johnson, Christoph Waltz, Jamiee Foxx, etc, etc. They set every tagline with its ironic undertone, just so uninspired, most of us would expect this. the massive use of the N-Word as a didactic example for dysphemism. Massive gun shooting scenes, blood everywhere, a cool soundtrack, all-you-can-eat. However, at the end, what is Django? A rude movie, with vile language, a bunch of well known actors, and a trivial story, the worn-out arsenal of the really great Quentin Tarantino? the wagon, once rushing, just stopped due overload, or someone forgot to fuel it with fresh coal. As attempt of redemption this movie really sucks, Jamie Foxx shots down every stereotype on his clownish crusade, if not Mr.Waltz had done it already. naive jokes are eroding any absurdity of real slavery in history.

Once done, Shultz trains Django and they partner up through the winter to finally end up at plantation owner Calvin Candie's (Lenardo DiCaprio) candy land in search of Django's wife Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington).Set in the year 1858, Quentin Tarantino depicts an America where black slavery is prominent throughout society and Django in his pretty clothes, riding a horse stands out like an anomaly that lead to a few loosely put together plots and the banter throughout the film. That and what seemed like sloppy editing (made worse by censorship) now and then made the film lack any sense of direction. Compared to some of the other Tarantino films, this one lacked the finesse that you'd come expect from him. Jamie Foxx as the protagonist does a fantastic job as he transforms from a nervous slave to a fearless bounty hunter but lacks the screen presence when surrounded by other actors. Christoph Waltz not only supersedes him with his extraordinary acting but even his character seemed less modulated and worth immersing yourself into.Lenardo DiCaprio is amusingly eccentric and unhinged delivering yet another top notch performance while Samuel L. Jackson as Candie's adviser Stephen was literally a mishmash of stereotypes blurting out one line profanities as you'd expect from a grumpy old man. Kerry Washington is decent but doesn't really impress. Support and cameos from Walton Goggins, James Rema, Don Johnson, Jonah Hill etc was a mix bag of wasted screen time and necessary plot points.Django Unchained never got boring. In fact is was a lot of fun to watch and was extremely entertaining. Problem was all of it didn't always fall into place which took the wind out of the sail for me.

Samuel Jackson plays his role as a head house slave with uncommon and malignant loyalty to his master very well.But that stupid gunfight at the end? Bodies flying everywhere and blood splattering all over the place? And going back to the house to exact revenge and blowing it to smithereens with dynamite? Really - come on! This is as puerile as it gets. Tarantino is irresponsible and immature and sets a poor example by exorcising his inferiorities on celluloid.The real dynamic of this movie, and one that is sadly betrayed by the movie's stupid denouement is the friendly relationship of mutual understanding and respect between Dr. King Schultz and Django. This was the heartbeat of the movie and a delicate one which added magic to the story and that should've played out to the very end, whereas it was crushed by Tarantino's narrow-minded, passive-aggressive approach to life.Boo to Tarantino.

Unchanged has everything you would want from Tarantino: dynamic and defined characters, witty yet natural dialogue, and of course some bloody (literally) awesome action scenes.As for acting I was very impressed with the whole cast. Foxx has given his best performance since Ray, and managed to hold his own against waltz. Foxx also contributed his comedic talents (complimenting the comic relief in Waltz) to Django, which would have otherwise made the film drag. Waltz was fantastic as always and really helped carry the first half of the film. His comedic role was a shock after seeing him as \"The Jew Hunter\" in inglorious Bastards, which shows Waltz's versatility. Leonardo DiCaprio was the biggest surprise, (also his best performance ever in my opinion) he was excellent as a cruel slave master that was genuinely terrifying and realistic. Sam Jackson added a nice minor performance as the Stockholm syndrome sufferer and deprived servant to Leo. Kerry Washington had a brief yet poignant role as Django's suffering wife, and shared some great scenes with Waltz. The cinematography was a standout in this film. Robert Richardson beautifully captured the landscape of the south, featuring beautiful sunsets and mountain ranges. The costume design was also excellent, especially the many three piece suits of Walz and DiCaprio. As far as soundtrack Tarantino does an excellent job blending genres, time periods and score like no other director could. As far as direction Tarantino has classic nods to the western genre. His use of Zoom and sound effects are a homage to the classic t.v. shows of the 60's. Tarantino once again is able to use tension building camera angles (think Inglorious Bastards opening credits). Tarantino really does show his talent for directing action scenes in particular. The only criticism about Django was one particular scene which felt like a cut away from a family guy episode, this scene stood out to me. Not that this moment was not hilarious, but it felt out of place with the perfect dark comedy that accompanied the rest of the film. Overall Django is another excellent film added to Tarantino's collection. It had the great dialogue, soundtrack, acting, and action that you would expect from one of the best working directors today.",

He is such an enlightened, bad-ass black man that my poor senses were left in clanging cacophony by his repulsive fawning.

The best way to describe it is \"Sergio Leone meets Quentin Tarantino meets 50 cents\", though the spaghetti comes with a liberal spattering of red sauce, the western is served with a heavy dose of southern bigotry, and hey \u2013 why not throw in a little bit of rapping??!.This is a story of love, slavery and bounty hunters in the wild west - interrupted only by a \"Blazing Saddles\" type skit which nails the vacuous and ridiculous Ku Klux Klan to their own burning cross in hilarious fashion.For all their immense acting talents Leonardi DeCaprio (Calvin Candie, an egocentric and opportunistic cotton plantation owner) and Samuel L Johnson (the obsequious servant Stephen) are reduced to mere bit players as first Christopher Waltz (bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz) and then Jamie Foxx (main character Django) hold centre stage with their single minded pursuit of their goals.There are some unique and memorable moments in \"Django Unchained\", much to take in as your senses are assaulted by gun-slinging slave traders and their complicit \"aristocratic\" buyers, the plight of the unfortunate slaves themselves, and the twists and turns that befall our bounty hunter, and his self-proclaimed (albeit oxymoronic) \"free slave\".I loved this film as a form of escapism, and I'm not sure there is a better way to enjoy Tarantino's unique and formidable talents.",

            "content": "Story: a slave is recruited by a bounty hunter to help them identify three brothers whom they seeking. The two become friends and decide to release and Django's wife. A simple story, without dramatic twists, but interesting and flour, a gunmen story told in Tarantino style.Director: Quentin Tarantino is definitely a genius. There are four types of directors: those who did not know what to do (Bigelow), who patiently teaches school and apply what they have learned (Affleck), directors who have expectations from the public (Bergman, Tarkovsky, Kubrick) and those who it is really good entertainer's that attract public attention at any level of funny ideas that have crossed my mind (Burton, Tarantino, Hitchcock). Tarantino denies not this time either, and his style very attentive to detail, and the story offers players a chance to be experienced by those who see the film at its peak. If you're a fan Tarantino, Django Unchained will notice that only violence is as important as in Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction, but if this will fail, you're an idiot who looks at Tarantino just because it's cool to do that and you have never understood any of his movies. If you think Tarantino has no balls this time just because someone does not cut in two as in Kill Bill, depression and keeps you look at Ninja Assassins, that movie is for you. If you think of the dialogs are not as sparkling and memorable as Pulp Fiction, my friendly advice is to forget yourself again to Django and if not then you do not rifle anything, then resume all his movies or read their scenarios. If after this exercise you no bulb lights cut off the list and gives a dislike Tarantino fans on face book page Quentin. Anyway you idiot, with or without chest badge Tarantino fan. Directed alert, smart cameras capture and contain just the right amount Django universe to give you a sense of the heroic world, actors feel free and this is seen very clearly in their game. The special effects are cool, delicious, shooting geysers of blood provokes sufficient melodramatic as to seem funny and appropriate.Scenario: It is true that the story is pretty simple, does not have twists is quite predictable but it is clear, following spaghetti Westerns. But that story does not live up to Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs's's not reason enough to be considered stupid. Instead, the story is smooth, it makes sense, do not get bored and do not abuse the extraordinary circumstances in which the hero leaves unscathed stupid as cheap movies, although it is recognized weakness of Tarantino films Category B. Dialogues: brilliant! You wake up laughing and patting with hands on belly. The more I have not laughed that hard at a movie. Tarantino gathers a lot of American stereotypes that still stand today and in American culture, and mocks them in style. You do not break up laughing at lines like: D'Artagnan mother f****r! Soft hearted or Frency? Alexandre Dumas is black! Gentleman times, you had my curiosity, now you have my attention. If you can not find a monologue like the one in Pulp Fiction, Samuel L. Jackson held does not mean that Django is weak or stupid, but you're malicious and that you have nothing to do with Tarantino universe. Characters: Django - Western standard-sized main character: gunslinger born, smarter and with big balls. Dr. King Schultz - character funny, slick, mentor and who must die at some point as to raise awareness. Calvin Candie - the bad boy who wants to be smart, it's bad to the bone, cruel and has no way to not do s*** when the time arises. The characters are cool, fun, fantastic, get attached to them, whether bad or good. As usual, Tarantino's characters are colorful, special and put into the frame. Dumas's heroes are like, Lesage or Rabelais: Indecent trend has become universal and representative of an era due to their exaggerated. Actors: if you have not noticed DiCaprio in the film is that you slept. When cut on his hand after he betrays the two bounty hunters, was not in the script, like blood smudging his wife's face Django, but Tarantino insisted that DiCaprio will continue and it makes phenomenal . Again Waltz gives a lesson in acting and discipline, Vienna's Burgtheater thick it flows through your veins, maybe there comes to view related DiCaprio's lack of professionalism. Samuel L. Jackson is the role of the old man killer Stephen and I think that out of that minor character maximum. The only one who does not live up to all the other actors are Jamie Foxx. It seems that there may be more. Soundtrack: awesome! Worth buying. Especially the special edition they do not appear RZA's \"singing\" or who speaks there. Morricone and his column appears so ... Impact: chance to become cult and his other films. Definitely deserves a place in my film library. I do not know how many awards will, I'm sure will catch some of them, but not see him taking the Oscar for Best Picture, not as long as the competition are films such as Argo and Lincoln and the jury is chaired by the Americans.

Tarantino is a smart director and shoots around the stone faced Foxx but you can't shoot around the lead of a movie all the time and because of that the movie is a poorer film. I remember watching the first half of this film thinking that Hollywood needs to make a real movie about slavery because it is an untapped well of emotion and human interest that will produce AMAZING movies if done right. Why couldn't Tarantino just make a movie about slavery? This was just a revenge story set during slavery times.Anyway this movie dragged on until Sam Jackson came into the picture and literally saved it. Almost single handedly saved it from being a sleeper of a picture. His energy woke up Leonardo DiCaprio who didn't start really act until Sam came into the picture. Sam and Leonardo played off each other so well. Loved it. However Sam Jackson's energy wasn't enough to wake up stone faced Foxx. That man just can not act. Why is he an actor? Someone please tell me!Christoph Waltz was in this movie and he did an okay job. I think he won an award for his role in this movie but he wasn't anything special.

            "content": "Being a movie buff, I was well acquainted with Quentin Tarantino for his master-work in two exquisite projects Pulp Fiction (1994) Inglorious Basterds (2009). That is why I was more eager than usual for watching his 2012 movie, Django Unchained starring Christoph Waltz, Jamie Fox & Leonardo DiCaprio in lead roles. The title comes from Django, 1966 western drama starring Franco Nero who happens to make a remarkable cameo in Django Unchained. The horror that Django Unchained expresses isn't of slavery, but of a filmmaker attempting historical but a entertaining endeavor while shackled by his own superior persona.Tarantino found an appropriate channel to exhibit aggression & violence in a dramatic manner. The plot is set up in the year 1958 post Civil War where black negroes were traded, enslaved and tortured in return of money. The opening sequence depicts two brothers Ace Speck & Dicky Speck with several chained Negro slaves being taken to a place somewhere in Texas. Among those slaves is Django, the slave who is determined to save his wife Broomhilda who is being separated from him during an auction. The Speck brothers during their travel are interrupted by a dentist turned bounty hunter Dr King Schultz (Waltz) who offers to buy Django from the Speck brothers but ends up shooting one & injuring other severely since they refuse to initiate the sale & Django gets unchained.Schultz offers Django complete freedom if he identifies the Brittle brothers whom Schultz, being a bounty hunter is required to kill. It somehow happens that Django has the ability to recognize the Brittle brothers as he had worked in their plantations before being auctioned to wilderness. The two go on bounty hunting rampage when finally Schultz gets so enamored to Django that he offers to aid him in his search to rescue Broomhilda. There is more to Django than just a bounty hunter's right hand. Django has forbidden love for his wife which he restricts from reflecting on his face as he has Broomhilda on his mind even after being separated from her. Cinematically Tarantino has represented it rather beautifully. The underlying soul of the film is that the freedman Django & the hit-man Schultz are pitted against Calvin Candie, the owner of Candyland plantation & his butcher Stephen to save Broomhilda who is working as a slave in Candyland. The violence is outsize and enormous but not disturbing and Tarantino has successfully created a niche to showcase on screen violence with several blood splashing & spilling scenes. The action sequences are blood, gore & comedy-rolled together thus keeping us entertained all the way. Christoph waltz ought to get thumbs up for playing a scrupulous, lethal & politely taunting bounty hunter. Even the role of antagonist Calvin Candie is played beautifully by DiCaprio as he succeeds to look both well-mannered as well as purely evil displaying sheer splendor & ability. 'Django Unchained' is 165 minutes long and is filled with moments of agonizing & teased out action and surprises in casting as well as the story. Some people may have criticized the director on how racist the film happens to be but if you still throughout the film; you can discover plenty of scenes for the audience to engage in. The world created by Tarantino in film is not just of misery and pain but one having sarcasm, racism, extreme violence and reprehensible people.",

The bounty hunter wanted Django to identify his targets, while Django was happy to be free with him than be slaved by any white man.On their trail of collecting bounties, Django learns to shoot and actively assist the German bounty hunter. The way Django develops his character and the flamboyance of the German bounty hunter, is artistically portrayed.The story proceeds by Django explaining his friend that he has a slave wife and he wants to find her. On their trail to find his wife, the movie takes the most exciting turn by far! And that too very late by Tarantino's movie standards. The Candy-land experience and what follows provides this movie the oomph, which till then was missing. However, DiCaprio does his magic once again by playing the feudal lord of Candy Land where Django's slave wife is working. What follows is what Tarantino is best known for. A lot of blood and action!

For me, the stand out performance was Christoph Waltz as Dr Schultz. The juxtaposition between Schultz's gentlemanly demeanour and his violent vocation is brilliant. In fact, the whole film plays on this apparent contradiction between respectability and brutality - for example the horrific sport of 'Mandingo' (basically cock-fighting with slaves instead of hens...) being played in a beautiful, expensive parlour and enjoyed by 'gentlemen'. The constant blending of these ideas meant that I was continually surprised and utterly engrossed.I won't deny that the the subject matter is uncomfortable, and I'm still not sure how I feel about Tarantino's morality when it comes to slavery, violence and revenge.

There is one fact about Tarantino that I like : his way of directing in terms of image, music,scenery is clearly already in his head way before the cameras is ready for rollin'.He has indeed a very good vision of what he wants, but that is not enough to make a good movie.Let me compare this to f.i. most of the Coen movies and more precise f.i. No country for old men : good pacing,hooks,no music at all,acting perfect,visual very good,witty,humor,action OK,but more over with these characters you feel connected.

The script is what you expect from Quentin Tarantino. Violent, funny and clever. There is some truly funny moments in the film which is great to see. Although some of them are truly un-PC.

That completely different to the cartoon violence that we are used to in his usual films and also the rest of the film. The two types that are depicted are quite contradicting and different from what we are used to in this film.Although it''s not without it's flaws and there is a lot of them. Kerry Washington's character is plain annoying. She is under developed and under played. Which is a disappointment. Although the massive problem with this film is that it has a completely un-necessary 20 or 30 minutes towards the end of the film that dose not need to be there. It doesn't add anything and becomes kind of boring which is a shame. Also Quentin himself appears towards the latter end of the film for about five minutes of screen time. Of which he is truly awful.

In fact, some of them were pure Tarantino genius. Bottom line is, Django Unchained is a must watch movie, enjoyable to the very last second of it.",

The writing is superb as always, the directing is great, and the acting is just great. Jamie is great as Django, and Christopher is great as the bounty hunter Dr Shultz. But those who really steals the show for me, is Leonardo Di Caprio and Samuel L. Jackson. They are so great and creepy as villains, and brings this movie to a new level. great work, and maybe good enough for an academy award? Even though i really enjoyed this movie, i felt like it could have been even better, I expect some much of Tarantino, and i just feel like it could have been even better. It was a bit to long in my part, and the first half of the movie could have been cut down a bit, and also the last 20 minutes of the movie. But this is a great movie. 8 out of 10 for me. It would be interesting to see what Tarrantinos next project will be.",

Einstein was born in 1879!!!This clue of Taratino to us should have explained for some of previous reviewers that the movie was not gritty and messy, but a fantastic description the WAY TO GET TO FREEDOM AT ANY TIME. The rolls he has given to the slaves was to understand symbolic for any people or group living without freedom. Steve was the symbolic figure for those who were enjoying the benefits of - in this case slavery - and he was the very one who wanted to save the system even after the death of \"the big daddy\". I liked the scene after the funeral with the people, black and white, but in the shadows they were the same. One could not separate who was black and who white.The same way showed the flattering white under the clothes of the two black women their real face at the and of the movie, just before the explosion of the house.By the way explosion and dynamite: was it there in America about 1859 at all? Alfred Nobel has invented it perhaps a few years before, but in America? I'm not sure that it was there already. So the dynamite was for me a symbol again, besides many other things such as the \"white cake\" together with the papers for freedom in the hands of Di Caprio. Eating the \"white cake\" and shaking hands with DiCaprio Schultz would have joined in a way to Stephen, getting what he wanted - in this case to free Djangos wife -. But Schultz did not want to compromise, therefore had he chosen the death together with Candie, who was a symbol - in this case of the slavery and the South at the time around the Civil War.I'm sure the sunglasses for Django had some other purpose than to protect against the sun. I think it was because Django should not be blended on his way and he should not miss the final aim, in this case to free his wife.",

I don't walk out of many movies but left when Foxx was hanging upside-down and about to be de-balled. Saying this, I have sat through 'The Killer Inside Me', 'Killer Joe' and 'Drive'.

            "content": "Set in 1858, the last 2 years of the antebellum era, we see the Django played by Jamie Foxx marching in a slave chain gang when Dr. King Schultz, a bounty hunter liberates him in a most hilarious way. That is, by killing one of the slave traders and injuring another. When describing these actions, it shouldn't be funny by any standards yet, the genius and style of Quinton Tarantino makes it so. Quinton himself went on the other side of the camera to give us a brief but very explosive performance. I'm belly laughing at people getting shot, maimed, and blown up as if I was watching Looney Tunes. But there's plenty of drama and character development to enjoy as well. We see Django transforming from a timid slave into the confident bounty hunter sidekick to Dr. Schultz played by Christoph Waltz. And we see Dr. Schultz haunted by the atrocities of the antebellum era.I really enjoyed seeing Christoph Waltz playing the polar opposite of his SS character in QT's 2009 Inglorious Basterds, while maintaining his Austrian accent. Equally as delightful was Don Johnson who rejoined the QT team (see Machete 2010). Hopefully we'll see him as well as others to be regulars in Mr. Tarantino's movies. Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant as the Slave owner/Mandingo fighting promoter and with the introduction of his character, Calvin Candie; the brutality escalates exponentially and with historic accuracy. But still Quinton's movie style goes from a horrific brutal scene to a humorous moment at light speed. In fact at one point I unintentionally drew attention to myself as I laughed just a little longer and a little louder than the rest of the audience at the cartoon like demise of a slave mistress. I won't give \"another\" spoiler by describing the scene exactly, but I thought it was one the hilarious moments as only Quinton can do with this subject matter.Django is further evidence of genius arising from humble beginnings. Not bad for a boy who started as a video store clerk. I'm just glad I was one of the polite customers who always rewound.",

            "content": "I personally enjoy going to the movies when a new Tarantino movie comes out. And though I was a little skeptical about this one, I knew it would be a big one. What I ended up thinking by the end of this movie was \"my Christmas was made.\" \"Django Unchained\" is one of those movies where you have to appreciate the director's other work to appreciate this one. And if you're a true Tarantino fan, this movie will come close to your favorites. This movie offers all of the elements of a Tarantino movie at an extended level: There is an awesomely, extreme amount of violence which makes every one of them fun to watch; he gathers two of the best acting members of his entourage; and it's the classical revenge flick styles that he loves. The majority of the violence of this movie was done in the coolest ways ever. Some of them were a bit much, and some of them were done in a darkly funny way. I think it would probably be the second most violent Tarantino movie and the most violent Western I've ever seen. The actors were picked perfectly. Quentin brings back Christoph Waltz after he won an Oscar for his performance in \"Inglourious Basterds\". His performance is equally as good, if not better as he plays the role of Dr. King Schultz, a retired dentist- turned-bounty hunter who's determined to help Django rescue his wife. Tarantino's other golden actor, Samuel L. Jackson, gives off a solid role as Stephen, the very wise house slave that is skeptical of Django and Schultz. But the one performance that made the movie for me was perhaps my favorite actor, Leonardo DiCaprio, in his performance as the film's antagonist. His portrayal of Calvin Candie was the most swiftly crafted role of his career and he nailed it. And as a revenge flick, I thought this movie was written perfectly. This movie brings back the same feeling that Inglourious Basterds did. Considering the themes of \"Jews getting back at the Nazis\" and \"Blacks getting back at the slavers\", we can definitely see a third part to this major revenge series coming that Quentin has been making. The screenplay was written out so great that he made every minute of the movie, especially the dialogue which is traditional of a Tarantino movie, interestingly enjoyable. Everything about this movie was solid in my book. I give this movie its deserved 10/10.",

I hate the \"montage\" many scenes are cut in the middle of a conversation and not shot as one piece, it's very annoying and it makes it seems like the movie was botched. The actors were great but a ridiculous scenario won't change anything. Like why would the German kill Calvin Candie if he were so smart? He basically committed suicide just because he refused to shake his hand? He could have returned later and get his money or just forget about it. Why would he condemn his life and the life of Django and his wife too? That's just does not make any sense.",

But I knew from the opening credits that this movie would be controversial and confusing at the same time.

In all honesty it was entertaining at some points but to be quite blunt, it was insensitive and unnecessarily gory movie. Overall I would suggest to NOT see this movie.",

From his overuse of the racial term and people simply finding this film frustrating as he doesn't take this matter seriously as other films about slavery, people tend to not like this film. Despite all of this, I still enjoyed it and I do somewhat agree with the complaints that I have heard. He does use that particular word too much and it did become redundant after a while. I loved the majority of this film due to Tarantino's great talent behind the camera as he is able to have some pretty cool shots and bringing in the humor and shock factor very well.Adding his take on the western with a mixture of blacksploitation, the plot of this film was quite enjoyable. The first act introduces the main characters well, being performed greatly by the actors who made their friendship believable. The third act brought the over the top violence and entertainment factor very well. However, I really felt that, despite the second act having some great scenes, this is the weakest part of the film and it completely halted the movie for me. I loved the introduction of Calvin Candie, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and the interactions that he has with the main characters shows how great Tarantino's writing is. It is what happens after this scene that really has me feel the pace slow down. It felt like Tarantino wanted to focus more on the violence of slavery and overpushed the brutality of it with scenes that are very uncomfortable to watch and overstayed their welcome by stretching it out for longer than it should have been. It is when they are having dinner when the film picks back its pace and you will watch an incredible performance by DiCaprio in a scene that is very intense and well shot.Tarantino brings in great performances and there are two major standouts. Christolph Waltz once again was great as he portrayed Dr. King Schultz. His character is very likable and Waltz is so charismatic to where he is able to bring in a deep personality to the character. The other stand out is DiCaprio as he also brings his charm and that scene I mentioned earlier shows why his character is very menacing and downright scary. I was in awe watching him act in this scene and this scene alone is one of the reasons why I love DiCaprio as an actor. About Jamie Foxx, he was good and I did like his character, but I felt that he didn't wow me like the other two. He made the character cool and I enjoyed watching him shoot up some baddies. It's just that it felt more like a character he played in his previous action flicks. As much of a great actress she is, Kerry Washington was really wasted here. All she did in the film was to scream and react. There were too many reaction shots of her and she was under utilized to the point that it had me wondering if her character was actually important or not. Basically, this character could have been portrayed by anyone.I'm always debating which film of his is weaker and I tend to lean toward \"Jackie Brown\" and this film, just due to the fact that there were a lot of recognizable flaws that made me lose interest with the story, which had me wondering when the pacing would come back. But with Tarantino's talent and all of the positives I've mentioned earlier, this film is still worth watching, despite the huge negatives that I had.",

If he chooses to stay with him and be his partner, Schultz offers to assist him. They eventually learn that she was sold to a Mississippi plantation. Knowing they won't be able to simply walk in and say they want her, they devise a strategy in which the owner will welcome them into his home and they will be able to find a way.This film is really a story of vengeance and it's paced so very well, I found myself preparing to watch this film over the span of a couple days, but watching it in one sitting. The cinematography was absolutely amazing in this film, so visually appealing, and composition so interesting, furthermore the punch zooms were perfect to suit this film's tone, in its sporadic nature as well as more probably paying homage to old western cowboy films.The cast of this film was an all star hollywood cast, Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was a performance that created a false sense of comfort which made it even more terrifying when he would scream in rage. The main character, Django, played by Jamie Foxx, is splendid and gives the character a certain courage and valor. Django's personality diverges with Dr King Schultz, played marvelously by Christopher Waltz, I had already seen him in Inglorious Basterds, where he also had an amazing performance in, it was quite nice to see Christoph Waltz playing Dr King Schultz as it was almost as if this role was made for him.The action scenes were impactful and stunning with the slow motion shots fully highlighting that \"Tarantino style\".

DULL DULL DULL.The final 45 minutes could have been made into a youtube mini-series, netted 1/1000 of cash flow but at least been loyal to story telling.So here is the first 90 minutes of the movie Lt. Aldo Raine, (now played by Christopher Waltz,) frees \"Steamin\" Willie Beaman, (This time played by Jamie Fox,) takes away the shackles of a football and gives him a rifle.They go around killing white people, because we all know that from the beginning of time till Nelson Mandela was released only white people were wanted for crimes. ANNNNNNND, only enlightened white people could detect their deception. And wouldn't you know it, The enlightened white man again forces his concept of right and wrong on the liberated Black man...Played by Willie Beaman...played by Jamie Fox.They spend the better part of 2hours just killing white folk...that way the story of Brunhilde could be told....in a 2hour and 40 movie instead of another format that would net less money.Then they plot this elaborate scheme to rescue Willie Beaman's wife, Mia Wallace, played by Uma Thurman, played by Kerry Washington.This is accomplished by letting Egor, played by Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel L. Jackson, use his super spider sense and cat like intuition to detect the nefarious plot of buying a slave become known...then shoot DiCaprio in chest, sacrificing Lt. Aldo Raine, then after some fancy talking from Willie Beaman, you kill everyone, blow up the house and ride off into Super South, Super White, Super Racist Sunset...with your wife clapping you on like Mia Wallace after a line of coke.This movie was good, from about minute 130 till the end, the rest was a waste of time.I bought the movie and will be gifting it by throwing the dvd out my front door.",

I could not have been more wrong. Truth be told, there is no movie like this one. Django Unchained keeps you on your toes the whole time, having you wondering what will happen next. I do not think anyone could guess how this movie would play out, that kind of movie is rare.Besides the great plot, the acting was great. Jamie Foxx delivered a solid performance that no one would think he would be capable of. Leonardo Dicaprio went away from his usual type of character and he played such a twisted, evil plantation owner. No other actor could have played it better then him. He truly made you believe that he was that kind of guy. I was sad that he did not get an Oscar nominee, he definitely deserved it. To top off all of the superb performances, Chrstopher Waltz made the film go above a 10 out of 10. If only one supporting actor could have got chosen for an Oscar nominee, I believe that Christopher Waltz was the choice to make. He too went away from his usual evil conniving character, to the decent guy that everyone loves. He definitely had the best performance out of all of the characters in the Django and I would not be surprised if he walks away with the best supporting actor Oscar.All in all, if you are the type of person who does not mind a movie to get a little gory at times and loves a great movie, then Django Unchained is the one for you.",

            "content": "The newest movie created by Tarantino. In this most recent piece, Tarantino focuses on slavery, and uses many of the common culture induced stereotypes to produce (while not entirely accurately) a story surrounding the theme of black slavery.When I first turned on this movie, I had absolutely no idea what kind of movie I would be watching because I have never even heard of this movie, I stumbled unto its name at IMDb, and since I had a copy, I would throw it on without any idea what I was about to watch.It wasn't long before the surprise hit me that this was a Tarantino movie, and after watching Waltz's performance as Dr. Schultz, who as portrayed as just a common dentist, turns to surprise is very quickly by killing two slave owners and freeing the slaves that are bound to them with the attention of free Django. Not too long after this initial scene does he follow to surprise us more by insulting a nearby village by treating Django more like a welcomed citizen rather than his slave. Not after long, his behaviour gains attention from the law, and a conflict begins between Dr. Schultz and the town Sheriff, which results in the Sheriff being shot point blank.It is only after the deputy appears does Dr. Schultz's true identity and intentions are revealed. As it turns out, he is actually a bounty hunter, and the Sheriff was actually a wanted man.These surprising turn of events actually becomes the premise of the film. Waltz, who portrays Doc Schultz might not seem familiar to you at first, but he's more well known as Hans Landa from Inglorious Basterds. Being an unfamiliar face in modern cinema, he is clearly no stranger in modern Tarantino films.Jamie Foxx stars as the notorious Django, who now got a new leash on life (pun intended). As a bounty hunter, and partner of Schultz, he gets to take revenge on the white man on a journey to save his wife who was sold to a wealthy man named Candie (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio).After a clever plan to gain Candie's trust by pretending to be a black slave owner, Django and his bounty hunter partner/mentor are invited to Candie's home where the true antagonist of the film is revealed.A racist senior house slave named Stephen (portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson). When this character first appears on the screen, he surprises audiences in an uncomfortable unsettling but mildly humorous manner. Stephen, being such a loyal slave to his master has been so determined and pervasive that he doesn't even seem to realize that he himself is black, it is apparent through his notable racism against the blacks.His role as the antagonist greatly improve as the story unfolds, and eventually, a slave/slave confrontation slowly forms and leads to an explosive confrontation.Though mildly \"cult\" in nature, which most Tarantino movies tend to be, it certainly deserves recognition as a fun and clever film that any Tarantino fan and movie fan should certainly take consideration in watching.",

I don't see why he didn't at least get a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. But the Academy is what it is, major respect. Jamie Foxx i feel was lucky to get this role. I thought after his \"Ray\" Oscar that he would never get another chance but thank god for bounty hunters of early Amurica. Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz made the perfect duo. Leo being the antagonist in the film was a great twist. I think Quentin could've tried harder. Lets face it. This film could've been much better than it was and it was already great. Cinematography was not as good as it could've been, the story took some unexpected and unneeded plot twists. But it is good for what it is now. I would like to read the screenplay so Quentin.

But he did it!!!Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz steal the show. They say it's never a good idea to give the lead roles to two Academy Award winners, Django Unchained proves that theory wrong. Both actors are the ammo and this movie is a double barreled shotgun. It blows you away. The chemistry between Waltz and Foxx is great, they create the perfect, awkward duo. They know it and so does every other character in the movie. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Samuell L. Jackson plays the perfect 'bad guy'. If you thought his character was annoying and creepy in Lakeview Terrace, then you will love him in this movie. Leonardo Di Caprio has proved himself in a lot of artistic roles in the past, in this one he gets to be in touch with his psycho side. The dinner at his plantation in the movie is fine example of that. I read somewhere in an interview with Tarantino that the blood you see in that scene belongs to Di Caprio, but that he was so into his role that Tarantino kept filming. I applaud the result!! Kerry Washington plays a frightened but sweet wife to Django. Dr. King Schultz's response when husband and wife see each other again after a long period of separation is brilliant. The dialog: superb, the acting: superb, the cast: excellent. Overall: a big fat A+. Definitely one of my favorite movies of the last few years.",

            "review_title": "Beautifully complex and surprisingly deep",
            "content": "If there is a word apt enough to describe Django Unchained, it would be \"relentless.\" In his latest revenge epic, Quentin Tarantino transports the audience to the American South in the waning days of slavery, to deliver an uncompromising tale of revenge, love, and morality. He does so in his usual fashion, with tremendous brutality and language amid wonderfully dressed settings and characters. It has all the staples of the Quentin that his audience loves, and while the revenge theme is becoming a little tiresome, the film is punctuated with magnificent performances that place it among the year's best films.Django Unchained is not an easy film to watch; the path of brutality cut across every reel by the protagonists feels secondary to the reality of life for a slave circa 1858. Inglorious Basterds was very similar thematically: revenge of the oppressed Jews against the Nazis, but in that film, he avoided too overtly showcasing the brutality suffered by the Jews in World War II. Not so in Unchained, in which the titular Django (Jamie Foxx) is covered in scars he received as a slave, and the bloodiest parts of the film are not the revenge-spree, but those of innocent slaves brutalized by the cruelty of the world around them. Revenge, while still prevalent, takes a back seat to the deep-seeded wrong of inequality.Foxx stars along with Christoph Waltz as his bounty hunter/mentor Dr. King Schultz, who absolutely shines and captivates every moment he is on-screen. Waltz is the type of actor that is capable of infusing so much nuance into a role that his every movement and every emotion are almost shining on the screen. Already holding a Golden Globe for the performance, he is going to be a contender at the Oscars as well in an incredibly tough supporting actor category.As Django, Foxx is an angry, yet reserved, basket of complex emotions, though Foxx doesn't really seem to hit on the depth that the character requires. One can't help but wonder if Will Smith- whom Tarantino had wanted for the role- would have done Django that much more justice. Foxx has been largely ignored by major awards circuits, which is criminal given the character's journey in the film and the complexity of his situation. Instead the film is largely stolen from under him by Waltz and the ever-fantastic Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie. Leo may ham it up a bit in the role, but it is good to see him have some fun with the role after being ignored on the awards circuit for some absolutely brilliant turns. Still, Foxx does imbue the vengeful Django with a quiet strength that it is doubtful few actors could replicate; as much as he is meant to stick out in the story, Foxx plays him as subdued as possible, his end goal- finding his wife (Kerry Washington)- ever within his sights.For the Tarantino-phile, the film is replete with the director's trademarks: long scenes of dialogue with slowly mounting tension throughout, Mexican standoffs, incredible close-ups, a magnificent cameo by the man himself, and razor-sharp character development. His devotion to the re-creation and re-birthing of genres is nothing short of fantastic, fully transplanting the western into the American South. Quentin's script is as unrelenting as his vision, and has landed him a Golden Globe as well, making him a contender for the Best Original Screenplay statue at the Oscars.Particular mention must go to the score of the film and its period setting, both of which are absolutely fantastic. From its opening seconds, the film transports the audience to the pre-Civil War South, and uncomfortably or not forces them to stay there until the final seconds roll away. Tarantino's films always have a way of immersing their audience within the world in which they are occurring, and this is no exception.Little more can be said about Django Unchained that would do it any justice. While it'd be great to see Quentin move on to a theme that isn't revenge, Django showcases a thematic maturity and complexity that few of his prior films really engage in, and this is why his Golden Globe was so deserved, as would be an Oscar should he win. But for all of this, the greatest stroke of genius was casting Samuel L. Jackson as the Uncle Tom, and he is absolutely fantastic in the role. Hollywood also needs to start putting Walton Goggins (of The Shield fame) in more films, because even in this small role, he shines. Even if you need to turn away a time or two, don't miss this incredible film in theaters.Check out my profile for links to more reviews!",

            "content": "It's hard to find oneself a little torn about a movie from one of your favorite directors and came with high expectations. I'd like to say that I loved this new film, but I honestly didn't. Where should I begin?1) The LENGTH of the movie included unnecessary scenes that jeopardized the DEPTH & QUALITY of the story. Sure I appreciate the inclusion of classic Tarantino humour and unexpected scenes... but it's starting to get old... Unlike Basterds, every scene was mind blowing, tense, and tied together... but this one had way too much excess fat that just highlighted the director's need to \"meet his own criteria\" and be ha-ha-ha at the expense of the storyline.2) Nonsense strategy that involved Django & Dr. Schultz playing an elaborate unnecessary role to face Monsieur Candie... when am sure if the director had gone a different route, it would have been more intelligent. I can't put my finger on it, but the whole thing was quite.... bombastic. 3) I truly feel for Leonardo DiCaprio... this was supposed to be his year to FINALLY go home with an Oscar and with the hype that was attached to his acting in this movie... and THEN he shares 90% of his screen time with a perfect Samuel L Jackson who totally overshadows him. I was expecting him to stand out and leave a haunting impression just like Javier Bardem in No Country... but no... Leo was totally overshadowed by a brilliant Mr. Jackson. Don't get me wrong, Leo was good in this movie... but we've seen him in better roles... seriously.... Mr. DiCaprio don't ever take on another Tarantino movie ever again unless he gives you the LEADING role... you deserve it.4) The over dramatization of blood and gore is starting to be tiring and too expected.5) Tarantino cameos are becoming all to painful to sit through.The GOOD:1) Taking on a touchy, controversial topic, Tarantino is at his best with with some pretty funny moments! (ie. Big Daddy Mr. Don Johnson & Jonah Hill scene)2) The SOUNDTRACK3) Jamie Foxx & Samuel L. Jackson. Head on. Flawless acting.... and of course Mr. Cristoph Waltz is always a treat.Overall, it has that shock entertainment value and comedic substance that always comes with a Tarantino movie. All my friends who I watched with liked it, so am pretty much a minority. For it to compete with some of his best... I'm afraid it just doesn't live up to that.",

            "content": "Though the 2 and a half hour running time flies by at a click, this unwieldly film deals mainly in disappointment. By the perfunctory climax, one does not long for more Django adventures, or feel that the character has been born anew, but that the 'franchise' (forgive my use of that wretched term) has been decisively cremated.One senses this started out strong on the page, or certainly threatened strength, but got watered down and ultimately succumbed to Tarantino's inability to focus. The latter could be a strength, if he were to make a sprawling burlesque like Fellini's Amarcord, but he really needs the rigid conventions of genre cinema to act as structural elements for him to simultaneously push against and be reigned in by.Here we have a blaxploitation film in spaghetti western clothes. Mostly - Jamie Foxx dons some pimped out gear more appropriate to the 1970s than the 1870s at some points. I feel these scenes should have got a big laugh, but Foxx's uber-serious, broken-glass-clenched-in-the-buttocks performance undermines the laughs. Uncertainty of tone is so endemic in Tarantino's films that i think he employs it as a deliberate stylistic device. Here it's fatal. I wonder if Foxx had opposite ideas as to how Django should be played to his director, because he never seems comfortable in the role.It can't have helped that some of the films Tarantino drew upon for this film, the likes of Drum and Mandingo, are probably even more taboo today than they ever were. The invocation of the 'Django' name is a red herring, Franco Nero cameo notwithstanding. But as most readers probably know, in 'trash' cinema the 'Django' name transcended everything as a generic signifier - even being attached to the Nero Jaws knockoff The Last Shark Hunter.Such limitations as pandering to contemporary social mores deal a crippling blow to Tarantino, who excels at being as uninhibited as possible. Django should have been the personification of the exploited African-in-America's rage - the poster ought to have been Foxx bodily hurling DiCaprio's foppish villain, a la The Slams - why then is Christoph Waltz's King given most of the heavy lifting? An unconvincing sensei for the perturbed Django, who doesn't get much of a hero's journey, Instead, he is unfortunately mere physicality - stripped and strung up, or strutting in his finery - surely the kind of one dimensional black character we want to avoid.Django gets to blow away a bunch of people at the end, in a way that seems simply brutal and inhuman. Compare this with the climax of Corbucci's Django, who endures suffering, loses everything, even the fingers that gifted him with sharpshooting skills, but manages to revenge himself on his tormentors. He survives, but is disfigured by his experiences - the kind of operatic pathos that is sorely missing here. Tarantino was concerned with honour in Reservoir Dogs, but he subsequently seems to invest his pictures with all the morality of a drunken parking lot brawl, with no blow too low.With it's compromised and unwilling hero figure the picture is fatally uncentred, and it's ambitions as commentary on a genre curtailed, Tarantino compensates by trying to reach the fifteen year old boy audience through the violent excesses his critics rung their hands about.There are several other stenchers. A ghastly sermon against racism hinges on the argument that Alexander Dumas wasn't white. I know social media has made it so we have to all talk on the level of the least intelligent people in the room but this clunker should've been cut at the script stage. Tarantino appears in a dire cameo as a vile slaver - who for some reason is 'Australian' (I think).It's ultimately a rather middling, inconsequential Western adventure. Enjoyable enough, but the unwillingness to commit and really get to grips with in a fearless way the disfiguring, dehumanising abhorrence of slavery and racism, which a younger Tarantino would have done, makes you wonder, why bother at all.The only one who really does go for it and deserved an Oscar, is Sam Jackson - he is brave and brilliant enough to make his character a truly complex man, adjusted to a situation almost beyond the imagining of todays audiences, rather than the contemptible and pathetic straw man it would have been easy to make him.",

It sets the stage for the rest of the film. But then it kind of goes off track after the Saloon scene, but this doesn't deter from the quality of the film, it just feels a little less like a Tarantino movie.Waltz and Di Caprio are just superb in their roles. Foxx holds his own, but you can tell his role was meant to be for someone else.The final 3/4 of this film really is quite clich\u00e9d and muddled. A little predictable, and slightly lazy. Yes the script is razor sharp, acted superbly, and I haven't heard a better script all year, but it still felt a little laboured and that a few scenes were picked out of a hat and just thrown in. The bag head scene is hilarious, but it looked like they plucked it from Blazing Saddles and threw it in. I can't fault it because it made me laugh, but in all honesty it didn't need to be in the movie.There are moments where QT shows his magic, like the dinner scene with Candie, Schultz and Django ... That is classic Tarantino, and I loved that scene. The saloon scene in the beginning is also brilliantly put together and Waltz outdoes himself and deserves his Oscar for that alone. But the rest of the film just plods along with no real direction.Sam Jackson's character is also quite a laughable one, virtually mocking himself. He knows the character is a joke, so he does his best to play it out that way.But overall, the film is just popcorn fun. Top quality script, acting, sets and the final shootout is QT at his glorious and hilariously over the top best.

Going by the Oscar wins and availability, decided to watch it to my complete disappointment and disgust. What bad lies and nil-to-non-existent acting. When it became clear there was going to be no improvement in the story or the pace, I stopped watching. So saving you the trouble before you get as far. And I believe that I have to write 10 lines on a minimum to make you believe it is true. I am a history buff. I love historical fictions and fictional histories. This movie falls in a category all in itself. Other than some glossy historical costumes, it might have been set in Washington D.C. Since then I've read things that say there may be a political agenda in this. Nope- the independent cinema viewer in me couldn't watch it long enough to agree. Unentertaining and tiresome!",

Quentin always brings the best out of his actors, and maybe that's because he just writes such great characters for them. The theme for the film is vengeance, which is the usual for Tarantino. He follows the Tarantino style as you can expect, but he doesn't fail to throw in a few surprises. The dialogue is fantastic, the pacing is terrific, the action is spectacular, and overall it's a very entertaining movie. Set in the Deep South and Old West, a freed slave (Jamie Foxx) embarks on a trail across America with a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) to rescue his wife from a charismatic and cruel plantation owner (Leo DiCaprio.) The sequences are sensational from the very beginning but the key component in making this film so great is the two intriguing characters at the heart of it, Foxx and Waltz.",

The confrontation between Django and Calvin doesnt even occur. Its like QT didnt even bother to pay off the setup and lazily decided to fill up the third act with gun splatter gore. QT just lacks the patience or restraint to create a continous coherent narrative. He hasnt graduated from a series of skits stiched together by a thin plot populated by paper mache characters.

Leonardo DiCaprio is a white slave owner who thinks that black people are stupid because they don't gang up and beat their owners. Jamie Foxx shoots a lot of people and the shooting effects are very violent and the camera is very still which allows me too see the violence and soak in the violence which is pleasurable to my eyes. When people talk it makes me excited because the chances are very likely that Django or the white guy are going to slit someone's throat. In my memory of the film Django himself never actually talked. The white guy talked sometimes and Leonard DiCaprio talked the most. There was also a woman, and an old black man who looked a lot like Denzel Washington in prosthetics or maybe Morgan Freeman who makes everything go wrong. Overall I'd give this movie a 7 because I liked the violence a lot but I hated how long the movie was and most of the scenes.",

The movie was a masterpiece presentation of an update to the classic ultra-violent western movie, exceeding its goal as an action film and a thought provoking view of slavery. Although nowhere as intense as 12 Years a Slave, Django Unchained accomplishes everything it wanted to through the story of a bounty hunter named Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) and his fellow freeman Django (Jamie Foxx). The gunslinging pair sets out to find Django's wife (Kerry Washington) and becomes acquainted with psychotic and deranged slave owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is the owner of the massive plantation Candyland. Do not doubt that this movie is not original due to its western theme, it is an entirely new look at the awful era of slavery. The movie's characters are portrayed in some of the greatest acting I have ever seen, displaying the movie's plot with not a single loose end. Django Unchained was an extremely gory and violent thrill ride that never ceased to amaze me all the way through to its explosive final moments.",

            "content": "A movie by Quentin Tarantino is the polar opposite of a box of chocolates: for the most part, you know exactly what you're going to get. Fantastically written dialogues, larger-than-life characters, more obscure movie references than you can shake a stick at and intense violence that borders on the grotesque. These are some of the elements that characterise Tarantino's work. In this sense, Django Unchained is classic and true Tarantino, his style is unmistakably present. Largely for the better, but unfortunately, also for worse.We meet the black slave Django (Jamie Foxx) who is set free by an enigmatic bounty hunter, named King Schultz. Schultz needs Django's help in order to bring a band of outlaws to justice and in return he pledges to help Django exact revenge on the slave traders who are responsible for Django's current state of being and free Django's wife, who they have imprisoned. The two form an odd couple, especially at the time of 1850's America, where African Americans dangle at the bottom of the social ladder and are mostly seen as inferior beings. The main storyline of Django Unchained is a classic tale of revenge, moulded to fit the Western times in which it takes place.The acting is what stands out in this movie. Especially Christoph Waltz, who absolutely shines in the form of Dr. Schultz. His character is a proficient shooter, but preferably uses his wide vocabulary and unique use of wordplay to overcome (and baffle) his opponents in favor of shooting bullets. The stunning performance by Waltz is only matched (but rarely outdone) by Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays slave trader Calvin Candy, who is equally menacing as he is flamboyant. When these two are on screen, magic happens. Unfortunately for Foxx, that is also where it is apparent that he can't hold a candle to the aforementioned actors. He feels extremely uncomfortable in the role of Django, especially in the first half of the film.I never found Foxx as Django to be entirely convincing and honestly, I couldn't care less about his motives to free his wife and get his revenge. His character was that bland to me. A far cry from the roaring rampage of revenge that is The Bride from the two Kill Bill movies. I also wasn't that impressed by Samuel L. Jackson as Candy's butler and right hand. It was refreshing to see him try out something new, but to me it felt like it was a Western-styled caricature of a foul- mouthed black man that Jackson has played once too many times in his career.The first act of the movie is sheer, utter brilliance. Especially the scene in which Django and Schultz meet is an early highlight for me, followed later by an even better scene in which the velvet tongue of Schultz manages to escape certain death from a firing squad by an angry mob turns the tables in the process. This ride of cinematic splendor continues until Django manages to kill the slave traders they were after in the first place. After that, It felt to me that the movie loses every sense of direction. The next hour and a half is a collage of scenes that lack any form of cohesion and seem haphazardly strung together, just for the sake of including them in the movie.That is not to say that the scenes near the end are all bad. In fact, often the opposite is true. I fondly remember a scene in which a band of thugs discuss their garments, or better said, the lack of functionality thereof. This scene had me laughing all the way through. It is a well-known fact that Tarantino mainly makes movies for himself and he doesn't care what other people think about them. For the sake of the viewers of his work, it is clear that he is in dire need of an editor that knows when to reel him in and decides which scenes are essential to the plot. Django Unchained is about 45 minutes too long. The film should have ended with a shoot-out that seemingly is a fitting finale, but after that, the movie just drags on for the sake of doing so, it seems.Django Unchained is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, I enjoyed my time watching this. I also think it is not the classic in making that many point it out to be. I doubt Tarantino takes advice from anyone, but if in some parallel universe I could give him a hint, I would tell him to re-evaluate his manner of filmmaking, before he becomes a parody of his own success.",

The plot was interesting because at the end you think that the bounty hunters are plotting against the main villain but in fact the main villain was not only plotting against the bounty hunters, but trying to find the smallest mistake they could do to make all of their effort, journey and struggle completely useless. Its complex, im not good with the names of the characters but Django seems to be the hero and his mentor, a germanic European native. The fact is when you watch the movie, each scene keeps the viewer tied into the plot. The comic style of quentin films are still in there. It was okay. A good movie if you like his filmography, which turned from suspense thrillers to non-sequential art with a action packed cowboys shoot em up style of directing. Maybe he concentrated more on the artsy aspects of film which let him lose the edge for another A grade movie. He got more simle and comic orientated in his films but stayed the same. He also let lose the ego in most of his characters, which in actuality made his films good. NOt as good as say pulp fiction, but a rehash of the inglorius bastards style.",

After the success of Inglorious Bastards, Django Unchained has a lot to live up too-and it pulls it off. In fact, it may be even better than Inglorious Bastards- but I'll let you be the judge of that. Jamie Foxx plays Django, a slave sold to two brothers who is inevitably \"saved\" by Dr. King Schultz (Waltz) by offering him a job as a bounty hunter. Schultz is also a bounty hunter, and is after a family of three brothers, and knows that Django has seen them before and knows who they are, therefore the best person to help him out. In exchange for those lives, Schultz promises to find where Django's wife was sold and rescue her. They discover his wife Broomhilda (Washington) was sold to a plantation owned by the famous Calvin Candle (DiCaprio). There, they buy their way into his life in order to be able to buy the freedom of Broomhilda...and then, like every Tarantino movie...things go horribly wrong. Does Django free his wife? Does Schultz survive? Is there a huge epic blood bath at the end? If you've seen Tarantino's movies...you could probably say yes to two out of three of those things. Django Unchained was a fabulous edition to Tarantino's list of unforgettable films. All though there is a lot of controversy surrounding it, because the N word is said over 110 times, keep in mind that Tarantino obviously did not mean for this to be a historical representation of the 1800s. Sure, it's got slavery and western aspects of the 1800s, but he did not intend for it to be historically accurate, nor did he want to be an exact representation of the slave trade. It's Tarantino. You can pretty much assume that everything will be exaggerated, and that there will be blood...and it will be awesome. Also, Christoph Waltz should definitely win for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.",

As Django and Shultz team up the movie unfolds with much violence and use of the \"N\" word. It reaches a point where Dr Shultz is killed and that is where the movie ends in my mind. Shultz was by far the most interesting character in the movie and after his death, I did not care anymore. Leonardo DiCaprio overplayed his role as he can easily do as a villainous slave and plantation owner. Actors Samuel Jackson and Don Johnson both were excellent in their respective roles but Christoph Waltz was the standout in this film and as mentioned, after his death, there is no movie anymore.",

Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz is incredible its role. I didn't know that you could achieve a character with so much bipolarity and so much sympathy, was achieved. From the first moment that appeared i liked the character, what found very cartoons. These love to me. Leonardo Di Caprio as Calvin Candie is the cursed God. His character is a big that is only interested in the money. Peliando blacks when they were on their own, instead of stopping them cheered the damn.Samuel L.

It was interesting to me to see the use of salesmanship and negotiation when getting out of tough situations.

Some of the language in the movie is uncomfortable to hear, but I suppose it was valid for the setting of the movie 1850's before the civil war began.

Black man comes to plantation riding horse , dressing how he wants , speaking openly and shoots white plantation overseer and then whips another. Reactions from black folk who work at plantation are just priceless and you can see that justice has been done in their eyes. Ruthless overseers get what they deserve from hands of black man.

After all, this is slavery and Tarantino seems apologetic: no false tears, but amazing and despicable human conduct. Forget the false debate, it's not about truth, not about reality but about condition and every situations, taken as a all, are part of History. But it could not be called a Tarantino session, if the last part of the movie was not his usual \"we accelerate it all and it will blow to your face\" scenes! Amazing how all his characters seem to culminate and reveal their true potential at the same breaking point.And there is a lot to say about them: our fellow \"devils\", Django and his love one, are not only unbreakable but really growing in presence scenes after scenes.Both more human than the White folks, and savagely fierce. The beloved Doctor could be some kind of Doc Holliday, well educated, dentist, nice appearance and... hell of a killer when his fellows \"Monsieur\" Candy or \"Big daddy\" are archetypes of their generation. Even the supporting roles are great: you have seen some in Westernish production (like the Moonlight guy from Justified) and you will recognize Tarantino's favorite, Samuel L Jackson ahead, but first go back to see some Kill Bill, Death Proof. There is more than just a touch of the same style in all his movie, with some close-up shots you will enjoy the winks! Despite the Candy land and the Suggar daddy, life in those areas is nothing sweet and tasty. You have a taste of blood lingering in your body and the editing (amazing) is here to help you remember. When you think that there has to be a bottom to strongly violent inhuman behavior, you will fall in a the rabbit hole... OK, you can feel bored at some point, asking yourself \"is that it?\" but this kind of cinema has always more to show, more to convince you and feel appreciated. Yes the story has some hole in it, but think of Django unchained as a puzzle with pieces that you can contemplate separately but that, all in, do the trick! The final touch, which makes this movie even better than the last, is absolutely the score: rich, different, well adapt, strong and natural... This score is everything at the same time! This movie is cultural, it has an atmosphere, a scent of wonder, it's the Tarantino.",

And the gore was the best I've seen in a while. The acting was good for the most part. Some parts that I think we're meant to look cheesy had bad acting so that's not affecting the score even though it would still be a 9. I was intrigued by the very interesting characters.

This is the only Tarantino film I have ever seen that made me crack a tear.The soundtrack was superb, from the slow \"cow walking\" western ditties to the modern \"rap\", clearly out of place, yet, somehow functional. Brilliant editing.J. Foxx was great, as usual. C. Waltz takes you places you want movies to take you. He is the only actor I know that can get one to like a Nazi, (Inglorious Basterds.), and he carries his charm in everything he does. S. Jackson should have been nominated for his contribution. Best Sam Jackson EVER! The mob arguing over the sack eye holes will make movie history.Django is fantastic feature, despite the long runtime, (2:45).

The film follows the freed slave Django and his pursuit with Dr. King Schultz to save his wife Broomhilda from bondage. The characters in the film are presented so well, their motivations and back story fleshed out nicely. You never have to guess who the bad guys are from the good. The action is fast, and bloody. The language is coarse, and funny at times. The soundtrack has a nice blend of western sounds and modern songs. The movie is an homage to spaghetti westerns from the past, and is overall very enjoyable. The camera cuts are nice and remind me of Kill Bill, Tarantino's earlier work. The camera at times zooms in on the character's faces as they are about to enter a showdown, or a pivotal moment. The movie does an excellent job at telling its story, and making you feel for Django. It has an excellent sense of intensity and triumph that is unmatched in many films today. After seeing this film, I was truly mesmerized, and had to watch it again. Overall, I give Django Unchained (2012) by Quentin Tarantino a 10 out of 10. Definitely one of Tarantino's best.",

            "content": "Django Unchained is the story of a slave (Jamie Foxx) rescued by a German bounty hunter called Dr. Schultz (played brilliantly by Cristoph Waltz) to help identify three money earning targets. Django becomes the bounty hunter's partner and fulfils his search for his long-lost wife. They find her working in the house at a plantation run by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) where Samuel Jackson hams it up as an old butler character. Chaos ensues \u2013 you would be disappointed if it didn't. It is almost as if by the end of the film Tarantino can't hold himself back any longer and shouts for bloody mayhem.The tricky subject matter and the proliferation of the dreaded 'N' word go some way in explaining the controversy surrounding the film. However I would suggest that most of the controversy was probably drummed up by the studio to get bums on seats. Only the most backward of white Americans would see anything to complain about in this film. For me it seemed less violent than Kill Bill or Inglorious Basterds and the only thing that perhaps would unnerve a few racist rednecks was the fact that it was a black man killing white folk (and getting paid for it).Django is a natural quick draw and sharp-shooter and uses his new-found skills to great effect during the story. As a Western this is part of the cannon and not to be questioned. Equally it is a given that Django can not only ride a horse but do so very well. What sets the film apart from most Westerns is the brilliant dialogue and the humour. Dr Schultz in particular gets some great lines and slowly reveals himself of somewhat of a humanist despite his killing ways. He is the light to Calvin Candie's dark racism and the final scenes between the two are some of the best Tarantino has filmed. There is a similar thread to the anti-Nazi history rewrite finale of Basterds, but in this case the outcome is loaded with more tension and heart.Foxx's character very quickly becomes the strutting black hero that we would expect from Django if we reference back to the glut of similarly titled films in the 60's. In some ways his character is less three-dimensional than Dr Schultz and indeed Candie, and this is perhaps a drawback of Tarantino 'reloading' an old film concept in much the same way as he did with Basterds. I love Westerns and I love Tarantino and so for me it is a brilliant combination, but I would like him to try something wholly from his own imagination next time around.3 additional factoids I gleaned after my second viewing - I was curious over the man at the bar just after we see the bloody mandingo fight and are introduced to Candie. The mysterious man has just seen his fighter bested and killed with a hammer, but still has the time for a a tequiela at the bar and a quick word with Django posing as a black slaver / mandingo expert. The man says he knows that Django is spelt with a 'D'. It is a bit of an incongruous comment and made me wonder 'who was that guy?' Well, that guy was a cameo by the original actor in the 1966 version of Django - so of course he would know how it was spelt. It was another nod to the previous 'Westerns' gone before by Tarantino; just not as subtle as the pulllling-the-man-and-horse-down scene or even subtler other references.Secondly was the female tracker. We see her briefly in two scenes. One where she is holding a hatchet and her face is mostly covered by a bandana just before D'Artagnian is ripped apart by dogs, and one where she is looking at a 3D photo in the trackers lodge just before she is gunned down in revenge for D'Artagnian's death. 'Who's that girl?' I thought twice over. The subject of a deleted scene mayhaps? Well, as there were no deleted scenes on my Blu-ray I don't know, but I was watching the credits and saw the name Zoe Bell. Which rang a bell (scuse pun). IMDb to the rescue! She was Uma Thurman's stunt double in Kill Bill and she has worked on an amazing number of films (including Deathproof). Tarantino slipped her in as a favour it would seem and there is rumour that she failed the audition for Candie's sister, so he probably felt obliged to include her somewhere in the film.Third. The blood on Candie's hand. I thought it was a brilliant piece of writing and helped emphasize the darkness of the character when he smears it over Broomhilda's face. I also liked the way the blood develops naturally, it is not overtly referenced by the camera and Candie continues his tirade without seeing to the cut. It turns out that this was real blood and a real cut and DiCaprio (true artiste that he is) carried on going even though he had genuinely accidentally cut himself. Bravo",

I believe Waltz might be one of the best currently active actors out there right now and whether or not you dislike or like Quentin Tarantino films, I would urge anyone to watch this film solely to see what great acting is. Furthermore, the story is captivating and the way this film handles slavery and American history at this point in time is handled in a way that I have yet to see in another film.

It is a visceral , outrageous , frightening , in some points hysterical movie that examines this country's history with racism and slavery that we still haven't worked through , and still bear the scars of. Who's to say that there wasn't a German bounty hunter roaming the old south in the days before the Civil War , and who's to say that he didn't employ a former slave as his assistant? OK , that probably didn't happen , but Quentin Tarrentino is an artist , and a very skilled one at that , so he takes some liberties , which pay off big in the end. The movie gives us scenes of the old south and slavery that we haven't seen before , frightening , ugly scenes , that may well have been the common , everyday experience for a lot of people , and puts it in the context of \"this is how it was , and this was the reality \" . He does it the style of the spaghetti western , and throws in some comic relief to take some of the pain away , which makes it a little easier to take , but it is still a highly disturbing vision , and can weigh on your mind long after the film is over, which is what good art is supposed to do. I saw this film at the theater when it first came out , and was troubled by it's brutality being shown as everyday life , but , I'm watching it on HBO now, of course the small screen will tone down some of the brutality , and the other aspects will come through, as the comic relief aspects , showing what a bunch of buffoons the \"poor white trash\" element could be, there is a \"Blazing Saddles\" sort of silliness to some of those scenes. To put it into perspective , \"Django Unchained \" , is an important film , trying to grasp an important topic , in a way we haven't seen in quite this way before. It's hard to watch in places , it is disturbing , but it makes you think , and that's always a good thing.",

Several felt he wasn't taking the topic serious enough. Were they right? Yeah to an extent. Tarantino's favorite genre is the western/blaxploitation one and he continuously makes those kinds of movies. He loves revenge fantasies. So, he made this in those veins.\nBasically, it is about a slave Django (Jamie Fox) who is freed from a previous owner by Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) who is a bounty hunter and he requires Django to find a couple of men who have a bounty on their head. Then they become friends and Schultz finds out that Django's wife is kept as a slave by Calvin Candie (Di Caprio) and they try to free her. It is a basic revenge story which has the usual Tarantino dialogue and violence. It is really bloody and there were moments where I couldn't watch it. The violence isn't the gritty serious type, but rather the fun one (Because it is fun, Janet!!!!).\nI really enjoyed watching it. There were some really impressive set pieces and moments. The dialogue was sharp and quite funny. There were some quirky subtexts as well. The best part were the performances. Jamie Fox is great as he has the right mix of nastiness and naivety in him. Christoph Waltz plays a good guy version of Hans Landa and he is quite charming. He really has a wonderful screen presence. Di Caprio is great as well as the charming yet nasty and downright evil slave owner. But the pick of them was Sam Jackson who plays a pretty complex character as the head slave of Calvin Candie. Other than these there isn't much to like. It is, like most Tarantino movies, all style and no substance. It lacks the thematic depth of other great movies. He is a wonderfully talented guy. He uses dialogue wonderfully. Camera movements, blocking and staging are pretty great in his later movies. He obviously has everything it takes to make a thematically deep but fun movie but chooses not to. He has a trope and he has stuck on to it since the beginning and frankly it is wearing thin. Every one of his post Kill Bill movies glorifies violence. The sole intentions of him is to make cool movies and it is fine but it really frustrates me because he is better than this.\nBut there is one pretty complex thing he made. That is the relation between Stephen (S Jackson) and Calvin Candie. It is established that Stephen was in the house before Candie was born and he had raised him. The relation is portrayed as a usual slave owner one in font of others but behind, Stephen is shown to have dominance over Candie. It was a rather interesting concept but didn't really take off.\nOverall, a descent fun movie with awesome performances and dialogue and some nice camera work and shots but nothing more.

They were separated from their families and sold to slave traders who moved them to different states. The slaves had to go walking, many times in freezing temperatures. They could not do anything to change their horrific situation. I am sure they wished to take revenge on their oppressors, but it was impossible. However, this is possible today through the art of cinematography and thanks to the genius of Tarantino. If we observe the film's main poster, we see the word \"vengeance\" we see blood splashing everywhere and we see the film's title \"Django Unchained.\" The movie is about a black individual who is unchained from slavery and looks for a super bloody revenge. Tarantino does this through a thrilling plot full of twists. The way Tarantino deals with the arrogance and sense of supremacy of the plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio) is simply magnificent. Likewise he shows nice examples of friendship, dignity and love. When you leave the movie theater you have the feeling that you had a great time.",

I fully understand that some people not unreasonably dislike the movie because of the extraordinary amount of violence, use of the N word, and depiction of slavery in a way that they find demeaning. I respect these views, but reach a different conclusion.I think that Tarantino's work is genius. Amidst all of the violence (of which there is a lot) there is real subtlety in his recounting of some of the worst aspects of American history. Slavery was an awful period in American history, and its effects have lingered too long. The slave culture was filled with inhuman behavior and very complicated human interactions (white/black, black/black, male/female, and white/white). The movie caused me to reflect a lot on these things, both with sadness and understanding. When I say \"understanding,\" I do not mean acceptance; I mean comprehension.Tarantino uses notions of redemption and retribution, some humor, and some embracing relationships -- none of it realistic -- to cushion the blows of history that his story exposes. Tarantino's devices caused me to feel no less disgust over slavery, nor did they cause me to feel that history had been corrupted or demeaned. He used exaggerated forms of art to drive home things that we should never forget going forward. It is a hard way to learn lessons, but Tarantino pulled it off majestically (in my view). And the four lead actors - Waltz, Foxx, Jackson, and DiCaprio -- were truly brilliant.",

I am a fan of QT and can pin point my favourite film as being Pulp Fiction, another convoluted story which comes together in the end. Sadly Django never came close and left me comparing it to Death Proof (not his best work either). Firstly this film was sooooo long it made my bottom ache. There seemed a lot of pointless scenes that really were unnecessary to push the story line forward. Also, Christphe Waltz was absolutely awesome in Inglorious Basterds but seem to reprise the role in Django ( in a round about way). It wasn't all bad. There were points in the film that I enjoyed but they were few and far between. Perhaps I was missing something and it may be that it requires a second viewing but my initial thoughts were disappointing and could have been a lot shorter to get to the final pay off. One final thought is this; if the need for pointless scenes were needed then perhaps it would have been better to include the back story of the Zoe Bell character.....Give peas a chance!",

Was it a little long? It was, but I think it was well done. Sure it could have ended in the bloodbath, but this was one time where I found the sort of \"extended ending\" to be a good one. Hell, a great one. And I've got to disagree that it was sloppy. It was already nearly 3 hours, there was a simple story but a lot of ground to cover. And I've got to say while on that subject I disagree with other reviewers that said Jamie Foxx was uncomfortable. I think he was very comfortable. The story may be a simple one but a crucial part is the development of the characters, particularly Django. He is SUPPOSED to look uncomfortable. He's masquerading as a slaver, the thing he hates most, while holding back every raw emotion in his being until the end when he finally lets it all go. I don't think anyone could have played this role better. 'Nuff said for Jamie Foxx. The man is brilliant and if Ray didn't convince you then Django should. Lets not forget this is a Tarantino film, too. Over the top is his style, but he does it like no other. The comedy element is there underneath the brutality and the raw humanity flows throughout, and runs the gamut. Every emotion is showcased to its fullest. If you don't like Tarantino films you won't like this. If this is your first Tarantino film you should watch a few more. There is a distinctive style here.",

            "content": "Last week during violent attacks of fever due to flu I had a few \"clarifying\" thoughts. The first was about the last three films of Tarantino. I got the idea that the films are personal dreams, fantasies of the main characters, who are at the time of the dream, fantasy in a coma, shortly before their own death. Beatrix Kiddo dreaming or fantasizing to kill Bill and his gang during her coma. In Inglorious Basterds are all Jewish girls in the early scenes murdered and one fantasizes that she escapes and takes revenge on all Nazis and Django dies for example, during the shootout in the cupboard, but fantasizes to take revenge on all his opponents. This theory is mainly fed by some unrealistic plot twists that are more like a dream, fantasie and wherein Tarantino doesn't do any effort making the twist plausible and even chooses clearly unrealistic special effects, such as the self excavating Kiddo in Kill Bill II , the final massacre at the cinema in Inglorious Basterds and the last half hour of Django, with all sorts of cartoonish effects and happy ending. Tarantino shows what cinema is a reality in itself, where (historical) victims still can take revenge, like in a dream or fantasy. If this theory is correct and consciously applied by Tarantino then there must be concrete evidence, clues in the movies. A reason to watch them all over again.",

There are so many strange elements, character non sequiturs and inappropriate dialogs that take away from what is a good story and fine set of actors.Here is the short list of issues I have. The music would have been perfect for \"Blazing Saddles\". The hokey lettering for times and places (especially the elongated \"Mississippi\"). Some of the scenes purported to be in the deep South obviously came from dry rocky areas of California. The overuse of the sudden zoom shot (like the early scene with DiCaprio). The stupid hooded mask scene before they raid Dr. Schultz' wagon. What it does to the film is to make it look disjointed and out of context a good portion of the time. Plus, plot contrivances appear to make the story end properly. I can't buy the whole Django escape from the crew taking him to the mine.This film is long, and by that I mean long in a way that is not good. I kept wondering when it was going to end. The movie is by no means a good follow up to \"Inglorious Basterds\" which was a fine film. The gratuitous violence and gore isn't what hurts the film as much as how the tone is mangled at various points along the way. If you like films, you'll probably want to see it.

Django Unchained stars Jamie Fox as the lead role who sets out with the bounty hunter played by Christopher Waltz to buy his wife back from a slave owner. Before that takes place Waltz and Foxx team up as bounty hunters by killing a few people and getting paid while doing. Waltz makes a deal with Foxx that if he helps him with the bounties he will assist with the purchase of his wife. The film itself actually has parts that will make you laugh. It is a pretty violent film and for some the gore may be a little over the top. A bit of a warning..if you are offended by the N-word you might want to avoid this movie. It is used a bunch but one must realize the era for which it was filmed in. I am a black male and I wasn't offended one bit and even laughed a few times because most of the characters used it. From Jamie Foxx to Leonardo DiCaprio. Samuel Jackson has a pretty memorable role in the film and is sure to get a few laughs out of you. Brilliant acting from everyone involved. Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar for his supporting role. I believe he has already won the Golden Globe for His part. The film is 15 minutes shy of 3 hours but never bores one bit. Some of the music may throw some people off because how modern the music is but it fits the scenes it was being used for. As with all his films Taratino makes a guest appearance in the movie towards the end. Watch it and enjoy this film",

The intrigue is masterly sustained through almost the whole movie; from the scene introducing passerby Dr Schultz, appreciating how situations are surprisingly unfolded is highly enjoyable. The characters though touching stereotypes and remaining on their surface have a singular originality that makes you want to know them and the rhythm of the action never demounts. Then there is also the criticized mono-thematic hang up of Tarantino: Revenge? yes, but not any type; its always the weak undermined character that overpasses the worst difficulties, becomes unbelievably strong and demolishes what seemed to be undefeatable; There is a source o pleasure in watching our own feeling of insignificance and impotence being overcome and that is a key part of his successful formula.",

I know his step-dad played guitar and piano. But it doesn't say he plays anywhere. But not only does he have writer credits in many of the songs to the Django soundtrack but I'm noticing that the whole soundtrack is very very guitar driven. Lots of Dm, Gm and Am pieces. :)",

Second, look at the time the movie is set on, it was like that and everything in the film was near carry to build and get your head in that time, in that world.

Another thing I have read here about is about the \"unnecesaryness\" of many things, being there most of the violence and small talk in the film involving information not relate to the movie at all but it is absolutely devoted to building the characters. Well there's nothing to say there, I think every scene in this movie was needed, completed it. My last words: just enjoy the movie for what it is and what it was made for, never forgetting of course the use of a logical procedure for the making. Not many films get to be good without making sense (example: Un Chien Andalou) but most of them you'll need reason for accepting and considering it of value.

Reminded me so much of a Clint Eastwood spaghetti western except this movie has an exceptional plot, great acting, humor, action, and all around fun. I think it really tried to show how horrible slavery really was in the years before the Civil War. I can't stress enough of what a great job that the cast did, especially Jamie Foxx, Waltz, DiCaprio, and Jackson!!! This is a MUST SEE!!! I was hesitant to go at first not sure if it would be a flop, but my sister and her husband went, they said you have to see this movie. I am glad I did.Thank you, Tarantino for a great movie!!",

            "content": "After Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, which packed an irresistible powerful punch three years ago, he establishes a great imprint of what his customers were looking for on a video store when he was working for one. Yes, it's the Spaghetti Western flicks, and now it's a bloody wish fulfillment. Django Unchained is one of Tarantino's greatest passions in Western flicks. Whether you're just starting to get to know QT, Django perhaps is a great way to start. Much has been said about Tarantino's portrayal of gore, mayhem and relentless moments, he transform it in forms of merriment. Like any films in the director's filmography, it's full of hilarious moments which came from his own correspondence. And most of all, the film is peppered with his own music collection: From Johnny Cash to John Legend, and wait, from rapper RZA? That's just funny, but tolerable.Tarantino's script is also patient and edifying. It's in no hurry to show what QT fans are waiting for. Obviously, every Tarantino films are comprised with slow-burn dialogues because it's funny how smart and mad he is about the movies. It serves as a retaliation of what he likes and what he doesn't like and I don't blame him for it. We can never be defiant in Tarantino's universe, we owe a lot to him, and he's just doing the favor.The film starts in 1858 in Texas, two years before the Civil War. Django (Jamie Foxx) and a number of chained slaves have been a victim of slavery and was bought by the Speck Brothers (James Remar and James Russo). Meanwhile, a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) confronts the brothers and frees Django. The reason that Schultz chooses Django is because the latter says he knows the Brittle Brothers, perhaps Schultz next move. As Django agrees to help Schultz in bounty-hunting, they first embark to confront the Brittle Brothers. Afterwards, it leads Django to become Schultz's associate in bounty-hunting across Texas. From there, Django discovers his forte: For wielding pistol in cowboy style, and shooting rifles (even magnum and shotguns) on intimate long range.Django also explains to Schultz that his wife Bloomhilda Von Shaft (Kerry Washington) is also sold in slavery in Mississippi. Her current owner is a man named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a plantation owner, and an audacious man. His slaves, probably the Mandingo people, are forced to fight each other. The duo plans a plot to rescue Bloomhilda from Candie by pretending to negotiate in buying one of his fight slaves, but consider in proposing to buy Bloomhilda instead. I imagine it to be very lucrative, but I also imagine Candie to be like Col. Hans Landa from Inglorious Basterds. The deal is terrifying and so is the suspenseful notion.Here is a film that looks absolutely fantastic, shot wonderfully but also superbly constructed from the ground up. The costume design and production values make a comeback in the likes of Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). Tarantino never hesitated to bring it back to life and keep piling all of what he likes on a Spaghetti Western flick. In addition, the Blaxploitation is stunningly awesome, with its over- the-top gritty performance, and of course the mayhem, and the \"n\" word madness. It is noticeable that one of QTs film trademark is quick zooms, and rotating camera pans from his collaborator DP Robert Richardson. In addition, the film is still successfully edited even though QTs collaborator in editing, the late Sally Menke wasn't there anymore. The film's vehemence is fresh but rather unoriginal. Tarantino wanted the violence to be relentless like his partner in crime Robert Rodriguez did with his Grindhouse (2007) feature header \"Planet Terror\". He planted the idea that stunt performers must have blood bags to imitate oozing gunshots and make it an extreme action exploit. But who cares, it's kind of fun ain't it? Black folks shooting all folks?Aside from the action, it also balances drama and romance. Think of it like the late Tony Scott's film \"True Romance\" (1993), where Tarantino made the script, and it came from his true voice. It was romantic and appealing, a story about a bimbo-cum-best-pal hooker and a man who falls in love with her. I love the impression that Tarantino made an actually romantic clash between Django and Bloomhilda. It's not just a freedom from slavery which actually historical, but it's also a deliverance from suffering and nightmare of being a slave.The actors made such winning performance as always. Leo DiCaprio, as I've said, steps in Christoph Waltz's much terrifying performance like that of being a Hans Landa on screen. He's terrifying as Candie, making him a solid Oscar contender for it. For Django, there're plenty of great black actors in mind, but I'm not saying that Jamie Foxx isn't the greatest. I accepted him for what he is as Django. His character is a comeback that the Django name in films must once more reign supreme. However, Sam Jackson is suited more like a comedian with a Southern accent in the film. His performance is somewhat inevitable, he dress as the good guy suspecting the protagonists as bad guys. But wow, what a performance.Django is probably the greatest smart-ass Spaghetti Western royale that Tarantino crafted. If not one of his greatest in the filmography, then it's one of his finest achievement ever since he became a director himself.",

            "content": "It has always been the characters, development of the characters during the film and the manipulation of the audience by emphasizing some details within the conversation, which fascinated me in Tarantino movies. From that point of view we see another successful movie with its Dr. King Schultz, Calvin Candie, Django Freeman and the first two eye catcher shooting scenes which show us the real Dr. King Schultz. However there are some negative comments to make without being 'nit-picking': It is not his 'crusade to ennoble violence' or some zooming, which has become his signature dish that I would like to criticize. It is rather the attempt to draw out the length of the movie -or script- with the help of multiple peek points to show more of the violence, more of clich\u00e9 Hollywood conversations and drama and commercial music so that the audience achieves multiple orgasms. Unlike 'There were will blood' (2007), which is another 160 minutes-film, 'Django' didn't have anything more to say after 130th minute. With 'Django' Tarantino has proved that he lost the cinematic sensitiveness and reached the point, where he is allowed to think that the audience would buy anything what he would show in the movie.",

That new western by QT\", yes I say, and they reply \"no, is it any good, I don't really like westerns\", well for all you people, put aside the fact that this film is a western, and GO SEE IT.I am not even a real die hard movie buff who considers writing reviews on movies, but a film this good deserves as much reviews as it can acquire. How would I describe this movie, it is simply to me Blazing Saddles meets Trinity, being \"They Call Me Trinity\" or \"Trinity is still my name\", if you have not heard of these two classic films, then look up Bud Spencer and Terence Hill here on IMDb.For those who have not seen the original Django with Franco Nero who has a cameo appearance in QTs new version, I would also suggest you give the original a viewing, I had to explain to most of my friends who I know have all seen \"The Harder They Come\" Django is the film they are all watching in the cinema, the guy with the mad machine gun. Lastly if you have not seen Blazing Saddles, you are either too young or just not into movies, as Blazing Saddles is also classic.Django ticks every box for me, as it has action, entertainment, great and at sometimes shocking as well as hilarious dialogue and Christoph Waltz doing yet again another great performance. I am not a fan of Jamie Foxx or Leaonardo DiCaprio, but as usual QT brings out the best in actors and I would happily watch this film more than once, even though is runs for over 160 minutes, which to be honest I did not even notice.I gave this film 9/10, and the only reason I dropped a rating was due to the thirty second hip hop track featured in this film performed by Rick Ross. Even though I love pumping a bit of Ross in the car, and it captured the moment for the particular scene in the film, it just felt out of place to me as Hip Hop nowadays is a bit plastic, still the same nonsense about my struggles, my drug selling, my bitches from super rich people, who have no problems but just don't know how to spend money properly, and promote a positive image, I prefer the beats and just ignore the rubbish they are saying. Bottom line, hip hop has no place in a Western like it also has no place in a Chinese Martial Arts movie like \"The Man With The Iron Fists\", but I won't go there, that is just my opinion, but other than that this film is the business.By the end of the movie, and the last song began to play before the credits rolled (a song also featured in Trinity), I knew QT had done it again, and to some people out there like myself Django will be seen as outstanding and bring back memories that were lost and forgotten from old classics like The Good, The Bad And The Ugly (starring Clint Eastwood) and other great spaghetti westerns. Nothing has come near to these great films of yesteryear, and if any film would make me start a Bluray collection of Spaghetti Westerns, Django has done it, Bravo, Bravo, Mr QT.",

The story was simple but well executed and characters were uncomplicated, yet entertaining. The highlight of the whole piece was the character of Dr. Schultz. His calm and collected persona enabled the story to flow with ease and made the movie seem much shorter than it actually was, which is a plus considering the 165 mins running time. Christoph Waltz definitely deserves all the praise he can get. Jamie Foxx and DiCaprio did well too. The only person I had a problem with was Django's wife Broomhilda. She really wasn't much of a character and didn't show much personality either. Kerry Washington might have tried, but it seemed to me that whatever scene she was in, she had this same pitiful look on her face that just made her slightly annoying.Overall, the film was entertaining, well paced and stylish (thanks to Waltz). Yes, the amount of blood used in the making of this movie would have been enough to stock several transfusion banks and the theatrical, almost indulgent detail into which Tarantino went to show the viewers his love of violence was a bit much at times. Yet, this film is in my opinion Tarantino's best so far. I found it enjoyable and ended up watching it twice in one week. Even the music used in this film was well chosen and gave it an edge",

            "content": "Review may contain spoilers (but not many, I suppose)OK, so I have just watched this movie and here are my thoughts.I think this movie is quite interesting but it's nothing I couldn't expect. Maybe because I was expecting just what I had seen? This is Tarantino - a mixture of gory bloody violence + some humour + incredible story. Well done, Mr Tarantino, you deserve all the praises givenFirst, pluses:1. Action. Action. Action. Did I mean , action? 2. Beautiful lips of Kerry Washington (Hildi). Seriously, true beauty. 3. Samuel L. Jackson - a class itself, heh, incredible character. 4. And many more, lots of funny dialogue lines + Mr Waltz in general, as well (but more on him later, in minuses...)Yet... minuses! There were some.1. Film is too long. I felt bored few times, I mean, not many times but I have found few scenes pretty dull (the \"shake my hand\", \"no I will not\", \"oh please, shake it or deal is not real\" etc , one of last scenes, what for??? not funny, I found it quite childish?). 30 minutes less and this movie would be way better.2. As for me, there is too much \"blood\", presented in just pathetic style. I felt like watching video game or some C-class movie, where ketchup = blood and the amount of this product is used in gallons, not mililitres. Well, I could expect it, but still, say - Reservoir Dogs is a CLASS movie also because violence is felt as true cruel violence and blood feels like blood and not like food product. Plus, D'Artagnan scene + dogs or this \"Mandingo\" fight in Candie's office = this is SICK, such scenes should not be in any movie. Or I am too weak, anyway, I could not watch it. Too cruel, pointless cruelty for sick people. SOrry.3. Mr Waltz - he is incredible all the way, but he had the same attitude, the way of talking etc., like... Col. Hans Landa! it was interesting in Incredible Basterds, but here - I know he can play other way and in also great style. Unfortunately he approached his character the same way as he did in Inglorius Basterds, in way less extensive but very similar manner. Well, still nice to see him, fantastic actor.OK, so I complained a little bit. But all in all, this movie is worth to watch, if you don't mind tonnes of ketchup-like blood and few scenes of incredible cruelty. My rate is 6/10. I won't give it 8/10 or more, as I reserve this for truly great movies and Django Unchained, although decent experience, is imho opinion, just decent, only decent movie.",

            "review_title": "Greatest Historical Movie of ALL TIME",
            "content": "Django Unchained, directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a story of a free slave transforming to a bounty hunter. Django, played by Jamie Foxx, and bounty hunter friend, Dr. Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz, go on a mission to free his wife, Broomhilda. A mix of comedy, action, and a history lesson make this a great movie which is supported by an all star cast. I believe that with the help of incredible acting, from the likes of Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, and Leonardo DiCaprio, Django Unchained is the most profane, yet informative movies of the century.\nThe movie Django Unchained is full of profanity, incest, and nudity. The n word alone is said at least once every minute, as everyone uses the n word being that the setting of the movie was a different time. When reaching Candie Land, we figure out that Calvin Candie's wife is actually his sister. This is because of the movies southern incest roots as Candie Land is based in New Orleans. Incest was never right I believe, but the inclusion of this topic was genius by Tarantino as it gives the watchers a basis of the setting. Candie, one of the biggest plantation owners in the Django Unchained universe, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio. There are also multiple instances in this movie where there is nudity. The viewer cannot see any profane body parts, Tarantino directed the actors to cover up in the movie to a certain degree, but the inclusion of nudity portrays how harshly slaves were treated in the south. One scene illustrates what slave owners did to their slaves when they tried to run away; Candie put Broomhilda in a hot metal casket shaped box outside as she laid there naked. The viewer can see the fear in Hildi's eyes as the white men pull her out of her metal box. The movie was not only full profanity, but there were also multiple instances where the violence in this movie may be too much for the faint hearted.\nDjango Unchained is so violent that from the violence alone, it could be rated R. A scene I want to highlight as violent comes from the beginning of the movie when Dr. King Schultz frees Django. Dr. Schultz was on a mission to find Django and get his help for a hunt on three brothers with a big bounty on their heads. But first, Dr. Schultz encountered a couple of white men who were transporting the slaves including Django. He first encountered them nicely, but when the white men did not want to comply with his terms, he shot and killed one and let the other bleed out. Christoph Waltz portrays the character of Dr. Schultz perfectly at this moment as he is nonchalant about killing these men as if he kills for a living. This sets up the story of Schultz being a bounty hunter and is a perfect transition into the story of Django and Dr. King. Another scene I would like to shine light upon is when Django is at Candie Land. We are introduced to the idea of Mandingo fighting. We see that a Mandingo fighter is trying to run away from Candie Land saying that he can not fight no more. Candie then sends the dogs at him and the dogs tear him into shreds and eat him. Although Mandingo fighters were a fictional idea conjured up for the movie specifically, this scene shows how hard it was for slaves creating a kill or be killed atmosphere for African Americans in the south. The violence in this movie is necessary to show all people of color how far we have come in America.\nAlthough the profanity and violence may be too harsh for viewers, Django Unchained portrays a message about how poorly African American slaves were treated at this time period. I believe that the main message of the movie is to show the adversity that slaves went through and that there were very few white men at this point who believed what they were doing as inhuman. In this movie, Tarantino portrays his message very well. Also, Schultz is like a father figure to Django as he frees him and trains him to be a killer. As the saying goes, \"money is power,\" and being a bounty hunter, killing fugitives was a very good occupation at the time. Schultz is like the police as he justifies the wrong doing of the evil. A second message Tarantino is trying to tell us is that love is a powerful thing. The whole plot of the movie is centered around Django's motivation to do whatever it takes to get his wife Hildi back and freed from slavery.\nOverall, Django Unchained was a movie that exposed the viewer to the problems of slaves. To this day, it is sad to think that not much has changed as many African Americans are still being racially profiled and being killed by racists. Django Unchained shows viewers the faults that we had in our America and reminds us to never do this once again to minorities today.",

It takes a lot for me to love a movie, especially a violent one.Sometimes you watch an almost 3 hour movie and feel it drags on way too long and scenes should have been cut, but the way this was written kept you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next the entire time. When things do happen, it's both unexpected and not so far fetched that you think \"impossible!\" Of course some of the script seems outlandish or exaggerated by today's standards, and it may be easy for some less aware individuals to think \"that wouldn't happen\", but in the era this was written, it all felt just right. Of course little bits and pieces gave it a modern edge, but for the most part it stuck to it's time period. There certainly were people exactly like DiCaprio's character in existence in the past and so it makes it that much more interesting and intense. Almost having a goal to \"expose\" how truly evil slavery and racism was. I felt this movie made even the \"unnecessary scenes\" interesting and enjoyable. The witty dialogue pushed the plot along and also gave you more information about characters. The characters were believable in that they did sometimes have moments of weakness, moments of hesitation, and also moments of haste. That gives it an even better sense of reality in my opinion when characters \"break character\". Real people are not always acting in one fluid character trait. The flashbacks were actually useful to the plot, not just a ploy that seem unrelated. You were given real reasons to root for the \"good guys\" and truly hate the \"bad guys\" other than \"here's the good guys and bad guys, now watch the violence\". Through the build up, it fully captures just how deep and evil slavery and racism was and pretty much takes you back in time to witness the current view of slavery and equality crush the old view of slavery and racism. I'll also add that I normally get sensitive when it comes to excessive or unnecessary violence in films and if the violence doesn't \"make sense\" as coming from the people we are supposed to believe as \"good\", it tends to frustrate me. I felt this movie overcame that \"ends justify the means\" pattern that many action movies seem to fall victim to. Knowing the way I feel about excessive and unnecessary violence in plot lines, I have never watched any of Quentin Tarantino's movies before knowing they are gory and violent, but decided to watch this one since it had such high accolades and went into it expecting to avert my eyes as needed or even turn it off. However, this felt different for me than an \"ends justify the means\" scenario and brilliantly placed the violence exactly where you wanted it to be and geared it to exactly who you felt \"deserved\" the violence.I am only sorry I haven't watched this particular one sooner as it has now become a serious contender for my favorite movie of all time. I am planning to watch a few more of his movies now to see if I like them just as much.",

            "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed the first 75% of the movie. Django (Jamie Foxx) the slave is bought by a German abolitionist bounty hunter, Dr King Schultz in the opening scene. Schultz is played by Christoph Waltz, who, in my opinion, did a fabulous job and is my favorite to win the Supporting Actor Oscar. After a year or so of bounty hunting, Schultz agrees to help Django find and free his wife, Broomhilda. They track her to Calvin Candie's plantation, \"Candie Land,\" where Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) watches slaves mandingo fight for entertainment. Django and Schultz travel there, under the cover of mandingo traders. Although they tell Candie they will return in five days to pay twelve thousand dollars for a mandingo fighter, they actually hope to buy Broomhilda on-the-spot (supposedly because Schultz wants someone to speak German with him) as a seemingly side-thought for a cheap price, and then never returning for the mandingo fighter. But, as in all movies, something goes wrong, and characters have to improvise.If you want to go see this movie, I highly recommend it. A few scene transitions were a little rough and confusing but it was okay in the end. I was interested and engaged, wondering if they were going to succeed, escape, make it out alive. I was only a little disgusted with the graphic and excessively violent shots, as though the movie makers were trying to show off their ability to make blood splash. From the first scene to the last, things explode, from people's heads to carts to houses. It didn't really bother me much though until a scene about 75% of the way through the movie. The entire scene consisted of blood splattering up the walls as shot after shot was fired, bullets graphically piercing flesh. I think it was a little extreme. I was also a little horrified with the nonchalant cruelty of the final scene. Otherwise, it was a fantastic movie, with a little bit of everything: terror, humor, thrill, excitement, strategy.Unless you get sick at the sight of blood, go see it.",

            "content": "The man that brought you Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds has struck gold once more with his near 3 hour work of art, Django Unchained. Django Unchained includes incredible performances from some of Tarantino's favorite actors like Jamie Foxx, Samuel L. Jackson, and Christoph Waltz. Tarantino keeps his signature long running time in Django, but trust me, you won't want it to be any shorter.\nThe film begins in the deep south, two years before the civil war. The movie simply prints this information in the opening scene, but not because the film is lazy, but rather because the setting is so vital to the story, it needs to be emphasized and obvious. In the opening scenes of the film we meet the two main characters; Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a skilled bounty hunter who uses his old career as a cover, and Django (Jamie Foxx), a rebellious, strong-willed slave with an unending desire to reunite with his lost wife. Dr. King Schultz approaches Django, who is heavily chained with a few other slaves, and uses some persuasive actions to get Django's old owners to sell Django to him, and thus their journey of vengeance, wealth, and unrelenting human spirit begins.\nAs the film is set in a time of immense racial divide, it easily works to serve as a mirror for America and what it used to stand for. The harsh, emotion evoking dialogue is felt right from the beginning of the film, as the n-word is used by white people in a shockingly common way. Tarantino uses this language to not only make it impossible for the viewer to forget they are in the 1850s, but also to make a statement about race, and how truly despicable some people were back in this era.\nThere is a point in the movie where some will likely think Tarantino went too far to show this racism, but I believe it was a perfectly crafted sequence that made the viewer feel the slaves' pain, as well as showcase character development in Dr. King Schultz. In this troubling scene, two of Calvin Candie's (Leonardo Dicaprio) are brutally fighting to the death with their bare hands. It is an extremely graphic and eye opening scene that will likely stir up controversy, as to whether or not it needed to be in the film. During the fight, the camera pans to Dr. King Schultz and he is pictured actually wincing for the two men that are being forced to fight. While this may seem like a normal reaction, it is actual out of the norm for those in the room, as everyone else who is watching, especially Calvin Candie, is somehow disgustingly into it, treating it like a normal sporting event. In the moment that he winces, we see how some people of that time knew how wrong slavery was. Dr. King Schultz is a man who had become completely callous to blowing someone's head off at point blank range, but here we see him deeply troubled by the unjust way slaves are treated. As tough to watch as the scene was, it served an important role in developing the movie's characters, as well as its worldly themes.\nThe dynamic that Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz created onstage is also something that needs to be praised. Christoph Waltz's character serves as somewhat of a father figure to a Jamie Foxx that is able to develop from a helpless slave to strong, independent, gun-slinging bounty hunter. Their journey is the main event of the movie and they nail it. Of course they receive some help later in the film from Decaprio, and the way he becomes completely immersed in the role of a ruthless plantation owner; which is seen best during the dinner scene and fighting scene toward the end of the film.\nDjango Unchained stands very well as another Tarantino classic. While it does great as a bloody old western film, it also brings the viewer through a sophisticated emotional journey pairing themes of remembering this horrible mistreatment of a race with men who showcase the undying and unrelenting nature humans have and will always have through the ages.",

The opening scene at the farm, for instance. It wasn't funny but perhaps the best scene I've ever seen in a Tarantino film. The film ended with cartoonish violence and showed we were all duped into actually caring. I thought it would difficult for Tarantino to overcome his puerile tendencies. So along comes Django and it takes five big steps back. No sense of truth, outrageous, crazy, entertaining for sure, but without that needed element of reality to support the audience's entry into a believable world. Without that assurance, we just are watching a stupid though interesting three-hour mess. There is no meaning in this movie, and though it tries to suggest it, it's merely the excuse to show us what the director really cares about. You can guess what that is.

Great soundtrack - so much so that during certain parts of the film I increased my volume so I could listen to the songs! Such an eclectic mix of songs which fit the film perfectly! 2. Fantastic cast - Christoph Waltz (amazing!) Leonardo Dicaprio (well we all know he is superb) and Samuel L Jackson really bought Daniel to life! But I must say (having never watched a film with him in before) Jamie Fox really surprised me. I didn't know what to expect from him, had only seen/heard him on the 'Gold Digger' song (which annoyed the hell out of me, maybe I avoided him on purpose) but as Django he was fantastic. Am certainly going to have to get my hands on more of his films! 3. Gore! Yes it has gore and for us gore fans it is sufficient enough to make us feel satisfied that we haven't been ripped off. It is what we have come to know from the master that is Mr Tarantino!! It is an engaging film, interesting and keeps your attention throughout.Inglorious: 8.3 Django Unchained: 8.5 - Sorry would have to say I preferred Inglorious (then again it did have more eye candy, Pitt and Roth, I am a girl after all!!) Favourite moment: Django's use of the gun when he holds it in one hand and flicks it with the other to shoot - I cried 'YEAH' when he did that!

His movies got weaker and weaker and even fans could only reply to critic with \"It is intentionally bad! It just makes fun of old movies.\" Same with this one. Most funny thing her is, that very young people are talking like this. People that never have seen an Italian western before but now defend this movie as an obeisance, a critical examination or an ironic view. It feels just like Tarantino has thrown some episodes together and found no way to combine them. Acting is really bad (yes yes, it's for sure intentionally bad like everything in this movie) except of Jamie Foxx and Leonardo Di Caprio and. Which is kind of funny, because normally I can't stand him and like Christoph Waltz. But Waltz' character was most times completely overacted like in some school play. Tarantions own small role stood out in relation to the rest: like a completely talent less actor. Man, do I miss the Tarantino of \"From Dusk till Dawn\" or \"Pulp Fiction\"...So: Story is a mess, acting is crap... what is there else to say? Well. The music score is a mixture of cinematic themes, pop music and hip hop. Does not fit as good as anywhere in the movie. Cutting was a mess too. Some cuts where extremely hard and just done badly.Only cam was quite good, there were some really nice pictures. And the overall theme of slavery and how everyone took their side in this dark times (yes, even the white \"missus\" did take their role of shame) let me give a 6.This movie is neither a obeisance to the old Italien western nor is it a critical examination nor an ironic view. It's just took some elements and mixed them up quite bad. If it really was intentional it does not make a better movie. It's like making a gross hamburger to make fun of fast food and then expecting people to eat it with pleasure. Which will be done by all the Tarantino fans out there. No matter how bad their idol cooks, how bad the burger tastes or how messy it looks: they will love it because it's made by their idol. For the rest of us: good there are much better restaurants our there. Including the old traditional Italian Pizzeria where you can get a real \"Django\" if you want to. Without any erupting blood fountains, they are nowhere to be seen in this movie from 1966.",

            "review_title": "A wild trip back through time with some of Hollywood's greatest actors and one of Hollywood's greatest directors!",
            "content": "After becoming Martin Scorsese's mole and making great American classics with Scorsese (2004's The Aviator, 2006's The Departed, and, as some people agree, 2002's Gangs of New York and 2010's Shutter Island), Leonardo DiCaprio has gone on to work with another Hollywood great, the man inspired by DiCaprio's mole in Scorsese: Quinton Tarantino.The outcome is Django Unchained, which unites DiCaprio and Tarantino in a much-awaited collaboration, along with a powerful ensemble cast supporting both DiCaprio and Tarantino: Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz (making his sophomore collaboration with Tarantino three years after Inglorious Basterds), Samuel L. Jackson (marking Jackson's fourth collaboration with Tarantino, following Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and Kill Bill: Volume 2), Kerry Washington, Don Johnson, and, for a cameo appearance, Franco Nero (for those of you unfamiliar with Nero, Nero is the man who played the head villain in both Die Hard 2 and Force Ten From Navarone). The story stars Foxx as Django, a slave in Texas who, many years ago, was sold apart from his wife, Broomhilda (Washington). Broomhilda has gone on to a Southern plantation in Mississippi, owned and controlled by an infamous and cruel slave owner named Calvin J. Candie (DiCaprio). The minute that Django is rescued by a German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Waltz), he seizes control of the opportunity to rescue Broomhilda. Before reaching that point, however, Django and Dr. Schultz are going to go through Hell and back. And they may (knowingly) never escape up against the cruel and manipulative, yet brilliantly smart tactics used against them by Calvin J. Candie and his fellow slave owners.For the two and a half hours given to us by Tarantino, we find ourselves on a wild trip back through time. For having shot Django Unchained between 2011-2012, Tarantino gives the film a perfect look and atmosphere of the year 1858 (when the picture takes place). The buildings, the streets of dirt, the clothes\u0085everything looks impeccably like it is 1858. The plantations in Tennessee (used for Don Johnson's character of \"Big Daddy\") and Mississippi (used for Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin J. Candie character) are beautiful and look not only old-fashioned, but also just as you would expect for Southern plantations to look like (trust me-I'm a Southerner!) The adventure that all of Tarantino's characters go through in Django Unchained are pretty fun as well, and they have great humor to them. Who could ever forget Don Johnson leading a team of men who have trouble with the sheets used by the Ku Klux Klan, or a slave referring to a slave owner as \"snowball\" and getting away with it?!!?!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!!?!?!?!?! All of the actors execute both the comedy and the suspense impeccably. Leonardo DiCaprio shines in one of his first performances as a villain (and the villain whom Tarantino claims he had the most trouble bringing to life on the big screen, compared to every other villain character he has ever created). DiCaprio and Tarantino, together, bring to life an honest portrayal of the cruelty of many slave owners (next to those who provided an education for their slaves and never even beat them).In spite of all of the good, there will be many people upset by Django Unchained. Spike Lee is one of them (while his criticism is understandable, please remember that Mr. Lee has not actually seen the picture\u2014and says that he is not going to, saying that seeing the picture would be disrespectful to his ancestors who were all slaves). You have Tarantino's constant use of the \"N\" word\u2014which is honest to the picture, of course, but always brings an uncomfortable feeling when it is used by a non-African American director. Much of the cruelty inflicted upon the slave characters in Django Unchained is very brutal, and a \"little bit too much.\" Entertainment? The picture itself is, but a few scenes are a bit too harsh for entertainment.Regardless, Tarantino does not glorify the \"N\" word, but instead uses it to give an honest depiction of what things were like back in the south in 1858. They say that \"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\"\u2014and both Jamie Foxx and Samuel L. Jackson have come out and said that they understand Tarantino's material for what it is as a picture, and for what it is not: a picture glorifying racism. Next to this, many of the slave characters of Django Unchained, when in peril, find happy endings. And the end is happy as well.Django Unchained is not for everyone. Regardless, if you are a fan of Tarantino, DiCaprio, and/or western pictures, you will most likely find yourselves in for a great treat.",

Even Kerry Washington's role was not a small one, because her purpose in the film with limited speaking roles really captured the viewer. Her role was so important to the character of Django that there has to be a great female actress to take on the real and she was perfect for it. The accents of comedy throughout the film in a sense relieved a small amount of the tension that was developed from the portrayal of blacks, whites, slaves, and masters in the early south. I think the grit and brutality of the film gave the film so much more life and Tarantino was definitely the guy to put that together and I commend him for it. Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson were great and very convincing in their roles making them either very unlikable or vice-versa. Personally, I feel that Samuel L. Jackson in front of the camera and Tarantino behind it is a combination of greatness because together they make great films.

It kept true to all that is Tarantino, whilst (in my opinion) offering an enjoyable storyline that kept me wholeheartedly interested.Then came the scene where Waltz shoots Di Caprio (if you've seen it you'll know the scene) and the ridiculous gun battle breaks out with everyone in the house getting killed (except Django, of course). I just found this part of the story, for lack of a better word, stupid.

I fully expected pulp fiction-esque jumping around on the plot line but this stayed as true to an old fashioned western story telling style. Foxx's character was great. I think Christopher Schultz really stole the show, though. His way of killing people with a grin really solidified him as a bounty hunter. Some of the Kill Bill style sound effects were annoying though, I think they didn't really add anything to the theater experience. I wish they would have come up with an original, identifiable score so that once this plays on cable in a few years, you wouldn't be able to mistake the music. Some of the scenes where actual songs were used, especially the hip hop song lost me. I prefer the music to match the time period for the most part. I though Leo's character was OK, not great. His terrible southern accent came off as campy. I expected more mandango fighting scenes, at least one bout style fight would have been cool. Watching the guys wrestle around on the parlor floor was underwhelming to me. If they would have done it in a tobacco drying barn or something with a cast of other mandango fighters and owners I think it would have been more believable. I liked Stephen, Samuel Lee Jone's character but he didn't get enough screen time. Some parts of the movie were really slow. The mask scene was hilarious and clever but went on about 2 minutes too long. Doesn't sound like much but once the joke is over, stop beating that dead horse! The cinematography left something to be desired. Some of the scenes could have been much more interesting if we cut out some of the close ups, stood back and really showed the grandness of the pre-war south. The place looks run down and the war hasn't even happened yet. Anyway the dialogue was pretty good, I didn't really hear any liners that are useful like tarintino's other films but I've also only seen it once so there might be some that stick with me after I see it next time. Overall, not a bad way to spend $8 but not on the same level as reservoir dogs or pulp fiction.",

            "review_title": "Django Unchained: Movie Review",
            "content": "Django Unchained is quintessential Quentin and it delivers in a way only Tarantino can deliver. As with all of his directorial endeavours, Tarantino fittingly adopted a shackles are off, anything goes mentality. This mentality in the case of Django Unchained effectively translated on-screen to a gripping, extravagant, bloodthirsty, perfectly paced, often-humorous escapade with a serious political undercurrent that is thoroughly enjoyable. It is most definitely history altering, indulgent, audacious and continually outrageous, but it does make for spectacular viewing.Django Unchained is a Spaghetti Western genre mash-up written and directed by Quentin Tarantino set in America's Deep South in the year 1858, two years before the Civil War. It follows Django, a slave given his freedom by a German-born dentist-turned-bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz, due to Schultz requiring Django's assistance in identifying the murderous and ruthless Brittle brothers. Whilst sharpening up on his bounty hunting skills, taught by Schultz, Schultz comes to learn about Django's wife, Broomhilda and his desire to track down and rescue her from captivity. Their adventure eventually steers them in the direction of a plantation, Candyland and its brutal proprietor, Calvin Candie, who Django and Schultz come to learn to be Broomhilda's current owner. Masked with an entirely fabricated charade, Django and Schultz gain access to Candyland but a bitter and hateful house slave called Stephen becomes wary of their true intentions.Christoph Waltz as the witty bounty hunter with a history in dentistry, Dr. King Schultz is the standout performance of the film, on top of several other excellent character portrayals, notably Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of brutally villainous yet subtly charming plantation owner, Calvin Candie. It is important to add however that the heavyweight performances given by Waltz and DiCaprio do in no way over-roar or overshadow Jamie Foxx's slave-turned bounty hunter, Django, he more than holds his own when it could have been so easy to have slipped under the radar and be forgiven, given that the cast assembled for this movie is so stacked. Samuel L. Jackson is the despicable, bitter and foulmouthed bootlicker house slave Stephen. Jackson and DiCaprio characterize a certain rapport between one another, this tells of a significant backstory between Stephen and Candie, which adds even more to the movies already substantial intrigue. However, Kerry Washington seems at times slightly insipid and a bit bland as Broomhilder, especially for a Tarantino movie, but she ups her game when necessary. With historical emphasis placed on Quentin Tarantino's last outing in that of Inglourious Basterds and on his latest project, Django Unchained, what immediately springs to mind is this guy would have been a cool history teacher. Only Tarantino could address Nazi Germany and pre-Civil War human trafficking so elaborately in successive films. Django unchained similar to Inglourious Basterds is a quirky, unconventional somewhat peculiar look at Quentin Tarantino's view of history. This movie provides an alternate depiction of the unapologetic world of human trafficking and slavery in the Antebellum Era of America's Deep South. Tarantino constantly reinvents fictional story-telling and takes it to a whole new level, Django Unchained is no different.As the film progresses it does not suffer from its 2 hour 46 minute running time. Given the considerably lengthy running time you would think your attention and will-power would be tested, however Tarantino has an ingenious way of making often over-the-top and sometimes excessive erudition engrossing and absorbing; a character building ploy that can be hit or miss, but Tarantino seems to hit it out of the park more often than not.The landscape of the movie is changed with a single handshake but the dynamic remains consistent, with the conflicting motives of love and revenge driving the film to an ultra-violent, blood-soaked conclusion. In this midst of this, Tarantino injects himself into proceedings just as it is conceivable that the movie is calming down somewhat, however, it manifested to be that this was simply the calm before the blood drenched storm. In addition to this, just as you think the movie is reaching a natural plateau, it immerses you in yet more blood-splattering action that will keep you hooked until the end and will leave you devilishly wanting more when it's over. It is important to profess nevertheless that the more pedestrian moments do not hurt the movie in any way attributable to Tarantino's knack of being able to gradually build tension and intrigue. On the contrary, it is also understandable that this movie may not be to everyone's taste, given its uncompromising and unrelenting in-your-face nature. Riddled with racially charged profanity it is easy to see why some people may take offence, and therefore not engage fully with what the film is trying to convey. Does Django Unchained transgress and at times cross the line? Certainly, but Tarantino has made a career out of crossing the proverbial line, and his expertly placed humour helps to soften the blow so to speak.When all is said and done, it ultimately boils down to a significantly important movie about pre-Civil War slavery, executed in a cartoonish, unorthodox yet alluring fashion befitting of the movies outlandishly eccentric dialogue, extraordinary settings and charismatic character portrayals.As with the other screenplay scripts Tarantino has penned, Django Unchained's dialogue is uniquely erudite and provoking in the best sense of the word; and also intelligently witty particularly for Dr. King Schultz's dialogue. The cinematography is outstanding, the lighting is fitting to each scene, and the satirical, parody-like whip sounds and sudden zooming in that are customary with old school westerns are just brilliant. Django Unchained is also stylistically revolutionary; the striking costume designs are daring and radical but all unquestionably add to the originality of the film. The soundtrack is superb; it captures the essence of the movies unabridged flamboyance and greatly compliments the ambiance and mood of each scene.",

This is probably the cause for some of it). It didn't deserve a 18 rating. Story line followed a plot which was obvious, seen most of it coming. The camera work was fantastic throughout and really added to the western theme. The slavery side to it was brilliant, shown a slavery in the light it should be - As a disgusting abusive thing. Jamie Foxx was alright, but I have seen better people play the roles of slaves/ex-slave. At points he shown far to much \"ghetto\" for someone who had just left slavery. Christoph Waltz was incredible though. His acting was brilliant and his role was hilarious in each scene. Samuel Jackson was brilliant too, an the effects to make him look 76 were brilliant. Dicaprio was obvious incredible too.Thinking back to they hype, it wasn't the greatest film ever. It didn't inspire me or anything. Was just alright to watch really. Has nothing on some other films which stay with you for a week afterwards because they were so good.About a 7/10 - maybe 8/10 if I am being generous. Was a decent film though.

The only thing he wants back is his beloved wife, but ends up facing brutal violence, harsh negotiating, and formidable plantation owners. The fiery revenge in Django's attitude throughout the film gives the feeling that he might explode at any given second, yet he somehow fastens it to a leash. He is an attentive, patient, yet zealous man slowly making his way from the bottom to the top.

            "content": "I don't typically enjoy Quentin Tarantino movies, but this one is easily my favorite. Christoph Waltz , Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio all do some amazing stuff. Rescuing a slave to help him track down a trio of outlaws, a German bounty hunter then forms a partnership with him and they set about finding and freeing his wife from servitude. Although it seems like more genre hopping from Quentin Tarantino, this western is really once again an exploitation-based revenge fantasy. But let's face it, one can have little sympathy for both the Nazis of Inglourious Basterds and the sadistic slavers of Django Unchained and so even the most lily-liveried and liberal of us can get a cheap thrill out of experiencing some brutal retribution as we watch the down-trodden and exploited rise up to become a total bad-ass! Jamie Foxx is super-cool as a kind of be-Stetsons Shaft and Christophe Waltz is his usual brilliant self whose gentleman killer is the one outsider who questions the morality of buying and selling other human beings. Leonardo DiCaprio also obviously relishes the role of the mustache-twirling villain and Samuel L. Jackson's ultimate Uncle Tom is possibly even more hiss able and worthy of a bloody come-tuppence. The prolific use of the N-word may be off-putting for some but it becomes almost Blazing Saddles level silly, and one of the funniest scenes parodying the KKK could be straight out of Mel Brooks' film. As always seems to be the case with Tarantino's films these days, it could've stood to be half an hour shorter and it lacks the spark of genius that marked his earlier work, but Django Unchained is still a highly entertaining revenge western pastiche with enough bloody violence to make Sam Peckinpah proud Watch Django online streaming on Megastream go to http://goo.gl/Ic4CGW",

            "content": "Django Unchained is a movie written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx and although these are the two main actors in this movie. The real star is Tarantino himself.The movie takes place two years before the American civil war and is about a bounty hunter, Christoph Waltz's character who frees a slave called Django ,played by Jamie Foxx, because he needs his help with a bounty. One thing leads to another and they become partners and team up and go to try free Django's wife from slavery.This movie is typical Tarantino. Everything oozes Tarantino; the dialogue, the shots, the music. This is everything you'd expect from a Tarantino movie and he is truly the star of the movie. Jamie Foxx plays a freed slave, Django, and is great in the movie. He doesn't have much dialogue due to the nature of his character but everything he does deliver, coupled with his persona and the way he carries himself throughout the movie is fantastic. Christoph Waltz plays the bounty hunter who frees him and deserves the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor 100%. He is brilliant in this movie and the chemistry between him and Django is great and can be put down to the acting but also the writing. They form a witty, funny and badass pair.Leonardo DiCaprio plays the main villain in the movie and does fantastically in this different role and in my opinion, should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Samuel L. Jackson plays DiCaprio's house servant in the movie and is both as evil as DiCaprio's character but also is hilarious and steals every scene he is in. So, you have Christoph Waltz who is a scene stealer, DiCaprio who is a scene stealer and Samuel L. Jackson who is a scene stealer in a scene together. This is an example of why I love Tarantino. He is a rock star of the movie industry.The action in this movie is typical Tarantino and over the top and mostly quite hilarious but it can also be quite uncomfortable which isn't a negative, it's just a point. For me the job of a movie is to promote a reaction from the audience, whatever that reaction may be and Tarantino does great here.The movie could have been said to be a tad long but when I thought about it there wasn't a single scene which I could think of that I thought should have been removed. So when that happens...you can't complain about length. Tarantino movies are an event and the more the better as far as I'm concerned.Django Unchained is a fantastic movie, classic Tarantino over the top goodness and is well worth a watch9/10",

            "content": "What I ABSOLUTELY loved was Tarantino getting blown up. I have never seen a film before where the Director making a cameo appearance gets blown up in the film.The first act was really good and I enjoyed the relation between the Dentist (don't know who to write the character's name and the Dentist seems right) and Django building up. Was handled really well, and didn't look at all forced. To some the first act may appear to drag on but not to me ... I was a little disappointed when the movie moved into Second Act. I really enjoyed the first act so much. The only gripe I have about the first act, is it doesn't really explain why the Dentist, cares so for Django. I mean I get that he wanted help get some bounties and since Django helped him with that he wants to help Django in return, but that he would go so out of the way to help him find his wife, all cos of what his wife was named, was well ... you know. I figured it would perhaps tie in with another bounty and that the Dentist had gotten some clue from the fact that the wife spoke German that we was not letting slip at that point. Anyway the point is apart from this tiny gripe I loved the first act.The second act was even better, and apart from Tarantino blowing up, the strongest part of the film. I am so sry I keep going on and on about Tarantino, but I just loved that bit. Returning back to the point, the second act was brilliant. Leading upto the scene at the Dinner table and the scene with Candy ready to sawing through that Skull. That build up was fantastic. I was greatly excited with how the movie would go from here on.The movie till that point was like one giant game of Chess and so far the Dentist and Django had played very well, and clearly had the upper hand in the game. Closing in totally unknown to the opponent on check mate. However now Candy knew the game and suddenly he knew had held all the cards ... it just sets up the third act beautifully. I was really intrigued. What will Candy to next.The next move was of course Candy's man barges through a door and points a gun at the Dentist and Django and that disappointed me a little. I mean sure it was a great move to make, but it was clear that the chess game was now up. Think of this way, you are watching a game of chess and then suddenly one of the two players picks out a gun and points it at the other guys head and says, who wins? There is no doubt who won, but that is not playing chess anymore. The \"chess\" game between the Dentist and Candy was great to watch, and it abruptly finished. I would have liked Candy to respond in a \"chess\" move way and not go all guns blazing. However, what he did also worked like a charm.So the price for the slave girl was 12000 USDs and the Dentist. flips out the money in a flash and this is where I have my only other real gripe with the movie. Remember how I said earlier that the Dentist appeared to be going out of his way to help Django. I at the time thought that this may lead in with some bounty, but what the Dentist did just didn't go in with the bounty hunter that he had been built up to be. I mean he was parting with 12000 USDs of his hard earned bounty to get a guy some love !! Seemed out of character, or well beyond limit. I mean I would understand him helping Django till that point, but that he would happily dish out 12000 USDs in flash seemed to cross that line.However the part that follows is sheer genius. Beautifully we see how two men let their prides take control of themselves. One whose pride has been hurt and who is looking to restore some of it, and another who wants to gloat. The deal has taken place all they have to do is walk out of there and both men will live, but as I said, pride got in the way of all that. I loved the build up to that and I could totally understand the Dentist just shooting Candy. Gloat not you a$$hole.However after this, it went all western on me. Just lots of shooting and not much happening plotwise, but then again most of the plot had already happened, all that remained was to close the story. Tarantino did that in fine style. The payoff was watching the Butler getting shot off and being left to be blown up. Samuel Jackson totally stole the show. Easily the best performance of the movie. Though Waltz was great as well. On a side note did Django have to shoot Candy's Sister, what had she done !! Having said this the third act was the weakest of the movie. I would have really enjoyed Candy stringing along the Dentist and Django in a more \"chess\" like manner than forcing them to lose with a gun in their faces. Candy just showed his cards too soon. Also while I really liked the tension building up, once the papers are signed, but the third act is mostly just shooting and more shooting and I felt that a bit more story and a little less shooting could have been added to the third act.All in a all a great movie ... with some super acting. Waltz and that Butler totally stole the show. Di Caprio and Foxx were great. The film has a lot of what Tarantino is best at, and that is STYLE.",

I liked everything before that point, though. It was very stylistic, it was humorously violent and dark, and I actually payed attention to everything the characters were saying. Once they traded for Broomhilda, the movie should've ended. It should have only been a few minutes after that point to wrap up the film. I talked to a lot of people about Django after I saw it, and one of my friends made a sound observation that the last third of the film was more under the control of Jamie Foxx than Tarantino, and the quality dragged because of it. It was slower paced and had less clever dialogue. A lot of reviewers here have already made their observations about how unrealistic the ending was, so I'll leave it alone. I have a similar dilemma with 'Gladiator' in that I despise the first half-hour of it, much like I can't stand the last third of Django, so I never watch the whole thing. Still, I like when Tarantino actually lead production and I absolutely love DiCaprio's character.

            "content": "Hopping aboard the Quentin Tarantino train often carries a certain burden and expectation. You see, the burden often appears when dealing with his hysterical, complex and down-right ridiculous and suggestive vernacular that some people become instantly offended by. The expectation enters and creates the coupling with the overall screen time of his endeavors, which causes some to display the supreme disrespect, by walking out of the theater. Both cinematic styles obviously attract a certain type of moviegoer, however over the years Tarantino has been perfecting his craft; thus causing more fans to gravitate to his pictures.In the case of his past films, he's succeeded quite often, while sometimes the length can pummel the picture directly into the subterranean abyss; amidst the analytical dialogue and witty exchanges. When the combined elements of his pictures come together in harmony, his directorial efforts are hard to match, let alone exceed. The casting choices boost his films with a dynamic nature that is a rarity at best these days. We, as audience members, have played host to his magnificence, with such originals as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Inglourious Basterds, and the characters that propel these film to greatness, such as Lt. Aldo Raine, Colonel Hans, The Bride, Butch Coolidge, Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield.As the 2012 year draws to a close, Tarantino and The Weinstein Company have brought us a dazzling gem of a film that reinvents the dried-out Spaghetti Western genre, into something big, bold and boisterous. True, the picture can seem a bit too lengthy and drawn out, however the character development, cinematography, set pieces and a vivid three act paradigm make this an instant classic, unlike anything predating it.Christoph Waltz had his coming-out party as Colonel Hans (Inglourious Basterds), which notably earned him an Oscar nod, however seeing his individualistic and stylistic monologues implemented into a paragon role, is something we've all been waiting for. Sure, the renegade is loveable in a dark, twisted and carefree way, but now that he has revealed his portrayal of Dr. King Schultz, it's unclear which role he's better at, which speaks to his overall talent bursting at the seams.It should not go without mentioning Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson and of course, Jamie Foxx. DiCaprio's shining example of a true bias southern slave and plantation owner is remarkable, while 'Sammy Jacks' plays off this role as the loyal and all but sullen family butler/caretaker. Together the two lay the groundwork for red lining of the film, which ultimately Jamie Foxx's Django overcomes and shreds to pieces - a true thing of beauty to behold.The most interesting and tactful thing about Foxx's starring role is he simply plays off of the amazing performance of Waltz. There are many moments where Waltz dominates the dialogue, however as the story progresses, it is made clear who the plot is about - Django and Broomhilda, while Waltz assists. Waltz is cementing himself as an actor who boosts the success of his co-stars and even the protagonist, and this is as admirable as it is difficult.Overall the film was spectacular and will cement itself as an instant classic. The combined efforts of each star will be remembered as one of the best collaborations Tarantino has brought together in his directorial history. The most intriguing aspect of the film will be the lasting impact of the minuscule genre moving forward, and if it will flourish, or remain in the shadows.",

            "content": "In Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, there is a scene in which Django (Jamie Fox), soon after being freed by the incredibly likable dentist turned bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), shops for new clothes to wear.Schultz tells Django to pick out whatever he likes. Django looks at the smiling white man in disbelief. You're gonna let me pick out my own clothes? Django can't believe it. The following shot delivered one of the biggest laughs from the audience I watched the film with. After the white man confirms that yes, he is indeed letting the black man pick out his own clothes, we cut to a wide shot of Django riding his horse, now decked out in his very own (outlandish) cowboy outfit-an all blue with white ruffle get-up.It's a great little scene that provides humor and allows the viewer to further warm up to the two main protagonists. But it also does more than that. It's a simple scene that speaks for the whole film. It's an affirmation that this man of color is now free and able to make his own decisions. The choice he made concerning his extravagantly loud outfit acts as a warning to those that plan to stand in his way-watch out, here I come, I ain't gonna be quiet no more.And the humor the scene provides echoes the entire film-it wants us to get comfortable with our hero. Tarantino knows that a man of color makes an unconventional hero in a revenge- flick-that's why he made the film. When was the black man going to get his revenge film? It's been long overdue. With Django Unchained, that film has finally arrived and it has arrived in style. Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and meticulously written, it's Tarantino at his most epic.",

            "content": "I understand that some people might not agree with this review. It is undoubtedly biased as I strongly dislike Tarantino (though this is my favourite of his films).Don't get me wrong - this film has its merits. The beginning of the movie is relatively enjoyable and follows a well-written but poorly directed story. Towards the end, however, things fall apart and Django's actions even disagree with his character. It becomes an unpleasant viewing experience and I was left wishing that the script would have been given to someone else, as the movie could have been so much better.Everything from the comedy to the violence is disappointing, and - though I understand that it is supposed to convey the style of, and pay homage to, the old Spaghetti Westerns - it fails to remind me of any previous Western that I've seen. In addition, the main roles are poorly acted, with the exception of Monsieur Candy (Leonardo DiCaprio), which is a real shame. A good actor can save a poor film (take the Bourne Ultimatum, for example), but Tarantino doesn't seem to appreciate that. DiCaprio's monologue was the only part of the film I genuinely enjoyed, and I wish he had been cast in a larger role (such as Django's sidekick and mentor). As usual, the director makes his own characteristic appearance, which is as out-of-place as ever.Django Unchained comes across as a crass, unentertaining mess, which almost made me leave the theatre half way through. I am quite surprised at some of the reviews I have seen on here, but perhaps I don't understand it fully. Nevertheless, my view is this: Django's Unchained isn't worth watching (other than for DiCaprio's impressive monologue).",

            "content": "Now a criticism of an old Spaghetti Western or World War II action film was likely to be that the dialogue was weak and the characters were poorly developed and both were obviously secondary to the action scenes. Of course in a Tarantino film the characters and the dialogue become the show and the action is secondary. So it is in Django Unchained. As Inglourious Basterds was not at all like Enzo Castellari's Inglorious Bastards, Django Unchained is not Sergio Corbucci's Django...although Franco Nero does make a brief throw away appearance in the film to wink at the use of the name Django.In a way Nero appearing in the film is the key to understanding what Django Unchained and what Tarantino's filmmaking career is really all about...a love of movies. Tarantino may not have the best taste in film, he may overindulge his love for B or Z grade pictures but he seems to do so in the spirit of a young Orson Welles who once described making motion pictures at a film studio by exclaiming \"This is the biggest electric-train set any boy ever had!\" What is any Tarantino film really about above all else...simple...it's about movies and his unabashed love of them. It is why I laugh a little when people start to point out historical inaccuracies and anachronisms in his period films Inglourious Basterds and now Django Unchained. Tarantino is not making films about actual history and he flaunts that fact. Nor is he making films that are intended to seriously comment on the Holocaust or slavery.Tarantino is making films about film history and commenting on how movies in the past have addressed these subjects. One thing we all know about movies is in general they are concerned in most cases less with accuracy and realism than they are with drama, artistic license, and ticket sales. Truths in movies are often not revealed by telling a true and accurate story but rather by artistically opening up an event to allow an audience to use their imaginations to experience the emotions of that event through the characters.Here's where you go through the looking glass in a Tarantino film...his characters are not playing emotions inspired by any kind of true event but rather emotions inspired by other movie characters and how these movie characters and other movies inspired Tarantino to create the ones in his own films.So, in a Tarantino film you are in a \"movie world\" that was inspired by other \"movie worlds\" pretty much leaving any comparison to the real world pointless. This is why anything can and pretty much does happen in a Tarantino film...he has freed himself from any rules of realism.To give you an example of how Tarantino's mind works in this way in Django Unchained the characters he created Django and Broomhilda Von Shaft are supposed to be the relatives/great or great great grandparents of John Shaft...yes, that John Shaft...the one played by Richard Roundtree in the 1971 film Shaft.When you understand that Tarantino is showing us the story of the great great grandparents of John Shaft and using a pile of references to other films to do so you begin to see how ridiculous it is that a person discussing this film would concern themselves with historical accuracy and anachronisms. I'm sure the fictional John Shaft is not rolling over in his celluloid grave about how Tarantino portrayed his great great grandparents...of course in Tarantino's mind John Shaft might have a score to settle, ha! So, in this Southern Fried Spaghetti Revenge Western Tarantino has dreamed up, his German dentist bounty hunter Doc Schultz and Django - the slave he sets free to help him complete a job - wander through a candy colored world that seems part Blazing Saddles, part Mandingo (the 1975 Richard Fleischer film) and part Euro-Western as seen through the eyes of a young video store clerk that seems fascinated to have discovered this strange, vulgar, and exploitive movie universe.This really is not a story about a slave taking revenge on those that enslaved him but rather a story about a couple of movie characters taking revenge for the things that happened in the film Mandingo.",

This was the case in this movie BUT was savagely broken by a couple of scenes 2) Good film making is, like good literature, theatre, poetry, pretty much any creative work about EMPATHY. Do not spend a long amount of anyone's time doing generating this empathetic feeling -then destroy it in a scene.This is where the editor comes in.The film fell apart in the last few scenes and a film I was really beginning to love fell into farce.

Completely moronic, and this results in an escalation of violence where the shooter himself and five other guys get killed. Uh uh. This is comic book level folks, come on. Fourteen year old kids will probably like it. I expect more from a movie, ideally I hope to forget everything around me and get sucked in the story.

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's mastery of the cinematic form is impressive, even inspiring, and his encyclopedic knowledge of film history - specializing in more obscure, less mainstream genres - informs his every frame with a stunningly rich vibrancy. Early in his career he was accused of outright theft of entire scenes from many of his cherished genre films, but as his art has progressed he has more deftly and subtly appropriated his curious sources into his own work. In Django Unchained Quentin is entirely in command of his inspirations as even his most blatant nods to other Western (or Southern) films are now so thoroughly re-imagined and re-crafted into his own vision that he's no longer guilty of any such petty crimes. No, his cinematic action is now all entirely his own. But in spite of the genuine draw dropping creativity on display throughout the entire film, there's still something seriously wrong. I'm referring to the violence in Tarantino's films, which is often exceptionally graphic. Quentin has claimed that his use of sensational violence as a cinematic element is no more questionable than a Hollywood musical's use of singing or dancing. I wish I could agree with him, that graphic, gory, extreme violence in a film is no more objectionable an element than a high kicking chorus line, but that's a ridiculous idea.Violence, by the fact of its deeply primal impulse, resonates in the audience in a very distinct, particular way. Whenever something exceptionally brutal occurs in a film I find myself instinctively reminding myself that it's just a movie, that it isn't real, and this of course takes me right out of the moment. I become aware that I'm watching a filmed cinematic expression of violence. This is not a good thing for a medium whose magical power is wholly dependent upon sustaining its delicate illusions. Django Unchained worked as a fantasy only as long as I was willing and able to suspend my disbelief, but its gratuitous, over the top violence repeatedly shook me from the dream.Quentin has spoken to the fact that the actual violence experienced by real slaves was often much worse, much more shocking than what he has depicted, and this is very true. But the reality of the existence of gruesome violence in our mad, mad world is not justification enough to celebrate its romanticized, sensationalized recreation. If horrendous film violence isn't an inherently exploitative element in its own right, cynically preying upon that part of us that defies reason and decency, then those crappily made graphic exploitation films from which Tarantino draws much of his inspiration would never have made a nickle profit. But they did and still do, so cinematic violence for its own sake is an irrationally intoxicating force that, like graphic pornography, overwhelms any artistic or philosophical concerns. Whatever cleverness or ingenuity or seeming sensitivity his films express, they are somewhat undone by their own shameless antisocial depravity.As a mature, intelligent, enlightened individual, Tarantino disappoints me with his continued fixation on the emotion of revenge and in extracting it in the most savage methods possible. He has wallowed in this revenge mode for the past 3 or 4 films, and though he's managed to somehow raise the already high bar of his creative and technical cinematic mastery with this film, I feel he's dropping the ball with his continuing adolescent preoccupations. So while artistically and technically this film is a solid nine I must deduct two full points for the indulgent and irresponsible violence. Though he does it with superior style and bravura Tarantino splatters his films with way too much grim, lurid, sensational violence. I believe that a more violent culture is a symptom of a less healthy society. There's no law against the excessive, psychopathic, unrepentant display of violence in film, but it is a crime that Quentin now allows it to degrade his otherwise masterful art.",

That is what a hero is about. Rounding out a tremendously talented cast are also Kerry Washington, who portrays a damsel in distress, if you will, which is very different from other characters that we have seen her portray. An obvious favorite of Tarantino's, Samuel L. Jackson is cast to play a very controversial character and Leonardo DiCaprio is the necessary evil to Django's hero.

The movie is definitely long and you know it very well while watching the movie but anyhow you don't feel its length much. Since it has a very good story line and its basically a love story which makes it more interesting with all action and blood splattering scenes. I still don't understand how violently people are killed in Quentin Tarnatino's movies only and you don't find such blood splattering in any other movies when a person is shot. But again the overall experience was nice and I had a good time watching this movie which I would say is a classic from Tarantino. Background score is good and adds up to the flavor of the movie.

So the N word is well used, it's not exaggerated it's very appropriate having in mind the time and place where the actions happens.Yes, slave owners, as well as regular folk would call black people the N word, it was as natural as saying the sky is blue and that slave is a N\u0085 The violence doesn't spoil the picture at all although it is very exaggerated.And there is no reason to find this a racist movie, nor it depicts all white men as \"the villain\".",

            "content": "Now, Tarantino is one of the best directors in my opinion. And Django Unchained is a damn near masterpiece. The, actors and their performance, the camera work, the plot; all nearly immaculate. I enjoy the over the top nature of Tarantino's work, like the gushing blood or the character of Stephen. Furthermore the realistic dialogue, in general how people converse in this movie is a real treat. And the score for the movie is extremely catchy. The only two minor complaints about the movie are a.) in the first half of the movie, Django and Dr. Schultz ride through a city and people turn their heads at the sight of them but that completely disappears after that and any other city scene avoids that scenario entirely, which seems unrealistic and b.) how neatly Django was able to set up the wire for the dynamite. It is placed quite elaborate and I doubt that he had the time to install the wire that way since the remaining people of Candyland were already on the premises and the reunion with broom Hilda was already at dawn so the time table seems to be cut short for a quite professional installation. But other than that the movie is, as I already said, highly enjoyable. Tarantino doesn't rely on basic tropes or telling a story in order to push some narrative about morality or doing the right thing. And although the story is about revenge and doing what's right and also has a few clich\u00e9s, the movie doesn't have that at its core. The movie isn't trying to be about that. It's a movie that simply tells a moving story about people fighting for each other. It's not here to remind people that slavery is a bad thing or that being an evil person is a big no no, it simply tells a story with some realistic and relatable characters that are very much human. And I can respect that heavily.",

Even if it was just for less than half of the movie time, I'd say that Leonardo DiCaprio, as Calvin Candie, has successfully pulled off a \"Tony Montana\" Al Pacino in his intensity. Calvin Candie himself could be made into a whole movie!! Waltz and Foxx have played King Schultz and Django Freeman effortlessly and their chemistry is only too perfect! Samuel Jackson and Kerry Washington were also brilliant. In this movie too, Tarantino revisits his recurring themes such as Revenge and Racism in his usual narcissistic yet brutally stylish fashion.May it be the tension, the stand-offs, the quick silent moments before heavy western style action, the surprises, the aestheticization of gore, the storytelling and visuals, the dialogues, the background music, the acting or the the urge for revenge, Django Unchained excels in every department and is undoubtedly another Tarantino masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino blows you away with this movie, and himself up too, quite literally.",

People say it was to bloody, well how do you think it was back then. A bunch of peaches and cream, no it was not. I especially like the fact that every time there was a gunshot, blood and guts went everywhere. Grown men cried for mercy in real Gunfights there are no Hero's that say uh oh you got me!!! No in real life they cry worse than babies, gunfight is not pretty and should never be depicted as such.

This movie will be remembered the most an inspired superb acting, by the Oscar winner, excellent Christoph Waltz (plays a character Dr. King Schultz) and a superb acting Leonardo DiCaprio (plays a character Calvin Candie). Excellent Christoph Waltz was brilliant in the unusual and complex role a refined bounty hunter and he successfully carried the action of this movie. I think the writer and director Q. Tarantino made \u200b\u200ba serious mistake that he was relieved before the end of the movie the characters which starred C. Walz and L. DiCaprio. The role of J. Foxx was a routine, less complex, that he satisfying acted. Tarantino's usual actor Samuel L.

I think it uses dramatic license and doesn't reflect the real world for slaves. However, it is an attractive film that always makes you want to know what will happen next.The main character is Django, the slave. Another important and interesting character is Dr. King. Dr. King gives Django freedom and wants him to be a bounty hunter. Django's only condition to do this is to rescue his wife who is a slave as well. Django and Dr. King arrest and kill several people and get lots of money for that. Django overcomes difficulties and dangers, and finally he rescues his wife. Dr. King dies while helping him.Another impressive character is Steven, the slave-owner's black butler. He is cunning and treacherous. He even helps whites to punish the slaves. The acting is very vivid, and leads to me wanting to slap him when I saw his face in the movie.I think the selling point of this movie is the vivid plot that shows how the slaves suffer physical and psychological torture.

The story is no Pulp Fiction, but the acting is. Christopher Wirz keeps climbing the Hollywood ladder, slowly solidifying himself in the business and all other Tarantino films. Jamie Foxx was absolutely brilliant as Django, bringing a \"badass\" persona as well as a taste for the excitement. DeCaprio nailed it as well, his acting for an evil plantation owner was quite fitting, and there is one particular scene in the movie that strikes fear in the entire audience. Perhaps the most memorable acting was Samuuel L. Jackson, who plays DeCaprio's loud-mouth loyal servant. He manages to be mostly comical but also acts as an evil schemer. The most underrated part of the movie is most definitely the cameos. I am still confused on why James Remar played two different characters; possible Tarantino's way of fu**ing with the audience? Who knows, but other cameos such as Jonah Hill's was absolutely hilarious, I don't want to ruin it.

            "content": "Review posted originally on InspirationRation.com - Django Unchained is Quentin Tarantino's latest epic, a western (or rather 'Southern') genre action movie revolving around the titular Django, a freed slave played by Jamie Foxx. With the help of a German bounty hunter, Django becomes an experienced bounty hunter himself, with the eventual goal of rescuing his wife from a Mississippi plantation.This is an amazing piece of cinema. Nothing less than expected from Tarantino, who has proved he is a master in this field time and time again. Django Unchained starts off as western as it can be, with old-school type starting credits and the original Django-soundtrack of the 1960's inspiration. Fast zooms and extreme close-ups are used throughout the movie to keep that style of the western present throughout, but Tarantino wouldn't be Tarantino if he didn't inject his own style into the mix.There is some great action here, all brutal and gruesome. Although not as over-the-top as can be seen in some of Tarantino's earlier works, the blood does flow rather freely. The story does not depend on the action however, but rather revolves around the great characters. There is some incredible writing here, with good and proper flawed characters, and amazing actors to portray them. Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, and especially Leonardo DiCaprio depict their respective roles splendidly. They get plenty of time to do so too, with over 2,5 hours the movie is a longer than standard film. It never felt like a long sit or boring to me, but I did feel like the story had somewhat of a problem with pacing at times. The character of Django transforms throughout the story, and this had to be shown with some key moments in time, but I felt like this could have been done cleaner and more efficiently. A minor point of critique in an otherwise great script however.There is a heap of hilarity in the movie as well, which I am sure some misguided people will take as an insult to the serious nature of the slavery issues shown in the movie. Even though there is plenty of laughs to be had, I feel certain none of them could be considered racist, although it is obviously not my prerogative to judge on this. The theme of slavery is a serious one, but if anything the cruel and brutal way in which it is portrayed in this film only underlines this fact, rather than make light of it.Django Unchained is an excellent flick, on a multitude of dimensions. The acting, directing, the action and production value are all stellar. This is certainly a movie to be experienced on the big screen. - Review posted originally on InspirationRation.com",

The usual Tarantinoisms were evident throughout the film - i.e., bold imagery but exaggerated self-indulgent scenes and dialogue, copious blood splattering gore, scene jumping with visible seams, and ridicule that often leans on the side of being trivializing. But of all his films I've seen, this film provided a more appropriate forum for some of his tendencies that are usually inappropriate. For example, this is the one time that his unnecessary and insulting overuse of the N-word had a context for which it made at least some sense, even though it was still featured much more than necessary. It would have given the film more credibility if more research was done for an accurate depiction of facts (e.g. Nefertiti's image paired with the name Cleopatra).The lead characters did a fantastic job shining through Tarantino's overindulgent dialogue. However, Tarantino's signature lack of restraint constantly looms ready to overshadow their wonderful performances at any point. What unfolds is a movie that was much longer than its content justified, and with a few lazy scenes that didn't amount to anything that moved the story along. I appreciated the overall effort. The atrocities of slavery are unapologetically brought to the forefront for a new generation of people of all ethnicities to view, feel the unnerving discomfort of, and discuss with the renewed fervor that a controversial film typically sparks. It's unfortunate that the usual bad taste that Tarantino films leave is reliably left at the end of this one and competes with the phenomenal performances of the actors.

Leonardo DeCaprio plays a villain with glee. It was well acted and believable. It was a fairly good story, I like to watch a film that strays from the average and predictable, especially in westerns. It well filmed, with beautiful scenery. I recognized the Grand Tetons. But the film was way too long and bloody. I spent the last half hour just hoping for it all to end.",

I have noticed that I used to get upset and uncomfortable when seeing white people negatively or comically portrayed in Blaxploitation films. This film does the opposite for good reasons.African Americans have been and continue to be visually misrepresented in the media and film. Django Unchained aggressively demonstrates this toxicity and human trafficking in order to raise awareness.Just think of how many hundreds of thousands of people still enjoy watching thuggish law enforcement on Fox's Cops (still popular since 1989) target minority males and people of color, yet this is legitimate entertainment? I doubt that anyone who has given this film a negative review has ever seen a spaghetti western, such as the original Django (1966) film with Italian superstar Franco Nero.Those who don't know Navajo Joe (1966), Death Rides of Horse (1967) and even They Call Me Trinity (1970), are poorly qualified to judge this cinematic homage to the holy trinity of western exploitation directors: Sergio Leone, Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Sollima.",

Yes there were plenty of light moments but underneath there was a story which QT told fantastic. The stellar cast what was put together, was perfect, but would have been great to have seen Will Smith as Django. Again i think this was Jamie Foxx's best performance since Ray. Along with another great performance from Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz, the sly and eccentric bounty hunter posing as a dentist, Just faultless performance again from him. Samuel L. Jackson as the scene-stealing house slave who is foul-mouthed and scary, while every line of his is comically disturbing. If there is any snobbery that should be directed towards the Oscars, is that there is no nomination for Leonardo DiCaprio for his extraordinary performance as Calvin Candie who is truly terrifying and unlike any role DiCaprio has explored before.

            "content": "Director Quentin Tarrantino is a master storyteller and he carefully lays out yet another imaginative and original historical piece with Django Unchained. He is one of the few modern film makers who clearly works hard at delivering qualitative and unique ideas to mainstream audiences. The film does not disappoint movie goers looking for classic Tarrantino elements either. Django Unchained is filled with well-developed, strong leading characters, awesome musical cues, a few surprising cameos (Don Johnson), lengthy and intense dialogue, gratuitous violence (pushing the point of ridiculous) and of course, an epic grand finale.****SPOILER ALERT**** Although Jamie Foxx falls surprisingly flat as Django - Tarrantino will always deliver at least some interesting casting choices. This time the true stars of the film were supporting actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Waltz. Waltz shined as the unusual and well-mannered German bounty hunter who meets his demise on account of pride, human decency and honor (his Oscar was well-deserved). DiCaprio plays a wealthy plantation owner (Candy Land - where the cinematography is best) who, despite all his privileges has gone slightly mad with an unnerving attraction to brutality and violence. Watch the film just to see their performances, but be warned - Django Unchained plays out too slowly with a run-time well over two and half hours. Tarrantino gets caught up in too much dialogue and unnecessary tangents.Viewers will get their fill of well-choreographed fight scenes in the lengthy run time though, with a hefty body count that includes lots of blood splattering (a director trademark). Tarrantino even keeps the camera steady through it all - disregarding the current craze of intense camera shaking that seems to be so common now in action films. And, despite my ability to appreciate a glorious fight, one critical piece of this story involves one of the most disturbingly violent scenes I've ever seen.The director succeeds in making you uncomfortable during the scenario - an emotion his works play on often. I shook my head slowly while at the theater and said to myself, \"It's not Tarrantino unless I have to close my eyes at least once.\"",

The ketchup blood squirts were reminiscent of any below average, D grade, slasher film of your choice. Even more troubling are the blatantly reinforced stereotypes. In spite of that, I was still hanging onto this ridiculously long melodrama because of the dynamic relationship between Django and the doctor. However, that too was ruined by horrible script writing. I wish I could say I didn't see it coming, but it was incredibly transparent. I am curious though, how can one be so betraying to ones own character within the span of an hour or so? In one breath the doctor is a man of wisdom and restraint; he knows the limits of his work. Yet, towards the end, he throws it all away citing that he just couldn't help himself. What a waste of a good character. All in all, I would not recommend, nor would I sit through this painful flick again.",

A black slave is freed by a mysterious bounty hunter who then help each other fulfill their personal motives. As it is a Tarantino movie, achievement of a motive isn't easy for anyone. Plans are bound to go wrong.Despite the layered performances by Jamie Foxx and the prodigy Christoph Waltz, the show - stealer for me is Leonardo DiCaprio playing his evilest character, the Missisippi plantation owner with an ironic name - 'Calvin Candie'. The iconic dining table scene of him breaking the glass while confronting Django and Dr. Schultz is my clear favourite - that explanation of phrenology, and breaking of wine glass act! There is an air of romance midway and some comic relief too, with the climax being the obvious violent : gunshots everywhere and 'Unchained' by James Brown playing in the background. Not everytime can Samuel L. Jackson be the male lead for a black guy in a Tarantino movie, though he too plays his significant part being his usual audacious.

This movie is a series of freshness and great entertainment. Similar to all Tarantino films this movie is one of his best and it is vaguely unpredictable as it makes up for a neoteric entertainment value and film. A film that makes the audience suck up to the screen and not notice its captivation. This movie was a blast!Django Unchained follows a tale of a black man who is in the cause of slavery and is owned by different plantation owners. On his way with other black men, an unusual white man is encountered and saves Django (Jamie Fox) and becomes a freeman. The man who saved him is a bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and requires Django to help him assassinate three overseers who are wanted dead or alive. Meanwhile, Django offers Dr. Schultz to assist in rescuing his wife who is separated. She is owned by a ruthless yet gentle massive plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo Dicaprio). Now they must ride off to sunset and rescue Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) and conceive freedom from slavery. As this plot is very intriguing as a revenge form for a different take, it may also become risky. As we've come to expect, the most reasons of watching a Tarantino film is regarded to the dialogue. The dialogue is once again, fantastic, entertaining and so riveting to listen and hear people simply speaking to one another. Also, as this film is set in the time period of an active slavery, it avails galore amount of 'N' words. This is a racist expression towards black men but this film properly addresses these harmful and risky words professionally. It is a film that offbeat of modern and mainstream films. It captivates old film styles that are a form of a rarity nowadays. Conjointly, the acting is near perfection. Jamie Fox is consistently good as always, Leonardo Dicaprio is extremely courageous and insane finally, Christoph Waltz is shockingly prodigious and continues to surprise all audiences and the Academy Awards. Likewise, in all Tarantino films, violence is colossal and over the top. It may disturb most of the audiences as they approach but later on laugh and relish the enjoyment of the violence and gore. Overall, Tarantino has reformed another modern film masterpiece and never leave in the lurch from audiences. He has overly improved from periods of time and continues to. This film is a great entertaining revenge tale that will be never achieved in the hands of other filmmakers. It is infinitely glad to have filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, one of the best writer-directors of this decade. Grade: A+",

            "content": "SPOILERSI've had a love-hate relationship with many of Tarantino's bigger films. They are all very entertaining.I have a indirect connection with an actor or two in the film, which made me want to see it even more.The film had been sitting in my Netflix list for a long time. I knew I wanted to see it, but the subject matter and the publicized use of racial slurs made me hesitant. Honestly, that's been my biggest gripe about Tarantino. One of my favorite movies of all time is \"True Romance\". While he was only a writer in the film (not the director), the scene with Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper where racial epithets are used to infuriate the Sicilian (Walker) into doing something (quickly) that he normally wouldn't do has Tarantino's imprint all over it. For me, the scene is great and at the same time so ultra-cringe worthy that I can't bring myself to watch it with other people. I find this sad, because I would like to share the movie with others. The other main use of racial slurs that is a problem for me was \"Pulp Fiction\". It probably has something to do with the character, the actor, and the delivery that make it especially offensive (not in the general sense, but in the personal distaste of something sense). When Tarantino himself says, \"Did you notice a sign in the front of my house that said 'Dead N***** Storage'?\" That line. That delivery was just excessive, out of place, and unrealistic. He used the \"N-word\" multiple times during that conversation, but that line for whatever reason makes the scene unwatchable for me. It may have something to do with my dislike of his acting ability almost as much as the phrase. (I did like him in \"From Dusk till Dawn\", though)I know I'm not the first person to complain about the language in Tarantino films. I know Samuel L. Jackson defends him. I'm really just speaking from a personal viewpoint.As an aside, I wasn't a big fan of the \"Kill Bill\" movies. I'm not even sure why. Maybe they were too film noir-y for me.Why does any of that matter? Well, people may have an opinion of Tarantino and by extension the film based on his previous films. So, let's discuss \"Django Unchained\"...The title of my review is \"Exactly what I expected in some ways and completely unexpected in other ways\". This IS a Tarantino film. It is violent. It is vulgar. It is entertaining. It's well-made, well-scored, well-filmed, well-paced, well-written (mostly). All of these things have Tarantino's influence to a healthy degree. He does hit some sour notes, mostly near the end of the movie.The best part of the movie are the performances by the three main characters (Foxx, Waltz & DiCaprio), as well as a very good performance by Jackson. Tarantino's influence here is probably most seen in Foxx's performance, and least in Waltz and DiCaprio. Much like \"Inglourious Basterds\", Waltz steals the show. Though, DiCaprio once again proves his generational acting chops.Jamie Foxx's performance is very good. There are a couple of hiccups, but nothing that stops him from being believable. Probably the worst scene for him was where he was reading. The cadence and pronunciation did not match with someone who struggled to read. I've been watching him since \"In Living Color\". Watched most of the Jamie Foxx Show episodes. And, seen most of his movies. I would put this performance in his Top 5-7 performances. I think \"Ray\" is probably his consensus #1 performance. I still remember watching \"Dearly Beloved\" - Jamie Foxx (Season 3, Episode 20). In that episode he sang and played the piano. We already knew he was funny. He could act. But, with his musical ability I thought he was going to be something big(ger).The worst part of the movie was the ten minutes (or so) that Tarantino is on the screen. He is terrible. I wish there was someone who could tell him to his face how bad he was for this role. If he wants to be Stan Lee, then sit at a diner with a newspaper for god's sake. Don't have close up and tons of painful-to-watch-and-listen-to dialog. Not in a period piece. (Remember I liked him as a neurotic psychotic brother of George Clooney) Because his scenes were near the end of the film it really put a damper on the overall enjoyment of the movie. If he had been one of the two guys in the first scene of the movie, I would have forgotten about how bad he was by the end.The second biggest flaw in the movie is the \"Handshake\". Candy won't let Django and Schultz leave until Schultz shakes his hand. It seems to be meant as a play or a way for Candy (DiCaprio) to exert his dominance, however as it drags on, it doesn't work as intended and ends up looking like a simple excuse (for Tarantino) to start the bloodbath that ensues. I don't have a problem with the bloodbath. I just think what lead to it was unrealistic and unbelievable. It didn't make sense.I think Tarantino is great. I also think he's starting to become a caricature of himself. I wish he had a contemporary who could look at him and tell him something sucks, or at least that it simply doesn't work (the way he thinks it does/should).One nitpicky issue with the film was the fake and voluminous blood splatter from gun shot wounds. They were immediately noticeable and excessive. Towards the end during the final bloodbath they became almost comical. That could work, if that was the effect that Tarantino was going for (in a sort of Spinal Tap sort of way) and it worked within the film. I don't think comical blood splatters accentuated the gun fight. I think it detracted from it.Eliminating his cameo and re-writing the \"Handshake\" scene to make more sense would have made this movie epic.Currently, the IMDB.com rating is 8.4. I think that's a little high, due to the glaring flaws. I would give it 7.6 stars, but there isn't a partial star option.Oddly enough my hesitation over the use of racial slurs didn't really come into play in the movie. Were they used? Obviously, yes... extensively. But, for the most part, they didn't stand out as being unbelievable or excessively offensive / cringe-worthy, outside of the obvious offensive nature of the word. I'm speaking more to its use and delivery as being believable as compared to extraneous and excessive / pointless.",

But whether one liked that film or not, it does not matter, as the most important thing was that Tarantino found Christoph Waltz. Mr Waltz succeeds extraordinarily in Django Unchained too, and some would say he steals most of the scenes he is in. In addition to fine performance by this fine actor, we are served to solid performances by Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio too. Jamie's role is on parts a bit laid back and \"cool\" but we can sense his focus in his eyes. Leo obviously enjoys working with Tarantino and like many actors, really overplays (in a good way) when he gets into the role and spits out the well written dialog from QT. Directing is as good Tarantino as we've ever had, I'd probably most compare this to Kill Bill vol 2. There is blood but it is cartoonish and actually the most violent parts of the movie are couple of scenes portraying more emotional violence. Tarantino obviously pays great homepage to spaghetti westerns of yesterday and we are even treated to a score by Ennio Morricone. I wouldn't mind a sequel of sorts. Bloody well done!",

            "content": "WITH five Golden Globe nominations and two wins (supporting actor and screenplay), Quentin Tarantino's latest offering really packs a punch. Set in 1858, Django Unchained tells the story of a former dentist turned bounty hunter, Dr King Schultz (Golden Globe winner Christoph Waltz), helping newly freed slave Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx) to save his slave wife from one of the biggest plantation owners in the deep south of America. With the exception of 3:10 to Yuma (2007), I would rather watch paint dry than watch a Western, but Django Unchained is just plain exciting from start to finish. When I'm dragged to the movies to watch the latest Jennifer Aniston rom-com, I would expect to be bored senseless, but when it comes to Tarantino, audiences will want florid language, good storytelling, outstanding acting and a whole bunch of gore, and my oh my, does it deliver. The film has all the normal Tarantino personality, with long one-to-one scenes and well crafted dialogue, interesting characters and bad-ass monologues. Each actor plays his role to perfection \u2014 Foxx as the newly freed slave, Waltz as the quirky yet malicious bounty hunter, the beautiful Kerry Washington as the lost lover, Leonardo DiCaprio as a powerful young plantation owner, and Samuel L. Jackson as the trusty house slave. The film is a departure from Tarantino's usual form of disjointed storytelling \u2014 most notably Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction \u2014 and smooth flowing with a clear beginning, middle and ending. The last 20 minutes of the film tended to drag, but that's just Tarantino. Fans will appreciate the typical Tarantino shlock, but for newer audiences, it also a story that everybody can appreciate. It is a serious movie with a good take on slavery in the 1800s and some heart-wrenching scenes, but Tarantino also offers a lot of comic relief, both in the witty dialogue and situational comedy. Django Unchained is not up to the standard of his 1990s best, but if you want a solid narrative with good action, this one is for you.",

There's a nice turn from Di Caprio playing the nasty plantation owner Calvin Candy, and Jamie Foxx is great as Django. The film of course being a Tarantino film it is full of violence and not just in the sense of blood; this is also where the dark undertones of the film comes into play (which is quite well covered over by soundtracks and clever cinematography) the sense of violence towards the slaves and especially the whipping scene of Kerry Washington.

Yes, the amount of blood was over the top and the way Tarantino went to show the viewers his love of violence was a bit much at times.Yet, this film is in my opinion Tarantino's best so far.

This film is an instant classic, the best work so far from an extremely talented and innovative director, sports a cast of fantastic actors in great roles, contains multifaceted messages, and has some of the greatest gags I've ever seen, and it's also a great Western!",

And Kerry Washington was so beautiful! The film is definitely a tribute to race and honor, as well as a worthy carrier of the Tarantino seal. Violence plays a role of emphasizing the stress of the situation, while is not the focus of attention nor the center of the plot.

If I don't get a better rating than Django Unchained, I will return your dollar. Here's what caused me to enjoy your movie the least of all your work...1: Pacing. It was WAY too long. I found myself nodding off a couple of times. There was FAR to much dialogue, so much so that when an action scene FINALLY arrived, I was too bored and too tired to even care.2: Sound editing. Does EVERY door need to creak when it is opened? If so, does it have to be the same sound effect for every door? If so, does it have to be the same damn \"creaking-door\" sound effect that we've been hearing on every single episode of The Simpsons for the past 23 years? 3: Gore. For a movie that was pretty much 3 hours long, there was not enough gore and violence to keep me interested, and when there was gore and violence, it seemed very unrealistic. I might even go so far to suggest that some of it was CGI, which I hate. The blood looked transparent and unrealistic, unlike in your previous works. I have a fantastic recipe for very realistic looking (and edible) fake blood, which looks better than most of the blood in this movie.4: Characters. I was not sure who the main protagonist was until near enough the third act. I just did not know who to care about, so I didn't care about anyone.One dollar.",

            "content": "First and foremost I am not going to sit here and talk about the film on any sort of in depth basis as I do not study film and have no grounds to base these opinions upon. I am, however, and always have been a avid movie goer and since my first Tarantino film I knew I absolutely loved his style and presentation. Personally, I thought Django Unchained was phenomenal. I think Tarantino did what he does best in this movie and that is entertain. The film provided a lot of everything, comedy, humor, action, violence, and romance. Personally I don't really know how you could dislike it with it covering all of those categories. Now, as to the criticism from people like Spike Lee and other members of the Black community, I simply am confused. History is an area I have grounds to speak on so I will. First of all, yes Spike Lee this is a movie that involves slavery and yes movies are meant for entertainment. Are people going to see the movie and being entertained by the simple IDEA of slavery? No. Does the movie happen to have slavery in it and also be entertaining? Yes. Correlation does not cause or imply causation Mr. Lee. Also to everyone else complaining about the use and depiction of slavery in the movie, don't watch it. You knew what you'd be in for, it's Tarantino for god's sake he isn't the most family friendly director. Also at the very least it is accurate to the time it is portraying which if anything, brings light to those who did not truly understand the brutality of slavery. And finally, I think some people have the facts wrong. Slavery, whilst being attributed and credited to America was not its birthplace. Slavery existed far before America was populated with white folk. And black people were not the only people enslaved, the only reason I believe that slavery is so closely tied to black people is because of the time it took place. When whites were slaves it was far further back in the past before Europe and such were developed. Africa was behind and considered a \"developing nation\". Also, white men were no t the first to enslave black people. Other black people were. During tribal wars in Africa the losing survivors were captured and kept as slaves. When the British came to Africa looking for workers, the slaves were the first thing the tribal leaders handed over and it escalated from there. Finally to some of the speculation over the \"KKK\" scene and its comedic values the KKK did no exist until AFTER the civil war as a way of \"keeping free black folk in line\". The people depicted in the film were called \"regulators\" and their primary purpose was to find and return run away slaves. That's the history lesson for today folks!",

You could easily skip the middle hour and not miss out a thing on the story. Some of the scenes did drag and were unnecessary. The first 45 mins was brilliant and then it just dragged after that.

            "review_title": "\"Tarantino's funniest film so far, yet also his most violent...\"",
            "content": "Since his first interview as a director, Quentin Tarantino has made it no secret that he loves spaghetti westerns and will undoubtedly be making one at some point. Sure, all of his films have included a Mexican standoff, but it wasn't until this year, when he released Django Unchained, that his no holds barred western was let loose on the world. The film follows Django (Jamie Foxx) as he is freed by Dr King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and their mission to find Django's wife Brunhilda (Kerry Washington) from the slave owning tyrant Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio in his first ever role as a villain).The film wastes no time in getting stuck into hilariously witty dialogue, nor does it hesitate when it comes to bloodthirsty violence in it's opening scene. It's as if Tarantino has written Django knowing we've all seen his films before, we know what we're here to see. And it works. At almost three hours, it needed no longer in the first act to establish anything, and it fits with the revenge theme that we, as an audience, want to get on with it as much as Django does. As the story develops, we are rewarded with beautiful cinematography, montages with some of Tarantino's best uses of a soundtrack to date (including original tracks from Rick Ross and John Legend), and even some surprising guest appearances.There is no doubt that this is Tarantino's funniest film so far, yet also his most violent. Tarantino has suggested two types of violence are portrayed: the \"cathartic\"1 killing Django does on his mother of all revenge missions, which, although extremely visual and gory, is often enjoyable and amusing to watch (a sign we are successfully tapping in to Django's psyche) and in the red corner, the \"Auschwitzian\"1 (sic) violence conducted and condoned by Calvin Candie. This, I imagine, has been the source of the negativity towards the film. However, it has been suggested by all involved, this is not Tarantino's violence; what we see here really happened. I'm afraid, unfortunately, after such iconic violence as Nazi-scalping and Police having their ears removed, it seems like a case of the boy who cried wolf; that no one will now believe him when he is finally telling the truth.The problem with Django is that it is so closely linked to Inglourious and not in the Tarantino- universe way that his films are usually linked. Our hero represents a victimised ethnic group wanting payback, but as the \"1 in 10,000 n*****s\" that has the guts to stand up against the tyrannous evil (and remember, Colonel Landa in Inglourious was originally written with DiCaprio in mind). So with help from Ennio Morricone, a spaghetti western-style mission of retribution is undertaken, with Django even pinching the essence of the so-cleverly written language changing in Inglourious' opening scene.As a stand alone film (and this is the basis on which I have awarded the film's star rating) Django Unchained is excellent, Tarantino on top form as both a writer and director, but as an addition to Tarantino's all important body of work, a notion that he holds so close, it is slightly disappointing to see the usual bearer of such extraordinarily original work deliver a somewhat disguised and re-worked item from his back catalogue.1 Both quotations taken from Tarantino's Channel 4 interview (10/01/2013) Full interview can be viewed here: http://www.channel4.com/news/tarantino-uncut-when-quentin-met- krishnan-transcript",

At least that picture had some narrative drive, and a heroine you could root for, and terrific choreography to recommend it. Even the bad guys in Kill Bill were entertaining.

I became fan of Quentin Tarantino after kill bill and he has still not disappointed me or any other of his fans. His approach with reality with a twist of slight fiction is enjoyable at every part.

Rather than proving to manifest perils and atrocious reflections of a liberated slave the movie delves into an entertaining spectacle.\nThe movies cult status was affirmed by performances of Di Caprio and Christopher Waltz. Waltz performance as Dr Schultz of German origin never betrayed the German pedigree thoroughly deserved his Oscar. Di Caprio has proven why he is the best in business by portraying Calvin a barbaric, tyrannical and imperious master. The presence of Jamie Foxx draws parallel with Clint Eastwood from the Dollars Trilogy where his guns do the talk. \nWhat distinguishes this movie is it its cinematography backed up with stellar action sequences. The opening scene builds an intriguing conversation be Waltz pulling the trigger. The pub scene highlights Tarantino, s skill to keep audience on the hook by compelling storytelling.The movie is inundated with quintessential western shootouts. It has got everything guns, men, blood and the heroism. The torture scenes rather than being gruesome have had conversations which keeps the movie exciting rather than disturbing.

It is a must watch for every western lover, a Tarantino zealot and every film lover. This film might not serve appetite of every movie enthusiast but has certainly been a regalement for me. This will go as one of the finest films in the 21st century and has shattered fetters of a Genre which was the heartthrob of the 60, s. This might not be Tarantino, s magnus opus but a sensation of a western Genre.",

Once you look under the surface--under all the rather dramatic blood splatters and drawn out monologues--you'll see that this movie greatly depicts what the issue of \"color\", over time, has evolved into. Even now, we still see the \"Djangos\", the \"Dr. Schultzs\", the \"Broomhildas\" and even the \"Stephens\" walking right outside our doorsteps. Quentin's motion pictures have always striked me as nothing less than amazingly intriguing, but the symbolism in this one has really touched a part of me that I didn't even know was there. Tarantino has done it again. A bold and brilliant film that breaks rules and really \"tells it like it is\".",

            "content": "Not everyone likes Tarantino films, they can sometimes be a little off putting with the way they jump around in time. For my sins I really enjoyed Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, really hated Kill Bill for some reason (which didn't need to be two films), adored Inglorious Basterds and I'm quite indifferent about a lot of the other films he has made. Django Unchained was a film I really enjoyed. There are a few things in this film that make me think its a love it or hate it \"Marmite\" movie, some factors you will enjoy, some you will hate and again as with above, some you will be indifferent about.Yes this film does have a fair bit of blood and violence within it, not quite constantly from start to finish, but at a number of points within. However, in the time period it (this film) is set people don't just kindly ask others to stop what they are doing. If they shoot you then they shoot you, that is how it was back them. Such is the issue with the liberal use of the word n****r, some people find that it might genuinely bother them. If it does then this is not the film for you. I'm not saying that if you like this film you must enjoy the use of the word, just that (again when this film was set) its historically accurate to witness that word to be used as much as it is within the film.The soundtrack is interesting to say the least, and at small occasions perhaps not fitting of the historical period, but it worked for me anyway. As for other things with the film, it all added up for me to be a very enjoyable film. The comedy within it is brilliant, and the characters (to me at least) have depth and things don't always happen the way you might expect them to. I think the cast were well chosen and suited their roles, and I must say that this has to be one of my favourite DiCaprio films, perhaps even rivalling my favourite (Blood Diamond). As for Samuel L Jackson in this, his character and acting is sheer brilliance. I won't spoil it for you, though I assure you its good.If you are a big fan of the style of films that Tarantino makes then I thoroughly recommend you go see this film. It's not a time warp special as with some of his previous films and does indeed follow a fairly decent and linear narrative. I found it to be a believable story, maybe not some of the ways people go about things, but overall whilst the film is near 3hrs long, I never once felt like it dragged. Once again, I really loved this but I'm conscious that as with many Tarantino films it could be a very much love it or hate it. If you are the kind of person who walks out of films in disgust if you don't like them, then don't go just in case you don't like this one. Even if I have hated a film, I've already spent my money so I will sit through something regardless, otherwise it's a waste of money. However, I think that if you visit www.IMDb.com and enjoy the description about the film, you will love it.",

            "content": "I'd like to start off with pleading to anyone who has the intent on watching this film, or any Tarantino film to hold that thought and first think about watching Sergio Leone's 'Money Trilogy'. Seriously, think about it, \"I am going to watch Leone's 'Money Trilogy'\". Rather, A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad, The Ugly; since it isn't actually a trilogy.Now, this may seem like a horrifically low budget advertisement for a set of films that were created well before my birth. Take note though, that this 'trilogy' was also created well before Tarantino started making films, and I argue that everything Tarantino seems to be acclaimed for is none other than a petty rip off of Leone's glorious masterpiece. (Of which were one was a remake of an even older Japanese film\u0085) Certainly without a doubt, Django Unchained is a reproduction of the 'spaghetti western' style. In fact it is so much of Leone's style, that it goes as far as to replicate almost everything those films had, except Tarantino sucks, so he turns this bad-ass style into an overdone piece of Hollywood crap that, if it were a motorcycle, would no doubt begin falling apart when travelling at high-speed.The central plot targets a bounty hunter, until half way through when it in fact targets slave's efforts at reuniting with his wife. I thought that was in poor taste, as 1) the ending was crap, 2) westerns are better off focusing on things like gold, money, or bandit's corpses, not love and riding off towards the sunset. The film also incorporates music that is so much like Ennio Morricone's compositions, except that they weren't. The tunes would have three or four notes excerpts of a piece from Money Trilogy, and swerve into another direction of much lesser quality. \"Well of course, that's just what Tarantino wanted!\" Yet that's just the problem, it has been done before, the music, the characters, the plot (except the love story) the action, it's all been done. Tarantino just rips off Leone. Even the way he shoots, close ups, pan outs; really though I am not familiar with the terminology, I feel confident saying that Tarantino is no good.Aside from Tarantino's distasteful wielding of the spaghetti western, the acting in Django Unchained is, for the most part, quite good. Christopher Waltz is particularly good, his calm demeanour and professionalism is appreciated. Jamie Foxx is mediocre, certainly nothing widely credible. I found the scene where Foxx's character attempts to read rather ridiculous, as I find it hard to believe that any American Slave would have even been able to understand the phonetics of English, let alone read a letter, or whatever it was; albeit rather poorly. DiCaprio was also notably good. Samuel L. Jackson was clever and funny, although generally the same character he was in every other movie\u0085 perhaps just more suitable in this position.Thus before you watch another Tarantino movie and go on rambling about how bad-ass he is, watch Leone's stuff. A Fistful of Dollar, For a Few Dollars More, The Good, The Bad, The Ugly and A Fistful of Dynamite a.k.a. Duck You Sucker! They are the real classics that can't nor shouldn't be replicated in such poor taste. Tarantino continues to direct in a manner which I find corny in the sense that it is overdone and poorly imagined. Django Unchained is his statement of that.",

            "content": "This, unbelievable, is the first film director Quentin Tarantino westerns. Despite the great influence that gender has exercised in his other films, this is where it is most clearly intended to make a Western. The concept of gender is a somewhat complex to understand point and as artistic styles, is divided into historical periods.First, they have a beginning, in which gender is defining and shaping a set of rules to follow. Then there is the fullness, where the most own style movies and then a \"pseudo\" genre, also called mannerism or late style, where the rules preset in the first period are breaking to create new forms and becoming in other creations.Django, is mainly westerns, tells a dramatic story, which is intrinsic to western. There are certain traits that are evident in Django as conversations, showing its position as the hero of the film, as a hard man, are mercilessly with his enemies, with hardly feeling safe only when they talk about Broomhilda, which is its weakness and he does not care to do anything just to get to be with her.The plane of the meeting, after being all the killing in Candyland mansion is a clear example. In this picture looks like the shadow of Django, after opening the door, it is projected onto the wall. Remember to certain planes of films like The Searchers and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, both of John Ford. In them, the hero, appears inside a door and light, behind him, makes trimmed in chiaroscuro. It is a plan that lasts barely a second, but that has much explanatory power of the film.It is also curious, remember that the story that Dr. Schultz Django on Broomhilda, the princess who is locked, guarded by a dragon and waiting for the prince, is the same way Django finds (eliminating all mythological factors , obviously). And the western genre is that, a story with a happy ending, in which a hero must overcome many trials to achieve its goal, which at first appears to be impossible, and it is finally achieved. The other genre that I consider key in the movie is the comedy. It's a genre that has not been mixed with the western, as the stories they tell are dramas. And, from the beginning, the comedy is present, which manages to do that we do not take the story seriously. The presentation by Dr. Schultz, a man who appears to be a dentist, takes on his car a dock with a tooth. This is the first sign of absurd humor, but there is more of the same style as when Django is free to wear a suit and saturated blue color becomes unfit for the time and causes automatically laughter in the audience.But there is more. two comic moments of almost identical repetition are also produced: one when they kill the Marshall Gill Tatum, the town, and both come out with their hands up, and the other after killing the Brittle twins, which again act the the same way. In these two moments, mainly shown as Dr. Schultz has always controlled the situation, and Django is his apprentice.There are also other moments of constant verbal humor as it occurs in the form of talk that has Django and other black characters. The discussion on the word \"sharp\". Word that Django did not know and with whom a funny pun is created.But the funniest film of all, time is one that makes parody of the Ku Klux Klan, an organization of US extreme right on that date did not exist, but would be created several years later. Here Tarantino, parody how it could have been created that organization, and openly laughs at his clothing. These comic moments are mixed with memories of Django to produce the film in the dramatic situation that is happening the protagonist, and get us to stop laughing from the previous situation. good memories, others worse, in those who torture them are mixed.In the action scenes more typical of western, completely loses realism introduces tens of liters of blood, million bullets, gunpowder and explosions. To this must be added the sudden camera movements that we have used the director. Rarely seen in western zooms; and here not only abused, but also uses slow motions, turns 180 \u00b0, overhead shots, rap music, classical ... in short, knows he can do whatever he wants with his films, and it's what he does. And it goes well.All this comedy with scenes of bizarre action, makes seeing the film for the first time, we get out a little of the history and context, as it talks about slavery in America nineteenth century, but we mix with constant jokes and modern music, which encourages us to dance that has put us melancholy. Moreover, at the end dance, albeit on a horse. But I must admit that scene, it seems a little ridiculous, and I think it is another proof that the film takes you out of the historical context.Tarantino, who lives in the XXI century, known as is our pace of life, accelerated, without breaks and with little time to get to talking to people. And he, in his movies give us what we want: frenetic rhythms, many lights, and very long and witty conversations, which contradict somewhat the frantic pace. Some consider tedious and long, but others we were gawking every time we hear them.In short, it is a western film, but not the western of 50-60 years we were used to, but the nineteenth century. It has evolved and adapted to the world in which we live. We can not make a film that shows us exactly its historical context, but as a great movie entertainment that breaks many schemes we preset what is the western genre.",

Never before have i ever respected Jamie Foxx as an actor, singer, or whatever, but now i have a totally new and fresh outlook on him. Not once did i see the TV personality/comedy \"Jamie Foxx\". He took the part of Django and turned him into an eager to learn, big hearted, clever and quick thinking slave that had me rooting for him from the beginning to the end. DiCaprio, whom i've never seen him before play the antagonist, just blew my mind. By the time they were having dinner at Candieland, i was so frightened and yet drawn to the character of Mr. Candie that I was having a hard time not imagining what would it really have been like to be \"owned\" by someone like that if i had been born a century ago? Not to mention the star power of Sam Jackson, and Kerry Washington. Their presence while it was only and mostly towards the end, had an overbearing impact on this film.

            "content": "\"Django\" has all of the Tarantino ingredients in it, yet it fails to be as appealing and creative as some of his previous films. Most notably, in comparison to the 2009 \"Inglourious Basterds\", this film lacks the enthusiasm and originality in the storyline and in the depiction of the characters. Also, and this is a surprise, the dialogue is in many points inferior to any other Tarantino movie so far (even from \"Jacky Brown\"). The music score is excellent once again, although a bit puzzling at times, it seems to be cut off from what is depicted on screen and does not blend harmoniously with the mise en scene like the music score in \"Kill Bill\" did.The second half of the movie is greatly superior from the first, although there is a key difference here. Di Caprio's character gets the better part of the dialogue and the rest of the surrounding characters get more cartoonish in comparison, leading to a \"Wild Bunch\" - like type of slaughter in the Big House that is in all aspects one of the worst choices in the directors career. And why is that? Well, while in Kill Bill V.1, the sword slaughter was perfectly combined and a natural outcome from the rest of the movie (the Bride is depicted as a perfect human cartoon character), in \"Django\" the main character is more of a man than a cartoon. The \"flesh\" that we keep hearing about in the entire film is finally depicted in front of the camera in a brutal manner, but we simply don't care as much as we should. We are not that involved in the story.In conclusion, \"Django\" is closer in style and manner to \"Death Proof\" than \"Inglourious Basterds\" and that is not a good thing. And not because the former is a bad movie (actually \"Death Proof\" was and was supposed to be, much funnier then \"Django\"), no. It is the fact that in order to achieve a perfect combination of history, fun, politics and drama, Tarantino lost his balance in the script. It simply cannot be the case that in a Tarantino film the only piece of great and firing dialogue is delivered late, in the second part of the film (almost 120 minutes in to the movie) - the scene where Di Caprio has a skull in front of him and shares his theories with us.Strong points: Waltz, Di Caprio, Fritz the horse, music score, second halfAverage points: Foxx, first half, female characters Poor points: Dialogue(!), final slaughter scene, Samuel Jackson Overall: 6/10",

With his amazing movie \"Django Unchained\" Tarantino takes the first step into a new movie movement called \"Post-Existentialism\". The Main Protagonist of the movie Django looks like a beast locked in the middle of 4 walls. He tries to free himself to watch the light.The Real Face of Dr. King SchultzDr. King Schultz is one of the most interesting and eccentric characters of the movie. You always find hidden or visible symbols in Tarantino's movies. There is a scene where Dr. King Schultz and Django tell stories to each other and you can catch a 2 second moment Schultz wearing red trousers on him. According to this, you may think that Tarantino wants you to compare Dr. King Schultz to Mephistopheles, who is always \"sitting on his friend's arm\".Strange Addiction of Calvin CandieCalvin Candie is The Main Antagonist of the movie. In his strictly aristocratic look, you can feel hidden weakness and confusion. He is interested in Phrenology. Tarantino shows us the real mad man who doesn't only want others to believe his imaginary craziness (like Hamlet is talking with the skull) - he is really out of his mind, he is mad.Hidden aim of StephenStephen is The Second Antagonist of the movie. You may think that he is loyal to Calvin but he has full impact on him. During the whole movie, we believe that he can't properly walk and also he is emotionally unbalanced. But it turns out that the skull rotating in Calvin's fingers is Calvin himself.Plato's Allegory of the CaveSchultz telling Django the epic tale of Brunhilde and Siegfried, and how Siegfried earns his happy ending by rescuing Brunhilde. Shadows on the wall reflecting themselves in Django's desperate eyes. Here we can see Postmodernism and Plato's Allegory of the Cave where the freedom starving eyes searching for a happy ending through the burning wall.Importance of the BibleDjango approaches \"Big John\" Brittle and we see that John has some Bible pages sewed into his shirt and is reciting Bible verses. Django shoots him and his blood pour out of his wound which is right in the middle of one of the bible pages.Cameo AppearanceTarantino is well-known for making cameos in his own films. A Kind of \"Suicidal Appearance\" from his side looks like \"The Death of the Author\". He disappears himself from Django's life.

The genre at first glance is simple, like a gingerbread, pour everything with ketchup and jam with actors, however, only Tarantino and one more person today can shoot spaghetti westerns and trash separately without confusing these concepts. For all the comicality, bloodiness and conventionality, Quentin draws realistic slavery, realistic people, realistic love within one canvas and generally digs traditionally deeper than you expect.With the hero of the day, Tarantino has fooled everyone. Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio are as good as you can expect from them in the current situation and even more. But the script is written primarily under Christoph Waltz and with his participation in a painstaking process; he is the king here, he is the central character, this is his benefit performance. His talent once again creates such things that the film wants to be reviewed in any case.

            "content": "It's a good movie, simple as that, and it definitely ranks up there with Tarantino's best works, and there is not much point in delving too deep into the plot, since it's both predictable and conventional in any aspect imaginable. And that's one of my biggest complaints with this movie. Sure, if you watch a Tarantino flick, you don't exactly expect a brilliant story per se, but rather want to see how it is told with over the top scenes and larger than life characters, and in this regard, the movie delivers. He gave the usual buddy-theme and \"damsel in distress\"-theme an interesting twist with the whole slavery and bounty-hunting affair, but overall, it's nothing you haven't seen before. While Christoph Waltz does an outstanding job in portraying the German dentist-turned-bountyhunter Dr. King Schulz as a likable, prosaic and delightfully uninvolved anti-hero - after all, his job is killing people -, you can't help but feel he essentially just reprises his role from Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\", only as a \"good guy\" this time. There is nothing wrong with that, as it worked favourably both for Waltz and the movie itself, but innovative, this is not. DiCaprio, as well, is just deliciously unlikable as the movie's antagonist, and he's about the only refreshing part in it, as you rarely see him performing bad guys. Alas, I was a little disappointed in the role of Django. Not Foxx's performance, but the whole character seems shallow and you can't help but feel it could have been played equally well by any African-American actor. Not saying Foxx didn't give Django his own defining touches, but he just didn't have much to work with. In conclusion, the movie is a 9 out of 10. I substract one point for the usual Tarantinoism when it comes to violence. I know that it is his trademark, and I'm fine with the way he just completely overuses blood and gore during fire-fights, because there, it at least serves a purpose of enhancing the brutality of it, even though I don't like it. What I truly detest is when it's just there for shocks and shows, as it doesn't serve any other purpose other than being offensive (I'm referring to the eye-gouging scene during the Mandingo-fight) and disgusting, and for that, I have very little understanding. This and the reason that Tarantino himself hat a small cameo that was acted out plain HORRIBLE - seriously, if you can't do a southern accent, don't try to fake it - cost this movie a whole point, leaving it at a still good 8/10.",

            "content": "I should have known that when I had seen the trailer I had seen the whole movie. But sometimes I tend to go against my own good judgment. And so I found myself watching a three hour trailer. The first half of the movie you see the unlikely couple of an eloquent German dentist turned bounty hunter and his liberated ex-slave partner killing plenty of supposedly bad guys. You have got to admire how they tracked all these people but you don't get any clue on how they did it. Were these crooks a bit careless on their facebook profiles? Did they track their cell phones? Oh wait, yes 1850. Facebook wasn't so popular than, so it must have been their cellphones.So there you are, Django looking cool and docter Schultz looking clever shooting a whole bunch of guys until they decide to finally liberate Django's wife. She has already been appearing in Django's visions, strolling through fields looking absolutely lovely and endearing, whenever he had a few seconds to spare between piling up the corpses of all those bad guys of course. He's a romantic at heart. When the wife finally does show up for real, you better understand these visions since in real life she apparently also is best at loving smiles and terrified looks. So after almost two hours of scenes that were not going anywhere, or better that were preludes to another geyser of blood, I was sort of getting numb and hoped to get rid of that numbness with the appearance of DiCaprio and Samuel L Jackson. I guess they did their best and for some moment I had the idea there was some plot in this 3 hour splasher. But apparently Tarantino got bored with that, gave Samuel L Jackson some psychic capabilities to expose our two heroes and treat the audience to another 30 minutes of sadistic shootouts. How on earth does this movie get so high on IMDb?",

The only minus of the film is the minimal gun fighting climax which is stylishly built-up and much anticipated till then an the unjustifiable last quarter which only provides us with another interesting cameo from Parks and Quentin. A movie maybe poor in the making but rich in everything else, with both genuine respect for the craftsmanship of directing and audacious indifference to the new-gen directing methods craze...And what about the beautiful, yet again, track-listing of the O.S.T.?Both classical (richie havens, james brown, rocky roberts)and hipster at the same time incorporating true African-American modern music at a classic genre that sounded always either orchestral, or with folk/gospel songs!!",

            "content": "I viewed a trailer for Django around 3 months ago with vague interest and made a mental note to check it out, knowing that it would either sink or soar. It's tough to imagine Tarantino writing a better piece of fan fiction than that of his previous film, Inglorious Basterds, but he has now eclipsed that film along with Pulp Fiction with his newest work, Django: Unchained. Django is the ultimate story of retribution with an (anti)hero and motive the audience can all get behind. Jamie Foxx owns the role of a lifetime as the slave given freedom and the opportunity to exact his pain on the plantation owners ruling the south. Things get more complicated as the story progresses, but never so much that the audience becomes lost. That's not to say that Foxx steals the show, every actor is in full force for the entire film, and at no point is there a weak line thrown in. Django is an incredibly violent film, but this is to the film's credit as it exemplifies the horror of the slavery era and the terrible things those people had to go through. You will probably hate the villains just as much as Django by the film's midway point. But to no surprise, the most intense portions of the film are the long, drawn-out conversations conducted by Christopher Waltz's character (don't be surprised if he gains another Oscar this year, he's earned it). There is no other film I have seen in recent memory that deserves a ten star rating as much as this one. You don't have to love westerns to get into Django, you just have to love good films.

Killing people with weapons is not neat and tidy as is portrayed in many films, I have to respect his choice to be graphic.Mr. Tarantino's mix of music and mythology crosses from the past to present time with clever foreshadowing.The 165 minute running time went by much faster than it seemed, but there were a couple parts that were a bit overworked. My suggestion is to not be afraid to laugh at the wrong places, much like one tends to do in Pulp Fiction after you become familiar with the film's perspective.Foxx, Jackson, DiCaprio, and Waltz are amazing. Ms. Washington is not only very convincing in her role, she is beautiful. The costuming was superb.Mr. Tarantino is not guided by anything other than storytelling in his own way, and this film shows another side of his creativity that will continue to raise the bar for the skills of a director.

It keeps you focused from beginning to end, no moments of bore. Action, humor, tension, great actors. Blood and violence are not missing either, it's not a film to watch with kids but hey.. after all this is a Tarantino film! I've never been a big Tarantino fan, although I generally think his films are good and original. If you're like me and you didn't particularly like his previous films, you should definitely give it a try with Django Unchained! It's a big chance that you will also enjoy this film. There are some clich\u00e9's in this film, but somehow they manage to make the film playful and fun to watch. Christopher Waltz is absolutely brilliant as Dr. Schulz. If Django Unchained is the crown, then Waltz is the pearl of the crown. I loved him in Inglorious Bastards and I've become a big fan after Django Unchained. The film is about Django, the black slave played by Jamie Foxx, and Waltz won the Oscar for the best //supporting// role, but the truth is that he clearly dominates the screen throughout the film. His character is just so lovable and an interesting mix: a witty, great talker with subtle/sarcastic humor and at the same a human and delicate soul, a man of principles. After seeing this film, I guarantee that you will leave the cinema with Dr.Schultz/Christopher Waltz in your mind. The former dentist, now bounty hunter Dr. Schulz is buying (a gun and shooting are involved in the transaction) the slave Django to help him find two wanted criminals. As they travel together finding & killing wanted criminals they end up as partners and Dr. Schulz makes Django a free man. Together they try to reach and free Django's wife who is the slave of a cruel slaves owner played by Leonardo di Caprio. Di Caprio appears here in his best role so far (my opinion), his interpretation of a negative character is very convincing. Jamie Foxx is good, but his character is lacking depth, not allowing him to show versatile acting skills. Samuel L. Jackson appears here in a surprising role and he is good, as usual.The life of the slaves is mostly pictured as brutal & cruel, probably close to how it actually was in those times. There are several violent scenes in this film - two of them I found hard to watch: the bloody Mandinga fight and a slave being killed by dogs. There are also hilarious scenes. For example when the members of the Ku Klux Klan are trying to organize a night attack, but have trouble with the eye holes in their garments which is making the \"fashion\" designer of the group to feel offended and leave the scene. The final part of the film is unexpected. There is a twist point - things which seemed almost settled suddenly get out of control, when Waltz's character is unable to act against his principles. I strongly recommend you to watch this film!",

This film brings him to two new places: (a) he has written a screenplay rivaling Casablanca in terms of unwasted syllables, and (b) he has found his muse, his Diane Keaton if you will, and that is Christoph Waltz. The film is certainly the best film I've seen this year, and as to its subjective ranking in the Tarantino filmography, well, I'd just be splitting hairs, but I'll put it up there as #1. The direction is sublime, the casting superb and inspired, the cinematography unmatched by anything I've seen recently (including Les Miserables), and although bound to be controversial in some circles, the story line spellbinding. No way that I could capture all the dialog; I will need to see this film over and over again, as I have done with the others, in order to fully capture its nuances. Suffice it to say that Waltz is even better than he was in Basterds, Foxx plays his role to perfection, and the supporting players, notably Don Johnson and Sam Jackson, are about as good as it gets (I will confess that it took me some time to realize that I was watching either.) Violent? Yes. Bloody? Very, but as my daughter is quick to point out, it's a paint-ball kind of bloody, so over the top that it goes well beyond gory-frightening into Toonville, and I mean that in the best way possible. There is so much to this movie, and so much deeper than one would think going in. Run, not walk, run to see it. Man, do I adore Christoph Waltz !",

He had some flashbacks about a slave being killed by dogs earlier in the movie (which was an order Calvin gave to his men), but that hardly justifies the shooting. What's worse - after he shoots Calvin instead of killing the guard as well he just stands there waiting to be killed. This was quite an upsetting scene, i even paused a movie for a few minutes before i finished watching it to the end.Still, i won't go crazy and give it 1 point because of one upsetting scene like some people did. Probably this is because unlike the people in the theater i had an ability to pause the movie and calm down. Unlike some others i liked what i saw afterward and it made me forget about that scene by the end of the movie. During the movie there were a lot of great scenes, some of them really epic. The acting was almost perfect, really loved the actors work , the music was great, even the rap wasn't disturbing, but probably the movie would be better without it.Overall i really liked this movie and would recommend it to all the people, that are not afraid of violence of Tarantino's movies.",

Although maybe a comic strip interpretation it drives home the disparity between the English and African population before we entered our so called ' enlightened times' .I particularly like the (now) politically incorrect line of 'why are they staring at us... they have never seen a horse\" and how relates to the Caucasian outrage of seeing an African come riding into town in a casual manner.

The laziness of the screen writing is evident throughout - and to think this piece of literary garbage won best original screen play probably says more about the academy awards than it does about the film. The idea that a man brought up in slavery could pick up a rifle (a model not available for another 20 years) and hit a moving target on horseback from a distance with his first try is laughable, but is consistent the fact he also has perfect aim when first practicing his drawing a six shooter. It's explained away with the line \"he's got talent\". Nearly every white character in the movie dies. The excessive amount of blood and gore are only outdone by the Hollywood style lack of aim for anyone firing at the protagonist. Guns that were shoot through multiple bodies just seconds before (or moments after) cannot penetrate one if Django is behind it. Not to mention that the only guy the idiots at the door can hit, is the poor white guy wounded on the ground 2 feet in front of them (though they do pepper some poor guys corpse a few dozen times, while Django is using it for cover, but isn't really behind it at all). So, after ranting a bit, if you're looking for a senseless, bloody mess without much deep plot, this is your kind of movie. But, if you want to see a movie that at least attempts to be believable (and even the most fantastic Super Hero movie is more believable), then pass on this one and look for something else.",

The director again brings another great film for us to sit back and enjoy. With just the right amount of action, and a great plot to keep the viewers entertained with.Now with Jamie Foxx he hasn't been my favorite actor but in this role he really shines.They couldn't have found a better person.The movie overall is among the best films i have seen in awhile with a great director and a dynamite cast that keeps the excitement going, and Dicaprio did pretty well as the southern bad guy.The movie is MUCH more than just another rescue mission its a action film that brings back the old western days with a hint of our present times.",

King Schultz or even Stephen, the narrative is nice and doesn't changes much from any other movie, it's all lineal except for some flashbacks we'll have about djangos life before the start of what we saw in the movie, its themes are great and how the movie shows us what they used to do with black skin people at those times. So in conclusion if you like Tarantino movies you should definitely watch it and if you don't watch it anyway, it isn't a masterpiece but it's a great movie and a solid 8/10.",

It completely blew me away, once again Tarantino has delivered! Absolutely hilarious, totally bloody and extreme profanity from beginning to end. I would definitely put it with the best of his films, Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds.The film is set 2 years before the civil war and centres around a bounty hunter Dr Schultz (Waltz), a slave, Django (Foxx) and their quest to kill outlaws and rescue Django's wife (Washington) from a plantation owned by Calvin Candie (Dicaprio). The storyline is great and kept me hooked from the initial credits to the burning end. Absolutely loved Christoph Waltz as the dentist aka bounty hunter and I hope he collaborates with Tarantino a few more times in the future because he plays his characters perfectly. He's quickly becoming one of my favourite actors. I thought Jamie Foxx was a brilliant pick to play Django, he's fearless and yes he does get a little downplayed when on screen with other characters but I actually think this suits his character because he's a slave who wants to avoid a beating.As usual Leonardo Dicaprio delivers a superb performance and was quite terrifying! but Samuel L. Jackson completely stole it for me, I couldn't take my eyes off him.The supporting cast was superb as well I especially enjoyed James Remar and Jonah Hill's minor performances, I would have liked to have seen a little more of them.I sincerely hope Django picks up a few of the 5 Oscars it's been nominated for because Tarantino well and truly deserves them!",

            "content": "He has reason to believe one of the slaves might be of interest to him. He enters into negotiations to purchase Django, who he has reason to believe may help him in finding the Brittle brothers, for reasons involving the doctor's late wife. And already Tarantino has us, and it's off to the races. How odd that the path of the wagon and the slaves, which should have sailed past one another like two ships in the night, should meet head to head? He is a wizard from a fairy tale, a man capable of knowing about people's lives, steering their fates, seducing them into situations in which they receive the destinies they deserve. Although there is a great deal of the realistic in \"Django Unchained,\" including brutal violence, King Schultz is not real in the same way as the rest. A \"deus,\" for those few who may not, is a person or device in a story that appears from out of the blue and has a solution to offer. He refers to the conventions of Greek tragedy, where a crane was used to lower actors playing gods onto the stage\". Here is a plot that requires a lot of information, and does not have any time to lose in introducing it or searching for it. He also becomes the friend and partner of Django, gives him his freedom, and after a winter spent in using Django as his partner in bounty hunting, joins with him in trying to win back possession of Broomhilda , Django's wife. This is a brilliant entertainment, in which Tarantino takes on the subject of slavery as he did the Holocaust in his previous film, \"Inglourious Basterds\". To me, the most torturous thing in the world, and this counts for 'Reservoir Dogs' just as much as it does to 'Pulp,' is to watch it with an audience who does not know they are supposed to laugh. Because I am hearing the laughs in my mind, and there's this dead silence of crickets sounding in the audience, you know?\" I sorta know. It's a brutal fight, covered with the blood that flows unusually copiously in the film. The losing slave screams without stopping, and I reflected that throughout the film there is much more screaming in a violent scene than you usually hear. Finally the fight is over, and there's a shot of the defeated slave's head as a hammer is dropped on the floor next to it by Mr. At this point in the film I found myself mentally composing a letter to Quentin, explaining why I stopped watching his film. Do you remember Michael Madsen cutting off the cop's ear in \"Reservoir Dogs?\" When QT begins a movie, I believe, his destination is to aim over the top. At some point in the scene, QT's laughter may be because the audience expects to see violence but does not expect to get it a such an extreme; he's rubbing it in. Candie stages fights to the death with slaves called Mandingos, and Schultz says he wants to buy one of the fighters. That's clever misdirection with the mandingo as a cover story. This is such a flamboyant film that the most challenging performance in it, the one that rubs it in the most, actually runs the risk of being overlooked. He confronts Calvin with the obvious: It is Django who loves Broomhilde and desires her. Revealing this truth involves Stephen in a betrayal that in some respects is the most hateful action in the movie, because he sins not only against the others but against himself. Stephen is a crucial character because he forces African-American viewers to acknowledge the role some of their forebearers played at the time. Jackson's performance requires not only his gifts as an actor but his courage as a man who understands the utility of an obvious role and is willing to play it. The name \"von Shaft\" also reflects QT's wicked fondness for bringing distracting and outlandish names into the midst of dead-serious and violent material, as sort of a signal to the audience that Tarantino knows he's treading on the edge of parody. In this case, although the total comes to over 100, I understood it as a word in common daily use through the antebellum South. The film has also been attacked for its incredible level of violence, and that's what I was responding to in composing my imaginary letter to Tarantino. But it's not what a film does but how it does it, and in one sense the violence here reflects Tarantino's desire to break through audience's comfort level for exploitation films and insist, yes, this was a society and culture that was inhuman.",

            "content": "The only thing i hate more about Tarantino movies is the end... it hits me like a sledgehammer when i realize that it will be two or three more for another one, and no other director leaves its mark the way Tarantino does.Someone said that he is not a director but a Genre of cinema, you have horror, action, comedy, crime, drama, etc, etc, then you just say... it's a Tarantino movie, and for the geek or movie lover thats enough.I was more excited for Django than i was for Inglorious Basterds, only for Dicaprio, it's one of those actors that brings everything to the screen, he did since the very great big role (in my opinion) of its career, Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can, a month before the Martin Scorcese epic Gangs of New York. I did not like him, is face was just to perfect, did not like him him titanic nor the beach, but he became an actor in Catch Me If You Can, then of course after Gangs of NY sent him to the stars when he did not stop partnering with the legendary Scorcese.The first evil character of his career, from what i've read, and one of the most scary and incredibly vivid characters that i've seen in a few years, i remember people talking about Christoph Waltz's charismatic character on Basterds, that people loved to hate, and for that he won the his first Oscar, and well deserved. But he was not evil, he was a psychopath that was just very cool, too cool, to relaxed, not showing more than a serial killer would show while talking to the police.Now Leo's Calvin Candie was vivid and extravagant, he did not talk with his mouth he talked with he's entire face and hands, you laughed when he talked on those silly/serious parts, but when that, always present scenes in every Tarantino movie, when the characters sit down and things go from serious to utterly psychopathic interrogation/conversation table talks, just like that amazingly powerful tavern talk on Basterds.But by god... i jumped inside and out, when the already visibly annoyed but calm Calvin Candie explodes, to enraged psycho... sweet Jesus. I saw an interview with him, Foxx and Tarantino where Foxx told that he (dicaprio) was having difficulties channeling the character due to the 'N' word, but Foxx and Sam Jackson told him to go full throttle cause people realize when it's not real, and he had to be.And my friends... he was, that last part he showed all the evil that was probably as real on screen as it was back at that time, i do not get impressed that easily with characters like these cause in movies with serial killers like Lecter or Jigsaw and others then tend to not express emotions, because that's the reality.But that would never be the case in any Tarantino movie, Christoph Waltz on Basterds character was scary and incredibly intelligent, just like Jules Winnfield (Sam Jackson) in Pulp Fiction, great lines of conversations that will remain in history of cinema.Tarantino said he likes more to write novels than movies, Inglorious Basterds was supposed to be a novel, that's why he writes every single line to every character like he would do for a masterpiece novel, every uttered word grabs the audience like the action and violence on the movie, you almost see the words like a graffiti on screen. And of course every word comes with a gesture and a facial movement, either Christoph Waltz or Dicaprio are both brilliant.Now everything else, the violence, the action, are Tarantino's Tags, and of course the Soundtrack is unique to him, it's like watching a movie that is also a big video clip with 4 or 5 genres of music, from hip hop to country to rock, for the average cinema lover, it will be difficult to accept the way its shot, the music of course, it does not match to what you're knowledge of western is, and the less serious tone of the matter as well.Not even Spielberg or Scorcese get to have there marks on films, love them, get always excited when their films come out, as well as David Fincher, Christopher Nolan, Paul Thomas Anderson and some others, Tarantino as a mark, the mark that usually is seen on independent films, the films that Hollywood does not like cause it's too outside the box, and Tarantino it's so outside that the box it's not even in the horizon. You either like the art of movie making or you just like movies thats the difference between Quentin Tarantino and everyone else.PS. Dicaprio was finally on a Tarantino film, now please go for Denzel, Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, DeNiro (again), Morgan Freeman, Vincent D'Onofrio, bah... too many already.",

            "content": "I can remember how delighted I was by Pulp Fiction, and Django Unchained is just as good. There is a really rewarding trajectory in the unpredictable yet enthralling story, and the nearly 3 hours weren't at all a strain: not for a moment was I bored. All the actors gave fine and involving performances, but Christopher Waltz stole every scene he was in, just as he did in Inglourious Basterds (which for my money, though still quite good, isn't in the same league): he is so very engaging, and thoroughly deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor, as did Tarantino for best script--I was beginning to think he'd lost his mojo, but he's back here on top form.What can you say about Tarantino? What would cinema be like without what he's added to the canon? Indubitably, impoverished. It's like he's pulled back the curtains in a long-locked room to reveal a new way of looking at seemingly clich\u00e9d genres like crime fiction, and here, the Western. Never in a month of Sundays would I have imagined him tackling a Western, but here he does it with great panache and freshness. I'd love to see what a Tarantino science fiction flick would be like. After all, he has done the vampire thing with From Dusk Till Dawn, and it wouldn't be too far a stretch--and what the heck, I like science fiction; it's ripe for a bit of Tarantino-isation.Besides Waltz, I thought Leonardo DiCaprio gave a lively performance as a villain, and whilst it might be easy to downplay Jamie Foxx's as a hero, one has to remember that he played his role just about right: rather laconically, which after all was how his part was written. I can't think of another actor who might have bettered it.I've just watched it on DVD and will be giving it another viewing right after this review: I want to savour the nuances I might have missed, and to re-experience the Tarantino-esque fusion of realism with a kind of fantasy. Though on the face of it, he often deals with offensive material, because that fantasy element is always there, it's very difficult to actually be offended because one is transported to a mythic kind of realm where he's never trying to hit you over the head with earnestness: this is cinematic entertainment, and he never lets you forget it. You don't ever have to feel any kind of guilt because hey, this is a story, and a thunderingly good one, right?",

            "content": "I love Quentin Tarantino's old films. For designing the fighting scenes, interesting soundtracks, spectacular scenes, for his attitude to the script. Many of his films are proof of his meticulous attention to detail and demanding acting.After viewing \u00abDjango Liberated\u00bb there was a feeling of some fulfillment and satisfaction, so fully transferred the film to Tarantino. The script is decent: no stupid incoherent phrases, flat jokes, in general, all that the film could do without, except for a little protracted moments, some unnecessary dialogues, as the characters say on the merits. The term \"Tarantino dialogues\" did not come from a vacuum.But Tarantino did not sit in vain: he came up with these unexpected scenes well - he did not go the beaten path. It was impossible to say right away, this one would definitely die, but this one would not, but this one would be avenged. The scene of the battle, or one might say \"destruction\" in the mansion is striking in its colors.The film stars Jamie Fox, with Christoph Waltz as his key partner. The hero of Christophe Waltz - the doctor and bounty hunter King Schultz, seemingly cynical and cruel, hiding behind these traits is a strict desire for justice, of course motivated by monetary rewards. The protagonist, Django, who is played flawlessly by Jamie Fox, does not appear in the film immediately, and plays Schultz's assistant. The former slave Django becomes like his mentor and adopts his qualities, even surpassing him. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is admired - a versatile actor who in each film is different. His hero, Calvin Candy, is a violent slave owner who at first glance seems very charming. Before the film's climax, Calvin Candy smiles at the protagonists with a smirk, revealing his black half-rotten teeth, and the director reveals that Candy himself is rotten. Samuel Lee Jackson played perfectly the bad butler Stephen, played so well that I hated his hero. Unfortunately pleased only the male part of the cast of the film, female roles did not please me, for example, the game of Carrie Washington - Django's beloved wife - Broomhilda, did not seem the strongest.There is a narrative about the lives of slaves and their owners. Their attitude towards them and punishment: for escape, for disobedience... Quite revealing scenes, because we know Quentin - he likes clarity. Tarantino well thought up these unexpected scenes - did not go the beaten path. It was impossible to say right away, this one would get revenge, this one would definitely die, and this one wouldn't.Regarding some idea, he does not break stereotypes, because he has already done it in his own \u00abInfamous bastards\u00bb, but in \u00abDjango\u00bb raises ideas of revenge of the oppressed in absolute. At the same time, the director's position is clear as ever: people do not deserve to be stray dogs just because of the color of their skin or origin, the reason for classifying a person as scum or a higher layer - his actions that can elevate or, on the contrary, humiliate him.Another bright and strong film, breathtaking. The director and representatives of the cast are nominated for many awards. Tarantino can already boast the award for best script, quite deservedly.In general, I could play 9 out of 10 and recommend the film for viewing.",

But the stand out for me was DiCaprio, definitely the best performance he has done to date and of course what would a QT film be without Samuel L Jackson, who is also brilliant. The cinematography equals that of Kill Bill, and dare i say possibly surpasses it?! The script is well written and has a good story line. It features the use of the 'N' word frequently and contains strong language. Of course it has that gory feel all the great QT flicks have.There was one scene that felt as though it didn't belong in the movie and that was the 'bags on the head scene' where there is a peculiar appearance from Jonah Hill.All in all a fantastic watch for both QT lovers and people who have never seen anything from his filmography.

People who admire gratuitous violence normally aren't sitting for two hours to engage in the dialogue. The shoot outs are over the top if you're into the Grindhouse genre, a la the latest Rambo. But face it folks, Tarantino is given free reign from the ignorant masses to be as grotesque and violent as he wants, as long as he blames the entire South on the way Jamie Foxx's love interest is treated (along with all the blacks) in pre-Civil War America.

            "content": "If i had to sum this movie up in one word, it would be impossible. It is everything. Violent, gory, hilarious, crude, thrilling, PERFECT. The story is set two years before the civil war and is about a bounty hunter named Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) who sets a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx) free so that he can help him identify three brothers that were formerly at the plantation Django lived on because they were wanted dead or alive for murder. While helping Dr. King, Django informs him about his wife that had been transferred to another plantation after their attempted and failed escape. They then begin to work together and bounty hunting partners as they also make a journey to reunite the two lovers. This movie is an instant classic and just an absolute masterpiece of work done by Quentin Tarantino. The plot was a work of art and the mood which was set was a very impressive mix of Western with modern language, personalities, and attitudes from the films characters. Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Samuel L. Jackson provided performances that are incredible. I must say that it had to be some of the best acting I have ever seen in a film.Although the story line of this movie is very serious it also has a nice touch of often humor throughout, which can of course be expected in a movie directed by Tarantino. I have no complaints of this humor at all though,I loved it and found myself laughing hysterically in several scenes. This film is also extremely violent and gory throughout but the action of it all is wonderful. The battle scenes are very thrilling and bloody with all of the shooting that occurs but it appeared very well on screen and was easy to see what exactly was going on in the action.If the great film work, dialogue, and plot wasn't enough all ready to make this movie perfect then the little extra pieces to it completed it. The humor was the major bonus but there were other little parts that just made it even better like the unexpected momentary appearance of Jonah Hill who was a part of a rather hilarious scene. This movie just flowed perfectly and was a movie for the ages. One of the best pieces of film work ever to be done and a honest and true huge success once again for the great Quentin Tarantino.",

I could not figure out how in the hell could he get that very amazing soundtracks in his movies -he always dazzles me with this ability -that are very fitting to the events they are used for .Regarding the characters ; every body was perfect Christoph Waltz was as usual very brilliant Leonardo DiCaprio 's role was also very amazing, as well as Jamie Fox and Samuel L.Jackson. Concerning the Comparison that would be held between it and other movies of the Same year like TDKR, I believe that these are entirely different genres as different as their directors where Nolan is Focusing on the Plot & the Twist and is the new master of thrillers -IMO-, while Tarantino is the King of the Entertaining genre -If there is something to be named so :)- & also is one of the best ever writers. any way I believe that it is one of Tarantino 's best work ever , & it is highly recommended .",

Set in the Old South , the story follows a slave Django who was given freedom and the opportunity to trace down his lost wife. The story touches upon a topic which many Hollywood film makers would find uncomfortable to show. But many details were paid to with great attention . But what really defined this movie from the other action flicks in the industry was the purely the story and the characters that defined it. Characters played by Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz were very pure and impactive . But the character who has a permanent place in our hearts and minds would be \"Monsieur Candie\" . Bringing Hollywood Golden boy Leonardo Di Caprio to portray the villain is what captured many moviegoers . The antagonists in this movie were some of the finest ones we have seen in the past few years . Samuel L Jackson's character of a house slave is much deeper and his motives are more than meets the eye. Unlike other slaves, Stephen( Jackson) enjoys being oppressed . His title of house slave is the highest rank amongst slaves and he enjoys his advantage in the hierarchy . Messing up the ranks would make him like any other slave . He enjoyed being treated special. Overall, the movie was highly enjoyable and very \"detailed\". Unlike the previous movies of over the top gore(classic Tarantino) this movie did not have excessive blood. Cameos of Don Johnson and Franco Nero were well timed and not irrelevant .",

Fans of Tarantino's work will definitely appreciate it. For those who aren't that familiar with his work, beware: violence, blood and galore in overloads. The soundtrack is perfectly chosen from the music Tarantino had at home: it definitely plays an important part in setting the atmosphere. The universe is sordid, the plot is worse, some scenes - two, to be precise- had me nearly throwing up. Despite that, I won't criticize the level of violence in the movie. I don't think it's unneeded. On the contrary, it is a very important part of that universe. Black people were killed and tortured; it should shock you. Sparing the viewer's sensibilities would also spare him the full extent of the horror implied. So no, it's not needlessly violent. The movie will have you on the edge of your seat and I guarantee you won't even realize how long it is. It's definitely worth viewing.",

I found the movie to be one of the most gruesome films I've ever seen - yes, ALSO taking a step in another direction from let's say... Irreversible etc. Just because it is a blockbuster.

            "review_title": "Django Unchained (2013)",
            "content": "With any Quentin Tarantino film the expectation is always going to be at its highest. So what starts off as a new good looking film from QT turns into more of an event. Django really did live up to my expectations and I hope any other QT fan out there thought the same. When he first announced the release of Django Unchained, I thought okay another meaningless title, what is it going to bring and is it going to be as good as his previous films, is this is where it goes down hill for Quentin. Really I was just being pessimistic. Because yes it was just as intriguing as any other of his previous films. Quentin's love for cult cinema is commonly unknown by many, which was why I knew there was a western being loaded into the Quentin cannon anytime soon. He mentioned in one of his interviews that a big inspiration to him was Sergio Leone and his classic spaghetti western 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. So to see Quentin tackle the ethics of the western genre made the release that much more of a double event. But strictly speaking Django isn't a western. If anything it should be tagged as a 'Southern' coming from the man himself. It has nothing to do with the western genre. Unlike Inglorious Bastards, Django doesn't try to be a riot and doesn't try to be as politically correct as possible (referring to WW2). It concentrates more on character development, pointing at Django (Jamie Foxx). For the first time in Quentin history the story is more linear and concentrates on the portrayal and the story of one character's journey. Also there are no shifts in time like Quentin's previous films. We don't see Travolta being shot by Willis and then reappearing in a later scene which is based before that scene. This doesn't leave you so confused but that doesn't mean you're not left confused at times during the film. After all that is QT job. Which is why as Quentin fans we need to see the film another two to three times to get the full QT experience. Also we don't get 'Chapter 2' or anything like that. Django goes for the more 'Rescue the princess' type theme. The story sees Django a slave being \"Unchained\" by a bounty hunter slash dentist Dr King Schultz (QT latest discovery Christoph Waltz) who won his deserved Oscar for Inglorious Bastards in 2009. However over the campfire he is amazed to know that Django is married to another slave called Broomhilda Von Shaft (Kerry Washington) even though Foxx and Washington played a couple in Ray. Now as this is a 'Rescue the princess' film, there is a villain. Django Unchained's finest element is the new Robert De Niro, AKA Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie. A plantation owner in the south. Who keeps slaves including Django's love. QT tries to make him a perfect, spiteful, prone to flattery, selfish, vain man who wants nothing else but money. But the result is naive and funny which doesn't disappoint. Now me being negative. Quentin's attempt to include black comedy leaves the viewer slightly confused and doesn't want to know why they are confused either. I know there has been some controversy on the films running time and frankly it is not long ENOUGH. It flew by for me and I feel that some scenes could have been longer but I have a hunch they were shortened for the best. But other than that the only other advice is don't watch the trailer as it doesn't do the film justice! In conclusion Django Unchained is a delight to watch from two hours before the film starts to the end credits. Verdict: Another bloody, well scripted masterpiece that QT has fed to our hungry eyes. Django really does help define QT as one of the finest directors in modern day filming. The only issue now is, can he keep it up?",

            "content": "I'm a late bloomer and never got the chance to watch Django Unchained in the cinemas. That was a huge mistake because after watching it for the first time last night I suddenly realised how much of a fool I was for not bothering to see it on the big screen! The writing is unbelievable! Quite possibly the best script in the history of the world as each character was so fascinating and well delivered with their lines. Also Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal as the pompous-yet-charming Calvin Candie is the best thing that DiCaprio has ever done (and yes, I've seen Wolf of Wall Street and Gilbert Grape). I was never bored of this film from start to finish simply because of how clever the narrative was. I understand that Tarantino are a little disappointed in the route that he's going to at the moment as he used to make witty-gangster films and now he's making action-flicks, but I think in my personal opinion it's the best film that he's made since Pulp Fiction (not that you care but the Tarantino film I least cared for was Death Proof - what was it? a killer car with a man inside who hated women or something?) Jamie Foxx was fantastic and going back to DiCaprio this is Foxx's best performance as I was getting quite sick of his somewhat 'cool' characters that he always seems to play. I mean, yes he's technically doing all that in this film as he's supposed to be this awesome Shaft-like character, but it's the rise of a hero with pride, the birth of a nation, the start of something new in the world. This film doesn't educate you I know however it was so entertaining all the way through! I only had one criticism, it being Samuel L. Jackson's performance (please don't hunt me down and kill me in cold blood). I love Jackson as I think he's the coolest actor ever, but I was a little let-down by his weird portrayal of Stephen the somewhat racist black servant of Candie. It was like he was trying to play an old man in a theatre production somewhere.But that's it! The best Tarantino film I've seen for a while (2nd being Pulp Fiction and 3rd being Inglorious Basterds).",

Its hard to (Spike) criticize the movie since its not happening in any semblance of the real world, rather, its an obscene fairy tale, a violent fable (No, Hitler was not machined gunned to death in a French theater, and Mississippi was not so accepting of black bounty hunters right before they seceded from the Union). Still, if you can let go of trying to rationalize the myth (Brynhildr and Siegfried would agree) what you have here is some incredible acting- and when I say that I mean Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson, who collectively create the most unusual antagonist on screen I have seen in some time (Bravo SLJ- people in the theater were yelling back at you on screen- astonishing performance). Its not as good as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, but its certainly a departure from the usual. Cant wait to see what QT does next- America wins in Vietnam maybe?",

Jamie Foxx pulled off a style (later in his character development) that I haven't seen in a western character in a long time and loved. SOME of the soundtrack is good... the parts that sound like a Western soundtrack. Given that the movie starts off with classic Western music and titles, my hopes were up.The Bad:The Music: the occasional and random rap songs took me out of the moment that the acting pulled me into. Completely ruined the mood and the immersion. This movie could have been incredible if it had stuck to the Western-style score.The Violence: The blood, which is prolific, is very fake looking, a pale red and in cartoonish amounts. While I think a rated R western could work out very well (just dial up True Grit's PG13 violence slightly), this comicbook - style violence broke the immersion of the otherwise very realistic setting (the brutality of the pre civil war south). Poor style choice alongside the random rap pieces makes you feel like this is Black Panther: 1859 edition.The Editing: While in some ways the cinematography was very well done, the post processing adds some very strange and unsettling filters to many of the shots. I found it to be highly annoying.Ultimately, the climactic moments of this film ended up leaning heavily on the aspects of the filmmaking that I did not like, which was unfortunate. In my book, this movie was so close to being a 9/10, but for a few choices in the making that make parts of it neigh unwatchable.",

I also thought the cinematography was excellent; he understands light and works so well with it. One of the best scenes of all time: when Leonardo DeCaprio pulls up to his plantation with Django on a horse and Samual L Jackson goes off on him. The back and forth they have will be a classic.

Slavery is a subject on which modern Hollywood is traditionally nervous, a reticence amounting almost to a conspiracy of silence \u2013 except, of course, in the explicit context of abolition. Good as they are, Foxx, DiCaprio, Waltz and Washington are utterly upstaged by Samuel L Jackson, who gives an extraordinary performance as Stephen, Candie's household attendant, an Uncle Tom figure utterly and aggressively loyal to the white master, with a deathly stare, a disturbing, Parkinson's-type tremor and a habit of dropping the N-bomb more aggressively than anyone else (and heaven knows everyone is dropping it pretty aggressively).",

Between Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz, the dialog is sharp, witty, and at times humorous. To be sure, this movie is not a \"white-bashing\" fest, rather it differentiates between the decent white man and the slave owner. It is satisfying to see what many black folk would have loved to see happen during the days of slavery, as those responsible for the cruelty inflicted upon the slaves are held responsible by paying the ultimate price for their crimes. The music can be a bit annoying from time to time, but it seems to serve a purpose as it's reminiscent of the blaxploitation films of the 1970s. Leonardo DiCaprio has indeed grown up and has come a long ways since the days of \"Titanic.\" I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who lives to see justice doled out the way it was before current laws protected the criminals. I normally don't care for Quentin Tarantino films as they seem a bit odd and beyond full understanding, but this movie is an exception. Well done! I cannot imagine how he could possibly follow this up with a sequel, but one can only hope that he outshines this one if he does.",

            "content": "On the Eve of \"Reservoir Dogs\" 20th UK anniversary by director Quentin Tarantino, a handful of friends and I paid tribute \u2013 in true \"dogs\" fashion\" - by dressing to impress in black suits, white shirts and black ties to see \"Django Unchained\" - the directors first take on a \"Spaghetti Western\" in his longest feature film to date.\"Django Unchained\" set in the antebellum South two years before the American Civil War tells the story of Django (played by Jamie Foxx) - a once slave turned freeman - who in return for identifying the \"Brittle Brothers\" for his German Dentist - turned Bounty Hunter companion Dr King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), sets out to rescue his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from her slave master Monsieur Calvin Candie, a charming, profound racist and Francophile owner of \"Candyland\" - a brutal Mississippi plantation - (played by Leonardo DiCaprio). Schultz and Django devise a plan to lure Candie into selling Django's wife Broomhilda, vindicating that she helps relieve Schultz' nostalgia for his mother tongue because she speaks German. But once loyal house slave Stephen (played by Samuel L. Jackson) surmises that Django and Broomhilda know each other, informs his master Candie, he now realises that the generous offer from Django and Dr King Schultz was all too good to be true, a decision that doesn't end well for both parties.Firstly I would like to point out that I have been a lifelong admirer of Tarantino's work and I believe that his latest installment \"Django Unchained\" is one of his best. \"Django Unchained\" marks the first Tarantino feature film I have been aged to see on the 'big screen' and what a difference the cinematic experience makes. Quentin Tarantino for all that he is - is a fantastic film maker. He captures all the aspects of a true \"Spaghetti Western\" with ease - close ups, shoot outs, stare downs and memorable Tarantino one liners. And not to mention the extensive use of ketchup style fake blood! Quentin Tarantino's music score for \"Django Unchained\" is an admirable blend of definitive \"Spaghetti Western\" orchestras' mixed with contemporary music, inheriting a soundtrack meeting the criteria of a classic \"Spaghetti Western\", interim with a modern twist. The title song \"Django\" - by composer Luis Bacalov - from the 1966 film by the same name and the on-screen cameo of Franco Nero - the protagonist in the original film, worked fittingly as a tribute from Tarantino to the inspiration of his latest film - Django meets Django! Jamie Foxx was giving the green light by director Quentin Tarantino to play the central role of Django in \"Django Unchained\". Unfortunately for him he was overshadowed by the Oscar winning performance by Austrian born actor Christoph Waltz for his supporting role as Dr King Shultz -Tarantino's latest collaborator. As an Oscar winning actor I had high hopes for Foxx's role in this film but I found he was the films major flaw. Foxx felt far too contemporary for a film set in the 19th century, his acting at times felt lazy and he looked unconvincing during various action sequences. Although I thought his performance improved in the later stages of the film when the films focus was purely on Django and not his partnership with Schultz. Waltz' second to none performance as Dr King Shultz steals the show, with his sheer elegance, wit and intelligent acting. Kerry Washington's supporting role in the film is strong, having previously collaborated with actor Jamie Foxx in the 2004 Oscar winning film 'Ray', reprising her role as Foxx's in film wife Broomhilda, the romance scenes between the two worked well in the film, especially towards the films climax. Leonardo Di Caprio marks his Tarantino debut in true fashion, emerging himself well into Tarantino's style of acting, producing a remarkable piece of acting as slave owner Monsieur Candy. Samuel L Jackson adds a touch of sheer class to the film in his role as Candies house slave Stephen with some much needed humour,nothing but the best from a true Tarantino veteran actor, receiving the on-screen time he deserves. Quentin Tarantino himself makes a returns to the screen after a notable absence from film, in a brief cameo appearance as an Australian LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Employee. 'Django Unchained' is a film that deserved the 2013 Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. I've never been to the cinema before where the audience has been completely captivated from start to finish. The film both shocks you and makes you laugh. The music score as with many Tarantino features is fantastic. The cinematography in Django is mesmerising and captures the Western feel brilliantly. The casting is first-class (bar a sense of contemporary-ism from the lead actor!) which incorporates some new faces to the Tarantino universe along with some more well known collaborators. I'm well aware that the films subject matter and the inclusion of graphic, violent scenes may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I feel If you can accept a Tarantino style of film for what it is you can enjoy it far more. After all, you wouldn't expect anything less from the controversial director.",

I really enjoyed the interpretation of Cristoph Waltz, unfortunately his contribute could have been bigger if he had remained alive until the end of the story. I can understand that Django was the main character...but it was Dr. Schultz who made it. Without him, he was just a slave. Plus, in few seconds the action just lost two of its most important actors. The all idea of a former slave becoming a free man is interesting and quite innovative for that period, credits for that, but that's all.About Tarantino, even though I'm not an expert on movies direction, I would say this one has too many speechless and boring song periods. Not really my type, but it is naturally subjective. It is worth seeing, but it was not memorable for me.",

This is a movie which talks about slavery in 19th century America and how Black people were illtreated by white people! Almost the entire movie is made to offend with frequent use of the 'N' word against blacks and almost every white character in this movie is shown to be racist. Most shocking is Leonardo Di caprio's character who is just plain offensive to say the least and this movie has potential to destroy his career in long run! I am shocked an actor of his status and calibre agreed to star in this flick! And why oh why did they have that skull speech scene where Leo's character explains the reasons for black people being submissive towards white people (at that time that is)!

Each of the five star cast contribute five star performances, particularly both Leo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. DiCaprio, who very rarely disappoints in any role, is cast the villainous slave-owner Calvin Candie, a character who DiCaprio himself described as \"the most deplorable human being he'd ever read in a screenplay in his life\" - although he must not have been deplorable enough to turn down... or maybe that was the attraction. Samuel L. Jackson is his senior house slave, Stephen, and puts in a performance like never before. Completely loyal to Candie, Stephen is overly suspicious of all goings-on around him, which brings us on to the lead protagonist Django, played astutely by Jamie Foxx. Django is separated from his wife and longs to reacquaint himself with her. Christophe Waltz portrays the best deceptively calm character i think i've ever seen - much like the one he played in Inglorious Basterds. As Dr. King Schultz he frees Django and takes him under his wing. The dialogue is often poetic, yet does not shy away from crassness (as if Mr. Tarantino would ever comprehend such a thing).

            "content": "This movie to me is one of the best movies of 2012 and Quentin Tarantino's best movie that is great as his other masterpiece Pulp Fiction. The story is about a slave Jango (the \"D\" is silent) played by Jamie Foxx rescued by a bounty hunter (played by Quentin Tarantino's lucky acting cram Christoph Waltz in another best acting role of his). They soon become partners in the bounty hunting bushiness and plan to rescue Django's wife held as a slave by the villainous Leonardo DiCaprio (in a great role of his career) and the evil and sneaky Samuel L. Jackson (who turns out is the real brains behind this slave ring). The action is great and pretty funny like most Quentin's films and it is not only a great tribute to Spaghetti Westerns by Quentin, but to me a great tribute to the two directors who help Mr. Tarantino make his first movie Tony Scott and Ulu Grosbard who died on the year of this film's release before it came out. I notice the tributes to them in this film more than other people did. For Ulu Grosbard, Quentin pay tributes to his films such as True Confessions (the partnership with Dr. King Schultz and Django), Falling in Love (Django and his wife's romance), The Deep End of the Ocean (Broomhilda surprised to have finally meet Django again) and Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me? (in scenes including Jamie Foxx in a snow hill scene in the same way as Dustin Hoffman in the movie). For Tony Scott, it was mostly the action scenes (especially the big battle in Candy Land) are tributes to his films True Romance, Enemy of the State, The Last Boy Scout and Domino. What should of make the film better is that the credits should of have \"Dedicated to Ulu and Tony\" the same as Clint Eastwood dedicated Unforgiven to Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. But along with \"In Memory of Sally Menke and J. Michael Riva\". That was the only thing that I criticize the movie about is Quentin should of dedicated his movie to Tony Scott, Ulu Grosbard, Sally Menke and J. Michael Riva who died before the film was release. Over all, this is still a great movie and very good tributes to Western and Tony Scott and Ulu Grosbard. I say its worth checking out, if you love colorful funny bloody action and Quentin films you will love it. Its funny, action packed, original and has good acting and action.",

He and his character served their purpose and Waltz was just fine in the role, but nothing to highly praise. DiCaprio as Calvin Candie was nothing worth noting. Either its in the performance or the script, I never really invested in him. It's as if Tarantino wanted to write a great movie villain and that's what DiCaprio took as his only direction.

Great actors have made a great job. Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Fox, Kerry Washington, Christoph Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson are part of the main cast of the movie, and those, in my opinion, deserved an Oscar. Set during slavery in 1858, it's the history of Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by Dr. King Schultz, who hires him as a killer to kill three brothers that are villains. After killing them, they go after Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is a slave of Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who is the owner of a farm named Candieland.. Calvin has a slave named (Samuel L. Jackson), who is important to the end of the movie. The movie is bloody, violent, with a lot of racist words and with a very intelligent script, which was successfully played by the cast. It's also funny and sad, where the acid dialogs on it are connected to the way that black people were treated at that time. Another important point is the soundtrack, which has a large variety of styles, going through rap until electronic music. The photography is also fantastic. Tarantino has created an excellent job again.

With Django, QT gives a balls-out Western with his signature brand of revenge-fantasy that hits closer to home than most Americans would feel comfortable with. And therein lies the true achievement of this film, going where other filmmakers would not and giving us a gut-punch of a film that hearkens back to his devil-may-care attitude he brought with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.Django Unchained is the story of Django, a black slave who is recruited by German bounty hunter Schulz into the game of murder-for-hire. After some classic Western guru tutelage, the pair embark on a rescue mission to free Django's wife Broomhilda from the clutches the sadistic dandy Calvin Candie. As per usual with QT, the simple plot is merely the foundation upon which witty dialog, multi-layered characters, outstanding performances, and of course, ultra-violence is stacked to create an epic film that raises pulses as well as a few questions.Past the controversy about \"n-words,\" racism, how accurately the portrayal of one of America's darkest chapters is, there is a series of questions the film asks of its audience once the cheers, laughter, and uncomfortable squirming have died down. How can one group hold themselves above another so much that they cease to think of them as human? How does a country wage a war against a tyrannical monarchy with the belief that \"all are created equal\" and then go to treating people as cattle to be sold, whipped, and slaughtered at will? And if you were one of those on the lower rung of that particular power structure, what would you do if, even for one minute, the tables were suddenly flipped? These are issues that are universal, as the human race has had a long history of one group of powerful people subjugating others based on boundaries such as class, religion, or in this case, race.QT has pretty much been exploring these ideas since Kill Bill. Whether using the Bride as a metaphor for abused women, the Basterds as the victimized Jewish people, or Django as the black American, the Tarantino ensemble serve up a bloody dish of entertainment that can actually serve to enlighten in a way few filmmakers can.",

This episode didn't move the story on. So why include it? I can only think that, although the director had the ability and resources to make an intelligent film, he was worried he would lose the interest of the less sophisticated end of the market. Then the film gets going again, as a storyline develops of the pair hatching a plot to rescue Brunhilde ('Broomhilda') from her plantation owner. At this point we meet the other of the really good actors (Samuel Jackson as the plantation's aged family retainer). I'd advise stopping watching at the point when the German gets shot. After that it's crowd-pleasers, the sort of thing that populates film trailers - shootings, explosions. Exciting a generation ago maybe but we've seen it all before.

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino has become famous for his unique direction, his love of violence and his dramatic, controversial style of screenplay writing; his latest film, \"Django Unchained\", is no exception. The film's feel of a classic \"spaghetti Western\" is clear, with the first town scene looking just like it could have come out of a 1960s Marlon Brando epic, but also combines the angles and camera style that we are used to from a Tarantino film. The aesthetics make it very pleasant to the eye, but the film never becomes stale or lulls you into a false sense of security - just when you least expect it, a sudden zoom or unexpected angle puts you on the edge, making you focus again on what is going on on screen, and more importantly the issues it is exploring. My favourite example of this was when the camera quickly zooms to a close up on DiCaprio when we first see his face, highlighting both the importance of this character but also making the audience disorientated slightly, as the majority of the film has been slow or static before, allowing the audience to mentally shake themselves and focus harder on the picture. The film explores the theme of slavery greatly throughout, with surprising and shocking historical accuracy. The racism is harsh, with the word \"nigger\" being used over one hundred times, by both blacks and whites, leading to great controversy throughout the world. \"We don't use the word any more than it would have been used in 1858 in Mississippi\" Tarantino has said, which is very true; a film set in a certain period exploring certain issues has to come with certain baggage,and obviously language is one. You wouldn't make a World War Two film without using the word Nazi, would you? This for me makes the film very successful, and in my opinion good cinema has to create discussion, which this film certainly does. I went to see \"Lincoln\", where I saw, amongst other things, the use of the word \"nigger\". Just because it's used less than in \"Django Unchained\", why should that make it any less \"shocking\" or \"acceptable\"? Important questions that need to be discussed, and ones that Tarantino is keen to explore.The film also is extensively violent, with the death count off the scale and the levels of blood great. For me however, I think that the outrage of it in this film is rather unfounded, and that it is nothing, compared to say, the final fight scene in \"Kill Bill: Vol 1\". When Tarantino shows violence it is always slightly comic, especially if it is a quick death or if he doesn't want to draw much attention to it - whilst shooting their bounty, Schultz and Django create a vast spurt of the red stuff and the body hits the ground. Laughable, silly, and not greatly scarring or terrible. However, what Tarantino also does in this film is brutally show violence that would have happened to blacks all over America in this time period. When we see a terrified Mandingo fighter in a tree surrounded by dogs, we know that probably happened thousands of times. When Tarantino slowly and methodically shows us his limbs being torn from him by the dogs, we know that this violence would have been every day for the slaves on these kinds of plantations. To me, this violence is once again part of the \"baggage\" that comes along with both the subject and with a Tarantino film, so if you're offended by it you only have yourself to blame; it's not as if Tarantino isn't famous for violent films, is it? To go back to \"Lincoln\", although there is not as much violence as in \"Django Unchained\", the two films deal with similar issues, and at the start of \"Lincoln\" we see bayonets piercing the heart and lungs of soldiers. Just because there isn't a spurt of scarlet doesn't make it any less violent; it seems that blood is the deciding factor to if a film is a 12a or an 18, or as some have called \"Django Unchained\", \"unclassifiable\".Overall, \"Django Unchained\" is a thought-provoking, highly original and fantastic work of cinema. As one critic has said, \"it has something for everyone to hate\", but I feel it also has something for everyone to love. The acting, cinematography and direction is superb, and with the box-office numbers to back it up, it is easy to say that this film is one of Tarantino's greatest. The script won the \"BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay\", and it is easy to see why gained and how deserving of such an accolade it is. Although being rather long (2 hours 45 minutes), I never felt that there was anything unnecessary in the picture. Although some parts were grinding on my human morals and difficult to watch, I feel that these all added to the intense and overall feel of the film, and for me it has made it an instant classic and one of my new favourite films.",

            "content": "Just came out of the theater about 30 minutes ago and I still feel like a snowglobe someone shook too hard. This is one hell of a long movie. There are no slow bits except the one useful talky bit where I desperately had to get up and pee about halfway through. Use that bit like an intermission, but hurry, because it doesn't last long. First off, full disclosure, I like Quentin Tarentino flicks. I think they're energetic, crazy, turned up to 11, and entertaining without being idiotic. He's a guy who loves movies, loves theater, and makes what he loves. And in some ways, I think this is the movie he's been practicing for with all his other movies. This could be the best thing he's ever made. The best thing everyone involved has ever been in. Second, some minor spoilers below. Don't read this unless you've seen it. Go in and get surprised. So I knew before we were in that there would be blood, profanity, and bad guys. No surprises there. I've seen some other reviews where folks were surprised by the use of the word n****r. (I had to redact that, IMDb won't let me write it out. Contextually it was appropriate and accurate, but their filter is meant for the vast majority of submissions and it's good that they won't allow it, so.) I was neither particularly surprised nor particularly offended (Situationally, in the past I've been both amused and nauseated by it, depending on the intent behind the use.) In this instance, in this movie, it was used a lot. Maybe dozens of times, over and over, in every possible context, with every possible intonation behind it. It was not used gratuitously even once, though; every single use was intended and purposeful. I think what people are freaked about is something that was done carefully, deliberately, with at least two goals in mind: to illustrate something to our modern minds about the time period, and to be historically accurate. That's important because there were two faces to this movie. One of them is brutally accurate, and the other is almost like a revenge dream. Those faces switch without warning in the space of a millisecond. On the brutally accurate side are things that are sad or funny, like the outfit Django picks when he's free to pick his own clothing, and things that are very much not funny, like hauling a slave out of a hot box as though she were meat. On the dream-like side are the giant splashes and gouts of blood and the ultra-violent fight scenes in which the enfranchised Django kicks ass. One of the things that did my head in most was watching the two sides, the two faces combined. Specifically the very final scene, where everything is exactly right for a revenge epic, but Django's glasses are crooked. And I know it's on purpose. Nothing about this movie is unintentional, nothing is accidental, and the smallest things can, if you're paying attention to more than gunshots and explosions, knock your damn socks off. I think the actors and actresses in this movie deliver some of the most amazing, nuanced performances I've ever seen anywhere. The scenes with Samuel L Jackson were like watching someone walk barefoot on a knife edge; my stomach was twisting. Even the bit parts - the housemaids, the silent slaves in chains - are works of art, with layers of meaning and thought that go much deeper than anyone expects from a bit of violent fluff. My last thought: it's not a fair, ethical, moral movie, although it discusses fairness, ethics and morals in an interesting way (and by that I mean without once saying one word about any of those subjects. QT has absolutely mastered \"show, don't tell\" when it comes to his storytelling craft.) Django does some stuff for his own satisfaction and to further his goal that are pretty bad. His character is not pure, and you absolutely want to make excuses for those acts in your head, and that's amazing. (None of the characters are pure. None are simple. Not a single damn one of them.) If I could, I'd make this movie required watching in high school history classes.On re-reading this, when did I become a pretentious art-house movie critic? Watch the dang movie, it's kickass.",

            "content": "I have seen mostly high reviews for this movie, and I am in that crowd! To those with dissenting opinion obviously have not come to appreciate Mr. Tarantino's work. For this, I say that I feel sorry for them. The dialog is not overly intellectual, it is real human speak! As a whole Americans are nostalgic for Westerns, and are remorseful of what our nation found acceptable for many years(yes, slavery). But this movie was only using those themes as a backdrop to basic human emotions and actions. We want prosperity, to protect those we love, and want karma to work in our favor. However, there are times karma moves a bit too slowly, and that is where Tarantino finds his niche. Violence, banter, and victory (even if its not what the audience expects). This film delivers on all accounts. I am a Tarantino fan, and as such, I have to give this movie a 10. There were times the violence was mildly amusing, and others I had to peek through my fingers. Many of those who say its overkill (pun intended) are under the impression that events of the time were what we read out of our 6th grade history books. I feel that we are only given a glimpse of the horrific crimes that actually happened during that period. This is not a \"liberal\" movie. And while the Western angle may seem silly to some, it serves an ironic purpose to the subject matter.Lastly, I actually watched the Oscars this year because of the host who was \"too crass\", (my hat is off to you Mister MacFarlane), but I was so jacked to see that Christoph Waltz won an Oscar again. He was incredible as always, which only made me want to watch the movie even more. I was tickled as well to see some of Quentin's choices in supporting cast, being some well known people as well as bit players from his other films. Samuel L. Jackson made his appearance, and this was one film I wanted to punch him in the face! But he added a layer of hypocrisy to the film which speaks volumes to the real subject matter that was prevalent at the time.Laymen's review: I loved this movie!!!",

            "content": "'Django Unchained' is a story of earning freedom of a black slave with the help of a German bounty hunter and saving his loved one.The story became predictable when the legend of broomhilda was revealed. But Quentin Tarantino is known for his artistic and bloody twist in the story, and this movie is not different from that. As always in any Quentin Tarantino's movies, this movie contained a lot of blood work and ,in my opinion, unnecessary violence. But that is exactly why Quentin is known for. He has his own way of seeing a story and that is exactly why Quentin's work always draws our attention. Like it or hate it, Quentin will always get our attention and that's what good directors does.Another good thing about the movie is the acting of three gentlemen- Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. The rendition of Christoph as Dr. Schultz was as good as his rendition as 'Hans Landa' in 'Inglorious Basterds'. My Favorite part in the movie was the first sequence of the movie, where Dr. Schultz freed Django, though while watching it, i found a lot of similarities between this sequence and the opening sequence of 'Inglorious Basterds'. But it is true Christoph Waltz stole every scene which he was in with his incredible acting. I dare say, He alone made the movie as good as it is. It was good to see Leonardo DiCaprio playing a different type of character than his previous popular movies - Aviator, Shutter Island and Inception. In all of those three movies his characters were quite similar. His performance as Calvin Candie was very good, giving the character proper respect and importance. Last but not the least , Samuel L. Jackson. In my opinion, one of the most under-rated actor is Samuel L. Jackson. His rendition as Stephen was a good slap to to the face of the people who underrates him. He was fabulous in his acting, giving the right kind of antagonist this story required.There is nothing in the world that is absolute. As I mentioned before, The story was predictable when the legend of Broomhilda was revealed, and even with Quentin's best effort the story didn't get better. Also the over complexity in the rescue of the beloved Broomhilda made the film kind of bland than exciting. The unnecessary violent scenes didn't help either. The performance of Jamie Foxx as Django was good but not great. He was overshadowed by the characters played by Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. Violence and blood work doesn't necessarily bring grit to the film and this film proves it.In my opinion it is Quentin's one of the least impressive works.",

That's the place where Tarantino is happiest: out at the edge, playing with genre conventions, turning expectations inside out, ginning up the violence to exploitation-movie levels. The film is in two parts: the first half is a mock Western; the second is a mock-revenge melodrama about slavery, set in the deep South and ending in fountains of redemptive spurting blood. \"Django\" is a crap masterpiece, garrulous and repetitive, rich with jokes and cruelties, including some Old South cruelties that Tarantino invented for himself. It's a very strange movie, luridly sadistic and morally ambitious at the same time, and the audience is definitely alive to it, revelling in its incongruities, enjoying what's lusciously and profanely over the top.",

Django, on the other hand, is a pretty straightforward love/revenge story and the plot turns are surprisingly predictable which kills the suspense in a lot of the scenes.Nonetheless, the film would have been a very fun and violent romp, filled with colorful characters had it not been for one thing.. The editing. 180 minutes?? For LotR fine but this story did not warrant the run time. Instead its filled with plot meanderings and multi-minute clips simply of people walking in slow motion over rap music...

So, coming to the point, I may be wrong, I may have not understood a certain element of the movie, so please don't take my review too seriously. I did not enjoy the movie at all to begin with. There are a few factors that may have affected my liking, two prominent ones would be :- 1 :- As I mentioned, I have lost my patience with the never ending non- sense a lot of Indian movies show, including the Hero emerging victorious in a bloody gun-fight in spite of a million people trying to shoot him down which was the case with Django. 2 :- I just watched the epic Western 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly yesterday. The difference for me between a movie like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and Django is a sense of realism to the gun-wars and other aspects of the movie on the whole. Apart from that Clint Eastwood is just designed for those kind off movies. I dunno if that's the case with Jammie. Saying that, no denying he's a great actor, but you know may be that's just not his cup of tea. All in all, i kept waiting for a part where I could begin enjoying the movie, but no such point came for me unfortunately.

Similar in style and scope (violent movies that use satire, gore, comedy, and excitement with relish) about the evils of one aspect of society. But with this, it becomes much more interesting with the deeper involvement of characters. It's not without flaws though. The running time is frankly too long. Unnecessary. The film meddles in mediocre plot-lines for a while before the main conflict arises with the wife. And when the action comes, it comes almost out of nowhere and doesn't go away. Most of the earlier moments contain very little violence.But characterization is perfect. Every performance is excellent. Particular applause for Christopher Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio- their \"handshake\" scene was one of the most tense I've seen and their facades show the perfect signs of cracking. Masterful.Bottom line: it's enjoyable. As with Tarantino does, the bodies pile up and the gore may seem excessive.

This was cohesive. The entire cast was in it. The lead Jamie Foxx and his counterpart Christopher Waltz worked great together. Leonardo DiCaprio was....frighteningly excellent. It's very rare to have a film where the entire cast shows up to play oppose to a Cage/Statham I-Need-A-Paycheck movie. Even the smaller roles were approached with a fervor that properly articulates the intent and power this film possesses. Whether it be a testament to Quentin's ability to surprise even his biggest critics from time to time with a Grand Slam, or if it's a motivated cast wanting to make a film really resonate and mean something, I bought the Blu-Ray of this film. It's on Netflix, but I paid money anyway. This was a great watch, a film that showed both the darker aspects of humanity and that feeling of accomplishment when bravery and perseverance outlast and defeat ignorance and greed. I highly recommend this film. It isn't for Children. I say that knowing full well that sheltering children from our turbulent past doesn't particular aid in teaching them about it properly, but the violence, harsh language, brief nudity, and again violence probably isn't suitable to younger viewers. For adults who enjoy gritty period pieces, I recommend this. For adults who enjoy over-the-top Western Action, I recommend this.

Well it looks good, sounds good, hurts your face from smiling and leaves you with a feeling. That's a start. They talk like in a Tarantino movie. They revenge their pride like in a Tarantino movie. The actors are characters AND they have character. So far, so good. ~ violenhe? ~ What? ~ VIOLENCE!? ~ Of course. ~ Blood? ~ Yes. Yes.The story is not what I expected. Better. It was funny. It had a western theme, mainly because of the shooting. But also the music. It was well chosen of course, but also surprising at times. The dialog was smart, like clever, not well dressed. The language will offend some. Which is a good sign. Always. Remember the feelings? Good. Over all it was an enjoyable experience to watch this move. If you'll allow me to go a little academy judge in here: I think the movie is good on the merit of its ability to cause feelings to find their way to some parts of the body and mind that only some rare specimens of quality film can give you.

            "content": "Review of Django (the \"D\" is silent)Well, Django is certainly a Tarantino movie, but in my opinion, it is also one of his finest works (behind Pulp fiction, of course). Although I have to admit, sometimes the jury still seems to be out on Tarantino's style; this movie makes a definite case in his favor. Nevertheless, the story is one that is both timeless and novel at the same time. Classic man seeking lost love, but this man happens to be s freed slave bounty hunter, killin all the white folks that are deservin' of a killin' with the help of his German friend and benefactor. Beyond the story, however, Tarantino also solidifies his role as the modern epic storyteller sparing none of the gory, boring, long, beautifully shot details. Somehow it all works. The modern western epic is here to stay with Django (and eventually Hateful 8). Is Django perfect? No. If it was perfect would it truly be a Tarantino film? Again, I say no. Much like the Japanese principle of wabi-sabi, this film has a certain something that isn't quite right, but makes it oh, so memorable (although some-times maybe just a tad too memorable). But here I think there is the right amount (give or take a liter of blood) of Tarantino uniqueness without being totally overboard. Is it a life changing drama covering unspoken hot-button transcendental subjects; well, yes and no; in a Tarantino sort of way. In summary, it is long, but it moves and is, quite plainly, a good movieAnother thing that really pulls this movie together is the acting. Tarantino as usual, formulates the perfect balance between strange and just plain talented actors and actresses A wonderful amount of convincing acting comes from Mr. Foxx. Mr. Jackson is as talented as ever (perhaps too good) as the cranky old slave. Oh, and did I mention Leonardo Di Caprio\u0085 enough said. In short, the story combined with the incredible acting make a worthy flickWhat really seals the deal, however, is the incredible cinematography. Tarantino really finds himself at home in the incredible vistas of the near-west and south in antebellum America. I hope that you are able to find yourself in an IMAX for this bad boy. I think that this is really what licks the envelope for me. It should be noted that this doesn't rid the movie of the necessary Tarantinoisms. Story, talent, and technically beautiful. And as an extra add on Tarantino's choice in soundtrack is as eclectic and oddly appropriate as ever. I will give this movie the solid \"really should see (aka 8.5/10). Enjoy.",

Foxx is likable enough as Django but he easily overshadowed by the AMAZING Waltz who deserved every accolade awarded.

One goes for the KO straight away as the other sardonically submits to him, leading to one heck of a masterful, albeit violent, conclusion between parties.160 minutes felt overly long at times and I thought 2 hours was enough at times. Some scenes felt unnecessary long while some scenes were just excellent fun along with the music that jumps from Western hymns to big bass rap. I would recommend anyone to check this out solely for the laughs the raid scene gave me. The dialogue could not have been better and every bit player, whether with a few words or a few sentences, kept me chuckling over and over. This is a good film I may or may not watch again.

They do all the killing and never get hurt. Django constantly runs his mouth to all the white people and they smart off to him but never hurt him. Also the N word starts to make you wince because it is just said in almost ever sentence. I totally understand Tarantino putting it in the movie since it was used back then but you start to get the since that he secretly loves it. I read somewhere that it was used 110 times. Towards the End: Leo's character just dragged on and on. It could have been cut down a lot. I thought that he was going to be this horrible monster and doing something so incredibly disgusting to Django and King when he found out about their lies, I thought I was going to have to close my eyes, but to my boring surprise Leo's character just asks them to keep their promise of $12,000 and they could have the girl. In my head I was like \"wan wan\" anticlimax much? Ending: I was glad Django had a little bit of a problem getting free and was caught so at least there was some \"oh no i wonder what's going to happen\" instead of \"oh hey django just up and killed all of those bad guys without a problem\" like earlier in the movie.

            "content": "Author: Robert D. Ruplenas/Russell V. Porter15 June 1999/July 2013It is, in a way, depressing to watch Lawrence of Arabia today. One winds up contrasting it with the sort of technologically slick and aesthetically shallow spectacles, like \"Titanic\", that garner the sort of adulation that a truly great movie like \"Lawrence\" received in its day, and one realizes how far we have fallen.Ignore David Lean's painterly technique, the way he fills the screen like a canvas. Ignore Freddie Young's stunning cinematography in fulfillment of Lean's vision. Ignore the fabulous score by Maurice Jarre. Ignore the stupendous cast. Ignore the topnotch script.What we have, beyond all this, is an absolutely gripping and psychologically perplexing character study of a uniquely enigmatic individual that keeps us on the edge of our seats for the full length of the movie. \"Lawrence\", at over 200 minutes, goes by faster than many a movie of half its length, due to Lean's brilliant pacing and direction, and superb acting all around. To make a comparison in the world of music, this movie, like Mahler's 8th symphony, is a universe contained within itself.Of course, it is an exercise in self-denial and philistinism to watch this movie in anything other than the wide-screen - or \"letterbox\" - format, due to Lean's complete use of every inch of the wide screen. To watch it otherwise is to miss half of Lean's intention.To use a hackneyed phrase, they simply don't make 'em like this anymore... but then along comes Django Unchained. As a movie themed in the time of slavery this one is just striking as one that truly does justice as an unearthing of that golden time with that operatic quality with unforgettable characters and a larger than life story as a movie that was supposed to have been made in that time but wasn't, and when it comes to the anachronistic music, the only explanation that can be given is that Quentin has a gift for taking the most unlikely music and making it work like the perfect puzzle piece [(like a parallel universe where that kind of music was actually common back then if you will) Particularly the use of Tupac while he's mowing down racist scumbags, just the action accompanied by the message in the lyrics just made it true cinematic poetry].",

It seems to me that it is in fact yet another bullshit excuse to portray spectacular killings for numb-minded viewers who can only expect this from a movie. Nothing makes sense in this movie, absolutely nothing. And it is the same as all the last Tarantino babies. It is better then kill bill and Inglorious Bastards, but what isn't?

This movie, however, is probably the only exception in the world to that statement.First off, Jamie Foxx is \"alright\". I can only watch him play the same character so many times before enough is enough. Samuel L. Jackson is pretty hysterical and Leonardo DiCaprio is really captivating-especially improvising and continuing when truly hurting himself (see TRIVIA for further details). Surprisingly, I thought he fit the role pretty well. He was way more believable than I thought he would be.The real jewel of this film is Christoph Waltz. Without gushing too much, I will say this is one of the most outstanding performances of any actor in any role, ever. I was very pleased he won the Golden Globe for best supporting actor (although I considered him the lead). No one else deserved it more than he.The writing/story is Quentin Tarantino's doing, so expect a lot of blood, a lot of action, and a lot of unexpected laughs.Brilliant film, and I hate westerns.

While I am an avid western fan (and maybe biased in that respect), I still believe this would be a great choice for almost any film-loving adult with the desire to be entertained.I have to say though, I was skeptical going into this one, simply because I wasn't sure if Jamie Foxx could pull off a true cowboy role. But boy was I wrong. I honestly never thought we'd see a brand new, original, rugged and tough, slightly sarcastic at times, and mostly quiet, loner cowboy just like the timeless old spaghetti westerns. But being as Tarantino is such a fan of Sergio Leone classics like the Dollars trilogy, and other great films, I guess I should have known better. Needless to say, Foxx pulled it off like no other, and I sincerely hope there are sequels.Also, Christoph Waltz may just be one of the most talented actors in our time. If you enjoyed his menacing performance in \"Inglorious Basterds\", then you will be far from disappointed with him in Django Unchained. Leonardo DiCaprio aced his part by playing one of the most evil antagonists I have seen in a long while. His performance was perfect, and truly convincing.Anyway, this is a great flick and I hope people enjoy it as much I do.",

I have to say I enjoyed watching it.That being said, this film is a montage of previous westerns.

He plays the leading protagonist very well. He is overshadowed by Christoph Waltz's character frequently throughout the movie. To me, Christoph Waltz's character is very charming in order to distract viewers, and his heroism and his humor make American viewers less uncomfortable with the subject matter because TV about U.S. slavery does that a lot. But a bit more than halfway through the movie, Django really comes into his own and he turns from student to full-on hero. My favorite scene might be the scene that Quenten Tarantino makes an appearance in. Kerry Washington's character was the absolute perfect damsel and she was tough and she never broke down and I loved hearing her speak German, but I wish that she had more to do. There was a minor character, Sheba, that I was pretty curious about but they didn't show her much or explain her story. And Walton Goggins was great, per usual. It's worth watching, but I saw it with a very squeamish person, so be careful -- there's a bloodbath or two. Also, the music was outstanding!

It had a fantastic nostalgic soundtrack that brought back epic memories of 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly' which created a warm retro western atmosphere. The performances were all good; especially Samuel L Jackson! Usually he plays a similar character but here he looked and acted brilliantly. Like all Tarantino films, there is a lot of violence in Django but it is handled very well. There are two types of violence seen in the film. There was the serious violence that is often seen in regards to the disgusting way the slaves were treated. It was disturbing, harrowing and realistic which helped convey the serious messages of the film. And then there was the Tarantino violence. Over the top and unrealistic but fun and often comedic, this violence was always enjoyable and was used in the right moments. You would think including such different types of violence would confuse the tone and come across as inappropriate, like I thought Inglorious Basterds was, but somehow it worked brilliantly! The best scene in the film for me was the last scene. I won't spoil it; but I will say that it left me with a tear in my eye!

In exchange for his freedom and $75, Django helps Schultz collect a bounty on three outlaws that Django is familiar with.

That being said, there are some scenes that feel a little out of place. A scene featuring Jonah Hill as Bag Man #2 adds some comedic value but seems disconnected from the feel of the majority of the movie. Perhaps some of these differences can be attributed to Django Unchained being the first feature film directed by Tarantino that was not edited by Sally Menke, who passed away in 2010. Fortunately the acting throughout is top notch. DiCaprio convincingly takes on the role of a villain giving the audience a character that is all too easy to love-to-hate. In one scene, DiCaprio's hand is cut while filming but he remains in character and that is the take that was used. Jamie Foxx starts a little slow but gains momentum as the film progresses, eventually playing the role of Django like it was written for him. Waltz also puts in a strong performance with good on screen chemistry with Foxx.The movie has its hiccups but delivers a film that is full of new surprises mixed with homages to a genre of film that we see so rarely in present times. Franco Nero makes a cameo approving this new take on his old character. In that spirit, I approve this new take on a classic genre film.",

I do not deny that, the first hour of the movie, I did enjoy because of the witty and funny and smart conversations, but the last 2 hours was becoming more and more unbearable. That's why I said 'just' TWO most wasted hours.I came to see it, with an expectation of a violent movie (as I was well aware by the name of the director)yet containing some humanity or at least some morale in it. Because come on, it won 2 Oscars and one of that is for best writing. But NO, I waited and waited until the end of the movie, and all I saw was just a man who ruthlessly kills people, no matter who they are, as long as they are white. And a man that just because of a woman, heartlessly stand outside watching other human get ripped off. I didn't even mention the loophole of logic throughout the movie. The music is ridiculous somewhere, it reminds me of some Chinese songs but on a cowboy-themed movie. Fair enough, 2 years before the civil war, we get rap and hip-hop in that too. I think it's fair enough for Christoph Waltz to win an Oscar for supporting role. He did a good job, and was a very major factor that brought me the first enjoyable hour. And then it just went from bad to worse. The whole film.I left after the ending with a big question in my head: How the hell does this film get an award for writing screen while all it's about is killing killing killing no matter what morale and reason? Or am I too naive or too shallow to understand any hidden humanity meaning in the film?",

His fluent and unbelievably original dialog just makes me smile. I've always admired his originality and unwavering style that has been heavily criticized and praised but he continuously puts his heart and soul into what he knows is a fine movie. What I especially love about Django and all of Tarantino's film is his perfectly placed music. Nothing can make or break a movie more than a song. Tarantino makes his actors into Gods with the music he places in his movies. During the epic gun fight at Candieland 2pac's \"Unchained\" plays while Django shoots up the joint in slow motion and you vision him as a superhero. He is the coolest cat because of that song. I highly recommend this film to movie-goers. Django will make you hold your breath and laugh until it hurts and that is why Quentin Tarantino deserves outstanding recognition for this amazing milestone in cinema!",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's 8th film \"Django Unchained\" is one hell of a movie. A brutal, bloody, terrifying, hilarious and awe-inspiring western disguised as a buddy movie that is so great that if John Wayne and Sergio Leone were alive now, they would've approve of this movie. It's designed to shock you, polarize you, test you and maybe even surprise you. But let me clear on this: If you are not a fan of bloody violence and the running length of 165 minutes, see a shorter movie. But if you love to see what Tarantino can do with movies like this, then you're in for a treat. Set during slavery in 1858, the movie follows Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (The always reliable Christoph Waltz) who hires him as a bounty hunter and a free man to find the Brittle Brothers. After finding them and hunting them down at a plantation run by Big Daddy (a remarkable Don Johnson), they relax for the winter only for them to go on a mission to find and rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who runs a plantation known as Candieland. He even has a renegade slave as a servant named Stephen (A nearly recognizable Samuel L. Jackson, hidden in makeup and some prosthetics), who will have a part to play in the last half of the movie. I think Quentin Tarantino has outdone himself once again. Being in the filmmaking game for 20 years now, you can't deny and even reject his style in what he is bringing to the screen (He also has a cameo in here as well). His dialog is like reading a book that grabs you and makes you want to know what happens next. The look and scope of the film is magnificent, thanks to a brilliant Oscar- winning cinematographer Robert Richardson and the late production designer J. Michael Riva. The performances in this film are brilliant. Having won an Oscar for \"Ray\", Jamie Foxx continues with his breathtaking performances that wows us. Here as Django, he is certainly fearless, baring his soul (and body) playing a man who is free from slavery, but can't be free by the rules and limitations of slavery",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino creates another effective and popular film with his unconventional twist on historical events with the release of, Django Unchained. The style from his Nazi Germany film, Inglorious Bastards, pours right into Django Unchained. Only this time, he seems to kick it up a notch with an over the top, western-type violence filled spectacle where race is enticed and blood is spilled- both in very excessive amounts. Django Unchained is an envelope pushing masterpiece- with it's overdone exploitation of racial inequalities and amazing dialogue, while adding random spurts of humor.This begins almost immediately with close-up shots of the whip-marked backs of a chain gang of slaves being marched across Texas. Among them is Django (Jamie Foxx), whose fate soon changes with the arrival of Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz), a German dentist turned merciless bounty hunter who promises Django's freedom to help him track down three plantation foremen whose identities he needs Django(who has suffered at their hands)to confirm.On their journey, Tarantino really hammers home the western twist with bullets flying, explosives, and the old typical western-color camera scenes and noises. Tarantino overuses the \"n-word,\" but this film portrayed it very effective due to the taboo of the word and unexpectedness. During their adventures, Schultz learns Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) is owned by ruthless plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), whose favorite hobby is \"Mandingo fighting\" -watching slaves fight to the death for sport. Knowing Candie won't just give up Broomhilda, the two head to the typical giant southern plantation, Candyland. Their plan soon unfolds into a bloodbath fight with a funny dramatization of a guy that Django uses as a human shield who just won't die.The acting was nothing short of amazing. His cast keeps an eye on Tarantino's smooth dialogue approach. Foxx is terrific in a role requiring brawn and brains, rank and humor. The exceptional Waltz, wearing a Texas-sized beard, cleverly rolls his accent around Tarantino's dialogue perfectly. DiCaprio is as evenly strong as a stylish fiend whose repulsive features include a boyish enthusiasm for evil. Samuel L. Jackson has an even more daring role: Candie's obedient butler/servant, who listens as Candie holds a dead slave's skull and rambles on about a slave's small mental capacity, then sips brandy with him, a complete participant in the inhumanity.Is Tarantino telling us much about slavery that we don't know? I think his message is bigger than that. He's pushing the film industry to places it has never been. There is no way a viewer could walk out of Django Unchained and not feel something: anger, outrage, amusement, satisfaction. I am excited to see where Quentin goes from here.",

Don't go into Django thinking it's an \"Oscar Movie\" that has a serious chance at Best Picture. Go into it like you would go into any other Tarantino movie, because you simply want to be entertained for 2.5 hours.From the opening credits to the closing ones it's clear this is a very \"Tarantino\" movie and fanboys of the man will have plenty to be excited about. The obvious homages to Sergio Leone (whom Tarantino has stated one multiple occasions is his favorite director ever), the standoffs that always seem to end differently than you predict, the hilarious and ironic use of music, and of course the dialogue. There's at least 2-3 classic Tarantino monologues in Django Unchained.But how does the movie play for those of us like Tarantino but don't salivate every time his name is mentioned? The answer is very well. While this doesn't have the huge ensemble cast of characters we're used to from a QT movie, the 4-5 main ones provide plenty of meat for us to chew on. My biggest complaint about its that the two best characters (DiCaprio's Plantation Owner and Samuel L. Jackson's whatever you call it) don't really appear until the 3rd act.But the dynamic between the two lead turns, Jaime Foxx as Django and Christoph Waltz as a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist, is plenty to carry the majority of the movie. Much like Waltz's Oscar-Winning turn in \"Inglorious Basterds\" he brings an element of comedy to the table but you also know he always has a trick up his sleeve. You feel like something crazy is going to happen every time he's on screen, and usually it does.There's a point in the 2nd act when the movie drags a bit when it's transitioning between the first conflict (which is solved surprisingly quick) and the second one. But even when it slows down the performances of Waltz and Foxx along with feeling that you're surely headed for a classic Tarantino bloodbath is enough to keep it watchable.Django Unchained goes from good to great once DiCaprio and Jackson pop up. From their first scenes it feels like this revenge story could explode at any moment. And eventually it does. We see the biggest and most over-the-top bloodbath of Tarantino's career (which is saying a lot) and I have no complaints about that. Maybe the movie ran 20 minutes too long but once you get to the end it won't matter because you truly will care about what happens to Django.Django Unchained is not a perfect movie. It was probably 20-30 minutes too long. The middle dragged. It also seemed a little far-fetched for even a Tarantino movie. But none of that can take away from the fact that if you can stomach the blood, thematic elements, and language, then Django Unchained is perhaps the most fun you'll have at the movies all year. Chalk another classic up to QT's already impressive filmography.",

The way the story unfolds is like an epic opera, which I view in parallel to how masterpieces like Apocalypse Now would unfold; all while it captures how rough and dreadful the era was of slavery.

Django tries desperately to reinvent the charismatic, witty characters of Inglorious Basterds, but unlike Inglorious Basterds, we find merely a shallow, logorrheic bunch of show-offs.

            "content": "Excellent Movie; Tarantino's quality captivates the audience once againPulp Fiction (1994), Inglorious Basterds (2009), and now Django Unchained (2012), Quentin Tarantino has persisted on his unique style and put together another trademark masterpiece. A movie portrayed in 1964, shortly before the Civil War of the United States, Django (Jamie Foxx), a former slave, embarks on an exhilarating journey to find his missing wife Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington). Together with his emancipator Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), they eventually enter a traditional southern plantation field, known as \"Candyland,\" owned by \"Mandingo-fighting\" aficionado Calvin Candie (Leonardo Di Caprio). Django and Dr. Shultz create a plan to acquire Hilda, by first buying one of Candie's \"Mandingo fighters,\" and subtly add Hilda to their $12'000 bill. Their plan hits a major setback as Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), a privileged slave that represses his own race, notices their clever strategy. Intended towards a Western- loving audience, this film depicts heart-pounding gunfights that although graphic, exemplify Tarantino's stunning filmmaking panache. A key aspect, that made this film a success, was how it used contemporary music and was able to adapt it to a film based on the 19th century. Soundtracks such \"100 Black Coffins\" by American rapper Rick Ross, and John Legend's \"Who did that to you?\" were the some of the songs used in Tarantino's varied play list. Although the songs and movie are dissimilar in time period, the blend produced between these two elements is efficient and inimitable. One of the major subjects presented in this movie, is how African- American were treated before the Civil War. Racially abused, and discriminated merely by their skin color, this topic was controversially displayed in Quentin Tarantino's film. Unfortunately this was the harsh truth of the years that anticipated the Civil War, and on a personal note, I'm frankly glad that discrimination is oppressed, and equality has been pursued throughout the latter decades of the 20th century. Although the following comparison includes films that differentiate highly in genre, time period, action, and mood there are some major comparisons and contrasts that emerge from both \"Django Unchained\" and Tate Taylor's Oscar winning success \"The Help\" (2011), in terms of the display of discrimination. One of the differences is of course, the time period. \"Django Unchained,\" as previously mentioned, is displayed during the ardent years before the Civil War where racism was fiercely denoted by the use of certain words and suggestive actions (which I will not specify). Meanwhile \"The Help\" is presented to us during the 1960's, where the Civil Rights Movement was gaining momentum, and reaching its defining stages. Racism was not as harshly displayed in this movie compared to Django Unchained, but it was still one of the fundamental subjects in the movie. Second, \"Django Unchained\" is presented to us in a more \"male\" point of view. Django, who is of course the protagonist, was surrounded by the unpleasant realities of men who were discriminated. In various occasions, even Django, took advantage of his freedom, and discriminated his own race. \"The Help,\" displays the life of African Americans, from a female point of view, where two housemaids experience the everyday injustice of life during the mid stages of the 20th century in the United States. A third and final difference is the tone of the film. Tarantino's film has an unusual blend of satire and seriousness covering almost every theme/topic of the movie. Even during the gunfights there is mockery and a satiric mood during vital scenes of the film. For example, when Django kills Stephen, the protagonist first shoots his counterparts knees, and as Stephen falls to the ground Django prepares some dynamite. When he leaves the house, Django smiles and subsequently the house blows up. Django's wife is then clapping her hands as if she just watched an elementary school play. \"The Help\" occasionally presents itself with a satire mood, but in key events of the movie seriousness is heavily displayed, as emotions become the main concentration of the film. This is done, so that the audience can sync in a more realistic idea of how things were during the Civil Rights Movement. I loved this movie, its tweak of satire tenor together with its mouth-watering action, makes this film one of my all time favorites, deservedly earning a 9/10. This film really captures the U.S during the 1800's, and frankly makes me happy of how things have changed throughout history. Demonstrating the social injustice and racial abuse that marked the years before the Civil War, this made me think of how lucky we are to live in a society that oppresses discrimination, and shows respect towards all races. We are all human beings and we all deserve the same amount of respect. It's true that Tarantino may divulge very controversial scenes, illustrating blood and gore, racism, and an excess of sexual flashes, but there is always a lesson deep down inside that he wants us to comprehend. This film was nominated for 5 different Oscar categories during the 85th Academy Awards. It was a nominee for best motion picture of the year, which was obtained by Ben Affleck's \"Argo\" (2012). It also finished as a nominee for best achievement in sound editing and best achievement in cinematography. \"Django Unchained\" did become one of the six multiple-winning films, as it obtained two triumphs for Christop Waltz performance as a supporting actor and Quentin Tarantino's writing/screenplay. Overall, I believe that this movie is simply a success, Tarantino's work has done a fantastic job since the beginning of his career. This movie shows that Tarantino hasn't only maintained his status amongst the elite, but that he has progressed even more, throughout his phenomenal development as a director.

Tarantino's first western shows us that he can really take on anything as he delivers a film better than any other western out there, even competing with the big dogs like 'The Good The Bad And The Ugly'. I think this modernized western is a decade defining film for sure and will be one of the best directed, perfectly executed films for many years to come. There is very very little that could be changed at all in this film. The film starts and we are immediately thrown into the concept of slavery as we follow a 'pack' of slaves through a desolate land. Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx) is a typical slave who turns out not so typical when he is granted his freedom in exchange for helping Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) with some bounty hunting business. From then on, a bond is forged between the two unlikely friends as they go on a dangerous yet thrilling mission to free Django's slave wife from the most treacherous slave hating maniac of a plantation owner you will ever meet, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). The atmosphere changes throughout this movie a lot, but the same continuous light-hearted vibe is evident as each scene is either fun, action packed or just plain hilarious! You are just glued to the screen because each and every scene is different as we meet new characters as the story progresses. There is however, as in most films, a standout scene. If you have seen this film or are planning on watching it you will know the scene I'm talking about once the movie has finished. The goriest, over the top, and not to mention best shootout you will ever witness in any film. As in true Tarantino fashion the gore is on point, being over the top and just crazy. Django tears up the house shooting fumbling idiots one by one, painting the walls red literally. Each shot adds to the explosive bloodbath that you can't help but revel in. The completely unique and unusual music kicks in as the bullets begin to fly, I mean what director would think to put a rap song with a western shootout and still make it work astoundingly? Some beautiful cinematography from inside the house, and of seemingly hundreds of armed men running into the house and getting mowed down by a rain of bullets. That scene will stick with me forever as one of my unconventional favourites. My favourite character in this film, despite my favourite actor being Christoph Waltz has to be Stephen played by the great Samuel L Jackson. When you think of Samuel L Jackson, instantly the smooth talking Jules Winnfield comes to mind from Quentin's second film Pulp Fiction, but his character in this film is completely different in every way. Stephen is an old decrepit Slave who has become so old he doesn't really act like a slave anymore; Calvin Candie is more lenient to his character and even jokes around with Stephen. Being his slave for such a long time they have become friends which is pleasantly unusual. He is smarter than he looks or acts as he sees through Django's plan to free his wife. Watching Samuel act in this film is just so satisfying, he can really inhabit a character and it just seems like Stephen is the character who Samuel was not meant to play but he does it so perfectly. As for a rating, there is basically nothing I would change; anything I could possibly think of would only be me choosing something for the sake of choosing it as everything is perfect. Having said that, I would have to give this film 10/10 as it is one of the best I've ever seen. The story is amazing, the scene's vary so much making this film not the slightest bit boring and pretty much everything else makes the film even better including an incredible soundtrack, outstanding acting and stunning cinematography. I would say there is no way any Tarantino film could top this, but knowing him there is a very big change it could happen as I said the very same thing to Kill Bill and look where we are now. You will be captivated from scene one, right up until the climactic quarter of the film, yes that's right, there is literally a quarter of the film that is the penultimate part of the film!If you haven't seen this film already I can't recommend it enough, whatever type of films you are into I can almost guarantee you will like it, there is something for everyone. Everything is varied so there is always something new on screen that will keep you enticed. If you're looking for a cinematic masterpiece, or just a good time, then this is the film for you as it will keep you on the edge of your seat but then you will be blown you away as it smashes boundaries and is ultimately a good movie! 10/10 \u2013 A cinematic landmark.",

(having found out that Stephen had knee problems that handicapped him) he then turned the dynamites on and walked out of the house while the camera focuses on the beautiful Hildi as Django gives his last glance at the house before it exploded. the last scene shows Django and Hildi riding their horses together to the woods.GREAT MOVIE, A DEFINITE MUST-WATCH although they said the N word countless times.",

            "content": "Today is the 6th of Jan. 2013. The current average IMDb score for this movie is 8.8 and it is over rated.Foxx's performance was wonderful and he is the one who pulls the movie up and makes it work. The blood, explosions and violence in the movie are exaggerated in a cartoony way which makes it watching easier. The main problem with this movie is that it has spoilers inbuilt in it throughout the whole movie. Therefore throughout the whole movie I could see a step ahead, and this is why -1. I will start with Waltz's performance, it is magnificent but the character is not original. It is watching Col. Landa all over again. He is charismatic, funny and surprises you. However since it is exactly how he behaved in previous movies none of the surprises that come from him does not actually surprise you because you expect these surprises. 2. Samuel L. Jackson makes an interesting appearance, but again he always plays a bad S.O.B. and this movie is not exception. Which makes it predictable. 3. Tarantino makes an appearance and when you see Tarantino in a Tarantino movie you just know how long it will last and how it will end.There is a short comic relief scene with Jonah Hill, which takes the movie to a totally different direction and makes it sound like a cheesy comedy. This totally ripped me apart from the movie.Technical things that just did not work - The movie uses green screen for some scenes mostly to add/modify nature but they were not properly done, thus ruining the movie experience. The \"old person\" make up that was used for Samuel. L . Jackson in some shoots was not properly done which resulted in his face shining like a disco ball. All in all this is a great a movie but it is not the best of Tarantino. A strong 7.5 (since IMDb system does not support fractions I gave it 8).",

Scenes are breathtaking at times and when their not, it is funny and interesting and it contains brutal Tarantino violence. This is a film about slavery and shows a lot of shocking images about an awful history, but don't forget that this is an action adventure and not a Schindlers list (like Tarantino also said in one of he's interviews) This is he's own perspective for a good spaghetti-western with he's own sauce and you can see he loved working on this.

Unfortunately, the script for this Western is so long and goes on and on that the repellent violence can't be ignored. The film actually gets off to a fairly engaging start, thanks to a brilliant performance from Waltz as dentist/bounty hunter. Foxx is much less interesting as Django, a perpetually angry and arrogant slave. But the performance of DiCaprio was not convincing as an evil slave owner.

            "content": "I was really excited to see 'Django Unchained,' knowing it was a Tarantino movie and all. My all-time favorite movie is Pulp Fiction, and upon reading that this movie may one day even rival such a masterpiece for the title of Tarantino's best work, I got REALLY excited. However, it turned out to be blasphemy. I felt that Tarantino simply indulges too much in 'Django.' The movie is about an angry black guy killing while people, and I just think there are too many scenes where Tarantino wants to please himself and the audience, show them what they want to see. The story isn't inventive enough and, for me, the movie tries to make up for its shortcomings in this aspect with exaggerated duration and great music. Yeah, I really liked the music, even the rap bits, but the movie is unnecessarily long. After being underwhelmed by it, I heard positive reactions mostly going in the way of 'there's a little bit of everything.' And there is. There's intelligence, humor, violence, blood, and conversations that at best only remind us of 'Pulp Fiction.' And there's a whole lot of scenes that are there just for the viewer's pleasure. In my opinion, throwing a little bit of everything into the mix doesn't make for a great movie. Who wants to hear good music will likely download the OST after watching this. Who wants to see gore will have his fill, and those that want to have a laugh will have a better time than watching most of the sitcoms that are on offer today. But when everything is said and done, this doesn't come anywhere near Tarantino's best. Now, about the cast. I thought Di Caprio is the best in this movie, for me he outshines Jackson, Foxx and Waltz. They all do a good job, but Di Caprio took it up a notch, and Jackson delivers a beautiful performance as well. Basically, the movie really steps it up once those two are in the picture. Also, it was nice to see The Shield's Walton Goggins co- star. Bottom line is, this is some cast we have here and some great performances.You will get your money's worth with this one and you'll have some fun, but don't expect an all-time great that will blow you away.",

            "content": "i am relatively new to western cinema compared to all the users here, but i have a few favorite directors who never seem to fail to live up to expectations, and one of them is Quentin Tarantino. The best thing about him is his writing which is so creative, the characters in his movies are very intriguing and more intriguing are the situations that he puts his characters into. Dialogues in his movies are always great and memorable. Another commendable thing is the casting and performances of each actor. I can just go on and on...Django Unchained is not short on any of these aspects. Every aspect of the movie was top class. Individually and collaboratively all the 4 lead actors were brilliant. It is shocking that DiCaprio hasn't won an Oscar yet and more shocking is that he hasn't been nominated for his role in this movie. He stole the show in every scene he was in. Christoph Waltz was mesmerizing as Dr. Schultz, a bounty hunter. Jamie Foxx was incredible as Django a black slave who transformed into an unforgiving revenge machine. Samuel L. Jackson as Steven had a small role but nonetheless he did complete justice to it you cannot imagine anyone else who could have played this role better than he did.Some people complain about the violence in the movie, all i can say is, Tarantino movies wouldn't be the same without it. So the people who think its too much should stop being so serious and enjoy the movie.It was the first time i saw a Tarantino movie on the big screen and oh my, what an experience! I enjoyed every bit of it.

            "content": "Some say he is a copier. Some (myself included) say that he is a talented, brilliant genius. Whatever you think about Quentin Tarantino, you can rarely get away with having apathetic reaction to his style and work. His latest effort, \"Django Unchained,\" is no exception. This time, the much-debated filmmaker depicts the topic that most present-day Americans would prefer to forget and erase out of their country's history - slavery. The movie is set in the Deep South, just a couple of years before the spark of the Civil War.Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a former dentist and now a full-time bounty hunter, crosses the South in search of a notorious gang, the Brittle Brothers. Having no idea what the brothers look like, he finds a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), who is able to identify them and has some personal business with them. Schultz \"purchases\" Django and agrees to free him if he helps him in tracking down the outlaws. During that time, the former slave gets some practice in \"the bounty-hunting business\", as the doctor trains him for a \"deputy\". After a fortuitous turn of events, the Brittle Brothers are brought to justice (in Tarantino's way, of course). Django, being a free man, plans to rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), whom he has lost during an auction. Along with Schultz, he embarks on a quest to free the woman he loves from the hands of infamous Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a powerful plantation owner. As the two bounty hunters, under false pretext, visit the plantation Candyland, they provoke the suspicions of Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), Candie's trusted and most-privileged slave... Will they make it out alive and with Broomhilda before it's too late? From the very beginning, we are treated with features that Tarantino's films offer. The great landscapes, music, performances, witty dialogues and large amounts of \"red paint\".The visuals are amazing, from a Texan landscapes that open the movie to the views of Candyland. Robert Richardson, Tarantino's cinematographer, who previously worked with him on \"Inglourious Basterds\" and both volumes of \"Kill Bill\", has outdone himself again. Every scene looks beautiful and gives off the proper atmosphere of the late 1850s of the American South.One of the greatest things about Tarantino's movies is his music choice. As the opening credits roll over the opening scene of the chained slaves led by two slave drivers, the original \"Django\" theme is heard. There are also some masterpieces from Ennio Morricone (including \"Ancora Qui\", written by the maestro specially for the film), and other artists who worked on movie scores in the past. We also get to hear a couple of modern song, for instance \"Who Did That to You?\", performed by John Legend and written for the film itself, and the mix of James Brown's \"Payback\" and 2-Pac's \"Untouchable.\" Despite the fact that the film takes place in the late 1850s, Tarantino manages for these pieces not to be out of place and go perfectly with his film and his vision.Regarding the performances, Christoph Waltz is a show stealer, as he was in \"Inglourious Basterds,\" in which he portrayed the most likable villain in the cinematic history, Colonel Hans Landa of the SS. Here, his performance is by no means worse. He seems to be a man who perfectly understands Tarantino and his style of writing and has the ability to bring it up in viewer's eyes even more. Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as a clever house slave. His characterization makes him hardly recognizable, and his acting as Stephen is possibly even better than the one of his Jules from \"Pulp Fiction\". Then, there is Leonardo DiCaprio, playing a role that he has not played that often. In this film, he goes away from the image of a lover boy to portray a brutal, sadistic and evil \"businessman.\" His transformation is great and so is his acting. If any of you, ladies, are still in love with Jack from \"Titanic\", do yourselves a favor - watch this movie, change your mind and start looking for another boyfriend.In this instance (as always), despite the fact that the movie deals with a serious and very controversial topic, Tarantino manages to let in a substantial dose of humor. Throughout, there are some of the most comical sequences that the filmmaker has ever put into his work. Considering all of them (including the hilarious \"early KKK\" scene), I would say that \"Django Unchained\" may be Tarantino's funniest movie yet.Despite the running time of 165 minutes, while watching the movie, you will never glance at your watch - you will care too much about what is happening on the screen. It's all here - action scenes, a large amount of suspense and brilliant writing (which, in Tarantino's case, is as good as, if not better than, the action), and even a love story (which is not often a major part of Tarantino's works). There is enough to make everyone happy, despite things that may make you feel uncomfortable, such as racism and the cruelty of slavery as portrayed. Consequently, as Candie remarks in the film, \"Adult supervision is required.\" This is a Quentin Tarantino film in the phrase's full meaning.",

Schultz explains that he is no longer a dentist but now a bounty hunter and that if Django helps him he will give him his freedom, 75 dollars, and his own horse. After Django immediately agrees to the terms, Schultz shows he is a bounty hunter by proving to the town that their sheriff is an outlaw and had a bounty over his head.Django and Schultz make up a plan to have Django act as his valet. They arrive at \"Big Daddy's\" plantation asking to buy one of his many slave girls for an outrageous price. While Schultz consults \"Big Daddy\", Django is given free roam around the plantation to find the Brittle brothers. He shoots one dead on the spot, whips the other till unconscious, shoots him, and Schultz kills the last brother with a sniper rifle. Once this is done Schultz asks what Django will do now and he replies that he will try and find his wife Brunhilde. Schultz decides to help Django retrieve his wife from Calvin Candie's 'Candie Land'. When they both arrive and try and make it seem like they are interested in buying one of Calvin's mandigo fighters, one of Calvin's house slaves indicate that those are not their real intentions. When this is realized a huge gun fight in Calvin's house breaks out, and although Schultz is killed in this, Django kills many but is captured once he runs out of bullets and is out numbered. Once Django escapes his capturing and returns to 'Candie Land' to rescue his wife, he kills every last survivor and blows up the house in the process.Review Tarantino films do have an immense amount of killing but that is the not the only focus that he brings to the movie screen.Throughout the movie, there are many occurrences where the audience is caught laughing and the movie is no longer strictly serious. One scene in particular that is put in to give some comedic relief is when \"Big Daddy\" sends a group of men to go kill Schultz and Django. During this scene the group of men argue to each other about lack of sight when wearing the bags on their heads and whose fault it is. This scene in particular makes it seem like it is more of a comedic movie rather than a serious one. Even a racial word such as the \"N\" word in this movie has more of a satirical side to it rather than one to demean a black person. When I was watching this movie I was laughing from start to finish, there were numerous parts of the movie that played to my sense of humor and got me to laugh even though this was about a serious topic. The funniest actors of the movie in my opinion were Jamie Foxx and Samuel L. Jackson. Jacksons part in the movie as Calvin Candie's slave not only fits the time period but is outrageously funny and at times had me at the brink of tears and a serious ab workout. The comedic relief in this movie makes it a lot more enjoyable to watch rather than a movie simply about a freed slave turning the tables. When someone sees a Tarantino film such as Inglorious Bastards or Django Unchained, they think of a movie with massive amounts of action and gore. This is true because in both films there is an immense amount of killing, and we see this in the first scene of Django as Schultz violently kills one Speck brother and cripples the other. Django and Schultz travel through the movie first striking vengeance on the Brittle brothers, then going on the hunt for his lost wife. Throughout the movie killing and bloodshed cannot be escaped and is one of the main themes of the movie. There are several scenes in the movie where action and violence are the main focus, such as Django dealing out his wrath on two of the Brittle brothers and Schultz sniping the other or the massive shootout in Calvin Candie's house. While some say the movie did have some moderately funny parts, it was more of an act to relieve tension and kind of just thrown in the movie. Even though there were some parts like this, they still saw it as a movie with a bunch of action and gore and not so much laughter. Parts such as the slave being torn to shreds or Django's wife being beaten in front of him or even when she was trapped in the heat box for torture really make your stomach churn and take away any sort of laughter or smile you once had. It is his style of movies and it is either a hit or miss for the audience that watches his movies. I saw Django as more of a comedic action and gore movie rather than just strictly an action and gore movie. The comedy of it was tied in at the right points and made the movie truly a joy to watch rather than just a long action movie.",

However, the film left me grossly disappointed.The first third of this film is actually very good. It's exciting, witty, and effectively sets up a relationship between Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz's characters. However, once the 'main' plot kicks in and they begin their rescue, the film stalls considerably. The entire story from this point on is uneven and silly. There are so many unnecessary scenes and the ending in particular is just terrible. It doesn't stand up to the calibre of writing in Tarantino's other films. The acting, on the other hand, is exceptional, and probably saves the film. Everyone does a fantastic job and they deserve the praise they've received. However, this doesn't stop the film's second two-thirds being an uneven mess and with the exception of a hilarious scene featuring Jonah Hill, the film is not the gem everyone seems to be claiming it is. I was honestly convinced I saw a different film to everyone else.It's not an especially bad film; there are witty lines and solid performances.

Sadly, I feel he's starting to lose his touch by playing into the \"uber-violence\" persona he's built up for himself in Hollywood with his recent movies.This movie is almost perfect - and it could be, it has the right amount of drama, action and comedy to make it a masterpiece. Sadly, however, there are two scenes which ruin it: 1. The scene where two slaves are killing each other by beating each other to death while our heroes are calmly conversing/negotiating with the villain 2. The dog attack sceneBoth are WAAY too over the top.These two scenes were so over-done and violent that they spoiled the entire movie for me. Being a fan of Tarantino, I've come to expect that there will be some rough violence, but there needs to be a limit (unless you're creating a slasher/horror flick). It was simply too much, to the point of being gross and disturbing - especially for a western/comedy/action flick. Pick your genre. At some point enough is enough, and we GET the point... there's no need to splash images of blood, gore and listen to countless minutes of torturous screams that could have be done quickly and tastefully. I understand wanting to show the horror of the slave situation, but again - there is a point where it's done right, and when it's grossly (pun intended) over-done.I write this review to those who are expecting a comedy/western/action movie with dramatic undertone. You will be entertained, and you will be disturbed by unnecessary violence and gore usually reserved for slasher/horror/snuff films.",

            "content": "For my review I choose the film Django unchained. Django unchained is a film played by Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz. My choice is based on the fact that many of my friends recommended this movie. So I started watching the film with high expectations, normally when I have high expectations of something I always end up being disappointed. But believe it or not this time it was totally different, I loved everything about it. Django is a slave who is being transported with other slaves when suddenly they meet the mysterious German Dr. King Schultz. Schulz buys Django and promises him his freedom if he is willing to help him to hunt up three men that Schultz was searching for. I was very surprised to see how fast they captured the three men; it did not take much time. I thought that the whole point of the film was to find these three men and kill them but no; the real quest or adventure of the film begins on this point. Django has a slave wife named Bloomhilde whom he lost when they were separated a few years back. Schultz agrees to help Django with his rescue mission and together they head to a plantation in Mississippi called candieland. There she is kept captive by the racist and sadist Calvin Candie, who owns the plantation. They had a great skim and if it was not for Stephen (played by Samuel L. Jackson), Candie's household attendant, their skim would have succeeded. But when they were about to buy Bloomhilde and set her free from the hands of the evil Candie, Stephen unmasked them and from their on it was a battle between the two forces. Luckily Django was a genius in the field of gun shooting. They had had training enough; I mean they are after all bounty hunters. I liked this film, it is basically full of action and the story is moving. I know from history lessons about the slavery but I never think about how it was for the people who went through it. I saw how men and women suffered and despaired. They would fight for their lives, even though their lives didn't mean anything to the white men. This is a memorable treasure to not forget, it teaches people what happened so that maybe we could learn out of our mistakes and do some good. I should warn people who have problems with bloody movies to be careful because there is a lot of blood shade in this movie. But one thing is for sure, this film is great.",

Huge credit has to be given to Christopher Waltz as well for his breath taking role as the bounty hunter. I haven't seen him in anything for a while and i will admit i was a tad skeptical when going into this movie, because i thought he might be a bit rusty, but he really pulled out the big guns and just sucked me right in. I will say though, as an Aussie, Quintins performance towards the end completely took me out of the movie with his terrible Aussie accent. He's a great director, but an awful actor.

            "content": "Tarantino has directed some very iconic and entertaining films over the years, but, in my opinion, Django Unchained really takes the cake. It really is arguably his best piece of work! After directing a film based in the WW2 setting, Tarantino decided to move into the western genre, to great effect (even though it's actually set in the antebellum south, but still). The movie demonstrates that Tarantino can turn to gold whatever he puts his hand on.In terms of directing, Tarantino did a super job. The scenes are paced to absolute perfection, with the created atmosphere and tension in certain scenes keeping the viewer on a knife-edge. I found myself on the edge of my seat so much when watching the movie, but don't worry, even with all of the build-up, there are still plenty of action scenes. In fact, I really could say that the way in which the action is balanced out with the tension is just perfect. It puzzles me why some people said the directing was messy and the scenes were untidy, because this really isn't the case. I guess you could say that some of the comedic violence is a bit messy, but that really just added to the epic nature of the film. I mean, how can you have a Tarantino film without some of the ol' over-the-top scenes, it only add to the quality.The plot was just epic as well. It, just like the directing, is perfectly paced and the way in which it develops and unfolds. The plot is very much complex and yet easy-to-follow. The character development of the film is also pure gold, and it is really backed up by the acting.Jamie Foxx played Django incredibly well. The way in which the character develops is simply amazing, from the humble slave to the man on a mission, and again it's interesting to see the contrast from his stand-up comedy to the more serious role as the main protagonist in this film. Waltz was pure gold in his portrayal as Schultz, and Tarantino again toys with the audience by putting Waltz in a completely opposite role than what he was in Inglourious Basterds, and yet, Waltz is still able to portray this role with the exact same sophistication as his previous character had in Inglourious Basterds, even though the roles are reversed.But the most outstanding acting performance must go to Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio was just pure gold in this film, and the antagonist of Calvin Candie has to be added to the list of iconic film villains in cinema history, as the pure arrogance, greed and soulless nature of the character just really makes him memorable. It's so strange to see the once innocent DiCaprio from Titanic make his transition into the far more darker roles that he is portraying now, again another way Tarantino plays with the audience. I also have to give credit to Samuel Jackson, who you could tell really had fun portraying a humble but menacing role rather than his common loud and tough roles he played in most of his movies such as Jules in Pulp Fiction.Overall this film is an absolute epic! I'd call it one of the most entertaining and iconic films of the 21st Century so far, and I really put it at least on par with Pulp Fiction. In fact, in my opinion this one really is Tarantino's best work. Absolutely a 10/10 from me.",

It's just about the only quiet part of Quentin Tarantino's 'Django Unchained,' a boisterous, bloody blaxploitation/Western hybrid.

Whatever 'Django''s issues -- and it has a couple -- failing to deliver on its promises isn't one of them.

Tarantino's 'Unchained' is positioned as just another in a long line of 'Django' knockoffs -- albeit one with a significant upgrade in the production values department (it even cribs the original film's theme song). His Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave in the American South a few years before the Civil War, where he's purchased by a flamboyant bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz ('Inglourious Basterds'' Christoph Waltz). Schultz is on the trail of a trio of outlaws and Django has the information he needs to find them, so the German former dentist offers him his freedom in exchange for his help. Initially, their relationship is intended to last just the one job, but Django proves himself such a natural bounty hunter that Schultz decides to make him a full partner in his operation -- and to help him track down and rescue his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who has been sold at slave auction to brutal plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).",

            "content": "Django Unchained is sporadically exciting, tense, funny and engaging, yet ultimately unsatisfying and unpleasant; of all Tarantino's films, this is the one that I have the least desire to watch again. While Tarantino's (huge) influence over film in the last 20 years often boils down to his use of music, pop culture references, editing or narrative tricks, the central problems with this film are found in the two areas that Tarantino usually excels: his control over pacing and tone. Many Tarantino imitators resort to rapid editing and non-linear plots in order to create a sense of vitality and to mimic his style. However, Tarantino's best work generates this energy through sure and controlled pacing, both within individual scenes and throughout the film itself. Consider the Jews under the floor scene in Inglourious Basterds, or the opening diner discussion in Reservoir Dogs. In both, Tarantino allows the scenes to unfold organically, letting his dialogue create the momentum and interest rather than any tricky cinematography or editing. In Django Unchained, this skill deserts him. That the entire film is undeniably overlong is exacerbated by its poor structure. The first half of the film plays like a TV show or game; our heroes go from episode to episode essentially doing the same thing in the same way to undifferentiated bad guys. It is only when Di Caprio's character is introduced that the actual narrative thrust becomes apparent. More problematic is the pacing within the scenes themselves. While Tarantino does allow most of his scenes to unfold as in his superior works, most of Django Unchained lacks dynamism or uniqueness; while there are almost always scenes in his films which standout, Django is largely forgettable. One reason for this is that his writing and characters lack spark; if we compare Waltz' character here and in Inglourious Basterds \u2013 where he is essentially playing different sides of the same coin \u2013 the almost tedious nature of a lot of his scenes in Django are all too evident; being verbose does not equal being interesting. That being said, a film like Kill Bill Vol. 2 also commits lacks steadfast pacing, but is eminently more enjoyable than Django. The ultimate flaw then relates to tone. Tarantino's is a violent filmmaker, yet there is always a sense of fun in his depictions of it; he never seems mean-spirited, which makes their gratuitousness entirely acceptable and enjoyable (most of the fights in Kill Bill Vol. 1 attest to this fact). While Django does contain a lot of this kind of violence, it also contains the most brutal and cruel examples in any Tarantino film. The Mandingo fight scene and dog attack are truly horrible and lack the lightness of touch or over the top un-realism of his previous work. What makes these attacks of brutal violence so much worse is one of Tarantino's traits \u2013 the contrasting of violence and comedy. While this works effectively in his other films, here the sheer brutality of some of those scenes along the historical baggage that comes with their setting makes the broad comedic moments seem almost cringe-worthy. The tonal affects on characterisation are perhaps a more fundamental concern. Unlike in a lot of his other work, Tarantino wants us to care about the characters, particularly Django and Hilde. It is their relationship that provides the motivation for the film, and the naturalistic way that they are depicted \u2013 both in terms of their dialogue and their performances \u2013 suggests that Tarantino understood the need for both to be believable; the success of his film is intimately linked to how much we connect with them. Unfortunately, for all his brilliance as a writer, Tarantino has never been skilled at creating characters that contain 'real' emotions, who speak in a 'real' voice or who contain motivations of a 'real' person. In his classic films however, this is not a problem. In those films, Tarantino's characters are the same tokens or representations of types that we have seen in the hands of less capable writers and directors. What makes them immeasurably more enjoyable are great casting and great dialogue; these characters come to life without the need for us to invest in them because they act and sound like they need to, not because we care about them as characters per se (did anyone really care when Jules gets shot in Pulp Fiction?) While there were some fine performances in the film, particularly by Leo and Sammy L, none of the characters are given the time and depth to become anything more than mouthpieces for the dialogue (which as I have mentioned lacked Tarantino's usual spark and nuance). Take the character of Hilde, who was criminally underdeveloped in the film, particularly as Tarantino puts her through some horrible and unpleasant situations; the amount of trauma we witness being inflicted on her makes her much more deserving of depth. Regrettably when Tarantino does actually allow us moments where we can care about the outcomes of the characters, he undercuts himself by the unevenness of the tone. So, after the (first) climax of the film, our concern about the fate of Hilde and our emotional connection to what we have seen in the house, is ruined by the ridiculous scene with the 'Australians'; like the eyes in the pillow case scene, while they are funny in and of themselves, they clash with the rest of the film in an awkward and unpleasant way. Ultimately Tarantino has created a film that feels more influenced by pale versions of his own films; he forgets that aspects that were at work in his classic films and resorted to ultra- violence to stay relevant.",

This is an action adventure with lots of killings and bloody mess. Hmm, actually, if you still haven't got 'round to seeing this epic comedy set in a heart of darkness... maybe just stick to hobbits. THEN watch this and be shocked at how a GOOD film can make you feel shocked and disgusted yet for some reason smiling. Sprawling story. Wonderful performances Words both poetic and foul. The magic of Tarantino! SPOILER! Samwise lives happily ever after!",

This movie protrays a good take on slavery. Tarentino doesn't just make a movie about a black guy killing all the white people but makes it a plot of Vegence for his wife.

The dark humor, present with exaggeratedm and over the top gore.....it screams Tarantino.The cast is brilliant....Leo, Samuel, Jamie, and especially Chritoph waltz. This man truly knocks it out of the park. He steals every scene and perfects them...(dinner scene was quite immaculate).Both the cinematography and the score used in this film is perfect. In fact IMO the best score i've seen in any Tarantino film.My one small issue is the fact that the movie felt a little bit predictable, especially towards the end. But the fact the he executes the story so wonderfully makes you forget any issues.Its one of those films perfect for a Friday night. Incredibly fun.All in all i give it an 8.5",

It's interesting that even though the film is about Django, it's Dr. Schultz who steals the show. Christoph Waltz is excellent as always, and he truly embraces the charming, yet seriously intimidating character as he did in Inglorious Basterds. Jamie Foxx did a very good job as well. The violence is over the top and meant to be humorous like all Tarantino films, and it makes for very good entertainment. I strongly recommend this film to all my friends and those who have taken the time to watch it enjoyed it. Django Unchained is very important to me because it's just a beautiful, gritty, and entertaining story. A German bounty hunter helping a slave rescue his wife and make money while doing it. Just genius in my opinion. Tarantino truly deserved the Oscar for this one. If you haven't seen it, watch it.",

            "content": "This film (spoiler alert) is about a former slave and a German body hunter who become friends to battle against a plantation owner in the western era. The German Dr. Schultz (Christopher Waltz) crosses path with Django (Jamie Foxx). Since, he now he a free slave and skilled tracker thanks to Dr. Schultz. He is seeking to rescue his wife Broomhilda (Kerri Washington) from a brutal plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). So Django and Dr. Schultz teamed up and became bounty hunters together and become bounty hunters together and capture some of the most wanted men of the south. They decided to go to Candy land (Calvin) plantation and rescue Django wife, Bloomhilda. Django looked so funny in his Austin Powers outfit when walked up to one of the dudes that knew where his wife was. Django was causing a lot of hectic problems on the farm. But upon arrival they were dismayed that the slaves are casted as gladiators that Calvin and his right-hand man Billy Crash (Walton Goggin) had conquered up for competitions. Calvin and Billy used this for entertainment, but it was in order for the slaves to have some privileges living on Calvin plantation. Django and Dr. Schultz were plotting to get Broomhilda at the dinner table. Calvin his comically grumpy house slave Stephan (Samuel L. Jackson) got a wind of Django and Dr. Schultz plan and went and told the master Calvin of what they are trying to do. Everything broke loose, and it was on. To me it got exquisite towards the end of the movie and sure things Stephan was saying was funny. Now, Dr. Schultz and Django got into a gun battle with Calvin and his boys and Calvin end of killing Dr. Schultz. That was sad! I thought he would have made it out of the plantation alive, but that didn't happen. But Django ends up killing Calvin. Django battled it out until he ran out of bullets, and they end up catching Django and hanged him upside down in the barn. But Django ended up freeing his self and got out of there and ran into these two dudes. Django ended up taking their carriage and guns and tied them two dudes up. Django goes back to the plantation and getting into real blazing gunfire. Calvin sister, Stephan and a couple of the house maids come back from burying Calvin. Django went to the estate and told these two black females \"If they didn't want to die I suggest you leave; they flew out of there fast and left. Then he shot Calvin sister shoot her back to Texas. Now that was funny also. Furthermore, he found Bloomhilda and blew up the plantation.Tarantino has expressed a \"wish deal\" through the film that. America has never dealt with it because of being ashamed how they mistreated African Americans and other countries. America don't want to acknowledge it because they don't wish to deal with it or even feel they should have the right to, but the film was a form of the \"genre films\" rather an \"significant issue film\". Indeed, Django doesn't shrink these responsibilities, even if wasn't Quentin Tarantino primary concerns neither.This movie had to play over and over again in the creators mind \u2013 hence the cameos, the hat tips, the humor, the relaxed run-time but you get the sense that he's not trying to address anything so much as a hang out scenario in his own chapter of the film. The movie was so vivid and funny in certain scenes, who can blame him?",

It's not a movie about bounty hunter , it's about jealousy, race discrimination and slavery and their impact on perception of society. The only point where this movie does not gone well is the Django Freeman's attitude towards Mr. Calvin Candie and it's plantation people's. There movie is little bit unconvincing.

This movie is filled with so much good its hard to name. All of the performances are fantastic. Even the lesser roles are fun such as Don Johnson or the bag heads, who have maybe the funniest scene in the movie. Its really hard to say who steals the show. I would say Christoph Waltz, but he already played this sort of character in Inglourious. Leo is usually pretty good, but he's great here as the brilliant villain Calvin Candie. Sam Jackson was also fantastic as his character. Foxx is pretty great too especially as his character grows to be more confident throughout the movie.As usual for Tarantino it is drenched in fantastic dialogue, style and blood. The musical choices are once again great. And the whole movie is amazingly memorable. Every little scene is easily memorable. Tarantino just has that quality I suppose. It's hard to really nitpick anything. Maybe it's too long but it uses every second to its advantage. Another amazing Tarantino movie. 10/10",

            "content": "Django Unchained ReviewThe American Western film genre was lacking a strong and heroic black protagonist. Django Unchained fills that gap and then some with a well-done performance by Jamie Foxx as Django. As he is tough, independent, and charming character that perfectly fulfills Western gunslinger role. Django has become an iconic Western character up there with the likes of the characters played by Clint Eastwood and John Wayne. Django is a worthy gun slinging hero for the 21st century. Django begin the film as a slave, but with the help of a German bounty hunter Schultz, played by Christopher Waltz, Django gets his freedom in support for information to complete a bounty out on the Brittle Brothers. Django eventually becomes a bounty hunter himself and sets out to both get revenge for his years as a slave and rescue his wife Broomhilda, played by Kerry Washington, from a Southern plantation owner Candie, played by Leonardo di Caprio. The star studded cast fits into their roles with perfection. Each acting performance is superb. Jamie Foxx who begins as a low talking slave arcs into one of most iconic gun slinging figures in American Western film. As for Di Caprio, he plays his most unlikeable character yet. I would argue, however, that Django Unchained is one of his best performances as an actor. Next Waltz also again delivers yet another quality performance to match his role in Inglorious Bastards. It seems that Tarrentino brings the best out of him. Further, worth noting is that the lesser known Don Johnson as \"Big Daddy\" Bennet also shines as he is somehow able to master both being comedic and grossly racist.However, as good as all the acting performances are, it is Samuel L. Jackson, as Stephen a slave who thinks he is better than all the other slaves, who truly rocks this movie. You will forget that it is even Jackson in the movie as Jackson, who usually plays strong characters like a Jedi master in Star Wars or a well-spoken gangster in Pulp Fiction, transform into a pathetic creep, who not only keeps himself bound to servitude but also his other fellow slaves.The film like Inglorious Bastards before it is a historical revenge film about the injustices against a minority group. In Inglorious Bastards it was the Jews getting revenge against Nazi Germany and in Django Unchained it is African Americans getting revenge against the American South for its participation in slavery and racism. What Tarrentino can do so well is highlight a serious topic but at the same time be able to deliver some humorous moments (the scene with the masks being the most notable). Django Unchained like a lot of Tarrentino's works can mix the brutal and the humorous so well. If you love Tarrentino's past works you will also really like this film.The film has two flaws. The first is that there is very little arc by the supporting characters in the film. If a character was good in the beginning they were good till the end and vice versa. Unlike Tarrentino's best work Pulp Fiction none of the characters seem very deep and layered. Rather, instead the characters in the film although memorable go through very little transformation. This makes Django Unchained lack a deeper meaning and seem to predictable compared to what can be found in Pulp Fiction. Secondly, the film I think wastes the opportunity to use Kerry Washington to her fullest capabilities. She is a talented actor and deserved more on-screen time to build up her character and relationship with Django.",

Django free from his slavery condition seems to be Dr Schultz puppet : the last straw! USA history is replete with inspiring black heroes examples able to give a better inspiration.A clumsy sentimental story mixed with the duo-clich\u00e9 : immoral ferocity give the right for savage revenge supposed to relieve our conscience from the past. We have the feeling that Tarentino use this guilty conscience by creating this soulless hero. What was the main accusation against slavery if not admit these people has their own soul?Some tacit rules had been set by Italian Western revolution. A subtle mix between drama and strong acid humor, at least one epic scene, a characters association about an unequivocally and strictly material goal. In this \"Django Unchained\", of course humor is present but in a very Monthy Phyton's way that cuts all kind of tension effect. What is supposed to be dramatic is not in as much as these violent scenes are directly inspired by \"Hitchy & Scratchy\" a self-proclaimed parody. The characters association ? A bounty hunter ready to risk his own life (plus his money) to get join two lovebirds, ...come on!Remains the excellent Christoph Waltz, his mannerism, his diction have a true impact contrasting in the middle of this environment. Leornardo Di Caprio plays both with refinement and amplitude a real first class bad man. Dialogues between these two composers are the most delicious moments in this movie unfortunately underused and quickly interrupted. Once these two sacrificed, we yet know the end and no more than half an hour of movie remains.So half an hour I passed picking up paps around. This nth blockbuster discount scene where our hero make the bad man's house blowing up and where he stands here without even loose his hat. They really have to find anything else to wake us up. Our hero doing some style figure from riding school, \u0085 this... a Western?This recycling in Tarentino's movies is not too surprising but concerning the soundtrack, we are far from a remake of the original, so isn't it too obviously easy to take back tracks from Corbucci's original \"Django\" ? The \"buttonhole flower bleeding\" took back from \"Il Mercenario\" from the same Corbucci from who Tarentino took back the same soundtrack for \"Kill Bill\".More than a tribute this is pillaging.May be I loved too much Tarantino's \"Pulp fiction\" and \"Jackie Brown\" and too much Italian Westerns too.

How can Tarantino keep pumping out consistently amazing films? \"Django Unchained\" is another period piece following 2009's \"Inglourious Basterds\" and \"Django\" is every bit as brutal as \"Basterds.\" In fact, \"Django\" may be Tarantino's most brutal film yet. Not just violent, but racially charged, cringe-inducing ferocity. The film is rated R by the MPAA that sights, among other things, \"a vicious fight.\" Vicious, indeed. Perhaps the most vicious I have ever seen. The plot concerns Christoph Waltz's Dr. King Schultz purchasing Jamie Foxx's Django since Django can identify the Brittle Brothers, who have bounties on their heads. Dr. Schultz is a bounty hunter and Django soon joins in on the profession seeing as the prospect of killing white people for money is too enticing to pass up. What comes next is a dazzling display involving a rich plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio in a role he sinks his teeth deeply into) and his loyal house slave (Samuel L. Jackson). The performances alone are enough to make this film worthwhile, it's about time we get another astonishing performance from Waltz after \"Basterds.\" It's no coincidence that Tarantino constantly gets great performances out of his actors. The man is a great director. Not only a great director, but a great writer as well. True, the female characters are left a tad hollow, but the well-rounded male characters distract from this. Weaving a tale of submission and dominance, Tarantino walks a fine line and the result is sometimes hysterical (I found myself laughing uncontrollably at the KKK scene), sometimes tragic, often brutal but always entertaining. Quentin Tarantino's career is one that hit the gas with \"Reservoir Dogs\" and hasn't touched the brakes since.",

Among the work done by Quentin Tarantino it sits right at the top with his other masterpieces, the direction and editing is top notch you won't feel detached from the movie even for a single second. When you talk of performance Jamie Foxx as Django is amazing and without any doubts is one of his best performances , Christopher waltz as King Schultz is simply amazing and adds a different flavor whenever he's on screen , a complete performance I would say with those pinches of humor. Leonardo DI Caprio and Samuel Jackson again enthrall us with their amazing performances . For everyone who has loved and lived western this is a must watch , the best western of recent times. the story telling is good and apart from all that i loved the OST, For me it brings back the magic of old Westerns. so m gonna go have a good time again, you guys watch it and have a good time too .",

But it also does more than that. It's a simple scene that speaks for the whole film. It's an affirmation that this man of color is now free and able to make his own decisions. The choice he made concerning his extravagantly loud outfit acts as a warning to those that plan to stand in his way-watch out, here I come, I ain't gonna be quiet no more.And the humor the scene provides echoes the entire film-it wants us to get comfortable with our hero. Tarantino knows that a man of color makes an unconventional hero in a revenge- flick-that's why he made the film. When was the black man going to get his revenge film? It's been long overdue. With Django Unchained, that film has finally arrived and it has arrived in style. Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and meticulously written, it's Tarantino at his most epic.",

            "review_title": "The D is Silent: Review of Django Unchained",
            "content": "But that is the only thing that is silent in Quentin Tarantino's film Django Unchained. The titular Django, played by Jaime Foxx, is a slave who is acquired by a German-born bounty hunter King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) who needs Django to assist him on a bounty hunting mission. Aside from bounty hunting with Schultz, Django's main focus is to free his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from wily plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). With that set-up, the movie is a full-on, bloody, western-style revenge fantasy and rescue-the-fair-maiden story. But, instead of being set in the Wild Wild West, it's set in the South prior to the Civil War. And, instead of John Wayne or Clint Eastwood, a black man saves the day.Every Tarantino film is violent and this one is no different. Because of his penchant for violent tales, I believe Tarantino was less timid than most filmmakers would be in portraying some of the more brutal aspects of slavery like when BroomHilda is branded with a hot iron and when Candie forces male slaves to fight to the death for entertainment (\"Mandingo fighting\"). The film is no great revelation about the institution of slavery and it's certainly no historical drama. And Tarantino tempers much of the violence with humor such as a scene in which a befuddled group of white vigilantes complain about not being able to see through the holes of the white bags over their heads. And I can't even begin to decipher all the B-movie and pop-culture references Tarantino planted in the story. (Did Tarantino intentionally make Samuel L. Jackson's character--duplicitous house slave Stephen--look like Uncle Ruckus from The Boondocks)? But, undoubtedly, I wanted Django to exact his revenge and ride into the night with his wife. And neither Tarantino nor Foxx disappoint on that score. (I'm already ready for the sequel. Jamie, you're a bad m...!) The most thought-provoking part of the film for me was when Candie states how he doesn't understand why the slaves he has lived with all his life didn't kill him or his family. And I wonder if I had been born into slavery like my ancestors would I have been able to free myself. There are at least 250 known rebellions by slaves in the United States and who knows how many countless other acts of resistance. Django is a great fantasy adventure, but I can't wait to see mainstream feature films on Nat Turner and Toussaint L'Ouveture, who are real-life Djangos.",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino is known for taking a typical film story and turning it on its head in such a way that the story teller himself is the actual star of the film. If you think back to films like Pulp Fiction, Foxy Brown, Kill Bill or Reservoir Dogs, there isn't a single event in any of these stories that film goers are not familiar with; yet, like Cohen Brother's films, we go to see just how Tarantino will tell the tale. Django is one of those films which is so bizarre that I predict most people who see it, will see it more than once to make sure they actually saw what they thought they saw. The difference with Django is that it is the truth that is more bizarre than anything the storyteller does with the story.The main character is a freed slave, traveling to the deep south to rescue his slave wife. What is bizarre is the true accounts of inhumanity of slave-holding America. As the character goes deeper south, man's mistreatment of his fellow man gets sicker. I find myself asking Did people really treat each other in such ways? The answer is yes, of course. In this one film, full of chains, shackles, whips, bills of sale, human branding, and slaves forced to fight to the death for entertainment, the director doesn't have to invent bizarre scenes because they were all parts of American history that was too bizarre to be believed. As the vengeance killings increase in cruelty, the viewer is forced to realized that this is what you come to a Tarantino film for, so how much better are we than those characters in the film being entertained by it. This director has made a career out of borrowing from obscure Japanese cinema styles and bringing them to the American audience. With Django, he takes the Spaghetti Western and adds the harsh truth; the one thing missing from the genre that turns it on its head.",

Very tense the situation gets when the protagonists throughout the event overturns because of bad situation or something and it's amazing to see how they manage and especially Waltz leave or handle the situation with the delicacy of the speak. The end a little \"fan- service\" I would call something that all expected. I do not give 10 for the duration of the film nearly 3 hours and have to endure.

If you're black I imagine you already knew about the house slaves and all that, but even the head of the African-American studies department at Harvard has never seen a horse drawn carriage with a slave master aboard pull up to a Mississippi plantation. This is as close as it gets! The appearance of Stephen might be the best scene in the history of movies.

            "content": "Is it even a remote possibility that one day, Quentin Tarantino will make a film which does not involve scenes of grotesque violence? We all doubt it. It seems as if every film he makes now is a gauntlet thrown down to his next piece of work, setting a new standard in terms of graphic violence. Django Unchained is the perfect example. Not content with close-up shots of Nazis having swastikas carved into their foreheads, Tarantino opts for an absurd amount of gory CGI- embellished shooting scenes in the Western, which is really a collage of different genres rather obviously thrown together. Perhaps it is the director's penchant for combining very dark and real subject matters with a splattering of comic violence and humour that makes his films so successful and enjoyable. They are also, however, becoming more and more artistically indulgent. The ludicrously violent last half hour serves no purpose other than to shock audiences and amplify the violence in 60s Westerns, with which Tarantino doubtless wasn't satisfied as a kid. It should be noted that these most explicit scenes follow the demise of the film's two best characters, Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio. The former plays a remarkably human, funny and cynical German bounty hunter. The best scenes are those in which he is conversing with the surprisingly despicable DiCaprio, a psychopathic plantation owner utterly absorbed in his own self-importance. I couldn't help thinking that parts of his performance were just extensions of Tarantino's disturbed personality. Tarantino and Waltz, however are a perfect match of director and actor. They really are on the same level as Tarantino- L. Jackson and Scorcese- De Niro. As in Inglorious Basterds, the latter provides brilliantly funny and articulate dialogue amidst the gratuitous violence and controversy. Despite the presence of a more famous and popular actor, Jamie Foxx, playing the lead role, the eccentric Austrian steals the show as he did in Inglorious, which had Brad Pitt in the leading role. His charismatic European charm highlights a deficiency in American cinema in the past decade, which has been dominated by predictable American heroes and foreign villains. DiCaprio, for that matter, is a wonderful villain. Clinging onto the last strands of his power soon to anyhow be destroyed by the Civil War, he contradicts himself in so many ways, looking for a justification for the atrocities he is committing. That justification is boredom- with too much power and too much money, he cannot resist dabbling in the brutal (exemplified in two nauseatingly graphic scenes.) Samuel L. Jackson has a sinister turn as the slave master of Candyland, DiCaprio's plantation. He is perhaps even more despicable than his master, carrying a scheming authority over the other slaves in the plantation and even a hold over his master, despite his exaggerated subservience.Despite my criticism (which is always going to happen when I watch Tarantino), Django is a thoroughly enjoyable film. The horrifically awkward subject matter is dealt with head on, an approach which Tarantino and the actors must be given enormous credit for doing. It is, at heart, an underdog-hero story and a love story, which are pervasive themes in American cinema. Foxx is low-key in the first half, very much second fiddle to Waltz. He grows in confidence though, helped by some wonderfully-timed lines in the script delivered with a little of his own malice. There is a very funny scene which completely takes apart the KKK, appropriately exposing them as a bunch of incompetent rednecks. Scenes like these go some way to help detract the shock of the violence and provide comic relief. Off the top of my head, I cannot think of another film that deals with this chapter of American history in such depth and detail. Tarantino knows that tweaked history is always going to be an incredibly popular genre and as in Inglorious, the result is edgy and controversial. But most of the best films are.",

            "content": "Finally! The movie I have been waiting for since they announced it last year. As a hardcore-cinema-visitor I can say I have seen around 100 movies in the past year. I almost live in the cinema. So I can be a little harsh on criticizing 90% of all the bad movies that come out. I have seen every trick and story to many times. There were only a handful of movies I had really high expectations for. Django Unchained was one of them. I can't go wrong with this. I'm a big fan of Western movies and Tarantino films. Typical Tarantino:Django Unchained has typical Tarantino Dialog. And this is awesome as you would except from him. There are some funny scenes and even more funny subtle phrases. The Funniest character for me was played by Samual Leroy Jackson. As a black man hating black man. It felt like the character from the Boondogs. There were some hillbilly's that acted very funny and stupid. The action scenes are crazy and awesome. They are not to careful with the blood. And it's violent. I love it. The acting was really great and believable. Christof waltz was amazing. But the one that really amazed me was Leonardo Dicaprio. You can almost taste the ego of the man. He is so harsh to black people and talks about it like it's normal to literally trade them like that. And in one scene at a dinner table, he grabs a skull. Then you know stuff is about to get real and aggressive. I was staring at the screen when he grabbed Broomhilda and wanted to hit her with a hammer. I would almost hate Leonardo for it. This is perfect acting. Dislikes:But there are some minor critics. First of all the music. I did not care for most of the soundtracks. The only soundtracks I liked were from an older western named Django. Very nice opening for a film, but it went on a little to long. And some classical music that did (almost) fit. There was one particular scene in the mansion of Calvin Candie, where Schultz was waiting for Broomhilda to come to his room. The music at this point made me feel very awkward. It did not fit this scene. Also at the shoot-out between Django and a lot of guys in the mansion. They show some slow motion shots of Django being a bad ass. That's can be cool if they played Ennio Morricone or similar. But no. Some (c)rap music entered the scene. This didn't fit the scene at all. I know that Tarantino has a certain comical style that worked in other movies. But Reservoir dogs and pulp fiction are set in more modern world then this 1850 setting. And that music fitted perfect in those films.Soundtracks can be very important for movies. Alsmost 50% of importance. But because I liked the Mise-en-Scene very much I can only take away 2 stars from the music. So that's 10-2=8 stars. Maybe I will get used to the music after watching it more times. I would certainly watch this movie again while it's in the big screen because the shots and dialog are amazing.",

He depicts characters and story with humor. And bullets, of course. I think this is one of Tarantino's best, actually,next to Pulp Fiction and maybe Reservoir Dogs. Quentin Tarantino is one of Hollywood's most controversial, creative and best directors/writers.The fact that Argo could have won best picture at the academy awards over Django Unchained I still cannot cope with. But I guess the academy was bribed or something... Thank God it won best screenplay, though. The script is one of the best I've ever encountered. The dialog and characters are well worked out.

I enjoyed the choice of music and the references to series B westerns. There are also several comic moments in the film, well calculated as a relief to the tension created by the violence. The Ku Klux Klan scene, inserted at a point where we fear for our heroes, was hilarious and is bound to become a classic clip. Beautifully done and fully recommended.",

The biggest complaint I have ever had with his films is his own acting, or lack thereof, and bringing a scene down. But he stepped up this time and threw in a little quirkiness of his own, and he did a great job of it (I really don't think that Tarantino being in his own film counts as a spoiler, but I figured better to be safe) and the scene was terrific.",

Well I can safely say that \"Django Unchained\" defiantly delivers!Set in 1858, Dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), buys the freedom of a slave Django (Jamie Foxx). Schultz is looking for the Brittle brothers to collect a bounty that's been put on their heads and Django is the only person who can identify the brothers, so In return he must help find and identify them. During their journey to find and kill the Brittle brothers, Schultz learns that Django was actually in love and married to Broomhilda. Broomhilda was the servant of a German mistress who taught her German so that she would have someone to talk to. She was then sold to her U.S owner where she met Django and fell in love. Their owner didn't approve of the marriage so they decided to escape but they were caught and punished by the Brittle brothers who tortured them and branded their faces with the mark of a runaway. After being tortured and branded they are sold to different owners.After the job is done and Django now has his freedom he plans to go and find his wife and buy her freedom, Schultz who is impressed by Django's \"natural\" marksmanship proposes a deal, together they will go around collecting bounties throughout the winter and after that Schultz will help Django get his wife's freedom. Django agrees to the proposal and as promised after a winter of collecting various bounties Schultz and Django begin their journey to \"Candy Land\" to buy Broomhilda's freedom from Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), however it will include an elaborate scheme and this is where things get interesting.As always with a Tarantino film you can expect violence, a brilliant narrative, in-depth character development and of course witty dialog which makes the 2 hours and 45 minutes fly by, keeping the audience engrossed in the film. Everyone was brilliant in the movie and I personally love Samuel Jackson's character Stephen who when first is introduced will have you laughing your ass off. Django Unchained is like \"Marmite\", your either going to love it (like I did) or hate it. By Fiaz Ali",

The characters on the other hand are very well thought-of and make it a lot more interesting as it progresses. I gotta confess, the first part of the movie (with the bounty-hunter theme) was more enjoyable to me than the latter (with the whole \"save Broomhilda\" theme). I was also pretty disappointed with the dull way Dr. Schultz and Calvin died, i was expecting something more epic since they were the best characters in the film.At first i thought Tarantino made a weird choice with the cast(especially with Jamie Foxx as Django) but i was proved wrong, the acting is just superb. Leonardo DiCaprio and Jamie Foxx both put on spectacular performances but by far the best actor which outdid himself, just as in Basterds, was Christoph Waltz. I'd say he's one of the best at the moment.The production value is top-notch just as in every Tarantino film. The soundtrack is also very good, but probably my least favorite of all of Tarantino's films. The last song of the film before the credits, Trinity by Franco Micalizzi, really killed me since that's probably my favorite movie theme ever.Going into this i expected something VERY different but overall i highly enjoyed this, i think just as every Tarantino fan would.",

Also Jamie Foxx who seems to go unnoticed in the acting business but always nails his roles and this is no exception. Django has several hilarious scenes and one scene in particular- the bag scene(you'll get it when you see it)- made me laugh so hard I almost fell off my chair, and Jonah Hill was in that scene by the way.The movie was a crazy ride and there were very few moments of dullness but the rest of the movie made up for it TRUST ME.I have seen Lincoln, TDKR, Avengers but this movie tops them all without a doubt in my head. If it doesn't win movie of the year it would be robbed! The only complaints I have and why it's not a 10 out of 10 is that it is a little too long and has a whole lot of dirty violence, DIRTY violence and it is quite disturbing.

            "content": "A lot of people thought they knew what to expect from Django Unchained, his director, Quentin Tarantino, who is finally able to make his tribute to spaghetti western, a genre he has been mimicking since a few movies (Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds)Now, around the movie, a current topic is \"As Tarantino gone too far with Django and slavery ?\". Such an issue is understandable as the history of the USA is plagued by the ghosts of racism, and also because the movie is a big hit considering Christmas is usually the worse time of year for R-rated movies. Django is one of the few Hollywood blockbusters who really is about ideas, messages and themes, and not a movie featuring superheroes crossovers, licensed merchandise or more of the same generic action thriller and/or romantic comedy. The spectator here is expected to think, and because the movie is touching a very sensible issue, some people were obviously going to think \"Is what I am watching racist or insensitive?\". In my opinion, no. A movie telling the story of a freed slave becoming a hardened bounty hunter and fighting a slave owner for his wife can qualified by a lot a thing, but racist is not one of them. Tarantino's movie were always controversial, and this one wasn't going to be any different. Although it is a sound reasoning that slavery should not be use in a movie for the silliness of it, it that really what Django is about ? Mindless and silly action wrapped around slavery ? Tarantino is widely seen as this adolescent and eccentric movie geek making movies out of other movies he liked, and so people assumed there is all there is to it. Kill Bill is still seen as this crazy gory flick, but is, on the contrary, a very emotional movie fueled with a true passion for its genre where the climax of 3 hours of screen time is a 20 minutes dialogue about a relationship gone bad between two deadly assassins. A long, meaningful dialogue about responsibility, parenthood and pop culture references. So, what is the spaghetti western genre and what does he do with it ? Spaghetti western was about taking the clean and gentle iconic cowboy and transforming it by confronting him to the much more darker reality of the wild west. In \"The Good, the Dad and the Ugly\", the hero with no name played Clint Eastwood left his accomplice for dead in the desert multiple times, even though he is the \"Good\" in the title. (Conveniently, the famous hero with no name in spaghetti westerns will later be referred to in later movies as Django.) So, all is Tarantino is finally doing is repeating the process by using the iconic figure of the cowboy and using it in the most shameful time of American history. Tarantino barely hides the fact that he transform a Caucasian hero into an African-American one just so the spectator can notice how we lack similar characters in today's culture. The movie has a lot of hints about what the realisator wanted to do with slavery, such as the obvious scenes where a slaver's blood is spattered in a cotton field or when the ultimate evil the heroes face is a manipulative and dangerous house slave. Tarantino is not arming the memory of slavery at all, he is magnifying it with a comic book-like exaggeration the ugliness and the atrocities of the pre-Civil War era, so the spectator can feel empathy for the hero and the other African Americans. If anything, Tarantino is keeping the memory of slavery alive.This is why Django Unchained is a great movie. Not only it is a well directed and intelligent movie about a sensible issue, Tarantino also made a glorious tribute to a genre he loved and will be an instant classic.",

Christoph Waltz is not only inconsistent concerning his profession, but also his role. Formerly a dentist, now a bounty hunter, the German Dr. King Schultz roams the Wild West and seems to transcend from the role of the leading lecturer to the sidekick. By introducing Djamie Foxx (\"The D is silent\") as Django, Tarantino caps it all off. This is only overtrumped by the bizarre coming together with the original Django protagonist Franco Nero.

Then tracked Broomhilda was in Candieland owned by Monsieur Calvin Candie(Leonardo do Caprio). They planned to get his wife with a some plans. All set gone well until Stephen(Samuel.L.Jackson) found out that Broomhilda was the wife of Django by their activities during dinner. Soon, Candie discovered he got cheated and threatened Schultz to pay as per agreement else he would kill Broomhilda. Schultz paid the amount for Broomhilda instead of a Mandingo fighter. Finally,Candie insists Schultz to shake his hands. But Schultz exposed all his anger by killing Candie during the handshake. Then stage shoot fight happens and Django became slave again. During the transportation he tricked the leads,killed them and return to Candieland and retrieves Broomhilda by burning the house. Starting from the first scene where Schultz accompanied Django to final scene where Django accompanied Broomhilda,the film was set completely interesting what will happen next. The scenes which are,Schultz talking to the town Marshall,Schultz's conversation with Big Daddy Bennett, Django and Candie's scene in D'Artagnan's dog biting scene, Candie portraying the scar in the skull during dinner and Schultz shooting Candie saying I couldn't resist are the scenes which only Tarantino will be able to direct. The dialogues were well written as each and every dialogue will be circulate through your mind. The highlight of the movie is Christoph Waltz and his brilliant acting. Cinematography and the sound track were extraordinary. The medium tempo before the song'His name is King,he had a horse' which is out of world,I say. Overall,Tarantino excels in all aspects of movie and if Sergio Leone were now,he would be so amazed by this modern western by Tarantino.",

            "content": "With any Quentin Tarantino directed movie you know that you are going to be watching a motion picture that has it's share of twists, spin and reverse spin. \"Pulp Fiction\" was brilliantly filmed with various perspectives from the mix of characters. And \"Inglorious Bastards\" was equally imaginative with presenting an alternative ending to WWII. Plus, it introduced a superb actor Christoph Waltz to American audiences.I have seen my share of Western movies in my lifetime. I always thought that John Wayne and Clint Eastwood were the perennial bad asses and the gold standard of Western actors. Basic plots were fine, even the more bizarre Western stories such as \"The Wild Wild West\" with Robert Conrad were OK in my book. And then, enter Quentin Tarantino's take on a Western.... \"Django Unchained\" featured an amazing cast including headliners: Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Don Johnson, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Christoph Waltz. Great actors with a horrible script. The movie directed and (choke) written by Quentin Tarantino. It could not have been much worse, and even those terrific aforementioned actors could not save this. \"Django Unchained\" story line is not overly complicated, and might have made a decent western IF it just maintained some flow. The setting is pre-Civil War,in the South. Bounty hunter, Dr. King Shultz, (Christoph Waltz) frees Django (Jamie Foxx) early in the movie and they team up to make money from collecting bounties, and free his wife Broomhilda Von Shaft (Kerry Washington.)The movie becomes full of violence to the point where it is nearly silly. You see slaves abused with whippings, beatings, locked into steel boxes in the sun, eaten by dogs, with \"nigguh\" being spoken so often, you would think that you were at a 'lil Jon or Ice Cube concert. It is completely desensitizing.As the story develops further, with most of the outlaws dead, Django and Dr. Shultz ride to free Broomhilda from slavery at a plantation called \"Candyland\" owned by Calvin Candie (Dicaprio.) Candyland is part plantation, and part whorehouse. As it turns out, Calvin also has a passion for watching slaves from the Mandingo tribe fight to the death. In fact, a fight takes place in the main house directly in front of him with the fighters never moving more than 4-feet in any direction as though they were fighting in a phone booth. Of course, one of the fighters ends the fight with eye-gouging, and punches to get a submission from the other...only put out of his misery with a hammer. Beyond gross. The real reason that Dr. Shultz and Django are there is uncovered by the slave overseer, \"Stephen\" (Samuel L. Jackson.) Moving right along, with the rouse exposed, the killing spree starts. I have no idea how the house even contained that many cowboys and henchmen of Calvin Candy. The scene reminded me of the \"Crazy 88's\" gang in \"Kill Bill 2\" being slaughtered by Uma Thurman. There is a tremendous amount of blood splattered onto the walls with bodies piling up everywhere. Most everyone in the main cast is killed, and eventually Django is captured and sold to a mining company to be worked to death. Quentin Tarantino makes a brief appearance as an Australian cowboy that is in the process of delivering slaves to the mining company. (By now, you will have been looking at your watch wondering when this film might ever end.) In the final scene, Django tricks his captures and kills the other two with him. Of course, he returns to Candyland to take revenge on all the remaining survivors of the previous night's gunfight. Django gets his wife and ride off with Candyland blown all to bits. \"Django Unchained\" is a ridiculous movie that becomes unintentionally funny. Picture \"Blazing Saddles meets \"Kill Bill 2\" in a western setting and you are almost there. I hated the movie, but thought that the acting was terrific.",

The actors kept their performances real based on the time period of this movie. It was a emotional ride from sad, disgusted and joyful. i think viewers would enjoy this action packed performance on a grand scale. it been a long time coming for a movie that shows a different side of a dark chapter in American history, even if part was probably just purely fiction. As Spike Lee said, slavery was not a western, it was a holocaust.

Django Unchained is much tamer in comparison. It's a pretty good movie, don't get me wrong, but it does not really reach the level of brilliance of Inglorious Basterds. It does have a couple of tension filled moments but not quite as nail biting for me.The actors however are brilliant: Terrific performances all around. The stand out performance for me was Samuel L Jackson. Can't believe that was Nick Fury, incredible! My biggest disappointment was the character played by Christoph Waltz. I felt if his character in this movie was swapped with the one he played in Inglorious Basterds, there would be no difference what so ever. Not sure why Tarantino would do that, except for the fact the Waltz plays that character brilliantly.Overall, I think what works most, is that Tarantino has given this movie some breathing room from Inglorious Basterds, but unfortunately it was a bit too long and slow.Conclusion: if you liked GB, you'll like this one as well but probably not love it.",

            "content": "The residue of the history of slavery still pervades happenings in the African American community and in the larger context the global community. Slavery in the United States officially began in 1619 in Virginia where able bodied men and women were stolen or given away from their West African, Central and South East African homes to work as non person in a country that was unfamiliar. The thirteenth amendment in 1865 officially abolished slavery, the after effects of the slave act existed and some say still exists centuries after. So, it is no surprise that a movie like Django unchained is being viewed as a very controversial one. Many important African American spokespeople in the arts like Spike Lee, who put African American Film makers on the map, have been quite outspoken about detesting the movie and themes portrayed in the movie. He views this movie as an insult on a painful heritage and that those who came together to create and promote this movie have no respect for the history of pain of the African American people. Is he right? I really don't know but I did enjoy the movie when I saw it.The setting of Django Unchained is in Mississippi, United States during the period in which African Americans were slaves. It explores the concept of love, how love can make a person question what is considered normative, give the person the strength to stand and fight if necessary. Django fell in love with a slave girl who according to social strata was ahead of him because she was a house slave while he was a field slave. They fell in love, got married and ran away with hopes of getting to a place where they can be free. Unfortunately, they were caught and in punishment, both of them were sold separately. Django's punishment was that he was to be sold at the lowest price so anyone can get him, while his wife's face was marked with a tattoo, thereby ensuring that she can never be a visible house slave. Django is eventually rescued by a bounty hunter who needs help in finding some criminals. In the process, they become friends and Django shares his plans of finding his wife. Beyond the friendship that builds between them, Django gains his confidence and accepts his humanity while learning new skills that will help him survive in a new world where he is no longer a slave. They eventually track down his wife and save her after killing so many people.Of course, being a movie by Quentin Tarantino, a lot of blood letting is to be expected and so there was no surprise there. It is quite safe to say there were lots of gunshots, rivers of blood, mature language and some mature scenes. This movie is not PG13. Now, beyond the content of the movie being a controversial one dealing with the issue of slavery in the United States, controversiality lies in its portrayals of the African American casts, in who directed the movie and if he has the right to tell this story the way he did, and if this movie is disrespectful? Personally, I found the movie well crafted and the content followed a logical progression. There were pleasant surprises through the movie. I loved how the director infused the movie with humor, so even though it was a dark movie and the theme was quite bitter but there were points in which you found yourself laughing and then wondering if you should really be laughing. The comedic relief was on point and occurred at the right places. Now, considering that Quentin is a Caucasian man telling an African American story, some have wondered if he understands the context and subtexts portrayed through his movie. They've wondered if some of his unchecked and subliminal perceptions are what we see in the movie, particularly when we look at the issue of casting.Some have complained that his cast of African American characters were one dimensional while many of the Caucasian actors were multidimensional. For example, the role played by Leonardo Dicaprio was a man who was a slave owner, loved watching slave fights, yet had a black mistress, had a slave that he paid particular attention to (I suspected that they might have been in a relationship), loved his sister but had no problems having dogs tear up a human being for daring to run away. That's multidimensional: a mix of the good and the bad. The African American characters were flat, basically there to do what they were told to do, they showed almost no emotions beyond the ones of servitude or fear. Django was different but then some have complained that he wasn't able to translate emotions clearly and as such he could not carry one along with his acting. This could account for Jamie Fox not being nominated for any awards so far for this movie. This isn't his best movie. He did better in Ray.www.pamelastitch.com",

But luckily was I wrong. I honestly never thought we'd see a brand new, original, rugged and tough, slightly sarcastic at times, and mostly quiet, loner cowboy just like the timeless old spaghetti westerns. But being as Tarantino is such a fan of Sergio Leone classics like the Dollars trilogy, and other great films, I guess I should have known better. Needless to say, Foxx pulled it off like no other, and I sincerely hope there are sequels.Also, Christoph Waltz may just be one of the most talented actors in our time. If you enjoyed his menacing performance in \"Inglorious Basterds\", then you will be far from disappointed with him in Django Unchained. Leonardo DiCaprio aced his part by playing one of the most evil antagonists I have seen in a long while. His performance was perfect, and truly convincing.I hope people enjoy it as much I do.",

If this movie was meant to be against racism it failed miserably. Despite Django being saved by a white man from hes slavers, helping him get back on the people that hurt him and find hes wive so they can reunite.Django says on numerous occasions that he enjoys \"killing white people\" and not the slavers specifically or the ones who look down on him. He seem to be absolutely filled with hatred against the white race.Although this is understandable considering what he has gone through and how he and hes wive has been treated, it sends the wrong message to the audience. This movie promotes racism and does not do what i think it intended to do - be an opponent to racism.Beyond that, the production values are for the most part great and acting as i've said above is very good.

Way longer than The Great Gatsby, and that's saying something. I watched this movie around 8:30 and then ended way late. I was so tired that I went to sleep before it was finished and watched the rest the next morning. Granted, it might have been so long 'cause I had a ton of interruptions like phone calls, people at the door, and whatnot. Well, here is my character overview/review: Django: I liked Django good enough. He was a good hero. I thought it was hilarious when he got to pick his own clothes and chose to wear that blue suit. Overall, I was intrigued by Django's story.Dr. King Schultz: Schultz is definitely my favorite character. He's really funny and not to mention compassionate.Calvin Candie: Leonardo DiCaprio did a really good job as Calvin. The character he played was despicable but he played it really well.Broomhilda: I really like Kerry Washington as a an actress. I especially like her in Scandal. So, I was excited to see her in Django. But, I was kinda disappointed that she wasn't in it much and she didn't really speak. Other than that, she did well.My Verdict: Watch it but beware for a long 2 hr 45 min movie. There's also lots of graphic violence and swearing.Your Turn: What did you think of the movie? I'd love to hear. So, post in the comments!!Buzz ya later,Beans",

            "content": "'Django Unchained', directed and written by the infamous Quentin Tarantino is his most controversial yet. He employs a ridiculous amount of usage of the 'n' word. He did say he wanted this movie to unlock the taboo subject of slavery and get it talked about. Is this a bit of self righteousness from Tarantino? I'd say yes. He has indulged himself in high budget films for about 20 years this year. He started with an iconic, revolutionary classic that is Reservoir Dogs. Then he got braver with Pulp Fiction and, incredibly well I might add, paid off. Unfortunately this was released at the same time as 'Forrest Gump' which left Tom Hanks and his crew leaving the Academy Awards with 6 Oscar's. From this point, it seems to me that he believes that the most, audience pleasing, indulgent movie is the way to go about receiving Oscar's and of course: fame. This has up to now, left us with 'Django Unchained'.I'd say the cast involved is spectacular. I don't know how else it would've been improved. Christopher Waltz equals his performance in Tarantino's previous film 'Inglourious Basterds' and transfers from the antagonist to the sidekick come trainer. It is hugely similar to other revenge movies such as 'Gladiator' in the character sense of things. Maximus, the protagonist, is Django whilst Proximo is Dr Schultz. In addition, the narrative route is largely similar, though it does tend to be in revenge films. However I found that the ending narrative was similar. The audience gets sucked in to believe the protagonist has finally overcome the antagonist and essentially won. Unfortunately in both films it doesn't happen. They essentially start back from the beginning and in the last 20 minutes or so they 'win'. In this sense it could be suggested that both films are a two-part cyclical narrative in which the main part gets them close, but after losing out they take part in a much smaller journey to victory. In Django's case, this would be getting put back into slavery, only to break free and kill the rest of the evil slave owners in Candyland and rescue the girl.Leonardo DiCaprio gives another typical DiCaprio performance with much gusto, intensity and sheer desire, or should I say persistence, in search for his long sought after Oscar Award. Though I think he'd want that in a leading role. I think this is perhaps one of his best roles. He suits the intense, charming yet slightly crazy character. A role which I would say, suits him perfectly. His devotion to the character is second to none and I believe this is his only genuine method acted performance. He blends into Calvin Candy's character with ease and there is the evidence of his devotion to the character in the dining room scene with Django and Dr Schultz in which he cuts his hand quite severely, of which would later require stitches, but stays in his designated role and carries on. It's rather funny if you know this and see Broomhilda's face after Candy wipes his genuine bloodied hand on her face.Jamie Foxx is the only man I can think of for the role of Django, no doubts come into my mind for this characters role as a Jamie Foxx one. I heard Will Smith was being considered and I can only say now, thank God. Will Smith is a comedic, if not heartwarming character and doesn't belong in a serious movie let alone one about slavery. One criticism some would say is that Jamie only plays one dimension throughout the movie, when he makes a witty line, the tone remains the same as when he gave permission to Candy to feed a Mandingo slave to the dogs. On my part, I believe this is due to Django previously being a slave and not being allowed to show any sign of emotion for fear of being beaten or whipped. Or I could just be giving Foxx undeserved credit and shower him in praise even though this could be pure luck for him.The movie itself is good but quite Tarantino. By this I mean, it's too long, too expansive and put simply, too much. Many people have argued that Tarantino's films are revenge films, or spaghetti western's or just indulgent violent comedy. However, in my opinion, this is Tarantino's genre that he is building up himself. He quite clearly has taken ideas from Western expert Sergio Leone, director of the masterpiece that is 'Once Upon a Time in The West', then used the same narrative from every other revenge film e.g 'Gladiator' and finally the indulgent violence which to be honest he brought to fame. These three elements together have created Tarantino's personal genre. I believe that with more practice on his direction and (I'm ashamed to say) screenplay he could make a masterpiece much like 'Reservoir Dogs'. My screenplay issue brings with it many arguments because this is the best feature in his films but unfortunately he brings it too far through his films to suit the narrative. Tarantino must either make the screenplay and mould the narrative into it or plan out the narrative and fit the screenplay into it. Overall, the media attention this movie brings due to the slavery subject stains the movie itself. The movie as a movie is very good until Django gets put back into slavery, at which point the ending is rushed and predictable. The casting director did a wonderful job. The screenplay is good bar the extensive use of the 'n' word. If I could give this movie a specific rating out of 10, it would be 7.5, unfortunately I will have to round up to 8. This film needs improvement and someone, perhaps the producer, to just keep Tarantino contained and don't let him 'Tarantino all over the place' like in 'Inglourious Basterds' with Mike Myers making an appearance.",

The actors and actresses acted very well, and the sets and costumes were well done.The problem I had was the movie became less interesting and more brutal and violent just for the sake of being violent. It didn't enhance the story and actually detracted from it. I found the later half to be somewhat far fetched, and far less entertaining than the first half. I think the movie would have been better with a completely different 2nd half.",

The western setting and the theme of slavery gave Quentin all the opportunity he could wish for to enact another neo-realistic piece of art with no holds barred. First of all, the concept of the black slave who becomes a hero in a setting that many could only have imagined would hold nothing but despair and battery for a black man in that era was totally unexpected. The depictions of the innate desires of the slave masters was well established with no attempt whatsoever to ton down their excesses for the sake of cinema. This leaves the viewer awe-struck and unsure of what to expect next. Though violent, Quentin in his signature neo-realistic representation managed to keep the viewer secretly yearning for more violence in every new scene; with the image of the preceding scene still fresh in the viewer's mind because of the unexpected twist that always brings about the demise of the characters represented. And of course, the western touch always gives room for dramatic gun battles that viewers can never get tired of - reminiscent of old classics from way back such as For a few dollars more and The good, the bad and the ugly.",

Schultz buys and then promises to free Django in exchange for his help in collecting a large bounty on three outlaws.

            "content": "Django Unchained has all the quirkiness you'd expect from a Tarantino movie, seemingly in a constant contrast between ultra violent action and a strange breed of southern civility, with a good bit of humor and cheesiness spread throughout. Django is by no means a sophisticated movie, nor does it try to be, but it certainly has fun. The movie turns a lynch mob into comic relief with perhaps one of the funniest scenes in a Tarantino film, and the way blood gushes out of bullet holes like a geyser is strangely fun to watch ( as morbid as that sounds ) sort of reminiscent of that same giggly feeling I felt watching Uma Thurman Katana break dancing in a mob of tuxedo clad ninja gangsters in Kill Bill Vol. 1, or watching Monkeys wielding LMGs in the Planet of the Apes reboot. That's not to say there isn't some stuff in this movie that is quite cringe worthy, namely a slave who is eaten by dogs and watching two \"Mandingo\" fighters battle to the death with a sadistic Leonardo DiCaprio watching. As far as acting goes, Leonardo DiCaprio nailed his role as slave master, his character, Calvin Candie, was both unsettling and charismatic at the same time sort of emphasizing that weird southern civility built on a foundation of brutality.Christoph Waltz also does a great job as the German bounty hunter Dr. Schultz, and I really enjoyed his relationship with Django, played by Jamie Foxx (another notable performance).I didn't really have too many gripes with this movie, but they're still there. Broomhilda, played by Kerry Washington, is Django's main motive in this movie, but she literally says maybe a paragraph's worth of dialogue at best. Also the transition between Django being an ex- slave and becoming a bad ass bounty hunter isn't all that apparent, you see him collect a few bounties and practice his hand at quick draw with a snowman than he's able to gun down almost twenty cowboys later on in the movie. Django is a good movie, it's by no means Tarantino's magnum opus, but it is still a great film worth seeing, watch it if you can",

Movies done with more drama, and less but carefully selected moments for the humor, are more interesting for me personally. It seems like a lazy way to write, focusing on visuals and absurdities. The moments of drama in DU are very good, and the actors are as well. Then you have the shootouts with blood spraying everywhere, which is for me boring and dumb. QT is writer/director/actor, and much of the focus is on the visual. There are no particular areas that QT is shooting for that are not done pretty well, it's mostly a matter of taste. I wish he would do more stuff similar to the 3 great movies I mentioned earlier. To me QT is making movies that are more fun to direct than to watch,but then this is what some people are after.....That said I will look forward to giving \"Hateful eight a viewing\".

The main protagonist, Django, feels out of place.

Django however is the further thing from a disappointment and Tarantino's GREATEST work ever! DJango is a BRILLIANT film with plenty of laughter, humor, fun, fear, suspense, excitement, love and even the occasional heart break for how character's behave and their motives unveiled. You find yourself truly attached to these characters and really wanting to be close to them on their journey. The actors chosen for these rolls are beyond precise, as they are the absolute PERFECT person, and the film could not have done with out each one of them, and even the smaller rolls bring a great deal to the movie.What people fail to realize about this film, is that its made a historical marking in our cinematic history. This is the first ever movie that a slave, a slave in the South, makes a great rise, and has an actual love story. This is the first love story of a slave in a sense, and while it may not completely center on love at all times, this is all about love and the driving force behind it.",

We wait for the guns to go off, knowing that a life will be snuffed out, and aren't disappointed. The attention to detail in the sets is also remarkable, given that the artistic person passed away during shooting, and his vision taken up by those left to continue. Coupled with an amazing soundtrack, these elements give the film a special feel distinct from the spaghetti westerns other reviewers liken this film to. You'll enjoy the close-ups of faces, as though you're really looking less at a period piece and more at figures summoned up from the antebellum South. That allows the unbroken train of images and story to remain on the viewers mind, although some humor and a bit of overacting may nearly break that train.

But beware, the fans are out in full force claiming \"Masterpiece.\" Before I say much, I want to say this. This movie was great. Moving on, there was quite a bit to be desired. I will start with the content. I love blood and gore as much as the next 30 something QT fan, but you cannot mix fact-based, obscene and disturbing violence against a certain race with humorous, gunshots scenes in the same movie. Pick a theme.Secondly, the acting. Thank you for casting Leo DiCaprio. This saved the movie. Here is why. Christoph Walz played essentially the same character as he did in inglorious bastards. Which was an academy award winning performance so I won't complain. Don Johnson was... well... Don Johnson. Don't expect a career reinventing performance a la Bruce WIllis. Sam Jackson is quite possibly the worst actor in Hollywood. Every time he spoke, I cringed. It was horrible. He played to every stereotype and then some. Jamie Foxx was great. He is usually pretty good in everything he does, but I would say he was exceptional here. The guy has an Oscar for imitating Ray Charles, but he created his own character here and I loved it. Lastly, why in hell was Tarantino is this film!?!?! If you see QT as a good actor, please refrain from ever discussing any film or anything else for that matter with me. Third and most puzzling to me, the pace. The movie seemed to move in and out of scenes with no pace whatsoever. It felt like I was having a discussion with a coke head who could not stay focused. He would just go off on tangents and barely made it back to continue the story. Now I know this is not new for QT, but this was not Pulp fiction. This was not Kill Bill. This was supposed to be a linear story. When you are telling a linear story, your timing and pace needs to be on point. His was not. This was most likely due to Sally Menke's unfortunate passing, leaving his filmed to be edited by anyone other than her for the first time. Overall, I had a great time seeing this movie, as I do all Tarantino flicks. But that is what I am beginning to see them as. Just flicks. They are not cinematic masterpieces, he is not a genius and he is definitely not the greatest director of our generation. He is awesome, but he needed a little more direction here. Had there been more oversight to avoid previously mentioned mishaps (Sam Jackson/QT in an Aussie accent/Timing,) this could have been one of his best. But it wasn't.

There are many movies that the main subject of the film is slavery and the film is not enjoyable to watch, you feel awful about the things that happened to these people and throughout the film you are depressed. This is not the case in Django . In Django you fell happy and excited because no matter what happens to Django he will win, he will get his revenge, he will get his woman, he will kick slavery's ass. The next best thing about this movie is the acting, the acting in this film is superb. Christoph Waltz is fantastic as Dr. Schultz. No one on Earth could done a better job. Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio and all the others were also amazing. The only slight problem with the film is that it is a bit overlong. After the final shootout( which is the greatest part of the film) there is still a large chunk of the movie left, but you kind of don't want it to end. But besides that the film is spectacular.

They are slaves of basic human behavior.Tarantino is a brilliant director. He is the master. The audience serves his will with-out any questions.There is a classic definition of \"desire\". DESIRE = pro attitude towards a proposition.In the end of the movie the audience desires to see helpless woman and old crippled man gunned down by the hero.You can rationalize it by saying that they were not innocent - but it makes no difference. You are still willing to say yes to revenge. Its not just vigilante-justice, but heartless act of murder.This is the goal of the narrative, Tarantino's grand scheme. He has hypnotized the audience to follow his sadistic desires. Then he proposes: Kill them! Show no mercy! And the whole audience laughs and cheers. Practically no-one sees any moral dilemmas when unarmed civilians are executed without trial.At this point the members of audience are just members of a violent mob. They take part to a lynching - just like people willingly took part to lynching in the old days. Nothing has really changed.Viewing this movie in regular theater only shows that practically anyone can be manipulated into murder-frenzy - just as most regular people in Germany was manipulated to believe that the Fuhrer is cool and wise.Its only a matter of medium and style: music and editing. Through the selected narrative we understand who we are supposed to relate to.Tarantino uses similar methods as the Nazis and all dictators have used, to promote his ill values and his chosen hero. After few hours we are on his side and then comes the most shocking fact of human behavior: we accept any horrible crimes our hero takes part in.It is sickening to witness the complete fall of morality in 3 hours.",

Yes, the N-word was used a great deal, but it seemed in context to be realistic and would have been silly without. Yes, some of the violence was shocking. Uh, I think that it is supposed to shock us. I love that the movie is so full of in your face contradictions, juxtapositions, and irony. The sheer audacity of it all. The ridiculousness. The gorgeous but slightly distorted scenery. Partly spoof, and partly homage. I went to see this prepared to be disappointed (seems like every time something is praised highly, I find it disappointing), but I came out and immediately text-ed my friends--I said, \"I just saw the most freaking awesome movie in years!!!\" I don't know that I'm qualified to say this is Tarantino's best, but I will say it is my personal favorite.",

As with all of Tarantino's films, Django moves right along and surprises you at every corner with clever doses of off-center humor to raw expressions of truths on slavery. Tarantino's use of a litany of known actors for seemingly small parts adds to the charm of the story telling. Jamie Foxx executes a fine performance as the unchained slave, however, he serves as a supporting role to the masterful performance of Christoph Waltz.....simply brilliant! Tarantino's cameo performance as an Aussie slave handler was a fun twist, although he won't be getting a nod by the Academy any time soon. The 3 hr film in no way seems too long because of the masterful story telling, editing and film work.

            "content": "Well it's been approximately 39.5 hours since I experienced Tarantino's latest offering and I have not been able to shut up about it.After feeling a touch let down with Tarantino's previous wonderfully titled Inglorious Basterds, I decided to completely erase any negative opinions/thoughts I held with his prior work *cough Kill Bill Vol 2 cough* and to just enjoy the ride and boy did I.Sitting back in my premiere seat and consuming most of my popcorn during the trailers, a tingling burst of excitement ran up my spine as the opening scene began. I found myself slowly placing my popcorn on the ground, eyes fixated on the screen as the 'Django' song blasted through the cinema! The story of Django is one of pain, love and revenge. Django (Jamie Foxx) a former slave is freed by dentist turned bounty hunter Dr King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and taken under his wing on a bloody mission to settle one bounty that could change both of their lives. On the basis that the bounty is settled, Shultz promises Django his freedom and more importantly to help him find his wife who has been taken and sold as a slave to the vile Calvin Candie (Leonardo Dicaprio). The bounty in question requires the heads of three men, three brothers in fact, the Brittle brothers.Now before I saw the movie I was led to believe that the story of the Brittle brothers was the main focus of the film, watching the trailers and so forth. This isn't necessarily true, actually this particular part of the story ended pretty quickly, which perhaps was a little disappointing but enjoyable nonetheless.The second part of the movie introduces Mr Calvin Candie a ruthless and quite honestly nasty piece of work, played as well as possible by Mr Dicaprio, even his southern accent wasn't that bad *Thumbs up* mucho better than his attempt at being a native of Zimbabwe. This being the most important mission for Django to date, he and Shultz devise a plan to buy his wife Broomhilda from Candie with a proposition too good to refuse. Of course, it doesn't go entirely according to plan as the suspicions of one gentleman in particular cause a great deal of anger and stress for Candie. This gentleman being Stephen (Samuel L Jackson), the head slave of the plantation, which by the way is brilliantly named Candyland. Stephen soon realises that in fact the two bounty hunters are here for Broomhilda and will not leave empty handed. What follows is a great deal of guns, blood, carnage and down right muthaf*ckin mayhem! I found the movie to be an absolutely brilliant watch, so much emotion and heartache mixed with enough brutality to keep even the gore whore's out there happy. Focusing a great deal on slavery and the abuse African Americans were put through during this dreadful time, really opens your eyes to a period that many people seem to have forgotten about. I for one found myself researching slavery and really learning about a difficult era that is still visible in society today. The 'N' word is used, I'd say around 500 kazillion times throughout the movie, which can be a little uncomfortable to hear but it was the way black people were wrongly referred to at that time so I think Tarantino did what was relevant and realistic for the period he wanted to portray. Another item I found very uncomfortable watching was a scene involving dogs and one unfortunate soul . . .rarely have I covered my eyes in vomit inducing disgust, well unless Kristen Stewart is on screen :pHighly recommended and an early favourite for film of the year BUT we are only in January peeps!!",

And the use of music is so clever as it is perfectly pitched to be in the style of whichever genre is at the forefront, yet both paying homage and sending up that genre at the same time. I am struggling to find much fault. The worst performance and scenes include the director who for a laugh tries to put on an Australian accent (though at one point it slips into South African).

Although Tarantino has said about Mandingo fighting, \"I was always aware those things existed\", there is no definitive historical evidence that slave owners ever staged gladiator-like fights to the death between male slaves like the fight depicted in the movie. Historian Edna Greene Medford notes that there are only undocumented rumors that such fights took place. David Blight, the director of Yale's center for the study of slavery, said it was not a matter of moral or ethical reservations that prevented slave owners from pitting slaves against each other in combat, but rather economic self-interest: slave owners would not have wanted to put their substantial financial investments at risk in gladiatorial battles.",

And then add a little taste of blaxploitation and voil\u00e1, movie of the year. I mean ... I believe most of the people felt that way about this, but on this movie we see a Tarantino that lost his storytelling skill, in favor of his \"trademarks\". What we have here is a great collection of awesome scenes (and they're really awesome ... that hip hop track was a touch of pure genius), but he doesn't tie them together. Django Unchained is around three hours long, what could have been two if he were a little more respectful to his audience. Waltz shows again his astounding acting skills, but his role is nothing but a big plot device ... he is the deus ex machina! He's the only thing that keeps the story going through the entire movie, although his character lacks depth entirely. Jamie Foxx is perfect for his job too, and shows why he was chosen for this role, but his character is just a big unimpassioned sucker, who you never know if it's just stupid or not ... that because Tarantino chose to put an unfunny plot breaking joke (about his dressing) instead of keeping it real, instead of making the audience feel his pain. I guess Tarantino just couldn't handle the weight of making both a western pasta and a blaxploitation tribute, like he just get's little pieces of each and pray for them to work together (which doesn't). DiCaprio also displays his acting skills perfectly: it's easily ignorable on this film that he is DiCaprio, but he is trapped in another non-explored character. It just feels like Tarantino first decided what scenes to shoot and then how the story should go, and the result is a three hour collection of good ideas that never deliver what the viewer expected. He should get back on doing Jackie Brown or Death Proof.",

The film stars Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson.The film follows an African-American slave (Foxx), and a German bounty hunter posing as a traveling dentist (Waltz), named Dr.Schultz. In exchange for helping Schultz collect a large bounty on three outlaws, Schultz buys and then promises to free Django after they catch the outlaws the following spring. Schultz subsequently promises to teach Django bounty hunting, and split the bounties with him, if Django assists him in hunting down other outlaws throughout the winter. Django agrees on the condition that they also locate and free his long-lost wife (Washington) from her cruel plantation owner Candie (DiCaprio).The film showcases brutal violence and the dark theme of slave trade from the director's perspective. The cinematography is brilliant and the movie is humorous and gruesome at the same time. The first half of the movie is deeply engaging but the second half seemed to lack some vigor.The cast did exceedingly well with special mention of DiCaprio who put life into the character of an exploitative plantation owner. Christoph Waltz portrayal of Dr. Schultz reaffirms my belief in him as a versatile actor. The soundtrack is good enough with its touch of \"The West\" but does not impresses much.

            "content": "By incorporating a multitude of thematic Tarantino elements Django is the best Tarantino movie SINCE Pulp Fiction. Not as good as that great movie since this one is a little more bloated and less novel, it nonetheless is Tarantino's second best movie. This was great because it used many of the best aspects of the other Tarantino films. Such as the friendship between a black and white antihero (a hit-man like in Pulp Fiction but now the male bonding is as bounty hunters), also the violence art similar to Kill Bill and the Gut Warming, heart pounding, pulpy thrill of revenge against an evil like in Inglorious Bastards. There were many other aspects of Tarantino's movie in this one. To start off the complete unpredictability is what really draws you in. You really do not know what is going to happen next which is refreshing to those that frequently see movies. The episodic scenes have such a high degree of unpredictability that it mesmerizingly keeps us on the edge of our seats.There were some really amazing characters created which was not wholly due to the writer/director but the great actors who infused their talent into the roles. These characters' eccentricities were so unique that you might have never seen characters like this before. A trademark oddity in how they spoke, what they said and their ultimate actions reflected without any creative barriers the moviemaker's soul. If you thought Christopher Waltzes and Jamie Foxx's character were great wait till you get to DiCaprios and Samuel L Jacksons. You really wanted to see more of these characters despite the nearly 3 hour length of this Tarantino epic. Dicaprio's character was probably the best; he was so amusing with his warped, semi-depraved, megalomaniac eccentricity. DiCaprios acting was really good here too. Samuel L Jackson can blurt out the necessary profanities with the appropriate rawness making him the perfect actor for some of Tarantino's parts.The greatest thing is the psychological aspects to these characters and how that plays out in the scenes. There is actually a lot of psychology going on which builds multi-dimensional characters and creates scenes of intense unpredictability. There were other scenes of brilliant hilarity mocking the dark side of the old south, or genre film itself. As the movie progressed and where it could have ended well and uniquely alas a contrived scene was thrown in to showcase Tarantino's signature brand of violence art, reminiscent of Kill Bill. This weakened the movie as a whole and made it drag however it was pure fun to witness the slow motion blood splattering and detailed depiction of body parts being shot with blood shooting out like geysers drenching the place in red.I think I heard Tarantino is criticized for rehashing old movies or copying from other films. I guarantee whether or not that is the case you've never seen something like this before.",

Jackson I gotta say this one was a bit over the top making him seem more like a cartoon villain.But all these things are just eclipsed by the story (which is awesome),the performance by Leonardo di Caprio ,Jammie Fox(when he gets under the characters skin) and especially Christoper Walts's character.To summarize,this movie is awesome but I wouldn't advise you to watch it with the kids or on a date.

            "content": "Django Unchained is Quentin Tarantino's most recent movie; it borrows many elements from Tarantino's predecessor, Inglorious Basterds, while still remaining an original movie. Tarantino brings all his usual elements to the table. There is an over the top amount of violence, but is presented in an often darkly humorous way. Also the cast is riddled with typical Tarantino cast, Samuel L. Jackson, Christoph Waltz have both been in a few Tarantino movies, Jackson has appeared in at least six other movies, also Tarantino has tried to cast Leonardo DiCaprio in other roles, but due to scheduling conflicts they had never been able to work together until now. But it is a very good thing it finally worked out. DiCaprio makes a very good antagonist, even though he is usually on the other end of the spectrum. DiCaprio was so in character that the scene where he breaks the glass on the table out of anger was real. He sliced his hand open and stayed in character, smearing his own blood on Broomhilda's face. Leonardo DiCaprio deserved to finally win his Oscar for his performance in this movie. Personally I feel it is his best performance since his acting in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. DiCaprio was not the only member to have such a strong performance. Christoph Waltz used his skills to create such an easily likable character in Dr. Shultz. He is a kind and caring German doctor, but also a ruthless bounty hunter who sees the world as it is. His ability to switch to being so ruthless, while still retaining his German charm is truly endearing. His performance was truly Oscar worthy. That's not to say the rest of the cast was terrible, every member was cast well, and played their parts to the letter. Their performances together, weaving together the humor, violence, and the dark despair in the movie, creates a fantastic blend on the hero's story of revenge and daring rescue. The writing of Django is brilliant, from Dr. King Schultz gentle and kind demeanor, to the hilarious but entirely loyal butler Stephen, the script is exceptionally well written. All of the director's trademarks are here in this movie; Tarantino fans will not be disappointed. As soon as the opening credits start to roll and the Django song can be heard, fans will be very glad. Tarantino also includes some of his other favorite trademarks, such as his classic zooms on new character's faces, random segments of music that do not make any sense given the movie, his over the top violence, and Tarantino's small acting cameo's that can be all found in his classics. The soundtrack that goes along with it is phenomenal. It has such a diverse play list, it has everything from rap to country, to instrumental almost classical sound. It would seem like an odd mix, but Tarantino makes it truly shine. Django Unchained is a western, but it is much different from the traditional Clint Eastwood types that come to mind. Tarantino breathes a breath of fresh air into a genre that is not as popular as it once was. Django Unchained is not for everyone though; it uses an obscene amount of racial slurs, gory violence, and is all about the satisfaction of revenge. Many people will probably be turned off by the N-word being thrown around over one hundred times, or because people's heads get shot off. But that is what makes Django Unchained such a great movie, it is not for everyone. People should hate it, because it takes place in a dark time in American history, right before the Civil War and it spares no expense on showing the cruelty slaves had to endure. The film was not even allowed to be shown in China until some serious censoring happened. All in all this is a fantastic movie, it is a must see for any Tarantino fan out there. New comers are welcome as well, it is a good starting place for people who are not familiar with his work. Be warned though, once you find you enjoy his movies, you will have to watch the rest of his films, but I promise that that is the best thing that could happen to you.",

Sadly, as Stephen pointed out many slaves had experienced the same treatment through his years at the plantation. Ultimately, it is only through movies such as this that the modern day person (of any color)can understand and even witness the true cruelty associated with slavery. Being of white descent, I was horrified at what I saw and found myself asking, \"Why don't they just kill these SOB's!?!?!? You outnumber them--team up and kick their a****\".

I think it's excellent how the gore and excessive use of the n word portray what slavery was really like. In all honesty, some parts i had to turn away, but if i were standing right in front of those scenes in person 150 years ago I would still be looking away. This move shows the truth. then again, it also shows the unlikely event of a slave rising up and taking the best revenge for him and his wife humanly possible. I laughed, held backed tears, and winced. This story holds nothing back. Old ladies in the audience with me were intrigued and one said to me as i got back from the bathroom \"pretty intense huh?\" Yes. very intense. I'm sorry i got up twice and missed a few minutes of this glorious movie. Don't miss it.",

By the time the movie ended I wanted to watch it again. This movie is not for the faint of heart as it has some extremely graphic scenes. Over there is only one word to adequately describe this movie, entertaining. Hats off the Christoph Waltz whose character was really the cherry on top of an excellent movie.

Secondly the storyline is far too weak and does not do justice to the weight of the genre or indeed the whole deep seated racism that existed in that era. With his last work Inglorious Basterds we had that beauty of a story line to work with - killing loads of Nazis and the carrot at the end of the stick - Hitler himself! From a casting perspective it was so so. I would have to agree with the above column that Samuel L. 's role is the high point with Christoph Waltz coming in a close second.

I can see that time, effort and dollars were spend on this one. However, the movie fails where it tries to be witty, funny, surprising, clever or anything above-good whatsoever.The film has a few main problems. First, the problem is not the lenght itself but the way time is spend. There are some scenes which are way too long and some which are brief yet effective. If this is supposed to be an action movie, the emphasis should be on the action. I understand the attempts to create suspension and atmosphere when I see them, yet sadly I comprehend when such attempts have failed. If you have seen other Tarantinos, you know how scenes with evil people givin'lengty speeches will turn out. Perhaps a die-hard fan of T. experiences predictable events worthy of attention, but I just got bored. There is no pleasure in story which is both obvious and badly told.Second, the movie has nothing new or innovative to give. As a huge fan of B-movies I expected something fresh out of this - just the way those real cheaply made flicks deliver. But Django stands empty. Violence, profanities and atrocities are poor content for a movie as such. Django invents nothing new to the genre. I admit I even laughed out loud a few times, something I rarely do in cinema, but mostly felt as if I was just wasting my time. N-words, swearing and racism are funny only that far.If you want to see a film with little action and a simple story, sure, go watch this one. If you love spotting calculatedly positioned spoofs, sure watch this. But don't except nothing you have not seen before, or anything done with a big heart. This is a product comparable to Disney or Pixar animations: you know beforehand what you will see and afterwards you will know your expectations were right.",

There wasn't any time during the movie I was bored the first hour I kept giggling like a little school girl - by the amazing one liners that Waltz was making - the humor lasted throughout the entire movie - and the plot was not important at all, just the amazing approach of Tarantino made this work excellent!How to sell this movie to someone that has not seen it yet?

All is legal because whites are criminals which are wanted death or alive by the government. Why did Django venture to start such career? Of course he makes it not from of racial revenge.

Jamie, Christopher, Leonardo and last but not least, Samual Jackson were all memorable performances. Thats an homage to their abilities but also the director and writer. I can understand why actors want to work with him. He brings out the best.I know the film has been under fire for the violence and the use of the \"N\" word. If I had 1 criticism is that in a couple of scenes, I do think that the violent visuals are too much. I know I don't get the point why they are over the top. B movies tend to be over the top sometimes. When it came to some of the scenes on how the slaves are treated, I don't how you can gloss over that.

The whole story was OK because it's the usual \"I have to save my woman no matter what\" which is acceptable to me. I am not a professional critic so sorry if I am too vague. The movie seemed empty because the story was a bit short but acceptable. Christopher Waltz was incredible with his comedical/clever ways. Samuel L. Jackson was also good as usual. I didn't like the fact that HE was the one to rat out Django when Dr.Schultz and Django where trying to get Django's wife. The action in this movie was an 8/10 because of the special weapons used in this movie and the previously described \"bad-assery\" of Django. The blood, although, was ridiculous.Instead of just a hole with some blood, blood spurts out like a volcano (many characters get shot multiple times so get ready for a blood bath). The soundtrack was o.k because some of the songs where inappropriate. Not in the sense of sex,drugs or violence encouraged but because of how \"modern\" or \"unrelated\" the song was. There is some nudity in this movie so watch out.The comedy in this movie is OK. The realism applied to how the south was right before the civil war was a bit accurate.

By this time I was bored and fed up, which wasn't helped by a terrible directorial cameo.

What began as a film about a white and black man working together (in the setting of a time in which racial equality was not commonplace) as bounty hunters ended up being about not giving up on love, too. Though a bit drawn out at times, the classic humor embedded in Tarantino's films was not lost among the blood and explosions that we expect when associating a film with the legendary man mentioned previously.

Prior to viewing 'Django: Unchained', 'Pulp Fiction' was by far my favourite film of his, but after watching this, I'm just not sure.Let me start by saying that the premise of the film is excellent. A slave turned gunslinger on a quest for revenge. Tarantino is no stranger to the revenge flick genre following 'Kill Bill', but I can't say that I've ever seen a film of this nature executed in a more brilliant and beautiful way than 'Django: Unchained'.A huge factor in this film's success was the incredible and often spellbinding performances of some of the picture's stars. In particular, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz stole the show. Jamie Foxx, as 'Django', put in a very solid performance, as did Kerry Washington, but neither could begin to compete with the impeccable and thrilling performances that this trio put in. Every single line, and every movement they made contributed to the acting masterclass boasted in this movie.Overall, 'Django: Unchained' is not just a mindless action movie. It is a great film with a great story and great actors, and of course, the classic over-the-top violence that comes with every Tarantino flick. Yes there are many historical inaccuracies, and often many surreal moments that may leave the viewer thinking to themselves: 'That would never happen!'

Now, you have my attention.\" Django Unchained, a film directed by Quentin Tarantino, is about Django, played by Jamie Foxx, a slave-turned-bounty-hunter, who travels the Deep South in search for his slave wife. He travels alongside another bounty hunter who saved his life, named Dr. King Schultz, played by the German actor Christoph Waltz, who was also Colonel Hans Landa in Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds. The two heroes are forced to battle it out with a big-shot plantation owner, Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his head of the house slave, Stephen, who is portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. Django Unchained is widely regarded as Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction. Tarantino's 2012 feature is a high-octane, adrenaline fueled thrill-ride, which is driven powerfully by a star-studded cast, amazing plot, and fast-paced, western style gun slinging, that will leave the viewer in awe.Everything from casting, to the characters themselves, to the beautifully written dialogue, makes the film roll; however, the story of Django Unchained truly pulls this cinematic beauty together.In the words of Dr. King Schultz, \"Now, normally I would say \"Auf wiedersehen,\" but since what \"auf wiedersehen\" actually means is \"'till I see you again\", and since I never wish to see you again, to you, sir, I say goodbye.\"",

            "content": "Django Unchained is the latest film by Quentin Tarantino. It is fantastic, If not controversial. Tarantino really does pick a controversial subject but he pulls it off in typical Tarantino fashion. The film centres around Django (Jamie Foxx) a slave who meets Doctor King Schultz (Waltz)and agrees that if he helps Schultz out he will be given his freedom, But as the film goes on we find out Django has a wife who is still enslaved and he then tries to find his wife which leads him to brutal slaver Calvin Candie (Di Caprio)and Lets just say it doesn't go too well for Django. The acting as expected from a Tarantino film is top notch with a stand out performance from Waltz. Overall Django Unchained is a solid, violent extremely watchable movie which could well be Tarantino's masterpiece, my only complaint is the over use of the \"N\" word but if you can see past this minor flaw Django Unchained is like I said Awesome.",

I am not a fan of Jamie fox (Django) but he did the role very well and convinced me by his acting. Samuel Jackson as usual very effective in the movie and did the role can't be better than that, Christoph Waltz make his role very good, I like all the songs and music in the movie, It can make me live the time of the movie (1858), It's a perfect movie and I couldn't give less than 10/10 for the rate.

Dicaprio is flawless and Waltz is my favorite. After seeing other Westerns this movie may be a cause for disappointment, this movie does not behave like a western.

Even as a young black woman with regard to the gratuitous use of the n-word, the movie challenged me to confront what it is I feel about a word I use but would dare someone else to use. And though our lead actor was snubbed at the Oscars, I give him all the accolades one man can get. He showed range in emotion that we have never seen before. He showed skills we did not know he had. Furthermore, he used restraint. Instead of over-acting, he made us wonder. Bravo, Quentin! Great choice. Not to mention, Leonardo (whom I love) made me hate him. Bravo! This movie took us on a journey of great scenery, situational characters, revenge, growth, and best of all love. Tarantino has given me everything! Thank you.",

            "review_title": "A New Kind of Western Movie",
            "content": "Ever since Quintin Tarantino came out with his movie Inglorious Basterds, he left his fan base wanting more. They wanted a Western adventure movie with two memorable lead characters, and they got exactly what they were asking for with the release of Tarantino's newest movie Django Unchained. Django Unchained is a movie that has redefined what it means to be a modern day Western movie. Nobody, not even Tarantino, could have guessed that this Western-Adventure/Drama would have been such a hit with today's public! With the remarkable plot, intense writing of the script, outstanding acting, and the sprinkles of comedy placed in throughout the movie, Django Unchained is definitely a movie for the record books. The movie starts out in 1858 with the main character of the movie, Django, played by actor Jamie Foxx. Django starts out as a slave that was being moved along by two slavers when the supporting character, Dr. King Shultz, comes in. Dr. King Shultz is a German bounty hunter portrayed by Christopher Waltz (best known for his role in Inglorious Basterds as Col. Hans Landa). Dr. King Shultz finds Django and buys his freedom in exchange for some help with finding three criminals named the Brittle Brothers. Now the stage is set for a duo like no other. They track down the Brittle Brothers, find them, and then kill them. After this Django and the Dr. are discussing what Django is going to do with his new freedom. Django tells him that he plans on finding his wife Broomhilda Von Shaft (played by Kerry Washington). After hearing this, Dr. King Shultz gives Django an option to work with him, collecting bounties through the winter. Soon after the winter is over they find out that Broomhilda was sold to Calvin J. Candie, (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), and was brought to his plantation that is watched over by the \"head slave\" Stephen (played by Samuel L. Jackson). The rest of the movie is all about how Django and Dr. King Schultz work together, crafting a plot, to get into Candie land and save Broomhilda. The movie itself was phenomenal, and that's not just my opinion. The critics also agree, and in 2013 awarded the movie Django Unchained an Oscar for the Best Writing, Original Screenplay and a Golden Globe for Best Screenplay \u2013 Motion Picture. As far as acting is concerned, each individual actor's interpretation of their character is jaw dropping with how real the movie ends up becoming. Some of the actors actually did give their blood, sweat, and tears into this movie. Seen by DiCaprio in the scene at the dinner table when he smashes a wine glass with his hand. The fact that he never broke character with his bloody hand is astounding. As well, the scenery, the composition of the script, and the way each actor/actress delivered their lines, you were instantly transported into the year 1858. The fact that Tarantino was not afraid to insert the \"n word\" into the movie on multiple (and fitting) occasions really added to the feel of the time period you were in while watching the movie. To make the movie a little better, and just a little less serious, it also has a few dashes of humor in it as well. Some of it is obvious, while further humor is hidden under the characters and scenes. Everything about this movie just screams extraordinary. Seeing this movie was an amazing experience, and I share it with my friends every chance I get. And I can promise you, that if the movie alone won't leave you loving it, the ending of it will leave you more than satisfied.",

Schultz buys Django and offers him his freedom if he assists him in his tasks. after befriending Schultz Django tells him of his life's goal and purpose to gain the freedom of his beloved wife Broomhilda ( Kerry Washington), so they set of on an epic journey filled with love, sacrifice, and a whole lot of heart stopping action packed moments which at times feels more like a roller-coaster than a movie.Director Quinten Tarantino has never been known as a conventional director, but Django Unchained truly leaves viewers( or shall I say riders) baffled. It is the sense of absolute oddity that seems to attract the masses. The movie is at sometimes funny, and crude and at others it is heartfelt, and dramatic, but it is always fast paced and entertaining.This Homogenous mix of genres along with the superb performance of the actors truly makes this movie a refreshing breath of fresh air that brigs new life to the once stale western theme.",

Music as present and original as usual, like most Tarantino movies, you could watch the movie blindfolded and still enjoy the experience. And the slavery approach to the movie is what brought this Tarantino movie to the Oscars, like Inglorious Basterds before it: a tough historical and serious touch that makes this something more than just another bad ass movie. It's seriously bad ass historical movie... Something the Academy can enjoy and not feel ashamed to admit it in public.

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino writes and directs this stylish western, a genre that he has applied dashes to in previous films such as Kill Bill but never fully tackled. From the opening scene you able to tell this a Tarantino film as it has his trademark signatures all over it from the stylized violence to riveting dialogue. Django is played excellently by Jamie Foxx, starting off a quite and timid slave and by the end transformed into a ruthless bounty hunter. However it is the supporting characters that steal the show, in particular Christoph Waltz playing a German bounty hunter who frees Django and leads him on his quest. The delivery of his dialogue could be compared to poetry in that it is engaging and sophisticated. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a performance like no other he has done before, playing the villain of the film he delivers terrifying monologues that will have you on the edge of your seat. Sam Jackson, as always in a Tarantino film, does a great job playing the not so typical slave, some might even argue he isn't one as he is granted so much power and is often associating and working with DiCaprio's character.Tarantino's direction, like always is amazing, the film is well paced especially considering that it runs for almost 3 hours! I left the theatre wanting more. The shots in the film are so well composed you could almost pause the film at anytime and it would make for a great poster. Violence is something Tarantino is well-known for and that is no exception for Django Unchained it is very over the top in the action scenes however in the more controversial and disturbing scenes it is dealt with a lot more seriously, still very violent but not as ridiculous. The films music is a variety of many stereotypical western music and modern day rap, however it is used effectively and does not seem out of place. Tarantino's writing creates for an exceptionally original story that will have you interested from start to end. The dialogue, again like always with Tarantino is sophisticated and engaging which creates for many scenes with very little action yet it does not leave you unsatisfied. The characters that are created all have layers and do not seem bland or boring but come across as authentic and inventive. Furthermore, Tarantino sprinkles his sense of humour through out the film creating for some very funny scenes, one in particular that features Jonah Hill as a cameo.In conclusion this is another Tarantino classic in the making featuring a truly original story and many great performances in particular Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio. It also has some of the best dialogue in recent years and combine that with brilliant Tarantino action you are in for one great ride.",

Django Unchained has a perfect mix of drama and action with an awesome display of characters psychology.Tarantino takes to the theme of slavery prevalent in America in the past.However for the first time, Tarantino lays stress on the story of a single character named Django. The movie follows the same theme throughout.The movie portrays how a black slave takes his revenge from his white masters for his oppression and also ensures freedom for his wife. The dialogs are well written and builds up our interest in the movie.Schultz's dialog delivery and the perfect usage of words gives the movie a tinge of humor. His casual accent to different situations is quite impressive. However the most interesting parts in the movie is the level of unpredictability at various scenes in the movie.One may be expecting usual course of events but things turn up differently which maintains our interest in the movie.Though , the movie is a bit long (about 3 hours) ,the dramatic and violent scenes keeps us deeply engrossed and makes the movie an enjoyable experience.There are some really awesome characters in the plot and what is more appealing is the psychological traits and acting of each character separately. One would already be pretty impressed by characters of Django and Schultz , when Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes to the picture and increases our amazement .DiCaprio has specifically lived his role and impressed us with his performance.Even at the end , story would have ended peacefully , but Tarantino ends it in style with a blend of action and violence.Tarantino's movie generally involves some violence, which is also evident in Inglorious Bastards and Kill Bill, and this movie is no exception. The movie highlights various features of Tarantino's movies including the violence and a fight against the evil.Django Unchained is essentially a drama movie,a bit long one, completely engrossed with violence and action.

Django and Dr. Schultz encounter many adventures along their bounty hunting trip to Candy Land and cause a lot of controversy by having Django riding a horse and having freedoms that black people during that time period did not have. The unusual duo finally encounter Mr. Calvin Candy(Leonardo DiCaprio) and instead of just saying they would like to by Broomhilda they devise a story about how they are into Mandingo fighting and are interested in buying some of Mr. Candy's slaves. Needless to say, the duo's intentions are figured out by Mr. Candy's head slave and a battle ensues causing a lot of death. In the end, Django gets his wife Broomhilda free and they ride off together. This film, much like \"Twelve Years a Slave\", shows some of the hardships that African American slaves faced on southern plantations in the U.S. prior to the Civil War. The film shows how salves were forced to fight to the death of either themselves or their component, and then when they were \"no longer able to win fights\" they were killed themselves. The film also shows the horrible ways that slaves were tortured for disobeying rules or running away. For example, one slave was eaten alive by dogs for trying to run away and Broomhilda was locked into a small metal box without food or water and expected to survive in there for ten days as punishment for running away. The use of camera angles zooming in on the faces of the characters to show raw emotions during some of the more gruesome scenes in the film was done perfectly and really helped to tell the story in a compelling way. The use of sound effects also played a large role on the film by allowing the audience to hear the clear sounds of the dogs gnashing their teeth at the slaves who have run away and the quick snaps of the whips used. This film does a good job telling its story of vengeance and good triumphing evil while also giving a glimpse of the horrible sufferings that slaves once endured in our country.",

An interesting, at times funny and very violent movie. Of course violence serves its purpose, as you can have a clue of what black people were going through back in the mid 19th century.The filming is great, so is acting. I also enjoyed the soundtrack. However I found the movie a bit boring, especially as it lasted more than 2,5 hours. Some scenes could be missing, some others could be shortened, without making the movie worse. The exactly opposite. I was between 7 and 8. However I decided to rate it with 7, as I don't fell like seeing it again.",

The acting in it was fantastic both of the protagonist Jaime Foxx and Christoph Waltz gave a performance for the ages, and the antagonist wow, Leo strikes back and actually it was kinda funny seeing him as the bad guy for once which I gotta say was an incredible deliver from him.The story was beautiful with amazing dialogue, the photography was outstanding and I loved how they did some little tributes to the classic western movies which you see in the beginning and when they tell you where the characters are. But to top the amazing story the amazing acting the amazing dialogue we had probably the best soundtrack I've ever heard. Oh my, the movie got me dancing every part of it, the songs were placed right where they had to be. With all that said hands down to Mr. Tarantino for making one of the greatest films of this century.",

Leonardo DiCaprio takes the stage with one of the best performances in his outstanding career, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats every single time he is on screen. Jamie Foxx gives the performance of his career as Django, and is perhaps the most underrated performance of this film, shadowed by Leo and Cristoph. He seems fierce, focused, and intimidating. He was the perfect casting choice for this movie. Beyond these three magnificent actors, this movie features Samuel L. Jackson, which speaks for itself. The action is riveting, bloody, and done very masterfully. The score is glorious, from Luis Bacalov's 'Django' to open the movie, to Franco Micalizzi's 'Trinity (Titoli)' at the bookend, this movie is packed full of great tracks that will only add to these wonderfully-crafted scenes and performances.These performances, Tarantino's directing, and the awesome soundtrack all combine to create perhaps the greatest film Tarantino will ever make, and deserves to be one of the most memorable movies of the past few decades.",

This movie is wild as most of Tarantino's work and it clearly is a revenge story of a black slave getting back on the white slaveholders a topic he sort of addresses in Hateful Eight. Jamie Fox and Waltz are an incredible duo with great chemistry as they around killing people left and right, of course Waltz's presence is strong with his signature charisma. Leonardo Dicaprio dazzles as Candy a white sophisticated slave holder who plays good manors until he reveals the darker side of himself and is terryfing. This movie is fun even as it offends with the repeated use of the n word, and gory violence. Django is a likeable character and we cheer for him as he sets out on his journey. I cannot forget to mention the smaller but significant role of Sam Jackson as a slave serving Candie who's actually in support of slavery and racist himself and hates Django, a cringy role but one where Jackson delivers in a memorable performance. An academy award winning screenplay with great performances and great direction by Tarantino this might be one of my favorite tarantino films.",

From the cinematography to the slight comedic relief at times, I knew this film wasn't going to have the typical slave narrative we've been accustomed to. The film did a decent job at touching on the dynamic between white and Black people during the 1800's. The first scene between Django and Dr. Schultz, with Dr. Schultz buying Django from the slave owner, we see the beginning of what seems to be another \"white savior\" narrative. I was quickly mistaken when realizing that throughout the movie Dr. Schultz might've played the role as someone \"saving\" Django, but ultimately only served as a catalyst in Dango's journey to save his lover. The relationship between the two characters is mutual in that Dr. Schultz uses Django to find the Brittle Brothers and Django uses Dr. Schultz to find his way back to his love, Broomhilda. One character that stood out to me the most was Sheba. She's a Black woman in Mr. Candie's home. Unlike the other Black women/salves, she's bejeweled from head to toe, dressed in elaborately rich clothing, all while sipping  alcohol from the upstairs bar. Her name, Sheba, is a reference to the Queen of Sheba from the Old Testament in the Bible. Sheba means \"is very rich\" and stood out to me because it's also a reference to Ethiopian literature. Additionally, throughout the film we see the cinematography used when zooming into characters from a wide angle and quickly into a close shot, we also follow the character arc of Django who was once a slave, soon become a free man, and later save his love all while defying the odds of what it meant to be a Black man at the time.",

            "content": "My first time watching Django Unchained was last week. The movie deals with a lot of different issues such as slavery, gruesome violence, and race for example. When I first watched it, there were some scenes that I found to be disturbing. I find that Tarantino over-use of the n-word in his films, and not just this particular film, can come off as offensive for some. But within this particular film, because of the historical time-period the movie was set in, the use of the n-word was said on a daily basis. Reminds me that there are certain people that can't say the word in today's society.\u00a0 Freedom here is a major theme. In my opinion, the theme of being a white savior was also present in the film. It is this false belief or implying that African-Americans need white people to \"save them\" or to \"rescue them\" in order for them to have a better life. In my opinion, the character Dr. King Schultz played that role a little bit when he freed Django. Towards the end of the movie, we see that Django has gained the knowledge and skills that were taught by Schultz once he died, to go rescue his wife and Django being able to live as a a man without Schultz. There are a few things I think the film does well on and what the film doesn't do so well. One strength of the film is that the cinematography was so captivating and every little detailed was seen. There was a scene where one of the slave owners was shot by Django and we see the slave owners blood splattered onto the white cotton. This movie reminded me of a slave getting revenge on their slave owners and taking back their freedom. One weakness I thought the film could have done better was the way Broomhilda's character was portrayed. She was more of a physical entity as we can see from her being abused and sexually assaulted. There were other woman character's that had a different role, but I do wonder if she wasn't Django's wife, would Broomhilda still have gone through what she went through? Overall, I would recommend to watch this movie to others.",

Though a western film, Django isn't a cowboy hero, rather a free slave anti-hero. He's neither good nor bad, but is a steadfast individual who ends up learning a whole lot from the German bounty hunter who freed him. The only thing he wants back is his beloved wife, but ends up facing brutal violence, harsh negotiating, and formidable plantation owners. The fiery revenge in Django's attitude throughout the film gives the feeling that he might explode at any given second, yet he somehow fastens it to a leash. He is an attentive, patient, yet zealous man slowly making his way from the bottom to the top. The use of wide angle filming in this movie captures every bit of vivid landscape imaginable in 19th century Texas, giving the viewers a deeper appreciation for Tarantino's masterful filming in which he habitually displays. Really can't say much more than this. Just watch it now.",

One of the things is how the director used old legends to foreshadow the events that eventually unfolded at the end of the film. This happens when the german dentist told Django the story of Broomhilda, which is a character in the most popular old German legend. \nAnother thing that makes the movie amazing is the beautiful cinematography along with the music. It immerses the audience and makes them feel like they are part of the adventures of Django. The movie also has an interesting take on the social commentary as it highlights the issue of slavery. It does this not only by portraying the mistreatment of African Americans but also by showing that some slaves like being obedient to a master or \"the white man\" because it has been embedded in their minds that slavery is something that can not go away and is here to stay. This gives rise to an interesting argument about the character of Samuel L Jackson. It makes the audience question whether the character is mistreating Django because he has been washed by the system or is he just an evil character. \n\tFinally, the film takes an interesting take on who the antagonist is. This is because unlike other films(such as Inglourious Basterds which is also directed by Tarantino) where the whole movie from the beginning to the end builds up to fight the antagonist, as this movie progresses, the antagonist changes, and Django finds himself fighting new enemies. Overall, I would give this film a 5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Charming, charismatic, heroic. Not the words I thought I'd ever use to describe a movie with slavery, violence, gore, and nudity, but Quentin Tarantino has without a doubt made one of the best movies of the decade with Django Unchained. Jamie Foxx plays Django, a daring ex-slave, who teams up with a bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz, played by Christopher Waltz, to rescue his enslaved wife. First off, I have to say that I have never seen Jamie Foxx this charismatic in any role prior or since, he hits every note of his character perfectly, Django is tough and gritty, rash but methodical, smart but inexperienced. And every aspect of that character shows in Foxx's flawless performance. Christopher Waltz, as well, is incredibly charming, and downright loveable as the lethal but principled German doctor/bounty hunter. Leonardo DiCaprio as the plantation owner Calvin Candie manages to perform his heart out in what should've been an Oscar nomination, I mean that whole bit about Frenology was hands down brilliant. The fact is, it is Tarantino's ability to not only write his characters with remarkable depth, but also give the actors the freedom to perform to their heart's content, that fleshes out and completes many facets of the film that would be otherwise empty. Tarantino can be, as usual, a bit overindulgent, there are a number of scenes not relevant to the plot that if deleted, would have ended about ~30-40 minutes earlier. However, I'd also argue that the extra runtime grants each actor more time to shine and by proxy make the overall film better. \nSpeaking of indulgent, the classic Tarantino violence is just as prevalent in Django Unchained, revolver shots blow body parts off and launch people into the air with spectacular blood, smoke and sound. Yet the violence in this film is also more restrained, more conservative and less gratuitous than many of Tarantino's other movies, likely because he smartly sticks with the use of simple handheld revolvers and pistols for the most part. With Tarantino's signature R-rated style, some of the best performances by the best actors of the decade, and a classic (yet new) Western plot that does not hold back even a drop of blood and sweat, Django Unchained is a downright brilliant film, and one of Tarantino's absolute best. It 100% deserves to be seen again, and again, and again.",

Another reason why the duration never drags is because at the end of the day Django Unchained (2012) covers many different genres and offers up avenues for different audiences to enjoy.

Foxx and Waltz carry this film, though DiCaprio, Johnson, and L. Jackson are also absolutely fantastic in their roles. I feel like the film is unnecessarily over-the-top in terms of its violence, depicting an unbelievably high amount of blood and gore that just does not seem needed. I can also see some people getting offended by the insanely high amounts of racial slurs against African Americans said in this film, though it does have a positive message about equality in it.

            "content": "To me a Django Unchained seemed like an already amazing movie, combining the Western with Quentin Tarantino's film-making, and I was right. The movie is classic of Tarantino, violent and edging onto humorous. The trouble with this one is that it had to carefully cover the theme with slavery which it did fairly well. The movie followed Django, a slave, killing various white slave owners as a bounty hunter by the side of a German outlaw to eventually reunite with his wife, still trapped as a slave. What stands out in this movie was the characters as most of them were unique and well-acted. Christopher Waltz was funny and drove the movie for me and the villain of Leonardo DiCaprio was similarly amusing. The action throughout the movie was in classic Tarantino fashion, over the top to the extent of it being laughable, exactly what I was expecting and it fitted fairly well into the revisionist frame. I feel what the movie occasionally struggled with was the development of its lead, Django played by Jamie Foxx. Foxx is a great actor but I feel like his character wasn't fleshed out at all, and his portrayal in the movie was more as a simple man looking for revenge. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if this was so directly addressed by the direction but it became a hinderance when compared with the other characters, instead serving as some kind of stark contrast of characters which arguably could have worked well. Overall, I think this movie fits well into the revisionist Western sub-genre and serves as a great addition to Tarantino's collection of great movies. If you're a fan of Westerns you should probably watch this, and if you're a fan of Tarantino, even more so.",

He doesn't just want to rescue his wife, he also wants to treat badly the people who treats badly the blacks. We see how he wants to take a revenge on the people that harmed her wife, but also many other black people. Also, it's a real Tarantino work and you can see it. There is violence, but the violent scenes are really well-done except you can't eat in front of them. The blood is everywhere. The camera work is extraordinary.

After watching this film I definitely agree with him.\nHe showed all his ability to tell American history in a grotesque way that hits everyone who's wathcing the film. He received tons of critics due the extreme violence which is present in the entire film. I love that instead. I think that's necessary for the film, it wouldn't be that impressive otherwise. But let's introduce the plot. Basically the movie deals with the story of a slave, called Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx), who got saved by the doctor King Schuktz (Christopher Waltz), a German bounty hunter, then they started to work together and they also became friends. They became so close that Schultz accepted to help Django to save his wife, Broomhilda(Kerry Washington). She was a slave who worked in Candyland, property of Calvin J. Candy ( Leonardo Di Caprio), a freak who forced his slaves in brutal deadly fights. Schultz and Django made up a scam to liberate Broomhilda, but Mr. Candy wasn't that stupid. Earlier I talked about Tarantino's great skills but I said nothing about the actors, so I'm gonna do it right now. Jamie Foxx's such a badass and he's perfect in Django's role. Leo Di Caprio is Leo Di Caprio, you know, one of the best actors on the planet. I bet you all know that in the scene when he got angry because he discovered the scam he actually cut off his hand when he broke the glass and he kept acting despite of that! Those two was great, but in my opinion the best was Christopher Waltz, his acting was amazing. I recommend everybody to watch this film.",

While Django Unchained is profane, provocative and raunchy, it also demonstrates an ability to unravel America's legacy of slavery through a suspenseful plot. \n\nWhat makes Django Unchained so great is its ability to combine various different film genres into one movie. It fits revisionist western, adventure, romance, dark comedy and drama genres. Tarantino's use of dark comedy and violence in Django Unchained and his other movies resembles Stanley Kubrick's style, particularly in A Clockwork Orange. Both Tarantino and Kubrick's movies could fit countless genres as they capture the archetype of conflict between good and evil. \n\nThe cinematography is excellent, and the film does a strong job of capturing the slaves' perspectives. The first harrowing moments of the film show slaves walking all day with sweat dripping all over their faces and limping with huge cuts on their backs. Then the film takes off with a bloody moment 7 minutes in (a Tarantino classic). Right away, the audience is shocked by close-up shots of the inhumane conditions Django and the other slaves had to endure. \n\nBoth main characters in Django Unchained want something: Dr. Schultz, a bounty hunter, wants the financial reward of killing outlaws, and Django just wants to rescue his wife from slavery. The film's social commentary aims to answer this question: What do humans need to be happy? One can see this theme through the journeys of the characters. Calvin Candie (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) gains false happiness through evil means such as exploiting other people, while Django seeks the true happiness of love.\n\nDr. Schultz foreshadows the plot when he explains an ancient German fairytale to Django. The story is about a German princess who is sent off to stay on the top of a mountain and is guarded by a dragon. A knight eventually kills the dragon and saves her. Django presents a similar story, but when presented through the harsh realities of slavery, the story takes on more powerful levels of meaning. Overall, Django Unchained is a true cinematic masterpiece and I give it an A+.",

Django, a slave is rescued one day by Doctor Schultz from the horrors of slavery to assist him in a bounty hunting mission. After Django helps Doctor Schultz, Doctor Schultz promises to reunite young Django with his wife who was sold to another slave owner along time ago. What follows is more than an hour of amazing screenplay. First off, the acting is incredibly solid and some of the best I have ever seen. Waltz and Jamie are like butter and bread in this film and are incredible and watching them on the screen together is like magic. The music, the acting and incredible journey make this one of Tarintinos best films ever. Dare I say one of the best movies EVER. Period. Highly recommended.",

Schultz gets to talking with a slave named Django inquiring if he's heard of the Brittle brothers, upon affirmation of such information Schultz proceeds to purchase Django if he helps him locate and take care of the brothers than he would grant Django his freedom along with a horse and $75. Schultz then takes Django under his wing training him the ways of the bounty hunter and he becomes his deputy. After successfully tracking and taking out the Brittle Brothers and many other targets over the winter Django tells Schultz his story of how he and his wife attempted to escape their former owner and then were sold separately, and how he would like to use that reward to purchase his wife back. They discover the location of a Mississippi plantation where Broomhilda, his wife , was sold. They learn the ruthless Calvin Candie Von Shaft is the new owner and they now know that a scheme needs to be plotted to successfully purchase Broomhilda without raising suspicion that she was the target all along. \n\nFor a nearly three hour movie it certainly doesn't feel that way as the film is so action packed that it'll keep you on your toes the entire duration of the film. A beautifully produced piece of film that stacks up with every other great Tarantino film, it just fits the mold so perfectly. Well developed characters and a unique story like none other. So much originality has been missing in westerns i feel like this one fueled the next decade of great westerns that have been released. This long list of actors in this film is quite extraordinary as there was even more great actors i could have listed. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and I'll admit i listen to this frequently it just fit the film perfect. The dialog was written so nicely creating some iconic scenes.

The cinematography varies wildly, in classic Tarantino fashion, from gruesomely gory closeups to comedic wide shots of group encounters.\n\nDjango's character arcs in a way that reflects a classic hero on a quest. In the beginning, Django is picked from a group of seemingly ordinary slaves (notably, the lowest ranking members of society). By the end, he is central in the plot to dethrone the white men with the most power. Django becomes a bold grim reaper character symbolizing raw, unforgiving power in the fight of Good vs. Evil. The complex relationship established between Django, Schultz, and Candie creates immense tension and draws interest from the audience. The depiction of Good vs. Evil reflects the brutality and societal structure of the time.\n\nWhat's perhaps most satisfying about this film is its resolution, which requires sacrifice to settle the conflict and allows Django to get what he wants. Tarantino is masterful at integrating gory threads that foreshadow each other. For example, Schultz' use of the spring action revolver to kill a central antagonist appears multiple times. Each time, I was filled with satisfying shock and joy, as I knew another climactic moment was ensuing.",

I've tried to like the Kill Bills films, Inglorious Bastards and The Hateful Eight but I just don't love them. Granted I didn't mind Pulp Fiction but I'm not a massive lover of it. This film though for me is different. It does have a few moments where I know it's one of his films and a few moments that could really be cut to bring down the runtime down but, I was too invested in the movie and outcome to care. The violence is as always ramped up to 100 in this movie but it really works, with Django one of the best gunslingers around. It makes for some stunning shoot outs and action sequences. I'm not usually a lover of too much blood. I just feel it's unnecessary but in this movie it just works under the context of everything seen on screen. Another thing that I loved in this film is the music. The opening Django theme is so damn catchy and the blend throughout of western songs and hip- hop just really worked for me. There's not many directors that would blend those two genres of music together and make it work so massive kudos to Tarantino for pulling that off and helping inspire a killer soundtrack. \n\nThis movie is more current now than it has been in the 8 years it's been out. The oppression and enslavement of black people is ingrained into almost all countries histories. To see how horrendously these people were treated is horrendous. It is highlighted by the ridiculous amount of times the 'N' word is used throughout. To see Django become a free man and rise up against these people who oppressed him and mistreated the woman he loves is a great thing to witness. Dr. King Schultz is the only white character in this movie with any conscience to how the slaves are treated. That really brings us in with our two lead characters and makes us root for them more. \n\nThe cast though assembled for this movie is amazing. Jamie Foxx is outstanding in the lead role and just oozes charisma and cool. The \"I like the way you die boy\" line for me is iconic and it just wouldn't sound as good coming from anyone else but Foxx. Waltz though steals the show his character Schultz is so likeable and is the rare good guy in the film. He doesn't have to help Django but he does and goes out of his way to help him reunite with his wife. Leonardo DiCaprio as always amazes. It's not often we get to see him in the lead villain role but this is that rare film where he plays it. He can play the villain just as well as the hero and his characters depravity is really brought to life by his performance. Finally Samuel L. Jackson is unrecognisable from his cool and usually calm self. He's snivelly and a pure weasel as DiCaprio's head slave. Having four of the best actors around really helps bring this brilliant film to life. If you're fans of any of those actors then this film  is an absolute must see!",

            "content": "Django (Jamie Foxx) is freed from slavery and hired by a dentist/bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) to assassinate murderers and other slave owners who usurped the black man in the past. On their way, Django must make a visit to Mississippi to meet plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and rescue his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) and get his revenge. If that doesn't sound familiar, replace an ex-slave with a distraught bride, a bounty hunter with a Japanese swordsmith and trainer, the slave owners with the pack of assassins, and a wife with a five-year-old daughter. Also like Kill Bill, Django Unchained uses a cartoonish amount of violence, although the latter film uses bullet squibs hidden in blood packs over blood hoses and prosthetic scalps. Both use flashbacks in different color filters to symbolize torment of the main character. Finally, both star Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Parks, Laura Cayouette, and Zoe Bell, the stunt coordinator for Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. However, Django is reduced to the simple \"damsel in distress saved by a heroic warrior\" story, unlike the other film which is a test of marriage and child custody. Plus, 2012 film has comedic elements like the Pythonesque banter from the Ku Klux Klan and some amusing one liners from the cast. Lastly, Broomhilda appears as in Django's vision throughout his quest, whether in the cotton field, beside a tree, or in a hot spring. Even though Django has some powerful imagery and glorious usage of Tarantino's \"showmanship\", Kill Bill is more memorable because of its  complexity and depth.

All the witty dialogue, the shoot-outs, and the characters make this movie very entertaining. And I have to give props to everyone's acting. Jaime Fox is so awesome as Django. The way he talks, looks at people, and shoots a gun. But there's the person he learned from, Dr. Schultz played by Christoph Waltz, whom is also amazing in almost everything he does (he needs a good director, too). Then there's Leonardo DiCaprio and Sam Jackson as pretty much the villains. Both of them are such asses, but they do it so well. Jackson plays the head honcho of all the slaves and he *is* creepy, and DiCaprio plays the owner of the slaves. These are the kind of characters that you hate and love at the same time. And of course, there's the violence. It's bloody, it feels real, and doesn't mess around. I also appreciate that it's all practical, because CG usually sucks since it's cheaper.

Django was also a blast to watch, the plot was very simple to follow requiring little effort to really pay attention to, lined with the outrageous and crude nature of the film kept me entertained through it's run time. The overuse of the N-word is its greatest downfall, and really plagues the movie from being seen by a wider audience in reality. If Tarantino would've limited its use or perhaps not used the word at all, maybe it would be portrayed in a different light. I think that Django Unchained could've been used to empower black people because at the core of the movie it's a slave revenge and justice serving movie. I think Jamie Foxx does a great job breaking the shackles, quiet literally, and making the audience feel great striking back at vile and cruel slave owners by delivering their own type of justice.",

Besides being Tarantino's highest-grossing film (reeling in $162,805,434 domestically), \"Django\" is possibly the most daring of his career. In his Oscar-winning screenplay that uses the n-word 110 times, Tarantino creates a modern blend of spaghetti and blaxploitation Western that tactfully finds humor in a KKK scene. Tarantino's ability to get the most out of actors is also on full display, from DiCaprio's utterly villainous depiction of Calvin Candie, the charming but cruel owner of the Candyland Plantation, to another Oscar-winning performance from Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz, the veteran bounty hunter who masquerades in a traveling-dentist wagon.",

            "content": "Django, directed by Quentin Tarantino, is the success story of a slave given a chance at redemption when given his freedom and an opportunity to train in bounty hunting with a sympathetic German mentor figure Dr. King Schultz. Django's position as a freeman bounty hunter sets him up to overcome the overtly racist old western society which suppresses him as he is protected by law to kill any individuals which a bounty is placed on. Even though Tarantino gives Djangos character this safety net, he does an phenomenal job at keeping the audience in the times by using subtle instances of slavery in the background of scenes as well as hitting the audience with very difficult imagery to keep us grounded. And yet it is these appalling difficult to watch slavery scenes that has us route for Django's ultimate success against this oppressive system. When we are presented with one of Django's gruesome flashbacks, it justifies the violent actions Django takes as a bounty hunter as he usually was forced to suffer much worse treatment than he made his targets undergo. For example, when Django goes with Dr. Schultz to the first plantation why was it important that he whips the white plantation worker before killing him? Well for one we saw the flashback before this where Django's wife was brutally whipped by the same man and second it is the first instance where Django seems to feel a true sense of justice and righteousness in his bounty hunting occupation. \n\tOverall I appreciated this film and believe that Tarantino was able to find a beautiful line balancing this dark and difficult subject matter with a lighter blend of comedy. It isn't easy to handle sensitive topics of racism such as the pre-Civil War American slavery era and the Holocaust in WWII, yet Tarantino finds a way to address these issues through fictional stories like Django and Inglorious Bastards which allow him to create unique plotlines and characters that sparks more engaging conversation regarding the subject matter as a result of the unusual circumstances we witness the subject matter in. I think bringing important ideas to light in an original fashions makes people think more critically about the film and therefore have more to talk about afterwards. Great film, would recommend if you have 2 and a half hours to burn.",

            "content": "Django Unchained \u2013 The Boogeyman\nThis movie is on my all-time favorite list. Quintin Tarantino does a great job developing the story and the characters in a way that is organic and engaging. The dichotomy of who Django is and who he pretends to be can be seen as the boogeyman in the film. They discuss this fact in the movie about how there was nothing lower than a black slaver. However, I believe that the archetype is likely referring to the owner of Candyland, Calvin Candy. Comparatively, Django is only the fa\u00e7ade of evil being a black slaver and his character is developed through Dr. King Shultz in an attempt to free his wife Hilda. So, we can argue that Django is perceived by others as the boogeyman but it's doing what is good for mankind. Unlike Django, Calvin is a creature of his environment that remains loyal to the ideology of slavery. The film arcs in a firefight at Candyland leading to the death of Dr. King Shultz.\nAnother possible argument for the Boogeyman in Django Unchained is Stephen. Being a slave himself, one would think Stephen would understand the plight of Django. This is not the case, however, as Stephen is the causer of the conflict at Candyland. In Calvin's absence, Stephen becomes the man who runs Candyland. He reprimands the slaves that try to run away, as in Hilda's case, this makes his role in the slave community a little more egregious. When speaking specifically of how the boogeyman is portrayed in Django Unchained, it is more obvious that the fear created by Calvin Candy is far greater than the fear created by Stephen. The notoriety of Candyland alone is enough to create fear for slaves. Stephen is just another aspect of the hell that Calvin Candy created.",

            "content": "Django: The Spaghetti Western Slave Film--\n\nDjango Unchained is violent, ruthless, and brilliant. The 2012 film is directed by Quentin Tarantino. The movie is set two years prior to the Civil War and follows the protagonist, Django, on his quest to free his wife Broomhilda from southern slave owners. Django befriends Dr. King Schultz, a German dentist turned bounty hunter, who grants Django his freedom and enters into a partnership agreement with him. The pair spend the Winter wrangling up the wanted outlaws of the South and amassing a fortune. Django and Dr. Schultz end their journey on the Candyland plantation in Greenville, Mississippi that belongs to Monsieur Calvin Candie. Here, Django and Dr. Schultz try to purchase the freedom of Broomhilda while undercover for a different business proposition, and all chaos ensues. \n\nTarantino attacks the cruelty of slavery in this film. Southern barbarity is one facet of this film that appears to be historically accurate. Tarantino's use of graphic violence reminds viewers of the disturbing reality of our nation's history; a history that is often rewritten in textbook pages and generally unspoken of. Django Unchained is a reminder of the horrors of slavery in our country that occurred not too long ago. \n\nThis film is not for the faint-of-heart or weak-stomached. Blood is one of the most prominent threads presented throughout the film. The overt, outrageous, and excessive depiction of blood in this film further emphasizes the barbaric cruelty of slavery. Torture, whip lashings, fighting, broken bones, cruel punishments, and a man being torn apart by dogs all make this film hard to watch. However, the graphic imagery is a reminder of the reality of our nation's history. The graphic violence makes viewers want to look away and turn their cheek, much like many people did to slavery. \n\nWhile tackling the brutality and immorality of slavery, the film also gives us a black protagonist to root for. Django is a badass cowboy who is quicker with his pistol than any other man. Tarantino draws upon the \"spaghetti Western\" film genre for inspiration. This film has saloon shoot-outs, pistol shooting, and bareback horse riding. This movie also has multiple allusions to German culture, including the fairytale of Broomhilda. Django is a real life Siegfried who walks through hell-fire to save his lady from captivity and ultimately emerges triumphant. Viewers root for the success of Django, and praise the demise of the southern slave owners. Soundtrack and music are used effectively to build emotions in this film. Modern music is used to make Django look like a badass, despite being set in the 1860s.      \n\nAlthough this film was hard for me to watch, I think it was well-done. This film left me feeling guilty to be a white person from the South. The film made me laugh, cheer, cry, and scream. I think it's important to tackle difficult subject matters in film. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars.",

The movie explores a story of the former slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), who together with a German dentist, Dr. Schutlz (Christoph Waltz), takes on a journey to find famous slavers - Brittle Brothers. \n\tThroughout the movie, Dr.Schultz plays an important father figure as he teaches Django not only necessary survival skills but also aids in the development of his complex character. One cannot be surprised by the character arc of Django as numerous foreshadowing elements are presented in the plot. In the beginning, the protagonist is shown as a broken character who mourns separation from his wife Broomhilda. However, as the plot progresses it becomes evident that Django is much tougher than the audience expected. With the time Django feels more confident in doing what he wants rather than what people expect from him even if it means going against slave traders. \n\tThe recurrent archetype in the movie is \"The Boogie Man\". Leonardo DiCaprio did an amazing job of playing Mr.Candy. Despite me knowing that he is a slave trader I could not bring myself to hate him. A powerful and smart man who knows how to play people so he will get what he wants at the end. Not many people know that while filming a dinner scene, DiCaprio smashed the glass and cut his hand in a real-life, however, he kept on acting (for that scene alone I think he should have been nominated for Oscar). Even though Mr.Candy is a charismatic man, many fear him because of his unpredictability, one second he can be smiling and another command dogs to kill one of his slaves. Apart from his fortune, his violence and unpredictability are the qualities that made him famous in the South. On the other hand, the second time I watched the movie I thought that Django can be also called a Boogie Man: a former slave, who turned into \"a killer of white folk\". His story was quick to spread and many people knew who he was even before they met him. For the first time, white criminals are scared of an empowered black man who could kill them without any further consequences. \n\t\"Django Unchained\" is a definite must-watch for people who crave skin-crawling scenes and witty dialogues. Its plot twists and numerous side stories will make you stay in your seat until the end.",

            "content": "Too nonsensical, too long, too bloody, too non-consistent. Not enough depth or development, the movie seems to be just a vehicle to show off the cinematographic proficiency of the maker. Also, Jamie Foxx may be heralded as a good actor, but here his character is entirely too flat, while he is supposedly the central figure. For my taste, I see Foxx way too often play parts of an angry, rather simplistic black man, which I suspect he is not at all in real life. He is at risk of becoming a typecast, if he is not already. While especially in Django he had a chance of providing an example to other African Americans and all Africans indeed, of showing growth and development throughout the movie. Evidently, Django was not intended for that by Tarantino. Having the pleasure of knowing in my environment many admirable, socially active, highlevel African expats to whom I (a white university graduate in government employment) can only tip my hat, I find it a great pity that Django was filmed in such a flat typecast way for the main character. While you certainly cannot expect Django to become the US president at the end - though he would probably do better than Donald Trump (pun intended), some more development would have been nice. As it is, I find the movie more of an insult than a liberation or an appreciation to the African Americans. It makes me wonder why Foxx wanted to do the part. If you look, on the other hand, at Django just as an off-hand story of a former slave getting his revenge on slavetraders and plantation owners, the movie does the trick. Even then though, it did not keep me on the edge of my seat or even interested, unlike other Tarantino movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir dogs, or recently The Hateful Eight. \nI have to classify Django together with Inglourious Bastards as a less interesting and indeed exhausting sit with way too little serious storyline. Perhaps amusing for simpletons and at risk of insulting large portions of the population left and right. Not very good, Quentin.\n unlike",

            "content": "Django: Unchained is set in the year 1858 where, Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave who is being transported along with other slaves to another plantation. Then a man named Dr. King Schultz (Christopher Waltz), a bounty hunter and dentist, wants Django in order to find some outlaws. After hunting down the outlaws, Django and Dr. King develop a relationship. Django tells Dr. King about his wife that is a slave at Candieland that is owned by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Steven (Samuel L Jackson) is a servant at Candieland on a mission to stop Django from fooling Calvin Candie. The series of events lead to a huge explosive ending that audiences love.\n\tThere are many reasons why Django: Unchained is one of the best movies of the last 10 years. With an Oscar in 2013 for best writing/ original screenplay, Django: Unchained does not let audiences down with amazing plot/subplots, characterization, setting, cast, and cinematography. The plot is very intricate with many moving internal and external plots; Yet, Django: Unchained keeps it easy to understand and fun for the audience. The characters are well thought out, while consisting of their own internal plots throughout the movie. Django: Unchained makes it seem by the end of the movie that the audience personally has a relationship with the characters. This film is also heightened by the setting of the movie. Quinten Tarintino has a reputation for setting his movie long before the current age. Tarintino keeps his movies historically accurate not leaving one detail out of time or place. The cast of the movie is arguably one of the most important aspects of a great movie. With Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L Jackson, Jamie Foxx, and Christopher Waltz truly owning the screen and really capturing the audience's attention to every line. Finally, the cinematography (the art of making pictures) in this film is one of Quinten Tarintino' s best. This film should be on the bucket list of every movie lover ever.\n\tThe plots/subplots and setting are the groundwork to make a great film. The groundwork for Django: Unchained holds the great movie up. In the first 10 minutes the audience is brought to the two main characters Django and Dr. King. Dr. King introduces himself to the guards (and the audience) telling his name and life story, also his horses name. This sets up a mini plot for the introduction of the film. After the miniature plot resolution, the main plot sets up. There are also many internal and external subplots that are in the storyline as well. Including Dr. King's desire to help Django vs. his want for wealth. Also, Django's lifestyle as a slave vs. his life as a freeman. Quintin Tarintino makes his movies laid out so that depending on the audience's thoughts, the movie changes. But that isn't the only thing that makes Django: Unchained amazing.\n\tCharacterization and cast are the other layers that make great movies. With the amazing star-studded cast, Django Unchained really blows away the audience. If a movie has a great scrip and well thought out, very in-depth characters along with great actors that can portray the roles, it will be a great movie. Django Unchained is one of the greatest examples of great roles with great actors. There are so many layers in this film that build the relationship with the audience and the characters. Either if you like Django: Unchained or not, you cannot ignore the pure beauty of the characterization in this film. But there is one more basic category that makes a top-quality film.\n\tFinally, cinematography is a large aspect to the movie making process. The way that the camera angles can create emotion and add intensity to a film. There are many examples in this film including, when Django and Dr. King walk into the bar and the camera zooms in on to the bar owner. This can add to the emotion of the scene and the intensity of the characters reaction. This is the art that is lost in today's clich\u00e9 films. Also, the angles of some of the action scenes in this movie are out of this world.\n\tThis film is completely saturated with the components needed for a truly great movie. With a 91% audience rating, audiences seem to agree. Some parts of the movie can be gory and violent, but the movie is well balanced in comedy, romance, and even some mystery. If you liked any other movie directed by Quintin Tarintino or are just an action movie junkie like me, then Django: Unchained is a movie for you. That's why Django: Unchained is the best movie in the last 10 years.\n",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino is not my favorite filmmaker, as has been well documented, but in attempting to watch every Best Picture nominee ever I have found myself watching Pulp Fiction (1994), Inglourious Basterds (2009) and this film. Of the three this was my second favorite as Pulp Fiction left me cold and Inglourious Basterds felt funnier and fresher than this film. This is still a significantly flawed film and the moments that were meant to leave me exhilarated and titillated never quite connected but I at least understood some of what Tarantino was aiming for. For Tarantino acolytes this should fulfill their needs but it doesn't reveal any depths to him as a filmmaker or a writer that will entice those not already enticed by his brand of loving pastiche.\n\nSlave Django Freeman, Jamie Foxx, is picked up by German dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz, Christoph Waltz, who shoots his owners and offers him the chance to go into business with him. Freeman and Schultz set out to kill the Brittle brothers and Schultz offers to help Freeman find and purchase his wife Broomhilda von Shaft, Kerry Washington, after a bond develops between them. They track her to the plantation of Calvin Candie, Leonardo DiCaprio, a sadistic Francophile who enjoys watching \u2018Mandingos' fight to the death and uses African-American women as prostitutes. Candie discovers the scheme that Schultz and Freeman have concocted and after a prolonged confrontation Schultz kills Candie and ends up dying himself. It is then up to Freeman to survive being captured by the employees of a mining company and to return to Candie's plantation so that he can reconcile with his wife.\n\nMany referred to this as a \"love story\" but the fact that it focuses almost entirely on the male character and the female character is represented mostly through other characters talking about her it is hard to invest in this romance. We are meant to see this film as being a sort of fairy tale as the star-crossed lovers are reunited at the end of the film and the villains are all cartoonish and evil but Tarantino's love for blood and guts prevents us from being charmed by any of the characters. Washington does little more in her role than flinch and wince as we are asked to delight in watching her be abused and attacked in a way that makes this film feel more like a cheap exploitation film than the high art it parades as. \n\nThe performances could also be also be described as a tad overzealous as DiCaprio, in a rare villainous role, chews the scenery but manages to appear as though he is trying far too hard and leaves us disengaged. I imagine the effect was intended to be both hilarious and menacing but I wasn't amused by his thick Southern accent or the fact that he couldn't speak French and while it was utterly horrid watching men abuse one another I was not convinced that Candie was cold or terrifying enough to carry out these actions. Jackson appears to be impersonating a minstrel as he plays a character who is rather confusingly written and it is sad to see an actor of his talent wasted on a role like this. Dennis Christopher pops up in a supporting role which strangely reminded me of Breaking Away (1979), a very different film, a disconcerting distraction during a film of this sort. Tarantino can draw the worst out of actors, as seen with Brad Pitt in Inglourious Basterds (2009), but with the amount of talent he manages to attract I am always shocked by how stupefying and misjudged their performances can be.\n\nIf you have a taste for bloodshed several scenes in this film will satisfy your craving but for me I felt that they were needless and the violence did not excite me or add anything to the story. In terms of 2012 films I don't think this was one of the best and I would have preferred to have seen Moonrise Kingdom (2012) and The Hunt (2012) nominated for Best Picture. Obviously every body has their own personal preferences and Tarantino happens to go against my own but for those who enjoy his films I am perfectly happy to admit that there is probably something I am not seeing.",

Such a scene is often lopped out from a script that is to make it to the screen and instead some other element is added to boost the script and the pace of the film.\n\nBut the writer and director of the western superhero flick Quentin Tarantino insists on going through the social rigmarole as an excuse of understudying the history. And you are up for it. That's what baffles me the most. Why have we been ignoring the lectures and documentaries and books so blatantly but consistently fails to even speculate his views on those very subjects. We are chugging it up unapologetically, repetitively. That is because, Tarantino knows what he adores about the history and what will gather and please the crowd, the most. And it is not just that he infuses the facts into narration that goes unnoticed.\n\nIt cannot just be the smoothness. It is actually the best aspect of the historical events, the so called highlights, and it is the characteristics of the characters and even the world they revolve around. He uses those tools to convert those facts into a myth casting spell upon spell on us, just like he bombards us with whistle blowing one-liners, slapstick humor and guns blazing across the room. Addition to that, you can see him using his reputation and credibility in Django Unchained by casting a cast of such caliber and more importantly using those tools into narrative that celebrates the cinema life that he lives and breathes for.",

Now, first thing, the acting was excellent, accompanied by some darn good dialogue, made every single encounter and person to person interaction so interesting and enjoyable. You literally couldn't take your eyes off the screen. But, some of those dialogue sessions drag on for a tad too long. The action is classic Tarantino, whenever someone gets shot, blood everywhere. Yet that's kind of realistic, and for a western entertaining to say the least. Being almost three hours long, I can see a couples of scenes shortened, but that wouldn't have changed much.

In the room there are two slaves on the ground wrestling with their owners edging them on, the scene is initially tense In Supreme writing, acting, and execution, Quentin Tarantino again creates a modern masterpiece with his film Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino has managed to reinvent the spaghetti western genre with a blend of dark humor and dramatic storytelling while also acknowledging and portraying the horrors of American slavery. In one particular scene, however, is quickly diffused when Candie stylishly give Schultz a nod of approval after brief questioning and offers him a seat. \n\tThe scene builds tension again when Django has to sit at a bar and not only listen to the brutal fighting, but also approve of it to keep his cover. The scene comes to a bloody and conclusion as one slave putting out the eyes of his opponent, all while the spectators watch on, black and white alike. Scenes similar to this are frequent in Django Unchained, characters do very little to stop the horrors that occur, and sometimes cheer it on. \nWhile on the surface Django may seem overindulgent in violence, it also serves an ironic twist on the viewer, who may be horrified with the inaction of characters, but enjoys the violence all the same. Ironically, Tarantino is critiquing the acceptance of violence he so often creates. Tarantino has again taken another common film genre and added his unique trademark to it, however controversial the subject matter may be.",

QTs formula is a unique story, colorful, yet brilliant dialogue, a couple of long build-ups to super tense situations that engross the viewer and perfect endings. He is simply one of the best. Hands down. However, with Django Unchained, while there were tense moments, they weren't nearly the level of the adrenaline shot in Pulp Fiction, the opening scene to Inglorious Basterds or the latter's basement bar scene. Django is a fantastic film that is quintessential Tarantino. The dialogue is fantastic. The acting of every major character is unmatched. Yet, because it lacked those crucial tense moments that made me feel the same way I have before inTarantino flicks, it does make me wonder if he has worn out his formula and needs to pull a Scorsese and do a film like \"Hugo.\" Then again, if he just isn't capable of doing that, I'd watch as many Djangos as QT wants to film since, really, it is better than 99% of the crap out there.",

I think its important to say that Tarantino treats violence that is historical accurate with the respect and truth that is needed to remember them; the violence that is fancy is over the top theatrical (sort of an \"alienation of the audience\" so that you can just enjoy the emotional cathartic-ness of a wishful-thinking, cowboy sort of justice). The only disappointment (SPOILER ALERT) is that I wish Calvin Candy would have died a more horrible death.

The only surprise element is the romance. Even though Django gets as down and dirty as the \"baddies\" he is doing it for loooove. Ahhh.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nDjango is a slave in the American South. When he is freed by a bounty hunter, Dr Schultz, they form an unlikely alliance. They spend the winter killing people for money, then get down to the real business at hand - freeing Django's wife and taking sweet revenge.\n\nMood of the film\n\nPulp Fiction, but in a Wild West setting. No wait, Inglourious Basterds, but in a Wild West setting. Okay, I give up. It is a Tarantino western, people! It is insane.\n\nBest performances\n\nIt is a tie between Django's (Foxx) intensity, Dr Schultz's (Waltz) panache and Candie's (DiCaprio) malice. (Samuel L Jackson's housekeeper, Stephen, was too much of a caricature.) I vote for Christoph Waltz. He is more magnetic than Foxx and certainly more subtle than DiCaprio.\n\nStand-out scene\n\nEish. One of the most horrific, chilling scenes I have ever seen is surely the Mandingo fighting sequence. Two slaves are made to fight each other to the death. They do so in the lounge by the fireplace, surrounded by \"gentlemen\" drinking cognac, smoking cigars and chit-chatting.\n\nNegatives\n\nI do not mind Tarantino's penchant for squirting blood, but it does not do anything for me either. It has been done, Quentin, move on.\n\nIs it relevant today?\n\nIt certainly touches on issues that are still relevant in society, such as a group of people being treated as second-rate citizens, violence perpetrated against women, etc.\n\nTarantino has been criticised for the violence in the film. His reply is that there is a big difference between the violence dished out by the baddies and the justice that Django serves up. The audience is supposed to know the one is cruel and unjustified and evil, while the other is pure and fun because it is revenge. I have to admit, I did distinguish between the two types of violence, and I did root for Django when he was doing the shooting, but whether that is acceptable is quite another story.\n\nDoes it cop out?\n\nHas Tarantino ever shied away from any issue, from any controversy? I mean, he killed Hitler in Inglourious Basterds!\n\nFYI\n\nDuring filming Christoph Waltz fell off his horse and broke his pelvis. Jamie Foxx subsequently gave him a saddle with a seat belt.",

Not to mention that this is his first western flick. It takes place in the early 1900s and is about a slave played by Jamie Foxx who makes a deal with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) to help him find a group of people and to find his wife. Django Unchained blew me away in every way possible. It was extremely well written, (Obviously. It's Tarantino) well acted, It looked beautiful and the direction was out-standing. I could not find a single thing that I disliked! Everything was perfect! It's hard to determine the genera. It's mostly a movie about slavery, but it has the setting of a western. I guess that it could be considered a southwestern movie :) The two main protagonists have good chemistry. One is a slave who will do anything to get his wife back. The other is a man who cares for him and just needs his help. Watching these characters grow together as a team was quite an experience. Especially because Django is a slave, and back then, it was unusual to treat a slave with kindness. The antagonist that we are introduced to is Calvin Candie. (Leo's role) He is a very successful slave owner and has a large cotton plantation. He pulls off a fantastic performance. There is one scene when he smashes a glass on a table and he actually starts bleeding on set, but he continues to compose good acting. The character himself was a very unlikable character in all of the right reasons. I absolutely loved this villain.",

It is a story of a slave gaining freedom and ultimately freeing his wife from slavery and in the process takes down a famous slave plantation Candy land. The movie starts with Django being a slave but he is rescued from slavery by a german bounty hunter named Dr Schultz. He practiced dentistry for a while but then became a bounty hunter. He needed Djangos to help him locate the briddle brothers who were slavers. Dr Schultz takes him through this journey and they track down the briddle brother two of which Django himself killed and whipped and before killing one of them he says to the salves \"yall wanna see something\" and blows his brains out. He is then recruited but the Dr to be a bounty hunter for the winter and the thought of killing white people for money was very interesting to Django. He became very talented in shooting. After the winter he tells Dr Schultz that he wants to free his wife Broomhilda whose name the Dr recognized because of her german name. She ends up being in candy land the famous slave plantation. They go to candyland to save Hilda and they come up with a terrific plan. The plan goes south after they are caught by Mr candy's trusted friend who was a former slave named stephen. Dr schultz is killed but Django get into a big shootout with them and kills a lot of white slavers. He is captured but escapes and comes back to candy and slaughters all the white people in the plantation and also stephen the former slave.\nThis movie makes me think of what it would have been like if slaves had rebelled and gone out after there master and try to kill them. You can imagine the pain the slaves felt but they never fought back. This movie unleashed the pain the slaves felt to white people in very violent way but get the idea across that slaves at that time would smile and the death of a white man who was their slave owner. The movie makes us think could white people endure the pains black people went through if they were slaves. There a scene where Django had to watch a slave who was refusing to fight being fed to dogs to die and this hits home hard because I could never imagined being in that position. The movie though violent makes you feel, or at least for me a little bit of hatred towards white and in some cases you'll find yourself smiling when Django slaughters all the slavers. I love the setting being the west but the town is greenville tennessee which was  a big slave town even after the abolishment of slavery. The movie show the west in the eye of a black man and a foreigner. It shows how america treated the those who were not of the country. Overall the movie is very eye opening and just show that slavery was a very disturbing time in the history of the us and we have come a long way. But we also have a long way to go.\n\n-- Joel C.",

Fixated on finding his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), Django makes quick work of locating the Brittles earning his freedom and a tidy sum of money. \n\nInstead of going their separate ways, Schultz offers to assist Django in finding and rescuing his wife. Refining Django's hunting skills and providing vital access to information, their search ultimately leads them to the slyly-charming and brutal Mississippi plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). \n\nExploring the compound under false pretenses, Django and Schultz arouse the suspicion of Candie's trusted house slave, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson). Marked and measured, they must choose between independence and solidarity, between sacrifice and survival. \n\nNominated for five Oscars, iconic writer/ director Quentin Tarantino's first western is an intriguing narrative about life, liberty and the pursuit of vengeance. Tarantino's trademark flair for dramatics and violence sit well in the pseudo-genre.\n\nWaltz once again shines under Tarantino's direction, a true master in the art of line delivery, everything about him screams presence. Jamie Foxx's performance is slightly overdone and calculated almot to the point where it looks as though he is acting, rather than embodying. Jackson (as always) brings a little sparkle to his purpose written characters, adding levity but also insight. Whilst DiCaprio, whom has always had my curiosity (if not my personal taste) finally caught my attention with the perfect balance of smarmy and sneaky, enough so to make me forget it was in fact him. \n\nA major miscalculation in performance however was Tarantino's own cameo. All most as if it was thrown in at the last moment, he attempts to match our own John Jarratt's accent in a bizarre ill-fitting mess of vocal gymnastics that is beyond laughable and detracts attention from the last 15 minutes of suspense.\n\nThe Verdict: Although a decent film from one of the most distinctive directors, I wouldn't put Django Unchained even in his top five. Personally, I think my 165 min would have been better spent revisiting cult classic Reservoir Dogs or the unique Inglorious Bastards; and I think other projects will take the Oscars on offer for the same reason. \n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 08/02/2013",

Although I have to admit, sometimes the jury still seems to be out on Tarantino's style; this movie makes a definite case in his favor. Nevertheless, the story is one that is both timeless and novel at the same time. Classic man seeking lost love, but this man happens to be s freed slave bounty hunter, killin all the white folks that are deservin' of a killin' with the help of his German friend and benefactor. Beyond the story, however, Tarantino also solidifies his role as the modern epic storyteller sparing none of the gory, boring, long, beautifully shot details. Somehow it all works. The modern western epic is here to stay with Django (and eventually Hateful 8). Is Django perfect? No. If it was perfect would it truly be a Tarantino film? Again, I say no. Much like the Japanese principle of wabi-sabi, this film has a certain something that isn't quite right, but makes it oh, so memorable (although some-times maybe just a tad too memorable). But here I think there is the right amount (give or take a liter of blood) of Tarantino uniqueness without being totally overboard. Is it a life changing drama covering unspoken hot-button transcendental subjects; well, yes and no; in a Tarantino sort of way. In summary, it is long, but it moves and is, quite plainly, a good movie\n\tAnother thing that really pulls this movie together is the acting. Tarantino as usual, formulates the perfect balance between strange and just plain talented actors and actresses A wonderful amount of convincing acting comes from Mr. Foxx. Mr. Jackson is as talented as ever (perhaps too good) as the cranky old slave. Oh, and did I mention Leonardo Di Caprio... enough said. In short, the story combined with the incredible acting make a worthy flick\n\tWhat really seals the deal, however, is the incredible cinematography. Tarantino really finds himself at home in the incredible vistas of the near-west and south in ante-bellum America. I hope that you are able to find yourself in an IMAX for this bad boy. I think that this is really what licks the envelope for me. It should be noted that this doesn't rid the movie of the necessary Tarantinoisms. Story, talent, and technically beautiful. And as an extra add on Tarantino's choice in soundtrack is as eclectic and oddly appropriate as ever. I will give this movie the solid \"really should see (aka 8.5/10). Enjoy.",

As the two become friends, Schulz learns that Django's wife is still a slave at one of the South's largest plantations and the two conspire a way to set her free. However, this proves a difficult and dangerous feat, leading to a big finale showdown.\n\n*Possible spoilers ahead*\n\nTARANTINO HAS DONE IT AGAIN. ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE OF A FILM. It was quite bold when Tarantino announced he would be trying to 'modernize' the spaghetti western with his newest film 'Django Unchained'. Tarantino had already had classics to his name, including such works as Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2, and Inglorious Basterds, but this was pushing the boundaries of cinema even more than what he was known for and what was acceptable in film history, as western had not had its hay-day in popularity since in 40 years. However, what we got was an absolute marvel and near flawless film that comes around once in a long time, and proof that Tarantino belongs in the Pantheon of Top Directors of All-Time \u00a0(Top 7 objectively, Top 5 in my opinion). Here's why.\n\nThe film is so masterfully crafted, I don't know where to begin. First, from the opening credits of the film, you instantly get the feel of the classic genres of film like westerns cinema-lovers like me adore. The film is brilliantly constructed and the story equally unfolded so that there is never a dull moment, even in dialogue-only scenes which is a marvel of a feat difficult for many directors and writers to attain aside from Tarantino's famously grand and bold action sequences.\n\nThe acting in this film is breathtaking. I maintain that Django Unchained might have one of the most legendary casts EVER assembled in a film: Academy-Award winners Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, and Leonardo DiCaprio, Academy Award nominees Samuel L. Jackson and Jonah Hill, and Golden Globe and Emmy (most aforementioned share these as well) winner Kerry Washington. Like literally just read out loud that cast. Insanity. And they do not disappoint, Christoph Waltz and DiCaprio steal the show with All-Time great performances, but there is not one weak link, all actors sharing the spotlight and coming together to make a spectacularly acted film on every level.\n\nThe range of the film is equally wowing. The cinematography for one features perfectly-shot scenes ranging from the old west to mountain canyons to southern plantations. The soundtrack is unbelievable and as diverse as humanly possible in a film, while always working with the scene its paired with. You have classical Beethoven, old west tunes, hard rap from Rick Ross, R&B, and even JAPANESE music all smushed together, and somehow it fits perfectly. Unreal testament to how talented Tarantino and his staff are.\n\nDjango Unchained also balances tear-jerking humor with a serious and psychologically complex script drawing on heavy issues such as religious ideology, classic fairy tales vs. real life, and the horrors of slavery. The movie is downright HILARIOUS. Dr. Schulz sly humor always hits the mark and Django too and there are genius sequences like the KKK horse-riding and \"bag\"-incident, but Samuel L. Jackson had me actually weak from laughing so hard, one of the funniest roles I've seen in a long time and refreshing in the film's ultimate motif of diversity and range in all aspects including tone.\n\nFinally, the action. Yes, Tarantino's specialty and flare. He certainly does not disappoint in his bold extravanganza of a finale shootout at the Candies' estate, the most memorable moment of the film and an absolutely jaw-dropping and thrilling sequence. The gore is moderate in comparison to most of his other films, genius in order to draw a bigger crowd that won't be scared off by something as inconsequential as violence, but I'd like it if it was a little more turned down (not a problem for me but others understandably) so that everyone else could love it and enjoy the film in its entirety as much as I do.\n\nThat, and that I wish the film was about 15-20 min shorter, as 2:45 is a long time, are the only (infinitesimally) small flaws I can find in this masterpiece of a film from an All-Time great director in complete control of his craft.\n\nMost Memorable Moment: Final shootout at the Candies' estate\n\nPros: Incredible acting with one of the most legend-packed casts of all-time with Christoph Waltz (show-stealing performance), Jamie Foxx, Kerri Washington, Jonah Hill, Leo DiCaprio, & Sam L. Jackson, a masterfully crafted and written story that is funny, deep, tear-jerking, and action-packed drawing on religious ideology, classic fairy tales, and reinventing a bygone genre in westerns and mixing it with modern technology and cinematic techniques, sure-handed direction and writing by a director in full control of his craft in Tarantino, hilarious in its poking fun of slavery's absurdity and scenes like the KKK scene, expert balancing of light-heartedness and seriousness in tone and plot, amazing soundtrack mixing classic Western-inspired tunes with even modern rap, bold decision pushing the boundaries of Hollywood to try to modernize the spaghetti western (a bygone and legendary genre in film), stunning cinematography with meticulously crafted shots ranging from old west scenery to mountain canyons to southern plantations, thrilling action sequences and final shootout in classic Tarantino style and grandeur, gore that's still graphic but toned-down in relation to most of Tarantino's movies in a brilliant way to not have it ruin the public and moderates' vision of the movie, clever construction of the film and story, Tarantino's most complete film yet\n\nCons: Gore could've been turned down a tiny bit more for the mass appeal, wish it was 15-20 min shorter but these both are very minor flaws\n\nOverall Rating: 9.7/10",

            "content": "Many filmmakers and directors seem to lose their touch over the course of their careers. Sometimes it seems like they're able to make a few good movies, and as time goes on their works becomes sloppy or uninspired. This is far from the case for Quentin Tarantino, who has, in the past, directed arguably some of the best films ever released in cinemas. With Django Unchained, he continues to showcase what he and his films have become best at: the ability to chose incredible actors to play memorable characters, the smooth incorporation of violence, dialogue, and tension into an interesting plot, and the creation of a setting that is believable and engrossing (if not entirely historically accurate... I'm looking at you Inglourious Basterds.) Django Unchained tells the story of two unlikely friends: a German bounty hunter and his new, recently freed-from-slavery partner, Django. The film follows their adventures into the plantations of the Civil War-era South as they transition from two bounty hunters looking for their next reward to two gentlemen trying to rescue Django's enslaved wife. Now, the thing that stands out most here is the acting from the ensemble cast. And EVERY main actor steals EVERY scene they're in. Jamie Foxx, who plays Django, does a stellar job in his role without a doubt. But he is overshadowed in most of his scenes by Christoph Waltz, and oh does he overshadow him. Waltz establishes himself as one of my favorite actors in the film industry with this film, doing an equally impressive job as his role as Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds. His character is funny, interesting, likeable, and badass all at the same time. And that's without speaking of Leonardo DiCaprio's and Samuel L. Jackson's parts in the movie. One word can be used to describe their performances: incredible. When Foxx, Waltz, DiCaprio, and Jackson are all on-screen at once, it's overwhelming in the best possible way. Additionally, Tarantino does a fine job of incorporating the best parts of storytelling into this masterpiece. His trademark tension shows up several times and, of course, what would a Tarantino movie be without the violence we all know him for? The explosions of blood and ridiculous shouting and screaming make their entrance many times throughout the movie at well-placed times. The Civil War-era feel of the movie is also great and feels authentic, and I felt immersed in the time period throughout most of the movie. In short, Django Unchained is one of the best action movies to hit screens in a long time. With incredible acting, an amazing script, and satisfying action, Tarantino reminds us of the way movies should be made with one of his finest works yet.",

His enemies are tremendous too and Samuel L. Jackson stands out more here than he has in a long time (and we're talking about the dude who always stands out).\n\nIt has all of the blood and guts that we saw in Kill Bill but takes the villains to the next level and adds in such a great mix of interesting characters; particularly Christoph Waltz's Schultz. \n\nLike, Inglorious Bastards, it heavily relies on a bombastic historical revenge plot where this time, the Nazis are replaced with slave owners. It's pretty cheap in both cases, but man is it fun- especially here when we know that bad-ass Jamie Foxx is gonna take everyone to task. \n\nTarantino's films seem to becoming simpler but the style is still there and the action is better than ever so I don't think that it's necessarily a bad change. Still, this is another Tarantino film that is exactly what you would expect. If you aren't a fan then don't even touch this one and if you are a fan, well, you've seen it already.

This is exactly the case with 2012's 'Django Unchained,' which explores a whole bunch of themes, from racism and retribution to pride and committment. This is nothing outside the norm for a Tarantino film, as they usually have at least some kind of political message baked into them.\n\nThere are many things to both admire and detest about 'Django,' which probably means it's a well-balanced piece of cinema. For one, the screenwriting is excellent, and the dialogue shines thanks to meticulous delivery from the German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) when contrasted with the brash, simple delivery of many others he crosses paths with. As the film's namesake, Jamie Foxx delivers an impressive performance as a freed slave who takes up bounty hunting as a profession as he makes his way to Mississippi to rescue his wife, Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington). Along the way, Django and Dr. Schultz bond as the body count increases.\n\nPerhaps the best performances come from Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson, as the former portrays the smooth talking owner of the Candyland plantation and the former, his 76-year-old \"Uncle Tom-ish\" head slave, Stephen. DiCaprio's most remarkable scene is when he manages to cut his hand on pieces of glass on a dining table (not part of the script) and he continues to act out the scene as blood covers his hand. If that's not the mark of a great actor, it's hard to determine what is. Additionally, Jackson's character is so detestable that a lot of the credit needs to be given to the actor from bringing him to life. It should also be noted that the diverse soundtrack is another element that really elevates what transpires onscreen.\n\nIn terms of its shortcomings, of course 'Django' is filled with carnage, some of which is so ridiculously over-the-top that it's hard to not get distracted by it. Also, the 165-minute runtime really pushes boundaries here, but again, it wouldn't be a Tarantino film without these aspects.\n\nThanks to brilliant writing, a top-notch cast and an experienced, award-winning director at the helm, 'Django Unchained' is an important film that will be looked at by other directors for years to come.",

            "content": "With Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino has turned wholly satisfying filmmaking into a science. Sure, this film might not be as emotionally affecting as Jackie Brown. It might not be as novel as Reservoir Dogs, as ambitious as Pulp Fiction, as playful as Kill Bill, or as bold and audacious as Inglourious Basterds. But Tarantino's latest is arguably the most complete package of any film in 2012, and when the only \"complaint\" you can come up with regarding a film is that it isn't as good as its great director's very best, you're probably nitpicking with a real champion of a film.\n\nJamie Foxx plays this film's title character-a slave who, in the film's opening scene, is freed by a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). Django is one of the only men in the South who knows the identity of the Brittle Brothers; They whipped him and his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), and brought them to auction where they were separated forever. But Schultz offers Django a deal: Track down these brothers and spend the winter as partners in bounty hunting, and in return, the good doctor will do everything in his power to find and free Django's wife.\n\nThe hunt for the Brittles doesn't last but an hour, and the bulk of the film occurs at \"Candieland,\" the enormous plantation home of Brunhilda's new owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). He's a frightening man and also one of the richest plantation owners in Mississippi. Even slimier than Calvin is his black housekeeper, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson). The film ultimately turns into a brutal battle of wills between both black-white pairs with Django and Schultz lying through their teeth in order to simply gain access to Broomhilda. Getting her out? A whole other story.\n\nBoth halves of Django Unchained have their own style, tone, and high points. The first half is funnier. A Jonah Hill-and-Don-Johnson-led KKK summit is its comedic high point, but every monologue delivered by Dr. King is simply genius. For the second Tarantino film in the row, the best-in-show award goes to Christoph Waltz. The competition is stiffer here, but Waltz is just so delightfully at ease. It's really a pleasure to watch him work his magic.\n\nThe second half has a very different look; The painterly sunsets and sweeping vistas King and Django travel across are replaced by darkly lit, blood-tinted rooms in a truly hell-like plantation mansion. Our heroes are surrounded by scum, and as such, Tarantino doesn't hold back from showing us their very worst qualities-the very worst qualities of any man. His screenplay packs a real punch in that respect. It's obviously not as pop-culture-heavy as past efforts (even Basterds had the scene in the basement of the pub), but the man hasn't lost a step these two decades since Reservoir Dogs.\n\nThis bloody second half is also dominated by Leonardo DiCaprio. Giving what's his best performance since The Departed, he's playing severely against type and the most morally backward character of his career. It's jump-out-of-your-seat work; He's charismatic and will woo you in, but you really don't know where he draws his line, and the depths of his hatred and villainy never cease to astound.\n\nThen, there's Samuel L. Jackson. There are parallels between he and Django in that they're both \"above\" the average black man in the South circa 1958, and it doesn't become clear until late in the film whether either, both, or neither of them is serving the cause of the enslaved negro. What we do know about Stephen is this: He walks with a limp, he loves Calvin, and he really doesn't like the idea of a black man riding a horse.\n\nThough he's the film's title character, Django's quite an understated individual. That's not to say he doesn't act when called upon. On the contrary, his arc is big and he seizes the day with gusto. Foxx underplays him, but appropriately so. After all, he's a recently freed slave stuck in the deep South, and (on a more cinematic level) there are three big scene-stealers orbiting around him for nearly three hours. While it certainly would have been interesting to see what someone like Will Smith or Idris Elba brought to the role, Foxx's presence in the film is never a sore point.\n\nRobert Richardson's photography is (predictably) some of the best of the year. Ditto the production design. What was a point of concern going in-the film's editing-turned out to be nothing. Fred Raskin proves a worthy successor of the late Sally Menke. The film's rhythms are welcome (it moves like a Tarantino film) and sometimes, a little surprising (see the aforementioned Jonah Hill scene, as well as a very revealing scene that pops up late in the film).\n\nIf this is the \"most\" anything within the Tarantino oeuvre, Django Unchained is probably his most thematically rich film. Superficially, it's a revenge film set in the faux West, but there's so much beneath the surface about identity (Schultz gives Django the last name of \"Freeman\") and masculinity. It's a really terrific movie on every level, and it's absolutely worthy of Tarantino's towering filmography.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/django-unchained-review/",

            "content": "Django Is an Instant Classic\nOne of the hardest, most uncomfortable things for the populous of the United States as a whole to talk about in our history is slavery, and the awful things that happened during this time in our country's' past are things that we avoid, and things that not many enjoy speaking on. This simple fact only emphasizes how amazing Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is. This film is about a slave, being Jamie Foxx, just a couple of years before the civil war. In Django's struggle for freedom he encounters a German bounty hunter by the name of Dr. Schultz, Christoph Waltz. Dr. Schultz and Django become friends and go through the effort to make the African American Django, a free man. After this the two go on numerous adventures in exchange for bounties of wanted men, and later end up at the plantation of a man named Calvin Candie, who is played by Leonardo Dicaprio. This place, where they encounter, \"Monsieur Candie,\" is a plantation with the comedic pun of a name, Candieland. While at Candieland Dr. Schultz and Django enact a thoroughly planned strategy to attain Django's long lost wife who currently is enslaved at Candieland.\nChristoph Waltz and Jaime Foxx play two relatable characters that anyone can reason with and liken to. First, in Waltz' role as a bounty hunter he holds himself in such a way that you can not help but like him. Whether it be his way of speaking with a respectful, and insightful tone, or the way he conducts himself in all facets of life. The way he walks, talks, and communicates with everyone else who is around him is fantastic. Doctor Schultz acts in a way that I imagine any decent man would act from todays world, and that is what makes him so great.\nNext, Jamie Foxx' Django is quite possibly the opposite of who I am today, me being a white college student in the progressive twenty-first century, and him being an African American man who is in the ignorant and simpleminded nineteenth century. But yet, somehow, Django is one of the most loveable and relatable characters in this movie. This is directly because of the way that Foxx brings this character to life. He's tough, romantic, sensible, and determined. While Tarantino did devise the script in such a way to create this character, it's the little things that Foxx does that really makes Django the man he is. The way he grits his teeth the way he stares at people, and even the way that he fluctuates his voice when talking to slaves versus non slaves, it is just brilliant. \nActing is not the only central aspect to a quality movie, sound effects are often a crucial piece of filmmaking that are often overlooked, but in this movie, Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino uses sound effects to perfection. The filmmakers make small events so much bigger, for instance, the breaking of bones are gruesome not gross, the galloping of a horse is majestic, and the creaking of a door is ever so eerie and enticing that cannot help but leaving you wanting more. These details that are often misused or even forgotten in most films make Django Unchained uniquely immersive and help take you to another world. This often overlooked aspect in filmmaking is beautifully manipulated in, and throughout, the entirety of the film by Tarantino.\nThis movie may make you uncomfortable since it is about such a controversial, and touchy topic. After watching this movie, you may think, \"where has the time gone,\" since the film is so long, two hours and forty-five minutes to be exact. But, at the end of this movie, I can guarantee one thing, you will be satisfied. Tarantino is a genius, who is accompanied by the amazing acting trio of Foxx, Waltz, and Dicaprio; this combination is deadly, and anyone who has the time should spend it watching this film.",

From start to finish you\nwill be on the edge of your seat. Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Dicaprio, and\nChristoph Waltz all bring absolutely brilliant performances. Waltz\nactually ended up winning an Oscar for \"Best Performance by an Actor in\na Supporting Role,\" while Tarantino won an Oscar for \"Best Writing,\nOriginal Screenplay.\" Highly recommend seeing this film if you haven't\nalready.",

Django Unchained follows Django, a black slave that is 'freed' by a bounty hounter, Schultz, and they soon become good friends and partners in \"crime\". Schultz asks Django for help in his bounty hunts and later he helps Django buy back his wife from one of the biggest plantations, Candyland. I won't go deep into the plot as there's a lot to explain, but I will say that it runs a bit too long. I've a few ideas how they could've shortened it up and still make it as amazing as it is. Anyways, the movie is directed by Quentin Tarantino. I'd say that says everything about what the movie is like, but for the sake of those ignorant of him, I will say more than it's needed to be said. The scenery is beautiful and the movie is very colorful, especially when a scene happening is situated outside, rather than inside a house.  The violence is amazingly fun! Nearing the end there's quite a lot of shootouts and they're all so pretty to look at! It was a great experience, especially with that soundtrack in the background! The characters are very well developed and the actors did a great job portraying them. I especially enjoyed Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio's characters as they were quite extraordinary people. Also, having seen The Hateful Eight as well, I've noticed that Samuel L. Jackson's characters in both movies say the same sentence \"I'm sure I don't know\" which I'm sure is not a coincidence, which is why I pointed it out. Speaking of Samuel L. Jacksons, he looks very old in this movie! I was surprised to see him like that. The story is interesting, though as I've said, it runs a bit too long. At times I was, like, \"How is this movie going to end\" because some scenes in the movie seemed like the movie might be coming to an end, but there was still over half an hour left! Other than that, I had literally no problems with the movie. Everything from the atmosphere to the acting in this movie was amazing! I'd highly recommend checking this movie out!",

I cannot pretend to understand the hype that surrounded this film. After the death of the character played by Waltz I had to rally myself to finish the film.

Tarantino doesn't shy away from depicting the brutality of slavery which creates an even more uncomfortable feeling at times when these upsetting themes are explored through, and juxtaposed with, his style of hyper exaggerated violence and off beat humor.\n\nHistorical accuracy aside, on a technical level, per usual, everything comes out looking aces with top notch set designs, costumes, and sound. The dialogue was sharply engaging for the most part, keeping me off kilter with a tone unoften employed when depicting such serious subject matter.\n\nThe cast was on point here with Jamie Foxx leading the way as the quietly charismatic and steadfastly determined titular character. Waltz is an absolute gem and one of the best actors out there now, but I will save further gushing for an Inglourious Basterds rewatch. Di Caprio is able to pull off a unique portrayal as the despised plantation owner by inspiring a tremendous amount of revulsion in the viewer with his actions while at the same time demanding their attention with his sophisticatedly syrupy diatribes and exhortations, leaving me disgustedly impressed.\n\nI did appreciate the level of catharsis achieved by the conclusion and while I was entertained I was also simultaneously reminded of many horribly inexcusable and unbelievably upsetting truths about our species. Because of Tarantino's style I can understand why I have heard some of the criticisms that I have for this film that you would never expect to hear for a movie like 12 Years a Slave, however I can also argue that as long as people are being confronted with these undeniable truths, who may not have been otherwise, that is a positive thing no matter the form or medium. 8.5/10\n\nSamuel L. Jackson Binge: Jackson's outstanding, and enraging, portrayal of Stephen, the most well positioned slave on Monsieur Candie's plantation stood out among a totally stacked cast. This was one of his most physically impressive performances I have seen so far as Jackson totally embodied his elderly character. Jackson adeptly acted his character's advanced age when to his benefit with stooped shoulders and a cane wielding shuffle, while dispatching a Machiavellian level of quick witted cunningness in maintaining his elevated position by Monsieur Candie's ear. You may not personally like, and will probably even loathe, his character here but that is all the more credit to Mr. Jackson this time around.\n\nSLJ January #21",

I often feel he leaves the story to sort itself out and focusses too much on style and, to be honest, his style tends to mean violent fight scenes and lots of goriness. Django Unchained suffers from this and is a bit of a \"Curate's Egg\" of a movie. Christoph Waltz is fantastic as Dr. Schultz, the smart-talking bounty hunter who frees Jamie Fox's character, Django, from slavery while on the hunt for a group of ruthless, murdering brothers. The first part of the film is witty, clever and enjoyable. Shultz and Django team up to catch some of the most wanted criminals in the US and make themselves a small fortune. However, the movie begins to unravel as the pair head to Mississippi to track down Django's wife who was sold as a slave to the ruthless plantation owner Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is good in the role but this segment of the plot feels flabby and contrived. Where the earlier sections sparkled with some great dialogue and were blackly humorous, the latter portion drags and stumbles along. This is a shame as it rather left me waiting for the film to end rather than wanting to find out how the plot would be resolved. It all could have done with tightening up and would certainly have been a better film had it been given from a few editorial snips here and there.",

            "content": "On the up after a brief moment of mediocrity, Tarantino ventures to the wild west, for his revenge epic, that celebrates the world of spagetti western, while attempting to tackle slavery. Django has been enslaved, torn apart from his love and forced into a life of misery. While being transported, Django is soon given his freedom by a bounty hunter named Schultz, in return for his assistance over the winter. However when Schultz finds out about Django's love, he feels compelled to help, leading the duo on a dangerous mission that will see them encounter a sadistic slave driver, Calvin Candie. In typical Tarantino fashion, he manages to pluck the best cast money can buy, with solid talent including Foxx, Waltz, Goggins, DeCaprio, Jackson, Washington, Johnson, Hill and even original Django, Franco Nero. Tarantino has always been a master of script writing and performance and Django is no departure here, characters will elaborately discuss all manner of topics during their travels and Tarantino manages to create a wealth of interesting and quirky characters. Shot on film, Django is gorgeous to witness, its colours are potent, the surroundings all feel perfect and shots all feel highly cinematic, all these things have never failed in Tarantino's efforts, what problems do arise are sadly unforgivable and completely stop Django from becoming a masterpiece. There are 3 main problems with Django, the first is Django himself, Foxx is excellent as our hero, he completely cannot be faulted for his performance, however Tarantino seems to be less interested in our lead and more interested in Waltz's wonderful character Schultz. Waltz is a brutally brilliant thespian, so there is no shame is coming second fiddle to his towering performance, however Tarantino decides this is more his story than the protagonists and just when it looks like Foxx hits his stride, DeCaprio thunders through, with Tarantino having Waltz and the heart throb chat it out for a huge chunk of film. It seems insulting for Foxx, he is a more than capable actor, holding many a film on his own, here he is never allowed to run with it until the end, which leads me to problem number 2. Django is about 20 - 30 minutes too long, the film has a clear ending, one where its obvious the drama and action should culminate, however just as you feel your heart race and proceedings are getting wrapped up, Django derails itself, with a character who has spent the entire run time, not allowed to hold the film, now holding the film, as we back track into needless territory for the sake of a rubbish cameo and another shootout, its just infuriating to watch, knowing Tarantino just couldnt stop himself from being over zealous. Finally Django fails in the auditory department, yes Ennio Morricone's score is out of this world, but just as you are suckering into the world and the time, Tarantino thrusts you out with modern day hip hop, that befuddles and destroys any illusion of setting, by trying to come across as quirky and relative. With these 3 factors, lining up side by side, Django constantly feels like its at war with itself, its a brutally brilliant and enjoyable movie, with some out of this world performances, stunning visuals and vicious action set pieces, but with 3 critical flaws, Django and Tarantino miss out on crafting a tightly packed and stellar outing.",

            "content": "Django Unchained is movie DJ Quentin Tarantino's 7th film, and his first foray into Western territory.  \n\nThe film stars Jamie Foxx as the titular Django, a slave who has been separated from his wife during that slavey time in US history.  One day while walking in a chain, his march is abruptly halted by Christoph Waltz, who plays a German American Bounty Hunter, posing as a traveling dentist.  One way or another (watch the movie fucker) he manages to get Django in his employ so that he can identify a couple of people needed for a bounty.   Together they set out on their adventure towards the west.  \n\nDuring their travels, Waltz becomes impressed with Foxx's good marksmanship, and friendly company, and decides to extend his hand in partnership.  As they travel around collecting bounties, they form a bond, and it's agreed that Waltz will help Foxx find his wife, ahem, 'Broomhilda' (fucking Tarantino). \n\nUnbeknownst to the pair, Broomy, is living in the most racistly racist plantation in the South, known as Candyland (more similar to Willy Wonka's factory than you'd think), run by its 'White is Right' owner John Calvin Candy, and staffed by his loyal house nigger Stephen.  Both challenging roles are expertly portrayed, the former by Leo Dicaprio, and the latter by Tarantino veteran, Samuel L. Jackson, with their relationship serving as a broken mirror image of the one shared by Foxx and Waltz.  \n\nGetting down to the nitty-gritty, this is an expertly woven storyline, with characteristic Tarantino dialogue, a decent amount of laughs, and the typical Tarantino level of over the top violence.  The characters feel like they're really interacting with one another, and the world feels fleshed out and realistic - which is sort of unbelievable considering the pulp feel of this film.  \n\nThe cinematography is good, but lacks some of the impressive and memorable framings found in other works by the director.  The lighting is what tends to stand out more here, with places like Candy's private Mandingo fighting room putting on a level of opulence and warmth so over the top that it almost emanates through the screen.  \n\nTarantino's films have become noted for their soundtracks, heavily reliant on music from pop culture, and Django Unchained is no different.  The film makes heavy usage of Ennio Morricone and Luis Bacalov (two famed Spaghetti Western composers) songs, including the theme song from the Corbucci classic Django, from which this films title, and character's name is derived.  Unfortunately, Tarantino decided to break the 4th wall, in a sense, by including a trap-snare filled song from Rick Ross called 100 Black Coffins which not only doesn't fit the scene it's in, but it fails to do so in an ironic fashion.  This pulled me out of the movie by way of my suspension of disbelief in a method so severe that I don't think any other situation in any other film could compare.  The choice of song actually feels vaguely insulting to me, in the sense that Rick Ross uses the moniker of a famous Drug Dealer, while he himself was a corrections officer prior to becoming a rapper, giving the whole line of \"we need a 100 black coffins\" an air of such inauthenticity that it cheapens the message of the film.  As a result, the trade off for using a \"gangster song\" to make the character seem \"gangster\" ends up feeling like a complete cop out.  \n\nBut, I digress.  Essentially, the film is marred by it's partially spotty (still partially amazing) soundtrack, its lack of any particularly memorable camera work and shots, a few characteristically over the top deaths, and a couple of jokes that dragged too long.   Still, that isn't quite enough to give it a bad review, and the amount of good things in this film are enough to heavily outweigh the bad.  \n\nTL;DR - 8/10\nDjango Unchained is a good piece of film, but when stacked against Tarantino's other work, it does fall flat.  The dialogue and story doesn't compare with Pulp Fiction.  The tension and grittiness doesn't match Reservoir Dogs.  The brutality and intrigue doesn't match Inglorious Basterds.  The over-the top action and out of place music doesn't match Kill Bill.  The result is the film is much less memorable, and I blame part of that on Django's character himself.  Jamie Foxx is a good actor, but he offers absolutely nothing to the lead character, and the whole movie suffers as a result.  In fact, if you were to take away Waltz and Dicaprio, this film would absolutely plummet in rating, and it's not enough for a film to be propped up by two supporting actors at the expense of the lead.",

It's an epic movie, but it seemed like its serious scenes didn't combine well with its comical ones. Sometimes, actually, it felt as if I was watching a cartoon, rather than a drama movie. Also, *spoiler alert*, the ending scene is pretty dumb and the actresses in this movie are given as much significance as the horses.\nAll in all, if you like epic movies told in a traditional way, this is the movie for you.",

I unfortunately have never seen a Tarantino film in cinemas and this movie is unluckily no exception. My dad managed to find a good quality copy and watched it. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie definitely does use the many tricks and elements of past Tarantino films but that isn't any fault and somehow creates a universe of wit and danger. Now while the N word may be said more excessively than it was more than likely said in that day and while the last quarter may drag a bit. This movie is certainly uplifted by very compelling characters and performances, snappy dialogue, drawn-out violence and catchy music. Another Tarantino classic indeed.",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite movie this year. Thank Tarantino for giving me two short but happy hours of surprise and excitement. I've heard a lot about this film before, but never had a chance to watch it until now. Tarantino's work never disappoints me before and yet He brings us another masterpiece of his film fantasy.\n\n    Just to make it clear, I am not really a big fan of \"Westerns\", whether it is American Western or Spaghetti Western. The last Western I remembered is still \"No Country For Old Man\". However, I am a big lover of Rockstar's classic game, \"Red Dead: Redemption\". After watching this film, it just gave me an urge to play the game from start once again.\n\nFirst, I'd like to share my opinions on this film from an overall perspective, then shift our focus on the performance of the cast.\n\nTo beginning, I like Tarantino's version of aesthetics of violence, thus every minute of the film is of great joy to me. Watching gun blazing like fire spitting, blood splashing like a fountain and people hit by bullets like a watermelon, not to mention the splendid explosion scenes, makes my blood burning and heart pumping fast. Every aspect of violence scene is done well and some horseback riding scene is excellent. I always tend to think Tarantino creats films in a way like a kid playing with his toy as he can do whatever he likes. As a result, in the making of this film, Tarantino's imagination is like an unchained horse running wild.\n\nAs is expected, Tarantino's film always comes with great music. Every piece of music used in this movie has the mark of his unique taste. If we listen to these music separately, most of them would feel special, some even odd. But when put under the context of movie, every single piece of music just blend in with background and it surprises us to realize that they are in perfect harmony with each other. It always gives me great pleasure to listen the background music as the movie progresses, and I smile every time when I don't understand  why the music feels so right in the movie. But there is only one problem, the rap songs. Is it just me or the rap is really out of place? It always bounce me out of the movie. Not that the raps are bad, but whenever it is played, it just don't feel so \"western\" anymore. But anyway, it could be just me.\n\nAlthough this film enjoys considerable merits, it's not flawless. As I said, Tarantino's imagination is unchained. But as a result, it also lacks direction or focus. As I quote from another high voted review, \"I enjoy every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels\"(Reference Link). For example, the search for the Britle Brothers which I initially thought to be the centerpiece of the film ends too fast. I anticipated it to last at least half an hour before Django and Dr.Schultz complete their first mission. However, it ends in minutes. It would be episodic if it is more detailed. Beyond this, the film ending seems too smooth for Django, even a little unreal. For example, it is totally unreasonable for Stephen the butler and Lara the hostess to give Django away to a railway company when they have a chance to finish him. For a merciless and skilled bounty hunter like Django, he is certain to come back and take his revenge. He kills a dozen of fully armed slave overseers within minutes, how can you feel safe when he is in custody of anyone? Nevertheless, a few flaws can not belittle many virtues of the film. Djanglo Unchained still remains to be a great movie, so I will rate it 9 out of 10 honestly.\n\n\nAlthough this film has a genius director and a well-written script, it still can't become a classic without its wonderful cast.\n\nFirst of all, Dr.King Schultz played by Christoph Waltz is my favorite character. Christoph gave great performance in this movie. as he did in \"Inglorious Bastards\". Though Dr.Schultz is a merciless bounty hunter, but he deeply despises slavery. \n\nMany other wonderful performance are present in this movie as well. Another actor that stands out of the cast is Leanardo Dicaprio. His brilliant performance portrayed a seasoned and cruel slaver with greed and hypocrisy. Jamei Foxx as the main lead, though shadowed by the above two actors, still gives great performance. Though at first he is not comfortable in Django's shoes, but once he finds his foot, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. I think he has a special talent for comedy, because it feel extremely funny when he tries to play serious, like when Django tries to give the slaves a piece of his mind in order not to \"break his character\". As a subtle actor, He is also able to offer audience a peek into Django's emotions with  a little changes in his expression or gesture. Summel L. Jackson's performance as the black butler Stephen is also outstanding.  Stephen is obviously more experienced than Dandie. After nearly 70 years of torturing slaves, he completely betrayed his race and degenerated into a lickspittle for the slavers. Djanglo calls him \"snowball\" not only because  his hair whitened because of age, but also because he is a \"white\" slaver with a black face. The audience hates Stephen more than Dandie, so it gives me great joy to see Djanglo put Stephen into justice.\n\nIn summary, \"Django: Unchained\" is a must-see for a Tarantino fun and anyone who  is looking for a western with thrilling action and funny comedy.",

Be it brutish Calvin Candie, the soft spoken Dr. Schultz or the quirky Django, every single character in the film is remarkably been portrayed. The background score gives an added thump to the story and takes you forward. \nHow often do we see that a bunch of Cowboys are riding in a grass field and a rap song starts playing in the background. It takes guts to make a scene look authentic and different at the same time and this is what the director and the cast has done. Di Caprio shines in this movie, but the real man is Christoph Waltz.

            "content": "Tarantino may be well-known for his use of violence in the films he makes, but he is also great at creating complex relationships between characters and plots which need analysis, such as in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. With this film, it is pretty straightforward what the plot is: Schultz needs Django to identify and kill the Brittle Brothers and then he offers to help rescue Django's wife Broomhilda. This film is easier to follow than some of the best Tarantino films, which is good for enjoying the film but disappointing if you like Tarantino's complexity such as the out-of-chronology plot of Pulp Fiction.\n\nHowever, one element that is maybe better in this film than some previous Tarantino works is the use of dialogue and monologues to create elaborate metaphors through their subtext, which is surprising because Tarantino has already proved to be a master of dialogue. The best scene of this film is probably when Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) is presenting a skull of a slave to Schultz and Django and talking about dimples within the skull that represent a slave's submissiveness in order to illustrate that not just slaves, but all black people (including and especially Django) need to be put in their place. It is one of the best monologues written by Tarantino, and an accident on set made the scene even creepier: DiCaprio wasn't supposed to actually cut his hand in the scene by smashing a glass, and he wipes his actual blood on Broomhilda's (Kerry Washington's) face which elevates his menace to a whole new level.  Other important dialogue in this film includes Schultz telling the legend of Broomhilda, racists complaining about the bags on their heads, and Schultz reflecting on what Alexandre Dumas would think of Candie's evilness.\n\nWhile I'm happy that Christoph Waltz got another Oscar for a performance in a Tarantino movie, I'm a little surprised by this at the same time.  Hans Landa was a much more complex character than Schultz, and Waltz rightfully deserved his Oscar for that role, but in this film, while some moments with Schultz were undeniably funny, all I saw was a bounty hunter with great diction and good wit from time to time. I'm not saying his performance wasn't good, but attempting to look at the film objectively, I don't see how Waltz should have necessarily been the front-runner for the Oscar.\n\nI'm surprised that this film is ranked so highly on IMDb, seeing that my third favorite Tarantino film is Inglourious Basterds, but what I have to admit is that this is probably one of the funniest Tarantino films to date with many good moments where Schultz steals the scene and especially the scene with the racists complaining about bags on their faces. Even the most violent scene of the movie is funny at parts since a worker on Candie's plantation gets shot a ridiculous amount of times, sometimes by his dumb partners, and he lives longer than he should and keeps screaming and becoming more agonized throughout the shootout.\n\nI generally really like this movie, but the third act is a little disappointing in my opinion, and I think Tarantino could have written the ending in a more satisfying way if it were close to or combined with the biggest shootout of the film. But then again, I guess an ending like that would have been too simple or would have seemed like a cop out. What Django has to say at the end of the film is pretty great though, and I wouldn't change that a thing about that, but towards the end of the film it seemed 20 minutes longer than it should have been.\n\nA very good Tarantino movie (though when is he NOT good?), but not one of his best. But maybe I'm of that unpopular opinion because I have a bias towards Westerns? Who knows?",

While this and Inglorious Basterds has it share of violence, it is not as non stop as you would think. Most of the films are dialogue with violent scenes intermittently popping up as a way to drive the story forward. I loved that other than Hitler, my most hated character in Inglorious Basters was played by Christopher Waltz, the same guy who played my most loved character in this film.

This is the first time Tarantino has completely disappointed me since his short section in Four Rooms. For good reason, it took me awhile to get around to watching this one. First, I sensed it would be a let down from the trailer and plot synopsis, which pretty much showed it was going to be Inglorious Basterds, substitute Nazis for Slave Owners. Second, I don't like Jamie Foxx since his \"Lord and Savior Barack Obama\" statement, and third I could see it was only going to glorify more racial division, which it did. \n\nDjango Unchained follows slave turned freeman, gunslinger Django and the man who bought his freedom, Dr. King Schultz around the south. Schultz is a bounty hunter and he soon teaches Django the ways of the trade. Their journey leads them on a search for Django's long lost wife, and that search leads them to Candyland and Calvin Candie the ruthless, sadistic proprietor. \n\nThis has to be one the most overrated films of the last decade. Nothing happens, nothing. A German meets a slave, turns him into a bounty hunter and from there.... long conversations(entertaining at times, but for 2 hrs 45 mins you'd expect more) and blood, blood, blood, blood, and more blood. \n\nThe movie has a good look and I'd love to see Tarantino go full out Spaghetti Western, but overall it's not worth a damn. The acting is good, but the whole cast, as in most recent Tarantino movies, don't play real human beings, but caricatures. Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx(even though I don't like him, he truly is a good actor) give good performances as always, but stealing the show was Leonardo DiCaprio as the ruthless Candie. If only Tarantino didn't have to overblow every piece of this movie, the performances would have made it worth the look, but in the end, it was a waste of time.",

The worst thing with Inglorious Bastards is the unbearably slow pace, as scenes last way to long with nothing happening, then of course the plot and unrealistic nature of the movie jut made me hate it, not leaving a good impression on me of Quentin.  But I was impressed my this one.  The story is far more interesting, better played out, and engaging.  The acting is good, and the script is good also, with many notable quotes. Scenes do go on for long times at parts, but have stuff going ok that keeps us interesting at least and plays a role in the film, making for a good story with developed characters.  The characters are pretty badass for the most part, or funny, or just interesting, but all have a place in a movie that covers a grand expanse of North America.  The action is of course what gives Quentin his name in all of his movies, this one maybe more than others.  The mass use of overdone blood and the sounds it makes as a body absorbs a bullet, however unrealistic, is awesome to watch making for some of the most bloody, different, yet fun to watch shootouts I've seen.  Just the blood left over in the house after the shoutout must have been gallons, all down the walls, floor, and simply everywhere.  The rest of the effects and stuff to make the shootout good where there too so it was quite entertaining, but not in a bad way.  The ending was again a massive explosion with most people dying, and Django walking off with his rescued wife. Typical Quentin movie, but a good fun watch with a good story, characters and acting, even if some scenes where a bit slow or long, but it was entertaining none the less.",

Tarantino is one of the best directors in terms of direction and in general terms. He is not apologetic and he shows how harsh it is. Tarantino wanted to get his point across by showing how harsh the conditions for the slaves were but also has a tale of revenge that is great.

I didn't mind it because Waltz steals the show with his Oscar-winning performance.\n\nThe story is a little convoluted once they start trying to save Broomhilda. It felt like Tarantino couldn't find a good enough  reason for them to not buy her from the get-go. Everything is great up until they eventually cave in and buy her, but if they're so rich, wasn't Broomhilda's freedom worth spending the money in the first place? There's not a single moment I would take out, but maybe a few details I'd add, despite already being a long film.",

            "content": "Full of anachronisms and heedless of any form of caution or subtlety regarding its subject, Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti western-stylized, Blaxploitation slavery epic, revenge thriller Django Unchained takes the filmmaker's brazen, over-the-top antics to their extreme; the film blends genres while exciting the plot with dramatic zooms and bloody, stylized shootouts set to music associated with the spaghetti westerns of Italy. The revenge flick follows Django, a slave, freed by a certain Dr. Schultz, as they travel the American south pre-Civil War to kill white men for money as bounty hunters and to track down Django's beloved wife, who is being held as a slave on a famous plantation named Candieland (after the eccentric plantation owner Calvin Candie). In true Tarantino style, the movie is entertaining and visceral - it never bores. But it also, unfortunately, never really transcends the genres that it pays homage too, and doesn't really seem to have all that much to say about either revenge or racism; at times, the film almost flips the racism that it despises on its head, branding almost all white people as horrible villains.\n\nThere is a certain honesty, however, to the portrayal of slavery and bigotry in the pre-Civil War south that is admirable amidst all of the pulp; a particularly poignant moment, after Calvin Candie has one of his slaves torn apart by dogs, has Jamie Foxx's Django saying to Candie, after not batting an eye at this violence, that he's too used to America to have this phase him - he's used to seeing people fed to the dogs. Moments such as this, and the brutal whippings throughout, are as harsh a portrait of slavery as has ever been seen in American fiction. This is admirable. But the movie doesn't seem to deal with slavery with much tact as it progresses, and every character comes across as over-the-top, unrealistic, and each has his moments of racism, even the black characters.\n\nOccasionally, the film succeeds at an odd form of slapstick satire, for lack of a better phrase - particularly early sequences involving the first plantation owner that Django and Schultz visit, \"Big Daddy\" Bennett. Schultz and Django arrive at Bennett's plantation and Schlutz requests that Django be shown around by a slave woman, but that the woman not treat him like a slave - he wanted that made expressly clear - but like the free man that he is; Bennett, a terrible racist having been won over by Schultz's offer of quite a lot of money, asks Schultz to clarify: does he want Django to be treated like a white man? No, heavens no, he didn't say that - only that Django was to be treated as better than the other black people around the plantation, because he is a free man and Schultz's valet, after all, not a common slave.\n\nAfter violence breaks out in typical over-the-top Tarantino fashion and things settle down, this quirky and tense triangle escalates in hilarious fashion in the following scene, when Bennett is revealed to be the leader of a local branch of the KKK. The galloping of the KKK is a giddy, gothic, glorious moment set to dramatic classical music that sweeps over images of men dressed in white hoods riding across open fields and grasslands - but then the scene stops, and the men assemble and intend to discuss their plans to kill Django and Schultz, but wind up complaining for some time about the hoods that they are wearing and how ridiculous they are, and how some guy's wife on the team didn't do a good enough job cutting out the eye holes, because none of them can see out of them, and then the woman's husband gets upset and rides off, and the KKK members feel kind of bad but admit that the wife could've done a better job cutting out the eyes... the scene goes on like this, and it is a highlight of the film, one of Tarantino's fine, unexpected verbal battles that are often the best parts of his movies.\n\nUnfortunately, though there are moments of inspired dialogue, it feels here more so than ever before to be a little more forced, a little too self-conscious, not as assured as the dialogue and storytelling construction that made his past films so special. In Django Unchained, it sometimes feels like Tarantino is trying too hard. Even more disappointingly, the film lacks the great suspense builds that made Inglourious Basterds so completely gripping - there are no scenes here, really, like the bar scene in that film, or like the great opening conversation between Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa and the Jewish farmer - scenes in Django explode into violence, yes, but with far less of a build, and whereas Landa was a cool, collected villain who broke naturally into devilish sadism, Calvin Candie (played by Leonard DiCaprio) seems to be just purely insane: he snaps and flips out, memorably breaking a glass with his hand (DiCaprio's own blood bled in that scene) but lacks the dark assurance of Landa (as enjoyable and theatrical as Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is). But this is a problem that hits at the core of the main problem with Django: Tarantino has finally gone over the edge with his characters, and they have almost fully become caricatures. And unlike in Inglorious Basterds, they aren't given as much room or space to really come to life and revel in their environments. For some reason that I can't quite pinpoint after a first viewing, I was far more disappointed with his characters here than I have been in the past.\n\nThat is not to fault the performances, however. Jamie Foxx gives Django a certain fierceness that is captivating to watch, and he portrays his wounded, enslaved past and violent strength with equal weight. Kerry Washington gives an emotional performance (as emotional as Tarantino gets, at least) as Django's wife, stolen from him by the racist plantation owners who made them slaves. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is wonderfully over-the-top and colorful (the problem is with his character himself, as stated above). And Samuel L. Jackson gives a wonderful supporting performance as a racist black man who stands by Candie and watches over the plantation.\n\nI found it difficult to accept Christoph Waltz's performance in this film during some moments not because it is a bad performance - quite the contrary - but because the baggage of his previous role in a Tarantino movie carries over to this, and Tarantino seems to be doing little to guide him in a new direction. The performance feels like it has the same nuance of speech and same hints of danger as Waltz's Landa; however, here he is meant to be a dentist turned bounty hunter, not a sadistic Nazi. There isn't any of the dentist here, except for the ridiculous bit of art decoration atop Schultz's stagecoach early on. Just the bounty hunter.\n\nA bit more depth, greater character development, and the addition of more suspense and more subtlety (not Tarantino's strong suit, I know) would have guided Django Unchained in a better direction. As it stands right now, I was entertained from start to finish, but found myself wanting more. It's a good enough bit of cinematic entertainment and a loving ode to genres seemingly forgotten by the masses and by Hollywood today, and Tarantino is still one of cinema's most unique and exciting voices; however, Django Unchained is not, in my opinion, one of his best.",

I enjoyed pretty much everything, but the third act felt bogged down and lifeless after Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio were killed off. It's mostly because Jamie Foxx simply doesn't have the presence to be an action hero or cowboy. He has a good look, but he just doesn't have that stern, cold presence that I felt the character needed. If only the movie was made at the peek of blaxploitation cinema, Fred Williamson would have been perfect for the role. It was also nice to see Franco Nero in the film in a scene between the two Djangos. A nice little nod (which Tarantino loves to do and doesn't overdo).\n\nObviously recommended.",

Christoph Waltz and Jamie Fox are amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio gave a completely oscar winning performance in this. Calvin Candy is so positively bad that he makes me sick, and Leonardo was so convincingly evil. I'm not happy what happens to some people in the movie, but it probably wouldn't be the same film if it just catered to my sensibilities. Amazing movie. Quentin Tarantino is a standout genius of this era. When he said \"slave bounty hunter,\" I wanted to see it. When he said, \"jews killing nazis,\" I wanted to see Inglorious Basterds. Genius Genius.

Terantino movies are very tongue in cheek with a lot of irony based on dark character studies. The humor isn't for everyone because he does use a lot of profanity and glorified blood spatters and a lot of people can't get past that part alone. If however you can take it in context and \"get\" the humor in deadpan and funny situational shenanigans then you see that a lot of the violence is ironic and...well glorified for the heck of it. He takes on taboo topics many won't touch and he does it in a way that is brash but not directed at any \"group\" singularly so it can offend everyone, therefore nobody really gets mad about it (if that makes sense). I am a girl so usually I don't care about testosterone movies but I love Terantino's style and writing so I have most all of his movies in my collection.",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is one of his more recent works of cinematic art. The plot is original; the cast is well-known, and viewers will never get bored throughout the film, even though it is almost three hours long. Basically, the film is about a slave named Django, portrayed by Jamie Foxx, who teams up with a \"dentist\"/bounty hunter, Dr. Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz. Django becomes a free man and helps Dr. Schultz find bounties, so the two become great associates. Schultz teaches Django about how bounty hunting works and how to shoot a gun. While getting to know each other, Schultz finds out about Django and his wife being split up after trying to run away to the North. Django and Schultz set out and find Django's wife Broomhilda, who is played by Kerry Washington, and find out she is at Calvin Candie's (Leonardo DiCaprio) plantation. Making and executing an elaborate plan, Django gets his wife back, yet at the cost of many, many lives. The ending leaves the moviegoers with a sense of satisfaction and happiness but with a hint of sadness. Tarantino won many awards, including two Oscars, which means that he really outdoes himself with this film (IMDb).\n\tThe acting in this film is crisp, fresh, and not to mention Oscar worthy. In the scene when DiCaprio's Calvin Candie finds out of Schultz's real intentions behind being at his plantation, he holds Broomhilda hostage with a saw. DiCaprio slams his hand on the table and breaks a glass cup, consequently, cutting his hand. Nonetheless, DiCaprio never breaks character, continues his role, and even goes as far as to smear his own real blood on Kerry Washington's shocked face. Also, this scene was not scripted. Kerry Washington was appalled by this action and you can see it in her face (Rosen). Many people would have stopped what they were doing to go get their wound checked out, especially a cut that needed stitches, yet DiCaprio continued his role as Mr. Candie. By the way, DiCaprio's cut did need a few stitches. This great scene was able to be produced because of one little accident of a glass breaking. Another example of great acting is when Dr. Schultz says goodbye to Mr. Candie after giving him $12,000. He refuses to shake Candie's hand and walks away, but Candie will not let him leave without shaking hands. Schultz reluctantly returns and shoots Candie dead. The acting in this scene makes Waltz seem as if he really despises DiCaprio in real life. His general walk of loathsome behavior, furiously shaky tone in his voice, and even fluid actions seem as if he could not wait to pretend shoot DiCaprio. His expression, which consisted of pursed lips and eyebrows bent in the angry position, is just one of great hatred. His overall acting in this scene is first class.\n\tThe special effects of every scene made this movie a great deal more entertaining. During the shootout at the Candie residence, Django skillfully shoots many of Candie's henchman to the point of leaving them in pieces. The bodies lie around in agony with blood all over them was like something out of a crime scene. About ten bodies are stacked in the center of the Candie mansion, and most of these bodies have holes as big as a person's fist. When the characters are shooting each other, pieces of flesh fly in all directions, which would explain the giant holes that I mentioned previously, and the flesh that is being blown off seems extremely realistic because of the motions that it goes through while in the air. All of these effects add to the movie's entertainment in that it keeps the viewer from becoming bored by all of the action. The elements of action are heightened in the scene where Django shoots a person's belt, which contains dynamite, and the person just blows up and causes dust to fly everywhere. The guy that blows up just disappears into a cloud of dirt and smoke. After the dust settles, there is fire and a giant burn mark around the area where the dynamite goes off. Audiences are left in awe after viewing this because of the fact that dynamite would actually cause all of this damage. The special effects make the movie much more memorable and entertaining. \n\tThe music in this movie is extremely varied and fits the movie well. The song \"Django\", composed by Rocky Roberts, is played when introducing Django in the opening scene. It shows Django, along with a few other slaves, being led through the desert. The song fits well because of the fact that it has a \"western\" tune to it, and it doubles by actually introducing the protagonist. In the scene when everyone is traveling to the Candie plantation, the song \"100 Black Coffins\" by Rick Ross plays. It happens to play right after a tense moment between Django and one of Candie's henchmen. The song gives the film a more modern feel to the movie, making it more appealing to the younger audiences, but it also foreshadows events that are going to happen. The music choice is different than any other film of this kind; it brings a modern and compelling feel to the scenes.\n\tDjango Unchained is added to the long list of Quentin Tarantino's movie masterpieces. His actors being committed to keeping the scenes going no matter what and the special effects make this movie one of the best of the year 2012. This movie will forever be remembered in the history of movie making.",

Nothing but personal taste here; I just don't get his obsession with violence and blood spatter so excessive that it goes gallons beyond what is humanly possible.  That said, this film was amazing.  It does not deserve the label \"blaxploitation,\" most often reserved for bad B movies.  This one may capitalize on Black anger and use the antebellum South's horrific practices as a perfect setting for Django's \"coming of age\" as a free man, but it rises so far above the genre in just about every respect that the label just doesn't apply.  Aside from the off-putting shooting of a horse by main character Schultz in the very beginning of the film, this is one of the best I have seen in a very, very long time and the *only* Tarantino movie I have been able to sit through.  The bizarro is actually somewhat minimal, with the exception of an unexpectedly side-splitting and totally derailing raid discussion about the logistics of wearing a white hood.  Just watch it!",

Jamie Foxx is badass in the role of Django, the slave turned bounty hunter who teams up with a German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz, who is supposedly a dentist, but hasn't practiced dentistry in over 5 years is played by the brilliant Christoph Waltz who is such a scene stealer that pours out Tarantino's dialogue like poetry. Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic as Calvin Candie, the Mississippi slave plantation owner (also known as Candieland in the film) who Foxx and Waltz try to rescue Django's wife Broomhilda played by Kerry Washington, who is a lovely and an emotional presence in the film. Watching her and Foxx together again for the first time since \"Ray,\" just proves that they are one of the best on screen couples right next to DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in \"Titanic.\" Samuel L. Jackson is also great as DiCaprio's house slave Stephen, who is without a doubt as Jackson put it himself is probably going to be \"One of the most hated Negros in America cinema.\" But let's not also forget the surprising and good performance by Don Johnson as Big Daddy, one of the slave plantation owners of Tennessee, that Foxx and Waltz trick into thinking they want to by one of his slaves in order to track and kill the three Brittle Brothers that Waltz's character has a bounty out for and also whipped Kerry Washington's character after Foxx's character pleaded with not to at the last plantation that he and his wife were together at before being separated after trying to escape.

QTs formula is a unique story, colorful, yet brilliant dialogue, a couple of long build-ups to super tense situations that engross the viewer and perfect endings.  He is simply one of the best.  Hands down.  However, with Django Unchained, while there were tense moments, they weren't nearly the level of the adrenaline shot in Pulp Fiction, the opening scene to Inglorious Basterds or the latter's basement bar scene.  Django is a fantastic film that is quintessential Tarantino.  The dialogue is fantastic.  The acting of every major character is unmatched.  Yet, because it lacked those crucial tense moments that made me feel the same way I have before inTarantino flicks, it does make me wonder if he has worn out his formula and needs to pull a Scorsese and do a film like \"Hugo.\"  Then again, if he just isn't capable of doing that, I'd watch as many Djangos as QT wants to film since, really, it is better than 99% of the crap out there.",

There's something in us as movie-goers that will always love to see the bad guys do bad things, then get their comeuppance. This film is no different, and it just oozes cool. It finds that magic spot of taking something just past the point of being silly to being somehow awesome.\n\nAs evil as Christoph Waltz was in Inglourious Basterds, he is equally good and badass in this film. He deserved that Oscar. Such a great character.\n\nDiCaprio, playing the rare villain role, chews the scenery and pulls off being the guy you \"love to hate.\" That means he did something right.\n\nJaime Foxx filled the leading role well enough, he certainly has the physicality for the role- but his dialogue delivery suffers a bit. I almost wanted to say to him \"speak up,\" like he was restraining his voice. Weird.\n\nAnd if course, Samuel L. Jackson kills it. Plain and simple. \n\nThis is an explosively violent, cleverly written, anachronistically bold musically, strangely funny \"Spaghetti-Southern\" with an incredible supporting cast. Great film.",

Fair dos, 12 years is beautifully shot and features powerful performances, but its pointlessly misery inducing. \n\nAs if you need to convince any clear thinking 21st century citizen that slavery is wrong. We know its wrong, we know racial discrimination is wrong. Granted, not everybody accepts these truths, which is more of the reason why Django Unchained is the better film about slavery as it more immediate in its message. \n\nThings might be different if (institutionalised) slavery was still a big thing in America. Maybe then would 12 years' approach be more the appropriate. But in an age where the urge to hate for no decent reason is hidden behind more widely accepted moral codes and propagated subversively when fear its at its most potent, presenting \"truthfully\" this bigoted and dark, dark period is not going to do any good in enforcing the message that this sort of behaviour is not acceptable. Racist people and similar scum nowadays claim not to be what they are and the worst of the worst don't even acknowledge their evil. They don't know they are evil,  a \"Banal\" attitude when guilt no longer effects and they just act because its all they know. \n\nThe same attitude aristo wannabe Candie sports where he is totally unaware of his own villainy; to the point where he takes major offence when Django and Schultz try to steal back Broomhilda from him. He is so blissfully unaware of his obvious moral lapses that he takes severe umbrage to Django and Schultz' actions. HE thinks he is the one who has been wronged. This is the dark heart of human evil pumping strong, loud and proud without shame of any kind. \n\nThis is what makes Django the better film, how Tarantino highlights the absurdity of the situation and goes to a certain extent explaining how such an institution as slavery could thrive so prosperously in an admittedly still very young nation which founded itself on ideals of freedom and democracy. Whereas 12 Years just showed it, Django explained it, then and now that this happens, its happened throughout all of history and will continue to happen and all we can do is fight those who strive to keep such ideas alive in our society. \n\nOn this basis, i'd even say Django is even the more humanist film than 12 Years, the braver therefore, the smarter as well and sure as hell the more entertaining. It also has the benefit of being an actual cinematic work and not just an unoriginal two hour TV special.",

He is a filmmaker known for smart dialogue, brutal violence, and various over the top indulgences.  This film does nothing to break that trend.  Anyone going into this film should know what they will be getting.  This film should be viewed as a bloody action, suspense, humor, hybrid that is over 2 and a half hours long.  This is not \"12 Years a Slave.\"  That film is harrowing, realistic, and painful to watch.  Exposing the crime of slavery with no romanticism whatsoever.  This movie has extreme violence against African Americans as well, but it serves to set up the cathartic desserts that are served at the end of the film.\nThe acting, as to be expected in a Quentin Tarantino film, consistently hits the mark.  With the exception being Kerry Washington, who really isn't given much to do in the scenes she is featured.  Leonardo DiCaprio is mesmerizing as plantation owner Calvin J Candie, whose genteel nature is just a ruse for a heartless, vicious temperment. Just as exciting to watch is Samuel L. Jackson, the very definition of an Uncle Tom who appears harmless at first glance and is anything but.  \nThis being a Tarantino joint, you are going to have to deal with some overlong scenes and one misplaced one, where a would be mob has an issue dealing with the eyeholes on their masks, seems like it should belong in Blazing Saddles instead of here.   However, on the whole the pacing here feels much better than in QT's last film, Inglorious Basterds.  \nThe extreme violence of this film cannot be overstated.  I do not know if \"Mandingo\" fighting was a real thing, but it is disturbing and very difficult to watch as presented here.  The scene also lets us know what kind of human being our heroes are about to deal with regarding Candie.  There is also another ultra-gory shootout that you may feel a little guilty to be thrilled by.  \nI feel QT takes the revenge aspect a little to far in the end.  The whole mission of the film was for Django to get his wife back. He does, and then instead of getting out of Dodge while the getting is good he goes back to Candie's estate for one last, totally over the top confrontation with Samuel L. Jackson.  It becomes a little indulgent to say the least, you will be ready for the movie to end.  That said, there are a number of great moments and you will not mistake this film to be from any other filmmaker out there.  Score: 8.5",

It stars Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz (won best supporting oscar), Leonardo DiCaprio,  Samuel Jackson (in another great and unusual villainous performance) and Kerry Washington.  It has been called a Western, because it takes place in Mississippi circa 1860.  This film is about a freed slave who partners with a bounty hunter, and also searches for his wife, who was sold to a different owner.  The film was criticized for use of the \n\"n-word\", but it is about as moving and convincing a statement against slavery as had ever been made.  The film is full of violence and blood, like many Tarantino movies, but none of it was gratuitous or unnecessary.  This is a great movie in a time where the film business has been in a prolonged slump.  The film is highly entertaining, gripping, riveting, heart-wrenchingly moving, and probably the best movie made in the previous 10 years.  Tarantino's method of story-telling, and his use of high comedy to clearly expose the foolishness of human actions, harken one back to the great Mark Twain. With this film, Tarantino has solidified his place as the preeminent director of this era, and proven that he is a true genius.",

If Leone has a corner on the market for spaghetti westerns, then Tarantino has himself the first great chitlin's southern. \n\nJamie Fox is great as usual, but it's Christopher Walts' Dr. King Schultz who steals the show with his calm, courageous bounty hunter persona. It is a true joy to see him work his magic against the slave traders, the Marshall, and the plantation owner; a marvel to behold, as the doctor slowly calms and then dismantles his victims with logic and, so often, the lure of big money. It is the lure of big money and the inherent greed of those willing to talk \"business\" that is the final nail in the coffin for most of his \"transactions.\" \n\nA fine movie from top to bottom. And considering the great injustice slaves went through, who can't enjoy a good white redneck being taken down in cold blood? No tears shed here, as most viewers would probably agree. That great joy can been seen especially in the best belly laugh Django has when the KKK members get blown to bits by a dynamite blast. \n\nHey, there's even humor. The KKK who-made-the-eye-holes scene was a true belly laugh. And the doctor's smooth, even at times silly statements are a hoot as well: \"My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my valet, Django, and these are our horses, Fritz, and Tony.\" The dialogue throughout is priceless. \n\nThe only issue I have with the film is the excessive blood, especially the ending  (and the water-melon-being-dropped splats! that pepper the film as blood, bone, and sinew fly). I also think the end was a bit overdone, the immovable plantation obliterated, but I guess it wouldn't be a Tarantino film without all the mayhem. A good watch indeed.",

Same goes to Jamie Foxx, he plays vulnerable and unsure to start with yet as he gets closer to the end of his revenge journey as Django, he becomes confident abd flamboyant, Foxx is impeccable here. Leonardo DiCaprio is almost unrecognizable in terms of behavior and attitude, he is superb as a nasty piece of work Calvin Candy, a slave ranch owner. Samuel L Jackson, Walton Goggins and Kerry Washington add more star power to this marvel of a movie, Tarantino's writing and characters here at what drive this adventure, yet the intensity amd horror of slavery also has strong authority onscreen amongst the stars, as well as some exciting moments of action and well staged gun fights.

My 'Tarantino watermark' remains \"Pulp Fiction\" and this movie doesn't rise to that level of film-making; after a sluggish start it's not until the last hour that this picture reaches a full gallop. At times the film takes on a distinct feel as a spoof to viewers taking us back to the 1960s westerns. The music was above average and perhaps the movie's best quality.

However, it is the sharp performance of Leonardo DiCaprio as the cruel and merciless plantation owner Calvin Candie that steals the show in this violent tale set in the south prior to the civil war. Inspired by the 1966 Italian made western Django, Tarantino wrote a script for this film that accent and combine his unique style of filmmaking with the \"spaghetti western\" genre while presenting an eye-opening look at slavery in the deep- south during that period. In typical Tarantino fashion this movie was not made for the faint of heart with its extreme graphic depiction of violence and torture...so be warned.

I feel like a shit for saying that, but for some reason I expected more... Since he was covering a subject that hasn't been covered, I guess I assumed it would be as revolutionary as Pulp Fiction, but for the most part it was pretty basic (For Tarantino standards.) I believe it relied a little to much on its premise, without tending to developing new and interesting characters. I was kind of annoyed every once and a while, something I NEVER feel with Tarantino flicks. All I have to conclude with is this : Tarantino is getting old, not useless, just old. Still a great movie though... no doubt.",

But the first half was a superbly written masterpiece that very often had me in the moment, with no idea of where the train was actually headed. Christoph Waltz's character was particularly intriguing, pairing quick wit with gun-slinging skills. The sequence with the klansman complaining about having difficultly riding with the bags over their faces was just the most ridiculous, hilarious, and brilliant part of the entire film. I could certainly have done with a little less race language, though I suppose there's never such as thing as \"just the right amount\" of the n-word in a movie, and it's not like it was out of context.",

            "content": "\"Django Unchained\" is a very interesting, well-edited, well-directed and acted film, but it's also an uncomfortable film. Whether you have a problem with the violent depiction of slavery, the idea of a slave hero taking revenge, the torture that's shown, the death, or the blood, it just doesn't go down easy. As an action film it works rather well, and the fact that Django (Foxx) is out for vengeance against those that have wronged him and his wife, makes it one of the better motivated films about revenge. It also puts traditionally shown torture in exploitation films into a new context, as it's realistic and historically accurate, which only adds to the unsettling quality of the film. Christoph Waltz gives an amazing performance as a character that so rarely gets written or shown onscreen. Leonardo DiCaprio is very malevolent as Calvin Candie, showing us a villain that is almost unknowing of the absolute cruelty he inflicts, while also being arrogant, pompous, and spoiled. As a dandy he is nothing but interesting, although much more awe-inspiring is Samuel L. Jackson as the head house slave Stephen. His performance was incomparable, obviously the more complex and entertaining villain, even alongside Candie's absolute evilness. Stephen is both treacherous and crafty, unlike many villains seen before, and the fact that he betrays his own people makes him the more hated. The ending is where this film lost me. It kind of peters out here and there before gaining back its momentum, inevitably slowing to a grave pace at certain points. While the ending was significant in the awesomeness of the action, it felt tacked on in some way, less satisfying than if Django outright won, without consequence. That may seem selfish of me to say, and small minded, but a shootout would have felt better deserved.",

            "content": "The once-charismatic-counter-culture director of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction has reached a new low point with Django, a film that styllistically might have a superficial resemblance with his old films, but is ultimately a pretty mainstream hollywood fantasy of the cool, good guys beating the caricature, bad ones with pomp (look at the finale sequence with the dynamite and Django's wife shutting her ears with a silly, theatrical gesture while the epic, spaghetti-western music reaches a climax). The film of course uses a lot of shots that are both a satire and a tribute to spaghetti westerns (like the very fast zoom-ins that give the film the kitsch quality of the old, Italian b-westerns) but Tarantino seems to use them for no other reason than to be playful. Under this post-modern, playful surface there is a very conventional plot, which pretends to be dealing with a serious subject like slavery. Gone are the daring plot structures of Pulp Fiction, gone the subtle black humor and the unexpected dialogue; in their place we see silly humor (like the guy who is shot repeatedly by his own guys in the mansion) and testicle-shooting jokes. Yes, the Christoph Waltz character is entertaining but not as much as his writer would like to think. But actually the problem transcends this film and has to do with the attitude of audiences today, who are uneducated in cinema (because they only watch films that are from 90s onwards) and see in the empty post-modernism of films such as this, intelligence; or mistake the countless references to other films (they haven't seen) for depth. This fake post-modernism under whose skin lies the wolf of a cheap, easily-digested philosopy of consumerist Hollywood has nothing revolutionary, despite selling itself as such. Tarantino's films were all style and no substance from the beginning of his carreer of course (and the self-consciousness of this was their strength), but now the style doesn't seem fresh anymore and the films are trying to be something more than empty style, they try to be meaningful in resolving conventionaly the tensions of the linear plot. The film could easily have the title Tarantino Enchained.",

Why make a film where the violence is uncomfortable to the point of exhaustion, then make scenes where we are supposed to be cheering for the violence on screen. It seems like a sadist's exercise in cinema at points and that really knocks the film down a lot. The ending was the worst part because the film ends with an explosion of vengeance that wasn't needed.. The film was showing some of the horrors of slavery and yet it expects the audience to jump out of their seat in excitement when more people die in brutal ways? I Just wish if they were making a film about a freed slave becoming a bounty hunter, that they stick to making a buddy western film instead of injecting scenes of  a cruel nature which doesn't fit with the film. A film like \"12 years a slave\" perfectly works because it is a true story showing you the horrors of slavery at it's worst without becoming a fantasy  like Django.

The tale follows the life of Django, as he manages to transform himself from a mere slave to one of the best gunsligners around. Whilst I never consider Fox for his acting, he portrayed the driven character convincingly. Alongside the excellent Waltz, they are a fine lead duo, cleverly ensuring that things almost always go in their favour. The film takes an interesting; if not expected turn, when they begin to pursue Django's love interest; the brilliantly named BroomHilda. From this point on the film steps up a notch in tension and excitement, due considerably to the ever brilliant DiCaprio. His portrayal of Calvin is amongst his best work (although I am beginning to use this phrase all too often). The somewhat psychotic character perhaps optimises those who possess great power and money during this era. The scene set around the dinner table is of great quality, particularly as the blood of Calivin' s hands is that of his own. I half expected the medics to come charging onto the screen, but it inevitably added to the performance. \n\nHumour also runs throughout which is more than welcome; albeit unexpected. Jonah Hill and Samuel L Jackson stand out, and keep everything relatively light-hearted. I did however think this element went somewhat too far, so as to detract from any tension or emotion. Whilst the shootout towards the end was amusing and somewhat exciting, it did seem too spoofy. However overall this was a very enjoyable watch, featuring multiple stand-out performances from the leads.",

As the movie derails into loud, annoying, over-the-top action, it loses any substance it may have earned. The film demonstrates the complete lack of respect Tarantino has for his audience. He expects people to enjoy gratuitous violence without any remote meaning. And sadly, looking at the success of the film, he's right.\n\nNow it is not fair to say the whole movie was bad. While Django himself was boring and flat, Christoph Waltz was a joy to watch. But it was Leonardo DiCaprio who completely stole the show from the moment he was on screen. Great acting that fit the movie absolutely perfectly and created the best character in the film, by far. \n\nEveryone else in the film was completely forgettable. And as to Samuel L Jackson, I was just confused. There were no explanations, no meaning, and nothing to take away from his character. \n\nThe only reason this film even deserves 2 stars is the fun, adventurous first three quarters of the movie. What could have been  a four star western was wasted with boring, meaningless, violence. If westerns want to be taken seriously, it has to be done better than this. \n\nAlso, did I mention they put rap in it? \nRap, in a western. Abysmal.",

This film has a very good cast and great acting, Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo Di Caprio, Kerry Washington and Samuel L Jackson. Everyone is amazing, especially Waltz, Di Caprio and Jackson. This film is very well directed by Quentin Tarantino. This film is really entertaining and I love the scenes of Django Schultz killing for money. This film is so gory and just tones of fun, although one of my problems is that while I do appreciate the two different types of violence Tarantino is using, over the top gory and fun like the candy land shootout and the more disturbing violence like the Mandingo fight or the dogs ripping apart the slave or Broomhilda being tortured. I'm fine with the violence and it's not like I couldn't watch any of it but at some points I don't feel the two times are handled too well. The candy land shootout is amazing. The soundtrack is very good and this film is just a lot of fun. However I think the films is just way too long. The film is nearly 3 hours, I mean Tarantino has made some long movies before but I think this film is just too long. The ending is in my opinion a big let down when compared to just how good the rest of the film was. There's a whole sequence involving Tarantino in an acting role as a miner. In my opinion that bit should have just been cut. For me the first two acts are fantastic but the third act is let down. However the amazing candy land shootout does somewhat make up for it. While Django Unchained is a great film I just don't think it's as good as Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs and Inglourious Basterds. However Django Unchained is still a great film with a dissapointing ending. A-",

            "content": "Wednesday, January 15, 2014\r\n\r\n(2012) Django Unchained\r\nWESTERN\r\n\r\n It's supposed to be a homage to the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Corbucci and Leone but after already seeing so many, I actually thought this film had no rhythm in terms of the storyline. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino who writes great dialogue but it doesn't seem to belong to this film since the perception that wealthy residents of Mississippi speaking perfect English like they all have 100% IQs is unrealistic since it has always been a proven fact that throughout American history the state of Mississippi contains some of the less educated people of the United States Of America. No matter how long ago the film is based on some of the dialogue exchanges is similar to how some people speak here for theirs hardly a character that speak like how people used to speak during the 1800's and from the most racist state too.         \r\n\r\nThis is two movies and not one where at the first half is Django helping and aiding a German bounty hunter- the second half centers on bounty hunter Schultz helping Django retrieving his wife back from the Leo Di Caprio character.  Jamie Foxx stars as the title character Django who was initially walking along with a group as a slave until he was saved by a bounty hunter who calls himself Dr. King Schultz played by Christopher Waltz.  At this point we don't fully understand why he saved him, but it was for financial motivations, since Django happens to know who and where some the wanted men happened to be located- and they're wanted dead and alive which means that besides personified as not being likable characters because they're racist that they also perform other atrocities against whites.  Tarantino has shown many great ideas but for reason they're not well executed here, for instance at the beginning, Schultz defends himself from a couple of racist outlaws escorting the slaves who're walking with chains on their hands and feet.  Schultz then manages to shoot one person dead and killing the other outlaws horse.  The guy curses but doesn't try to slip his leg out of his dead horse, and as Schultz and Django are leaving, the other slaves then attack him.  This scene is baffling since throughout the years I've been watching Westerns and so forth ... and from what I know from real life, majority of them who're in that exact situation are able to pull or slip their leg out, but in this film, he's completely helpless and unable to do that. I mean, if you're going to make a movie, check if pulling one's leg out is not possible. \r\n\r\nAnd the scene after the Schultz and Django gather up their kills, how did Schultz know when and where a particular racist mob is going to come after them, for the movie never explains.  Nor do we know about how Schultz is able to know  whether or not other racist mobs are going to come after them just because most citizens at that particular time don't like the idea that Schultz is associating himself with someone who's supposed to be a slave.  I mean, what's stopping other mobs from other towns coming after them since some of the wanted people Schultz had killed also had friends as well for those 'wanted dead and alive' situations seems almost entirely blatant. And it's the result of Tarantino watching many \"Spaghetti Westerns\" and not so much American ones. And because Tarantino has a habit of duplicating certain scenes from other movies, some of them don't seem to be better than what I had already seen such as \"Mandingo\" and the gun scenes that is similar to \"A Better Tomorrow II\". Tarantino stuffs his characters with a lot of smart dialogue but they don't appear to belong to this film if viewers were to compare this with other Spaghetti westerns, you will find that many of it's dialogue especially the ones directed by Sergio Leone one will be able to see that the dialogue exchanges are always compromised with the Eastwood character saying the least. We don't see any of that done here.  Winner of 2 Oscars out of 5 nominations. \r\n\r\n2 out of 4 stars",

            "content": "Finally, Tarantino has created a film that he has been paying homage to for so many years. Django Unchained is Tarantino's 7th film and still hasn't lost his touch. Sadly Django Unchained is not perfect, as it has problems.\n\nDjango Unchained follows the same approach that was applied to Kill Bill, driven by a clear end goal and uses a linear approach in telling it's story, despite a few flashbacks. Though similar, it is a major improvement from Kill Bill as Tarantino keeps our attention with it's quirky characters. Characters in this film are definitely a much needed depth, with a richer backstory, in comparison to his previous films. Though the story does somewhat touch on previous territory, like the Django being trained by Schultz similar to The Bride trained by Pai Mei and Bill, and also moments where characters are camping telling a story. The film is definitely a big film, with a story that spans on long periods of time and creating personal growth for the protagonist. It would have been more interesting, if Django Unchained explores more of his personal and physical journey of becoming a bounty hunter. The film's dialogue is quite fun and it plays around with the dialogue found in classic Westerns. I did enjoy the fact that Tarantino has written two characters that clash in personality, Schultz and Candie, as their conversations with one another especially towards the end was thrilling to watch. Great dialogue is being written for Schultz and Candie as they represent the most over the top characters in the film, aside from Samuel L. Jackson's character. The Schultz character is definitely a complex one, for a Tarantino film, as this character seems to be doing his bounty hunting job as he has a sense of morality, which is probably the main reason why Candie and him resent each other.\n\nDjango Unchained tackles the genre that Tarantino seems to be in love with the most, and it seems like this is a film he has always wanted to tell but because this is a Tarantino film, it doesn't stay on course with the traditional Westerns by exploiting a topic that is barely touched on in the genre or at least not commonplace within the mainstream films, slavery. This does make the film a bit controversial as not everyone can be comfortable with the topic and even to the point of being offended. Both Inglourious Basterds and this film, touch on history but they don't ever become a social commentary or it never places the situation on trial, rather it is just used as a backdrop. Tarantino avoids having his characters become a representation of the cultures within that era. If you want to watch a film that touches on these themes with depth and fueled by a message, then watch Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave, but if you want to see a fun film then watch Django Unchained. This film in a way follows Kill Bill's approach in it's story, with a clear end goal, but this film balances the style and substance much better with it being consisted throughout the entire film. Django Unchained strays away from Tarantino's common use of the non-linear narrative and leans on to the conventional 3 act approach but keeping it feeling fresh due to his style. There are 2 scenes that were done so well that they deserve a mention, these scenes are the KKK segment and the Dining Room scene with the principal characters.\n\nRobert Richardson returns to work with Tarantino and their collaboration always seems to give off positive results and this is mainly due to the understanding of each other's vision. Both have created a look that is reminiscent of the classic Westerns, using a warm palette to create the atmosphere and softer shots, in order to have the audience feel immersed to the era. The film also contains the quick zooms and close ups that were found in the films that this is paying homage to. With each subsequent film, Tarantino's budget and trust from the studios seem to rise which allows him to be ambitious in his work using multiple locations to film and build up faithful and detailed production sets. As the characters in this film have much more depth than Tarantino's previous film, the photography was able to convey that depth to these characters which then sells the character's motivations.\n\nSimilarly to his previous film, Tarantino has taken a soundtrack approach rather than hiring a composer to create an original score for the film. The tracks he chose though are score driven and again chooses the tracks that are either from Morricone or at least similar. That does allow the film to feel like a Leone film at times. Tarantino interestingly enough has used Hip-Hop/Rap music on certain moments but it comes off more as humorous, which allows the audience to not take the film too seriously and maintaining that fun upbeat tone.\n\nDjango Unchained may not be an ensemble film like Inglourious Basterds but this is due to the story being a bit more grounded and personal. Jamie Foxx as Django was a decent choice but he didn't really create something astonishing here with the character or maybe he was severely overshadowed by the acting performances from Waltz and DiCaprio. This is definitely the best that I have seen from Kerry Washington but it doesn't seem to be enough for me to highly appreciate it. Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio on the other hand was a stand out in this film delivering performances that will always be remembered when people look back at their filmography. Waltz was able to come off as charming which makes him so likeable and he delivers his lines with amazing grace. DiCaprio creates this menacing character but at the same time able to give off a sense that he is a phony and a bit of a try hard. Samuel L Jackson was great in this, with an introduction to a character that will leave you surprised on how unlikable this person is.\n\nDjango Unchained is a fun Western film that I have been waiting for him to make since he started his film career. It contains amazing performances and great direction from Quentin Tarantino. Yes, Django Unchained could have been better but it has enough great moments for this to be in the stronger side in the director's filmography.",

The rest was bland rehash stuff from revenge flicks previously done and done better. Waltz is a great actor, don't get me wrong, but he did the exact same character from Inglorious Basterds, but he was switched to the \"good\" side. This is in no way a masterpiece. It has gore, action and a great cast, but people should stop brown nosing Tarantino for his movies. They're redundant and very boring. It is better than the atrocities he made in the nineties such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but just barely.

They talked about Mandingo fighting; that really happened? Well, if Tarantino traveled in time to the antebellum south and he witnessed something we don't have registered in history, yes it really happened. They chose the best one to be the white villain, DiCaprio, because his script was psychological and DiCaprio always do a good job when it comes to this. It went too slow and the story was very unilateral, we need more perspectives if we have a 165 minutes movie. The racist black played by Samuel L. Jackson was too much, maybe the purpose of that character was to make you angry, but hey, the black racist was even more racist than Calvin Candie (DiCaprio). We have a lot of blood at the end, to satisfy the need of brutal action that we lost throughout the movie; it was a positive trait though. The sacrifice of Schultz was unnecessary, even when it increased the quality of hero that Django already had (now he's not only reclaiming his girl, now he's taking revenge for his friend). Well, with all that said, 3 stars and a half are good enough to this movie.",

I was 25 years old when Pulp Fiction came out and remember thinking that it was one of the most fresh and original films I had ever seen; I loved every minute of it. The Kill Bills were clever and inventive, and for me, Inglorious Basterds was perfection. I mention these things because I truly \"get\" where Tarantino is headed most of the time with his art's direction, but I think he completely sold out the younger generation with Django. Mind you, I am no champion for black rights, but I found the use of Rick Ross and Tupac in the soundtrack for a 19th century film to be not only a bit disrespectful, but incredibly nonsensical and merely a thinly veiled attempt to draw in the Millenniels. Whereas the over the top violence worked well in the Kill Bill's, it was certainly ill placed in a movie concerning slavery. Leo was awesome, as was Don Johnson and Jackson, but Jamie Fox seemed to walk through the role mimicking his worst Clint Eastwood impression possible.",

Probably 45 minutes too long. Almost nothing seems to happen for nearly an hour in the first half of the film. The dialogue isn't a patch on some of his best films, and the whole thing is massively self-indulgent. The final scenes are simply ridiculous: if you thought the slaughter at the end of  Kill Bill pt1 was gruesome, you ain't seen nothing. The very last shots are awful; utterly trivial and (IMHO) a huge misjudgement of tone that undermines some of the serious depiction of slavery and brutality he's lingered on for the previous 163 minutes. They nearly ruined the whole thing for me (but by then my patience was already gone...!). \n\nI didn't much care for Inglourious Basterds on first viewing, but really liked it second time around.

Nevertheless, when you set those things aside (if you can), then I think we can see that Tarantino has a masterful touch as a director who pays attention to the tempo and pacing of scenes, to the suspense that can be generated through camera movement, cutting, and, of course, his trademarked dialogue.  He creates incredible set-pieces that are set apart by purposeful lulls (in this film, shot against nature's majestic beauty in some cases, or beauty created by the director's eye, something new in Tarantino's work). However, there are just too many set-pieces, as if the temptation to show-off could not be resisted. Jamie Foxx is persuasive as the ex-slave turned bounty hunter but Christoph Waltz very nearly steals most of their scenes together with his witty German bounty-hunter.  Leonardo DiCaprio is weird as the plantation owner into slave-fighting, almost transcending his usual self, whereas Samuel L. Jackson as the sycophantic head slave proves unable to do that even under old man makeup.  A film in line with Inglourious Basterds in many ways and showing Tarantino's development on many fronts but always with his glee in teasing the audience with anachronistic music (Jim Croce, modern rap), comic asides (the KKK-bag scene), cameos and recycled stars of the past (Franco Nero, Don Johnson), and so on.  Despite his greater control, he just can't control himself.  Finally, does the film tell us anything about slavery that we didn't already know? It is grim material for a film.",

            "content": "I watched Django Unchained by myself, which is a thing I've started doing now that I'm taking my reviews a little more seriously. It's a little degrading but totally worth it, now that I'm realising I just had the misfortune of watching bad movies when I went alone before, and it can actually be enjoyable, so long as the film itself is good.\n\nDjango Unchained is totally good.\n\nIt's not without flaws. It's broken up into pieces in much the same way as Tarantino's last effort, Inglourious Basterds, but where in that case the segments made up little chapters, in Django, the segments just unpleasantly breaks the story-flow apart and brings you out of the environment Tarantino worked so hard to create (also titling one of these chapters with no capital 's' in 'Somewhere' pissed off the OCD Grammar Nazi within).\n\nAlso, why did the soundtrack feel the need to sing about everything that was happening? I was watching the movie as it unfolded, and the twangy voices in the background served solely to aggravate me and bring me further out of the actual drama. It's meant to be an exploitation film, not a Randy Newman concert.\n\nThere's a scene where KKK forerunners reenact the Lion King, which was just plain ridiculous, but they (complete with Jonah Hill) at least manage to make this humorous, unlike my other qualms with Django which make it just plain stupid.\n\nFor the most part though, the film's great. There wasn't much chance of it being anything else, Tarantino's a master who I've enjoyed since his very beginning (though an argument could probably be made for the failings of Death Proof). The flashbacks are brilliant, the colour scheme is some of the most fantastic work I've seen, there's great lines such as \"I like the way you die, boy\" to walk away with, and the shootouts (though admittedly 100% foreseeable) are some of the most enjoyable work I've been able to watch this year.\n\nPeople will complain about the film for many reasons, I'm sure. Not least amongst them is the fact that Django Unchained has use of the word \"Nigger\" probably more than any other film I've ever seen. But also because the pace wasn't fast enough for some, or maybe the events weren't all together historically accurate. But this film is powerful, and at the end of the day, Tarantino is here to right characters. Perhaps none in this were as staying as Hans Landa (portrayed by Austrian actor Christoph Waltz [Epic, Carnage, The Three Musketeers, The Green Hornet] who in Django plays Dr. King Schultz) of Inglourious Basterds, but the fact is he wrote a role for Leonardo DiCaprio (Inception, Gangs of New York, The Man in the Iron Mask, Critters 3, The Departed) that actually made me like him. Which is something I've been managing to avoid for years.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson's (The Avengers, Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Spirit, 1408, S.W.A.T., Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction) work in this alone is enough to make Django worth watching, not to mention the fact that Tarantino had me genuinely convinced that Jamie Foxx (Due Date, Law Abiding Citizen, Jarhead, Stealth) being up on a horse was a big deal, just because he's black. He cameos the (quite literally) most convincing Australian accent I've ever heard in my entire life (from a non-Australian, of course) and more importantly he does it by the side of genuine Aussie John Jaratt (Rogue, Wolf Creek). It may have had nearly as many endings as The Return of the King but Django Unchained is well worth the three hours it runs for.\n\n78%\n\n-Gimly",

            "content": "Django Unchained, the latest in director Quentin Tarantino's string of gratuitously violent revenge flicks, is also the first film of his that I've had the opportunity to see in its entirety. I have no real grounding comparing it to his other films, so I want to see how it holds up compared to movies in general that deal with racism, or the Wild West. In the latter regard, Django Unchained was fantastic as a standalone action film. Right as I saw the opening scene, with Dr. King Schultz casually shooting a slaver dead in order to acquire Django, I was riveted to my seat. Despite the nearly three-hour length, I noticed no issues with pacing, and was continually invested in all the witty banter Tarantino had to offer. The writing, which won an Oscar, held the movie together, seamlessly combining comedy, drama, and general awesomeness into a tale of epic proportions. Django Unchained, first and foremost, is a character piece-nothing happens unless it reveals or alters a major character arc, and that gets rid of any banal repetition the movie would otherwise have to bear. Furthermore, the characters are unpredictable, making the jigsaw puzzle of their collective saga all the more interesting to solve. \n\nAny film can attempt to tackle the heavy subject of race, but it takes a masterpiece to flip the issue over its head with any real success. Django Unchained achieves this by reversing the roles of white and black, master and slave, and then makes this transition as natural as possible. For instance, plantation owner Calvin Candie is not only entirely dependent on his slaves for his profits and lifestyle but also entirely trustful of them with these things. Part of this humanization of the villains may stem from the good reputations of the A-list actors who play them, but the villains themselves are also written as what amounts to the living embodiments of hypocrisy. \n\nWhile the villains of this movie have muddled motivations, Django's own intent is obvious-to rescue his wife Broomhilda from slavery. Despite this being the first Tarantino film I've seen, I was well aware of Tarantino's penchant for over-the-top blood and gore, which made me worry that Django would trade his sense of heroism for pure revenge. Then I actually saw the movie rather than jumping to conclusions, and it seems that to Django, revenge IS heroism. Quite simply, the former slave has nothing left to lose, and must regain not only his wife but his dignity. Therefore, he'll never be morally satisfied until all who oppressed him feel the same wrath that was inflicted on him, on Broomhilda, and on all slaves. In this film, this path is the only one that makes any sense. \n\nThis bloody, unapologetic variety of thematic expos\u00e9 also left me caught off-guard by the level of visceral comedy inherent in the film. All the humorous banter both veiled to the characters and made clear to the audience a growing ascent towards an epic showdown, a dramatic foil of every character onto one another: Django and Schultz, Schultz and Candie, Candie and his favorite slave Stephen, and Stephen and Django. Each case wrought mutual resentment out of the fundamentally polar and irreconcilable differences everyone holds between each other. Skin color is the easiest example, but the same applies for two people born into the same race-for instance, Schultz's intellect and sophistication inversely reflects Candie's feigned interest in the arts and cultures. Meanwhile, the title character of Django, whose hatred of those who enslaved him and others compounds with the visceral imagery of hotboxes, whiplashes, and runaway brands, never had much humor stem from his own character arc, instead working off of others' interpretations of him (i.e. paraphrasing his former owner with the line \"I like the way you die, boy\"). In this way, his life as a free man is shaped fully by his experiences in the movie. And just when matters settle down, BANG! Someone is lying, dead on the ground. Yes, there's a bit of blood, but I can easily tell it's fake. I was made to laugh at the demise of minor troublemakers or major outlaws, knowing that each of their actions in life were all in vain. I enjoyed myself despite my moral objections to murder, and I wanted more of the satisfying resolutions to petty characters. Anyone versed in these sorts of hard-R films may think I'm too na\u00efve for my own good, while those who tend to avoid the films for these reasons might also try to reason some sense around me. This is the nature of the Tarantino film, and it will never go away. And I love it. \n\nSo to sum matters up: the directing is superb, the writing is fantastic, and the acting is phenomenal. The movie knows how to make me laugh even and especially when drenched with the gratuity of Hollywood splendor. It parodies itself in its overdose of violence, In any case, I appreciate how this film retains all its viscosity and balances the violence with the right characters and plot needed to provoke that violence. No, it's not perfect, but that's not the point; the point is to have fun. Django has truly been unchained. And now, I feel the same way.",

            "content": "Django Unchained is not an excellent movie and certainly isn't Tarantino's best movie, but it IS a good movie overall (even despite the approx. 3hr runtime).  It shows how Tarantino has matured as a filmmaker over the past 20 years.  Previously rough edges are now smooth, familiar.  This includes the cheeky violence Tarantino is famous for.  His movies are the rare sort where it's legitimately okay to laugh at the sight of a woman flying full-force off screen while being gunned down in cold blood.  While Tarantino the screenwriter and filmmaker has reached a new level of maturity, Django breaks no real ground as far as storytelling goes, and breaking ground is what made Tarantino famous.  But I think Tarantino's most significant achievement with Django, thanks to Jamie Foxx's & Christoph Waltz's superb talents, is to create a new legend of the Old West (or more accurately, the Old South).  A new American myth as iconic as the real historical figures or any of Clint Eastwood's characters.  A film this memorable, an instant piece of our American culture, is a rare feat, and Django Unchained is worthy of that status.  Jamie Foxx, of course, deserves a great chunk of the credit for for bringing Django to life with the intensity that has shaped him into an Oscar-worthy actor.  But underneath that brooding, vengeance-filled intensity is a thin veneer of humor to remind us of Django's humanity.  I like his story, including the aspect of a person able to snatch Opportunity from adversity - the rare kind of opportunity which lets one discover who they were always meant to be.  Speaking of opportunity, I also enjoyed the opportunity for Leo DiCaprio to really cut loose in a role like he did with Calvin Candie.  Playing villains allows one to fully tap and explore a wild side.  Most protagonists have to restrain parts of themselves, and these are roles DiCaprio mostly portrays.  He's played angry & intense characters,  but none have quite let him unleash an erratic and amoral personality quite like Candie.  Christoph Waltz, I believe, was truly the best actor in this film, which is saying a lot considering his co-stars' performances.  But I loved his smooth-talking, intellectual character with an innate sense of justice that may or may not conflict with the laws and social mores of the country in which he operates.  Kerry Washington's performance was also solid, as was Samuel Jackson.  Like DiCaprio, he so rarely plays villains, especially calculating sniveling characters like Stephen.  I delighted in watching him pull that off spectacularly.  But Stephen is where the crux of my criticism lies.  Django Unchained is obviously a Magnum Opus for Tarantino, an epic to rival that of the Kill Bill movies while paying homage to spaghetti westerns of yore.  But even at almost 3 hours, you can feel Tarantino had to cut much of the story he intended to tell.  I wish he had found a way to split Django into a series of films because, again even at nearly 3 hours, this felt rushed.  I felt like some of the characters' stories were incomplete or discarded.  (I still maintain my theory that Stephen was the real power behind the Candyland throne and Calvin was just a front.  I really believe Tarantino intended this, but switched it to the current version for time or whatever).  You could argue the incomplete characters are hints at a much larger world of which Django and his adventures are a small part, adding another complex layer to this film.  I'd say that's a good argument, but it still doesn't shake the feeling that some of the storytelling art was cut for the sake of time.  That brings us full circle to why Django Unchained is such a good movie.  Even after nearly 3 hours, it imprints itself on our memories, leaving us wanting more, hoping to see or read more about Django and his world.",

Stylistically taking off where Inglorious Basterds left us (OTT historical fiction) Tarantino exclusively follows Jamie Foxx's Django from his break for freedom with Dr. King Schultz (played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz) through to his bounty hunter training and subsequent attempts to free his slave wife from the clutches of Calvin Candie. DiCaprio's Deep South slave plantation owner is another highlight in a film of great performances including Samuel L. Jackson's phenomenal turn as Stephen, Candie's entrusted and apologetic aging black slave. The acting is clearly top notch throughout and Tarantino's controlled direction and blinding score makes the (rather lengthy) 2 hours 40 minutes run-time a joy trather than a pain. With the amazing soundtrack accentuating the emotional journey, Tarantino has made a brilliant film and in this reviewer's eyes, the best since Pulp Fiction. Django does Entertain!

An indication about the ignorance versus intelligence of innocence was made clear in the story telling part - minute 47. Furthermore in that part, several interpretations of freedom and love are also possible. Of course, all of the above review is just more than what Tarantino's films deserve. Creativity sometimes is being marked upon simplicity. As to newly celebrate a black protagonist, it quite raises the orthodox question of whether spotting discrimination is racism or not.

I wanted to like the film very much and kept waiting for some convincing, if stylized storytelling . The principle fault was pacing, which was pokey and slack. Genius though his dialogue may appear on the page, or the computer screen, Tarantino doesn't seem to have learned that film dialogue, even the conversation we consider \"literate\" or \"bright\", requires a ruthless efficiency.\n\nThe constant references to the cheesy tics and tacky tropes of old exploitation movies in the work of Tarantino as passed the point of being homages, tributes displayed in new films that, in themselves, are legitimate extensions of durable genre. Cringe as he might, Tarantino has created his own kind of formalism, a post-modern template in which the borrowing of elements from other films is no longer a clever, brilliant and innovative method of transgressing boundaries and revealing but has rather become what seems a knee-jerk response to a challenge to make a certain kind of movie. I agree with the assertion that there is a certain clubhouse knowingness about his films that distance the typical viewer from enjoying his films; the genius of genres is that the true masterpieces in Western movies, war movies, crime dramas, et al, is that they go well beyond the expectations of hard core fans and appeal to a greater audience that recognizes something greater than the mere satisfaction of genre expectations. To coin a phrase, the cliquishness is a buzz-kill and is, I think, more than cynical in attitude. All this mix and matching , bric-a-brac, and pastiche mongering assumes, by design, that surprise is no longer possible with film narrative and that what film makers need to be are little kids taking a hammer to the toys they are bored with. That is not my idea of a fun date.\n\n The characters here, especially those played by Christoph Waltz and Leonardo diCaprio, chatted up considerable dust storms of hyperbolization that would the dialogue equivalent of a jazz soloist improvising for too long .This is at the sacrifice of momentum, a quality that isn't achieved in \"Django Unchained\"- try as I might to suspend my disbelief, I was never convinced that the inevitable reckoning would result in the catharsis that even a hipster variation of a Jacobean revenge tragedy requires as a matter of form. Humanity and all its layered awfulness--lust, greed, avarice, revenge, slavery, racism, all those rotten instincts that create tension within individual characters who try to abide by codes of honor, decency and respect who then are transformed into somethng much uglier and wrathful--are summarily smothered by Tarantino's heavy hand and instead used as premise-giving props as the writer/director hits all the generic marks. In doing so, QT seems like a less than agile man learning how to dance, following the shoe prints laid out on the floor, \"...one, two THREE, one, two THREE...\"",

Tarantino's natural instinct in film-making seems to be to exaggerate, and Django Unchained is no different. His use of blood is hysterical, creating a volcanic type eruption whenever a bullet strikes its target. Furthermore,Tarantino uses the N-word as often as he believes he can get away with, yet, I don't feel he over-stepped the mark. Tarantino films must always be watched knowing that what you are about to see is not trying to be a true depiction of the era or subject involved. It is simply Tarantino's take on the subject, and nearly always poking fun. Take Kill Bill for example, the action sequences are ridiculously unrealistic, with QT clearly making a joke about martial arts films. I feel something similar is happening with Django Unchained, as Tarantino writes his own history.\n\nThe film opens to a pair of brutish slave-traders who are dragging a chain-gang of black men across Texas. Next enters Dr King Schultz, a stylish German-born bounty hunter. Schultz dispatches the slave-traders in a superbly calm and comical style, and off he and Django, released from the chain-gang, go together. When Django explains he is looking for his German Speaking wife, Broomhilda, Schultz becomes entranced and agrees to help find and free Broomhilda, who happens to be under the ownership of plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).\n\nChristoph Waltz follows up his excellence in Inglourious Basterds by delivering another phenomenal supporting performance, and a deserving winner of the Golden Globe. However, the stand-out performance was that of veteran Tarantino favourite Samuel L. Jackson, as Stephen, the housekeeper of Calvin Candie, and the most evil Uncle Tom. \"Who dis nigger up on dat nag,\" is the reaction of Stephen seeing a free black man, and also the audiences introduction to Samuel L. Jackson. From his introduction onwards, Samuel L. captures every scene with his quick-wit, contagious laugh, and dark betrayal of Broomhilda. The character of Stephen perfectly highlights Tarantino's ability as a screenwriter, as the large portions of dialogue, mixed with the outbursts of violence, manage to successfully captivate the viewer.\n\nTarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction, one that should definitely not be missed.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n9/10.",

Dr. Schultz was one of those 'I-can't-believe-he-just-did-that' characters that you, despite yourself, start to really like throughout, despite his kind of warped, almost psychopathic sense of humor. Jamie Foxx did good throughout, of course, playing first the unwitting accomplice to this mad dentist and turns into an emotionless, vengeful killer. DiCaprio for once played a character you HAD to hate, really going against his pretty-boy image, which was hard for most of us who watched to adjust to. And then there's Samuel L....what the heck! Came off as a bratty little butler who had his master by the coat-tails, which would not have happened. He was smarter than his own good. Not a stand out performance for him; it didn't work. The story line was well thought out, though very, very gruesome, portrayed the time they lived. Seemed very drawn out, though, and a lot of the fluff could have been cut (the long survey of DiCaprio's land, for instance). Overall, a good movie, but not everybody's cup of tea",

I think the movie feels very long at moments and that makes it drag a bit in a lot of scenes. Nonetheless the film has a strong opening and a spectacular third act. The entire third act makes the film worth your while alone. I know I'm going to sound pretentious for saying this but I also was hoping the film had more action since it was being noticed for its violence and western style. Still there are a few action scenes and they are stunning for sure. Ultimately, I think this a fun movie that drags in places but has enough to back that flaw up.",

            "content": "Django Unchained, Quinton Tarantino Unleashed:\n\n\tSet in 1858, the last 2 years of the antebellum era, we see the Django played by Jamie Foxx marching in a slave chain gang when Dr. King Schultz, a bounty hunter liberates him in a most hilarious way. That is, by killing one of the slave traders and injuring another. When describing these actions, it shouldn't be funny by any standards yet, the genius and style of Quinton Tarantino makes it so. Quinton himself went on the other side of the camera to give us a brief but very explosive performance. I'm belly laughing at people getting shot, maimed, and blown up as if I was watching Looney Tunes. But there's plenty of drama and character development to enjoy as well. We see Django transforming from a timid slave into the confident bounty hunter sidekick to Dr. Schultz played by Christoph Waltz. And we see Dr. Schultz haunted by the atrocities of the antebellum era. \n\nI really enjoyed seeing Christoph Waltz playing the polar opposite of his SS character in QT's 2009 Inglorious Basterds, while maintaining his Austrian accent. Equally as delightful was Don Johnson who rejoined the QT team (see Machete 2010). Hopefully we'll see him as well as others to be regulars in Mr. Tarantino's movies. Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant as the Slave owner/Mandingo fighting promoter and with the introduction of his character, Calvin Candie; the brutality escalates exponentially and with historic accuracy. But still Quinton's movie style goes from a horrific brutal scene to a humorous moment at light speed. In fact at one point I unintentionally drew attention to myself as I laughed just a little longer and a little louder than the rest of the audience at the cartoon like demise of a slave mistress. I won't give \"another\" spoiler by describing the scene exactly, but I thought it was one the hilarious moments as only Quinton can do with this subject matter.  \n\nDjango is further evidence of genius arising from humble beginnings. Not bad for a boy who started as a video store clerk. I'm just glad I was one of the polite customers who always rewound.",

It's entertaining, jarring, and very emotional.\n\nThe cast was great - acting superb. \n\nThe only thing I questioned was the music at points - some of the music took me out of the element but that's minor.

This films centers around ex-slave-turned Bounty Hunter, Django Freeman and his mission is to find and rescue his estranged wife from Calvin Candie, a slaving owning business man of his own worth. With the help of Dr. King Schultz, he might as well be the \"fastest hands in the south.\" I was downright pleased with the love and admiration that went into making this film. Not a single moment, was I ever bored at all. The time and setting was WELL respected. The action bits were well choreographed. The pacing was well timed and it didn't feel like it wasn't dragging at all. Tarantino is really famous for putting tremendous amount of character development and dialogue in his films and it clearly makes a great return in Django Unchained. The performances were stellar with Jamie Foxx as Django being all badass, Leo DiCaprio being a great Southern %$$hole (hence the time and setting), Sam Jackson just being awesome. Yet, out of all of the performances, Christopher Waltz was probably the most thrill seeking. His expressions, his dialogue, and his motives tells us that he is in no position to mess around. When he wants a job done.....he gets the job done. Hell, his beard looks like he wants to kill someone. The soundtrack is well placed and doesn't feel like it was just there for the sake of being there. The music gave us that classic Western flare that films like any of the Clint Eastwood Westerns. Hell, Western composing master, Ennio Morricone provides the score in it and it doesn't disappoint. So, I have said enough about Django Unchained and I advice you to go and see it. In fact, I am actually going to see it again BECAUSE of how good it is.",

It reminds us of the horrors of the slavery era (though done many times already), and of course, adds the usual Tarantino twist to it, and the usual sly dialogue (Jonah Hill scene was the best imo).

The film has nothing to do with Sergio Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western Django apart from Jamie Foxx's character sharing the same name as Franco Nero's character in Corbucci's film. Franco Nero even shows up for an appearance as do a number of other familiar actors that were cast in the film. Tarantino is inspired by the Spaghetti Western genre (some original material for the score was composed by Ennio Morricone) and Blaxploitation films, particularly films like Mandingo(1976) set in the antebellum American South. Just as Tarantino thought that Hitler and his ilk got off too easy in WWII and turned Inglorious Basterds into a revisionist revenge fantasy, he thinks the Nabobs and their ilk in old South got off too easy and constructed another revisionist revenge fantasy here. I have no problem with that. I have never been a big fan of Jamie Foxx but he is good here, playing a gunslinger who like all good Spaghetti Western heroes is better and far cooler than his opposition. Still, its Christopher Waltz playing Django's benefactor, partner in bounty hunting, and friend who gets all the best lines and won an academy award for Best Supporting Actor. Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson, and even Don Johnson are having a ball playing bad guys in this film. Tarantino's script gives them all terrific lines. But the best moment for me was when the great Franco Nero meets Jamie Foxx in a saloon. He asks him his name and Foxx replies, spelling out the name and explaining that the \"D\" is silent. In a classic \"Fourth Wall\" moment Nero replies \"I Know.\"",

The reason a love this film so much is because Django unchained is a very powerful, daring film and Quentin Tarantino himself knew before it's release that this film was going to be VERY controversial, and that it was. The film is about an African american slave, Django. Now the characters who would be considered normal (Back in the time this was set) are actually the characters we despise while the characters who are lower class (and often mistreated) are the people we hope will take a stand, what the film does in a way is make the audience hate the 'Normal' characters because we know (As an audience) what many people did to slaves was wrong.",

        {
            "content": "The tenants of classic spaghetti westerns are found within all of Tarantino's work leading up to his latest film Django Unchained (2012) - his first actual western.  Prior to this pre-Civil War flick, Inglourious Basterds (2009) was essentially a western set \"once upon a time in Nazi occupied France\".  Basterds featured music by the legendary western composer Ennio Morricone (The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly etc), a classic story of revenge, Mexican stand-offs, scalping, war-paint, dynamite, and bad Italian.  What made Inglourious Basterds even more special was that it was a movie about the power of film (physically and metaphorically), and it is that below the surface layer that made Basterds not only entertaining but something greater than just an action comedy (these elements were also hallmarks of Tarantino's most famous film from 1994, Pulp Fiction).  With Tarantino's love for cinema and infatuation with the western genre, Django Unchained feels like the film Tarantino was always bound to make yet something feels off.\n     Django Unchained follows a newly-freed slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) and a German bounty hunter by the name of King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) as they travel together through the antebellum south in search of the Brittle brothers who are wanted dead or alive for stagecoach robbery and murder.  Along the way, Django reveals to Schultz that he intends upon saving his wife from the roughest plantation in the south: Candyland.  Coincidentally, Django's wife is named \"Broomhilda\" (Kerry Washington) which captures Dr. Schultz' attention since there is, as Schultz recounts, a German tale of a damsel in distress named Brynhildr (pronounced \"Broomhilda\") who was in need of a hero and was saved by the brave Siegfried.  Schultz, admiring Django for being a \"real-life Siegfried\", decides that he will help his new bounty hunting accomplice in his quest.  Thus begins the classic hero complex: a hero with a want, a damsel in distress, and a dragon that must be defeated.  The dragon is a young and wild man (comparable to the unruly George Minafer in Orson Welles' 1942 film The Magnificent Ambersons) in the form of plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), hence the name of his plantation \"Candyland\".  \n     Upon arriving at Candyland, the film takes a vicious turn as the true relationship between slave owner and slave is depicted with shockingly real brutality.  The merciless torture and unflinching murder of slaves in cruel and unusual ways is incredibly off-putting (as it should be).  It is nothing about Calvin Candie's stature or demeanor that is frightening, but rather it is within his appetite for cruelty and violence that Candie becomes a menacing phantom of the everyman plantation owner (or every-plantation owner).  The character of Candie makes slavery and slave owners despicable, but he also makes the people who stood idly by watching him commit his acts of hatred against his property for years just as guilty.  The lukewarm are just as guilty, and are treated as such in this film as Django strikes vengeance upon the oppressors of African Americans with furious anger.\n     Dr. King Schultz becomes the white conscience of the film as he witnesses the gruesome murder of a slave who was too afraid to continue being forced to participate in \"mandingo\" fighting (a gladiator-esque fight to the death between one slave and another), and throughout the film he is haunted by the images of that murder.  Like Travis Bickle in Scorsese's 1976 film Taxi Driver, Schultz feels empowered to \"clean the streets\" after witnessing all the horrible atrocities that take place on the plantation.  Armed with a spring-extending gun in his sleeve, just like in Taxi Driver, he takes his own violent stand surprising his fellow white-man with a bullet to the chest.\n     The vicious turn that the narrative in Django takes is a twist that never occurs in Inglourious Basterds - a film about a squad of Jewish-American-soldiers on a mission to end WW2 early by scalping and beating all the Nazis in their path to death (including Hitler and his cronies), but we never see our protagonists get harmed.  Had we seen images of the holocaust in the film, it would have been a much darker film and would have had a similar feel as Django Unchained in regards to the depiction of slavery.  Django at times feels like a rehash of Basterds.  It's racial revenge by the victims of oppression.  Another key difference would be the degree of victimization that the protagonists experience in their respective films.  In Basterds, the protagonists are indirectly affected by the evil of the Nazis as they have never experienced the cruelty of a concentration camp.  However, In Django our protagonist is beaten and abused numerous times in the film (and so are his peers).\n     It's interesting that filmmaker Spike Lee is so opposed to Django Unchained, claiming that \"I can't speak on it 'cause I'm not gonna see it.  The only thing I can say is that it's disrespectful to my ancestors to see that film.\"  In all reality, Django Unchained feels like a companion piece to Spike Lee's breakthrough film Do The Right Thing (1989).  In Do The Right Thing, the temperature and racial tensions are high in modern day Brooklyn as everyone gets fed up with each others' differences.  At the end of the film, Mookie (Spike Lee) chooses to lead an angry mob of African Americans to burn down the Italian antagonist's pizzeria instead of killing the owner, and in which by burning the pizzeria down they are destroying the establishment that embodied the ideals of their opposition.  Sure, Mookie chose the lesser of two evils (property destruction over murder), but these actions are reflected in Django Unchained as racial tensions escalate to a violent boiling point concluding in the destruction of the plantation.\n     This film is a major platform for discussion concerning the ethics of the characters and the history of our nation, but it didn't leave a nice taste in my mouth.  The first half of the film is so rich in character and feels like a true western, but the second half (which begins with a mandingo fight) is marred with hip-hop music, brutality, and poor decisions.  Characters choose to act violently, like their slave owners, instead of making peace - a conscious decision that Quentin Tarantino explained while on Charlie Rose on the 21st of December.  It makes for great entertainment, but it brings to mind an interesting plot device that justifies brutality in Inglourious Basterds: it's an alternate reality.  Basterds defies history by changing the way the second world war ended, where as Django stays within the bounds and confines of history (within a fictional narrative), but it makes the violence feel unnecessary.  Revenge was not his mission: Django only wanted to save his wife from the dragon of slavery, but instead he stays around and kills everyone (all the lukewarm observers of cruelty and the remaining white plantation work hands). Sure, violence is a \"trademark\" of a Tarantino film, but it fails to serve the logic of the character of Django.  Had Inglourious Basterds been a metaphor for American slavery hidden within the veils of a cinematically charged depiction of WW2, perhaps it would have been a greater vessel for this story, but it would have spoiled the charm of Basterds.  \n     Frankly, Django Unchained isn't very enjoyable, and with all the issues within the film, Tarantino's predictable wit and humor can't save it.  Lots of western imagery (not enough though), blood and guts (too much), and laughs - but it's a hesitant laugh.",

It is also well-acted with Foxx, DiCaprio and Waltz on the top of their game. But QT is no film-maker and cannot edit. 2h45m i'll never get back.\n\nWe get it QT, you love the Spaghetti Westerns. I have no problem with the Morricone rifts, sudden zooms and close-ups. But the blood-soaked spectacle of death was both ridiculous and boring. Its cartoonish, and its repetitiveness smacked to me of a film that had spiraled out of control.\n\nThe problem with QT and Django is tone. An epic KKK attack degenerates into farce when they start arguing about whether they can see out of their hoods. Some may laugh, I thought it bad taste. QT pops up at the end, bloated and with a confusing accent. Summed up this film perfectly.",

The soundtrack was perfect, and although the movie dragged on in parts--particularly the scene featuring Tarantino himself--i felt I'd witnessed a great story by the end. Also, Tarantino's use of understatement when dealing with weighty issues like slavery and racism was a refreshing change. We all know slavery was bad--films dealing with the topic do not need to persuade us of this; Tarantino, to an arguably exploitative and purely shock-value level, merely SHOWS us the horrors of slavery, trusting his audience to deduce the rest. And lastly, Samuel L. Jackson's role as Stephen was a phenomenally rounded part, allowing a different perspective to the deeper issues of the film. But if nothing else, this is a bloody, hilarious, and so-crazy-but-you-can't-help-liking-it kind of movie!",

This was a much darker period in America's history and very much the world's, not to be taken lightly but also not to be missed, definitely a return to form for one of cinema's most treasured modern maestros.",

Jamie Foxx is badass in the role of Django, the slave turned bounty hunter who teams up with a German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz, who is supposedly a dentist, but hasn't practiced dentistry in over 5 years is played by the brilliant Christoph Waltz who is such a scene stealer that pours out Tarantino's dialogue like poetry. Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic as Calvin Candie, the Mississippi slave plantation owner (also known as Candieland in the film) who Foxx and Waltz try to rescue Django's wife Broomhilda played by Kerry Washington, who is a lovely and an emotional presence in the film. Watching her and Foxx together again for the first time since \"Ray,\" just proves that they are one of the best on screen couples right next to DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in \"Titanic.\" Samuel L. Jackson is also great as DiCaprio's house slave Stephen, who is without a doubt as Jackson put it himself is probably going to be \"One of the most hated Negros in America cinema.\" But let's not also forget the surprising and good performance by Don Johnson as Big Daddy, one of the slave plantation owners of Tennessee, that Foxx and Waltz trick into thinking they want to by one of his slaves in order to track and kill the three Brittle Brothers that Waltz's character has a bounty out for and also whipped Kerry Washington's character after Foxx's character pleaded with not to at the last plantation that he and his wife were together at before being separated after trying to escape. The soundtrack that Tarantino has created for the film is one of his strongest since \"Pulp Fiction\" in my opinion.",

            "content": "Quirky and violent western that tell us the story of Django, a slave that is bought and freed by bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz. He recruits Django as he is the only individual capable of identifying some wanted criminals. Eventually the pair become business partners and friends. But Django only yearns to find his wife from which he was separated after they both tried to escape. After some enquiries they find out that she was sold to Calvin Candie, a rich and merciless owner of the big plantation Candieland. The pair made up some story about being scouts of mandingo fighters and infiltrate in the plantation hoping to buy Broomhilda back. But their charade doesn't go as planned and hostilities arise.\nThis is one of the most original westerns I have seen recently. Never before a black character was at centre stage, maybe a few in the background but never with that sort of strength nor skill, and never in the position to legally kill white folk, let's not forget that this is also a drama about slavery and social position. It is refreshing to watch something truly unusual.\nCritics and reviews said that the movie was too long and too violent. I think it was long, but not excessively, there were no empty scenes nor pointless dialogues, the dynamics of the plot needed quite a lot of footage and to make justice to the story the film had to be long (2 and a half hours).\nI quite agree though in the violence department, the use and abuse of the splashes of blood and exploding brains was most unwelcome and completely unnecessary. Of course there are going to be graphic shootings, torture and all sort of aggression but Tarantino has overdone it this time in that department. It is my only criticism to a movie that has got almost everything else right.\nI liked Tarantino's humour; I enjoyed the scene with the Southerners masks, it is hilarious but, at the same time, sounds as something that could have really happened, and that makes it perhaps even funnier.",

I think he is a great actor, but his character just didn't feel right in the movie.  Two, Kerry Washington's character could have been highlighted a little more in the movie, detailing her escape from the Candie plantation and reason for her being in the 'hot box'.

DiCaprio is the perfect villain, Foxx is cruel and merciless, Waltz provides excellent comic relief, and everyone inbetween is absolutely fantastic. I especially liked Samuel L. Jackson's performance, once again showing that, as an actor, he has no bounds. Whether you're a fan of Tarantino or not, you'll find something to enjoy in this movie. I highly recommend it.",

I have seen many films cover some strange grounds, but when I heard this movie was a take on westerns and blaxploitation I was hooked. If you love Tarantino films well this is another to like then. I already feel like watching this movie again and it's near 3 hours long. Now that is not a complaint at all the run time is fine. If the film can take you in then you cannot have any problems with the run time. We got some great acting of course from Jamie Fox, Dicaprio, Samuel Jackson, and an actor who is reaching as one of my favorites Christoph Waltz. Waltz won awards for his performance and I can clearly see why, but it's very hard to compare and contrast to everyone else. Jamie Fox pulls off a stoic main character who soon gets a chance to break free and boy he does. Dicaprio gives another charming performance, but he has a lot of darkness this time and when his turn happens it left me stunned. Samuel plays someone who will surprise you, the trailers play out perfectly to leave things to be shocking. Then Waltz is the funniest character and my favorite cause he gives a man a chance of freedom and he does a lot for him. Now the best part of the film is the humor. For a movie that was covering these two genres I wasn't expecting to laugh so much. There are many funny scenes and they don't ruin the movie at all, it's probably one of the best sense of dark humor I have seen for a long time. It is a perfect blend of western, blaxploitation, humor, and gore who man there is gore! Tarantino keep up with your blood effects because I will never get bored of them!",

Foxx takes himself so seriously there'd be no room for anyone else in the movie except that he is effortlessly blown off the screen by the charismatic Mr Waltz, who always seems to be having fun.

The director's skill at blending gritty realism with juvenile absurdity is unparalleled, and he fully embraces the weird, wonderful fusion of art and junk that gives all great exploitation films their shameless potency. Fueled by a bitter, righteous fury at America's unpalatable past, \"Django\" is a gleefully irreverent, outrageously indulgent masterpiece, and Tarantino's best movie since Pulp Fiction.",

At 2:45, it's a long running time, but it's so solid, you won't be clock-watching (although, I still think they could have probably trimmed down about 10 minutes...  but that would have pretty much been with Leo, and with his star-power, that probably wouldn't' fly).

            "content": "With any Quentin Tarantino film the expectation is always going to be at its highest. So what starts off as a new good looking film from QT turns into more of an event. Django really did live up to my expectations and I hope any other QT fan out there thought the same. When he first announced the release of Django Unchained, I thought okay another meaningless title, what is it going to bring and is it going to be as good as his previous films, is this is where it goes down hill for Quentin. Really I was just being pessimistic. Because yes it was just as intriguing as any other of his previous films. Quentin's love for cult cinema is commonly unknown by many, which was why I knew there was a western being loaded into the Quentin cannon anytime soon. He mentioned in one of his interviews that a big inspiration to him was Sergio Leone and his classic spaghetti western 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. So to see Quentin tackle the ethics of the western genre made the release that much more of a double event. But strictly speaking Django isn't a western. If anything it should be tagged as a 'Southern' coming from the man himself. It has nothing to do with the western genre. \n\nUnlike Inglorious Bastards, Django doesn't try to be a riot and doesn't try to be as politically correct as possible (referring to WW2). It concentrates more on character development, pointing at Django (Jamie Foxx). For the first time in Quentin history the story is more linear and concentrates on the portrayal and the story of one character's journey. Also there are no shifts in time like Quentin's previous films. We don't see Travolta being shot by Willis and then reappearing in a later scene which is based before that scene. This doesn't leave you so confused but that doesn't mean you're not left confused at times during the film. After all that is QT job. Which is why as Quentin fans we need to see the film another two to three times to get the full QT experience. Also we don't get 'Chapter 2' or anything like that. Django goes for the more 'Rescue the princess' type theme. The story sees Django a slave being \"Unchained\" by a bounty hunter slash dentist Dr King Schultz (QT latest discovery Christoph Waltz) who won his deserved Oscar for Inglorious Bastards in 2009. However over the campfire he is amazed to know that Django is married to another slave called Broomhilda Von Shaft (Kerry Washington) even though Foxx and Washington played a couple in Ray. \n\nNow as this is a 'Rescue the princess' film, there is a villain. Django Unchained's finest element is the new Robert De Niro, AKA Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie. A plantation owner in the south. Who keeps slaves including Django's love. QT tries to make him a perfect, spiteful, prone to flattery, selfish, vain man who wants nothing else but money. But the result is naive and funny which doesn't disappoint. Now me being negative. Quentin's attempt to include black comedy leaves the viewer slightly confused and doesn't want to know why they are confused either. I know there has been some controversy on the films running time and frankly it is not long ENOUGH. It flew by for me and I feel that some scenes could have been longer but I have a hunch they were shortened for the best. But other than that the only other advice is don't watch the trailer as it doesn't do the film justice!\n\nIn conclusion Django Unchained is a delight to watch from two hours before the film starts to the end credits. Verdict: Another bloody, well scripted masterpiece that QT has fed to our hungry eyes. Django really does help define QT as one of the finest directors in modern day filming. The only issue now is, can he keep it up? Either way this film of course gets an A+.",

Containing a great story, terrific performances, good dialogue, and brilliant pacing, Django is Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction, and that is really saying something.   The story of Django Unchained is that a black slave turned bounty hunter named Django is going after a plantation owner that has his wife. The story is told in a great way that only Tarantino can do, I  can't explain it really, but the story is so fascinating I was always interested to see where it was going. It also uses its setting to great effect, along with great pacing that keeps moving at a fast pace, you will find this story's setting just as interesting as its colorful characters and gorgeous visuals, or the gripping balls-to-the-wall action scenes.   With its all-star cast containing big names like Leonardo Dicaprio, Samuel L Jackson, Jamie Foxx, and many others you know that they are all going to pull off their roles perfectly. And boy do they ever, especially Leonardo Dicaprio who plays one of my favorite villains in recent memory, and Jamie Foxx is a natural fit for this character. Their dialogue is well written, but there is one problem with the dialogue and that is the constant usage of the n-word. While I understand that people back then used that word very often, I still could've done without them saying it every 30 seconds. However, that is a relatively small complaint.    Django Unchained is a insanely entertaining western that I hold on par with Tarantino's best film: Pulp Fiction. It's brilliant mix of action, dialogue, setting, visuals, and storytelling ensures that this is one film that deserves all the praise it has been receiving. As for Spike Lee's stupid criticism: I didn't know who he was till he said what he said, and he looks like a fucking moron for saying it. This film is pure awesome.",

Waltz deserves his Oscar as his portrayal of Dr. King Shultz is on e of the best acting jobs I can recall from recent memory. Django Unchained is typical Tarantino ultra-violent fare and at times it works and at other times it doesn't. The movie can be downright disturbing (the Mandingo fight and the dogs) but Tarantino goes about his work without hesitation and provides viewers with a fun, exhilarating, funny and unflinching look at slavery and revenge.

I love all of Quentin's movies but they keep getting smarter and more entertaining. While I'm scared to use the word \"realistic\" when talking about this movie, it definitely feels more real than some of his past titles (Kill Bill, Inglourious Basterds). The characters are, as always, extremely entertaining. Quentin always brings the best out of his actors, and maybe that's because he just writes such great characters for them. The theme for the film is vengeance, which is the usual for Tarantino. He follows the Tarantino style as you can expect, but he doesn't fail to throw in a few surprises. He also isn't afraid to stay true to the times with the word **** being thrown into every other line of dialogue. I'm glad he didn't shy away from this because, as someone familiar with history, it wouldn't have felt right. The dialogue is fantastic, the pacing is terrific, the action is spectacular, and overall it's a very entertaining movie. I can tell already that a few racist or ignorant people are leaving bad reviews because the film pokes fun at them, so be weary about bringing anyone like that to see the movie with you.",

It is astonishing that QT is able to take a subject as sinister as the treatment of many African American slaves during the nineteenth century and turn it into a film not only honorable of the subject matter, but as great of a story as Django is. In the midst of much of the underlying torment in the context of the film, Tarantino is once again still able to deliver a movie that is both riveting and hilarious. The genius of this film is only further cemented by its exemplary cast. Leonardo DiCaprio plays an outstanding role as one of the wealthiest and cruel plantation owners in the South--so believable at times, it is scary. Jamie Fox also plays his role terrifically, giving the film the hero it deserves. Even the role played by Samuel L. Jackson is utilized very well. However, the role played by Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz is simply sublime, and is a shining example of why he is becoming one of my favorite, if not my favorite, actors to date. Django is sure to become another Tarantino classic.",

Tarantino leapt to center stage of American film making with Reservoir Dogs and cemented his reputation with Pulp Fiction, but it's time to face facts; sometimes there's two flashes in the pan before it's over. Tarantino, like Coppola, Cameron and Lucas, has lost his creative edge. Viewing a Tarantino film, one must expect violence by the ton and language that would make David Mamet wince. But, unlike the grievously over-rated Mamet, one also expects Tarantino's wit. The only humor here is a rip on Blazing Saddles with the overused racial epithet. I'm not a fool.

He simply doesn't deliver average films and 'Django Unchained' continues his wonderful work. Set in the Deep South and Old West, a freed slave (Jamie Foxx) embarks on a trail across America with a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) to rescue his wife from a charismatic and cruel plantation owner (Leo DiCaprio.) The sequences are sensational from the very beginning but the key component in making this film so great is the two intriguing characters at the heart of it, Foxx and Waltz. Inglorious Basterds was a marvellous movie and I thought that Waltz was the shining light and once again he steals the show. He really is an actor on top of his game under the stewardship of Tarantino and he excels. Compared to other Tarantino outings the film is much more linear excluding less flashbacks. Some will complain about the elements of racism but it's part of what Tarantino is tackling with Django. Foxx proves to be a hit in the lead role and delivers a solid performance. It was a genius piece of casting having Leo DiCaprio as the villain. He is a supreme talent and possibly the finest actor of this generation and once more he is in flawless form as the villain of the movie. As usual Samuel L. Jackson makes an appearance and he, as always, is ever dependable. There's also cameo's from the Director himself, Tarantino and Jonah Hill. Django Unchained is without a doubt one of the best films you'll likely see all year round. It's a must see film and another masterstroke from Quentin Tarantino! It has everything you'd expect from one of his films. The laughs are their in abundance, the actions sequences are superb but there's also the serious issues of racism and slavery at the heart of the tale. And to top it off, there's a stellar cast as always delivering oustanding performances. It is a bit on the long side coming in at just under 3 hours but it's a journey you just have to take all the way through to it's grand stand finish! Make no mistake Django is another work of magic from the maestro that is Quentin Tarantino.",

Quinten takes his blood-spattered historical tent show on the road, putting down stakes in Antebellum Dixieland. Not technically a \"Basterds\" prequel, \"Django\" stems from a similar impulse, to reframe and rewrite American history in boldly absurd strokes. \"Inglorious Basterds\" is an exceptional film, but \"Django Unchained\" surpasses its predecessor, and then some.\r The movie opens in 1858 Texas with the unorthodox purchase of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), by a dentist-turned-bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christopher Waltz). Since Schultz doesn't believe in slavery, he soon frees Django and the two become partners in Schultz's business. After a profitable winter, they head to Mississippi where their goal is to locate Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). When they succeed, they find an excuse to be invited to the plantation where she is being held. There, they are guests of the mansion's master, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), where their act bamboozles everyone except Candie's personal slave, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), who smells a rat the moment he sets eyes on Django.\r When Tarantino first introduces audiences to the two characters we'll come to embrace and respect, it's while Django (Foxx) is chained up to other slaves as they march slowly in the dark in the middle of nowhere. Dr. Schultz arrives playing the role of a dentist in a scene that's close to being as perfectly written and delivered as Waltz' farmhouse scene from \u201cBasterds,\u201d freeing Django and thus begins a reluctant partnership. What starts as an uneasy alliance in which one side holds all the power, transforms over the course of the movie into one in which the unlikely pair become partners and friends. Delivering this transformation along with character development, Tarantino is at his screenwriting best.\r There is not a single misstep by any of the \u201cUnchained\u201d cast. Led by Foxx as a slave-turned-bounty-hunter, and Waltz as a man with more layers than initially revealed, this ensemble is a perfectly cast with everyone at the top of their games. \u201cDjango\u201d is an absolute must-see for Tarantino fans, but it's not necessary to be into either Tarantino or just Westerns to be fully entertained. There are many notable cameos: Don Johnson (small part), Jonah Hill, Amber Tamblyn, Bruce Dern, Tom Savini, Robert Carradine, and Franco Nero (who played the lead character in the unrelated 1966 film, Django).\r Tarantino is one of the few filmmakers that seamlessly and successfully merges style with substance. He is a creature of cinema, unashamedly standing on the shoulders of greats, forging new meaning out of the universal cultural experiences. That is why as far as I'm concerned \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d is one of the best of 2012.",

However this film is so much more than homage to the westerns of old. Tarantino has truly outdone himself with this script (a rarity amongst action films these days) with period appropriate racism themes throughout as well as a story that keeps wondering whether the plan will work out in the end. The action in this film is amazingly over the top with blood splattering everywhere and heads exploding left and right. It is almost like Tarantino has used the violence to compliment the style of the film because it looks like good old fashioned special effects. The music in the film is great adding to the atmosphere when playing or purposely omitted.

Throughout the movie, he breaks down the formula to a creative film and rewrites it completely. This is a film that starts with title cards, opening credits that aren't merely forgettable blips on the bottom of the action, a song named after the titular character, and all the other components of the typical spaghetti western. The revenge-fueled plot and the character archetypes also evoke images John Wayne and Clint Eastwood films.\r Strangely enough, however, rap music and sunglasses badassitude trickles into this \"Southern\". Tarantino, of course, writes in his own style. Excessive (almost cartoonish) violence befalls all characters, the dialogue-only scenes are abundant, and depictions of the pre-Civil War South are brilliant and ominous. Tarantino gives the film a unique atmosphere that I haven't seen since Kill Bill. Django Unchained pulls you into the screen and makes you feel like you are living in the cartoonish, wit-smitten world of the film. I truly felt for Django's quest and was intrigued by the story of his German liberator King Schultz.\r Speaking of, the characters in this film are outstanding. Tarantino has always been a character writer, but Django and Schultz may be the best film duo I've ever seen. Each character is interesting on their own level (the introduction of Schultz sparks one of most unexpected and entertaining opening scenes in history), but it's the interaction between Django and Schultz that's most memorable.\r Leonardo DiCaprio's villain Calvin Candie is especially potent, to the point that I hated the actor himself for a time after seeing the movie. A slaver with a excessively playboy demeanor, Candie is essentially a hilarious, despicable character that sets up the pieces to introduce the film's true antagonist: Stephen, the head house slave of Candie's plantation (played by Samuel L. Jackson). I can't say too much about this character without spoiling the movie, but it's definitely one of Jackson's scariest roles.\r The climax is one of Tarantino's best, I was never bored while watching the three-hour long movie, and I'm still thinking about the characters and the plot today. This is a movie that I will want to rewatch again and again. I have pre-ordered it from Amazon, and I rarely buy things from the Internet.

Jamie Foxx is the title character, a slave rescued from servitude by a German bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christopher Waltz). In exchange for helping him track down and kill various wanted men, Schulz agrees to help Django rescue his enslaved wife (Kerry Washington) from Candyland, a plantation owned by the sadistic Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio.) Tarantino has a knack for bringing out the best in actors, and DiCaprio in particular shines among a field of diamonds, playing Candie with marvelous antebellum gusto. Samuel L. Jackson said he wanted to play the most hated Negro in cinematic history, and he most certainly gets his wish here. Stephen, Calvin's racist house slave, is a truly despicable character, in a movie filled with them. This is an extremely violent film: fountains of blood erupt onto the screen during gunfights; a runaway slave is torn apart by a pack of dogs; eyes are poked out; skulls are bashed in. None of this should surprise anyone who has seen either of the Kill Bill movies. If gratuitous violence bothers you, do not watch this. I wasn't bothered, though. All the violence is directed towards slave owners and their enablers, and, frankly, they deserve to die. Even if you're an adamant pacifist, you can't deny Tarantino's virtuosity. His style of film making is just so fun to watch. The dialogue is a joy to listen to, as is the music. Even when an anachronistic rap song starts playing, you don't mind because, somehow, it fits right alongside the flamboyant guitar instrumentals and Johnny Cash's god-fearing country. Django Unchained, though simplistic and borderline cartoonish at times, is a supremely satisfying piece of film-making. Movie buffs rejoice: Tarantino is back, and he's not pulling any punches.",

This movie is truly spectacular in nearly every aspect. The dialogue is fantastically written as its both very witty and humorous. Even though comedy isn't on the genre list, there's a lot of comedy, mainly dark, in this  - which becomes beneficial for comic relief purposes because the movie has many intense scenes and the movie is pretty long. The acting was superb. Almost everyone gave a strong performance. Samuel L Jackson played the old, bitter man to perfection. Jamie Foxx showcased that he could play a multidimensional character that expressed many different emotions. While I'm not fond of DiCaprio, I must admit his first performance as an antagonist was well-done and really blended into the the character he was portraying. And Christoph Waltz truly deserves an award for his performance. Everything about it was brilliant. The timing, mannerisms, facial expressions, body language, believably, you name it. The only performance I didn't care for was Kerry Washington's. Her performance was lacking emotional investment. In other words, I didn't fall in love with her character. But still, her character didn't overshadow the movie's brilliance or even stand out like a sore thumb. It was just mediocre. Like many Tarantino movies, this had a lot of blood, violence, gore, and all that good stuff. That said, the movie isn't for people who have a weak stomach, but it is indeed for anyone who's a sucker for realistic  blood and gore. In fact, it will make blood seekers go berserk. After all, let's just say it will make many of his films look peaceful in comparison. The plot and narrating  were both crafted well, too. They both keep you guessing what direction the movie is going. An the directing, of course, is just superb. The camera shots, the timing, the choice (plus timing) for the music, the envision of how scenes should look like....... everything was choreograph extremely well.

Not only one of the best but my favorite movie of the year. Underneath the bloody, revenge, slavery theme of Django Unchained is also a love story. Django's only priority in this story is rescuing his beloved wife from the \"evil\" hands of Calvin Candie (Dicaprio) and his loyal black land owner Stephen (Sam L. Jackson). The Western genre is one of my, if not the most, favorite genre of all movie genres. Spaghetti westerns are even superior, in my opinion. So I knew all the little homages Tarantino placed in this film. Including the original Django, Frank Nero, in the same scene with Jaime Fox's Django. These small features of the film just added more fun to my experience not to mention how well the comedy blended while in this portrayal of a dark horrific time in America. The songs used in this movie, MY GOD! Every song fitted so well into the scene it was introduced. The soundtrack is just another reason why Quentin is so unique when it come to film making. From Ennio Morricone to Rick Ross to Jim Croce everything was blended spectacularly to its southern setting.\rTo say the acting is great is a bit of an understatement. Jamie Foxx plays such a fantastic lead as his character develops from a shy slave to the fastest, ballsy, gunslinger in the south. Christoph Waltz, like in Inglourious Basterds, steals every scene he's in with his witty charm and his lovable character's way of escaping out of a tight spot very unexpected. Leonardo Dicaprio gives another great performances and probably one of his best. A very flamboyant evil character at that. Now Samuel L. Jackson just blows it out of the park by a long shot. He gives such an astonishing performance as great as on the level of Jules in Pulp Fiction. He steals the scenes from the scenes Christoph Waltz is in. He was by far the most evil and outrageously funny character in the entire movie. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this role. Kerry Washington is great but is not the usual strong female performance you usually get in a Tarantino film. Probably because of the plot and its setting in history. All the secondary characters were flawless as well, including Jonah Hill's comedic small role. I adored everything from the stylized beginning to the showdown in the end. Even the small little details to the actors Quentin uses in his movies like Charles Parks or himself. I honestly found more humor than any comedy I've seen this year. The heavy use of gore and buckets of blood is exactly my taste in movies. Does it drag on? Of course, in the second act it tends to drag on a bit which is probably the set up of Dicaprio's character development. As a fan I wouldn't mind it being five hours long but as a reviewer perspective it could have been trimmed just a tad bid. The death scenes were a spectacle to experience. I was in awe from every death scene. I have to give this masterpiece a 10/10",

Characters, though not at snappily witty as in Tarantino's other films, are more complex, thought-out people than in Tarantino's other films. Samuel L. Jackson's character, who on a surface reading is a thin parody of the house slave stock character, becomes a much more rich and complex character when you look not only at his actions towards Django in the film, but consider his motivations and his general role at Candyland. I can't decide if he is ultimately a villain, is stealthily mitigating the abuses of the plantation, is simply spiteful, or if some of his more villainous-seeming actions are a poorly-executed attempt to aid Django, in his way.",

It really brings to light the absurdity of slavery and the rampant ignorance found across the country on such an issue. Whites, blacks, Asians, Latinos--ALL ethnicities sat in the theater together laughing and cringing collectively. It's over-the-top Tarantino at his best. In comparison to Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is much more balanced, maintaining sharp dialogue and awesome action that audiences have come to love. If this were a truly offensive flick, as critics seem to point out, Django would not have had such excellent actors play lead roles, and the NAACP Image Awards would not have recognized it with such acclaim.

What makes this film great is how he can get away with the in your face subject matter, while still leaving the audience laughing at every comical moment. Like a lot of QT films it starts to feel a little long midway, but it picks back up in phenomenal fashion. People who go see this flick and not expect over the top gore are fooling themselves. This isn't a heavily dramatic depiction of the evils of slavery, if you want that you should go see Lincoln instead. Instead it assumes your already aware of how evil slavery was and creates a comedic action satire story of the good angry black guy out to get revenge against a horde of evil white slavers. This isn't his greatest flick, but its the best he has done in a long time. Well worth going to go see, even for people not that into Tarantino flicks.

I know QT loves violence in his films but really, I couldn't watch the scene with the dogs or the Mandingo fight.  There is also a scene discussing KKK hoods that seems right out of a Mel Brooks movie rather than Tarantino but it was hilarious.  For me, Christoph Waltz was the best thing about the whole movie.  I hope he and Tarantino continue to do more films together - it's a perfect match.  The film may have been written for Waltz as he is a German actor, and speaking German is a key component of the film.  There are strong performances from DiCaprio and Jackson as well.  Great directors get great performances from their cast.  All in all, a great combination of humor and violence, plus a strong depiction of slavery and its atrocities.",

Django isNot  everything in Tarantino's filmography can be as good as Pulp Fiction or Basterds. For me Django falls a little short of those lofty expectations, but a pretty good Tarantino film is better than most movies in any given year. Django is gonna get a lot of comparisons to Basterds because they are both revenge fantasies at their core. While that may not be fair it is natural given the very similar plot arcs. While I still think I would have preferred Bastreds if it had been made second because of two of the best scenes ever put into  film, it is hard to say because Django did feel familiar while Basterds felt like something you had never seen before. There is still plenty to love about the movie. As usual this film is very dialogue driven with biting humor and some dark overtones. Nobody in film ever uses dialogue to build tension like Tarantino and there is plenty of that at work here. Performances are great almost across the board, especially Waltz and Dicaprio. Foxx gives a nice, understated performance as Django. My only beef with the performances was surprisingly Jackson. Although I think that is more a product of the character than his performance. If the usual Tarantino stylized violence is your cup of tea, there is enough of it on display here to get your fill. For me this movie goes off the rails just a bit in the final third. I never felt like Tarantino knew how to end this film and it ended uo being the weak link in another very good Tarantino vehicle.",

It has a faster pace than most of his movies, and when I say that, there's really only one scene that has a normal amount of Tarantino dialogue. (Tarantino likes to have VERY long scenes of just dialogue, but builds a lot of personality) There was some great  laughs in the movie. The real kicker was that, yes Jamie Fox was the star, but he is certainly not the one to be watching. Leonardo DiCaprio and Christoph Waltz stole the show and played their characters perfectly. Overall, if you like Tarantino, you should defiantly see this movie, if you don't or haven't seen or heard of Tarantino, its still worth seeing, even if its only once.",

You really think Tarantino would make such a mistake?\rI loved the movie, the acting, the story (that is quite different from the style of any other Tarantino movie), the way he mixes all kinds of genre (comedy, drama, action, etc) and makes the movie get so interesting you want to watch it again, and again and again. Besides i didn't like the fact Django turned out to be the Cowboy image (come on, it would be awesome if he was just the free slave getting his vengence without this whole american western cowboy hero thing), Tarantino made an impressive screenplay with an impressive acting work. For the violence, some people complain about the absurd amount. For me, Tarantino can ude it the way he wants, that at the end, it's going to be good, more then any other violence movie.",

Unfortunately, for as much as it pulls you inTarantino could really have made \"Django\" something rare in which stylish performances could meet an alluring script in the middle of the hard-core Western environments that stay true to its time. Unfortunately, for as much as it pulls you in during its impeccable first half, it takes away in the next with its glacial pacing and its overly-brutal actions sequences. While the performances remain strong throughout, Tarantino's direction does nothing to hold on to what kept my interest in the first place, which was Foxx's transformation from a born slave into a natural bounty hunter. Watching Foxx share the screen with Waltz as they outsmart, outmaneuver and obliterate their targets in the most entertaining way they know how is stunning in its amusement. This is perhaps why I am so disappointed with Tarantino's change of heart somewhere half way through the movie. The lighthearted tone assigned to the characters takes an ultimately darker turn which takes away what made \"Django\" tremendously fun in the first place. The fight scenes also become downright disturbing half way in as Tarantino strains up the gore to such an extent that the scenes themselves no long seem to be enjoyable. I realize that hardcore Tarantino fans would prefer nothing else, but I am just saying make sure you have a decent stomach. Despite the fact that \"Django Unchained\" loses a lot of its steam early on, I simply refuse to dislike it because of its robust insight towards the time period, DiCaprio and Waltz's powerful performances and for Tarantino's ability to write an energetic script even if his direction doesn't suit it perfectly.",

Looking to give him a fresh look, I watched Django Unchained on Netflix. Better than Hateful 8\u2026but not by much. QT has psychological hang ups; African-Americans and the history of blacks , the word **** and Samuel Jackson. The latter is a really good actor but really .. every film ? As always , DiCaprio is a treasure. Bad,bad man. Deliciously played. The acting overall was solid as was the story line but the problem is QT excess and self indulgence. Since Pulp Fiction , the first 1/3 of his movies are really good, often comical , the middle 1/3 o.k. and the last part excessively violent and senseless. My new slogan is \"just say no to Tarantino\" .",

Made perfect for the whole \"slavery\" concept, using modern legal talk so the audience can perfectly understand. Great acting, great voices, great surroundings, great climax, badass action scenes. You get the idea, it's the best Quentin Tarantino I've ever seen (my opinion).\r It also has some decent humor, and some okay slow moments. But the action truly stands out. Samuel L.
