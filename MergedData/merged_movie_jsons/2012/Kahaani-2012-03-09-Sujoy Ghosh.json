            "content": "Leave your bag of popcorn outside the theater. You would honestly not have the time to crunch it as you watch this fantastic film with bated breath. For Kahaani is a ride so thrilling, your mind would be tripping with a million possibilities, even as your tongue invariably ends up either tied, or hanging in the air with anticipation.Kahaani is essentially the story of a heavily pregnant London based Tamil woman's search for her missing Bengali husband in Kolkata, underplayed exuberantly by Vidya Balan. The supporting cast comprises a helpful cop Parambrata, a selfish detective - Siddiqui, an eccentric life insurance agent - Saswata, and a bhadralok Police officer - Khwaraj, and last but not the least, of a 300+ year old city - Kolkata seeped in the throes of celebrating the mother of all festivals - Durga Puja.The film unfolds like the pages of a gripping novel by Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes and is shot like that of an Alfred Hitchcock or a Satyajit Ray. Using real people, places, and situations to underline the nuances of the story is a task that's handled brilliantly by director Sujoy Ghosh (also the co writer) whose recent claim to shame - an abysmal Aladdin, or a horrendous Home Delivery shall soon be forgotten just as Madhur Bhandarkar's debut dud was.In addition to the sterling performances and the plot is the terrific technical support. Be it Amitabh Bacchan's rendition of Tagore's 'Ekla Chalo Re', the background songs (mostly of RD Burman), playing innocently as the characters travel the length and breadth of the city, the costumes by Sabyasachi, the 'just right and yet dramatic' background score, the non-condescending cinematography that captures the city as if it were a character, and the supreme screenplay with a spattering of real Bengali, act as just the right spices to turn this into a delicious dish, that's both exotic as well as commonplace.Watch this film to experience something so satiating, you would surely ask for more (a rare for a thriller!). I give this a 10/10 not just because this is one of the best thrillers ever made in India, but definitely one of the best films to have ever come out of Bollywood. Kudos to the whole team! Trust me! Ami Sotthi Bolcchi!P.S: Please do not discuss the story with anyone else, unless they have watched this film.",

            "content": "Kahaani directed by Sujoy Ghosh is one of the most finest,efficient thrillers I have witnessed in recent times.The first half may be a bit stretched but still its good but it is the second half that keeps you engaged thoroughly and the climax is superb.Story:- Vidya Bagchi(Vidya Balan) playing the helpless , who has arrived from London to Kolkata in search of her missing husband Arnab. With a sympathetic cop helping her on this mission, Vidya combs every corner of Kolkata. But all leads go cold \u2013 the guest-house he was staying at, the National Data Center where he'd been assigned, even the Indian immigration authorities have no records of Arnab Bagchi. When it seems like her husband's disappearance might be inexplicably linked to a most-wanted terrorist, Vidya pokes her nose around in dangerous places, angering the Intelligence Bureau that is trying desperately to keep some secrets hidden.Sujoy Ghosh,who directed the disastrous Aladin in 2009, is excellent this time.Although there are many sequences in Kahaani which work,but since mentioning them would spoil the fun.The screenplay is taut and brave.The dialogs are very good.The editors could have trimmed the movie,to make it more sharper.The cinematography by Setu is stunning.The locales of Kolkata are a treat to the eye.The music is very good.\"Ami Shotti Bolchi\" sung by Usha Uthup and \"Ekla Cholo Re\" sung by Amitabh Bachchan stand out.Performances:- Vidya Balan rocks in Kahaani.She is an actor to watch out for.She is amazing.Parambrata Chatterjee as Rana is sweet.Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Khan,the Intelligence Bureau officer is superb.Saswata Chatterjee is good too.Special mention of the two boys,one in the Mona Lisa hotel and the other as the tea vendor are cute.Amitabh Bachchan's narration at the culmination is fine.I am giving nine out of ten for Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani.It is not only to be watched for fans of Vidya Balan but it is also for those who are not.Its your loss,if you miss it.",

            "content": "Genre --- Suspense, DramaReview -- Kahani is indeed a worth for your money. A sincere effort to portray an incredible story, which would leave you baffled, would leave you keep guessing what is going on and what would happen next. We have seen several suspense movies that have a good build up but are utter disappointing in the end. Even after the climax, it would keep surprising you till last shot. Truly a nice movie that you can with you Family and kids without hesitation. No abusive language, no \"story Ki demand\" type intimate shots. A clean and gripping storyline. I liked that fact that story did not pushed a possible romantic element neither unneeded songs between characters and kept it straight and focused.Story of Girl (Vidya) looking for her missing husband, is just the start. Movie is shot is Kolkata with characters that are real, you can relate and can smile to natural gestures. Movie keeps you clutched to your seat. Its a story of nice people stuck in their own mess up routine, offer help to the pregnant lady. Even with new actors, jumping in with their cameo every now and then, each has done full justice to their role.The story has been wisely written binding intelligent writing along with actual Kolkata.Verdict-- If you have been awaiting for a Good Bollywood Flick, with original narration and quality acting, the movie worth's every penny. A pleasure to watch with family or friends.Music -- Consists of two songs, different from stream line cinema. Amitabh Bachhan has brought a new spirit to Rabindra Da's \"Ekla Chalo Re\". The other song -- \"Ammi Shotti Bolchi\" is a authentic rock song on Kolkata theme in Usha Utthup's evergreen Bengali voice.Rating -- 8.5/10http://bollywoodwaale.com/movies.php?movieid=14Anjaneai",

            "review_title": "... The Changing Face of Indian Cinema.",
            "content": "Let me say right now that this is not your usual Bollywood run-of-the-mill. If you are expecting typical Bollywood masala with hide and seek romance, dancing around trees, superhero fight scenes and 'filmy' dialogue, you will find it in the remaining 999 films that the Indian film industry has on the 2012 assembly line. What works for \"Kahaani\" is its atypical narration arising from a well written story, first class cinematography in tandem with good soundtrack, and the performance of a leading actress whose very mention signals the changing face of Indian cinema.Arriving from London, a heavily pregnant Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) heads straight to the Kalighat police station in Kolkata to enquire about her missing husband. With the help of Rana (Parambrata Chatterjee), a rookie cop, Vidya begins to unravel the mystery behind her husband Arnab's disappearance. Together, their investigation leads to dead ends, but not before learning that Arnab may be linked to a terrorist agent operating as a mole within the Indian Intelligence Bureau. Wrestling with this possibility, Vidya finds herself digging into a high profile federal cover-up, even as an assassin trails her every move.Co-written by director Sujoy Ghosh, \"Kahaani\" is a well crafted thriller that is simply too good by Bollywood standards, current or past. Gosh has not only set a new benchmark in Indian cinema, his overall production quality is far superior to some of his counterparts across the globe. Even so, the true mettle of his work is in resisting the temptation to glorify India's stand on terrorism through nation-wide propaganda. Instead, Gosh pays close attention to the screenplay and how it develops through the narration. Pacing is consistent with a serious tone, but well punctuated with some suspense driven moments and subtle humor when you least expect it. Another strongpoint is in keeping the audience guessing all the way to the diabolical twist in the end. To avoid spoiling the surprise, I will just say that this could be borrowed from a certain Angelina Jolie film, but be that as it may, the conclusion here is totally unpredictable and forms the icing on the cake. There are some factual and chronological goofs but there is no point going there because no film is 100% perfect.Dating back to the late 17th century, cinematography captures the historical essence of one of India's oldest cities \u2013 a 300 year old artifact if you wish \u2013 in superb celluloid rendition. Gosh gives Kolkata a pulsating heart without unnecessary exaggeration, while simultaneously capturing the hustle and bustle and nooks and crannies of the city with deft camera work. Using this huge backdrop along with the festival of all festivals, The Durga Puja, Gosh underlines the film's formidable theme of motherhood in seamlessly integrating the fragility of a woman with her in-built yet God-given power to sustain life. From joy to heart-wrenching sorrow, Vidya Balan personifies this ideology with perfection. Fresh off the critical success of \"The Dirty Picture\", Balan is emerging as a powerful force in female driven plots. While this could very well change the perception on Indian cinema, this a welcome change and one that is long overdue. I am smitten as I am awestruck. Also worth mentioning are Parambrata Chatterjee as Rana and Nawazuddin Siddiqui as a difficult IB agent. Together, their roles add vital support to Balan's as well as holding up the plot structure.As this is my first Hindi movie review, I only hope that I have given this movie the recognition it deserves. Considering my fondness with all things Hollywood, Ms. Vidya Balan and director Sujoy Ghosh have renewed my faith in Indian cinema. I cannot wait to see Balan's next movie. Watch this space.",

            "content": "Who would expect that someone who directed 'Home Delivery' could create magic. Sujoy Ghosh's 'Kahaani' is a mouth watering treat for any movie lover. Right from the very beginning till the end the tight narrative keeps the viewer on his toes without any hiccups whatsoever. Starring Vidya Balan as Vidya Bagchi(Bidya Bagchi) as a wife who is in search of his husband Arnab Bagchi and in its course arrives in Kolkata all the way from London even though she is pregnant. The story follows her search at the same time playing with your mind with many twists and turns. After a long time have I seen a film in which every actor has given a peach of a performance and thus requires a special mention. From Parambrata Chatterjee who plays the role of inspector Rana who helps Vidya find her husband to Office Khan played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui to even Saaswata Chatterjeeas who plays the serial killer Bob every one is brilliant. I am really looking forward to more actors from the Bangla film industry to shine in Bollywood. The script is tight with loop holes you don't even bother worrying about and to add to that the haunting background score that gives you the true feeling of a thriller. Though it awkwardly seems a bit longer than its 2 hour running time I still won't mind watching it again. And yes Vidya Balan our very own Meryl Streep is almost certain to get another filmfare and national award. Of course the year has just started but i might just be disappointed if she doesn't get it. Ha! really satisfied with Kahaani.7.5/10 for Kahaani and another 0.5 for the collective acting performances of the cast. Audience which included a lot of family and friends - 3.5/5",

But he has given one of the finest cinemas in Bollywood with his latest flick. He has shown the true Bengal as one of the characters in this movie. Really splendid to watch some of the scenes shot in the cityVidya Balan is giving her best to date in all his recent movies. She hasn't failed yet. One blessed actress she is for the industry. No doubt even if she collects a national award every coming year. such a talented actress. So brave to chose such difficult scripts and make it look like cakewalk in the end is just amazing.All the characters in the movie have done justice to their roles. Every one complementing each other, the script the story & the direction. The climax is just so powerful and will give you goosebumps. Not seen like in Bollywood before.

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Kahaani",
            "content": "The film begins in 2008, where we bear witness to an unnamed man whose identity is hidden behind a gas mask, experimenting with a lethal chemical gas on lab rats, before we get to the city of Kolkata where the same weapon of mass destruction got used in a terrorist attack on a subway train that unfortunately wasn't stopped in time. This almost stand-alone setup and prologue will keep you guessing its significance to its story, since the film continues two years later, where Balan's Mrs Vidya Bagchi arrives in the same Indian city from London in search of her husband Arnab (Abir Chatterjee), who as a software engineer worked at the National Data Centre and maintained daily contact until his sudden disappearance two weeks before, with the uncharacteristic cessation of contact prompting his wife to travel thousands of miles to look for him.Worried, the heavily pregnant Vidya heads straight to the local police to file a missing persons report, and from there starts to visit some of the regular joints her husband could have been in, including his hotel room which had absolutely no traces of the man, nor with people she encountered at those places having any recollection of having seen him, based on their hastily taken matrimonial photo. Assisted by policeman Rana (Parambrata Chaterjee), a slight, mild mannered cop, they soon stumble upon an investigative web filled with unanswered mysteries, and a bewildering suggestion that her husband may not be who he had claimed to be all along. The name Milan Damji gets floated about, a government agent in the mould of Jason Bourne, who may hold the key to Arnab's disappearance, again with clues that he may be more than meets the eye, and at this point your imagination will start to run wild as to the myriad of possibilities the story written by Sujoy Ghosh could turn out.Ghosh also takes on directing responsibilities, and he has crafted one heck of an engaging thriller amongst some of the best I've seen with scheming twists and carefully plotted turns involving government officials, beat cops, and Intelligence Bureau officers led by the non- compromising Khan (Nawazuddin Sidiqui), who epitomizes a no-nonsense approach with a willing streak to sacrifice pawns to nab the king. With Vijay pushing for the truth, a slew of bodies start turning up courtesy of a hired killer set loose to silence everyone she talks to, giving rise to that sense of danger and death at every wrong turn, it's a closely matched up cat and mouse game everyone seems to be playing against one another on both sides of the law, with Khan's questionable tactics giving rise to the propensity of collateral damage authorities are willing to suffer for the sake of the greater good.But Ghosh also remembered to balance his superb thriller with emotional anchors, and does this brilliantly through his crafting and development of the protagonists Vijay and Rana, whom we journey together in their search for facts and truth. They play off each other's strengths like Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, with Rana's unassuming disposition balancing Vijay's sprightly nature and relentless determination, making this one of the best cop- civilian pairing I have ever seen as well, being all natural and therefore believable. Credit has to go to Vidya Balan for her sensitive portrayal as a woman hell bent on tracking down her loved one and seeking closure to the sudden mysteries in her life, and Parambrata Chaterjee for his portrayal of a man taking it upon himself to help, and unwittingly finding himself being attracted to and infatuated with someone he has sworn to protect as well. It is this forbidden attraction and romance that's underlying and brewing that he brings out well without going over the top, exhibiting loads of sentimentalism that worked wonders for their chemistry with each other.Production values are top notch. I absolutely love the gorgeous city of Kolkata which I've seldom seen in Indian films, and here we weave in and out the crowded, bustling city area and into much laid back neighbourhoods, with a fantastic capture of very natural misc-en- scene being a lovely ode to the city, featuring its sights, sounds, people such as the working class from tea sellers to master craftsmen, and festivals. Production designers Kaushik Das and Subrata Barik ensured a very natural look and feel, while cinematographer Setu didn't impress me much with his shaky cam technique that had plagued too many Hollywood films he tried to emulate, but thankfully the second half of the film decided to ditch that misguided documentary feel for camera work that's more sustainable and traditional. The music by Clinton Cerejo and Shekhar Ravjiani worked extremely well in the background without bringing in too much attention to itself, nor do we have jarring breakaway musical interludes to blunt the storyline. Such is how everything worked together to complement everything else in the making of the film, to churn out a result that's worthwhile of repeat viewings for clues that one may have missed the first time round. It's filmmaking and storytelling at its best, and even I was more than glad to have decided to watch this instead of postponing it. Kahaani propels itself into my shortlist as one of the best this year, and it is certainly highly recommended if you're desperately looking for an intelligent story, great performances, a film that went the whole nine yards in its desire to become a classic.",

Yes this is one of those movies that lingers on in your head even after you leave the movie theater.The star cast right from Vidya Balan(as Vidya Bagchi),ParambrataChattopadhyay(as police offer Satyoki Sinha/Rana),Nawazuddin Siddiqui(as second-in command Intelligence Beaureu),Saswata Chatterjee(as a hired assassin),Kharaj Mukherjee as a kind cop to the manager of Mona Lisa hotel and lastly the two kids who interact with Vidya is simply amazing.There are several high points in the film.Vidya as the portrayal of the pregnant woman delivers a range of emotions.She is at times tough and firm on finding her missing husband.At times, she is vulnerable,frustrated because of the missing clues. She is charming in the way she talks with the kids and playful in the bus-ride with officer Rana.Then the subtlety with which Rana emotes the love he feels for Vidya and the hesitation while picking locks to find out evidences.The brash hard talk act by officer Khan and then the evil menacing act by Bob Biswaas.Brilliant!!Moreover Sujoy Ghosh(the director) uses Vidya's pregnancy cleverly- every time she trips or even sweats too hard, you become afraid.The story totally grips you and leaves you at a dramatic high.And what can I say about the climax.Tremendous shock value!There have been very few times when I have experienced such pin-drop silence in the theater.Take a bow Sujoy..You have given Bollywood a gem of a thriller.For those fed up with the dark and gritty underbelly of Mumbai and the bylanes of old Delhi in recent movies, there are splendid sights of Kolkata and the iconic Durga Puja.It's a treat to watch the Howrah bridge,Hoogly river and the Victoria Memorial.Regarding music.Its great.The movie starts on a good note with \"Ami Shotti Bolchi\" and Amitabh Bachhan's rendition of Tagore's famous song \"Jodi tor dak shune\" elevates the mood to a completely different level.The director keeps the narrative clutter-free, sans any songs or side-track.Kahaani shows that when everything falls in place for a film \u2014 story, writing, acting, editing, cinematography, etc \u2014 things can't go wrong. Kahaani is one such film; everything's right about it.Watch Kahaani. Period",

            "content": "Setu's account of Kolkata is delightedly sincere and not superfluous cinematography - the dynamic colours and the simplicity of the artless lanes of Kolkata, admiringly, have not been lost in rhetoric black and white. The same forthrightness has mirrored to a huge extent in Suresh Nair and Sujoy Ghosh's masterful and impressive narration of Bagchi's fable of lost and deeply lost until found.Vidya Bagchi's (Vidya Balan) hunt for her lost husband Arnab Bagchi (Indraneil Sengupta) brings her down to Kolkata from London. With a seven-month old baby magnifying her power, an infinite exploration of the byways of Kolkata with the help of a local policeman Satyoki Sinha (Parambrata Chattopadhyay) begins. Disordered links and remainders of Vidya's past conversations with Arnab are her fragile hopes. Undeterred, the firewall specialist rummages through the tightly encrypted codes of the mystery, webbed by even more securely encrusted faces. The refreshing combination of Parambrata and Balan and the motley of emotions and the ease with which they exude them in \"Kahaani\" make for an outstanding watch. Balan's ability to tailor her sentiments - sympathy, anger and despair - multiplies the strength of her character. The swiftness of the movie leaves no time for the audience to mentally prepare for an upcoming situation. While Vidya accepts herself as \"Bidya\"in the City of Joy, gifts a chocolate to the kid in the lodge and breaks the lock of National Data Centre; the contract killer Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee) playfully murders people and Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) smokes out his dedication towards his work besides a mouthful of white air. Just when a wide array of emotions are at their peak and the frantic search is riding high, Amitabh Bachhan's rendition of Tagore's famous song \"Jodi tor dak shune\" transfers the mood to a completely different level. The festive mood of the city, the preceding and the succeeding of it, the red of sindoor and the expressions of the idols of Durga have been phenomenally well-utlised in the movie. Balan is a breeze of fresh air in Bollywood, which is suffering from the curves of furniture heroines and \"Kahaani\", another robust step after the recent \"The Dirty Picture\" towards reinforcing the position of heroines in a traditionally hero-driven Bollywood. The subtlety with which the soul of the city has been interlaced in the screenplay, while not losing grasp on the flow of the story even for a moment, is a testimony of effectual storytelling. There is not a single scene in the movie where Parambrata has been overshadowed by the presence of Balan. His acting skills are distinctly sharp and flowing. Sujoy Ghosh's choice of actors for the various characters in \"Kahaani\" has made an immense contribution towards the kind of impact it leaves on the viewers long after they abandon the theatre. After all, \"Shotti\" sounds better as \"Shotti\", not \"Sotti\". The climax, even though prudent and reasonably well-baked, is slightly dramatic and seems to conclude the movie before clearly justifying the actions of Vidya and Satyoki, especially the latter. The momentum of the story towards the end beats its own record and the circumstances merging with the mood of the city seems to be not so much of a coincidence. Bagchi's \"Kahaani\" is one of those that would define tougher standards for the forthcoming Fridays. Why on earth would you like to miss the benchmark? Watch it. Definitely!",

            "content": "For the first time ever, I think I'm docking 3 points just for the cinematography alone. At its heart, Kahaani is a compelling story with strong acting and good character depth, as well as a clear tone and effective disturbing moments and imagery, such as that of the rats being gassed by an apathetic psychopath in the opening frames to set the mood for the rest of the film. The characters may not be fantastic as one might expect from a masterpiece of a film, but they certainly are effective in the film, and the acting from our lead actress Vidya Balan rises far above the film's shortcomings.My main gripe is with a very simple part of the cinematography. There is simply way too much shaky cam to the point of becoming nauseating. There's very few moments in which the camera stays still, and when they happen they seem to be by coincidence or by mistake since even the dullest moments and the most extreme bits are shot with exactly the same constant shakiness. This film seems to have taken to heart one of the worst tropes plaguing Hollywood films nowadays, and though it takes several that make the film look much more well-paced and stylish than the typical Bollywood romp, this one trope does more than undo what good was done with the cinematography. Back when Michael Bay's 13 Hours came out, I felt like it might be the first Bay film I enjoyed, but due to some inappropriate shaky cam, I had to drop it, and this film is much higher in quality with much much worse shaky cam.That being said, there's plenty to like in the film. The setup is very cleverly manipulative for a thriller film. Having our main hero as a pregnant woman is one that sounds ridiculous in premise, but her motivation makes a lot of sense, and what results is a pregnant hero being in the last situation they should be in. The story, while not too thought-provoking, has enough twists and turns and revelations to keep it from being dull and unimaginative. It sounds cliche and silly, but I found myself more invested than I felt I should have been, and for that reason I have to give the film a positive rating.Though I'm sure this film might seem really unique for Bollywood fans, it feels really familiar for me here in North America. That being said, it's certainly better than most films going for this style aside from the obnoxious shaky cam.",

            "content": "A perfect noir or thriller is like a Cornetto Ice-cream which you start licking with excitement that doesn't fizzle away in the course of your action. In fact temptation gets multiplied as your taste bud is surprised with hidden nuts, choco chips, wafers along with added flavor which makes one forget about everything. In the very end one finds that unexpected solid chunk of chocolate whose aroma stays in your mouth for hours. Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani is one such taut thriller that will engross you with interesting twists and turns gradually reaching the climax that takes a complete somersault. From the very first scene of a man in a gas mask testing some lethal chemicals on rats in a lab, Kahaani has you gripped. And then enters Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant women in an unknown city in search of her husband Arnab Bagchi who is a scientist working in NDC, Kolkata. There lies the mystery as from every corner Mrs Bagchi is proved that her husband hadn't been to this city. Even his existence seems to be a mere figment of imagination. Things get complicated as IB department of country shows interest in the case. Revealing a single suspense of this gripping thriller will be a crime and it is must watch for all lovers of suspense thriller. Sujoy Ghosh's script as well as direction is restrained yet poignant with metaphors revolving around Maa Durga and her fight with Asura (the demon). It is one of the rare scenarios where the script and the execution respect audience intelligence. In fact the ending compels the audience to revisit the scenarios and then one realizes the dots do connect. That's the most successful poi of this riveting thriller which can be compared to best of the thrillers in the world. The cone of this Cornetto is city of Joy Kolkata who is the true protagonist of the tale. The violence lurking in the by-lanes of the city, the mystery flowing with the murmuring sound of the Ganges, there is an air of conspiracy and Ghosh's script rightly captures that. Ritesh Shah who wrote the dialogs of the film deserves mention to consummately penning down the thoughts of Ghosh. Thankfully there is no clich\u00e9 involving Kolkata which were shown in earlier film made on this city. Adding to the beauty there is Setu's camera-work which portrays Kolkata like never before in Hindi celluloid. Ghosh is gifted with brilliant technical team who did their best to make a captivating thriller in such a shoestring budget. Namrata Rao is another \"hero\" of the film. She gave the razor sharp cuts much needed in a thriller like this and her editing abilities will surely get her phone ringing for more thrillers. The background score did the much needed haunting effect to compliment the proceeding without going overboard. There are two songs in the film. \"Ami Sotti Bolchi\" which is there in the beginning is kind of introduction to the city as well as story. Usha Utthup's voice creates the aura of suspense. Amitabh Bachchan rendered his voice to Tagore's \"ekla chalo re\" which somehow worked. Vidya Balan is the pillar of Kahaani. Her character V(B)idya Bagchi is epitome of strong quintessential woman who is strong to take care of herself and at the same time vulnerable to regular emotions of life. This is the role which actresses will die for and luckily the role chose Vidya Balan who is beyond competition. One of the finest actress of our generation she can display any role with perfection. From Ishqiya to Paa, No one Killed Jessica she went a notch higher with The Dirty picture and now sealed the top spot with \"Kahaani\". She deserves the best actress awards once again. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the loud mouthed IB office Khan had superb screen presence. His voice modulation will lead him to such meatier roles in near future. Parambrata Chatterjee aptly cast as Inspector Sinha added the soft side to the story with his unsaid love for Vidya. He was powerful even when he didn't mouth any dialogs through his expressive eyes. Saswata Chatterjee as Bob Biswas was scene stealer. Whenever he landed on screen people knew something is going to happen and with his expression he just stole the show. One of the finest actors in Bengal today, he must get noticed after this brilliant performance, in national circuits as well. His scenes with Vidya in the metro station just prior and after the interval are one of the best sequences of the film. Revealing his character will die down certain elements of suspense. Kharaj Mukherjee as podge thana head was adequate and provided some comic relief without getting too loud. Indraneil Sengupta, Dhritiman Chatterjee, Darshan Jariwala, Falguni Chatterjee (as manager of Monalisa lodge) let their presence felt. Special mention to the two kids who can give the big stars run for their money. Kahaani again proved Story is the real winner. If you have a good story you can compromise on budget and still make a engaging film. Kahaani should become a guide book for those who want to make thrillers. With Agent Vinod,Shanghai,Talaash on the cards hopefully good thrillers will revive in celluloid. Till then salute to the whole team of Kahaani and hope Sujoy Ghosh forgets his \"Alladin\" days and make another thriller as riveting as Kahaani. Watch Kahaani and experience neo-bollywood \u0085\u0085aami sotti bolchi!!",

It is several notches above the stuff we've been subjected to in the past. The movie triumphs in evoking emotions. You experience compassion, resentment,defenselessness and triumph at a variety of stages.

Two years later, a very pregnant Vidya Bagchi from London arrives to search for her missing husband Arnab Bagchi. Police officer Rana helps her on her search but they keep running into dead ends. At Arnab's work, she finds evidence of a doppelganger in missing employee Milan Damji. The search triggers assassinations and more road blocks.This movie has a solid Frantic start except it's inferior in various aspects. I do love a pregnant woman as the lead and Vidya is a very compelling actress. The story showed too many of its cards too soon. At least, that's what I thought at the time. The convoluted story moves quickly enough that the logic of the situation can't be examined. With the final twist ending, it's obvious that this is like a magic trick where the magician is turning over his playing cards to distract and misdirect. It's all a trick. Everything that didn't seem right is overshadowed by the final twist.Many have compared the ending to The Usual Suspects. For sure, I didn't see it coming. One must remember that TUS is a tale told by the unreliable narrator. So any inconsistencies are simply lies. In fact, the twist is that it may as well be all lies. That's not the case here. It's hard to separate possible logic holes with the characters' misdirection. For example, I noticed the strange wiping down by Vidya which made no sense at the time. Of course, the twist explains the wiping down but upon more careful reflection, it becomes questionable again. Essentially, that's how I feel about the whole movie. I keep wondering if the characters' actions actually make sense. If the point is for a pregnant woman to be overlooked as she does the search, does it make sense to have a police officer be her partner everywhere. That's the opposite of the original intent. If one doesn't dig too deeply, this all makes sense but I don't know if it can withstand some real digging.",

            "content": "There are a few movies which will keep you glued to the screen. You will be sitting on the edge of the seat and your mind will be making a million possible permutations to deduce what will happen next. Very few of them come from Bollywood. If ever there was a blockbuster movie from Bollywood, Kahaani is better than that. Read on to know why Kahaani is a must watch.Plot: It's a crowded metro. Hundreds of travellers are waiting to reach their destination. They are killed with a chemical weapon. Two years later, Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) is a pregnant woman comes to India in search of her husband, Arnab Bagchi (Indraneel Sengupta) who has been missing. She can't find a trace of him and is determined to solve the puzzle. In the search for Arnab, Vidya stumbles on Milan Damji who is a lookalike of her husband and is a prime accused in the metro attack.All the clues to the case are being eliminated one by one. The Intelligence Bureau is involved and the hunt is on. Vidya is being helped by a local police officer Rana alias Satyaki (Parambrata Chattopadhyay). They are warned by the Intelligence Bureau to stay away but how long can they continue their search? Why was Arnab missing? What is his identity? Will he ever be found? These are, but a few questions that the story will answer you. Be ready to be taken on a roller-coaster ride.Analysis: The movie is a drama-thriller. This genre requires exquisite attention to detail and a very well written script. A small blunder can make or break your movie. Kahaani has it all. With a brilliant story (Sujoy Ghosh and Advaita Kala) and a screenplay that runs along at a pace that will make you glued to the screen, the director has paid attention to every possible detail to ensure nothing is left in a hush.Coming to performances by the cast, Parambrata Chattopadhyay as Rana is subtle and delivers a splendid performance. He is a well-known figure in Bengali cinema and his entry to Bollywood could not have been better. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, as the IB Deputy Director, is just picture perfect. It is tough to imagine that he is the same character who played the pickpocket in Munnabhai MBBS. In a role as a ruthless cop, he does ample justice to the role and delivers a power packed performance.Rest of the cast; Saswata Chatterjee as a hit man, Darshan Jariwala as the former IB agent, Indraneel Sengupta as the rouge agent Milan Damji and as Arnab Bagchi, and every other member of the cast have delivered wonderful performances and not one of them looked out of place.Finally coming to Vidya Balan, what do I say about her? With Five brilliant performances in a row, she is unstoppable. She manages to reinvent and elevate herself with every performance and in Kahaani she just does that all over again. If The Dirty Picture won her rave comments from even the harshest of critics, Kahaani has just pushed the barrier a few notches higher.She not only carries out the role with complete perfection, she looks every bit of the character that is written for her. She has conveniently steered way ahead of her competitors to stake the claim as the best actress in India. The review is stretching out too long or else I could have written an entire essay on how brilliant her performance was.The director Sujoy Gosh has just opened the gates to endless praise. He has handled the subject in a manner that would shut even the harshest of critics. The element of suspense is kept throughout the movie and not once does the script turn out predictable. Crisp dialogs, backed by wonderful performance just makes it all the more better.The camera work by Setu is apt; Screenplay by Sujoy Ghosh, Suresh Nair and Nikhil Vyas is just perfectly paced, Editing by Namrata Rao is crisp, and costumes by Sabyasachi Mukherjee (for Vidya Balan) and Suchismita Dasgupta just blend into the story perfectly. Music by Vishal Shekar is subtle and the rendition of Ekla Chalo Re by Amitabh Bachchan is just fantastic. In the end, the movie is a case of all the right things at the right place in the right hands.StudentLive's Verdict: I will just keep this short, Kahaani is a must watch. If Paan Singh Tomar started a different trend in Bollywood, Kahaani just takes it further. Don't even think of giving this one a miss. I will go with 4.5 out of 5 for Sujoy Gosh's Kahaani. It is a wonderful gift to cinema on Women's day and Holi.P.S: Pardon me for the slightly lengthy review, Kahaani deserves every bit of praise. Source: www.studentlive.in",

            "content": "Vidya Balan seems to be riding the crest these days. After pulling off three movies, Ishqiya, No One Killed Jessica and 'The Dirty Picture' almost as the sole lead, and winning a national award for her last entr\u00e9e, she has hit the sweet spot yet again with this week's release 'Kahaani', a suspense thriller set in Kolkata. Just as the trailers suggest, the story is about a heavily pregnant Bidya err Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) who arrives in Kolkata looking for her husband who had arrived there on work and gone missing. Given the predicament, there is enough scope for drama. But, more interestingly, there is an undercurrent of an espionage thriller. The pre-title sequence opens with a chemical attack in Kolkata Metro. Cut to two years later, Vidya arrives in town for her quest and approaches the city police. Rana, newbie cop (Parambrata Chatterjee) has a soft corner for her and accompanies her in her hunt. Vidya seems to hit a dead-end in her search as nobody seems to know her husband Arnab Bagchi. But as they dig deeper, they uncover darker secrets. Okay! The discussion about the film's story has to stop here. It's a suspense flick after all. So, knowing anything more can spoil your experience. In fact, one can describe 'Kahaani' as an interesting multi- layered package that is unwrapped slowly, one layer at a time. Although it can seem slightly lengthy at some point, carefully planned twists will keep you glued to the screen. Also, notice the attention to detail in every scene. Many have been raving about Vidya Balan's performance. Full marks to her! But, what holds 'Kahaani' together is writer-director Sujoy Ghosh's watertight screenplay. The film is much unlike the regular bollywood thrillers that rely on stylish European locations, slick stunts, fast cars and scantily-clad women. Truly commendable! Among other goodies is Parambrata Chatterjee's has acted well along with some powerful performances by Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Khan, Saswata Chatterjee as Bob Biswas with Indraneil Sengupta in a brief role. Vishal-Shekhar's music has nothing striking, but flows with the film. Camera-work and editing is also neat. Filmmakers exploring cities other than Mumbai is relatively a recent phenomenon. While Delhi-based flicks gave the audience respite from tiresome Mumbai-based stuff, Kolkata is an interesting choice. The director effectively portrays the city's warmth, comfortable in its own time-warp while also providing the perfect setting for a thriller. Set around the time of Durga Puja, the film showcases the city's culture too. My advice: don't Google or ask-a-friend to know what the suspense is. Go to your nearest screen and catch the movie. Trust me, it's totally worth it!",

            "content": "Kahaani is a 2012 Hindi Feature Film directed and co-written by Indian movie maker Sujoy Ghosh. By striking a delicate balance between the elements of Comedy and Tragedy\u2014the two masks that define the Drama genre \u2014Kahaani serves to be a quintessential Drama while simultaneously succeeding in walking the tightrope of Mystery and Suspense. Kahaani depicts the fascinating tale of a London-based IT Professional, Vidya Venkatesan-Bagchi (masterfully portrayed by Vidya Balan), in desperate pursuit of her spouse who has gone missing in the bewitching city of Calcutta (now Kolkata). In a heavily pregnant state, Vidya Bagchi arrives in Calcutta to pursue the search of her husband Arnab Bagchi\u2014a Firewall expert who has mysteriously disappeared in his native city of Calcutta. Right from the moment Vidya Bagchi sets foot in Calcutta, a miasma of doubt and denial seems to occlude her strenuous pursuit. The apparent sympathy of the local police seems to betray simultaneously a sense of helplessness and sneer that further aggravates the torment of her abject solitude. Incapacitated by her lack of wherewithal and the fatigue of pregnancy, Vidya desperately roams about the city of Calcutta where she is greeted by the ugly realities of an ancient underworld waiting to unleash its fury. Amidst the city's perpetual hullabaloo, Vidya's only hope lies with Inspector Satyoki 'Rana' Sinha (subtly portrayed by Parambrata Chatterjee)\u2014a local cop with a pleasing demeanor and innocent disposition. The natural affinity between Vidya and Rana soon develops into mutual bonding of trust, respect and affection as the two delve deep into the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Arnab Bagchi. Kahaani's ostensibly straightforward plot has its fair share of intricacies that keeps the viewer interested until the movie's jaw- dropping climax. With Kahaani, Vidya Balan adds yet another feather to her acting cap. Riding high on her tour de force in The Dirty Picture (2011), Balan packs yet another punch with a powerful portrayal of a bemused, pregnant woman in pursuit of her missing husband. Balan, in a bid to make up for her delayed entry into the Hindi Film Industry, seems to go from strength to strength making most of the purple patch that she has been enjoying since the success of Amitabh Bachchan starrer Paa, back in 2009. In a short career spanning just over six years, Balan has incredibly managed to conjure up a handful of larger than life portrayals: be it her chilling portrayal in Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007) or her earthy portrayal in Ishqiya (2010). What makes Vidya Balan unique is her great ability to get into the skin of the characters. In an industry stricken by glamor, Vidya dauntlessly seems to tread a path of her own that's richly paying its dividend. In the process, Balan has undoubtedly succeeded in getting her name registered in an elite club of performance-driven actresses who, over the years, have done Indian Cinema proud. In Kahaani, Sujoy Ghosh seems to have settled for a trade off between his creative aspirations and commercial compulsions. Kahaani's multi- layered plot presents a nice blend of Drama and Suspense with undercurrents of Noir. The presence of an extremely peculiar serial killer considerably spices up Kahaani's plot and adds immensely to its entertainment value. In contrast to depicting the classic caricature of a damsel in distress, Kahaani beautifully propagates the complex caricature of the beguiling city of Calcutta. Like any developed city of the world, Calcutta too seems overwhelmed by lies and liars, and ironically the only refuge seems to exist at the very epicenter of chaos. Satyajit Pande's topnotch cinematography adds great detail to the movie at different levels, and is well complemented by Vishal - Shekhar's background music. The word 'Kahaani' translates to 'A Story' in English, and Ghosh does full justice to its meaning by offering a masterclass in storytelling and managing a nice assemblage of Stage and Television actors who give memorable performances in Kahaani with special mention of Sasawata Chatterjee as Bob Biswas and Nawazuddin Siddiqui.as A. Khan. Ghosh and his dedicated team remarkably triumph in their daunting attempt to bring the enchanting city of Calcutta to life as Woody Allen had managed with the City of Love in Midnight in Paris last year. Overall, Kahaani is a wonderful cinematic experience that certainly goes beyond the realm of entertainment. However, despite the brilliant execution the movie faces occasional slip-ups owing to some forced incorporation of gimmicks and misdirection at certain points in the plot. From the Box Office point of view, the success of Kahaani is a great testament to the fact that a movie can flourish even in the absence of aggressive marketing and promotion as long as its high on quality and has an element of uniqueness about it. Kahaani also marks the beginning of a new era in Indian Cinema where filmmakers are intelligent enough to take into account the commercial considerations and practical limitations pertaining to movie-making, but not at the expense of creative liberty. 8/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",

            "content": "For the lovers of story.. no item songs, no style statements and no annoying humor, Bollywood welcomes you with this 'Kahaani'. The movie lives up to its name for more than you could have asked for.The story starts with a pregnant Vidya Balan as Mrs Vidya or Bida Bakshi who comes from London to Kolkata to search her missing husband. There he meets Parambrata who helps her with her case. Her husband, 'Arnab Bakshi' works at National Data Center( NDC). NDC, hotel where he stayed, his uncle, no one has heard of a name 'Arnab Bakshi' and Vidya continues to insist her point . The first clue takes them to Mrs Agnes who is the HR of NDC. She tells them of some 'Milan Damji' who looks like Arnab. A series of phone calls and next we know Agnes is dead. In comes Mr Khan, some police head from Delhi. He is trying to protect the identity of 'Milan Damji' and we get the hint of he being the bad guy. At intermission, you know you have a winner at hand and the plot keeps you intrigued .Then, as the story proceeds to clues one after another, all of them die in the hands of a contract killer 'Bob'. They finally come to know of Shridhar who is the chief of NDC, who kept visiting 'Milan' and before Khan comes to the rescue of Vidya & Rana from Shridhar, Vidya kills him. This is where we get the first twist in the tale.. Khan & Rana were using Vidya to find a terrorist named 'Milan Damji' who was responsible for train attacks in Kolkata. If you think this is it, then hold on till the story unfolds. Any more revelations beyond this point would not do justice to this kahaani.Bob as the contract killer is brilliant. Nawazzudin as Mr Khan is rock solid. Parambrata as Rana supports Vidya to the core and yet again Vidya Balan delivers a stellar performance proving why she is amongst the best actresses we have. Director & Story writer Sujoy Ghosh brings to us a rare 130 minutes 'kahaani' that relives the genre of thriller movies in Bollywood.This one's for the win. Do not miss it.",

            "content": "A young woman, large with child, her jaw set resolutely, heads out of the airport and into the bedlam that is present-day Calcutta. As droves of taxi drivers close in on her, clamoring for her custom, Usha Uthup, Calcutta's most famous singer, snarls Aami Shotti Bolchi \u2013I tell you the truth\u2014on the soundtrack. The artful dissonance of that jazzy track highlights the paradox of Calcutta, India's most populous city, at once erudite and ill-bred. The mayhem is heightened as the city prepares for the ten-day festival of Durga Puja, Calcutta's biggest celebration. The young woman, Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan), directs the cabbie to a police station, where she files a missing persons report. She has flown in from London on the trail of her husband Arnab who had come to Calcutta on a two-week consulting job and inexplicably vanished. They are both computer engineers\u2014firewall specialists, a detail lost on the obtuse official taking down her report.Where would one even begin to look for a missing person in a city of teeming millions? One immediately sympathizes with the woman and the apparent impossibility of the task she has set herself. But we underestimate her mettle: she isn't cowed by bullying men who would have her accept her husband has left her pregnant and flown the coop; or by the Byzantine bureaucracy that accompanies the simplest government transactions; or the impenetrability of a city whose geography, language, culture, and nuances are completely alien to her.With intelligence, charm, and sheer doggedness, she works at unraveling the mystery of what might have befallen her husband. She gains unexpected allies in a young policeman Rana (well-regarded Bengali actor Parambrata Chattopadhyay in his Hindi debut), a couple of urchins who work as chai-wallahs and errand runners, and Agnes D'Mello, the kindly HR Manager of the company which might have enlisted her husband's services. Within days, she convinces everyone that she isn't budging from the city without answers.Her tenacity uncovers unsettling facts while yielding no satisfying answer about Arnab's whereabouts. As a contract killer starts shadowing her, we realize she is unwittingly on to something much bigger than the temporary disappearance of her husband. Sujoy Ghosh made his directing debut in 2003 with the sweetly gentle \"Jhankar Beats\", followed it up with two duds, and emerges a masterful storyteller with \"Kahaani\". The writing is the star here (Ghosh collaborated on the story, screenplay, and dialogue) \u2013there isn't a single throwaway scene in the film. In this ingeniously constructed thriller, even the smallest details have significance, adding up to a hugely satisfying whole.Vidya Balan, who is incapable of doing wrong these days, is the soul of the film. Her Vidya Bagchi is an unlikely protagonist for a mystery. Who would have thought a hugely pregnant woman scouring a city for her missing husband would make a compelling heroine? Going against the most primal female urge to find a safe haven to give birth, she instead thrusts herself into increasingly dangerous situations in her quest for the truth. She inspires compassion and admiration, as in the sweltering heat and chaos of Calcutta, she tours its morgues, hospitals, police stations, and seedy guest houses for elusive clues. Indeed, Calcutta is a character in the film: alternately stately, raucous, playful, boorish, scary, and secretive\u2014maddeningly tantalizing and stubbornly unwilling to reveal what happened to Arnab, and Ghosh and his cinematographer Satyajit \"Setu\" Pande use the city's myriad faces to telling effect. There is nothing showy or actorly in Vidya's performance: she creates a completely realistic character who\u2014even in advanced pregnancy\u2014will not be placated or intimidated away from her mission. Her forthright, no-nonsense manner is reserved for the world outside, but we witness her moments of anxiety, fear, doubt, and sorrow in the privacy of her hotel room.The film's conclusion falls fittingly on the final day of Durga Puja, the festival that celebrates the slaying of the demon Mahishasur at the hands of the fearsome goddess Durga. When everyone else is either ineffectual or untrustworthy, must Vidya Bagchi assume the modern-day avatar of an avenging goddess, too? It would be a disservice to the best thriller since \"A Wednesday\" to reveal any details \u2013 in fact, I entreat you not to discuss \"Kahaani\" with anyone who hasn't seen the film.Everything in this film works because it is so superbly and tightly written. The supporting performances are excellent, with Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the cynical Intelligence Bureau officer Khan, Parambrata Chattopadhyay, and Saswata Chatterjee deserving special mention. In flashbacks narrated by Vidya, we see Indraneil Sengupta as her husband Arnab, while Darshan Jariwala makes a dignified appearance as Khan's superior who took early retirement.

            "content": "If you are looking for a typical sort of Bollywood film where you have a romance and LOTS of singing, then \"Kahaani\" is not for you. While I like the former sort of film, here in the States MOST Indian films we get are like that and so it's nice to have something very different--and \"Kahaani\" is very different.Vidya Balan plays a woman named Vidya. She's lived in London and although she speaks Hindi, she is very westernized. So, when her husband, Arnab, disappears, she is not like a typical Indian woman--she goes looking for him--even if it means leaving her London home when she is obviously VERY pregnant (heck, she looks like she's ready to explode during the film!). However, when she arrives in Kolkata, she finds no evidence that Arnab ever went there on a business trip. The police assist her but they also come up with nothing. However, the woman in human resources where Arnab claimed to be working thinks that perhaps Arnab is a DIFFERENT employee--a guy name Milan that worked there two years ago. Unfortunately for the H.R. woman, this ends up costing her her life! Obviously something very bad and very dangerous is afoot. To discover exactly what and who's behind it, watch \"Kahaani\". I could tell you more--as the film really packs a lot into only two hours--but it also would impact your enjoyment and give away way too much. Just see the film.There really isn't much to complain about in this film. The writing is VERY original but more importantly, it's very INTELLIGENTLY written and is made for an audience who doesn't mind a complex plot or strong female lead--especially for an Indian film. I also LOVED the balding assassin--he was so scary because he seemed so incredibly ordinary! All in all, a great film--one of the best I've seen from India and comparable to the best stuff made anywhere.",

Among all senseless movies, such movies reinstate faith in Hindi cinema. Excellent effort by the director in both scrip and casting.The movie starts with a terrorist trying out a gas attack on rats and when thats successful he tries it out with humans on the metro. Then the story shifts to a couple of years later. Here a heavily pregnant Vidya arrives in kolkata to search for her missing husband. All she has left with her is only a photograph of him. She directly goes to the police station from the airport and here she meets rana who instantly develops a liking for her. She lodges a complaint and the inspector of the station is also impressed as she fixes the new software in the station computers.Now with the help of rana she begins the search for her husband with the minimal number of clues she has got. As she proceeds in her search she learns that her husband resembles a former employee in a certain company ndc. When these developments take place she unknowingly shakes up an old case with the Intelligence bureau and the second in command A.Khan enters. He is no nonsense cop whose mission is not clear in the beginning. At the same time, few people feel the heat that that triggers few killings by the normal and not so harmful looking contract killer bob. The first half finishes with the last scene being bob trying to kill vidya.A.Khan then reveals to vidya that the former employee with whom her husbands face recemble is the dreaded terrorist who killed 100 people in the kolkata metro. and he also reveals that the terrorist was a former government agent who turned into a terrorist there is a mole in the ndc and ib who are directly helping the terrorist get away. The rest of the story revolves around how Vidya connects all the dots and help the police. And does she find her husband forms the rest of the story.The movie has a lot of nail biting scenes. The bgm is a main ingredient as it adds to the suspense immensely. The director should be praised for preparing such a tight script. And as far as the casting, he has just got the right people for the right role.The movie has been released just after Vidya Balan got the national award and this movie might get her another one. The woman almost singlehandedly has carries out this movie on her shoulders. She is just almost ruling the male dominated industry with her moves like nokj, dirty picture and the latest one kahaani.",

            "content": "I think this movie compares quite favorably with another Hindi crime thriller I watched recently, that being 2015's \"Drishyam\". The reason I liked this one just a bit better has to do with the plotting, which was meticulously done, and the length at two hours made it quicker paced, thus more thrilling to get to the conclusion. There's also the idea that the criminal in this story didn't get away with it, whereas the ambiguous nature of the accidental homicide in \"Drishyam\" leaves one somewhat conflicted about the story's resolution.I would probably have given this movie a full 'ten' rating had it not been for a weak scene involving the assassin Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee) tracking Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) through the streets of Kolkata. The way he was interrupted by the overweight bystander resulting in the innocent man's shooting was kind of lame. Bob had already been established as a cold, competent killer, so how he would have made an unforced error like that didn't seem credible. And then, when police inspector Rana (Parambrata Chatterjee) began chasing Bob, why wouldn't Bob have simply turned around and shot him? He had ample opportunity during that confusing chase to kill Rana and avoid identification if he had been successful. So that to me, brought the picture's credibility down a notch.But for all the rest, I thought this was a well thought out crime drama with some cleverly written characters. I watched it twice actually, in order to identify the man on the tram at the beginning of the story who wound up staring at the broken baby bottle with the lethal poison gas that killed so many victims. Without doing so, it might be difficult to understand what Vidya's motivation might have been to take on the assignment given her by retired Colonel Bajpai (Darshan Jariwala). I find it amusing reading other reviewers who continue to describe Vidya as a pregnant woman searching for her missing husband after watching the film, it's even used as the tag line for the movie here on IMDb. If you pay attention to the story, you'll know that none of that is true because the events portrayed in the story make those conditions a moot point. Which might explain how the movie gets away with showing a pregnant Vidya with her husband Arnab a couple of weeks before she arrives in Kolkata. At the time, we are no more the wiser until the story's twist comes into play at the finale.",

The actors are perfect, the story is perfect, the direction is perfect, everything is perfect, and at the end you will find it hard to recover your breath, as you have to revise the great tangle and try to sort it out, which will not be easy.

            "review_title": "It's a tale with a sting in the tail",
            "content": "This movie has, in addition to entertaining me for two hours, reminded me of two things. Firstly, my Kolkata days. I had stepped on the Howrah Junction for the first time in my life on 31.08.1988 and left it finally on 15.04.1992 when my objective of obtaining my C.A. degree from the City of Joy had been met. I lived in Chittaranjan Avenue, a central place of the city for more than three and a half years and I still miss those days of walking 5-6 kilometres daily and travelling in buses, local trains, trams and sometimes the metro rail (it was in its initial period those days and used to run between some selected places only). I enjoyed watching movies in poor quality to high quality theatres, eating Jhaal Muri at roadside joints, drinking hot mil and having sweets at the roadside sweet shops, having my lunches and dinners at Maarwaari Baasas (Dhaabas) in the Bangur Building situated on the Mahatma Gandhi Road in the Burra Baazaar (or Bada Baazaar) area. Kahaani enabled me to relive that more than two decades old period. Everything in this world is prone to changes but by watching Kahaani, I felt as if very little has changed in Kolkata (except the name because then it was Calcutta). With the main protagonist of this movie - Vidya Baalan, I wandered through the streets, roads, localities, buildings and houses of Kolkata, the Kolkata of Bidya Didi (and not Mamta Didi).The second thing that this movie reminded me is the Hindi novels penned by Ved Prakash Sharma during the eighties. Ved Prakash Sharma, a Hindi mystery-writer from Meerut has been termed as the bestselling Hindi pulp-fiction writer of the eighties and the nineties. Mr. Sharma did not write pure whodunits. He used to write stories with a social tinge but containing a suspense element which passed current or shock waves through the minds of the readers at places and always contained a sting in the tail, rendering a big jolt to the reader in the climax. The script-writer of Kahaani (if it's an original idea) has done exactly that. It's a tale with a sting in the tail, leaving the spectator in shock and awe.Cinema is the fine art of telling a story on the silver screen in an interesting manner. A few decades back, the grandmas and grannies of small children used to tell them stories at night and helped them in getting asleep. However the storyteller in cinema has to do exactly the reverse. If the spectator remains engrossed as well as attentive to the story being told throughout the duration of the movie, the narrator can consider himself as successful in his mission. And Sujoy Ghosh has passed this litmus test of being called a good storyteller with distinction in Kahaani. It entertains, arouses and enhances curiosity with the advancing of the storyline, impresses with a high degree of realism, cuts all the crap and focuses on the main track only and ensures that everything told or shown has a link or relevance in the movie with nothing superfluous. The only thing that defies logic (in my opinion) is the incident of the contract-killer's not thrusting Vidya on the metro rail track and drawing her back instantly. When the contract-killer (and the person hiring him) had to ultimately get rid of her, then there was no reason to pass only a threatening and leaving her alive.I am not revealing the story here and I am very much annoyed to see that a couple of reviewers have revealed the suspense through spoilers in their reviews of this movie, thus diluting the pleasure of the prospective goers of the movie. I feel, there is no need to reveal the story or the plot here and it's better that the story is revealed to the moviegoers on layer-by-layer basis on the screen itself. It's a suspense-thriller but it contains healthy and natural comedy as well as the human aspect of life also. In certain ways, I feel like being able to compare this movie with the classic suspense-thriller directed by Vijay Anand, starring Dev Anand, Vyjayantimala and Ashok Kumar - Jewel Thief (1967). However the latter was a typical Bollywood potboiler studded with songs and dances whereas Kahaani is a modern movie sans songs and dances, pump and show. With Kahaani, our suspense-thriller cinema comes out of age.Kahaani is a near perfect movie with everything falling into place. The real look of Kolkata comes before the audience in the most authentic and influential manner. Not only Vidya Baalan but all other performers (mostly Bengali actors) have done their parts excellently. In Vishal Shekhar's music - Tagore's song Ekla Chalo Re and Aami Shotti Bolchhi are damn impressive. There are no other songs and the flow and the momentum of the story is nowhere broken. The background score is also perfect. Editing is razor-sharp. The director has not made a fool of the audience in the name of mystery. He has provided clues at places for the audience to think and figure out what the suspense is all about. However, the movie is fast paced and does not leave much scope for the viewer to take a pause and think. This edge-of-the-seat thriller is a team effort. And what an outstanding result this team effort has delivered !",

            "content": "KAHAANI is one of those rare well made movies (in this genre by Bollywood), which thankfully has something fresh to offer, moving away from the usual rom-com stuff coming week after week for our disposal. In fact movies like these keep the Bollywood flag high in front of the World Audience, otherwise we are too much occupied with the Hero-Worship here, followed blindly.But at the same time, KAHAANI is also not a Classic or Masterpiece if considered in totality, while moving out of the theater. It at once reminded me of a similar plot in \"A Mighty Heart\" (2007), which also had a pregnant Angelina Jolie coming in an unknown city (Pakistan) in search of her missing husband Daniel & also the climax of \"Taking Lives\". In short, KAHAANI has surely got its visible merits and does have some big flaws too which restrict it from being called a Classic. Nevertheless let us start with the winning points earned by the film which make it a worth watching experience for the Indian audience dying for something NEW.KAHAANI works big time in its first hour due to a gripping screenplay which drags you into the world of \"Vidya Bagchi\" the moment she gets off at the airport to hire a taxi. Though, she is very strangely at ease with a completely new town, language and people in just a few hours, which looks weird. Still the narration never allows you to think that way ever due to its brilliant writing and fine editing. Each and every character introduced within the first 20 minutes of the film impresses you a lot and one just feels like investigating the case along with them on the crowded roads of Kolkata.Where its first half excels in its execution, the second dips a little leaving the viewer asking for few thrilling surprises to be thrown in fast. But the director decides to give all those shocks towards the end only and this very move is bound to get some mixed responses from the viewers as it seems. Coming back to the exceptional qualities of the film, it's a Vidya Balan show all the way and the girl has hit the bull's eye yet again with her flawless, award winning performance as Vidya Bagchi. She right away wins your sympathy from the first scene itself and then makes you feel all the pain and discomfort felt from her belly, every time she stumbles on the roads of Kolkata. Further, KAHAANI continues to spell its magic due to its outstanding supporting cast lead by Parambrata Chattopadhyay as Rana and Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Khan. In fact these two are the other strong contenders of Best Supporting Actor Award along with Vidya going for the highest, fourth time in a row next year in all the Award functions. Besides there is a terrifying portrayal of a serial killer too in the film by Saswata Chatterjee as Bob Biswas, who re-defines terror in his own way making a stunning impact on the viewer. And last but not the least are the two child actors handled well by the director providing the much required relief moments in its tense script.Another eye catching achievement of the film is the way it captures the spirit of Kolkota in its peak festival time, from a local resident's viewpoint. Especially in the chase sequences shot in the narrow lanes of the city. However it also (for the first time) made me look upon the city as a scary one which I never felt before in another movie as such. May be it was the subject and the manner it is shown to us but Kolkata never appeared to be so tense and mysterious ever before in a film as I can remember.Musically it has a well composed background score which goes perfectly with the theme of the film as required without being loud. The title track is fine but I really couldn't enjoy \"Eklo Cholo Re\" sung by Amitabh Bachchan in the film's context after it was all over. So as I see it, this insertion was just either out of sheer respect for Tagore and Amitabh or it was solely used for getting some instant publicity for the film.Hence KAHAANI basically succeeds hugely in the way director, Sujoy Ghosh opens up all his cards slowly in an intelligent progression. It works mainly because of its superb way of story-telling and a tight script which at one end keeps you involved with a human touch (due to Vidya's pregnancy) and on the other, never lets you ponder over its loose ends or flaws with its slick editing.In fact, the biggest point which goes in favour of the film is that it allows the viewer to think about all the loopholes in its script only after its all over on the screen. In other words, till you are not told the truth, it looks like a perfect mystery thriller with many superlative performances and a fabulous script. But once the secret is out, you start picking many unanswered questions and impossible things in its narration as you start thinking about it again from the start. Frankly speaking, I was not able to appreciate its culmination at all as I was really expecting something much bigger and shocking from the writers. In clear words, its climax was too filmy for me which actually reduced the overall impact of the movie as it ended. Summing up, KAHAANI is unarguably one of the best films of the year capable of winning more awards for its worth praising performances. But with a different, out of the box conclusion it could have been a masterpiece in the Crime-Thriller genre which is a rare treat in Bollywood. Yet it deserves to be watched as a must for its gripping narration, execution and the wonder lady, Vidya Balan.",

The ace cinematographer has portrayed the rich heritage and culture of Kolkata during the Durga puja festival with aplomb. The streets and lanes of Kolkata (including my area where this film was shot) has been nicely captured. Performances by the star cast is like an icing on the cake. Vidya Balan is just amazing. She is so natural while playing the character of Vidya Venkatesan bagchi. Not just that she is superb in her dialogues, she emotes expressively through her eyes. Bengali actor Paramabrata Chatterjee does justice as his supporting role along with brilliant acting done Nawazuddin Siddiqui.

Vidya Balan has an innate ability to carry a movie with her flair for the simple and natural reacting more than acting. She does justice to the part of the \"that Pregnant woman\" like she always does to any part given to her as in \"The Dirty Picture and \"Who Killed Jessica.\" She along with Ghosh, should garner few awards, unless, the banchod suvvar scums from Scumistan, with their goonda cousins, who sit as Judges in all award shows, give them to this ape, a direct decendent of King Kong. along with his ape brothers,the midget monkey and the ugly scam artist. The direction is ace with sparse and discrete use of flashbacks. The intermingling of the street life, the culture, the festivities, is akin to watching a movie by Madhur Bhandarkar. The life and tribulations of living in Kolkotta is portrayed vividly by Ghosh, whose first film was a little known movie called \"Jhankar Beats.\" The story is unbelievable and should get an award for best story for the sheer intricacy. From what I have read the story is real with few twists to fit a movie and this is not a copy of a movie. Thank God we have Sujoy Ghosh and Dhulia, to save the Hindi film industry from these sewer rats from Dirty Desh and Filthystan that have hijacked the industry and are a national disgrace and they have brought shame to an illustrious industry.",

Everyone appears to know stuff but no one wants to reveal anything. Assisted by a young cop out of his good will, she sets on a mission to find her missing husband and bring the culprits to book.Storyline is too good, very different from a typical bolly film. They have depicted dirty and congested Kolkata very naturally and realistically, film has no choreography or item songs, which makes it very realistic, and is fast paced with a nail biting climax.Watch it.

            "content": "Right from the Howrah Bridge, bathed in chrome colors to the Durga Pooja, all in reds and whites, to the angst of people living inside the city. Kolkata would never have felt so much alive on the screen before. A character in itself, containing an assortment of people holding things close to their hearts and each having a story to be told. Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan), a pregnant woman, enters the mad rush of city with a hope of finding her husband in the lost crowd. A crowd having Kolkata living inside them. Easily muddled by the layers of complexity and the ingenuity of the characters, she learns the brutal fact that searching for her husband would be an uphill task. The director, Sujoy Ghosh, knew his content well and has masterfully executed a thrilling tale which makes sure that the viewer remains engrossed till the end credits roll down. Accolades to Vidya Balan for driving a film with so much of twists and turns safely home. She was terrific in her role and had a commanding screen presence. When all will be said and done, people will remember this as yet another movie, single handedly carried by an outstanding actress.This was a movie that belonged to the characters who found comfort in their respective places inside the screen. Special mention is to be made of Bob Biswas, who gave a trendiest performance with the role he was entrusted with. Parambrata Chatterjee as Rana shined brilliantly in his portrayal of a police officer who was helping our veteran lead. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Khan will be remembered for his cold characterization of an Intelligence Bureau Officer. Be it Setu's aesthetic cinematography, the soulful 'Ekla Chalo' rendition by Mr. Amitabh Bacchan, the jaw dropping intermission sequence, the devoted Durga Pooja crowd, the dramatic and heart racing climax, the scintillating opening scene or the claustrophobic environment of Kolkata, Kahaani hits each and every note right. A benchmark for the Indian thrillers, Kahaani will easily rewrite the way tales are told in our country. A path breaking movie that will find accolades among the classes as well as the aam junta. All said, this 'Kahaani' will leave you stunned.",

            "content": "'Kahaani' made me sigh twice once I'd finished the DVD a friend brought me home. The first sigh was due to the lamentable fact that it will never be screened here in Germany, even though we have a solid Bollywood fan base (as testified by 'Don 2'); the reason being that it is NOT Bollywood, but a solid thriller, and thereby defies our expectations of an Indian film (or so the distributors must think). The second sigh was out of envy for those who may read this review (or others), feel prompted to chase for this film, and then watch it for the first time. Because it was really an experience of brilliant film making not to be forgotten so easily.So what makes this such a great film? The story - woman arrives in Kolkata in search for her missing husband - is pretty standard and evokes memories of at least a dozen Hollywood films. But the use of a pregnant heroine is, at least for me, an absolute first. The premise, up until the final dramatic punchline, is built so skillfully around the main protagonist, that the effect is enormous. I know this sounds cryptic, but as usual with thrillers, the less you know about the story beforehand, the better.What's more is that we get a real screen gold couple here, the likes of which I haven't seen in a Hollywood film for more than ten years; Vidya Balan - who has always been the most memorable aspect of every film I've seen her in - possesses a quality that Hollywood actresses these days simply don't have anymore (unless they're over 50): edge. She can invest her character with such a variety of sensations, that the slight incoherence of the plot was completely lost to me. And Parambrata Chatterjee has a quality that Hollywood actors these days don't have anymore: compassion. The ambivalence of his performance is a key factor to the success of 'Kahaani', because it allows the (male) spectator to identify with him, see the woman through his yes and therefore go through the same surprises and reckonings as his character. The best acting I've seen in 2012 so far.Hitchcock would have nodded approvingly. Remains the question: with over 10,000 ratings, why isn't this in the top 250?",

            "content": "A pregnant woman comes looking for her missing husband only to be told that no one has any memory of the man she describes. An infatuated policeman decides to chaperon her on her one-woman quest. The challenge with this kind of overt genre film-making is that you are taking on Hollywood at their own game, and setting yourself up for a stiff comparison. Kahaani is clearly going after a Usual Suspects, Prisoners, Taken kind of vibe. Where it stands up is a well-constructed plot, that sets up well and delivers at the end, though unfortunately leans too heavily on a rush of exposition from a key character in the climax. It also does a good job of establishing chemistry between the two leads, the quiet but relentless Rana (Parambrata Chatterjee), and the stunningly beautiful and charismatic Vidya Venkatesan-Bagchi (Vidya Balan). Where the film is less convincing is in a flabby second act, and a decision to go after rapid cuts that lack any sense of rhythm or aesthetic purpose. Technically, also, the film falls down in that there are digital motion glitches at times. Also, the decision to shoot on the streets of Kolkata is admirable, but unfortunately means a horde of people staring at camera in every wide shot, which rather punctures the suspension of disbelief. It has some nice comic moments and a rather cool assassin, and while the script garners plaudits, it does not really hold up to intense scrutiny - you'll fairly quickly realise soon after the film ends that the whole premise makes no sense. Enjoyable, but flawed, and not something Hollywood will be losing any sleep over.",

She is in almost every scene, and she is simply wonderful! There are few movies from any country that feature a strong woman character, but this is one of those movies, and one of the best. The supporting characters are also just right, especially Rana, and it was refreshing to see a lot of the movie shot on the streets of Calcutta (sorry, habit) instead of in a studio or back lot. Although the movie is long (as always...) it kept our interest throughout and was very suspenseful. Well done! I hope it wins many awards and leads to more movies like it!",

The Rest of the cast specially Sasawata Chatterjee does an excellent and spooky job as Bob Biswas, along with a good supporting role by Parambrata Chatterjee as Rana,The Police Officer. The Rest of The Cast also do there jobs quite well.The Direction by Sujoy Ghosh is also excellent as he shows Kolkata superbly in this movie and more importantly does an even better job in making the movie what it is and has made one of the best movies of bollywood in this year. He Also has written the screenplay for this movie which is great and gripping with its turn of twists, and has written one of the better stories which he has utilized brilliantly through his direction.The Cinematography is also quite good as the cinematographer does a convincing job in showing the beautiful city of Kolkata excellently.

            "content": "The day its poster first appeared in newspaper I disliked it. A pregnant woman in backdrop of goddess Durga...resembles a heavy film on values, ethics, emotions etc... first impression.....not my kinda movie.Then I saw the trailer. I liked the idea. There are movies on similar idea so wanted to know how this movie is treated but the real reason of watching this was 'Kolkata'; I'm a Bengali and I just had to see how the director (Sujoy Ghosh) captured and presented Kolkata to global audience. I just had to know because for a long time Bengal and Bengali were type-casted in 'Dhoti', 'Specs' and 'oil soaked hair'. And who likes getting type-casted?!Story/Concept/Theme: So Bidya Bagchi arrives to Kolkata from London to search her husband who seems to be missing. She visits local police station, his uncle's home, his school and all possible places. But Arnab (Vidya's husband) appears to be vanished into thin air. None knows about him, none has ever seen him! Rest is to be seen. A very promising theme, at times reminded me of Hitchcock's \"North by Northwest\".Character development: There are total four characters who are given considerable time that you could recall their faces when they reappear. But, its only Vidya Balan's character which goes through various turmoil and transformations and her character is only one where \"Character development\" phrase can be applied. Next comes Parambrata Chatterjee as the police inspector (Rana). I would like to confess, I liked his acting better than Vidya's (don't judge me...not being biased here) Then a brilliant performance by Nawazuddin Siddiqui as IB officer. His character is well developed. And, Kharaj Mukherjee as Parambrata's senior officer gives few comic relief and lite moments for the movie.Direction: Sujoy Ghosh kept the movie as it should be i.e. an end to end thriller. He did not fall for giving it some patriotic angle, some insane back-story. Kept things simple and eye to details. And choosing the backdrop of the story as Kolkata. If it were not Kolkata I don't know where you could get lost so easily; the chaos, the places add extra point to story. A dusty almirah in a hotel seems possible here. The movie length is also of 2hrs only. Apart from a few unnecessary scenes (few seconds at max) the direction seems perfect. Looking forward his other projects.Screenplay: The screenplay is confusing enough to keep you busy remembering all the names of the characters you see in the movie. If you lost focus once you might just end up searching for answers. Dialogs are precise but void of swearing! This is not how bengalee speak, specially when men in uniform are talking among themselves! We curse but I could not hear a bit of faint cuss word in background. The pace of the story is also crisp only after interval its a bit slow. And you would only notice if you want to point out some fault in the movie.Acting: Vidya Balan is great as usual. But I don't think she's the man of the movie. Its a too easy role for her. Only challenge might be acting as a pregnant woman when you are not. I can't give the movie's full credit to her. No, I can't. I would rather say Parambrata did a very good job as 'Rana' the friendly police officer. Certain subtle gestures, his body language were superb. A simpleton newly joined police inspector full of values and slowly discovering how the system works. And obvious next mention is Nawazuddin Siddiqui as IB officer. His body language only shows how a person in position can abuse his power. He's so thin people could just slap him once he would fall flat but he uses his post to overpower people. Thus, may be he's portrayed as so aggressive.Cinematography: Absolutely brilliant! It had to be kolkata and that too this way only. Dirty, organized, friendly, rugged, fast and slow all at a same time. The movie was not about to promote Kolkata tourism so no extra shots on its beauty or prized possessions. To bring the essence of a vibrant and live city Sujoy had to capture kolkata this way. Songs and background score: Starting song by Usha Uthup is good apart from that we get another one sung by Amitabh Bachhan which I found misplaced and unnecessary. Rest are alright.Editing: Impressive job with editing. Very few unnecessary scenes that too would get noticed if you were looking for faults.Few words: The moment the movie started I was blown away. Slow but steady things stared falling into places (or out of place). You start to get pieces of the puzzle one by one. At times my intelligent friends here could have guessed the end but when the end comes near I can assure you all would be confused (This is how Agatha Christie did in all his novels). The end is a bit clich\u00e9d though 8)Verdict: A brilliant thriller after a long time (only comparable is 'Baishe Srabon' a Bengali movie) and a must watch for sure. 2 hours of your life well spent. Go for it.",

It's not perfect by any means, but the sheer presence of Vidya Balan, and some beautiful performances by the rest of the cast makes you forget all its flaws. Vidya is, am running out of adjectives here, stunning, and Parambrata Chatterjee is brilliant. After delivering a couple of duds, director Sujoy Ghosh comes up with a winner with the help of his co-writers Ritesh Shah, Sutapa Sikdar and Advaita Kala. As mentioned in the film, a pregnant woman searching for her lost husband against all odds makes you feel for her, and you can't help but take part in her quest. Sujoy was able to maintain the tempo perfectly, creating beautiful moments, not once giving away the suspense to make you a part of that quest. Exciting screenplay, excellent cinematography in the bustling by-lanes of Kolkata, and a decent background score keep you, maybe not at the edge of you seat, but close enough.Kahaani was not so well promoted, and doesn't have good openings to boast off. It's got no dancing numbers nor any sleazy skin shows. But it's got Vidya, and Vidya brings all the entertainment we need.

A look at the trailer would give you the feeling of that odd heart-touching story which shows a pregnant lady's struggles in a metro. I can promise you that this movie is much more than that and the exceptional cinematography aided with an intelligent screenplay gives us a winner. The casting for the movie is spot on. Vidya Balan who is riding high on her Dirty Picture success hits the mark once again. She portrays the pregnant Vidya Bagchi who is running around the streets of Kolkata in search of her missing husband with amazing zeal. She brings in a sense of exigency as her character develops and never loses control of the situations around her. She laughs, she cries, she chases mysteries and basically she does everything in the movie portraying a wide range of emotions superbly. She's already won a National Award and may very well be in contention for another. The rest of the cast supports the protagonist well and Parambrata Chattopadhyay( Rana), who may be viewed as the male lead, as a gentle but sharp cop leaves an impression despite a powerhouse performance by Vidya. Saswata Chatterjee as the playful murderer Bob is an interesting character and justifies his role. Sidiqqui plays the ruthless top cop( Agent Khan) and is a refreshing change from the affectionate Bengali characters of the city. Bachan's rendition of Tagore's iconic \"Ekla Cholo\" is elating and the rest of the score by Vishal-Shekhar duo is quite appropriate. The camera moves perfectly and captures the city and its characters well. As a movie set in realistic locations of Kolkata, Ghosh exploits the rustic warmth and Bengali charm of his City of Joy to its full. The chaos of Durga Puja, blistering streets, the rawness of the tea vendors and the metro scene stays with the viewers. Ghosh's masterful storytelling takes this melodrama to a completely different level altogether. The film is not without loopholes like the one where the protagonist of the movie is threatened for life and almost killed in the metro but is totally unruffled and the story seems unaffected by that scene. Also, the last few minutes which justify the conclusion seemed a bit bland. All the characters in the movie miraculously present themselves at just the right place for the story to move and that looked quite unconvincing in an otherwise realistic piece of art. But the flaws get overshadowed by the flow of the movie and full credit to the director Sujoy Ghosh for giving us an enthralling and absorbing thriller. Also, kudos to the team for bringing the eastern capital Kolkata back to limelight.Lastly, I would advise don't inquire about the movie any more as it may spoil the fun. Just go and listen to this exquisite Kahaani and you would come out saying that they still do make good movies in India. Deservedly 9/10.",

View on the film:Staying on the trail of \"wiped from existence\" missing person Film Noirs, (such as The Third Man and Bunny Lake Is Missing) co-writer/ (along with Suresh Nair,Ritesh Shah and Nikhil Vyas) director Sujoy Ghosh uses the wonderful,dusty,neon lit at night streets of Kolkata to give his amateur sleuths an environment that constantly keeps them on their toes,as Rana and Vidya go from investigating a run down,suspiciously empty flat,to beginning to notice that some government agency's seem very keen on Vidya herself \"disapereing\" on the streets of Kolkata.Despite the character having the risk of being rather one dimensional and staying constantly frantic,Vidya Balan gives a great performance which impressively emphasises sides of Vidya Bagchi which could easily have been completely over looked,from Bagchi's gradually warming relationship to Rana, (played with the right mix of a light comedic touch and smarts by Parambrata Chatterjee)to the thrill Bagchi gets when using her computer hacking skills.Disapointingly,after having smartly spent the first 90 minutes creating a strong mood of the movie building towards a gradually revealing twist as Rana and Bagchi begin to enter murky waters in their investigation,the screenwriter's stop the build up dead in its track,by unleashing a \"twist\" ending,which whilst surprising,feels as if it is from a completely different movie!,due to their not having been even the slightest build up to the twist,which abruptly changes the movie from being an enticing \"missing person\" Film Noir,to becoming an under-cooked Spy Thriller.",

No over the top emotional scenes just a terrific flow to the movie.Another mention for Sujoy Ghosh, he has displayed Kolkata life so brilliantly that you actually feel part of the movie, some of the shots and camera angles are inspirational.I highly recommend this movie, and rest assured if you are a true movie lover you will love this one.",

It seems easy enough until you find out she's faking it all and is hunting the man she's been talking about. I actually enjoyed it more the second time through. You start to realize she doesn't have morning sickness, doesn't visit a doctor, but she does get her way every time. I absolutely love when a movie gets me with a crazy good plot twist I can see coming, it's strangely satisfying to not be the one getting fooled. Vidya Balan is an absolute champ, she sells a vulnerable girl standing up for herself perfectly. There's subtle moments where you're shown characters saying more with their actions than with words. The pacing is good, it's set up well, and ends with such a good twist. It's a Kahaani you won't forget",

I want to say here that to find an answer for this question just go and watch KAHAANI.The movie starts with an interesting node and ends with a more interesting node. The movie leaves no stones unturned to surprise the audience every single moment. First of all Kahaani is very very well scripted movie. Kahaani is intelligently planned, executed and delivered. Shot in a crowded areas of Kokata in the event of Maa durga puja. This is where the director's job steps in....... I must admit, What an effort from the director....!!! The director has dared to step in to the right shoes of direction. Every single scene in the movie is very dramatically shot. Throughout the movie, he is been able to create moments one after another which will keep you on the edge of your seats. The characters are developed so well that every character will leave a lasting impression with you when you come out of the theater. Specially a small boy called BISHNU with a radio in his hand all the time is too lovable to say.Now coming to the important part of my review, the performance by VIDYA BALAN. She is just mind-blowing actor and her performance is unforgettable. Give her the awards already. I have to say this after watching KAHAANI \"Post Dilip Kumar, there was Amitabh Bacchan and then came Shah Rukh Khan. But here on there will be only Vidya Balan who will rule the Bollywood for Sure\". Go on lady....you are doing a fantastic job. Final verdict: Do not miss this movie at any cost. A must watch cinema. I bet you will start clapping in a shock at the end and come out with a smiling face. 2 big thumbs up for KAHAANI.",

The first things that stand out are the photographic visuals of Calcutta. Ghosh certainly captures the city's essence and presents it beautifully without polishing. Moreover the editing of the scenes, the way they're cut and sewn together is quite remarkable. The lighting, cinematography and sound design contribute very well. The other highlight is, without a doubt, Vidya Balan, who single-handedly carries the film. While Calcutta looks stunning, Balan is the reason to watch 'Kahaani'. Parambrata Chatterjee also lends fine support.The element of suspense is well maintained until the last quarter of the film. The twist in the end is a major disappointment. In a way it takes a full 180 degree turn and is just too far of a stretch to be convincing. Moreover the few sequences that follow are heavily melodramatic. Amitabh Bachchan has lent his voice for a song to remind us what a terrible singer he is.Yet, flawed it might be but that doesn't take away from its visual richness and Vidya Balan's wonderful performance.",

Do you take pride in being a Bengali and love Calcutta like no one can.. Well your wishes are answered. Watch it out in- KAHAANI. The very first question that comes to mind, when one hears the title: Whose story is it? And as likely as the Protagonist Vidya Bagchi would have answered \"Kya Farak parta hain\" (What difference does it make?) Yes truly: It doesn't make a difference. The Storytelling, the script, the editing, the cinematography, the superb cast and the directing craftsmanship: everything fall in place like the correct pieces of puzzle, all excelling in their respective areas. The Plot in a nutshell: A severely pregnant lady named Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) comes down from London to Calcutta in search of her missing husband Arnab Bagchi who had come for a 2 month long assignment in NDC. It is however mysterious that no one has any clue of a person by the name \"Arnab Bagchi\" having stayed anywhere in Calcutta or having worked in NDC. The Summary: It is at this very point that Vidya Balan needs a special mention. Well, Yes! in a way it is her STORY. It is her journey through her relentless search for her husband and her determination to find out the TRUTH (albeit ALONE) when everybody else gives up on her!!! EKLA CHOLO RE..song, at this point does such a fine justice to her MISSION. It is the most auspicious occasion of Durga Puja in the city when Vidya arrives and such craftily the theme of Goddess Ma Durga and the reason of her homecoming is interwoven with Vidya's plot here. Vidya Bagchi is supported in her search by junior inspector Rana aka Satyoki Sinha whom she admiringly calls \"Arjun ka Sarathi\" The amazing part of the journey is that all of Vidya's dialogues and her actions keeps giving us clues and hints throughout that we are only able to zero in at the CLIMAX. But I would like to REST my Case here at this point without giving out too much of the movie plot or what happens or HOW / If Vidya Bagchi succeeds in her mission or Not? That, should be left for the audience to see and judge! All I can say from my part- that there are two Things are that are exquisite in this Tale- Calcutta and Vidya Balan.. and amazingly: in this Story THEY both gel so well. Being a Calcuttan myself (as i happen to be born in the city) I saw a different Calcutta through the lens man's glasses! Wow!! never before my CITY felt so charming, so unseen, so vibrant - the frames are awfully beautiful and only ADDS flavor to the Story telling. BOB BISWAS- It would be highly unwise and unjust if i fail to mention one BOB BISWAS in this tale. A helpless, hapless forlorn LIC agent who can never meet his targets has in him a quiet-talker cold Alter Ego..the friendly neighborhood hired assassin who is as one too able in fulfilling his MMS targets!!! The fictional character has already become Legendary with his trivial one Liner: Nomoshkar, Ek minute! and BOOOOOOM! The Job of BOB is done :D Saswata Chatterjee as BOB BISWAS has done an amazing job and this fictional character is sure to become a prominent household name like a Gabbar Singh! The Verdict: I would give it 8/10 .. 7 can undoubtedly go to Vidya Balan for showing amazing variety in her artistry.. not to mention the National Award she bagged for portraying the life of Silk Smitha in \"The Dirty Picture\" Acting in all these and triumphing with amazing ease only goes on to show what 'stuff' she is made up of! Kudos: The Director was right maybe while he commented that he could think of \" no other\" for the role. To all Bengalis: If you want to see Calcutta in a frame like never before, AND before Next time: You let an LIC Agent enter your house... Watch KAHAANI. Missing it is highly detrimental to your personal entertainment! Oh yes!!",

All the other characters are relatively new or 'never heard before'. Yet, the script and direction carry the movie well into limelight and delivers a powerful message. There are cinematic liberties taken, but sensibly done.Vidya Balan does a really commendable job. So does each of the characters portraying a very different and interesting role. That each of the characters involved play a significant role and add meaning to the whole movie is something I liked very much. That includes all those behind the scenes too, especially the cameramen, editors, and of course the director, Sujoy Ghosh.Though there is some distant 'hollywood connection' (perhaps the finale resembles Taking Lives), the freshness of the plot too is very appealing ('cos these days there is hardly any creative script or thought).

First they wrote a story, then they said given this Kahani, let us write a Kahani around this Kahani and then another Kahani around the Kahani around Kahani. They decided to call the movie also 'Kahaani'. What struck most was the love of Calcutta that the film maker has. Looks like he has done an independent shoot of the city's charms and has edited and mixed these later into the scenes as fillers. This aspect is very striking and has a lasting impact. The final story line is interesting too but I know that the excitement that the movie offered is going to soon become pointless. I am much less excited about the movie now than 2 hours back when I walked out of the theatre. Calcutta and the plot was very good. The film fails at integrating the emotions into the movie. Here and there, pieces of emotions like seeds in an orange that you are better off spitting out.For current times mainstream cinema, it is an excellent movie though. Film also fails in it's characterizations to a big extent where people portrayed as kingpins do the dumbest things. It is definitely worth a one time theatre watch. You don't lose your money for sure. Yes, some things might not work very well with you but lots of things will. The 'EkLa Chalo Re' rendering by Shri Amitabh Bachchan is a great ending to the movie and reinforces the film maker's passion for Calcutta.That is the strongest thread in the movie and I have been to Calcutta just once and in my schooldays.",

The Movie is Inspired from Swedish DRAGON TATTOO Series released in 2005 (book) 2009 (movie) \"The Girl with Dragon Tattoo (character development), The Girl who Played with Fire (the real case) and The Girl who stirred the Hornet Nest (the final stand)\" which also follow the similar plot-line.!!! I am using the word similar as the movie was banned in India for it's violent content and nudity. Thus the Indianized version comes out a little different. Like the \"kaagaz ke phool\" was Americanized into Oscar winning \"The Artist\" !!!There are quite a number of things which makes the film better than the original: 1. Lesser or I should say no violence. 2. The Lead Character is not a borderline Psychopath. 3. Summarizes the \"Stieg Larsson\" Books in just 1 hour 55 Minute. 4. Bring back the Movie Location back to city of joy Kolkata. 5. At last the Law Keeping Forces are shown doing what they really should do. 6. Great Story which proves that if you have a good actor backing it, movie will certainly be Hit. 7. India got it's own \"LISBETH SALANDER\" 8. Well executed \"9 Inch Nail Scene\" which supersedes the same scene in The girl who stirred Hornet Nest. 9. With the \"Dragon Tattoo\" Series banned in India; we still get the story on the Screen. Cheers.************************************************Similar Characters: Vidya = Lisbeth (Lead Cast) Rana = Mikael and his Millennium Team (Investigation Helper) Khan = Armansky and Edklinth (National Intelligence Support) Vajpayee = Palmgren (Caretaker) Monica = Monica (Rana/Mikael Mole in the Rouge Spy Group) Arnab/Milan = Zala & Nidermann (Product of Rouge Organization) Bhaskaran & Briefcase Man= Sapo's \"Section\" Group (Architect of Rouge Organization) Assassin Bob = Svavelsj\u00f6 Gang (Paid Hit-man)*********************************************** Vidya Balan excel in yet another role (she seems to be better than any Khan at the moment). Both Vidya and Lisbeth shares their \"Never Say Die Attitude\", Determination, Resolve. Both being world class Hacker who are very good in concealing their identities.

While the movie has critically been acclaimed by everyone on the planet, I do have my reservation on the story which I found difficult to comprehend at the end.Lets talk about the story. Milan Damji is a some scientist or IB Agent (or may be both) who has gone rogue. In last two years, IB had done investigations, but they couldn't locate the employee records from old office or the place where Damji stayed. Can that happen? Lets assume IB investigation was led by idiots. Now lets see the motive behind Vidya to go for a revenge of this scale after two years. Is Vidya some trained professional? It seemed so the way she handles herself at the end while killing Damji. But wait, isn't she a software engineer? In the beginning, the Metro train incident - that seemed like to have happened by an error and wasn't intentional. In any case, Damji never planned that to kill Vidya's husband. In that case, is there even a case of revenge?As per story, Arnab and Milan worked together. Wouldn't Milan know Arnab's wife? When Milan has already gone rogue and IB ran investigation, found nothing, then why so much of a concern with a lady like Vidya coming into picture. Not like she is more dangerous or powerful than IB. In any case, I never understood any logic in killing Agnes or Dr Ganguly. There was nothing useful information that they could have given here to catch Milan. Also I didn't understand why Khan would stop Vidya in not looking for her husband. How does it really matter to him? He is to find Milan, isn't it? Stopping Vidya is not going to help anyway.I guess I can go on and on about my questions. But they are not important. This movie is sweet right from beginning to the end. Depiction of Kolkata is amazing and Bob Biswas's acting for me clearly stands out amidst all. Rana looked too sweet to be a police officer, but perfectly fine. I would have liked him using his police instincts and power in the movie, which I think he rarely did. Khan did what he was supposed to - however his depiction could've been handled better as well. Background score is awesome and never in the movie you feel that things have been overdone. Scale of this movie looked good. The shaky camera work (like hand-held shots) does remind you of Bourne Series. Its effectively and nicely used. There is lot of 'Kolkata' in the movie and I felt that director lost the plot somewhere in excitement of depicting Kolkata. Director could have taken 20 more min and shown a better integration of all. There was no need to hurriedly close the movie in 2 hrs. Overall 7 rating from my side just for Kolkata, and a fresh plot / movie.",

And I can safely say my hopes for Bollywood cinema have finally been rekindled.The film, from the outset, establishes itself as significantly different from any other Bollywood movie around. Different in a very good way. What I loved about it was the lack of unnecessary songs which only take the focus away from the main plot. Of course there was a lot more to love.Vidya Balan for starters. A friend of mine mentioned to me that she is the only Indian actress who delivers hits while portraying characters realistically. She was, for the most part of Kahaani, a pregnant lady with minimal makeup and wearing nothing but (don't get ideas) an ordinary saree. Something quite rare nowadays in Bollyworld, eh? Unlike many in the industry, her status in Bollywood as an actress is justified.The background score was another great plus. I would describe it as understated but consistent. At no point did it seem to steal the show, and suited the mood of the scenes very well. The supporting cast delivered excellent performances too. Kahaani has honestly rekindled my hopes of Bollywood contributing something to the world of cinema sometime in the near future. Watch this! 10/10",

            "content": "Bollywood is actually very much popular for its Thriller Movies. Bollywood isn't exactly popular for good thrillers. Very few of those who claim to be of this genre actually manage to shock and surprise you with their storyline. Without doubt, Kahaani belongs to this elite group. From the moment of its amazing opening sequence you realize that this one is going to be an enjoyable roller coaster ride.Sujoy Ghosh, who last awed us with his Jhankaar Beats, indeed brings to us 'the mother of a story' in Kahaani. Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan), heavily pregnant but determined, arrives in Kolkata in search of her missing husband. But was seems to be a simple missing person's case turns out to be more twisted and complicated than expected. It's Kolkata so yes, anything can happen. With things not what they seem to be and people not what they appear like, Vidya has to fight a lone battle and against time to find her husband.Any thriller, no let me correct, any movie is made or marred by its opening and its climax and Kahaani has both brilliantly written and shot. What makes this such a winner is the fact that it' is good both in story as well as execution. Sujoy and Advaita Kala's storyline and Suresh Nair and Nikhil Vyas's screenplay make Kahaani an engaging affair. Sujoy brings to life not only the characters but also the streets and the alleys of Kolkata with utmost sincerity. It's not difficult to see the level of detailing to which he has paid attention. Whether it's the Durga Puja, the characters and their accents, the clothes, the hair, the make-up\u0085nothing looks out of place. With enough twists and suspense to keep you engrossed, Sujoy makes sure that you remain glued to the screen.If one is to talk of the performances, Kahaani is one of the few films in which each and every character \u2013 even if it's a two minute role \u2013 has been true to the role and delivered it well.Parambrata Chattopadhyay as Rana, a helpful police officer shines in his nice guy, silently enamored character and is a good find. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the rough-talking-tough guy proves once again after Paan Singh Tomar that he can carry off just about any character with ease. Dhritiman Chatterjee, Saswata Chatterjee, Indraneil Sengupta and Darshan Jariwala do justice to their roles as do the small characters like the guest house owner, the two kids, the HR head\u0085never do the actors ham and haw. But of course, the star of the movie and the one who single handedly carries the film on her shoulder is the super talented Vidya Balan. Mind you, it's Mrs. Bagchi you see on the screen, never Balan. Looking convincing as a pregnant woman, Balan emotes a range of performances from anger to happiness, fear to determination \u2013 Vidya shows that she can do it all. Never once do you see her uncomfortable or out of character whether it's the scene where she silently breaks down, or her frustration on not being able to drape a saree properly or the climax. I could go on and on but for someone who gave us great performances last year in No One Killed Jessica and The Dirty Picture we know that she has truly arrived.And let's not forget one of the biggest and important characters in this movie \u2013 Kolkata. This city plays an integral part in the unfolding and the continuation of the story. Setu's breathtaking cinematography brings to life this mysterious city with its old world charm where, as Usha Uthap rightly sings while introducing this city,'Dil ka bazaar hai, thoda bizarre hai, Kolkata khwaishon armanon ka aachar hai' .We have seen Mumbai and Delhi been a part of many films but never before has the City of Joy been portrayed the way it has in Kahaani; the small quaint streets, the people (for whom Bidya and Vidya are the same), the Howrah bridge and of course the Durga Puja \u2013 Kolkata is served to you as a delicious dish.Vishal-Shekhar's music complements the mood of the movie and it is good to see that the songs don't mar the flow of the story. The only point against this movie is perhaps the editing. Kahaani, in actuality, isn't a very long film (about two hours). But somewhere in the middle you tend to get a feeling that the movie has turned a bit slow. A little bit of snip-snip and a little bit of more pacing would have worked wonders.Nevertheless, Kahaani is an amazing product AND a great entertainer. Watch it for Sujoy who delivers his best till date. Watch it for aamhar Kolkata which looks dangerous and sexy. Watch it for Vidya, who like music director Shekhar said, is the new hero.",

She starts her search of her husband by lodging a complaint at the Kalighat police station and then starts her own personal journey in which she gets across various elements who just tell her that they do not know her husband and do not even have any trace of him.

To know these answers, just rush to a theater playing \"Kahaani.\" More of this review at www.cinemaya-bazaar.com",

            "content": "You can hardly find this kind of brilliance in a Bollywood movie. Its much more then expected. Its going to be one of the greatest movie of all time.Talking about the story, you will find it quite ordinary if you have just read it or heard it. But actually its a kind of story that has lots of twists and turns.A story that won't let you leave your seat even in the interval. It gets more and more interesting with time. The movie has acting performance that will hold you spellbound. There are not many big names in star cast but each knows how to act well. Especially the characters of Bob Biswas (Sasawata Chatterjee) and A.Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) were brilliantly performed. Vidya Balan also gives full justice to her role.The cinematography is fantastic. There are many good shots showing the culture of the city-Kolkata. Movie's music is different from the most of the main stream Bollywood movies, but it is perfectly matched with the pace of the movie. Its like cherry on the cake.Its good to have suspense in the movie. But the important factor is that the revealing of suspense should be at proper time. Thats the point where most films lags behind. I have seen many beautiful plots wasted at the end in Bollywood as well as in Hollywood. But Kahaani earns extra marks here. That's what i liked most about the movie: proper timing. This makes the movie a masterpiece.Final verdict: 9.5/10. A must watch movie.",

            "content": "Hindi films have had many thrillers, most of which revolve around similar plot of gangster action, and off late hardly such films have accounted to classics. Kahaani, from trailers and posters, seemed to be an offbeat commercial cinema: a lady (pregnant) in search of her missing husband in a city where she finds herself lost in a labyrinth. Like that in That Girl In Yellow Boots? No. Good that it's not. We are offered with some chilling suspense and thrills. Move on.Vidya (Bidda) Bagchi arrives Kolkata from London in search of a man called Ornob Bagchi whom she claims as her husband. Fails to learn anything substantial about him, she is supported by a policeman Rana (Parambrata Chatterjee). Look into Vidya's character, she seems stubborn, a fighter but somewhere you expect her as a typical Indian woman with melodrama to burst out as she grows. And she proves you wrong every time! She is a computer programmer, fixes bugs of police database system and boils up when sees a old rugged hard-copy records at the guest house. This is a subtle way of her characterization that she is way beyond intelligent than we expect! As soon as the story moves ahead, with its pace set to engage you and the characters infuse into the plot, you are given with many dots to connect. Solve the riddle. Say that you predicted the entire story. The movie still has things unrevealed to fool you. I bet. It's a smart & witty tale if you ignore some doubtful flaws and get carried away.And what makes this tale happening is the top notch direction by Sujoy Ghosh. Bringing a pool of characters into the play, using them and eliminating them eventually, keeping the pace composed and delivering thrills and shocks with moments justifies the script and contends the audience at the same time. Ghosh pays ode to his hometown - Kolkata, where the plot is based, emanates its colors time to time. Also, not to forget, his respect for R.D. Burman (remember Jhankaar Beats?) with his songs in the background. Background score with mainly Aamhi Shotti Bolchi in the opening credits and Ekla Chalo Re in the closing, rest are not much derived from the album. Tore Bina rhythms at the scene where Vidya is seen waiting at the door for his husband, is delightful.Coming upon performances, characters portrayed by Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Khan, Bob Biswas played by Saswata Chatterjee and Rana will stay with you even after you move out of the auditorium. And by now we are habitual to see Vidya Balan outperforming in each of her movies since years. So lets just awards speak the rest! All and all, Kahaani is a mind bender, thoughtful film that gives you from balls in mouth moments to gulp in throat! After the cult Jhankaar Beats, and many flops later, Ghosh is back in action!",

She is charming in the way she talks with the kids and playful in the bus-ride with officer Rana.Then the subtlety with which Rana emotes the love he feels for Vidya and the hesitation while picking locks to find out evidences.The brash hard talk act by officer Khan and then the evil menacing act by Bob Biswaas.Brilliant!!",

I bet you have never experienced a better 132 minutes ride in your life before.Should it be compared with a Sherlock or an Agatha, well I am not sure about that but if those characters had been still alive they would have given a salutation to Sujoy & his wonderful team.

It considerably makes me feel less interested , while it dramatically raises some issues and unnecessary scenes which are so very unreasonable,in the other words, so boring!! Those scenes (I believe they are deleted scenes but are added back BECAUSE OF poor scriptwriter) are way too ponderous and make me feel sleepier and sleepier along with dull acting and conversation. I rate this movie 3 out of 10 because it contains good start and good ending. Only Start and Ending, indeed!!

The acting of Vidya Balan is as flawless as we have seen her in \"Dirty Picture\" and \"No One Killed Jessica\". This girl seems to know well what she is upto and accordingly mold herself with each characters she is assigned to. It would be unfair not to mention the name of Parambrata Chatterjee.

Vidya Balan(Vidya Bagchi) i thought was a very talented actor but now has turned phenomenal,she gives some stares in this film which says a lot about her development in the years starting from Hum Paanch,the TV serial. Parambrata and Kharaj excel in every frame. Parambrata(Inspector Satyaki/Rana) is very good with duologue's but is even better in quiet sequences. Kharaj is very to the face. Nawazuddin(Khan) plays the no-nonsense IB Deputy to the best of his ability,direct and aggressive. Now the character who blew me away is Bob Biswas,played by Saswata. I now cannot think of reasons as to why he has not done such roles,Just Brilliant. There are two characters Milan Damji and Arnab Bagchi,who create all the mystery and in the end the mystery is very well solved. Well done Abir and Indranil.The background Music is worth listening. Now,the city Kolkata in its full festive mood is shown against the backdrop of this thriller,I think the director should be given accolades for this simply because no one has done this before in Bollywood,and he has excelled in his motive. The duologue's are pretty good. The camera work is brilliant,specially with all the beauty of Kolkata shown on screen. Even actors playing small roles have done very well. The music is good and looks better on screen with the movie. All said i have given 10 because of not including any songs in this thriller as it would have ruined it. Finally,with all the actors signed it would have turned into a mess had they not been given enough space and this is where i felt the Director wins.Well done Sujoy Ghosh.Take a Bow. Hope this Kahaani a Success.",

Kolkata is a City which is famous for its Culture, Civilization and City of Joy. But Director shows us a dark side of this City. Where people can be so Double minded and mean.

A heartwarming performance by Vidya Balan( As per Bengali Bidya Balan)as she is undoubtedly best Indian Actress i have seen. All the Actors and subordinates are performed from their sole. Every frame in this movie is so exciting that you felt irritated when Interval comes. Songs which are narrated from great Rabindra Nath Tagore's \" Jaid tor Daak sune keu na ase\" is amazing.

            "content": "I always thought there are two kinds of actors- good and bad, until, I met the third kind- The intelligent kind- good actors with a knack of interesting scripts, Vidya Balan is one such actor. Fully aware of her 'body type' Vidya, very subtly encounters the 'damsel-song- and- dance- beauty queens' of Bollywood. First with The Dirty Picture and now with Kahaani, she brilliantly managed these roles on screen which most of her contemporaries wouldn't dare to due to certain awkwardness. With Kahaani she diligently replaces the memory of her last performance with a sparkling new one. Kahaani is a jigsaw puzzle which is brilliantly let out in a perfect setting, laden with interesting, intriguing details with fine clues. Barring the climax, this thriller does enough to keep you at the edge of your seat. The high point of the film is the interval. Like an engaging sitcom thriller this one too leaves you at the peak of your anxiety level right before the interval break. Kahaani is about a pregnant woman- Vidya Venkatesan Bagchi, who is in her third trimester enters the frantic pace of Kolkata in search of her husband- Arnab Bagchi. She is a London based software engineer- a Tamilian married to a Bengali who disappears within two weeks of his visit in the City of Joy. In her quest to find her husband she befriends many people only to complete her journey, walking alone- ekla cholo re. Discussing the plot further would ruin the film completely. At times the bare minimum information is all you need. Sujoy Ghosh direction is tight but the screenplay and script is bit confusing and in conflict. But having said that, Sujoy builds enough anticipation and tension without relying too much on the background score. Post Jhankaar Beat his love for R.D Burman was quite evident in this one. Along side Vishaal & Shekhar racy soundtrack Burman's classics like Tere Bina from Ghar, Lekar Hum from Yaadon ki Baarat as well as Bangla version of Jaanejaan (Jawani Diwani) adds so much more to Kahaani and Kolkata. Apart from the in-your-face stereotype Kolkata, Ghosh Kolkata is surprisingly brewing with friendly, sympathetic inhabitants like Satyoki aka Rana (Parambrata Chattopadhyay) whose earnestness and affection towards Bida was endearing. So were the kids who'll melt your heart with their smiles. On the extreme end you have Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee) who does enough to give you goose flesh. Ghosh gave Kolkata an eclectic mix in this film. On one hand you'll find stark areas, congested by lanes, the chaos, the breathlessness, a complete claustrophobic setting (almost like Aamir) on the other hand you'll witness Kolkata's beautiful architecture, soulful, enigmatic, unchanging festive setting. It's only fair to say Kolkata in Kahaani adds so much character to the film. Despite flaws Kahaani is a safe bet. The tale is rather too interesting and gripping to find flaws!

No spoon feeding was required and I would have been happy walking out with questions in mind than being fed the answers. The cinematography and acting were top notch. The dialogues were a bit clich\u00e9d yet impressive as they went with the mood of the scene. The pace of the movie is really appreciable and so is the lengths about 2 hours.If I would say what the movie is about, it would be OK, but if I would say what the movie shall reveal, I may well spoil the whole point. Being an ardent film lover, I would express this much, the journey is enjoyable and reveals many points of views but I felt like being deceived by the point of view of the narrator, who makes our protagonist, Vidya Bagchi into a demi goddess, alias Durga Maa. The film was shot in real locations and has very good feel in terms of locales, where in Kolkata can be felt and smelt at places, like the Trams, the buses, the chai wallah, etc.. But why Kolkata? was this chosen because it had a metro, or because of Durga Puja and the white and red sari tradition or just getting us cut off from the now overseen Mumbai or was it because director Sujoy Ghosh was from Kolkata. I would subscribe to the last reason though. Same story, set in any other city may have been dealt differently, cause the topography, the dialect, the outlook towards life of people will change. Kudos for director in setting up the whole screenplay and spreading across the length and breadth of Kolkata. The story is about a wife searching for her husband, and there are few very very evident flaws as I have seen. 2 years after an incident, how can a woman become pregnant or at least be seen as pregnant. If policeman can make out another policeman his agent, then what are we being driven to, a mockery of system that has honesty under the veil. OK, I give in to the logic, to everything for nearly two hours, why was such an explanation given so elaborately explaining incident by incident and how did the policeman Rana just on fly, conclude what he said about Vidya Bagchi in climax. Question still remain, but I would have been happier if the twist was subtle and simple rather than explicative. Happy for everything but the end. A movie that has to be watched only on the praise it accrued through, but don't feel bad if you are disappointed in the end. Expectation and tastes differ. It's 3/5 for me, a good movie till a point where the purpose of story is revealed. It was better being hidden. I would have been happier coming out with questions rather than being clarified about every tiny instance.",

            "content": "Half the battles in making Kahaani were won when Director Sujoy Ghosh chose to set his film in Kolkata. Wise move that Sir. The film starts paying a 'spicy' homage to the city where the author feels that the city's ambitions and desires are amalgamated into a pickle (Kolkata Armano aur Khwayishon ka Achaar hai). With a supremely confident Vidya Balan, Perfect Parambrata and a decent story, we have a winner in our hands and the character and the actor who played Bob Biswas is just an icing on a delicious cake.The film starts with a pregnant woman in search of her missing husband, not one of the most original beginnings, but the pace picks up instantly as soon as she lands in Kolkata. She heads directly to the Kalighat Police Station and en route we are treated to visual brilliance and vignettes of Kolkata. The scenes at the police station are the dysfunctional Indian Government Office stuff, cynically comical and laborious but importantly Vidya Bagchi befriends Rana and the two embark on a journey of intrigue. The film has enough twists and turns to keep the audience hooked through out and whenever the film hits a dull moment, the director sought rescue from Kolkata and the city never played a spoilsport. But, the major concern is that at crucial moments in the film, it asks for more suspension of disbelief than we think it would case in point being the locks being opened with a hairpin, twice that too. Now in regular Indian Cinema, we wont tch tch for that sort of thing but we tend to judge good films on harsher scales. Also, towards the end of the film everything fits in magically into the pieces, so there's no complaining even though we would like the film to play itself a bit more and sort the things clearly than in the hasty fashion that it was wrapped up.",

            "content": "Let me start this by bringing a fact, even a good script which could be delivered in a hollywoodish style should not compare CIA , FBI with that of Indian CID or IB. Our intelligence is not at par with international corruption or intelligence. Indian IB is shown hiring a female stranger to hack their own employee computer, that too when the computer is fitted with a technology which is capable of sending a Red-Flash SMS to the mobile number in a very graphic way. The hacker just need a random punching on the keyboard and bingo you got the 3 layers protected IP address within some 5 minutes. What else you can expect from a director who made Home delivery, Aladin and Jhankaar Beats. Sujoy Ghosh was brilliant in casting some good bengali actors along with Ms Balan and roped them in the streets and bylanes of Calcutta (Kolkatta). The sets were real and had conviction. It was real soothing to eyes that the streets and Police stations were real with real problems. The film opened in hasty and noisy Bengal. Sometimes you might wonder why the director is not stung by any Harry potter style sets (Remember Aladin). The story was tense enough to build an ambiance but kept failing towards the end and finally was slaughtered, and at this point when you look back to the story you might laugh. The story of fake husbands and pregnancy might have occurred to many and Nemesis of names was the game of the movie.You might wonder how can a lady just arrived from London with a revenge and a perfect plan for a plot everybody will fall. The voluptuous woman after 2 years of training still remains voluptuous. The murder attempt at Vidya and the fearful runaway was so fake that a woman with such a deadly intention would not fall for it. The story was unfolded little late and the surprise factor was spoilt before it was delivered. Sending the much needed man Damji to collect the evidence by the IB chief was too fictitious.I would still like to love this movie due to actors like Parambrata Chatterjee and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Chatterjee was a treat to eyes and a fresh face for Bollywood and he did his justice to the character of a fresh sub inspector. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as IB Maa ki Khan had some intense moment. His flawed moustache was unimportant when you look into the eyes and read his lips. Vidya balan was her usual better that the sultry Silk from Dirty picture. This movie was a blend of Kolkatta and Balan. The screenplay was right and with the good intent. The surprise factor was Saswata Chatterjeeas as Bob Biswas the LIC agent and the contract killer. The dumb look and the zeal for the kill after saying a loose namaste was amazing and a treat to eyes. The music was very bengali in nature and matched the infatuation of director for the love of the city. The song 'akela chalo' was good in the end but unnecessary at first place breaking the flow of the movie. shankar Ehashaan and Loy's effect went unnoticed. The movie was about a pregnant Vidya, Mysterious husband and Calcutta.The taut story could have more conviction.",

Movie stays true to its title : A well-written 'Kahaani'.Vidya Balan carries the movie on her shoulders (or in her womb?) without the need for any conventional hero. Supporting cast is brilliant, especially the ferocious IB officer Nawazuddin (Mr. Khan), bespectacled contract killer Bob Biswas, and Bidya's lovable saarthi - Parambrata Chatterjee(Inspector Rana). and above all this, the city of joy- Kolkata! The city is brilliantly captured by the camera from Howrah bridge at night to trams to Durga pooja. The film is completely soaked in the Bengali flavor. If you enjoy watching suspense thrillers, this is one of the best you can find in B'wood. Khub bhalo chhilo. Absolutely Recommended!",

She doesn't need Khans, Kumars.etc to run her films and when the Bwood is busy doing remakes and sequels, here is a star who believes in doing good script based films. The film is a thriller but not like most Hindi dumbed down thriller, this one keeps you hooked throughout and slowly we are moved into the worlds of Vidya Bagschi and her search for her husband. The plot has several interesting characters like the inspectors, Inspector Teri Ma Khan, Bob.etc and it keeps you involved There are some few errors here and there but there are whitewashed with the crisp handling of the script. The twist in the finale is superb however it may not be understood by all and it does leave behind some questions Direction by Sujoy Ghosh who gave terrible films like HOME DELIVERY, ALADIN is back with a bang and does a great job Music is decent, Amitabh's EkLA CHOLO is superb the rest songs are mostly used as backgroundVidya Balan gives a terrific performance, she portrays her character with the perfect angst, pathos and emotions The film casts several actors who got a huge exposure through this film Nawazuddin Siddiqui often seen in bit roles prior to this film does a superb job as Teri Ma Khan, Parambrata Chatterjee is superb Indraneil Sengupta last seen in DHOKHA is good in a small role Darshan Jariwala,Dhritiman Chatterjee are okay Saswata Chatterjee is superb as Bob and so are rest The obese cop and Agnes",

End segment.Vidya travels from London, UK to Kolkata, West Bengal, IN to find her husband. He talked to her everyday since he left London, up until about two weeks previous.At the first the police have no idea. The place where he worked claimed he worked says they made no assignments for him, and he did not report to them. The police suggest a body; she does not recognise it. She and the police go to where his uncle lived, but no one will say that they know of him. They get the same sort of response at the school where he did his studies in youth. The cops investigate the airline records; no one of his name left London nor arrived in Kolkata on the given dates.Vidya reached out to Agnes, who does some digging, but finds locked files. Oi. She remembers a man with another name (Milan Damji) who looked just like Vidya's picture of her husband. Soon thereafter, Agnes is murdered. A police official (Khan) who is targeting the company NDC interviews her about her relationship to Agnes. The experiments at the beginning of the film were done at NDC.Khan and his boss reach out to outlier intelligence personnel to solve the crime of the rail attack. The bad guys attempt to scare Vidya with a visit from the man who assassinated Agnes. Vidya and Rana continue to investigate her husband's real movements before he disappeared.Will Vidya find out the truth? Is her husband still alive? Will the miscreants be brought to justice? -----Scores------Cinematography: 6/10 Lots of VHS level shooting, lots of amateurish footage.Sound: 8/10 Mostly fine, but some of the incidental music is annoying to say the least.Acting: 7/10 Reasonable. The is mostly a one-woman show, but the one woman is not nearly stellar enough to carry a two hour movie. The long-suffering Parambrata Chatterjee gave a good performance, which almost counterbalanced the rotten work of Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Saswata Chatterjee as the assassin was not very believable either.Screenplay: 0/10 Absurd. The bad guys could have defused this at many junctures with relative ease. A single knife thrust, for instance, and no one would be left who cared enough to keep the investigation going. So, this is PC nonsense with an unconvincing lead. The last five minutes were the worst in that regard.",

There is little that the cops can do since they are unable to trace any records of her husband in the guest house, office or even airport immigration. Things take a drastic turn when Vidya learns that her husband had a lookalike and perhaps that could get him closer to her search. But soon her personal quest turns into a political conspiracy.Vidya Balan is the life of the film. She depicts the helpless yet brave pregnant woman very realistically. Parambrata Chattopadhyay, as Rana, is a discovery. He is superb as the young cop who falls in love with Vidya. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is memorable as Khan. Indraneil Sengupta does a fine job. Saswata Chatterjee (as the assailant, Bob Biswas) is just wonderful. Darshan Jariwala, Dhritiman Chatterjee and others offer able support.Sujoy Ghosh's direction is very good. He makes the narrative engaging from the start to the end and extracts fine performances from his cast. However, his narrative style will appeal more to the city-based class audience. Vishal-Shekhar's music is very good. Setu's cinematography makes the nooks and crannies of Kolkata come alive. Production design, by Kaushik Das and Subrata Barik, is realistic.On the whole, Kahaani is a very good entertainer which will pick up by word of mouth publicity.",

The writing and execution is taut giving a edgy thriller feel. \"Dhobi Ghat\" had Mumbai, \"Delhi Belly\" had Delhi - Kolkatta doesn't get left behind and gets showcased in \"Kahaani\" in full glory to the extent you would state that it is one of the rare movies where a city is used as a backdrop, alleviating the viewing experience. Vidya Balan is nearly on the verge of a home run and the success of \"Kahaani\" is yet another feather in her cap. Parambrata Chatterjee has written dark horse all over with his subtle and restraint delivery. Saswata Chatterjee leaves an impression as a insurance agent who doubles up as a hit-man (though his character is borrowed from a Sidney Sheldon's works). Nawazuddin Siddiqui creates an impact in a role of a no-nonsense officer. Darshan Jariwala barely has a few minutes in total. The climax attempts to answer the riddles in the style of \"The Usual Suspects\" meaning warranting a second time watch - and honestly \"Kahaani\" deserves.",

Kahaani is that sort of a thriller drama which fulfill all your expectations without dropping the momentum throughout. From the word go, Kahaani engages you into its drama and never let you go even after the credit starts falling down. As expected from Vidya Balan, she carries the movie over her shoulders and makes every scene convincing and entertaining. But she is not alone, the characters such as soft hearted inspector Rana and arrogant but purposeful inspector Khan provide their full supportin making movie an interesting and thrilling watch. Shot beautifully,the movie works as a tribute to the city of Kolkata. The names of the key characters like Vidya Bagchi, Arnav Bagchi and Milind Daamji will remain with you even after few days of watching the movie. Last but not the least, credit goes to writer-director Sujoy Ghosh (Jhankar Beats fame so far) for top-notch grip on the narrative. After watching Kahaani, it's hard to believe that same person gave us duds like Home Delivery and Aladin. This is a genuine thriller from bollywood after a long time.

Both the fictional character and the director are here to stay.Some plot holes may be pointed out but nothing is perfect though Kahaani is quite close to perfection.",

            "content": "I saw this movie recently with some backdrop buzz about the movie, Vidya Balan on her fourth female centric movie which had made great collection in the box office (Movie budget : 8 crores and Box office : 104 crores approx - source : Wikipedia). Overall this was a sensible, touching, suspense, thriller movie. The backbone of the movie was of course Vidya's character which is portrayed very well. She brought the character to life with her soulful acting along with her natural looks and vivid expressions, body language, voice which makes her look like someone amongst us. The daring part of the movie which you will find catching is the way it has been shot so lively hats off to the cameraman Setu for bringing it live on celluloid. It will reveal you Kolkata's beauty on its usual dailies and during Durga pooja festival.Yet another hit movie joining the Vidya female centric band wagon after 'The dirty picture', 'No one killed Jessica', 'Paa'. Great movie, Powerful story and overall an Excellent master piece by the Director Sujoy Ghosh. NB: I didn't talk anything about the story because I don't want to shatter the suspense. Must watch. -Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran",

Kahaani is a thriller which revolves around a pregnant woman who is in Kolkata to search for her missing husband. However, through some contrived storytelling, the true nature of the incident is told. Every scene in this movie is well-shot with breathtaking attention to detail. You can tell that the filmmakers have a put in a lot of effort in making this movie. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who is playing an IB officer, steals every scene in which he is present and he is truly one of the finest actors in Bollywood. Vidya Balan is thoroughly convincing throughout and gives us a reason to believe that movies with female leads can be successful as well. This is a movie which must be seen by the masses in order to appreciate the beauty of the storytelling, the twists and turns and the honest performances from all the actors. Do not miss it.",

The support cast is perfect.I don't want to reveal too much of the plot because of the suspense angle. The basic story is that a pregnant woman (Vidya) comes to India in search of her husband who disappeared suddenly while on a work visit. She goes through the complex Indian government system and meets some rude and some helpful people. The mystery gets thicker as she tries to uncover the truth.The twists are totally unexpected. Ending is brilliant. It is one of the finest suspense films that needs to be viewed a few times because every time I see it I find something new.",

Ekla Cholo Re by Amitabh and penned by our Great RABINDRANATH TAGORE was too good. Vidya was too convincing as pregnant lady because it never occurred to me until the climax scene. She is the MOST TALENTED ACTRESS OF THE ERA/TIME and she proved it by taking a step further as pregnant lady from the National award winning Dirty Girl in the movie Dirty Picture. I think female oriented or female protagonist movies had a bad time before but thats over with Vidya Balan on one side. The movie started with a good pace and kept on till the end. Even the scene where the people in the train die is shown without stereotyped loud shouts and all. I had from the start been thinking there is some connection between train event and Vidya Balan from start but this movie was too unpredictable. I thought Vidya's character Vidya Bagchi's Husband Arnab was cheating her but finally curtains were raised. This movie also brought in 2 talented actors Parambrata Chatterjee,Nawazuddin Siddiqui. I personally think Vidya is the most promising actress of our time and all others have to study from her. She is NEXT BIG THING of Indian Movies if provided right movies and opportunities.",

As an emotionally vulnerable , physically weak & pregnant Vidya Bagchi in search of her husband in an alien city , Vidya Balan excels in her role. Vidya Balan of \"Kahaani\" is far superior in performance than in \"Dirty Picture\" & one wonders whether one more National award beckons her. It is Sujoy Ghosh's first major work after the critically acclaimed \"Jhankar Beats\" & he has written a neat , taut & engrossing thriller , perfectly executed to create the intended effects on the viewers. The suspense & the twists all through the movie keep the viewer engrossed to the screen. Many scenes are excellently executed sending shivers down the spine , especially the one in the old NDC office & the intermission block. Casting is perfect to say the least . Lot been said of Vidya Balan. Parambrata Chatterjee does a charming job as the sympathetic policeman who helps the protagonist all through the search. But it is Nawazuddin Siddique who steals the show with his superlative performance as the foul mouthed deputy IB chief. He is first rate. Saswatha Chatterjee as the assassin camouflaging as an insurance agent is sinister & creepy. Sethu's cinematography is remarkable, especially the ease with which the camera travels the busy lanes of Kolkatta & the crowded Durga pooja processions. Vishal-Sekhar's background score adds up to the impact & spruce up the thrills. Though there are numerous logical holes in the script , neat & flawless execution of the same conceals the same. I didn't know that people in Kolkatta are so fluent in Hindi & each and every one speaks only in Hindi. On the whole, \"Kahaani\" is worth the every cent spent . Go for it , enjoy the excellent acting & flawless execution of edge of the seat thriller after a long time.Bottomline : Bindaas",

Of course reading this might put you off but I wont say its an obvious ending but just a cliched one. So its still definitely a wonderful movie until the end and keeps you hooked throughout.So now lets get with the positives, the way the screenplay works is masterclass and some extremely opportunistic cinematography using Kolkata immerses the audience to the world the protagonist thrives in.Vidya Balan plays a tamilian married to a bengali who has gone missing on his Indian visit from London. Both are software engineers/ethical hackers and implied that this commonality has brought them together. She is pregnant but comes to India in search of her husband. This is the premise and what follows is a showcase of excellent characterizations, drama and fine film making.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and is a shinning example of how female actors like Vidya balan, Alia bhatt,Kangana ranaut have helped save the bollywood industry.",

Backed by an award winning performance by Vidya, this film is certainly the hot contender for story of the year, and we're only 4 months into the year! It'll be difficult to top this.Vidya is first rate, and is the life and soul of the film. The way she carries off her role is too good, and too easy.

The picture is a \"complete Collage\" between the aspects of mystery.. culture... life flow and heritage of Kolkata. Somebody may say the film is brilliant that's true, absolutely true the story is so much engrossing that we will never put away our eye from the screen.The suspense provided within the film is unparalleled ,till the last minute of the film nobody will have a clue about the twist that will appear at the conclusion of the story.And Vidya Balan has done it again, two top notch film back to back has completely defined what a brilliant actor she is ,have to say a magnificent acting. And the role played by Saswata Chatterjee is also very very unusual and difficult to act so as to define himself in a role of serial killer.At the last i must say, being a Kolkata resident myself, it shows it all about Kolkata and its inner aspects which being bad rough and sometime irritating. it have its own place within our heart.The camera-work is just awesome it has uplifted the unique aspects of the city which make it different from any other one in this world.the last scene of the Maa Durga's face submerging in Ganga (Dashami of Durga Puja) has a profound effect with the ending of the story. And from my personal view. being away from my city of joy(Kolkata) has made me a bit nostalgic about it.Full credit goes to director Sujoy Ghosh. From me its 10/10 for this film. not a penny wasted. its a must see film for anyone who love suspense thriller & serial killing mystery. keep up the good work Bollywood!! this film has created a benchmark that needs to be touched.Thanks all of you for reading this review.",

The movie is basically a thriller . the movie was supported by some brilliant acting by Vidya Balan. she was backed up by many artists from Kolkata's local film industry but among them the most prominent was Saswata Chatterjee (as Bob Biswas, the serial killer). the movie was so well directed that it exceeds many Oscar winning Hollywood movies in its brilliance. the movies only used song was Rabindranathh Tagore's \"Akla Cholo Ree\" sung by none other than Amitav Bacchan.

            "content": "I come from India and I have missed out a lot of good Indian Cinema. Indian films are known for their style of using spicy music and actors acting in a hyper way. That's why I usually reside in foreign films and hate these kind of films (some of them are nice though, just a few ;)). But there are some really great Bollywood films that have come out in recent times that break all these common rules and have grossed more than these clich\u00e9d films. Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani is one of them. In the film, a pregnant women (Vidya) comes from UK to the city of Kolkata, India, in search of her missing husband. She hadn't heard from him for a long time and the most surprising thing is that everyone denies of seeing him. She visits all the places where her husband has been (as he told her on the phone). There was just no record of her husband, not even his flight records. Vidya, with a local inspector Satyaki Sinha (played brilliantly by Parambrata Chatterjee), go deep into the mystery in search of a her husband. As the film advances, the mystery deepens and leads to a final epic conclusion.I know what you are thinking... This story is just like Lady Vanishes, right? This is where you are wrong. Firstly the screenplay is ingenious, something that probably even challenges some of the greatest Hollywood films. The final result is realistic, truly something you don't get to see in Indian cinema. Secondly, the acting is miraculous. Vidya Balan, who plays the pregnant women, gave me an impression of a woman really being pregnant. It's not so easy to act a pregnant woman as you have to walk in a different fashion and Vidya Balan stays that way the entire film. Vidya Balan is such a versatile actress that she has made to Times Magazine's 100 most influential people. Her Femininity is one of the powerful elements of this film. The Inspector, played by Parambrata Chatterjee, is a new actor but he surprised me. The whole ensemble was great, they deserve a standing ovation for their performances. Thirdly, the beautiful direction. The film is richly detailed, something that even the greatest of Western cinema lacks. I can't go into these details but believe me I am not praising this film just because I am Indian. Lastly, the film's ending is quite thought-provoking. The film highlights terrorism and detests it. But I won't give you any more details, it might spoil the fun :D!In conclusion, Kahaani is rich in story-telling, acting, directing, details, screenplay. It's culturally rich too (something that most Indian films lack, probably all!). If you are an Indian, go watch this now. If you are from some different country, I assure you you won't be sorry... In my personal opinion Kahaani is by far the one of the best Commercial films that Bollywood has ever produced. And for it's creativity, courage and breaking common Bollywood rules, I bow down to the entire team of Kahaani. We really need films like Kahaani to develop a good taste of cinema in Indian audiences and the good news is because of Kahaani, no ones likes to watch those kind of clich\u00e9d Bollywood flicks anymore!...Visit my facebook movie page: www.facebook.com/filmsthemostbeautifulart",

After such a long time I had seen such a wonderful movie. Director Sujoy Ghosh redeemed himself ... in style (after Home Delivery and Alladin)! I can go and on with the merits of the film but do not wish to spoil it for you. I won't talk about the story but only about the performances.Except for Vidya Balan, the rest of the cast are not well known Hindi film actors. But they are well known Bengali film actors and that clearly shows in their work. Vidya Balan is flawless. But unlike The Dirty Picture and No One Killed Jessica (her last two near perfect performances), this time, the script and the film rise above the super talented actress. That shows what a powerful story and screenplay Kahaani has to offer. All the supporting actors are superb as well. Parambrata Chatterji as Vidya' confidant makes a confident Bollywood debut. He's obviously very talented. Whoever decided to cast Saswata Chatterji as Bob Biswas is a genius! Another amazing talent! Nawazuddin Shah is another show stealer. And by the time this review is up, he has already delivered kick ass performances in many more films. In fact they are all good!Sujoy Ghosh deserves most of the awards for this film. Kahaani is truly praiseworthy and deserves all the accolades it has received ... If you haven't watched it yet, do it before the world ends! :) Jokes apart, this Kahaani is truly one to remember for years! A well deserved 10/10!",

Some lovely moments and brilliant humor ( specially in those police station scenes) and a memorable small-part character in Bob Viswas are key Parts of Kahaani. But At the centre of it are fantastic performances Vidya Balan is terreffic surpassing her career best performance in Bhool Bhulaiyaa, and equally magnificent is Nawazudin Siddiqui, you cant move your head when he is on screen. This is a very smart film, and a well-structured film. Some brilliant thrilling moments and its highly-engaging climax will make you thrilled. Some great display of acting and smart direction. So in the End Kahaani is a must watch with memorable characters and strong screnplay. Highly recommended. Dont miss it.",

The plot is mesmerizing and sujoy manages to win our hearts by portraying Vidya balan as the affable Vidya bagchi. from being concerned to being a hacker to finally being revealed as an agent trained for two years, she has blended very well with the demands of the script. the focus was purposely on the helplessness of a pregnant women in dealing with the cops and tracing her husband. Nobody could imagine that she was using the cops to get to her man. Bottomline: Excellent script, terrific acting and mesmerizing cinematography. That the climax in the midst of the durga puja doshomi( the day where idols are immersed in the holy ganges) was a fitting end to the movie as it symbolized 'job done', just as Maa Durga leaves when she has killed the demon Asura. Rare movies, such as this, ought to be the cynosure of all movie goers. Doesn't matter if you are reluctant to buy a new pair of jeans, because you can use the ones you have for some more days, but do not be reluctant to catch this one, as you will find a new taste of bollywood, one that you haven't tatsed for years.",

            "content": "The plot was fine but the director missed some very important details. There was no serious mention of both the murders(Agnes & Dr. Ganguly) by the lead characters as to why the victims were targeted and no pity/regret for them (victims). Also how did Vidya Balan got trained to use such skills? It'd have been nice to see some training. The retired officer(Bajpayee) didn't quite fit the character, I mean he didn't look as if he could train and impart such skills. The producers and director should've casted someone like Manoj Bajpayee or for that sake anyone else. Another loophole according to me was the scene where Vidya & Rana go to the old office of NDC. They break the lock and minutes later Bob arrives, he enters the office. Doesn't he notice the broken lock and smells something fishy? Just before intermission we're shown the scene where Bob pushes Vidya in front of the railway. What was the sense in showing the scene twice, I couldn't understand, just to create curiosity in the viewer. Another major flaw- When Vidya Balan visits the police station in the later half, Mr. Chatterjee(fat policeman) welcomes her. And we hear the error sounds from the computer. The policeman is relieved to see her & asks her to fix the PC. Then he goes out for some work and returns in 3-4 minutes. By then, Vidya completes her task. And then she asks the permission of Mr. Chatterjee to leave. Now, in the whole scene, the policeman doesn't even bother to ask her as to why did she come there? And as Vidya's motive was to extract information from the computer, how did she know that at exactly same time will Mr. Chatterjee leave? And when the policeman returns, it doesn't even strike him as to why she's leaving so early? I mean, the viewer will be just left wondering about these questions. One relief was that there were no songs in the film and some light comedy was really done well. The Character Of Rana and Khan were played brilliantly by both the actors & Vidya Balan was as usual at her best. Also the cinematography of the movie was good. Essence Of Calcutta is very well captured in the movie. The psycho character played by Bob was also up to the mark. It'd be nice if the producers make a prequel to the movie. Then we can learn more about Bidya, her husband, Milan Damji, Bajpayee and many more characters in detail. Also, it would be nice to see some training in the institute.",

You will just fall in love with the colors and shades of the city and the magnification cultural diversity it portrays!Vidya is back with another award worthy performance, good to have a true actress in Bollywood getting roles worth her salt.Parambrata Chatterjee is quite convincing, a young, compassionate, good hearted cop who is not yet corrupted by webs of materialistic world.Nawazuddin Siddiqui delivers a powerful performance of a no nonsense intelligence agent. He is rough, coarse, ruthless, is not bothered with the trivialities of politeness and morality, always means business and gets his job done no matter what it takes.Director Sujoy Ghosh does a very good job of keeping audience at its toes. Not a single second is wasted in the tight power packed thriller.Script and background score are the real performers of this movie. No matter how convincing actors are, or how good the direction is, ultimately its the kahani (story) which keeps audience tied to the screen all the time! No wonder the title is Kahaani (hindi for the word 'story')!Narration by Amitabh Bacchan and his deep brooding baritone voice complements the tone of the movie perfectly. Over all a very good movie and definitely a must watch. I am planning to go for second time today.",

From fantastic characterization and perfect casting to simply a film embellished by class performances -- Vidya Balan - Oh yes! - (and I exclaimed not just because she is sexy!!) -- the impetus with which she illustrates the versatility in portraying personalities has made this film a thriller of higher class. The other high points are the metaphorical references emanating out of Durga Pooja festival of Kolkata. Nonetheless, Kolkata itself got a 'nice role'. After seen a lot of 'Bombay', it is much refreshing to see some colors of this amazing city. The film finely depicts the zeitgeist of the place -- the film is dipped in the culture which forms the canvas for it. A must see!",

Vidya Balan is absolutely outstanding as Vidya Bagchi, a woman who is determined to find where her husband is despite the odds against her. Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Parambrata Chatterjee are good in their supporting roles but at the end of the day this is Miss Balan's film. Her performance is the only thing you will be thinking of after you have finished watching this movie. She truly is one of the best actresses in recent years and I hope she gets a good role soon.

It seems that with her stupendous performance in Dirty Picture, she just needs to be in the lead to make people declare the film as \"outstanding\". But, in the final analysis the film fails to rise above the level of mediocrity. It's biggest drawback is the story. Having taken the Tokyo Serin Gas attack as the starting point, the narrative completely forgets to explain why the attack took place at first and what motivated the head of the Indian Intelligence to get involved in the conspiracy. The attacks in Japan were launched by a religious cult who believed that it was the duty of its members to bring the apocalypse on this world. The entire edifice of Kahaani is built on very weak foundations. Secondly, the film owes a lot to Malayalam film Director Blessy, whose Calcutta News was also shot in the city and Sujoy Ghose has used his imagery almost to the extent of having copied it. The end leaves a lot to be desired. It was too contrived with the inevitable Durga Pooja processions providing the backdrop. The film is put together well for which the editor deserves a lot of kudos. but on the whole, it has received a lot more praise than I think it deserves.",

And about watching this movie,Very excited to see a thriller after a gap. and that too set in one of my favorite city : KOLKATA. Vidya's character vidya lands up in kolkata to find her missing husband. That's the plot, the only plot. And that is perhaps the only negative thing about this. Felt there should have been sub plots. Could have given more space and role to \"KOLKATA\" . Apart from a few shots and fests of the city, there is not much about it. But apart from that, KAHAANI is really very good. A very engaging thriller well shot and performed by the crew and cast. Not making it dull with any unwanted songs or fight scenes, a common problem that most films of this type will have. It's also well edited and so not slow. After watching all the movie and you see the climax, u will be like WOW!!! AWESOME.. Soon after TDP, Vidya's another good role but not up to what she did before, but still the role has been very well written and executed by the director and Vidya respectively. @Sujoy Gosh : A very good work of yours but the narration could have been more interesting with twists towards the end. If we keep the climax aside, we won't get anything new out of this.The Kolkata sounds and the BG tunes jell very well. liked that also..",

Bollywood keeps giving us options after options with endless movie releases every month. Just when we begin to think, it is all too clich\u00e9d, staged, unbelievably dramatic; just when it all these releases fail to hold-interest; we get rare gems like Samay, Raaz, Shootout at Lokhandwala, Ishqiya, No one killed Jessica come along and make all these movies worth it. (I could 've spoken of Slumdog Millionaire here, but it has too much of Hollywood in production to be categorized as Indian; anyway\u0085)Kahaani, with its mystery-thriller story-line, sits right in line with these movies. A very powerful and fast story-line, as a pregnant lady sifts through streets of Kolkata in search of her husband to find her missing husband has not existed in Kolkata for anyone else, holds audience to the seats right until the end credits roll. Though it is a fictional story, what surprises me is absolute lack of Bollywood clich\u00e9s and Shakespearean confusions and misses.Direction and cinematography is quite commendable. The movie has captured the essence of city \u2013 the culture, durga-puja, dirty alleys and even the strained lifestyle. There are no ultra-clean streets with pretty models running about; no unbelievably dramatic situations; no interrupting songs (which almost always seem out of place). Speaking of the songs reminds me of the powerful Kahaani's score \u2013 a true example of setting and switching moods simply with a well-blended soundtrack. (I wondered how long it would take for Bollywood to understand this!) Vidya Balan is undoubtedly a talented actress; proved yet again as she portrays the pregnant Vidya Bagachi; the innocent, intelligent and committed wife. Sujoy would've have had very little to think about while identifying the actress for the lead role. Despite being a complete deviation from what Indian audiences most prefer, Kahaani with its plots and Indian flavor scores brownie points with all.

Well, to start with, there was so much of good cinema in the late 80's that went unnoticed. Few Reasons have been: Poor publicity, Change of taste> Romantic movies were more in demand! Remember> 'Maine Pyaar Kiya', Emergence of Khan bandwagon, etc. etc.During the same time, a movie called \"KHOJ\" was released. Starring Rishi Kapoor, Kimi Katkar, Naseeruddin Shah, Danny Denzongpa, and many other established actors. Produced and Directed By Ramsay Brothers (Yep, the ones famous for Horror flicks) Now, \"KAHAANI\" is more or less 'Inspired' By \"KHOJ\". So if you've seen KAHAANI, then here is KHOJ's story synopsis:-Ravi Kapoor (Rishi Kapoor) A Husband, whose wife is missing, has come all the way from abroad to find her... Naseeruddin Shah (Inspector Balbir) helps him in his mission. It's a Gender Change in KAHAANI... Wife is looking for her missing husband.Both have the similar climax, where... Don't worry I won't play a spoiler here! :) KHOJ was one of those well made films with great performances by all the leading stars. Well, It didn't get its due and was a box-office disaster (mainly because of its unbearable, out-of-the-place song sequences). Still, people who have seen it have all the praises.It has been years when we last saw it. But, My Brother Hemant and I (film buffs) still consider it as one of the best in its Genre.Though I liked KAHAANI, but since it was almost a rip off of KHOJ, there was nothing new to offer. As a matter of fact, KHOJ is more edge of the seat and has more twist n turns than KAHAANI.Watch it if you can 'find' its DVD. Because, I'm still Khoj'ing' ;)",

Though the movie does not screen the terrorism, except few shots, the cinema revolves about the prevailing terrorism- activities and its eradication that is demanded by society. The story emphasizes, around the existing internal flaws within the country's Intelligence Bureau, and harm caused by the educated high ranked class to their fellow beings, in addition with, finding for the ruining elements in the society. Sujoy Ghosh has created a balanced mean, between softness and aggressiveness, in handling mental status of main character role, without any mismatch to be found by the viewer in the 120 minutes. The actress has indeed proved again, that she herself can carry the entire movie, not allowing the viewers to shift their eye lids. The story is also imbibed with contract killer's short-welcomed killing, adding the weight to the thriller. The supporting roles of Mr.Khan and Mr Rana have performed well, proving their presence necessary in the story. The similes brought about in the end of Maa Durga and Mrs. Bagchi is worth noting. The pregnant women traveling from west to east, in search of her husband- Arnab, keeps audience ask themselves \"where is he?\", which turns in the later part as \"who is he?\" finally getting the answer in stunning movie \"Kahaani\".",

Keeps you hooked from start to end, keeps you guessing and blows you with a fine logical end. The story is shot in great Kolkata and the glimpses are well shot. No attempt to push humor is likable. No unnecessary badly placed songs. Amitabh's Ekala Chalo Re touches the heart. Top that with a great acting by Divya and well supported by unknown but mature characters around. Inspector Rana and Khan both are well portrayed. Divya is amazing and this is a MUST Watch ... even for H'wood lovers like me :) Do not miss the first shot !!!",

The entire movie just trudges along with nothing ever really happening that does anything for your senses. I will be very direct in my review.** Below average storyline \u2013 Everything was more or less predictable. Throughout the movie you wait for something to happen, but it doesn't. Everyone's dropping clues all the time in the entire movie. Give the viewer some credit for possessing a brain. Please hit me with a hammer on my head!! And the story drags on far too long in the end.** Poorly developed characters. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the characters were not developed at all. They were just toeing lines with no passion.** Bad acting \u2013 Plain simple bad acting. Vidya Balan cannot act.** Very weak script. Severe identity crisis here. The dialogue is certainly not realistic, and definitely not commercial.** No attention to detail \u2013 yes there are some decent shots of durga puja and Calcutta in general, probably thrown in for some vanity.And seriously, this is how national security crap is solved.I don't know what it is about Hindi movies (commercial, non-commercial alike), for some reason they will just tie every single loose end for you.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.PS: Someone in another review wrote that the movie is a copy of some Hollwood movie but couldn't figure out which one.

            "content": "Its only now i could watch kahaani properly so here goes my belated review In the world of bollywood where most of suspense thriller are made with zero I.Q, kahaani is definitely a class apart. For once in a long... long.... time we get to experience a movie that doesn't treat us like a mentally retarded person. Kahaani is a well crafted story and has been directed perfectly by Sujoy Ghosh. most of the time directors of b-town usually go overboard, overrated, over clich\u00e9d and what else over they can find, or xerox copy some popular foreign movies, or put some totally non-sense flash back,or an out of this world and their sense twist at the end,or some \"i wasn't dead u dummy\" stuff / \" i have a twin identical idiotic brother u idiot \" crap or what not to make such film. From this trend, kahaani is a refreshing and much needed break.For once there is a story and it slowly and brilliantly unfolds as the movie progresses. For once Characters are all normal, mere mortal human beings, not usually angry and above all people we can easily relate to (something u almost never see in bollywood). The story twist and turns without drag and finally fits perfectly at the maha (but not overrated) twist at the end. It has all the elements of a brilliantly crafted investigative thrillers and each new lead points to a new direction. script uses small instances to change the direction of story rather than something over dramatic. the story is the true heart & soul of this movie. Direction is top class and sews these twist and turn of the script in an exciting manner.Performance wise vidya balan is brilliant showing a wide range of emotion with relative ease. The performance of all other co-stars are also superb, especially that of bob biswas and his \"ek minute\". frankly that guy is as scary and psychotic as anything u will ever see. i think u can make an entire film on this guy though he is in this movie for just 10 minutes or something.another notable thing about this movie is its cinematography and camera work. whether it is the colors of Calcutta or festivities of durga pooja or vibrance of bengali people, it's brilliantly captured in every frame.so as all top rated critics in most of the channels and particularly in one say \"i will go with 7/10 for Sujoy Ghosh's kahaani.It's a brilliant written story where every twist and turn creates a new kahaani\" ( no prizes for guessing who that particular one is :) )",

The script was loose and had many filler materials. A Khan,brilliantly acted though, but according to the script the IB had waited on Vidya Balan's entry to resume on the search of Damji's and virtually gave her almost full access to whatever investigation that was going on. SHE WAS A HACKER..pheww... Information gathering looked preety easy,even desi CID's toil hard for clues whereas Balan just moved around and kept getting clues.This made A.Khan look silly,couldn't IB get a hacker to simply trace back ip's.???

Everybody plays a role in the movie and has acted superbly but this is Vidya's movie inside out. All through the movie we wonder what is the driving force behind this lady's determination. How the hell can she handle so much? Her whole world is crashing and yet she stands tall, unfazed.

All the jokes although from subtitles, the over-acting, got me. As years went by and started detaching myself from Bollywood movies, finding movies that are more realistic and logical in nature. Yep, I found Lagaan, 3 Idiots, Tare Zameen Par, Rang De Basanti - basically Aamir Khan still gives me faith for Bollywood. But I want more. And then I got to know about Vidya Balan when she was nominated for Time Magazine 100 Most Influential. I started to go through her movies list. I watched 'No One Killed Jessica'. Not quite hooked. But Kahaani? It's definitely another story!My major kudos for Kahaani is dedicated to the background score. It definitely sets the mood just right. Made me feel nervous, sad, angry and all. Next is the cinematography. Instead of choosing hot-spots, the director decided to brilliantly use the city of Kolkatta and manipulate the Durga Dewi celebration to help the storyline. Splendid move indeed!In the acting department, I could never dispute the ability of Vidya Balan carrying this movie from start to end. She command and conquer every scene. The supporting casts are excellent as well. In summary, Kahaani brought honesty in its portrayal along the fiction it delivers. The storyline, woven with sceneries of places and faces of Kolkatta locals really created an experience to remember. I agree with most critics saying that the storyline and clues is too long and are too many that in the middle, it was tiring to catch up, but overall Kahaani still manage to give a climax that I fail to expect. Bollywood heroes, watch out. Can you guys stand next to Vidya and not be overshadowed by her?",

            "content": "Kahaani is essentially the story of a heavily pregnant London based Tamil woman's search for her missing Bengali husband in Kolkata, underplayed exuberantly by Vidya Balan. The supporting cast comprises of a helpful cop Parambrata, a selfish detective - Siddiqui, an eccentric life insurance agent - Saswata, and a bhadralok Police officer - Khwaraj, and last but not the least, of a 300+ year old city - Kolkata seeped in the throes of celebrating the mother of all festivals - Durga Puja.The film unfolds like the pages of a gripping novel by Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes and is shot like that of an Alfred Hitchcock or a Satyajit Ray. Using real people, places, and situations to underline the nuances of the story is a task that's handled brilliantly by director Sujoy Ghosh (also the co writer) whose recent claim to shame - an abysmal Aladdin, or a horrendous Home Delivery shall soon be forgotten just as Madhur Bhandarkar's debut dud was.In addition to the sterling performances and the plot is the terrific technical support. Be it Amitabh Bacchan's rendition of Tagore's 'Ekla Chalo Re', the background songs (mostly of RD Burman), playing innocently as the characters travel the length and breadth of the city, the costumes by Sabyasachi, the 'just right and yet dramatic' background score, the non-condescending cinematography that captures the city as if it were a character, and the supreme screenplay with a spattering of real Bengali, act as just the right spices to turn this into a delicious dish, that's both exotic as well as commonplace.Watch this film to experience something so satiating, you would surely ask for more (a rare for a thriller!). I give this a 10/10 not just because this is one of the best thrillers ever made in India, but definitely one of the best films to have ever come out of Bollywood. Kudos to the whole team! Trust me! Ami Sotthi Bolcchi!",

After watching this classic piece I understood why Vidiya Balan is called the goddess of Awards. She could win more after this one! Other characters did well job too.

            "content": "A story of how a movie surprises the common non-movie going movie addict into almost admitting that the Indian Film Industry (stupidly called bollywood) MAY still have a chance of catching up with Hollywood in terms of thought,direction (both of which is found in abundance in India) and what pleasantly surprised me-execution. Herein may lie the anatomy of an Indian flick not reaching out to the global audience with the relatively refined sensitivities.Indian movies have been compromising on the execution department ranging between \"slightly\" to \"depends on the target audience\" scale.Interestingly, \"kahaani\" has no such (mis?)conceptions that come as an added liability. The flick is short compared to Indian standards-around 2 hours give and take a few.It is fast and gripping and I found it mandatory to latch on to it as an unwritten rule.Pacy yet a little laid back for a suspense somewhere,sharp contrasts in its best moments and the utter lack of unnecessary gimmicks takes \"kahaani\" an entire level above commonly produced Hindi flicks. The actors do their job.Vidya Balan nails the character bang on.At the same time,the film is balanced very well.Unlike a usual Hindi block- buster,every other character in the movie makes an equally lasting impact.I still very clearly remember the boy standing outside the class at the school as a punishment who features for about 7-8 seconds and all his mannerisms.A job well done.Khan,Rana,Bob,the little kid in the lodge-basically everybody come to be seen as characters more than good actors.Better explained,next time I come face to face with Nawazuddin Siddiqui,I most certainly won't be using his name.It will have to be Khan.Basically,all the characters convince you just as much as they should.But well,then they do-in most films.But where \"Kahaani\" wins is the feeling still persists even after you are done analyzing the film about 4-5 hours after watching. This being an entirely personal view,I would say the film (overall- considering the script,direction and the execution as I said earlier) could well be a somewhat Indian make of a combination of the films \"Apocalypto\" and \"The Departed\".The pace and uncertainty I felt while watching \"The Departed\" and that feeling of a very desperate and (probably) predictable manhunt/chase describing an array of interesting portraits from \"Apocalypto\" combined into one-that what most might feel after this 2 hour experience.Almost perfect.Although,if it might have been possible at all,one could have avoided those extra 7-8 minutes at the end with the Amitabh Bachhan voice-over and (yet again!) the typical Indian style end of everything happening for a reason (yes-reason is good-although it usually robs you and your film of a very good and crisp probable end) and even more importantly,the reason being explained and justified.It paints the tail of the movie with a very marginal tag of being a typical and non-dashing(yes,I am experimenting a lot with words her) end.Cut out that part,finish it crisply without inducing a sense of national justice and you could have had an end worth \"The Departed\".But yet again-Indian audiences.Here I would love to think that the director thought of such an end and decided against it to suit the masses.Just because a person who has worked almost flawlessly along the length of the movie would have really wanted it to end like a true global classic.But well-\"kahaani\" is in its own way,a true classic.Do watch.",

But the woman who made us share her journey and made us feel for her in each and every moment is V/Bidya Balan.Its all in the walking the behaving never did she look uncomfortable in her role as a pregnant woman in her desperate search.The scenes of Vidya with the kids touched my heart.She portrayed her character so greatly and made her character so much believable when she is in joy or when her mental strength breaks u also seem to feel the moments with her.And in the climax her final stare at her adversary was so powerful it said it all.The movie was more or less a perfect thriller with all the nail biting moments in between like the interval scene.You keep guessing throughout the movie but you never actually reach there before climax.Sujoy Ghosh gave us a brilliant piece of work and this movie will remain close to the people of Kolkata for a very long time.",

Khan)The movie is about a pregnant software engineer Vidya Bagchi, who comes to Kolkata from London in search of her husband, who was in India on an assignment and went missing. Cops are unable to trace any records of her husband in the guest house, office or even airport immigration. When Vidya learns that her husband had a lookalike and perhaps that could get him closer to her search, things take a drastic turn. When her personal quest turns into a political conspiracy.Rana is charming as Vidya's cop-companion and makes for a good supporting character. Khan as the crude intelligence officer exudes solid screen presence and confidence. All the characters in the movie have done justice to their roles. Every one complementing each other, the script the story & the direction. The climax is just so powerful and will give you goosebumps. Not seen like in Bollywood before. Music consists of two songs, different from stream line cinema.If you want to relish a suspense thriller with a fascinating story and a masterful performance by Vidya Balan, I recommend watching Kahaani.

That movie has a nice and almost picture perfect storyline, nice camera direction, and excellent acting ability. Everything a nice movie must have as per my perception. Then why the hell I am feeling like giving it another thought? This movie even utilized the songs properly, handled the shooting location with excellence, and moreover had a girl as main protagonist. Then? What is my problem when I tried thinking whether this will make my top 10 favorites? I could not convince myself to insert Kahaani in my top ten favorites. This movie is lacking something, I felt. After giving it much more thought, I solved this weird puzzle. This movie definitely is a thriller, but it failed to provide me a long lasting food for thought on which I could have been fed on for at least a week. Once I solved the mystery that is told in this movie and also handled few untied strings attached to this story, I don't have another underlying story in it to think about. I mean it is done. There is no more puzzle. No weirder angle in which I can try to watch the movie through. This thriller is simply finished. But I still can think of another new angle to watch Shutter Island, Shawsank Redemption, Before Sunrise, Nayak, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, Madly Bangalee, Wake Up Sid or even Paan Singh Tomar. There are quite a lot of them in Bengali movies amongst the ones I got the opportunity to watch. There is no point naming them. But the point I am trying to make is that whether I said \"Oh I have to watch this again\" just after I finished watching it once. And I am still continuing to watch them. Because they are still providing me enough food for thought what Kahaani definitely failed to do. To me Kahaani will be another Hindi movie with a nice story, fantastic actors and making a difference with having a woman as main protagonist (although there was a little hint that Darshan Jariwala, the Intelligence Head, was behind all of this). So to conclude, for me this nice Hindi Thriller is not in top 10, and definitely not a thought provoking one.",

I watched Kahaani the other day with my wife and both of us thoroughly enjoyed it and I felt that this movie is a welcome and good departure from the usual Bollywood formula. The fact that the movie has done pretty well commercially is the real cherry on the cake. Kudos to the entire cast and crew and other background teams for having come up with a commendable effort with this. The movie itself, it has a pretty tight script. You are thinking through the movie and the script forces you to think in different directions - why is Vidya running around 7 months pregnant? Why did Milan and Arnab look alike? Why did Arnab have to come to NDC to work where his lookalike used to work 2 years back? Why did Arnab meet Vidya 2 years back, around the same time as the terrorist attack? Are Milan and Arnab one and the same? Why is there a subtle romance plot between Rana and Vidya? Why is IB (all the way from the chief level) so interested in this random woman who has come looking for her husband? If Arnab is Milan then why is he waiting to kill Vidya? While you keep thinking about all this, the story unwinds to reveal one twist after the other. Although there maybe minor goofs and loose ends, you will walk out thoroughly entertained after watching Kahaani. Brilliant performances by Vidya Balan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Parambrata Chatterjee and Sasawata Chatterjee. Not too sure if these performances would translate to more opportunities for any of them in Bollywood, but they are in the national spotlight nevertheless.",

But as soon as 'KAHAANI' started with an obvious incident and Vidya Balans entry to Kalighat police station, I realized that this movie had a feel different to any other so called Bollywood thriller and Oh boy what a movie it was. Vidya Balan steals the show and 10 on 10 for her acting. All the characters Rana(Parambrata),Khan(Nawazuddin Siddiqui), Bob Biswas(Saswata Chatterjee) have played their part exceptionally well. I am not going to disclose anything about this movie. I will just say its a must watch. THE BEST BOLLYWOOD THRILLER EVER",
